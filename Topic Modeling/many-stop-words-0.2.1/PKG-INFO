Description: Many Stop Words
        ===============
        
        Simple Python package that provides a single function for loading sets
        of stop words for different languages.
        
        Stop words in English, French, German, Finish, Hungarian, Turkish,
        Russian, Czech, Greek, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Catalan, Polish, Hebrew, Norwegian,
        Swedish, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish, were retrieved from the
        following sources:
        
         * Wiktionary lists of prepositions in the respective languages
         * Perseus: http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/stopwords
         * Ranks.nl: http://www.ranks.nl/resources/stopwords.html
         * Google: http://code.google.com/p/stop-words/
         * Kevin Bouge: https://sites.google.com/site/kevinbouge/stopwords-lists
         * NLTK
        
        The directory called `orig` contains the original files used to
        compile the stop word lists.  The directory called `not_used` contains
        raw data for creating more stop words lists for languages that are not
        yet available in `many_stop_words.available_languages`
