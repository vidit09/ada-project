It wouldn't bother me except the episodes were marketed as the show trying to reach across the pond and acknowledge its American audience.  Flooding a story with stereotypes you hold about that audience does not do that.

Similarly, I had a hard time enjoying listening to Matt Smith read The Runaway Train because every single character that wasn't the Doctor or Amy sounded like John Wayne.  Most of the characters were supposed to be Confederate soldiers and, while it was certainly possible that some of them were from Texas or something, I doubt most of them were.  Captain Britt is even described as being from Georgia or Tennessee IIRC (which I might not) and even he has a thick western accent.  And also I didn't much care for the story.

true,Talonwhal,null,null,"&gt; airsure tracking does not mean that it has some device in the package that can be satellite tracked or something - it just means that when it arrives at each point it is scanned - so it has been scanned at the office you gave it into and won't get scanned again until it arrives at the sorting office in Canada

You seem to be confusing this partially with ""International Signed For"". This service is only tracked a few times eg. when it leaves, when it arrives in the other country, and when it's been delivered.

Airsure, on the other hand has slightly more tracking, in 6 stages:

 * Post Office® (for those items paid for and posted at the Post Office® branch)
 * Local mail centre
 * Royal Mail International processing centre
 * Office of Exchange overseas
 * Mail Centre overseas
 * Delivery Office overseas

So the OP is quite right in assuming something has gone wrong, there *definitely* should have been tracking updates by now, there is absolutely no way this is being handled correctly regardless of the situation in Canada.

Being mis-sorted is a possibility but they are often caught even if they are mis-sorted initially, however it is possible that it hasn't been caught and has gone with the standard mail as suspected. Then it will end up in the backlog like everything else.

If it hasn't arrived in 25 days then you can claim for it, however unless you paid for additional compensation (up to £500) then you're not likely to get much.. even then it's not exactly the $2000 you seem to have the potential for losing here. You shouldn't really send anything over the value of £500 with this service, I guess.. but too late for that now, so...

It seems Royal Mail are being kinda unhelpful here, honestly - with Airsure and the way it's tracked they should deifnitely at least be admitting that they screwed up either at the Post Office or elsewhere. I'd try calling them or visiting the Post Office again armed with this knowledge regarding the tracking and see what they have to say. Unfortunately as I mentioned even if they lost it completely you won't necessarily get much of the value anyway (although sometimes they are quite generous). They may however be able to investigate and figure something out.

The employer would have a reasonably strong case in the county court in these circumstances.

But if no notice period is specified, then don't feel like you should serve some duration plucked out of your manager's ass.

In fact, 10's decision to finally give in to the ""He will knock four times"" prophecy and meet with the Ood at the beginning of The End of Time could be a direct result of meeting 11 during a multi-doctor story. Hell, the last thing you could see of 10 in this multi-doctor story could be 10 doffing the Hawaiian flowers and the straw hat to finally face his own destiny after meeting 11 and seeing how 8 (presumably) sacrificed himself to end the Time War and let himself regenerate into 9. (It also wouldn't hurt that 10 witnessing 8's sacrifice to end the Time War would dovetail nicely with his own sacrifice to preserve 8's sealing of the Time Lords/Rassilon/Gallifrey in that time-lock.)

&gt;Writer Russell T Davies, in the episode's commentary, called the implication of this scene ""a theory"" as to the Face of Boe's origins, prompting Executive Producer Julie Gardner to urge him to ""stop back-pedaling"" about the two characters being the same. Davies also said that after writing the scene he inserted a line in the ADR recording for ""Gridlock"" in which the Face of Boe calls the Doctor ""old friend"".[1] However, Davies doesn't like making the relationship explicit, stating ""the moment it became very true or very false, the joke dies"". He has refused the publication of spin-off novels and comic books that have tried to definitively link the two.[2]

Obivously, in terms of starting at CB in the EPL week in, week out, Kelly and Wilson are still a little bit inexperienced, but they'll be great CBs in a year or two. There's also Ayala, who has been playing well in the Championship on loan.

That leaves us with Agger, Skrtel, Carragher and Kyriagos. If Agger is fit, he's the best ball playing CB in the league (apart from maybe Luiz). Skrtel and Carragher are still two of the best CBs in the league, and Kyriagos, while sometimes a little clumsy, is one of the best when it comes to challenging in the air.

I guess the question is, if Agger is injured, are we confident in Skrtel and Carragher, with Kelly/Wilson and Kyriagos as cover on the bench? Personally, I am.

One of these three alongside a ball playing, preferably pacy CB works great, but having two of them in together doesn't work so well.

Obviously if you do specify a mileage limit then you 100% need to stick below it and to document the current mileage at the start of the policy and on every renewal.

Also look at adding a voluntary excess, that sometimes helps a bit. Lastly if this was with one of the main insurers then try a smaller more specialist firm. I did that when I was first driving and it made a big difference, I've done the same thing in recent years with cars that the main insurers don't want to touch (imports etc), there are companies out there who advertise young-driver schemes.

Quality of live is pretty decent - York has some bad areas, but on the whole it's a great place to live and they really try to look after it. It varies per city - i vastly prefer living in York to say Leeds, but on the whole Yorkshire is not too bad. 

Doncaster on the other hand is very poor, lots of chavs, pretty messy place. They don't look after it, and I don't really like the people there.

Chavs are a fact of life everywhere, York doesnt have that many, but sadly they do exist. Leeds has lots of them. Doncaster is pretty much Chavland.

Internet is pretty awful outside major cities - i work just outside the York ring road and we get 2mb - 1 mile down the road my friend has 52mb. In doncaster it's better (bigger commercial and industrial demand), it tends to depend on the area a lot.

Culture and things to do Yorkshire generally has a lot of - there's many historical sites , museums, parks, as well as music venues and so on. 

Social Cohesion is always hard to judge, and it tends to vary per location. - some towns have high immigration (leeds, bradford in particular), but others have very little, so its quite different. York does pretty well as most of it's different cultures come for educational reasons and are pretty intelligent as a result of that.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;At what point did the Time Lords get locked in a ""time freeze""? I always assumed the Master and the Doctor were the only two left at that point.

The time lock surrounding the Daleks and Time Lords was (probably) either the last act of 8 or first act of 9. This was actually answered in the comic The Forgotten, but it is of questionable canon\*. The Master escaped because he was biologically human at the time through the use of the chameleon arch. There may be a few others the Doctor hasn't found yet, plenty of Daleks escaped.

&gt;I have another question. If the doctor rebuilt the TARDIS from a TARDIS junk-yard, why is the chameleon circuit still stuck as a police box?

Are you referring to The Doctors Wife? The Tardis he built there wasn't *the* TARDS, but a makeshift one he used to catch up to it after House stole it.

* Permission to 'chug' from the local authority is only given in respect of a small defined area.

Of course, footfall comes in peaks and troughs so sometimes it appears that four people is far too many.
* When in a team of four, typically two people will target people walking in one direction and the other two the other direction. The people in each twosome start close enough to see each other and minimise   double-starts like those you describe. In practice you're trained to make eye contact with passers-by and keeping an eye on a team-mate is difficult. Such positioning is not always possible (e.g. path too narrow, rival charity shop nearby). Further, if there's nobody coming in their direction most poeple will turn around and take a punt on anyone the other twosome may have missed.

*Attacking a police officer by throwing bottles – 10 months

*Encouraging others to KILL police officers – 12 months

*Revenge attack on property, with “attack” of person, person of good character – 18 months

*Taking part in a riot, repetitive attacks on riot police with state of mind to “re-arm” with projectiles, second offence – 3 years

Assuming the club signs him to a 2-3 year deal, he would be perfect to help out the club for the next few years and give Essien as much time as he needs to come back from his injury and/or to find a young, long term replacement .

Seriously though, there's been lots of in-canon evidence that there are ways around the 12 regeneration thing.

Similarly, Omega was going to ""steal"" the Doctor's regenerations in order to give himself physical form. 

In the new series they showed that Rassilon was resurrected during the Time War. Most recently in The Sarah Jane Adventures the 11th Doctor said he could regenerate hundreds of times if he wanted.

also from that article;
&gt;Now, perhaps the sentencing range (maximum 5 years) for this offence is too harsh, that’d be a fair stance to take.

Which is also what I was alluding to by asking what else you can do to get 16 months. As I said, I'm not shedding any tears for Charlie, but you know, this kind of headline grabbing conviction could convince some people not to attend future demonstrations.

Maybe it would work, but I'm not sure. I guess ideally, we would get Modric and a player like Tiote, but I can see how they would want a few players for cover in midfield after we were decimated by injuries last year.

They never say in canon that it's different guys, although the reboot with Craig would seem to indicate so. After all, in the original novels it was all the same guy, but the movies ran past the novels' content a long time ago.

For example, Recoverytwo above (below?) me points out that Roger Moore (the 3rd Bond) visits the grave who seems to be his wife (the wife that George Lazenby (2) married); on the same hand, when Lazenby was cast, one of his quips was, ""this never happened to the other guy."" 

But, aside from that, it also helps explain the idea of each Doctor being the same sort of guy, but each Doctor's series can have a different tone and format. Comparing, say, Moore's campy series of films with Dalton's dark, violent ones, isn't too different from trying to compare, say, Five's easy-going friendliness with Nine's PTSD.

Here's the example I give to all Americans. The equivalent to the Queen's husband is the President's wife.

Hence the fact that the Queen's husband is the 'Prince Consort' not a King. A King is a head of state, a Prince consort is married to a head of state.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Hello.

I'm 20, passed my test last June and I've just got my first car (a 2001 Fiesta). £1,500 insurance, which isn't bad at all.

THINGS TO REMEMBER:

- Less mileage doesn't always mean better prices. I've got a mate who does insurance underwriting for some of the smaller prices and they see people with low mileage as more of a risk, since you're driving less than others - therefore gaining less experience. Aim for around 7,000 - 8,000.

- Admiral is great. Use them if you're in England.

- Don't get anything bigger than a 1.3 litre for your first car. 

- As you probably already know, never put yourself as the main driver. If your first driver has been driving for years with no claims, it WILL make a big difference. Add a second driver and the difference isn't so drastic (with Admiral it was pennies) but always make sure you put an experience driver as the primary.

- Multi-car insurance tends to be cheaper overall since firms will go out of their way to keep you and the family with them. Call them up. Use this to your advantage. 

- The time since passing your test DOES make a difference, even if you're off the road. I didn't drive from June 2010 until June 2011, but the insurance dropped a few grand within the first year.

Good luck! It is a piss take, but there's nothing we can really do about it, aside from an utter rehaul of insurance throughout the EU. ",0,1310759483,null,0,false,0,c25vl7d,t3_iqdfa,t1_c25vl7d,t3_iqdfa,1427353645,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

All sorts of things effect insurance prices and each company has their own way of deciding what to charge you, just limiting your view to a few things is to miss the point entirely. Insurance is so that they can pay to fix all the stuff that you break when you crash this includes not only your car, but other people's cars, houses public property. If the price of housing, labour, materials has gone up then the price of insurance will go up irrespective of the type of car, age of driver etc.

&gt; 2 - That is a ridiculous generalisation

Actually it isn't since I didn't base my opinion on a couple of examples I based it on the accident rates in the UK by driver age. I gave examples of a larger trend. The figure are easy to look up. Young drivers have far more accident than older drivers.

&gt; Why is it acceptable to discriminate younger drivers?

Age doesn't have the same legal protection as race/gender. If their business model means that they can charge young drivers more then they will because they are currently legally able to do so. Companies do what is legal (for the most part) not what you think is moral. 

The [AAs](http://www.theaa.com/insurance/young-drivers-car-insurance.html) take on this is that young drivers are a higher insurance risk since they have a disproportional higher accident rate. [Other](http://www.lbp.police.uk/freedom-of-information/publications/l%20%20b%20road%20crash%20statistics.pdf) [sources](http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/3494/1/3494.pdf) agree with this view. To attempt to argue anything else is to ignore the facts.

&gt; I can take your argument and turn it around by saying that I know many under 24 year olds who have been driving since they were 17 and hadn't had a single accident. And I do know them!

true,Linlea,null,null,"The problem is we're talking about car insurance, not stop and searches. You're taking the field of commerce; which is governed by a certain range of principles, and then comparing it with the field of criminality;, which is governed by another. You're also talking about correlation (in the case of minority group crime rates) rather than causation. In motor insurance age (inexperience) is taken to be a *causal* link, not a correlation. In minority groups race is not taken to be a *cause* of crime, it's taken to *correlate* with it. That method of using un-natural or incompatable analogies - or examples from different fields of life - leads to flawed conclusions. 

Note though that if you live in a poor area that had a high property crime rate you actually *would* find that you would have to pay higher home insurance rates, so your example of people living in poverty with a high crime rate - when brought back to the relevant topic of insurance, rather than assumptions of criminality and the field of morality - does *already* demonstrate that it is legal to charge a higher insurance rate (as long as the area does have a demonstrable higher risk of property crime, or is an evidence based higher risk of loss of money to the insurance company). By charging higher property insurance rates in that instance the insurance company isn't *assuming* that they're criminals absent proof; they're *knowing* that there is higher risk, based on *the hard evidence of current pay outs* in that area. So when you bring the analogy back to the relevant topic (insurance pay outs and their effect on insurance premiums) rather than a limited relevance topic (assumptions of criminality) I think the analogy shows the opposite of what you're trying to get it to show. 

I think you're also really talking about discrimination in the sense of prejudice (unfavourable discrimination without regard to reason, or based on emotive or moral preconceptions) rather than just discrimination: I think that's the case because you immediately moved the discussion to areas that are often governed by discrimination *based on prejudice* (race and sexuality) rather than just discrimination.

There are many of their kind that are involved in criminal activities, yet pointing it out is incredibly offensive (I do apologise if anybody is offended by the above example, I have absolutely nothing against the aforementioned race, in fact I am saying this to prove my point about ""ridiculous generalisations"").

Age doesn't have the same legal protection - true. Does that mean it's ethically acceptable to discriminate like that?

And since we're talking about ""figures"" and how they back your theories up and don't back mine up, let's look at a completely different issue, unrelated to what we're talking about. Marijuana prohibition. Why? Because ""statistics"" say that it is a gateway drug, that it has higher rate of addiction, that it causes violence and even murders etc. All of these things are WRONG!

It is as much of a gateway drug, as users want it to be. Cannabis does not have any kind of chemical substance that forces people to try stronger drugs (heroin, cocaine etc.).

Higher addiction rates? Let's not even start talking about this, because it's been scientifically proven that it is far less addictive than tobacco, alcohol and even caffeine, the bullshit is there to scare people into believing that marijuana is a bad drug.

Causes violence? You mean when people kill each other for marijuana because the drug deal didn't go as planned? That deal that wouldn't be an illegal act in the first place if marijuana wasn't banned? So people kill each other BECAUSE it's illegal? Makes sense now.

Watch out for some sites like LV and whatever that one Iggy Pop advertises.  The way they get lower quotes is to disqualify certain people (ie. you) from getting quotes at all.

It's also worth noting that if you put the same quote through the same company next week, it will be likely be different.  You can save the quotes for a few weeks and buy the cheapest.

**[Read moneysavingexpert's advice](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/insurance/car-insurance-young-drivers)**

Try putting fully-comp instead of 3rd party.  

&gt;While it's likely third-party buyers are on average a higher-risk group, perhaps as overall they care less about their cars, and so prices are pushed up. To illustrate this, in one low-risk driver quote we found £290 for fully-comprehensive, compared to £406 for third-party. This isn't a hard rule, but always check both.

That does seem wrong to me though. Assuming young men really are more of an accident risk than old (or young) women -- and I've never seen any actual data that says they are, I've only heard it repeated as a fact by all sources, even ones that disagree with men being charged more -- then it should be OK to charge them more. If it's based on a prejudice; that men are perceived as worse drivers, or are perceived as the weaker sex or unable to control their emotions or something like that, then obviously they shouldn't be charged more - but if it's based on an objectively true observable fact then it should be OK to charge them more.

  You said and i quote ""Atheism is the lack of a religion. You're referring to it as if it were a religion, like all atheists have one unifying view / ideals."" and as per the definition of [ATHEISM](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/atheism) then Atheism forms one unified belief that there are no deities, if that belief wavers from that stance then it is categorized as something else like Agnostic, ect.

I liked the touch of darkness in Eccleston's Doctor, where it was always implied he'd done things in the time war that haunted him. Tennant touched upon the doctor as a fundamentally lonely character as well, doomed to eventually watch everything he loves die around him. I haven't gotten that tinge of darkness as much with Smith honestly. Based on his work with House, I think it'd be safe to say that Laurie could probably pull off a very intelligent character with a layer of self-loathing just beneath the surface.

Not to say the Doctor should be completely grimdark with no room for silliness. I just would personally like to see the next doctor explore the dark side of the character a little more.",0,1310791789,null,0,false,0,c25yl1t,t3_ir0fn,t1_c25yl1t,t3_ir0fn,1427355058,17,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,17

I think the fifth, sixth, and seventh doctors were more or less equal, though I thought Colin Baker was an asshole.  
I didn't care for the movie, it felt like a terminator knockoff for some reason, perhaps because of the snake thing that The Master became.
People give Escelon a lot of shit, but looking back over his episodes, I find that he has an amazing range as an actor.  As someone commented here a while ago, when he was happy, he was great, when he was angry, his wrath, terrifying.  
As for putting Matt Smith so low, I don't think he has the range of emotions nor the authority that the other doctors do, though that could be because of Smith's age.  I think I just can't stop comparing him to Tennant's and Eccleston's incarnations.  I was almost in tears when The Tenth Doctor regenerated, he made me feel like I was losing a beloved friend.  I'm watching the End of Time as I am typing this, and you just can't compare Smith to Tennant.  
I never listened to any of the audioplays, or read any of the books/comics, so I can't weigh in about them.  
I included the Valeyard because he is, technically, *A* Doctor, even though he is usually not included in the list.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Didn't the London Torchwood capture the TARDIS for a while before Canary Bay?  We were assured that it was safe, since nobody could get into it...but what if that wasn't true?  We know that they only had it for a brief period of time, from the Doctor's perspective...but what if they got into it and used it to run a series of missions for Queen and Country?  If they had a proper manual for a Type 40 and a team to pilot it, they could conceivably have done a *lot* of damage while the Box was offscreen, and returned it before the Doctor noticed.

It would make a lot of sense if they had a protocol for ""Captured the TARDIS""  all worked out in advance, and started running the playbook - use this artifact to get it in, use this relic to decode the controls, and then we start to fix things.  Every time the Doctor dropped the ball and got people killed, or let Great Britian suffer for the integrity of the timeline or to avoid murdering aliens...they're going to take the shot.

The first few missions should be collecting gear - our guns don't work on Cybermen or Daleks, so let's go raid some people who have advanced hardware.  Then, we drop a science team on a nice, hospitable time/space location and skip ahead 10 years to see what our boffins have reverse engineered from the stolen tech.  We jump to a more advanced race of galactic menaces and score some of their stuff, then drop it back off at the science base and let them have another crack. After we've done this three times, we've watched our science team get decrepit, but now we have the ultimate combination of war tech from all of time and space.

In the second third of the game, we take our new gear against the worst invasions that have hit humanity.  We wipe the floor with the Cybermen over a few missions, and then start to go after the Daleks. We continue to hand them their canned keisters until we hit the Dalek's trump card - they have time travel too.  We get to watch them execute our science lead...our science lead when he was 30 years younger.  Our timeline collapses, our gear ceases to exist (best stuff first) and we barely escape.

In the third act, we are saved by a Doctor from post-Canary Wharf.  We explain ourselves, and he does the obligatory moralizing about how we can't shoot all our problems.  Then we get to help out as he executes some sort of plan that will stop the Daleks, but we have to do it with the original weapons - basically zero chance of stopping a Dalek, but they're proud, and they will chase you if you make them mad.  That could buy the Doctor enough time to leave them powerless in deep space.  At this point, you don't have enough troopers to decoy all the Daleks, so you loop yourself around - you distract the first Dalek (maybe trick him into an elevator shaft and drop it on him) and then jump into the TARDIS.  You have your crew jump you back five minutes and you draw the second Dalek off...as in the background, across the room, you can see your prior self running for his life! On the last loop, the Dalek realizes what's going on and you have to protect your prior selves from him, lest he EXTERMINATE you.

And I didn't comment on that. The truth is still true even if we don't like it.

&gt; And since we're talking about ""figures"" and how they back your theories up and don't back mine up, let's look at a completely different issue, unrelated to what we're talking about. Marijuana prohibition. Why? Because ""statistics"" say that it is a gateway drug, that it has higher rate of addiction, that it causes violence and even murders etc. All of these things are WRONG!

Actually no. The research on this shows that marijuana is safer than alcohol. Its prohibition is a political issue and nothing do do with the science.

&gt; The point I'm trying to make with this completely off-topic rant, is that statistics that media provide is BULLSHIT most of the time. And if you're stupid enough to believe them, then I award you no points, and may god have mercy on your soul.

You need to have a look what I linked to. The closet source to the media would be the AA. I then back that up with the government figures and if you didn't want to trust the government it also backed it up with an academic paper. None of these were the media and to classify them as such means you either intentionally wish to distort misclassify them to suite your point of view or that you didn't look at them.

What came up was they don't care too much about age or no claims (I was 21 with 4 years no claims) what really mattered was how long I had the license- that £5k will drop fast with age.

I'm not born in Liverpool, never even been there but I've supported the club since I was a little girl. Second hand or not the club and, by extension the rivalry, is still very real to me.

Yes, I may not have the same type of attachment as someone who is from Liverpool does but it doesn't make my love for the club any less real.

The EPL has always been a VERY big part of the Malaysian culture and during the season it's not uncommon to see large groups of fans from all the different clubs staying up till 3 or 4 in the morning watching the games together. I grew up watching the EPL and there IS a sense of loyalty and attachment and even a bit of, dare I say it, identity. 

I guess what I'm saying is, for me at least, the emotions really ARE there. I love the club, I'm sure I always will.

That said I'm not condoning what those fans in the video did. In this instance though I think mob mentality took over. We're all still a little sore from losing the League title record to Man U and to have this guy suddenly come in kissing his badge was probably just a little too much provocation for them.

The last time I was in Crete visiting a DJ friend of mine for a month I paid for a room upfront ( stupid mistake ) came back to the room on day three and all of my shit had been thrown out in the corridor so I went fuming to see the fat Greek lady owner. The conversation went a little like this ( it was a lot longer, but this is the gist ) : 

Me: WTF, all my stuffs been thrown out of the room? 

Her: I move new man in, he pay better rate

Me: What do you mean I've paid you for a month?

Her: He pay better rate, you go now. 

Me: Well give me my fucking money back then?

Her: No, you mess up room, I keep money. 

At this point I lose the plot, her fat husband turns up and they call the police, the police arrive, some Greek words are exchanged and I'm thrown out without my money, a fucking months worth of rent... gone. 

Honestly, this kind of shit happens all the time on Greek islands and there's nothing you can do about it, my whole time in Crete was riddled with stories like this, my mate worked for two weeks and they ripped him off with the money too, it's what they do. I'll say it again, they're fucking horrid people. You might be alright on a package deal, but don't even dream of trying to sort it out yourself.

It doesn't have an ideology, it's written by academics, to some degree for academics, &amp; they try to avoid talking about ideology at all because in academic circles you have to have so much justification to have a point be accepted that ideological debate is quite literally sneered at.
Any of the writers who do have an ideology attempt to not make it obvious, and if they do make it obvious, it'll be different every week.

I love the Economist because it generally tends to say ""this is the policy in the area. These are the problems that might make it fail. These are the costs of failure. Here are the reasons that it could work. These are the benefits associated with success. Here is a balanced judegment based upon the facts to weigh up whether the potential benefits outweigh the potential risk of failure. Fundamentally though, make up your own mind""

I hate almost every other paper because they fall on ideological debate far too easily.

I will still maintain that anarchism or communism won't work as desired until we live in a post scarcity society, and I can't see that happening for a long time, well beyond the point that the only relevance it has for us today is as a backdrop to speculative fiction.

But just as urbanization and industrialization started to dramatically alter our society in the 1700's which lead to new ideologies such as communism and socialism in the late 19th and early 20th century, I suspect we are going to see the development of a myriad of new political ideologies in the next hundred years or so, but thanks to the internet and a generally higher level of education they will go from essays to policy in a far shorter period of time.

But an instant problem we can solve is education. While we can't all be doctors and CEO's, the time where you could day dream your way through school until you could leave, then walk into a job is long gone. The problem is we haven't caught up with this yet as a society. Which is why I think the anger that's been focused on university education becoming more expensive is misplaced. No matter what it costs, it's clear the system isn't producing people that can be employed  and you can't just balance that with the fact we have a handful of world leading universities. We need to put a huge amount of effort into reforming education for ages 2-18, streaming, splitting into schools based on ability, for links with vocational and apprenticeships, the ability to hold failing students back a year, mandatory residential schools for kids who are seriously failing, the ability to withhold stuff like driving licenses for kids who fail to reach certain standards etc. You might want to talk about the beauty of education simply to fulfill the desire to learn, but for most people they just need education to ensure that they can contribute to our society as adults, especially as this contribution will require a vastly more educated and capable workforce than we can offer today.

Looking at your previous posts, I really doubt this. You are in teenager world. You've probably not thought about the obvious practicalities like visas, accomodation, sponsorship, work, living expenses or even what city/town you'll live in *etc etc*...

Have you thought about how much of an income you'll need to survive here? How far will 18k get you? 
Planning on being a 'music professor'? Do you have a PhD? Plan to get one here? Then you'll need a student visa, an offer from a UK university for an undergraduate degree (you need this first - no matter how talented you think you are) and enough money to pay the international student fees. Your 18,000 won't even cover tuition fees for one year, let alone living expenses and other stuff you've not even thought about.

T-mobile, 24 month contract

I paid about £150 to get the phone as it had just come out and the contract price was so low.

The best way to look at it is to add up the price of the phone and what you'll pay over the cost of the contract - over 2 years I'll pay £150+(£15x24) which is £510. £35 a month is £830 over 24 months - ouch!

I have to say... I'm worried with Carroll. Yeah I know, it's only a pre-season friendly and I'm overreacting but damn he was way off the pace in the first half. So much so that I'm not entirely convinced he wasn't drunk.

On several occassions he simply miscontrolled the ball under no, or very little pressure. You can see he was extremely frustrated with himself too, kicking away the ball a few times, so I'm hoping it was just a 'rough day at the office' for big Andy - the jetlag and climate are probably a huge hurdle for him.

Still, he did show he could deliver when needed last season so I think he should come good. I just wish he wasn't 35 mill.

Oh, and I'd say man of the first-half would have to be Adam. I was impressed with his drive in midfield, his willingness to drift deep to recieve the ball from the CBs, and his lofted passes were brilliant for Carroll. Someone mentioned he was too willing to attempt that, but I think with some better movement from our forwards/midfielders he wouldn't have to resort to it as often (as it was often to a lone figure of Carroll up front today).",0,1310826185,null,0,true,0,c2606rv,t3_ir8uo,t1_c2606rv,t3_ir8uo,1427355870,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

Second half was much better down to mainly one guy - Aquaman. What a boss player. I would much rather keep him than Meireles if it comes down to selling one TBH. Thought Shelvey and Kelly played brightly as well as N'Gog who showed us what we expect of him. Super excited for August 13.

true,JustifiedTrueBelief,lfc68,,"I see our midfield players rotating almost every game.  If we look at the players that will always start if healthy, we get Suarez, Gerrard, Lucas, Downing (or a future winger signing), Agger, Reina, and probably Carra. That leaves Carroll, Kuyt, Aqua, Adam, Meireles, Henderson, Maxi, et. al. competing for those last couple spots. This will make us amazingly flexible and give us a great chance of keeping everyone fit.

I think we'll play a 4-3-3 when Carroll is playing, and a 4-2-3-1 when Suarez is up top.  Our best set-up in my opinion is the latter, KK can just pick between playing Aqua or Adam.

--------------Suarez-------------

Downing---Aqua/Gerrard---Kuyt

---Gerrard/Adam---Lucas

LB---Agger---Carra---Johnson

.
.

This can change easily though, and we are now covered for almost any injury. I rate the positions as follows:

.

ST: Suarez, Carroll, Kuyt, N'Gog/Pacheco


LW: Suarez, Downing, Maxi, Kuyt, Pacheco

RW: Kuyt, Suarez, Downing, Henderson, Pacheco

CAM/CF: Gerrard, Suarez, Aqua, Kuyt, Meireles, Henderson, Pacheco, Cole

""Xabi Alonso"" role: Gerrard, Adam, Aqua, Meireles

Destroyer DM: Lucas, Gerrard, Spearing


LB: Cissokho (assuming we sign him), Aurelio, Insua, Robinson/Flanagan

RB: Johnson, Kelly, Carra

CB: Agger, Carra, Skrtel, Dann/whoever we sign, Kelly/Wilson/Ayala, Soto

GK: Reina, Doni, Gulacsi

That's some serious depth. Suarez, Gerrard, Lucas are probably the two most important and versatile players, but our season isn't over if one or two of them go down with an injury.

Thing is, insurance companies are in the business of making money. There is no incentive for them to discriminant against anyone *without a statistical basis*. And  they discriminant as much as they can, but based purely on what the data tells them. So, if women get cheap insurance, it is only because data shows they are less likely to cause accidents. Same with employed, white collar, old, married, homeowner, suburbanites or whatever.

Every single piece of info that the actuaries have available, they use to price risk, based on demonstrated correlation. I'm sure they would use race as well, *if they were allowed to collect that information*.

Now, to a liberal arts graduate, it screams of discrimination (what doesn't?).

In 1981 a vile man called Kelvin MacKenzie became editor of the Sun newspaper and made it an ultra-right wing populist paper (it had been left leaning before then), Murdoch also bought the Times, a very establishment paper.  With 40% of the newspaper market, Murdoch has far more influence in the press than would ever be allowed in the US.  The Sun has more readers than Fox news has viewers in a much smaller country. In the 80s he took on the print unions by sacking all the staff, he also got involved in Satellite TV in 1983 with a single channel, relaunching with a multichannel package in 1989.  This very nearly brought the whole of News Corps under; if Sky had carried on losing millions every day, there would be no Fox News or anything!  In 1992 the Sun claimed that it won the 1992 General Election for the Conservative government by printing highly negative stories and comment about the opposition party. My parents weren't overtly political, but I definitely grew up with the spectre of Murdoch as a sinister influence that no politician would have the guts to challenge.

If people never read the politics, even if it's front page stuff at election time, then in all likelihood they don't vote anyway.

Nope, no news from the UKMC committee on Stratford.  That's why I thought it was best to exempt the DLT from three pass contacts to avoid any contention.  Personally, I hope they formalise the extensions in the next edition (due later this year, if memory serves).  I know some of the traditionalists feel it goes against the spirit of the game, but I'd rather have a slightly shorter, more exciting game than one that drags on forever, constantly looping around the easy routes until enough of the key connections have been eliminated.

true,jawnn,lfc12,,"Great post, I agree with just about everything you've said. 

The only thing I'd add is that maybe Insua is now better off playing a wide left midfield role. Clearly he's into attacking, and I'd rather have a safety net with a strong defence than constantly worry about counter-attacks from clubs who know how to take advantage of that.

Malaysia seemingly has never seen a 1-2, as there were at least 5 occasions where they could easily have crippled us with the wide runs being made..the ball was served up to a forward player who just did NOT return the favor to the bursting forward widemen. It was really unfortunate to watch, almost reminded me of a handful of MLS games I've been watching. (Don't flame me, I'm from NYC - but let's just say they're lucky they're not the blue bulls)

Kelly is a wonderful prospect, and I also really hope he's just permanently fit.

I think the 1 important thing left out is the mention of Kuyt. We lacked flow in the first half, and the final third was a joke at times. I can't help but Kuyt is the forward Carragher, who brings that linkage and unity to the attack. We can go on and on about which qualities he has and doesn't have, but what can't be debated is how much of a team player he is. 

Lastly, fucking Carroll..He makes me want us to sign a striker. I don't think he realizes he's as big as he is, and playing the position he plays. At one point, I threatened my cat during the match because Carroll was in gum-spitting distance of little Flana at back. He tracks back seemingly to get a better view of the action, because dribbling is NOT his strongpoint and he's not about to play a woy-hoof to himself. YOU ARE THE TARGET-GEORDIE. Keep your big ass up the pitch, spitting on the shoulders of the defensive line and stay onside. The guy can nearly win headers over a keeper's extended arms, but he seemingly wishes he was a CM.

I currently get myself at least £7,500 in debt every year, the new policy would put me (assuming no drop in living costs of increase in support which as a poor student I'd probably get so this number would be smaller) at most £13,000 in debt.

Plus, where I do a technical course, there are only about 50% of people there who apply through student finance, the other half are international students, and wealthy domestic students who buy their way in on not necessarily better marks.
The new policy, whilst being more expensive does also put a limit on the number of rich people who can essentially buy a place by going directly to the uni, and also stops people who are from wealthy enough families from applying for student finance (ie if they fail to get in by offering to pay the uni direct, they can have a second go in with everyone else. &amp; it stops rich people getting a loan they'd just put in an ISA to get free money). On a course like mine, it'll probably greatly increase the likelyhood of a poorer individual getting accepted on the course. I was lucky because I got in when the department tried to get more students from poor families (so they could boast how open they were to such applicants) but they did this by just letting more people in in total.

EDIT2: Alright, I will elaborate.  First off, I'm not sexually attracted to him-- it kinda seems like this is the biggest factor in a lot of people's obsession with the guy.  In general I'm not a big fan of broadway showtune-y acting, and don't think it really jives with the show(s)-- I suppose I just don't really like his style of acting at all.  I don't buy a single emotion he forces onto his face.  His character in Torchwood just feels fake and cheesy compared to everybody else (although there are some incredibly bad actors in Miracle Day so far, hes better than them for sure), not to mention his gimmicks ""HEY LOOK GUYS IM ULTRA BISEXUAL"" and immortality get stale for me.

They killed off my favorite characters in S2 unfortunately (it made for some powerful tv though), and Peter Capaldi and a suprisingly decent storyline made S3 great.  Capn Jack/John Barrowman has worn thin for me.

You could argue very strongly that The Girl in the Fireplace is pretty strong science fiction stuff.  At it's core the plot is about a [stranded spaceship trying to find a way to repair itself](/spoiler) (what's the statute of limitations on spoilers?...anyway).  

However, the story is obviously about more than that.  If those windows opened out into a world full of flying cars and more robots you probably wouldn't get a single argument about whether or not it's really sci-fi.  Instead those windows open into the past, and the heart of the story is more about life, experiences, and the passage of time.  

I think if we took a look at good science fiction as a whole we'd see that often the true theme in those stories is about things that are timeless - human nature, relationships, etc.  It's the setting, or the focus on technology, that causes us to identify it as science fiction.

Most plausible, especially since scottish and canadian accents can share some specific traits, and it only takes one particular slip to set your ears off.

Err, not quite :s

At best, canada has a more homogenized accent that the states, which is definitely [not](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:English_dialects_by_continent) as [homogenized](http://www.aschmann.net/AmEng/) as one might believe from television and film.

So, Buxton is a strange town but I grew up there and had a great time.

It can be a bit like the League of Gentlemen at times but it also has some good stuff going for it too.

The town's main industries are tourism, the quarry(s) and agriculture.  

The town also has a big theatre and every year there is a big festival consisting of Opera and a fringe.  At the same time a fairground comes and the pubs stay open late.  I think because of this there are quite a few artsy /
hippy types in Buxton, but it takes a while to spot them.  They aren't as obvious as all the inbred hicks, farmers and labourers who speak in an almost incomprehensible Derbyshire accent.

Another plus point for Buxton is its close proximity to Manchester, which you can get to in 45minutes by train.   It is also surrounded by the peak district, and there are some great foody pubs and scenery just a few minutes drive from Buxton.

Depending on where you are moving from you might find the place a bit backward. But that can be quite amusing too.

Oh and the weather is shit.  If you drive for ten minutes out of Buxton you will find that the weather is so much warmer that the flowers bud a month earlier.

But in terms of just the pronunciation of vowel and consonant sounds, I usually do not detect any difference from my own accent. It could be due to a lack of ability to detect inflections unless they differ drastically from my own.

Contrary to popular belief, accents are not bound by state boundaries, and depending on how you define an the properties of an accent, the boundaries can change, and there are some with HUGE boundaries. The fact that people assign particular locations for an accent can cause issues. 

Indeed you would have an easier time hearing their accent if it was strong, opposed to a 'soft' one.

In 2006, just after the arrest of the NOTW's royal correspondent for phone hacking, Stephenson dined with Neil Wallis, then deputy editor of the NOTW, and a suspect in the ongoing investigation. Stephenson then hired him in 2009 as a PR advisor, while the MET was saying the meagre initial investigation did not need to be reopened.  [According to the NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/world/europe/17police.html?_r=1&amp;src=mv&amp;ref=general) he had a specific role of advising the MET about public relations relating to the phone hacking investigation, and during this period was reporting back to News International. Within two months of hiring Wallis Paul Stephenson went to visit the Guardian editor, Alan Rusbridger, saying that [their coverage of phone hacking was exaggerated and incorrect](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jul/15/phone-hacking-met-police-guardian?CMP=twt_gu) without mentioning that he had hired an ex-NOTW deputy editor and suspect in the case as an advisor. 

Then earlier this year Stephenson accepted a free stay in a luxury spa, worth £12,000, owned by a company which employed Wallis as a marketing advisor. Wallis also seems to have been [a friend of both Stephenson and John Yates](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/jul/16/paul-stephenson-drinks-neil-wallis), who conducted a review (which subsequently turned out not to be a review) into the initial investigation, which concluded that no further enquiries were necessary.

Putting the FT on is a bit misleading, as the type of news it reports is completely different to the others, and to assign a 'political' weighting to it is a bit disingenuous. I'd also say that the Statesman is more left-wing than the Guardian.

One other point I'd make is the visual impact of representing circulation in terms of size. In your diagram, size is represented by the two dimensions that already have values to them ('quality' and 'leaning'), and hence it can be misinterpreted to represent data about these two categories. A better, more commonly used representation of a third dimension in 2D graphs is colour (e.g. darker for higher circulation.)

But like I said, they're merely small points and the purpose of the diagram is fulfilled very well. Good job.

ignoring the horrific abuse of immigration law i know for a fact happens regularly by asians (mainly - obviously there are others but i know alot of indians and arabs esp, those with a bit of money) and the cheats they know and utilise to stay here on nothing....ignoring all of that, you also have cases of criminals, murders, bloody rapists even, managing to stay on the basis of the Right to a family life as laid out in both our own law, EU law and UN resolutions (under the banner of the UDHR). 
A case which is a couple of years old now is haunting me , an illegal who i think was zambian drinks a litre of whisky and drives....... he hits (and runs) and kills a 12 year old girl...
At court he gets convicted of drink driving but they couldn't prove (even though he was waaaaaay over the limit) that he was driving dangerously, no license, no insurance (doesn't that make him more dangerous?!) denied asylum 4 TIMES!! wasn't removed and he did this..... he was sentenced to 8 weeks in prison which was equal to time served on remand so he was freed essentially.... 
then manages to stay in the country (after everything he's done!) cos he marries some chav (but still lives with his sister) and his lawyer takes his case to the EU  and wins on the 'right to a family life'.... 

now i know this is long but what rages me is that a dick like that gets the luxury of staying here whilst being a complete cancer to our community, not improving our society in any fashion or contributing a share at all and he gets to stay....but this woman who has been through hell, who is legitimately married to a man she loves is being told it's all good and she'll most likely be accepted but that she has to go home at this most traumatic of times so she can apply from there.....at what point do you look and say a system is completely devoid of common sense, human integrity (lost to the God's of efficiency and austerity) and simply humanity......

*Yes, the Doctor's here. He came when I called, just like he always does. But not MY Doctor. Now my Doctor, I've seen whole armies turn and run away and he'd just swagger off back to his TARDIS and open the doors with a snap of his fingers. **The Doctor, in the TARDIS**, next stop everywhere.*

Doubt it's significant, but after watching Series 5 and rewatching the Library episodes, the line stood out more than it had before. There's been so much talk of two Doctors (Doctor Goo, River and Rory's discussion about ""two Doctors"", the jacketed Doctor slipping back through his own timestream) and even having two Amy's in Time &amp; Space, that either it's a BIG red herring or we're going to end up with two Doctors (again) conveniently in time for one of them to be shot by the astronaut.

EDIT: Something else I remembered about Prisoner Zero, from the same dialogue you're referring to.

*Doctor crashes through window*

Doctor: Am I late? No, three minutes to go. There's still time.

Prisoner Zero: Time for what, Time Lord?

As well as another comment made by Prisoner Zero: ""The Universe is cracked. The Pandorica will open. Silence will fall.""

So, we can assume that Prisoner Zero knew the Doctor was a Time Lord (Amy didn't know that during the 12 years Zero spent in her house), knew the TARDIS was going to explode, knew about the Pandorica, and knew about the Silence.

2)Your client will otherwise incriminate himself if he speaks eg if his account of events are not believable.

You can remain guilty but unless you can come up with a good reason for remaining silent, the jury will probably assume it is because you are guilty.

If for some reason you elected to not have a solicitor, you might get away with claiming you were confused and lacking legal advice felt it was the best course of action...the jury might believe it. That said, you are entitled to a solicitor so it is doubtful it would work as the police would tell you that inferences can be drawn from silence.",0,1310999104,null,0,false,0,c26crkn,t3_islhd,t1_c26crkn,t1_c26c3s3,1427361874,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

What that flag stands for is sovereignty of the U.S. During the civil war the south and Texas on it's own.

So when they fought the North, they really believed they were fighting for freedom of the Norths ""tierney."" 

They were stupid then and stupid now. 

Flash word to now, the South lost the war and so ever since the 1800's they've always been bitter about that. So in ""protest"" they still fly their confederate flag. As time went on they flag was forgotten, as was the south. Now in more modern times, say the 50's -60's they started flying their flag again. Except this time it was in rebellion towards segregation, of the south in particular. 

This is when the flags meaning took a turn and for the worst. The South now wanted to have the flag represent solidarity in keeping with white principles. So when they flew their flag it meant ""when you come to the south, you do things our way or else.""

Of course they lost that war as well, segregation that is. See a pattern? 

So flash forward again now to when the south is really dumber than it has ever been, the flag is flown willy nilly but now nobody knows why. They have no understanding of what the flag truly represents, just that it lets the world know ""fuck you, I'm from the south""

The technological gap that was opening with our allies was closed. Then they set up the process for the major spending review but weren't in power to see it through.

All they've done is reduce the major investments we needed to irrelevancies in order to cut a few pennies while ignoring the elephant in the room for the sake of traditionalist bullshit.

Lucas had to be our player of the season to get some recognition when watching a few of his performances should have been enough. Most casual football fans don't know that much about the sport, and most tabloid readers don't know much about anything, so they're easy to manipulate.

But I'm also not so sure if I'll immediately take a tabloid journalist's word as authoritative about what tabloid bosses are willing to do. 

No offense, I'm sure she's a very nice and smart person, but asking a tabloid journalist about what evil her industry might be able or willing to do is like asking a pro cyclist about whether you can still honestly win the Tour without doping (""of course you can, why would I be in this otherwise!""), or asking a famous footballer about whether there will be a horrible backlash against inflated footballer wages (""of course not, they love us!"").

OK, those are crap analogies. I don't do analogies very well, sorry. Not even sure how to spell them. But you get my point, maybe. 

It holds especially if she really thinks (see post below) that tabloid journalism was only bad in the 90s, but was fine before and has ""totally calmed down"" since. That kind of smacks like, I dunno, naivity maybe, or the kind of rationalizations that an insider whose job depends on the industry would say. Truth is, tabloids published horrid, scandalmongering, bigoted, mudslinging stuff without scruples in the 80s, in the 90s, and they still do. I'm glad there's less screaming and bullying inside their offices, makes for a more relaxed working environment for the cubicle workers, but their ""journalistic"" practices and output are still scummy across the board, as this whole phone hacking scandal once again reveals.

Well, he hasn't been really, not £20 million excellent anyway. He just got barged out of the way by any Premier League players that were marking him. 

Don't get me wrong though, based on his play against Malaysia XI he's the most technically gifted and exciting players I've seen in a Liverpool shirt in a long time. But to put that into perspective, it was the Malaysia XI.

Liverpool play Hull on July 23rd. That's where we'll get to see if he's improved in fitness and strength. Personally I'd absolutely love it if he became one of the heros of this season. It would be great for him to shake off the mantle of replacing Xabi Alonso.


***Edit for clarification:*** I reiterate that I like Aquilani a lot, his style of play and his attitude. Aquilani got a few man of the match awards in his first season. But he also started that season at the end of October due to injury and would usually be subbed either on or off and so could not impose himself as a regular in his position and was clearly not match fit. He didn't have a preseason and was expected to just magically turn into Xabi 2 having not played a game in months.

To answer the question; he was badly injured when he came to Anfield having cost a massive amount of money and wasn't fully fit until last season. These days I don't see much grief from the media towards Aquilani. Instead it's all aimed towards Torres who shares a lot of the same problems Aquilani had.

Here's another question:

&gt;Why does *Torres* get so much grief from the media when he's been excellent in nearly every appearance for *Chelsea*? 

&gt;I simply don't get it. He's a calming presence with a great touch. If pass-and-move football is the goal then he's a perfect player for it.

For sure. As with governments, you get the press you deserve, I suppose.

&gt; ( as she says ) the tide is definitely turning. Which can only be a good thing.

I can only hope she's right ...

&gt;What I do know is that the industry changed when journalists realised that they couldn't write what they wanted without having it backed up by a team of lawyers for liable. Everything is fed through a team of lawyers nowadays before being printed. So what you get nowadays, as scandalous as it may be, is fact... 

Reassuring, but one thing that makes me wonder about - maybe she has some insight on that too - is whether that's made the redtop press more cautious and factual across the board, or more specifically when it comes to reporting on the kind of famous/important/well-off people who'd be most likely to launch a libel suit?

[Here is one of the first landings back in the 60's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BRdFa1sswU&amp;feature=related)

[Here's one of my favorite modern scenes of the TARDIS in action](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8QJN2asrwM)  

If you're looking for more information, the TARDIS is The Doctor's (That's the name he goes by, as his real name is secret) Time/Space vehicle.  It is supposed to blend in by taking the shape of whatever object is most likely to go unnoticed in a particular setting.  It landed in Britain in the 60's and so took the shape of a police box, which was a common sight at the time. At some point though, the chameleon circuit, which makes this camouflage happen, broke, and so it has been stuck in the shape of a police box since. The Doctor fixed it once, but it disguised as a pipe organ among other things and since then it's always been a police box.  By now he has grown so fond of the shape that he doesn't really work on fixing it anymore.  

Over the course of the show, the Doctor has been played by 11 actors officially. Each time he is injured, he regenerates into a new face, and a somewhat changed personality, though he is still the same man.

However, you could pull Downing back to Adam's position, have Carroll in the central striker position and put Suarez out on the left. he has shown he can cut inside and pull apart any defense.  

I see Meireles, at least for the start of the season playing instead of Adam. He gels better with the current lineup and works very well with the pass and move style. 

Lucas is a definite, no one could take his place on the team away from him. Aquaman is an excellent player too.

The biggest game-changer with a story about time travel (and if you think about it , prophecy) is whether knowing the future changes it or not.  Hell, Charles Dickens has Scrooge begging for spoilers when he asks the Ghost of Christmas Future ""Are these the shadows of things that *will be*, or of things that *might be*, only?""  Marty McFly could change the future, but Sarah Connor couldn't stop Judgement Day. Scrooge changed his life after a glimpse of what was to come; Oedipus was less lucky.

Knowing if the future is fixed or not is the difference between a story about Fate, and a story about Free Will.  A tragedy or a comedy.  So which one is Doctor Who?

By being both a fate and free will story, the episodes can explore both, which is probably best for a TV show regarding a question that most philosophers have a tough time with.  Personally, I think the best time travel stories have to include both. To take Back to the Future as an example of a good time travel story, the past can be rewritten (Twin Pines Mall becomes Lone Pine Mall by the end of the movie, Biff becomes a gentle giant), but Marty also plays a role in new ""fixed events"" that have to happen, like his parents getting together.  His motivation for getting his parents together are in his own interest, however, he does need to fight against his parent's free will in order to set things right.  By the end of the movie, everything is resolved but there is no ultimate answer as to whether Marty was a tool of fate, or the other way around.

It's funny you bring up Terminator, because the end of T2 certainly does come down on the free will side (they stop Judgment Day), but then the movie studio wanted another movie, so they made T3, and claim that Judgement Day was ""only postponed"" which implies fate.  In terms of DW, the fact they consistently oscillate, in my view anyway, makes it a very good time travel story.

true,galith,null,null,"Sure.  So you remember the idea of dominant and recessive genes from school?  Well hair unlike eyes or skin color is controlled by only 1 gene, so it makes it simple.  Basically you have 3 different ways a person can be, let's just say umm

 Brown hair = Dominant, Also known as BB or Bb

Red Hair = Recessive, also known as bb

Therefore you can get a brown haired indivdual 3/4 of the time and a red haired individual 1/4 of the time if the two parents are both Bb and Bb.

So, a brown haired person could be BB (homozygous dominant) or Bb (heterozygous recessive), so a person with brown hair is still carrying that red haired 'b' gene, even though they don't show it.  Thus that little 'b' gene, will always get passed on at least to some children.  That's why you can have two people with brown hair give birth to a red-headed child.

This is what is referred to as Heterozygous shielding, the recessive gene gets shielded from being taken out of the gene pool.  On the opposite effect, a dominant trait can be taken out of the gene pool.  

Thus, while the amount of blonde/red hair people may decrease slightly.  They will never disappear.  You can read more here.

I'm saying that they're better at one thing than the other, not that they are shit at it by any means.  Aquilani and Lucas lend their own touch to the center in being a more calming influence compared to the quick hollywood ball style of Gerrard and Adam but all four often rotate around the midfield seamlessly.

true,rykell,null,null,"&gt;Well, he hasn't been really, not £20 million excellent anyway. He just got barged out of the way by any Premier League players that were marking him.

That isn't true in the slightest (not to mention he's 6-1).  Obviously there is some differences in the officiating between Italy and England but Aquilani looked excellent in every appearance I can remember.

As far as the £20 million number, there have been a lot of expensive purchases that never lived up to their transfer fee but people are judging Aquilani on a half season when he was still getting fit from a couple injuries.  It's ludicrous. 

&gt;Don't get me wrong though, based on his play against Malaysia XI he's the most technically gifted and exciting players I've seen in a Liverpool shirt in a long time. But to put that into perspective, it was the Malaysia XI.

He looked good against GSRFC (awesome acronym) too, not to mention the games he was in at Juventus and the games when he was fit for Liverpool (as you've stated with the MOTM headlines).

&gt;Here's another question:

The problem with that is as a CF it's a striker's job to score and Torres couldn't do that.  It's Aquilani's job to pass and set up players which he did to great effect.",0,1311049650,null,0,false,0,c26ift4,t3_it5ri,t1_c26ift4,t1_c26g022,1427364616,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Oh, the show came three years before Doctor Who came back, so it's not so hard to see where our River came from. Only difference is that Tam is a mentally unstable teenage girl, whilst Song is a cougar with a gun ;)

Life on Mars is another great show, sort of sci-fi, sort of drama, and it's got John Simms in it, so if you liked him (Either as a suave politician, or a hot blond in a dog collar, as you do), you'll like this.

Then again, there's good old Torchwood/Sarah Jane Adventures. If you want some in-Whoniverse action, this is definitely a good stop. And both Ten and Eleven show up in Sarah Jane Adventures, so you don't even miss the Doctor. And [Martha Jones shows up in Torchwood](/spoiler), so there you go :)

A third recommendation is that you watch Alphas? An american sci-fi show that's only just started, so you can follow it whilst you're waiting.

Johnson......Carra.......Agger..........Aurelio

   Aquilani/Merieles.....Lucas.....Gerrard

  Kuyt/Downing.... Carroll/Kuyt.... Suarez

I'm not sure how to keep Aquilani, Adam, Merieles and Henderson in the same team though. I think one of Aquilani or Merieles will have to be sold which is unfortunate because I like both of them. It's just that we have essentially 5 players for 2 spots, and one of those spots is occupied by the captain who won't miss any important matches if he doesn't have to. I'm betting it's Merieles who will wind up getting sold.

The team is also built around Carroll. Playing Suarez as a false 9 as you're suggesting may seem attractive but keep in mind that as many good CM we have, none of them are close to Xavi and Iniesta and Suarez is not close to Messi. We'll pass the ball around a lot, but the plan A is going to be to hit the ball to the 6'3"" guy in the middle. You don't buy Charlie Adam and Stewart Downing without that in mind.

And the bench suddenly looks VERY deep. In this team there would be Doni, Skyrtl, Kelly, Adam, Henderson, Kuyt, Merieles...

Probably too many players right now but it's nice that we have that problem instead of in years past when there was nothing on the bench to change a game.
