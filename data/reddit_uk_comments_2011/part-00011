As most of my friends live (or have lived) in the montpelier / st. pauls / easton area and are filthy hippies, the topic of socialism vs. anarchism often comes up and I make no bones about my anarchist sympathies. It has been interesting to see the interplay of that argument and the reactions to the role of junkies / the lumpen-proletariat within a movement. However, I am not sure you would qualify, in my interpretation, as a member of the 'lumpen-proletariat,' given that your attributes, as described, do not seem to fall under the purview of the overall idea of the lumpen-proletariat as a faction unable to achieve class consciousness by virtue of the fact that they prey remorselessly on members of their own class: ""The lumpen lives off the proletariat, which serves as the primary prey for its thievery and a market for its illicit trade.""

Secondly, 'illegitimate' and 'illicit' are charged terms that are, essentially, meaningless - and if every 'legitimate' trade strengthens the system against which you fight, are not underground, illicit, illegitimate means of surviving a valid tactic (insofar as the movement remains ethically consistent with its own values)?

That's not to say that nuclear power doesn't have its problems (some fairly serious ones at that).  But rational thought and careful examination of the relative merits of different energy sources took a back seat to the emotional (and often illogical) response from anti-nuclear campaigners.

So the well-meaning (but often misguided) folk who said ""No to Nuclear!"" inadvertently helped to maintain our reliance on fossil fuels.

Just in case I sound like a spokesman for the nuclear industry (which I am most definitely not), I should also point out that it has been suggested that in the 1980s BNFL were ""influential"" in having the government cut  funding for alternative energy research.  The fact that BNFL also manufacture weapons grade plutonium for the country's nuclear weapons arsenal tends to give them a lot of clout.

We own the banks... It's not 'the banks money' its our, public, shareholding.

I'm not claiming it is a creation of money, I'm saying that it's money the government should be using to protect services, not handing to everyone willy nilly.

I'm a small business owner and the biggest bureaucratic burden on me comes from HMRC (PAYE, NI, VAT, etc).  But somehow I don't imagine that a radical reform of tax law is what Cameron's got in mind.  Anything short of that isn't going to make much difference to me. 

&gt; ""The town hall officials who take for ever with those planning decisions that can be make or break for a business – and the investment and jobs that go with it.""

There aren't many small business that need to worry about planning issues (that I can think of at least).  Big industry, yes.  Property developers, yes.  Airport developers, yes.  Small businesses, no.

&gt; ""The public sector procurement managers who think that the answer to everything is a big contract with a big business and who shut out millions of Britain's small- and medium-sized companies from a massive potential market.""

Well that would be nice, but I'll believe it when I see it.  The reason that big companies win big bids is because they can afford to throw lots of money into winning that business.  They can make generous donations to political parties, attend lots of trade shows (including some closed ones), entertain potential clients, advertise in management journals, and so on, and so on. I don't think any of that is going to change just because Cameron says so.

It's all the usual political spin.  We're going to do this, and that, without actually explaining how we're going to do it.

Here's an article by someone who had a premature baby. It's a bit long and waffley but I found it very moving. The TL;DR is that premature babies may or may not survive but almost always suffer extreme disabilities. This woman's baby died shortly after birth.

In most cases I think extremely premature babies are caused by women getting pregnant when they absolutely should not be.

With cold hard cash, usually 10% and up to 30% for excellent service. I'll also tip extra if I stayed after their normal closing time.

If there is a problem with the food I'll make it known right away and as long as they fix it they'll still get a good tip of course. If there is a problem with the service they might end up with nothing. 

&gt; Do you ever tip if you've paid a service charge? 

Yes, if the service was good I'll still put down money for a tip or if I'm paying for the group I'll ask the guests to put money down for the tip.

&gt; How likely are the wait staff to actually see any of that service charge?

I guess all the restaurants will have different policies, my general assumption is that the staff do see some of it at least. The only evidence I have of that is one of my friends who worked in restaurants for a couple of years and she always paid her bills with her salary and used the tips for partying, travelling and other fun stuff.

Of course, but cash back into the treasury, not cash to dole out to people at random.

&gt;The Tories used the financial crisis to implement ideological changes that involved cutting public services. 

Absolutely.

&gt; Once these shares get up to a decent price (they will, and many people knew they would once the Govt stepped in to save the banks) the money raised will not go towered replacing services which were cut but will fund tax cuts, unless of course the money is only realised after a GE where Labour are elected. Given that the Tories will run on a platform of tax cuts paid for by these shares I don't see that happening next time around.

Which still doesn't mean that handing it out to people willy nilly is a good or prudent thing to do.  I don't trust the Tories as far as I could thrown them, but I also get the impression that this is a bit of a stunt and will be harmful in the medium and long term

Even if this plan gets the go ahead (it won't) no one will get 1000 pounds worth of shares. Rather, you are given any profit made on £1000 of shares. The proposal suggests (I would say compels) that you cannot sell your £1000 worth until the value is at least £1000. At that point, the £1000 goes back to the treasury and you would get to keep the profit. And just the profit, not £1000 + the profit. 

The reason for exploring this is fairly simple. The government is going to find it rather difficult to make it's money back through a conventional share sale as the market knows exactly what they paid, and exactly how much they own. This creates an information imbalance in the market and gives other traders an edge. By distributing nominal ownership (shall we call it responsibility rather than ownership?) they stagger the sale of the shares, prevent devaluing shares by flooding the market and introduce some much needed uncertainty - I'm sure some would sell their shares immediately, some after the initial trench and others much later. If they went for a standard share issue, the shares would lose value - supply vs demand and basic economics.

Well, speaking as a worker, I have to say that you're making a very simple thing in to a scary thing!

'Business' is not some monolithic organisation. Business is human interaction involving money.Those 'shady backroom deals' - trust me, they're alot less shady looking when you're actually there (and you probably will be one day). 

People like to talk with people they know, people who their friends recommend or who share their interests, and it's exactly the same in business. That's precisely how some people who really should be at the bottom end up at the top - they recognised that a charming manner and a winning attitude can go very, very far.

&gt; By no means... (snip) ...produces this outcome.

Sorry but there is alot of language here that is overly political. You cannot understand business in political terms and it will never be explained in political terms.

&gt; For me policy tweaks will do nothing, and instead there need a radical overhaul of the economic and organisational tools that we have: what money fundamentally is, how our 'democracy' has been implemented, what legal frameworks are in place.

Oh, you *merely* want drastic reform of our economy, our system of government and our legal system? :P

Seriously though, you're asking everybody to uproot our entire civilisation just to satisfy your sense of alienation.

I will say this for your question about *what money fundamentally is*.

Money is the representation of value. This is a fundamental truth. Don't forget - anything can be money because value is defined by consensus. When a Government interferes, it destroys this consensus because value is now defined by a third party.

Giving the shares away would lead to a massive intergenerational transfer of wealth to the wealthier, older generation. It would be regressive. Everyone alive presently will get the windfall benefits of those shares, whilst the younger generation (age &lt; 35) would be left to pay the national debt (which was substantially increased due to the government having inject capital into the banks). 

The current path is a much better option and it's thinking is as following. As the balance sheets of the banks begin to improve, so will their share prices. It sounds crazy but eventually, those shares prices will improve so much that the government will have made a profit on it and it will sell those shares to private investors. The government will use these profits for new infrastructure projects or tax cuts, which will benefit everyone.

If you notice the only people who were left in the virtual world, were all of River's friends who all died at the hands of the Vashta Narada. Their consciousness was saved by the computer, but their bodies were mostly destroyed so the computer can't put their consciousness back into a skeleton or corpse. River's body, although not shown, was probably burned or fried when she connected herself to the computer. It doesn't show it obviously, as that would be too grotesque for a kid's show, but I think it's insinuated. I think the only way the Doctor could get around that would be to go back to the Library with a perfect physical android replica of River and then figure out a way to stick her consciousness into the android.

The second link is a little more annoying to get to - they have dumb advertisements, but with ad block it's not that bad. It also has megavideo.

1. The police service does not currently have the right to strike.

3. Crime rates (there are exceptions in individual categories such as knife crime) are at [historic lows.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jan/21/police-figures-unexpected-drop-crime)

The police service is not perfect. There are serious issues, such as overtime payments, which need to be addressed. However, police officers are public servants like any other doing a difficult job imperfectly. They already face a 2 year pay freeze as inflation spirals. 

While their role as state enforcers in recent anti-cuts protests naturally leads to a less than sympathetic response; this impulse should be guarded against as it is little more than knee-jerk bitterness.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Business is intrinsically political, but this seems an issue of semantics; for me everything is political, from friendships to states. Topical shady backroom deals include Andrew Windsor, or the various other Libya related scandals; that is what I talk about. On the smaller scale, there is the planned development that already was always going to get approval despite the communities wishes. Further to this ignorance to how deals are made (ACTA a great example) there is a greater mystery regarding the fundamentals of economics and monetary theory. Most would not be able to articulate well quite what those funny papers and coins actually mean.

The sense of alienation is a reality. People have little say in the development of their own communities, business seems to happen from outside in, and top down. Likewise the profits have a similar pattern, but the inverse. Movements like UKUncut is indicative of alienation as a whole, it certainly is not my personal stance, but a wider national affliction. People vote but see no real change. The reality is that the average person and smaller businesses has seen their income, or rather purchasing power, stagnate or decline since the 70s. The rich, even over the last years of 'hardship' have gotten richer. On a wider scale, in every emerging economy, you have obscene wealth and poverty - russian billionaires can be compared to the rampant sex trade, indian billionaires and starving farmers, egyptian... you get the point. We have to ask ourselves why is this, is it all inevitable? I think we can skip the question of whether or not this is a desirable state.

I think I know what is the problem, the means of commerce - money. As for what money is, surely this is a tool that acts on a societal level and is representative of debt, not value? An abstraction of debt that enables multidirectional asynchronous commerce. If you are in debt you owe society, if you have money you need to spend it lest those indebted are unable to settle their debt.

Most won't even realise that the pound and institutions like the Bank of England were created to serve a monarchy - and of course these are artificial constructs and entities. The design will have a bias. The single currency suppressed the rising middle classes, and the Bank of England was a private institution from the beginning:

&gt; in 1694 a private institution, the Bank of England, was set up to supply money to the King. £1.2m was raised in 12 days; half of this was used to rebuild the Navy. [wikipedia]

And today it still has independence on monetary policy, thus the economy is fundamentally privately run. There has been an annex of the tools of business from the democratic process. For me it is not surprising that a tool designed to concentrate wealth from the beginning, still does so today. The business tools we have is what needs to change, or at least the development of alternatives. It is getting quite lengthy so I'll rattle off some points:

* remove systemic interest rates
* introduce a transparent currency (all transactions are public as are accounts)
* introduce alternative currencies, local maybe, ideally a personal one
* remove copyright laws and patents (I know a little of topic, but again these have monarchist origins as do...)
* laws surrounding companies and any other rentier structures need addressing

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Business is intrinsically political, but this seems an issue of semantics; for me everything is political, from friendships to states.

It is semantics. And sorry, but I'd hate to be your friend if you're only friends with me for political reasons.

&gt; Topical shady backroom deals include Andrew Windsor, or the various other Libya related scandals; that is what I talk about.

None of which has anything to do with business. Not really. That is international diplomacy and international politics. Cut throat indeed, but hardly the measure of the world.

&gt; The sense of alienation is a reality.

Sorry, but I don't feel alienated. I would suggest that the sense of alienation is your own personal issue, and not really worth destroying civilisation over.

&gt; Business seems to happen from outside in, and top down. Likewise the profits have a similar pattern, but the inverse.

Well, duh!

Why would you gamble your home, your future, your family or marriage to start a business if you didn't have control over how the business was run? Why would you invest your time and money if you knew that any profit would immediately be taken from you by some council-appointed busybody who doesn't have a clue about the sacrifices you've made?

&gt; As for what money is, surely this is a tool that acts on a societal level and is representative of debt, not value? An abstraction of debt that enables multidirectional asynchronous commerce.

Wrong. You're thinking of credit, which is worlds apart from Money, and which was the lynchpin of Labours 'boom years'. 

&gt; If you are in debt you owe society, if you have money you need to spend it lest those indebted are unable to settle their debt.

Again, wrong. If your are in debt, you owe your creditors, not some nebulous monolith called ""society"".

&gt; Most won't even realise that the pound and institutions like the Bank of England were created to serve a monarchy

And thrice wrong! The BoE was created in 1694, around forty years after the English Civil War that placed Parliament firmly in the driving seat of English politics.

It was founded after a man called William Paterson proposed a loan of £1,200,000 to the Government *(note Government, not the King)*. In return the subscribers would be incorporated as the Governor and Company of the Bank of England.

&gt; And today it still has independence on monetary policy, thus the economy is fundamentally privately run.

The independence on monetary policy was [issued by Gordon Brown.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/6/newsid_3806000/3806313.stm).

&gt; remove systemic interest rates

To do so would effectively wipe out the lending/borrowing system. Why would anyone lend you any significant amount of money without some hope of a return? 

&gt; introduce a transparent currency (all transactions are public as are accounts)

Why should I tell the Government what I'm buying and how much for? What on earth would that do for anyone? Pointless.

&gt; introduce alternative currencies, local maybe, ideally a personal one

A return to barter, eh? It's good if your local area has all the resources you need, but what happens when you want to buy imported Jeans from the USA? Are you going to offer them fifty *Clacton-upon-Sea Pounds*?

&gt; remove copyright laws and patents

Monarchist origins my bollocks, you'd remove any chance of inventors and innovators from profiting from their own work? Nice.  

&gt; laws surrounding companies and any other rentier structures need addressing

What does this even mean?

&gt; Remember anything cannot be money, there are laws against that sort of thing.

Your final point, [and it's wrong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_money), just like pretty much every other point you've made in your post.

true,[deleted],null,null,"This isn't a regular QI episode. This week there was a charity event called 24 Hour Panel People, where David Walliams (the 'thick contestant' in this video) competed in panel games for 24 hours straight on live TV. That's why the set looked strange, it wasn't the normal QI stage, it was a special one for this event. They'll be back in the regular studio when the next season starts.

An XL edition is the same as the regular episode, but it includes five to twenty minutes of footage that was cut for time on the original broadcast. They usually air a week after the original episode, but sometimes they only come out a year later. They only started making XL editions after Episode 64 (""Flotsam &amp; Jetsam"", 2009), no episode before that has one.

Because the XL editions air much later in the night than the regular ones do, any jokes that are considered offensive or risque tend to be cut from the regular edition and restored to the XL one.

QI is not normally broadcast live, this is the only time it's ever happened. The seasons are recorded, edited, and broadcast days or weeks after their recording, usually in September to January.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; It is semantics. And sorry, but I'd hate to be your friend if you're only friends with me for political reasons.

It doesn't bode well when the first point is an ad hominem. I guess that must mean friendships and communities are born out of a love for your fellow man and bunnies. On a fundamental level it is all about protection and resource management; the survival of the most cooperative. Thus from who one invites for tea, to the wedding, the suit you where to court, to councilors and the people, any point of human interaction is political, it is all about managing relationships and perception. I am talking about politics in the broadest sense.

&gt; That is international diplomacy and international politics. Cut throat indeed, but hardly the measure of the world.

If you have even had a cursory glance at any of the recent leaks, it seems diplomacy is a euphemism for closed door business practices and international coercion: the US state department, Mosanto and GM crops; Libya and the release of the prisoner for oil contracts; Andrew Windsor and many more. It's hardly of the people, by the people. It is almost solely a business endeavour.

&gt; I would suggest that the sense of alienation is your own personal issue, and not really worth destroying civilisation over.

Onto the strawmen, I never said anything about destroying civilisation, just freeing it from the biases designed into the system hundreds of years ago. If you don't yet believe that there is a national sense of alienation check the TUC marches later this month I think.

&gt; Why would you gamble your home, ... busybody who doesn't have a clue about the sacrifices you've made?

Again, I haven't said anything about some 'busybody' taking profits. I illude to the ability of big business to come into an area and suck money out. This happens locally: a new tescos; nationally: financial services sucking wealth south; and (quasi) internationally: where wealth is sucked through various artificial business structures to tax havens or other countries.

Obscene profit, or just profit, is not the only incentive. For the most noble it is often the endeavour itself which is its own reward. Innovation had managed to happen without such modern trappings like the [Satute of Monopolies (1623)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Monopolies_1623), the first statutory expression of English patent law. If you look at its history, it is one of rampant abuse: Elizabeth I used it as a stealth tax on common items like starch and salt. Her successors were perhaps worse.

&gt; Wrong. You're thinking of credit.

I didn't explain myself perhaps, but I am not thinking of credit. Money has its origins in personal debt; clay receipts for produce brought to food stores that were then passed round the proto-economy as a means of money, is a good example. Others include knots in ropes, and shells. At some point the one to one relationship of debt becomes a many-to-many, and money can do its job, improve commerce. That's what I mean when I say a multidirectional asynchronous form of trading. Bartering would be one-to-one and synchronous, debt and the resolution happens within the same instance. Debt is intrinsic to such a system though, and thus I insist that if there is money in abstract form, there must be someone who owes the economy, or owes society. Further [musings on money can be found in another post](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fwlqj/the_corporation_a_documentary_dissecting_the/c1j96fb). I try and sketch the details of how an alternative currency could be fundamentally different, and have positive side effects.

&gt; BoE

The details may have been wrong, but the general idea of it being a largely private endeavour from inception I think holds true. The economy is managed in monarchist form; top down, rather than being a product of the people, say the sum of all economic activity. I am confident that it is right to say that the economy is managed in 'the other place'. Indeed Gordon Brown making it independent hints at the status quo being afraid of what a democracy could do with it. Again there is a certain artificial nature and privatisation of control.

&gt; Interest rates.

Issuing currency mostly takes the form of private banks lending money into existence, but at interest (and of course there is the con of the fractional reserve). So should say £100 be in this hypothetical economy, where exactly does the money come from to cover the interest? Ah yes, the ever increasingly hyperbolic graphs detailing the debt crisis. To pay the interest, borrow more and hope for eternal growth. Like was society is stratified, the rich get a percentage richer per year, and the poor get a percentage further into poverty. It is no coincidence that across nearly all previous civilisations usury was repugnant. For the heated differences between Islam and Christians, originally, this was a rare point of agreement. (I am no way implying blame the Jews.........)

&gt; Transparent currency

One of the ills of the crisis was banks could not lend to other banks, as it was not clear who had completely corrupted themselves. If you followed my earlier link to an alternate post, then you will have read in more detail about the positives of transparency. I think there is much to say here.

&gt; Local currencies, personal currency.

Again not a return to barter (is that like the third straw man?). Personal currencies can be pooled into local urban currencies, into regional currencies, national then international. It is technically possible given electronic currency, but I think money has to be designed in a particular way. Also notice I said **currencies**; there is no reason why you can't have multiple forms of legal tender.

&gt; Monarchist origins my bollocks.

Copyright does exactly the opposite of what you think, as a programmer the biggest headache is the patent troll. Ask any that haven't donned a suit, and they will say that it curbs innovation; smaller start ups cannot afford the legal teams necessary to ward off attacks or pursue defensive patents themselves. The fashion industry doesn't actually allow patents nor copyright, but I doubt anyone would claim that it has stifled innovation. Don't forget, there is a reason why it is called royalties. From inception, copyright has been used to limit innovation and exert monopoly control: ['copyright law in most European countries lies in efforts by the church and governments to regulate and control printing', 'in pre-revolutionary France all books needed to be approved by official censors and authors and publishers had to obtain a royal privilege before a book could be published'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright#Early_European_printers.27_monopoly). In France today, there is a tax on writable CDs. The proceeds go to the 'creative industries' that have decided by themselves, that the innovation of W-CDs has impacted them negatively.

&gt; laws surrounding companies and any other rentier structures need addressing

I've mentioned offshoring and tax evasion, but I am hinting at the origins of the corporation, and such contrivances as [the Royal Charter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Charter). History is agreed here, the first corporations were state/monarchy sanctioned monopolies, to go with their monopoly currencies; a great example would be East India Trading Co (incidentally it deployed the states military to open up new markets where markets were not being compliant (doesn't that ring a modern middle-eastern bell?)). So it seems that the corporation, having its origins in legalese and political influence using a money designed for scarcity, if it goes unchanged then history will inevitably repeat - environmental degradation, social unrest, military actions, etc.

&gt; Subscribing to conspiracy theories...

Talking of cycles, we are back at the start: ad hominem, you may as well call me a heretic while you are at it. At least you didn't call me an economic terrorist and have me disappeared to gitmo. And I am right, the only legal tender is what the state says is legal tender. Yes, it can manifest in coin, paper or electronics, but what is **legal** is strictly under state control.

**Edit:** One thing that I haven't addressed is the relevance to the small business. The higher level business dealings very much decide what capital will 'trickle' down. And of course that never happens. Or it does and the business is encouraged towards the pursuit of ever ending growth and expansion, then monopoly. Obviously not all reach monopoly status, but a few, or even one, will for each sector.

Guh. That's why I said ""possible"" - it's very difficult for them to actually fine people, because they can't prove who personally refused to fill it in.

&gt;Firstly, The government have an appalling track record when it comes to data protection

Did you read what I said? It has nothing to do with the Government - if you mean civil servants have a poor record, then sure. But you give out your details on a regular basis - anything could go wrong at any time. There's always online if you don't trust the postal service.

&gt;Secondly the data is being processed by an American corporation, namely Lockheed Martin. Why should the private details of every household in the UK be processed by an American company?

It's hardly Us v. Them, it's not as if America are our enemies. Sure, there are nationalistic interests to be considered, but I would recommend writing to your MP about them to complain.

&gt;And finally, a census should be nothing more than a population count, the res of the details they want are, frankly, none of the governments damn business!

Like what? Your age? Whether or not you're employed? Your religion? All of those have an impact on the funding of services in your local area. If the county councils have an idea of areas with a high concentration of unemployment then they can do something about it.

If you want to think less selfishly, then there's also future generations to consider. People who want to find out what their ancestors got up to. That's why earlier censuses and the Domesday Book are so valuable.

In honesty, I just want a degree because I'm finding moving from a technical role into a management role to be harder than I'd like. I'm in my mid-30s now, and I've done very well in my technical career, but I figure that has a limited life span.

The reason for wanting an MBA was mainly because it would be mostly free, and also well supported with study leave, time, etc. It's also a fairly tough 2 year haul, but you can be done in 2 years.

With the OU, I was looking at a minimum of 4 years to a degree, and more likely 5-6 given their skewed assignment allocation. 

I'm near UEL, but I looked at a couple of their part time courses, and everything I looked at had week-day commitment requirements, and I can't do weekdays between 07:30 and 17:30, so that blew them out of the water.

No you didn't - but then you also seem to consider that the process of ""freeing it from the biases designed into the system hundreds of years ago"" would not be a destructive process. In order to achieve these objectives, you have to destroy what already exists.

You should think through the consequences of what you advocate before accusing me of 'strawman attacks'.

&gt; Again, I haven't said anything about some 'busybody' taking profits. I illude to the ability of big business to come into an area and suck money out.

Well as we started out discussing **small business** I erroneously believed that's what you were referring to. Forgive me for not being aware that you were now talking about Monsanto!

&gt; I didn't explain myself perhaps, but I am not thinking of credit. Money has its origins in personal debt; clay receipts for produce brought to food stores that were then passed round the proto-economy as a means of money, is a good example.

No, you did explain yourself, and you're still talking about credit. Since you obviously didnt read the link to the history of money, here's the dictionary definition:

[Money: something generally accepted as a medium of exchange, a measure of value, or a means of payment](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/money)

And here's the relevant definition of credit:

[Credit: the provision of money, goods, or services with the expectation of future payment.](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/credit)

&gt; The details may have been wrong, but the general idea of it being a largely private endeavour from inception I think holds true. The economy is managed in monarchist form; top down, rather than being a product of the people, say the sum of all economic activity.

Right, so you believe that in order to stop ""top down control"" of the economy, then the Government needs to step in and control it from the top down in the name of the people?

Personally I believe there should be no Government interference *at all*. That really would be an economy of the people, for the people and by the people.

&gt; Statute of Monopolies (1623)

You have misunderstood that edict. The statute of monopolies is the issuing of government sanctioned monopolies by the Monarch - not regulation against it. It really has no relevance in this discussion.

&gt; One of the ills of the crisis was banks could not lend to other banks, as it was not clear who had completely corrupted themselves. If you followed my earlier link to an alternate post, then you will have read in more detail about the positives of transparency.

I did not see this link and really the onus is not on me to search your post history to see what you're talking about. If it's relevent, then post it.

&gt; Again not a return to barter (is that like the third straw man?). Personal currencies can be pooled into local urban currencies, into regional currencies, national then international.

...and another straw man accusation!

If you had the slightest inkling of economics, you'd know that decentralised currency is essentially a return to barter. I like how you also completely ignored my question - if you want to import jeans, for example, why exactly should your clients accept your *own personal currency*?

This touches on the consensual value of money - another fundamental truth that you have chosen to ignore.

&gt; Also notice I said currencies; there is no reason why you can't have multiple forms of legal tender.

True, but they all have to be worth something. I can offer you three seashells and tell you they're worth three pounds - but that won't be true unless you agree. Value = consensus.

&gt; Copyright does exactly the opposite of what you think, as a programmer the biggest headache is the patent troll.

Yes, believe me I'm well aware of patent trolling :)

However, patent trolling is really a product of Intellectual Property law as well as poorly informed judges and politicians, most of whom have allowed monopolies to flourish throughout the digital industries because they weren't clued up enough to spot them. /rant

&gt; a great example would be East India Trading Co (incidentally it deployed the states military to open up new markets where markets were not being compliant

Well, the EIC had a long history, and you've overlooked the fact that it didn't start out that way. 

It initially operated entirely as a private entity and it was very much a product of its time. It was only later, during the height of the British imperial period, that the States interests became intertwined with those of the EIC - because by that point, the EIC was generating huge amounts of money. It's the original company that was too big to fail!

Even so, every company is not the East India Company. And every shopkeeper is not a Viceroy-in-waiting, so lets keep the hyperbolic comparisons to a minimum, eh?

&gt; Talking of cycles, we are back at the start: ad hominem, you may as well call me a heretic while you are at it. At least you didn't call me an economic terrorist and have me disappeared to gitmo

Hahaha, ad hominems indeed!

I made the point because you seems to have a very adversarial attitude towards business. 

In fact, the only reason I even initially responded to you was because you seemed to have a very dark and foreboding sense of what business entails. My point was that it needn't be scary, in fact it's very easy to understand and do well in the business world. 

Instead, I've found myself dragged in to a debate with someone who is clearly not interested in the truth, instead accusing me of 'ad hominem' attacks and 'strawman' arguments when I have attempted to correct your (at times wildly innaccurate) preconceptions.

If you want to carry on this debate, then I'm happy to do so, but please accept that debate means that we're essentially going to disagree about *everything* :)

Oh I bet it is. Read my post again. More bitchiness which isn't needed.

&gt;The 'Yes' side was the most honest by far. 

Honest? By far? ""Vote Yes for Wales"". 

&gt;What has led you to these assumptions about an ignorant Welsh public?

A few of my peers voted 'yes' - and when asked why - they responded with, ""there were posters around saying to vote yes"". On Facebook a few people admitted that they voted yes despite not really knowing what they were voting for. I am born in Wales and I live there, but that is totally not the point. 
Making assumptions that someone's place of origin determines their opinions is ridiculous. Or what you did was to make a silly assumption that one's opinions indicated their country of origin. That's also incredibly stupid. 

&gt; You'd fit in well.

Can you see what I mean by your bitchy tone? And really? A personal insult during a discussion? I can already tell that you belong in the YouTube comment boxes.

You previously mentioned that Wales is becoming less isolated. Devolution would mean that Wales would become more isolated since it severs ties with the United Kingdom, so I'm not really sure what you are on about here.

This is hilarious. 

I actually have an education in finance, so I know what I'm talking about and I know when someone is attempting to counter solid points with inaccuracies - for example, consistent attempts to equate money with credit!

There's more risible content in your post, but as you stated you'd like to put that aside, so as a sign of goodwill I will do so.

Regarding your other post, the first thing I notice is that you've equated money with credit (AAAARRRGHHHH!!!). Please, please learn what the correct definitions are. You'll only undermine your own arguments by using the wrong terminology.

For example, an ""asynchronous transaction"" is a process where a product or service is given in exchange for *deferred payment* - hence the word asynchronous (trans. 'not at the same time') - and the mechanism by which this works is credit. Not money, **credit**.

Now on to the content you linked to -

What you've written here is actually a fairly solid polemic against the credit system that resulted in the sale and acquisition of toxic assets.

Now believe it or not, you're not the first person to make these kind of arguments, so I'm going to use the terms used by those who came first. For example, your argument about using a pre-defined value of currency is generally termed as the Gold Standard.

&gt; those creating the debt in another, should have a realistic belief in the ability for the indebted to repay this debt

This is how things tradionally are. The system that enabled the kind of debt slavery that we saw in the Noughties is the same system that collapsed in 2008. 

It's not coming back - not if the Tories have any say about it - and it's these kind of reforms that Labour have decried as 'ideological cuts'.

Damn right they're ideological! And it's about time!

In fact much of your point aligns greatly with what is often termed 'Libertarianism'. 

Regarding your proposal of 'transparent trade', you forget that banks have been recording every transaction since the dawn of banking. No one keeps records like a bank does!

The only way you could enforce this total transparency would be to have one single central bank, which would be even worse than the many banks we have now. And personally, I don't want people knowing how much money I have in my account and what I've spent it on. So I'm not sure what you think the benefits of a 'transparent economy' would be...

&gt; Communites can more readily pool funds, and taxation would also be public knowledge.

I had a look at some photos of Mr Hester. Gordon brown is 5'10"" , and Mr Hester looks to easily be 6' . I would also argue he is more of a heavy frame but not too stocky. I would estimate conservatively at 82 kilograms looking at ideal body weight charts. Today's gold price is  roughly what it was yesterday, some fluctuations with some trading sites saying up, some down. So we will keep the price of gold per kilo at £28,330.

 28,330 times 82 equals 2,323,060.

At £2,323,060, Mr Hester is roughly equivalent value to Bob Diamond by clearly being a bargain with a worth more than 3 times his weight in gold.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; this idea of credit and money

Money itself is not the abstraction. Money is a representation of wealth, and always comprises something that both the buyer and the seller think has value. This is why Gold was the first real global currency.

It doesn't have to be gold though. It can be anything - a good example of this is cigarettes in prison, because although they have access to legitimate money, there's nothing to buy with it so people trade in smokes.

&gt; The ability of deferred payment is only made possible by having some abstraction to represent the debt, i.e. a form of money.

There is, and this is where Credit comes in. Credit is the abstraction. It is the promise of future payment.

Imagine going to a shop, you buy something for £10 but instead of paying in cash, you hand over an IOU. That IOU is a credit payment.

Now the shopkeeper can put the IOU in his bank, and the bank will accept it. The reason it'll do this is because you are known to be good for it - they know you'll pay that £10 back, and because of that assurance it's effectively the same as having £10 in their hand.

Now the shopkeeper could also take the IOU to another shop and buy something for £10, but instead of paying cash, he hands over your IOU. Shopkeeper 2 accepts it because, like the bank, he knows you're good for it. So now, instead of owing Shopkeeper 1 money, you owe it to Shopkeeper 2.

I hope this makes sense so far because this is where we start to get complicated.

When you buy a house and get a mortgage, the bank is technically witing out an IOU for £250,000 or whatever the house price is on your behalf. Now because it's such a large amount of money, the bank needs extra assurance of repayment, which is why we enter in to mortgage repayment schemes. 

So far so good. However, when we write out the IOU, we effectively create £250,000 worth of *credit*, created from nothing and backed by nothing except the assurance of future payment. This is how credit creates wealth and it's essentially a house of cards held up by promises.

This is how the banking crisis happened. The bankers got greedy, they realised that they could essentially make money from nothing by lending credit, and they stopped caring about the assurances of repayment. So they started lending to *anyone*, any Joe off the street with an easy smile and an outstretched hand, regardless of whether or not they could actually repay what they were borrowing.

These credit loans with a low expectation of repayment are called toxic assets. This might have been fine - it would have been dooming huge numbers of people to a lifetime of debt slavery, but it might have stood indefinitely except for one thing, and that was the US housing bubble. People were writing IOUs that they couldnt afford, for houses that weren't worth the price. Whent the debt went unpaid, the bank couldn't do anything except seize the house, and most of the time, it would be an unfinished McMansion in the desert outside Fresno, or something like that. 

Eventually the inevitable happened, a bank was forced in to a position where it had to call in all those IOUs. Oh fuck! No one was in a position to repay because all anyone had was a fistful of IOUs. Pretty soon the whole house of cards started to collapse. Lehman Brothers, Northern Rock, IceSave. Many banks, right around the world.

It should never be allowed to happen again. The credit system has its uses, but it should never have become the 'get rich quick' scheme that it became, and frankly, I think the banks that risked everything and lost, should have been allowed to fail.

Instead they got bailed out by the people at the bottom, an seem to be going [right back to how they were operating before](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/feb/28/northern-rock-offer-90-per-cent-mortgages).

The US's is NTSC, which runs at 29.97 frames per second, which is accomplished (when converting from 24 frames-per-second film) by a process called 2:3 pulldown (this avoids any speed-up, slow-down, or pitch discrepancies).

Since all ""Doctor Who"" is shot on video in Wales, whose standard is PAL, it's shot at 25 frames per second.  A type of pulldown is used when converting for NTSC DVDs which means there is no slow-down or pitch difference compared to the 25fps original.

This is a problem with the TV movie, which was shot in Vancouver, Canada, on 35mm film, at 24fps.  The only way to go from 24 to 25 frames per second without jerky motion is a simple 4% speedup, which causes the pitch increase and shorter running time.

But in making the NTSC DVD, the BBC used the same pulldown method they use for any other DW DVD, preserving the speed and pitch of the PAL DVD, which (for the TV movie) is incorrect.

What I'm curious about is ""Spearhead from Space"" - that was shot on 35mm film as well, but I don't know for sure if it was shot at 24 or 25 frames per second.

Nothing really at club level but I do remember liking a lot of the German stars, especially Lahm, Schweinsteiger, Ballack and Kahn. I remember seeing clips of Ronaldinho when I was young, and he still remains as one of my favourite players to watch of all time.

The first time I ever really sat down for a club level game was the 2007 Champions League final, Chelsea and Manchester United. I was pulling for Chelsea because of Ballack mostly - with my German roots and relative ignorance of club teams, cheering for the team with the German captain felt right. I watched the loss today and while it didn't have as big an impact on me at the time, rewatching it today is pretty tough. But I liked seeing a bunch of players show so much emotion, so it's hard for me to accept that this team is a bunch of mercenaries. 

I obviously became a Chelsea fan after the Roman takeover but I never really had experienced one of his massive spending sprees until this winter. Since getting into Chelsea, my love for the sport and club has grown dramatically. I watch any and all games that Chelsea are a part of [granted, of course that I can find a stream]. I started playing soccer too, I hadn't as a kid but now I captain both an indoor and outdoor squad.

true,weblypistol,cnty-uk,Llanfairpwllgwyngyll.... etc.,"1, This is an extreme, the most extreme example. Now why would this story be out now? Note the publication is part of the Daily Mail group.

2, If this is an extreme example, what is the average overtime pay? Well it varies. A quarter of overtime payment went to the Met alone at £4,271 per officer. Elsewhere is considerably less. So there is overtime spending, but no-where near the horrendous figure of £67,000, and certainly not something that can be described excessive.

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/police-officers-pocket-38-billion-in-overtime-2234529.html

3, If there is overtime, it suggests need. Work practices in the past were described as near Stalinist if people wanted to work to rule. You know, employment contracts. Overtime was something expected to be done to meet demand. So if demand is there, and police are to be cut back, what kind of efficiency spending is going reclaim expense? Maybe crime should only be permitted on a four day week basis between daylight hours. The other option is to cut pay. Of course police could strike and... oh no wait, they can't. Police pay is set by the 1980 PNB to act as a defence against government interference ( such as seems to be coming from the Home Office). The bargain then is police can't advocate to strike, something they have not been allowed to do for a century in fact.

So, lost police, lower paid force, less overtime. Rising crime, riots... Probably less pesky regulation and stupid red tape that acts as a bulwark to injustice, or allowing reasonable unsafe measures currently held at bay by stupid health and safety trying to protect the public. Less legal rights too. What could possibly go wrong?",0,1299684377,null,0,true,0,c1k01u3,t3_g0egj,t1_c1k01u3,t3_g0egj,1426972817,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

River Song is a terrible character because she's fanfiction, and badly written fanfiction at that.

As for ""third party companies"", mine always said they got it from the ""open directory"" or BS like that, they won't tell you where they actually got it from, because the person on the other end of the line won't know, they just get paid to make the calls.

Of course it isn't a peer-reviewed academic paper. You are correct. (Reddit is peer-reviewed though via upvoting and downvoting if you consider that everyone on reddit is your ""peer"").

&gt; It is a glorified internet chat-board.

Correct.

&gt; It's where people come for stupid pictures of cats.

Perhaps it is where you come for stupid pictures of cats. I come for news. Others come for advice.

&gt; So lets stop trying to make ourselves seem intellectual by spewing the 'citation' comment everywhere.

So lets stop asking people to cite the source of their information? Sure I can google-fu and find the information myself (which I did) but doesn't it seem kind of dumb to just take people for their word without a source?

[Economic Disaster Area](http://reddit.comhttp://www.economicdisasterarea.com/index.php/tag/kaupthing/) 

A very crude and basic summary: Kaupþing were into all sorts of crazy stuff such as making dodgy loans to themselves, apparently faking investment from anonymous investors hours before the crash to appear solvent and creating a house of cards. The house of cards they created was particularly damaging to Iceland as at the time it was the largest bank still standing in the country (Landsbanki had already failed) and it's size in relation to the country's GDP left it brutally exposed. They were playing games and paying each other off (through proxies such as wives) hours before the bank went under and with it, the country's economy. 

The investigation into this and more has been going on in Iceland by the Special Prosecutor and police for quite some time now and they have been working with the SFO for a long period. There was a period in Iceland where sordid accounts of the banker behaviour were coming out daily as a result of the investigation, I get the impression that if the British authorities merely scratched the surface closer to home they will find just as outrageous behaviour if not, worse.",0,1299714736,null,0,false,0,c1k2trz,t3_g0mpw,t1_c1k2trz,t1_c1k2oav,1426974125,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Instead of performing multiple rounds, voters could specify where their vote goes ahead of time if their preferred candidate is elimated. This could be done by specified by stating a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, ..., preference.

Being of a younger generation does not automatically make you smarter than the previous one. Indeed, looking at your comments I'm not convinced that this is true of you.

&gt; I mean you only have to look at technological and scientific exams to show this. Or further still why we are killing each other with computers instead of sticks and stones.

Yes, because your father clearly was a caveman or something, and dropping computers on Iraqis and Afghans causes far more damage than sticks and stones.

&gt; Thankfully I am trying my hardest to get a job

Saw your other post about the jobs, so I'll leave that comment there. I appreciate your situation, my youngest brother went to poly in the 70s and came out just in time for the 3 day week. He couldn't get a job doing anything at all for almost all of the 70s, dad kicked him out of the house because he thought he was being feckless (truth be told, after a year of being turned down for menial work it takes a special kind of person not to give up) so he moved in with me and my then girlfriend in London. He got a job the next day at the local wimpy then 2 months later he got a job at Eddie Stobart working on truck movements. It would've taken about 2 months back then for him to move his dole (at least that's what they told him at the dole office before coming down). If we weren't around he wouldn't have been able to do it. Seriously, if you've got the balls to go and work at a repro job, McDonalds' management trainee program is worth a look - [24500](http://www.mcdonalds.co.uk/static/pdf/aboutus/education/mcd_recruitment_training.pdf) a year starting salary for central London rising to 45k in 3 years, and you can go pretty much anywhere after that.

And yes you can get this information from elsewhere, but in a world that is already privacy conscious where would you get it from?  Can you force credit card agencies to give up the information?  How do you deduplicate information from many sources?

I really don't see this. I haven't seen a question on the census asking ""are you a potential terrorist"". The statement is subliminal racism/islamaphobia etc in effect. ""Is your name Abdul?....TERRORIST!""

The one near Wilkos in town is pretty quiet most days.

I'm also going to have to re-recommend Maximillions as the sandwiches there are just plain special. I don't think you'd live long if you had one every day though. Also the bloke who runs it is the least happy person in Bristol which is usually amusing.

Oh there are a few places in St Nick's that will do some decent lunch, most of them are worth trying at least once.

Falafel king of course if you like it and don't mind them being annoyingly slow (from the van at the bottom of park street).

These days I mostly make a sandwich at home and eat in Castle park. When it rains there are a bunch of pubs on the street next to St Nicks that let you take your own sandwiches in if you buy a drink.

These are mightily useful skills with which to show you are truly the master of your domain. No wonder you strut around these threads, puffing out your chest, and issuing broadsides to all who cause you a momentary irritation.

How would devolution result in a **less** isolated Wales?


&gt;There is no debate because you have not answered the first point I made about your condescending nature properly.

I have already addressed this! Perhaps you missed the part where I asked you to show me where what I said could have been interpreted as being condescending. 
Pointing out my alleged 'condescension' by outdoing me in being condescending? Well done you!


&gt;the insults began with you

You're lying. The insults actually started with you. I mean, it is so annoying when people do this. Luckily, the evidence is up there, I just read through the comments again and you were the one who began to use insults first i.e. 'fool'. Are you a politician by any chance?


&gt;Just because your friends didn't know anything about the issues doesn't mean many others didn't.

Why do you think WAG should be given more power? What is wrong with new laws being agreed on by more people and a wider audience? 


&gt;You're just joining in with the Welsh are stupid chorus. Your points are humourless and in fact more vitriolic than what I've said.

Nobody ever said that the Welsh are stupid. Now that just came from you, you said it. In fact, you're the first person to actually say that here. I think the problem is that you take something and tend to  misinterpret it.
However, I did mention that those who voted yes were perhaps ignorant from personal experience. That isn't the same thing as calling the entire Welsh population stupid.


&gt;You can't feign moral superiority and expect to get anywhere with that.

A much better argument would be ""You can't hold a bitter malicious attitude and expect to get anywhere with that"". I think it's quite clear that I was encouraging a more positive and polite atmosphere. You were the only few people here who had a different opinion from the majority, so I thought it was a great opportunity to discuss.  Unfortunately it was a total put-off for me, when it turned out you had such a bad attitude. 


&gt;Do you call anyone with a pro Welsh attitude a nationalist?

I find that nationalists tend to hold violently pro-'my country' opinions, and usually their justifications are often irrational. Did you vote 'yes' - just because ""I am proud to be Welsh""? 


&gt;someone who doesn't like disrespectful people like yourself thinking you can try to dominate a debate

What - to you? How can you expect anyone to respect you when you're such a moody mess?

I think you're probably one of the most disrespectful person I have ever come across on reddit. I feel trolled. As you can tell, I have been patient with you and you're throwing it all back in my face. If you don't want to discuss about Wales then that's fine. It's okay - just say. I feel you are abusing my patience and I am starting to get the feeling that you don't even want to discuss, but prefer personal attacks.

The basis of your argument is that property rights should be held up as more important than human need. The example of food is a case where it is clearly false.

Absolutely, although I'd want to remove furniture etc first, and check up on them every now and again.

The best argument I've heard for squatting is Costa Rica, though it's been abused. Costa Rica is one of the most egalitarian and least corrupt societies in Latin America because of squatting. Instead of Mexico where you have fiefdoms of families who control all of the land and migrants flee rather than endure virtual sharecropping, Costa Rica allows people who work land to possess it.

The small farmer has power. This leads to a strong society.

The abuse is that someone spends a lot of money on a vacation home, or perhaps they travel for work and find squatters in their home. And reasonably the squatters should leave. But there's a sense of entitlement that is disrespectful. If I'm sitting at a park bench and leave, I shouldn't expect to have it back. But if I rent a building for business and go home and sleep, someone shouldn't open up shop in my building overnight.

Well, squatting is business. So you can farm and make use of land. Not steal someone's residence. You can't have a wealthy few steal the country from the people, but you can't have the people stealing homes from other people.

To reinforce your point, the problem is that squatters' rights don't make sense because squatters rarely make sense. When the person who pays the bills comes back, vacate. Or better yet, don't violate someone's personal property. If so, pay them for it.",0,1299800203,null,0,false,0,c1k8gqy,t3_g1dsm,t1_c1k8gqy,t1_c1k7yr7,1426976850,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

Adric is my least favorite companion yet Earthshock is my favorite episode.  Go fig.  Mel is a close second.

My least favorite Doctor accessory is 6th Doctor's rainbow umbrella followed closely by 7th Doctor's umbrella handle.

My least favorite modern series rebooted villain is the Master.  Or would that be 17th Master?* (assuming Delgado was 13th Master and the first 12 were never shown.)  He should be shrinking people to death, not laser screwing them!

Least favorite episode would probably be Time and the Rani.  I didn't care for season 24 but I enjoyed 25 and 26.

My least favorite line of DW is probably River explaining the TARDIS landing noise which had been explained before as the relative dimensional stabilizer was just because the Doctor leaves the brakes on.  Apparently the Master, the Rani and all Time Lords do too.

My least favorite classic enemy are the Zargons because it's damn hard to understand them and they look ridiculous.  Besides, the Terror of the Zargons seemed a tad racist towards Scots and Americans.

My least favorite sonic screwdriver is 11th Doctor's.  I don't like that after it springs out, he has to reset it by hand.  It makes it seem like more of a toy than a tool.

Also, I hate the St. John's Ambulance badge on the TARDIS.  I know 1st Doctor had it but 2nd-10th didn't.  It feels like it was put back on to sell more TARDIS stuff to people who already hit their saturation point on TARDIS stuff.

I also hate that Jon Pertwee seems to get ignored by many people getting in to the show because he's not Tom Baker.  While Baker is my favorite Doctor, Pertwee would probably be the most underrated if so many didn't consider McCoy the worst(I say Colin Baker is myself.  I like that the best and worst Doctors are both Bakers.)  Still, his stories are good and I love his rivalry with the Master.  The Sea Devils is not to be missed!

Lack of any top-down authority is one of the major issues I have with anarchic theories in practice; I've read suggestions from private judiciaries and police forces to socially enforced ostracism, but none of them seem particularly good at safeguarding the individual.

My reason for advocating voluntarism is rooted in deontological ethics more than anything else. Basically, even accepting problematic consequences, I don't see that as sufficient justification for violations of individual rights that are a necessary component of the modern state. Taxation isn't actually my main issue because at the end of the day demonstrating any sort of objective property rights in anything but your own body absent a social contract is problematic (although it still intuitively *feels* wrong to me), it's more a question of ""why does X group of people have a legitimate claim to authority over me or anyone else?"".

Squatting provides a very useful safety valve on housing, which is massively overpriced in the ludicrous modern market. It is tragic that every year people die for exposure from sleeping out in the rough, when there are plenty of spare roofs to shelter them.

Some have presented the argument, ""why should I pay for housing while you squat?"" and that is a good question. Perhaps they should squat as well. The idea that because some people are willing and able to pay over the odds for their homes, all others should do the same is ridiculous.

That said, there's no obvious reason why I shouldn't be able to evict people from property I own within about 30 minutes of noticing they are there.

Totally agree with your conclusion, if not necessarily the reason given.

The most important thing about the BBC for me is that it is a notionally run ""by the people, for the people"" and not for profit.

A perfect example being football.  I'm not a football fan myself, but lots of people are.

In the good old days you could watch football on TV on a saturday afternoon without having to pay for it.  The BBC and ITV both covered matches including Division 1 (as the premier league used to be called - now I'm showing my age).  If memory serves they would take it in turns to show the FA cup final.  BBC one year, ITV the next.

Then Sky came along and threw so much money around that it was quickly priced out of the reach of both ITV and the BBC.  And where did the money come from?  From the Sky subscribers who now had to pay to watch football on TV instead of getting it for free (well, included in the price of the licence fee in the case of the BBC).

Murdoch specialises in taking something that's free or very cheap, and making people pay for it.  The more they pay, the more money he gets, and the more leverage he can exert to push the price up while stifling competition.  Football, cricket, what's next?

At the moment he can't ~~crush~~ compete with the BBC because they're isolated from market forces (i.e. money) to a large degree.  When the BBC lost the premier league to Sky, loads of football fans were forced to take up Sky subscriptions.  Of course they couldn't ""cancel"" their BBC subscriptions because you don't have the choice about ""subscribing"" to the BBC.  But that's what Murdoch would like to see - competition based solely on how much money/influence you have - because it's a game that he can play very well.

Indeed, there's a lot of flash in there: the 11 on the Jersey, the significance of it being the eleventh episode, the fact that Smith was a footballer who turned to acting after a knee injury and the Doctor's dominance on the field . . . all good fun, yeah?

But the fact that the episode seems so light makes me think it might end up one of the most important episodes of Eleven's first season. (Spoilers ahead)

What I should have said was that it was the first time in the scope of the current story arc that we've seen the Tardis subject to external control. The Time Lords, of course, controlled it to the point of irritation throughout the original series. It was running from Jack and his paradoxical condition in Utopia, though, rather than being controlled, strictly speaking, but the Daleks were able to at least close and lock the door remotely in Journey's End. And although the Doctor says in the Lodger that there's ""something big,"" the time engine, as it turns out, keeping the Tardis from materializing, I still have to wonder, as it let the Tardis materialize long enough for him to step out and look around.

No points, I guess, for noticing that he mentions they haven't gone where they'd intended when he steps out, as this has been the norm since the show's inception, to varying degrees.

In the end, though, the DIY Tardis gets a good, long scan of the Doctor at its console, before he convinces Craig to step up. The time ship, rather than going all defunct because of Craig's reluctance to leave, disappears, and the Doctor tidies up the event by flirting with paradox, having Amy pen the note that led him to Craig's in the first place. Next thing you know, really, Vincent's painting splodey time machines, and the whole of reality is threatened by something the Doctor can only solve with the same sort of time stream looping.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I agree with you that we shouldn't post spoilers in the titles, but I think we're disagreeing about what counts as a spoiler.

My opinion is that within the Doctor Who subreddit, a week or so after the episodes have aired in all/most territories, everything should be fair game. In all of the fan forums I've been on over the years this has generally been the rules (although for shows like Lost often it was just the US air date that they bothered about).

There is no diffinitive right answer here. What do you consider spoilers? Surely someone could argue that it's a spoiler to reveal that Susan's grandfather is a time traveller. In the very first episode An Unearthly Child there is a mystery about why Susan is so strange and why the old man in the junk yard is acting odd. It's conceivable that someone picked this DVD up in a store without knowing anything about Doctor Who, saw this subreddit, subscribed, and is now cross that the time travel element has been revealed.

I know it's an extreme example, but I hope it illustrates my point that there is no right answer here, what we decide is a spoiler will just depend on what we think is best for the subreddit and the people who read it overall.

My opinion is that once an episode has aired in the UK, US etc. we should be OK to mention everything in the title of a post. I think this because otherwise we'd end up having to click through to every link just to see what it related to. I think Reddit works because you can quickly scan a list of headlines and see if you're interested in the articles that they link to. I think that if we use the spoiler policy that you prefer then this will no longer be the case.

Again, no right or wrong, just my opinion about what is best.

You asked if (and yes it is an extreme example but it still holds) revealing the secret identity of Susan's grandfather would be a spoiler. Yes it would. But you don't need to. There is no reason for that information to be in the title. A title such as: Question about Susan's Grandfather (spoilers) would be perfectly acceptable.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;By your definition is there such thing as a spoiler? If every single thing that happens in an episode as soon as it airs is fair game then what isn't?

There are huge spoilers online for things in upcoming episodes of Doctor Who. I already know way more about Series 6 than I'd like, but I would never put any of that info in a title link. I wouldn't even mention things I've seen in trailers.

&gt;Can you imagine using that logic on another medium? The day after a book is released every single twist should be in post titles on /r/books?

I wouldn't do that, but I think in a specific subreddit is different to a general one. As I said earlier, I wouldn't reveal anythig in r/scifi about Doctor Who, but I think r/doctorwho is different. For instance I think it would be fine in r/harrypotter (don't know if it exists, I'll assume it does) to talk about Harry and Ginny getting together, ie: ""DAE not buy Harry and Ginny as a couple?"" would be a fine title for me.

In my view, once you hit subscribe on a specific reddit (whether that is Doctor Who or Harry Potter) I think you tacitly agree to be witness to the conversations of other fans, and it's to be expected that these other fans are up to date with the episodes/books. It would be as if you went to stand in line for Harry Potter book 7, it's only to be expected that you'll overhear other fans inline talking about the end of book 6.

true,[deleted],null,null,"**Least favourite episode:** 
fear her.  Fear Her. FEAR HER.  Everything about that episode pissed me off.  It had no good lines, the acting wasn't great and ""the olympic torch, a symbol of love and hope""?! No.  The olympic torch is a symbol of nationalist competition and one upmanship. Nobody has ever looked at the olympic torch and been like ""yup.  Love.""  Also the evil dad thing AFTER the space whatsit left was stupid.  Hate that episode so much.

**Least favourite Villain:** EDIT:  The sensorites. They're a psychic species with almost no vision who base their rank on visual indicators.  

**Least Favourite Special:** The first Christmas special.  The doctor being asleep and useless for most of the episode was a TERRIBLE way to introduce us to Tennant.  ""hey look, the new doctor.  He sleeps and does nothing.""  Then he woke up, had 10 minutes of greatness and then they had the end where he ruins Harriet Jones' career.  Which annoyed me for several reasons:

1) I liked Harriet Jones.  She was sweet, and motherly and did the ""Harriet Jones, prime minister/Flydale North"" thing.  So having them ruin her career annoyed me.

2) I agreed with Harriet Jones.  The bad guys had, less than 5 minutes earlier shown their willingness to stab you in the back after surrendering.  They'd stated that they had a full invasion fleet waiting.  They were probably coming back.  AND even if they weren't.  What were they going to do?  Run away and give up slavery?  No.  they were going to go enslave some other race.  They were a menace to the universe that needed to be knocked down a peg.  Plus, sleeping doctor the whole time.  She watched people die. She had a duty.

3) Tennant hadn't really settled into the role of the Doctor yet.  He was still just some 20something guy in a robe to me so watching him act all superior and mighty didn't really sit right with me because he didn't carry the maturity the throw around morality like that yet.

moving on.

**Least Favourite Companion:** Martha.  Say what you will about Rose, at least she didn't spend her entire season whining about not being Rose.  Rose was a blank slate generic mary sue companion, Donna was sassy and fantastic, the earlier companions I've seen had SOMETHING going for them, hell, even Mickey served a purpose.  But Martha was just a filler, a soda cracker to get the taste of Rose out of our mouth to move on to the new companions.

**Least Favourite Companion Departure:** Susan.  Because they never resolved it.  Really.  Is she still in the year 2200 or whenever?  Why doesn't the Doctor ever visit her?  Isn't the fact she can live for hundreds of years kind of a major problem to her marrying that dude?  WHY Doesn't The Doctor Ever Visit Her? Did she get pulled into the time lock?  Does she have part time lord kids running around the universe?  WHY DOESN'T THE DOCTOR EVER VISIT HER?!  Aren't her parent's (the doctor's children) kinda pissed that he ditched her somewhere and never went back?  Where ARE the Doctor's children?  The whole thing just bugs me.

**Least Favourite Ending:**  Waters of Mars. I loved it right until the point where [he goes back.  It was a brilliant emotional ending where the Doctor had to abandon the people and, over his headset *listen* to them all die, not being able to do anything, that would have made a poignant message about how even the Doctor can't save everyone and sometimes people have to die. ](/spoiler)

[But then he turns around, tries to save them, saves 2, threatens human advancement into space and then fails anyways in a way that makes no sense whatsoever because the fixed point was supposed to be that she died in space causing her daughter to go out after her and in her footsteps.  Her dying on earth would just be confusing to everyone involved.  I was actually deeply emotionally moved and tearing up before he went back, afterwards I was annoyed and confused.](/spoiler)",0,1299881050,null,0,true,0,c1kdffq,t3_g1hq8,t1_c1kdffq,t3_g1hq8,1426979254,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

I was homeless at 17 and was advised, off the record, to either get pregnant or get married because I wasn't even going to get on a waiting list till I was 21. This was 25 years ago.
Having tried all the proper channels, I felt I had no real option but to break into an empty house and live there. I got water and electricity switched on and paid the bills from my benefit. Then I got a job, but several times came home from work to find the house had been boarded up and I had to break in again.
Much of the time I had no money and lived from food I found in supermarket bins, which was not always available and I sometimes had to go hungry.

At the moment, private landlords set their rent minimums to whatever they can get from housing benefit, which is one of the things keeping property prices so ridiculously high.  
Right now the country is plagued by By-To-Let landlords who are holding houses hostage which would normally be bought by a family looking to settle, but they are instead forced to rent from these parasites. Reducing the amount of housing benefit, will force them to reduce their rent, which will remove the majority of amateur wannabe landlords from the mix and drop property prices like a stone to the point where an average wage once again buys you an average house, and housing benefit will stretch a lot further.

Would need a few years work experience, no?

- AirCon engineer

How many people are trained in this? Also by the time you have trained the job will be taken. So then *move* to where the job is... Again my point about HB.

- Area Manager

Pretty sure people don't just walk into these jobs. Firms may have a 'Area Manager' already set up and awaiting training too, they have to advertise for 'legal' purposes so they do not look unfair. (6 years part time in a supermarket branch taught me this)

- Beauty Therapist

Needs training. I have already 'trained' to be a designer, but there are no jobs in this, maybe I go and study Beauty Therapy? Good luck trying to get support after you have a degree.

- Building control engineer

This would need work experience or training to a VERY high level. They'd laugh my CV right into the bin!

Human society has been created by humans. I don't suppose it was planned, as such, but we have invented our civilisation in some way. 
The better our ability to communicate and educate ourselves about the world, the better we might seek to become masters of our culture and civilisation. 
 
Why shouldn't we aim to create a society in which we place a high value on fulfilling work and a cooperative approach to meeting everyday needs?

Every job you cite there will have many applicants. Only one person gets the job. 

Regarding the thirty vacancies at your workplace, do they require skills and education? Maybe the qualified people are not there. 

Are the jobs meaningless and badly paid? Why should someone not resist that if they can survive by other means?
