I didn't like Marseille much but there's no denying there is a lot of culture and beautiful stuff to see. [Les Calanques](http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Europe/France/Provence_Alpes_Cote_dAzur/Marseille-104587/Things_To_Do-Marseille-Les_Calanques-BR-1.html) is an incredible sight and I could spend 5-7 days there alone. You can easily take a city bus (I can't remember the exact number but I want to say L21) to the last stop which is Luminy and from there you follow a well marked, easy trail about a mile to these stunning cliffs and hidden inlets. my friends and I would make the trip all the time and jump into the water from the cliffs. The water is some of the bluest I've seen and you won't see many other people there because the mile and a half walk weeds out most of the lazy tourists. Or you can take a tour by boat, but I can assure you that you'll be dying to jump off the boat and lay on the rocks and swim.

I don't know where you're from originally, but I was spoiled by Florida's miles of white sandy beaches. Don't expect that around Marseille. Things tend to be a bit rocky and smaller, but you'll get beaches surrounded by rocky hills and you'll be in a port that's been active for more than 2000 years which Florida can't begin to top.

From Marseille you can get to a lot of other cool places that aren't on the beach but will give you a chance to see Provence. for 5 Euros you can get to Aix-en-Provence, Arles is nearby and has a nice roman [amphitheater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arles_Amphitheatre), Avignon is a bit farther away but still accessible by bus for cheap.

You can also check TER train prices for visiting places a bit farther like Nice. It goes a little slower and stops more often but it's cheaper and let's you have a nice relaxing roll through the area.

As for Normany I'd just look into booking a train as early as possible too keep it cheap. Sorry I'm no help on hotels! As for french, just always say bonjour/au revoir madame/monsieur. Never just go up to someone and start with ""do you speak english?"" or ""where is the vieux port?"" Always start by saying bonjour then asking a question even in English. I think this alone takes down a lot of Americans who are unfamiliar with telling random people hello before asking a question, but I think it'd be nice if we adopted it. Other than that you'll be okay without French!

North, on the channel, where you get Normandy and Omaha beach.

North-western, brittany, at the junction of the channel and the atlantic ocean. It's a nice place which has a strong culture of its own.

Middle-west, on the ocean, is more bland and is famous for its sailing culture.

South-west, still on the ocean, is famous for its beaches and surfing culture.

Then south-east, the cote d'azur / french riviera, which is on the mediterranean sea. This is a warmer climate and the sea is calmer than the ocean (almost no tide). This same label extends to the french island of Corsica, which is wonderful.


One word on Marseille, since I'm a native from there : it's a beautiful city, but the city beaches are absolutely below par. If you want real beaches you would have to go at least out of town to the calanques or more easternwards on the coast, preferrably east of Toulon.

true,Mugros,,Niedersachsen,"Not a good article.

There was a study about antisemitism in Germany lately, but this is only hinted in the first paragraph and a small figure later. I expected to get a better commentary on this study.

&gt; You would expect loud and righteous outrage

No, you don't. It's Germany. Germans aren't loud and rage if it comes to issues about WW2 and the holocaust. So ""Mein Kampf"" is published in Germany? As a German I say ""big deal"". Nothing will change because of that. Over 60 years after the war this ""ban"" makes no sense anyway. As it is said, it's not forbidden, so anyone interested in it, already has it anyway.

&gt; Seligmann: ""People feel it's not enough to have a 'Holocaust identity'""

Yes, he is right. That's the problem with the Jewish identity. Most people, if they hear ""Jew"", think WW2/holocaust/Hitler. I don't know any Jew here in Germany, barely see synagogues. There is simply no exposure to Jewish culture. I know more about modern Jews from American TV than real life in Germany. And without good integration into the society it's really hard to build a good image.

&gt;The head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, said: ""Of course, it would be better if it were not published. But if it has to be published, it must be accompanied by historians' commentary.""

OK, one exception to what I said above. THIS exposure we get a lot. The Central Council of Jews is like the additional German conscience we neither want or need. Whenever there is sometimes happening concerning Jews in Germany, they make a big deal out of it. They always remind of the cruels of WW2 in this context. I'm against forgetting what happened, but I'm also against keeping up the national guilt that is put upon modern Germans. And that is what they are doing. If the Jews want to get a better image in Germany, it would be a good start to stop pointing fingers at all Germans all the time. So, when Mr. Seligmann sees the 80% non-antisemitic, the Central Council of Jews will always point out the 20% antisemitism. 

And now to what he says about the publication of ""Mein Kampf"": Why is it better that it's not being published in Germany? It has been published all over the world (I guess except Israel) and has there been an outcry because of this? There are more Jews living in the US and you can get the book there freely. Is this a problem for US Jews?

So, and if it is published ""it must be accompanied by historians' commentary""? Really. He makes is look like this book is some kind of trigger that turns each German on sight into Nazis. It's a book, written by a dictator. From what I heard it's not even a good read. But I didn't expect it to be anyway. No one will become antisemitic by reading it. Also not Germans. Maybe especially not Germans.

Then the author talks about immigration. I regard this as a different topic.

The beaches are very nice and not all of them are private such as can be found around places in Côte d'Azur closer to Saint Juan les pins and Cannes.

Other than that places near the Esterel are very nice too and give opportunities for horseback riding or hiking in the mounts as well as pristing water and beaches which are in nice little ""criques"".

But beware - the Mediterranean sea is now known for the widespread presence of jellyfish. Perhaps find a hotel that has a pool so as not to ruin your whole stay because of the jellyfish.

Adding to this, I have to say that to find a good hotel, you should visit the area with Google maps street view.

- The problem with foreigners on the autobahn is that they don't expect really fast cars from the back. If you change to left lanes, you have to check the horizon for fast cars first.
- Kids: Well, according to a recent similar post here on Reddit, Germans love babies. So there doesn't seem to be a consensus on that.
- New people: yes, as a German I find it strange that a person which was a complete stranger to me a second ago would start to hug and kiss me. To me thats simply fake behavior. Hugs and kisses are signs of affection. And a stranger can't have genuine feelings like this for me. 
- Smokers: While they are still common, it depends on the social circle you're in. 
- Jaywalking: What's up with that obsession of jaywalking? 
- Doorknobs: On the main entrance there is something like a doorknob. While they are usually not found inside private homes you'll find them elsewhere.
- Shoes: No, it's not a must. Maybe where you lived. I grew up in Germany and in most cases you don't have to take off your shoes. In the academic field I meet a lot of foreigners and it is much more common to take off your shoes at their places.
- Toilets: Flachspüler vs. Tiefspüler. There are regional differences. I hate the former too. Luckily they are not common in northern Germany. And if you're really up for a surprise, go to northern Italy. Some years ago I still found holes in the ground as public toilets.
- Sundays: There is always a bakery open on Sunday. It doesn't make sense to have all bakeries open, because there are not enough customers. Labor is not cheap in Germany, that's also a reason why there is no 24/7 service. But it's better today. Before shops closed at 6pm or noon on Saturdays. Now you can always find some store open until 10pm. Which is fine.

&gt;Yes, he is right. That's the problem with the Jewish identity. Most people, if they hear ""Jew"", think WW2/holocaust/Hitler. I don't know any Jew here in Germany, barely see synagogues. There is simply no exposure to Jewish culture. I know more about modern Jews from American TV than real life in Germany. And without good integration into the society it's really hard to build a good image.

So what you're saying is the problem with Jewish identity is that its defined by its recent history. What the fuck do you expect?

Hmm, and why might there be limited exposure to Jews in Germany. There must be a reason... That said, I see evidence of Jewish culture in Berlin on a daily basis. Not everyone lives in a backwater town.

&gt;The Central Council of Jews is like the additional German conscience we neither want or need. 

And that attitude is exactly why you need it. The situation will not be improved by less discussion or less analysis. The Council, being comprised of humans, is not prefect, but their existence is a very good thing.

&gt;So, when Mr. Seligmann sees the 80% non-antisemitic, the Central Council of Jews will always point out the 20% antisemitism.

Why the hell wouldn't they. It means that over 16 **million** Germans still profess antisemitism attitudes.

We have to watch where our money goes and make sure it fulfills its purpose. We have to prioritize our efforts to areas that help. If you have enough money to have growth, even in the deepest crisis, it would be considered a waste of energy and resource to optimize and prioritize your efforts. And in countries, where there is much room for optimization, this could maybe even produce growth, even in times of austerity.

But since eternal growth for everyone is a myth, a crisis is a good exercise for the times, where will have exploited all our resources, are not able to significantly improve our productivity anymore, etc. to start thinking about how a sustainable future without long term growth can look like.

btw. Austerity does not mean we all get our budgets balanced in times of crisis. That would be a dream, even for Germany. It just means that you bring your new debts in times of crisis to a level that is possible to at least partly pay back after the crisis.

First of all, you are right about exactly one thing: ""The Jews"" is a generalization much like ""the Germans""  - I guess Mugros could have worded it better.

But the rest of your post are baseless accusations and nonsensical generalizations. Mugros simply summed up the perception of Jews in Germany, and as far as I can tell, he is mostly correct. Therefore, for the rest of my post, feel free to substitute ""The Jews"" with ""The Jewish council in Germany representing the opinions of a significant fraction of the Jewish minority in Germany"". 

Yes, Jews have been persecuted. Yes, Jews have been at a disadvantage. But does that give them a justification to behave in such a way, and always enforce their point of view? I don't think so. And, as Mugros points out, it leads to a problematic perception, as saying that ""The German people should not be exposed to Mein Kampf"" is simply patronizing. Exactly why does the Jewish council believe that the average German could not handle this book?

Finally, you are confusing that Mugros (and me) are mostly talking about how *other people*, meaning most Germans, perceive this, not how *we* perceive it. So accusing him of disliking Jews is nonsensical for this reason alone, as he is talking more about a general perception, not so much his (or my) opinion.

Also, I actually know a few Jews in Germany. Aside from usually having a lot of knowledge about Israel and Judaism, and being unusually smart, they do not really stand out at all, so what the Jewish council in Germany says does not reflect on them.

You are essentially saying that ""criticizing Jews for not wanting to publish Mein Kampf is anti-semitism"". But that is simply nonsense, because then by your definition *anyone* who simply strongly advocates free speech would be an anti-semite.

More importantly, the resentment you are talking about is created not by the fact that these people are Jews, but simply because they disagree!

Even from your own blog it´s easy to tell that, despite the decrease in volume, the EU is by far the most important market for the UK? You seem to think that the world consists of two markets - RoW and EU? The EU is one trade block and internal market, thus the UK can trade within it using one set of agreements/rules, for the rest of the world the are numerous fractured market where they don´t have that benefit. You´re being highly selective with your data and painting a black and white scenario where there is none.

Furthermore you are extrapolating the current trend for the past 10 years into a prediction, whereas any economist worth his or her salt will tell you that such a thing is nigh impossible to predict. Building upon this one can arguably state that the decrease in trade is the UK´s own doing, for better or for worse, by not participating more actively in EU integration. Note that I´m not saying the UK ought to have done so, but I believe that the decrease in trade is a result of this.

For instance a quick look [here](https://www.uktradeinfo.com/index.cfm?task=topPartners) shows that the US is the largest single trade partner, and constituted 13,1% of trade for 2011. Admittedly it is only one source, but let´s run with it for now. Note on that list number 2-9 are all EU members, and their added shares amount to 44,6%.

true,sztomi,HUNG,Hungary,"I'm no supporter of Fidesz (quite the opposite), but I have a couple of problems with this article.

He treats the question of changing the constitution as if it was something a country is not allowed to do. It is. There are good reasons to change the now-previous constitution of Hungary. A debate is only valid about the changes it brought.

My reflections on his arguments:

1. **Fidesz and the 2/3 of seats**. He is right about the electoral system being imperfect. When a party gets 55% of the votes, they shouldn't have 68% of the seats. However, electoral systems are inherently unjust one way or another - I think there was someone who got a Nobel price for proving this. The second part of the argument is that Fidesz, according to recent polls, is unpopular. But show me a party in any country that is popular in the middle of their 4 year period, in this economical crisis.

2. **Public consultation** I agree with this point

3. **Consultation with the EU** I don't know whether this is true or not. My opinion is that there are several problems with the constitution and the way the government acted, but the foreign reaction might be overheated by the our government's arrogant attitude in the past months. 

4. **Replacing communist constitution**. This is true. The previous constitution was written in 1949, in the middle of communist oppression and was patched up in 1990. I can believe that technically it would have worked (it workd for a good 20 years) but I agree that the symbolic step of replacing it is required. 

5. **""The preamble asserts that sovereignty rests in the Hungarian “nation” (that is, ethnic Hungarians and not Hungarian citizens of all ethnicities)""** This is simply a false statement. The preamble states (in the official translation): *The nationalities living with us form part of the Hungarian political community and are constituent parts of the State.* and *The source of public power shall be the people.* (article B/3). 

6. **""It also includes potentially destabilizing references to Hungary’s “historic constitution” that implicitly laid claim to territories now belonging to neighboring states.""** An ""implicitly laid claim"" is just an opinion, so I can't really disprove it. If I'm right, he was referring to the following part: *""We promise to preserve the intellectual and piritual unity of our nation torn apart in the storms of the last century.*. Personally I don't see anything wrong with this.

7. **Translation mistakes** - True, and I don't which is worse: if it was intentional or truly an accident. Both sucks for a government.

8. **Private members' bills** - True, this is their way of abusing the 2/3 of votes. They are writing laws as if the Parliament was a factory. 

9. **Christianity** - Meh. It's true that the constitution reflects christian values, but I don't think there is much problem with that. Being an atheist myself (not the agressive redditor atheist stereotype), I don't see how this would effect me or my freedom to choose my beliefs.

In my opinion, the following are the real problems with the constitution:

  * Reduced checks and balances

  * Marriage defined as ""between man and woman"" (although, the author says ""ban on gay marriage"" which is misleading). 

  * Reduces codification of human rights

  * The Constitutional Court is weakened

  * Ombudsman system changed by ending several positions.

  * Tax and pension laws to require 2/3 of parliament votes to change

Situazioni assurde tipo: famiglia greca che vive all'estero si trasferisce in Italia per qualche mese per lavoro e ha un figlio mentre è in Italia. Una settimana dopo la nascita se ne tornano in Grecia, il bambino è cittadino italiano per tutta la vita anche se è stato in italia solo pochi giorni, non parla italiano e non sa nulla dell'Italia.

E pensa se la stessa famiglia ha avuto un altro bambino 1 anno prima quando ancora viveva in Grecia, i due fratelli hanno praticamente la stessa età, uno è cittadino Greco e uno Italiano.

Poi favorisce situazioni grottesche tipo clandestini che vanno a partorire in un altra nazione solo per far avere al figlio la cittadinanza.

Ma in ogni caso non ha senso legare la cittadinanza esclusivamente al posto dove eri quando sei nato (cosa oggettivamente irrilevante). Essere cittadino di una nazione vuol dire condividerne la lingua, le usanze, essere parte di una comunità, ecc ecc.

Il problema in Italia non è la mancanza dello ius soli ma la lentezza nel dare la cittadinanza a persone che sono a tutti gli effetti perfettamente inserite nella società italiana.

.

&gt; Lo ius soli è praticato da praticamente tutto il continente americano, e in molti stati (compresi molti stati europei) viene applicato con le dovute limitazioni, come credo personalmente sia giusto.

In Europa lo ius soli non esiste, se non hai almeno un genitore che è cittadino francese o inglese la cittadinanza non la prendi, punto.

.

&gt;Che poi nessuno vuole introdurre lo ius soli così com'è, ma si cerca un modo per mitigare l'anomalia di ragazzi, nati in italia da genitori con regolare permesso di soggiorno, che vivono tutta la loro vita (compresa educazione scolastica e culturale) in italia ma che non hanno la cittadinanza

Cioè vuoi una cosa che non è lo ius soli. Quindi sei d'accordo con me che è una cazzata e che il problema è un altro.

Thanks for the excellent explanation of your system, I actually really like it, specially the symmetrical budgets plan, I just don't think it's a solution to the current situation.

People have demands. Those demands will not completely vanish, they will have to be met in the future, and other people, who satisfy them will be needed. I didn't say that economic activity will not suffer at all.

&gt;&gt; growth is only needed, when you run up too many debts

&gt; It appears we (Europe) did.

Yes and no. Europe (the EU) has a lower debt level (per GDP) than both the USA and Japan. A number of countries by themself are above the USA level (according to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_public_debt) list Greece, Italy, Ireland and Belgium, but the data is a year old), but not a single country is even close to Japans debt level.

So, yes we have massive debts, but since the other big players have even more, we are comparatively not doing so bad.

Austerity (in form of constitutional debt breaks) is not supposed to be in effect immediately in the crisis. Instead this is a law for some time in the future. In Germany it was intruduced in 2009 and will be in full effect only in 2016. So there are 7 years of transition, where we step by step try to reach the goal. The idea is the following: showing investors that we really want to behave in the future will help us already in the closer future, or maybe even now. If you say, you don't want a debt break that will be in (full) effect in 7 or 10 years means, that you plan to run up more and more debts, even after the crisis.

I'm not sure what religion has to do with it specifically. I didn't bring it up. Even then, around 50 million Germans claim to be Christian and there are another 4 million Muslims. Yes religion is expressed differently than in, say, the United States, but to say that no one cares about it would be false.

If you cared to find out about the issue instead of going into full-on defensive mode you could see that [the study](http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/ikg/IntolerancePrejudice.pdf) defines antisemtism as ""social prejudice directed against Jews simply because they are Jewish.""

One example: **29.4%** of Germans agreed with the statement ""Jews in general do not care about anything or anyone but their own kind."" And **19.7%** think ""Jews have too much influence in Germany.""

Sure, the extreme right cares more about Muslims and Turks. But that's easily explained: they're much more visible in the country. To imply they don't care about the Jews, however, is disingenuous at best and dangerous at worst. There's only around 200,000 Jews in Germany today. 

You are absolutely fixated on your disdain for the Israeli state. Fine, you don't like their policy, congratulations. But this doesn't change the fact that outside of Israeli policy there is still a problem.

Your defensive posture on this issue isn't appealing. No one is labeling all Germans as antisemites. No one is saying that Germans today are responsible for the Holocaust. You don't have to accept personal responsibility for the Holocaust nor do you have to agree with all Israeli policy but to deny the existence of antisemitism in Germany, like you're attempting, is fucking stupid.

Well true, but Europe is not a fiscal union yet and it has a central bank which is very reluctant to do anything, unlike the American and Japanese one.

&gt; The idea is the following: showing investors that we really want to behave in the future will help us already in the closer future  

This works if your GDP doesn't fall like a rock due to the austerity, otherwise what investors see is a debt to GDP ratio that will get progressively worse.  
   
That's why I said in my first post that austerity doesn't work if everyone's doing it because you have nowhere to grow to while your internal market is depressing, and, doing so, be able to maintain or even grow your GDP during austerity, much like Germany did during the good times while it's neighbours were doing expansionary policies.  
  
Anyway, if I am understanding this right, it seems we both agree.

Sadly, people are *very* racist there.While I haven't had any problems personally  the 2 times I went there (other than the mad driving and occasional asshole-behavior because my car ID plate was not from around), I have a ridiculously long list of people who have been attacked, verbally or physically,  or got very shitty service or racist comments / attitudes from (ironically) people who are immigrants / descendants of immigrants. The acquaintances concerned were  japanese, swedish, american and german, and even french people from the north .
Also, 1st city for crime in France. 
Anyway, it's up to you but I wouldn't go there - if you want to visit a nice city around there aim for Aix en Provence or Nice (more in the east) or Montpellier (more in the west).

Also, Normandy and Bretagne beaches and cities / villages have a unique charm, while the beaches in the south are very packed and more ... ""bling bling"" ? Think california except it's hard to find a place to park your car, the beach is small, and you sometimes struggle to find a place to put your towel (no kidding!).

They're fast and cheap (by european standards). 1st class is sometimes available at very good prices if you order in advance , for instance 40 euros for Paris to Montpellier !

Cost should be around 150 euros for gas + toll (100 for gas) till Marseille.
Another tip : If you actually drive around, take a day to visit the Mont Saint Michel (I guess 100km from Caen or something) , and on your way to the south, maybe sleep somewhere nice, Rocamadour maybe ? 
There are plenty of very nice options. I suggest google maps to get the names of the areas you ll go through, and then some online guides to get a description of what to do / see there. And eat. Oh my god, the food. You're not far from Perigord for instance, ""Foie Gras""-land :-) 

It's a pretty long trip, probably somewhere around 10 hours, so a stop somewhere in the middle would be good I guess.

As for speaking French, it's definitely a problem, but here's a good tip :
French people don't like to not be good at something. It's unlikely that they really don't *know* how to speak english, but likely they just don't want to look stupid.
If you learn 2 or 3 sentences ""Pardonnez-moi je ne parle pas Francais"" or something similar, they'll be much more comfortable giving it a try.

Say anything against them, bam, you're anti-semitic. Just not to be it I then would have to say that Germans have to change. Well, now I'm anti-German. I can't win this.

So I'm throwing all Jewish into one bag? Big deal. We are having this conversation because of the latest study about anti-semitism in Germany. Anti-semitism means people don't like/hate Jews. Not a particular Jewish person, not a sub group, no, all of them. Yes I know that the definition of ""who is a Jew"" is not easy, but you can't have a discussion about these topics if you constantly pick individuals or have to relativize each statement. That argument is pure semantics and if you go by that standard you could rip apart that article and study altogether.

I don't assume that Jews are in a bad standing. That's the view of 20% of the German population according to the study. And no, I didn't say that it's their fault. Certainly not every Jew is pointing the finger at Germans. The Central Council of Jews is. And that's what shown in the media. 0.1% of all German citizens are Jewish. It's a very small minority and they have a pretty loud lobby.  

Anyway, keep believing that I'm anti-semitic. I know I'm not. Alike a lot of Germans I'm neutral to everyone unless they give me reason to like or not like them.

Cela obscurcit le débat qui devrait être conduit sur les points importants, à savoir entre autres :


1. Des missions de police (surveillance et collection de preuves) et de justice (sanctions) puissent être confiées aux acteurs privés, contournant ainsi l'autorité judiciaire et le droit à un procès équitable.

2. ACTA autorisera les ayants-droits à obtenir des données privées en provenance des utilisateurs de fournisseurs d'accès Internet sans décision préalable d'un juge. 

3. La directive crée une obligation pour les fournisseurs de services Internet de divulguer les informations personnelles de leurs clients aux industries du divertissement lors de poursuites judiciaires de personnes soupçonnées de partages d'œuvres protégées sur Internet.

4. Article 27.28 : Cette référence aux « moyens distribution massive (widespread distribution) de contrefaçon » est très inquiétante. Elle pourrait être interprétée comme moyen de justifier la mise en place de mesures criminalisant indirectement les plateformes de blogs, les réseaux P2P, le logiciel libre, et d'autres technologies contribuant à la diffusion de la culture et de la connaissance sur Internet.

Vieux Nice is gorgeous and will have all the brightly colored houses and narrow cobble stone streets people think of.

As for (good) workers, they have the duty to make sure everything's fine, regulating traffic, and help out customers whenever it's needed. I guess there are also security reasons, such as making sure that people get to the exit as quickly and effortlessly as possible in case of fire.

Another reason for workers to get freaked out is you passing when they are counting their money. From fear of stealing maybe, but also because they don't want to start to count their change again. You need to be focused and seeing someone passing in front of you for no reason while you're closed is pretty troubling.

I am originally American, but have lived in the Czech Republic for 5 years. It is really interesting to see the things most Americans don't have, but which people here take for granted. The Czech Republic is below the European average in terms of wealth, but we have one of the most egalitarian societies in the world. Anyone can work one job and live very comfortably, no one worries about how they will afford college or healthcare, and you know that even if you are out of work for a few months, you won't end up on the street. The same cannot be said for life in America, the world's richest country.

 * Die Positionen gehen einfach auseinander. Wenn z.B. eine Demonstration gegen ACTA implizit auch eine gegen Copyright an sich ist, werden sich einige gut überlegen ob sie da mitziehen. ACTA ist schlecht, unabhängig von der Urheberrechtebatte.

 * Gebt der Industrie blos nicht die Chance ACTA-Gegner mit Urheberrechtsverletzern gleichzusetzen. Leichter kann man es denen nicht machen.

 * Eigentlich Teil des vorherigen Punktes, bekommt aber einen eigenen zur Hervorhebung: Die Wahl des Schlachtfelds ist ein enormer Vorteil. Die Urheberrechtsdebatte ist nicht das Schlachtfeld auf dem ACTA einfach geschlagen werden kann, vor allem nicht wenn man sich stattdessen auf den intransparenten Prozess und insbesondere die Überwachung des Datenverkehrs durch ISPs konzentrieren kann.

 * Stell dir vor, du siehst einen Flyer oder Banner. Das Logo ist das erste dass du wahrnimmst. Erst danach liest du *vielleicht* die Tagline, dann entscheidest du dich erst ob du dich weiter informierst. Es sollte beim Logo also möglichst vermittelt werden, dass es der Aufmerksamkeit von Otto Normalverbraucher bedarf, und der hat mit Copyright nichts am Hut. Mit Überwachung und Hinterzimmermauscheleien hingegen schon.

Desweiteren kann es meiner Meinung nach nicht schaden da die EU rein zu bringen. Nur als Beispiel: ""Kein ACTA in der EU!"" Einfach und unoriginell wie es auch sein mag, vermittelt zwar überhaupt nicht worum es geht, wohl aber das es um etwas grosses geht dass jeden angeht, und spricht sowohl Euroskeptiker als auch Europhile an (also jeden). Es spricht auch insbesondere EU Parlamentarier an, da sich erstens endlich mal jemand für sie interessiert, und es zweitens aus der ACTA Abstimmung etwas macht dass der öffentlichen Wahrnehmung der EU entweder schadet (intransparente Entscheidungsfindung), oder sie verbessert (guter Verbraucherschutz).

Als Hauptaussage würde ich mich auf zwei, *maximal* drei Schwerpunkte beschränken. Die von dir genannten sind dabei genau die die ich hervorheben würde.

Die Argumente müssen in ihrer Präsentation einigen Tests stand halten. Zum einen müssen sie beide Zielgruppen ansprechen (breite Masse, auch technisch nicht interessierte, und Abgeordnete), zum anderen dürfen sie nicht leicht angreifbar sein. Zwei gute Argumente mit einem etwas wackeligen/überzogenen bedeutet dass die Lobbyisten die Diskussion auf das letztere lenken und damit die Gegenbewegung als überzogene Panikmache zu diskreditieren versuchen werden. Siehe oben bezüglich der Wahl des Schlachtfelds. 

Das große Argument der Befürworter, neben der Sache ansich, ist dass sich ja sowieso nichts ändern würde. Dem kann man entgegensetzen dass die zwangsweise Erhebung von Providern zu Hilfssheriffs sehr wohl nicht der gegenwärtigen Praxis entspricht, einer Abweichung von der Unschuldsvermutung gleich kommt, und Aufgaben der Strafverfolgungsbehörden auf die private Wirtschaft abwälzt. Die selbst finden das übrigens auch [nicht gut](http://www.bitkom.org/de/themen/55269_65039.aspx) und haben Ansprechpartner mit denen man über sowas reden kann.

Einen guten Ansatzpunkt finde ich die ""europäischen Werte"" die es hier zu bewahren gilt. Das spricht sowohl die breite Masse als auch die Europaabgeordneten an, zumal die EU ja wohl nicht ""der Amerikanischen Wirtschaft seine Bitch"" ist, ""oder?""  
Was hier natürlich eine Rolle spielt ist die gegenwärtige Eurokrise. Die hat natürlich nichts mit ACTA zu tun, kann aber durchaus beeinflussen wie das Europaparlament abstimmt. Die Abgeordneten finden die EU nämlich gut und wollen dass das Volk das auch tut, da waren die letzten Monate nicht gerade hilfreich. Man muss ihnen also ACTA als alternatives europäisches Thema anbieten, und ihnen damit die Gelegenheit geben den Bürgern zu zeigen dass die EU für die Menschen arbeitet, und nicht für die Industrie.

65 % against shoes off

So, it it obviously debatable and handled differently by different people. Factors might be class (""from rich to punks"") but also other demographic factors. Only because it's the norm in your demographic, cultural and regional environment, it doesn't make it the norm for all Germans.

Still it might be a stereotype and don't argue against that. And I didn't earlier.

I swear I didn't copy this list from an Estland's Department of Online Brand Building and Tourism Enhancement database or something. :D Just some articles I've ran into lately that have surprised me. 

Personally, the biggest reason I can give is the fact that common sense is still relatively common around these lands, compared to Western-Europe in general, where people seem to become somewhat ""soft"". Eastern-Europe's past has changed people, given them a slight ""reality-check"". If you don't know what I'm talking about, imagine Russia for a moment, most of the time they seem like too dangerous/rough/wild-wild-west/etc. Well, if Russia is on one end of the spectrum, representing the ""life is tough"" side, and France is the other side representing the side where young people live with their parents till they're 28 with no plans for life, then Eastern-Europe will be a nice combination of the two where things are ""normal"". And Eastern-Europe divides into sections too, Northern and Central area probably being the softest, I suppose, and places like Ukraine the toughest. I'm sure when years pass we too will become over-protective of everything. One good example I have is how in the West kids used to roam around, play on the street a lot, be gone for the whole day and then come back home when it's dinner time, now over-protecting children has resulted in a situation where in US kids under 12 age are not allowed to ever be alone without supervision, it's even illegal to leave them alone at home and your neighbors call the cops too, you have to get a babysitter (not even an older sister/brother who's not an adult will matter).

En France on parle bien du marseillais, du normand, du picard. Est-ce bien des langues à part entières ? Des dialectes ? Il y a toute une continuité de langues, certaines très proches du français, certaines très lointaines, et pour moi, seul les experts sont ceux qui ont le droit de couper cette continuité, avec d'un côté les dialectes et de l'autre une langue à part entière. Dans les faits, dans les classifications officielles publiées par divers instituts nationaux, ce genre de séparation existe, mais il faut garder à l'esprit à quelle distance de la coupure chaque langue considérée est, pour éviter de passer pour un pédant comme l'amie de Zaion.

Edit 2 jours plus tard:

1. Je vois qu'aucun n'ait répondu par un simple Oui ou un Non. 

Un défaut de protestation ou d'opposition est un signe d'acquiescement mais allez, péché avoué à moitie pardonné...

2. Ce n'est pas le choix de la préposition utilisée qui est troublant à mes oreilles.

3. Les gens de peu d'éducation - cela se passe de commentaires.

4. chauffeur qui chauffe - oui mais non, lire + bas.

Je vais vous donner sur quoi mordre, si le coeur vous en dit, chers cousins d'outre-Atlantique, mais pour moi la messe est dite :

La phrase citée est restée grave dans ma mémoire. Elle a été prononcée lors d'une soirée multi-culturelle organisée à Kamakura, près de Tokyo. Soirée consacrée à l'échange français-japonais. La discussion à bifurqué vers ce que rend le Japon agréable à vivre, et nous avons comparé le commerce de proximité. Le petit arabe du coin en France, les supérettes ouvertes 24/7 au Japon essaimées partout. 

Une des québécoises présentes à avancé le commentaire que vous lisez. Heureusement nous avons pu éclaircir ce qu'elle voulait dire sans que personne ne se fâche.

**Conduire la nuit pour aller faire une course urgente pourrait être dangereux.**

Nous avons donc à considérer: 

A l'époque des locomotives à vapeur il y avait bien un chauffeur dont la tache consistait à lancer des pelletées de charbon dans la chaudière. C'est le conducteur qui conduisait.

En anglais la transformation verbe-nom est bidirectionnelle (je m'avance en terrain inconnu, là) :  **drive &lt;-&gt; driver**. Possible que les québécois aient adopté **chauffeur -&gt; chauffer** pour indiquer l'action que nous, en français, décrivons par **conduire**.

**dans le noir** se passe de commentaire il me semble.

Les supérettes ouvertes tard la nuit ""depannent"", d'accord, on y va pour acheter un produit que l'on avait oublié lors des courses au supermarché ou venait à être épuisé. Pourtant **dépanneur** en français indique la personne qui remédie à une panne, de voiture en général. Il vient enlever la bagnole tombée en panne sur le bord de l'autoroute.

D'ailleurs c'est bien ce ""dépanneur"" qui avait attiré mon attention, si la bagnole est en panne comment est-ce qu'on peut ""aller chez le depanneur""?!!

They support great causes, getting signatures from hundreds of thousands of online supporters worldwide on petitions which they present to the appropriate governments. Once you've registered you get emails (relatively infrequently, and only once per subject) describing an issue and asking for your signature on the petition. By simply quick-clicking your email into a text box, you can fire off a ready-made message and support some of the best causes internationally, right from your very own computer chair.

Once, when I was unemployed, I started getting unemployment checks from the government. I told my dad about it and he asked ""Are you humiliated?"" and I said ""Kind of embarrassing, yeah."" to which he replied ""Good. You should be.""

He wasn't being mean-spirited here. It is just that to Americans, expecting someone else to take care of you is kinda shameful.

In a wider sense, Americans traditionally distrust the very idea of government and want it to have as little power in their lives as possible. It is arrogant to think of it as ""Our way is the only civilized way."".

As someone pretty economically conservative (but not Ron Paul-libertarian), I see this as a common fallacy among liberals.

I believe free market makes things better for everyone in the long run and I think welfare, however well-meaning, tends to be a shot in the foot. Sure, there is also an ideological component of individualism but it is secondary.

In other words, the fundamental disagreement between liberals and conservatives is not about empathy or lack thereof, but about what the most effective way to improve common good is.

1. Bringing more ethnic minorities into the police forces: would be good and desireable, but is a long term effort, which doesn't help the current riots.

2. Making policing more attractive to a changing population and making the population fear police by escalating force, arming them with rubber bullets, taser, pepper spray and water cannons: the idea of escalating force would be problematic if the root of the crime problem is people being *left behind*.

This is a more nuanced response than ""why learn from the Americans?"". Also, the idea being immediately ""shot down"" doesn't fit as a description of the reaction that actually happened: ""We want to use the advice of people like Bill Bratton to really tackle some of the deep-seated social issues like gang culture.""

EDIT: My personal opinion is that police can not solve the underlying problems, but police can help hiding some of the symptoms. But you have to watch carefully that you don't promote the underlying problems in the process, both by making those problems seemingly less urgent, just because police is so ""tough"", that we don't see the symptoms anymore, as well as by increasing the buffer between those that apparantly need protection from crime, because they have a lot, and those who are likely to commit crime, because they don't have a lot.

This is the [original german article](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,811817,00.html) (they have attached the letter of the italian ambassador at the end).

It was worse than I expected. I would consider it Bild-level, if it weren't for the somewhat longer sentences... It evolves ""brilliantly"" from ""Schettino was Italian"" to ""Italian culture is inferior"" and uses it to support his main point: *Geburtsfehler des Euro? Die Zwangsjacke für verschiedene Kulturen* (The problems of the Euro since its creation? It's a straitjacket for different Cultures).

Specially remarkable parts:

&gt; Kann man sich vorstellen, dass ein solches Manöver inklusive sich anschließender Fahrerflucht auch einem deutschen oder, sagen wir lieber, britischen Schiffsführer unterlaufen wäre?

Could someone imagine a German, or better, British Captain doing such a manouver and then escaping from the ship?

&gt; Man kennt diesen Typus aus dem Strandurlaub: ein Mann der großen Geste und sprechenden Finger. Im Prinzip harmlos, man sollte ihn nur nicht zu nahe an schweres Gerät lassen, wie sich zeigt. ""Bella figura"" machen, heißt der italienische Volkssport, bei dem es darum geht, andere zu beeindrucken.

You know this people from the holidays at the beach. A man that gesticulates a lot and [has fingers that speak]*. Mostly harmless, if you don't let him near heavy machinery, as this [case] shows. The Italian national sport is to do ""bella figura"", and the point of it is impressing others. 
*I suppose that's and idiom, but I don't know how to translate it.

&gt; Mit dem Nationalcharakter verhält es sich wie mit dem Geschlechterunterschied. Eigentlich ist er längst abgeschafft, aber im Alltagsleben stoßen wir trotzdem ständig auf ihn.

The National Character is like the Gender differences. They were theoretically  abolished long ago, but we constantly keep on bumping against them.



This is the [italian one](http://www.ilgiornale.it/interni/lettera_ai_tedeschi/27-01-2012/articolo-id=568980-page=0-comments=1l).

They criticise the whole article about the accident, but specially that opinion column. ""We are not a country of cowards"". Then they compare the accident with the holocaust (at least they managed to save 4k people in the accident).

&gt; Secondo Der Spiegel siamo un popolo di Schettino e non c’è da meravigliarsi di ciò che è successo al largo del Giglio. Di più: siamo tutte persone da evitare, un peso per l’Europa, un ostacolo allo sviluppo della moneta unica.

According to Der Spiegel we are a land of Schetinos and it's not surprising what happened in Giglio. We all are persons to avoid, a dead weigh for Europa and an obstacle for the common currency.

&gt; Per la loro bravura e superiorità hanno fatto scoppiare due guerre mondiali che per due volte hanno distrutto l’Europa. Fanno i gradassi ma hanno finito di pagare (anche all’Italia) solo un anno fa (settembre 2010) il risarcimento dei danni provocati dal primo conflitto: 70 milioni di un debito che era di 125 miliardi. Ci hanno messo 92 anni e nel frattempo anche noi poverelli li abbiamo aiutati prima a difendersi dall’Unione Sovietica, poi a pagare il conto dell’unificazione delle due Germanie.

For their bravery and superiority there were 2 World Wars, that destroyed Europe two times. They are bullies that a year ago they finished to pay the compensations for the damage caused in the first conflict: 70 millions of a debt of 125 milliards. It took 92 years, and in the meantime we beggars have helped them defend themselves against the Soviet Union and pay the bill for the reunification of Germany.

&gt; Questi tedeschi sono ancora oggi arroganti e pericolosi per l’Europa. Se Dio vuole non tuonano più i cannoni, ma l’arma della moneta non è meno pericolosa. Per questo non dobbiamo vergognarci. Noi avremmo pure uno Schettino, ma a loro Auschwitz non gliela toglierà mai nessuno.

These Germans are today arrogant and dangerous for Europe. Hopefully not because of the cannons, but the weapon of the currency is not less dangerous. We shouldn't take shame for this [the accident].

**SPON column, the black channel** [The black channel used to be a communist propaganda show in East-Germany, but is also the traditional color of our conservatives, hence, teh trolling is programmatic]

**Italian Hit-and-Run**

A column by Jan Fleischhauer

The character of peoples is an invention of yesterday, we already learn at school that clichees about nations have been put out-of-service. But is that so? Untimely thoughts on occasion of the 
odyssey of an Italian captain.

Be honest: Is anyone surprised that the disaster-captain of the ""Costa Concordia"" is Italian? Can anybody imagine, that such a maneuver including subsequent hit-and-run would have happened to a
German or let's say, British captain?

One knows this type from the beach vacation: a man with large gestures and speaking fingers. Harmless in principle, but you shouldn't let him handle heavy machinery, as it show. Making ""Bella figura"" is
an Italian mass sport, which is all about impressing others. Francesco Schettino wanted to make a good figure, too, unfortunately, there was a rock in his way.

Okay, this was very incorrect. We have been long been stopped to reach for cultural stereotypes in judgment of our neighbors. This is regarded as hillbilly, or worse racist (although, it is not totally clear how the Italian is its own race).

The national character is like the difference between the genders. Technically, it has already been abandoned, but in every day life, we encounter it all the time. You just have to spend an afternoon in the Kindergarten, to doubt everything the enlightened pedagogy teaches about gender as social construct. Actually, a whole shadow industry lives off the difference of Mars and Venus [oh the irony to cite teh roman gods here] and how to best cope with it. The counterpart to such efforts is the travel guide, which introduces us to the peculiarities and therefor typology of foreign cultures.

**Somehow, medially, the Hun is still in us**

Especially the Germans have a problem with cultural attributions. The Brit, for example, don't think we're exceptionally gifted in humor -- in spite of comic giants like Mario Barth [popular yet pretty unfunny German comedian] or, attention political satire, Hagen Rether. The French then again make fun of the English cuisine and the Belgians about the alleged stinginess of the dutch.

We only now the character of people in its negative variant, as self-accusation. The minute some youths shout stupid slogans, conflict scientist Wilhelm Heitmeyes surfaces in the press and explains
why social peace is in danger (""explosive situation"") and that a relapse is coming any moment now.

Some how the Hun is medially still with us, ready to strike; somehow that always works.

One doesn't have to try genetics to get to the view that nations differ. There are climatic reasons for it, language plays a role, too. Usually this is not very important, one shouldn't try to justify policies by claiming that borders only matter in indirectly. The currency crisis, which got ignored in the last weeks because the man in the castle [German press was very busy with a scandal surrounding our president] grabbed everyones attention, shows what happens if one ignores the psychology of a people for political reasons. The rock in front of the ship is here the interest
rate of the market.

**Birth-defect of the Euro? The straight-jacket for different cultures**

When there's talk about the different capacity of countries everywhere now, it's a way of saying how certain clichees have a justification in a way that strips off all offense. The birth defect of the 
Euro was to force different cultures into the straitjacket of a common currency.

To recognize how this couldn't have succeeded one did not have to study political economy, a visit in Napoli or Peloponnese would have been enough. Now one is looking imploringly for a solution. The answer of the chancelorette is to make everyone like us; one will see how far she gets with that.

Nations can change, therein lies consolation if one wants to see it. The Italians commanded a world empire 2000 years ago which reached from England to Africa. The Germans are now struggling to keep
trains running in snow and ice. It takes a long time for some clichees wear off. Sometimes it takes generations.

Schneider believes that ""Kids ought to be assisted to develop and experience their sexuality sensually"".

This is damn fucking important, especially when it comes to resisting molesters, most of which don't apply force (and won't, if opposed), but exploit their position as adult authority and kids' lack of practice in applied sexual self-determination, and certainty about their right to it. Parents allowing aunts etc. to cross the line of comfort by mere kissing don't help either, btw. Kids have a tendency to override their will when it comes to securing their own survival, which means continued affection by adults, and can use all help, and pledges/implications of continued support, necessary when it comes to asserting absolute lines.

It's of course also through-ball for the moralisers, who, as always, don't care about the kids but about morals...
