Tonight I have been threatened with being fired for asking my employer to pay my overtime hours. The explanation that I got was that ""You're not even in the top 30% people with extra hours so why are you complaining, it's pretty easy to get rid of people in Switzerland.""

I have just come out of my trial period of 3 months with this employer and have 100 hours of overtime. I have checked several [Swiss webpages related to employment law](https://www.ch.ch/en/overtime-and-extra-hours/) and the general consensus is that you can't do more than a determined number of extra hours per day and no more than ~150 per year. My work contract states that I can ask for my extra hours to be compensated as free days (which I was told are actually on-call days and if I am called I have to be in the office in one hour) or money - both things being in accordance with Swiss law.

I obviously don't want to print out the Swiss employment law chapter related to overtime and slam it on my employer's desk but i do have several questions as I am new to working in Switzerland:

* Did you ever have an Employer threaten you for wanting your overtime hours compensated?
* What's your opinion on the situation and how would you handle it?
* Do you have overtime hours and do they get compensated?
* Is it really that easy to fire someone in Switzerland?

Thank you.

Best regards,
Alex

I do have some issues with backing out on ethical grounds, but I can't reasonably turn down the new offer because it is so much better than the old one. I'd basically have to work at the company I signed with for several years to get to a position that is even comparable to the one I was offered in the meantime. 

This usually wouldn't be a big issue, but the company I signed with does not have a ""Probezeit"". That means I'd have to give 4 weeks notice rather than the usual 1 week, and I am not convinced the new offer will be around that long.

I've been living in the US for a few years with my family and we're thinking about returning to Switzerland now. We need to change cars now anyway, and given the price difference between where we live (California) and Switzerland, it feels like it could be a good idea to buy one and bring it back with us. 

I've looked a bit through the forms that are required but it's incredibly confusing, and I'm afraid if we miss a key point we might end up having an unusable car because of some regulations we might miss.

So I'm wondering, do any of you have experience with this? Are there companies that do a good job with this and could help us avoid some hassle?

I've also heard stories of needing to own the vehicle for more than a given amount of time to avoid extra taxes, but I couldn't find that information anywhere... I've heard of anything from 6 to 12 months. We're planning on moving back in around one year if things go as planned.
