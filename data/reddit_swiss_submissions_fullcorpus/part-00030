Basically I'm wondering what sort of graduate program I should be looking for if I want to work for an intl org. Public policy? Nonprofit management?

I'm told that administrative work positions usually look for intl business students, and since administrative work is something that all intl orgs would need, that is why I am majoring in that as an undergrad.

Any input whatsoever would be very helpful/insightful.
