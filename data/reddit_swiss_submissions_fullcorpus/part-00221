Most of the official statsitics (population, employment etc.) in Switzerland mentions only males and females. I also don't remember noticing a third-gender option in any of the official forms (banks, insurances, kreisburo, etc..) that I have come across in the past 3-4 years. 

Any info in this regard is much appreciated.

Where are some good places to check out for potential future apartments? I'm mostly just looking to get a general feel for the area so I'm not flying blind if I'm shopping online later this Spring.
