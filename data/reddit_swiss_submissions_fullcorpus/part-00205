**Note**: *If there is anything I've missed (which I'm sure I have) please comment or PM me so I can add it!*

***

**Travel**

*Flying*

There are 3 main airports in Switzerland, **Zurich Airport** and **Geneva Airport**, as well as the tri-national **Basel/Mulhouse Airport** (sits on the French, Swiss and German border corner). 

* **Geneva Airport** is located in the south west, French speaking tip of Switzerland.

* **Zurich Airport** is located in the central/eastern areas of Switzerland.

* **Basel Airport** or as some call it **The Euro Airport** supplies central/western Switzerland. It's important to note that Basel is the European hub for EasyJet, meaning more routes as well as cheaper flights.

*Public Transport*

Switzerland is famed for it's railway and overall public transport, and there is good reason for it. You can quite nearly get *everywhere* in Switzerland via public transport, whether by boat, cable car, cog railway, train and bus.

Every airport is connected to this national circuit of transport, and as noted, so is the rest of Switzerland. You can use all services inside Switzerland with a single ticket called the Swiss Pass, although you can obviously get more direct tickets if you only plan on travelling to a few locations. It's important to note that you can travel all of Switzerland with the same pass, all the services are universal barring *very* few cable cars here and there. Ask at any information desk and they'll be willing to help, language will almost never be an issue, if so just point at a name if you really have to. Most people in Switzerland speak enough English to get by, or at least those working on the rail and such.

**Accommodation**

Nothing especially different to the rest of the world, although you may realise it's pretty expensive (as you'll find out, so is the rest of Switzerland). You will probably be able to book anywhere via the Internet, and booking in advance is recommended, planning is the key.

**Eating**

Just like accommodation, most restaurants will seem rather expensive compared to most countries, although you can find cheaper meals if you really want. The 2 major supermarket companies in Switzerland, **Migros** and **Coop** both offer their own restaurants at larger outlets, here you can get a big meal, usually a starter and main for roughly CHF 12-20. Other than that, it's up to you to find more reasonable prices. Generally, eating out is going to ultimately be expensive, so shopping and cooking is recommended if money is an issue.

**Mountains and Recreation**

Cable cars and cog railways will usually cost anything from CHF 15+ per person, and some are even closed during certain times of the year, so be sure to check the mountain specific websites when planning (these will 100% be in English or have an English option, as well as an Italian, French and German one)

* Summer months are great for walks, hiking, water sports such as canoeing and mountain biking.

* Winter months are great for snow shoeing, snow sports, oh, and the cities are beautiful this time of year especially.

**Roads**

If you hired a car, chances are they will explain this to you, but in Switzerland we drive on the right hand side, with the driving wheel on the left hand side. There are major road networks connecting towns and cities, however when driving in more mountainous regions (I.E. not central Switzerland) you'll be driving on smaller, winding roads.

**Language**

It was said earlier, but I'll add some more information here. In Switzerland, there are 4 *official* languages;

* German (most spoken, central, west and east Switzerland)

* Italian (spoken in the most southerly cantons of Switzerland)

* French (spoken in the most south westerly cantons of Switzerland)

* Romansh (least spoken, generally in the south east of Switzerland)

That said, English is widely spoken, I've never been somewhere and **had** to resort to German, although the Swiss will really appreciate it if you at least try (this will usually mean they try to help a but more if they see you're making an effort, even if it's just a greeting)

**Useful Phrases**

Just to note, I am by no means fluent in German, however I am sure and confident in my ability to speak it to get by, here are some **German** phrases I can muster;

* Grüezi - pronounced 'grootzee' with emphasis on the 'oo' which sounds like a 'u'. It means greeting, and basically everyone no matter who you are will say it as you pass, usually in shops and more residential places. You'll hear a few variations such as 'Grüezi Mitenand' which is basically 'greeting group/collection of people'

* Wie viel? - pronounced 'v feel', simply means 'how much?', this works well with pointing.

* Ich heisse - pronounced 'ik highser' means 'my name is' or 'I am'. Bonus points for replying with 'und dir?' which means 'and you' and is pronounced such as 'nd deer/dear'.

* Haben Sie ein? - pronounced 'ha ben see ine' simply means 'have you got a' then search for a word in a phrase book or point.

*Ideally try to learn some of the language relevant to the region of Switzerland you are travelling to.*

**Weather**

Weather in Switzerland tends to be unstable because of the close mountain ranges. Whenever you visit there's always a substantial chance for bad weather. It is thus recommended to have a somewhat flexible schedule: Visit the mountains when the forecast is good and have a few activities planned for when it's not. For example, visiting the old towns in Gruyere, Berne, Lucerne, Zurich and Locarno (among others), Museums (Fondation Beyeler, Basel; Kunsthaus Zürich; Rosengart Museum Lucerne) and castles (Lenzburg, Chateau Chillon in Montreux) are good ways to spend rainy days. Staying in Berne or Lucerne is a good way to have most of that in reach of a daily trip while being close enough to the mountains to make it there in time (get up really early!).

**Other information**

* Alcohol - Switzerland is not very different to most European countries. Beer and wine can be drunk at 16, however not all shops will sell at 16, i.e. Coop and Kiosk will not (Migros doesn't sell alcohol fullstop, but Denner does). Everything else is assumed 18+. 

* Marijuana - Marijuana is decriminalised, which here means anything under 10g is limited to a CHF100 fine, no court appearance or record. Saying that, as long as you're not selling and/or disrupting others, police will often turn a blind eye. Saying this, we don't suggest you break the law in the country you're visiting. ***Caution:*** Weed is pretty potent in comparison to most places, so please be careful. Most Europeans and Swiss tend to roll with tobacco for this reason.

So I had to leave the debate tonight a bit early and are thus not aware what happend during the discussion on ERASMUS and impact on students life. But I am 1) very unhappy about how the discussion went and 2) sure that some people could not express/formulate their opinion during the discussion so I thought reddit might be a good place to continue it.

Let me explain my first point: I am strongly against the initiative and I think I have my valid reasons (as most of you may have at this point). The pro side often spoke about how the initiative benefits a qualitative rather than a quantitative growth. And one comment on that was that EPFL has a similar approach with a numerus clausus (I support a NC in general, but with many points to discuss). In my opinion, this comparison doesn't hold, mainly because Ecopop is NOT a qualitative but a simple quantitative limitation. Nobody asks if the immigrants are skilled or not, we just limit them and if the boat is full it's full. This could lead to a race for workers, which leads ultimately to a decrease in their skill due to a ""first come fist serve"" mentality. We don't look for the best, we take what we can get. This is fudamentally different to what a Numerus Clausus does. Not to speak of the fact that I'm against ""only letting the best in"", because education on paper doesn't mean skilled/""beneficial for the country"" an vice versa. Secondly I think and this has been mentioned more than once, that migration is not a Swiss, but a European or global problem. We have a brain drain in poorer countries (check what's going on for example in Hungary) from which Switzerland profits, and yet we are complaining that we are the ones which have a problem with global migration? 
I found particularly interesting the idea to make constructive initiatives on how to limit emissions (e.g. the limitation of secondary residencies in the mountains was a step in a more sustainable direction) instead of inscribing a strict limitation IN OUR CONSTITUTION! As an engineer I think that the organisation of our country and the world depends on a multitude of parameters (too many to even get started on them) and that bluntly fixing one if these parameters once and for all is not going to help... it just makes our controller worse. 
I'm not gonna talk about the additional aspect of the initiative to just send more money to Africa to teach them not to make babies, because thats's an idea that shows such arrogancy that I just don't know how to express my anger about this ""offer we make to the third world""... Again, not saying that supporting third world countries is not necessary and good (although that's also a long discussion), but simply how it's offered as a solution to the world's problems in this context makes me wanna throw up of disgust.

This is my opinion and I am really scared of the outcome of this vote, because I think it may influence our future in ways we cannot forsee yet. I don't think that we can't cope with the problems of migration, but we can't tell what's gonna happen if we destroy our bonds with the EU and give up our humanitary and neutral tradition by bluntly telling the world: ""we are the best, fuck the rest"".

Looking forward to comments, just give it to me, I can take it, I'm a grown man my momma says ;)

I requested that my partner get a full test, and he came back with just the HIV test, saying that the clinic told him he didn't need to be tested given his history (even though it involves multiple random partners, with condoms).
I disagree with this. Condoms are not foolproof, and they are not always used correctly. It also seems wrong to me for a clinic to turn a patient away who is requesting a screening. I worked at a University clinic back in the U.S., and we had 2-3 patients coming in every day testing positive for Chlamydia, and around 1 every day testing positive for gonorrhea. Given that a percentage of those infected are asymptomatic, it's easy to see how it's spread. But it's fairly easy to find clinics in the U.S. with free or reduced price STD testing. It's pretty routine and common over there to get tested, and people are encouraged to get screened yearly if they aren't married/monogamous. 
Sorry for my lack of education about this issue in Switzerland, but my German is still bad so it's really difficult for me to do research. Are the STI rates in Europe just so low that it isn't a concern for most people? (can you point me in the direction of some certified statistics about this?).
