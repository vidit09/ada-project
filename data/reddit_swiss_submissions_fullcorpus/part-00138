I even love the intermissions halfway through movies. I like the Swiss people whom I have found to be more resourceful, thoughtful and hard-working than any other place I have lived.

Right now I have to say I'm feeling incredibly betrayed and personally hurt by the outcome of yesterday's vote on curbing immigration from EU. Since I moved here, I have contributed, in yearly taxes, about 300% of what an average Swiss person would pay. I say 'merci' instead of 'danke'. I never got as much as a noise-complaint. The industry that hired me, which is hi-tech, is crucial to this country's future prosperity. And yet, yesterday, more than half of the Swiss people have basically said to me, we don't care about any of this, we don't want your kind here.

As it stands, the law in Switzerland would already have me living here for 12 years before I could /apply/ for Swiss citizenship. I want you to consider that for a moment: 12 years is about one fifth of an average person's life. Imagine yourself 12 years ago. Now imagine the span of time in between then and now. That's a substantial part of your life. Now imagine that after those 12 years, someone can invalidate all of that - your friends, your loved ones, your god damn life - by saying ""no, you don't belong here.""

To those who voted Yes yesterday: your country was made successful by immigration. Your economic prosperity today is due, in large part, to those who took a chance, moved to a country where they didn't know the language or the customs, and worked on something great. Then think again whether you want to go on spitting in their face.

I am a productive member of this society. I am getting tired of being told I don't belong here.

Obviously I won't have any issue working at home having a Swiss passport.

Thing is, she doesn't speak any German (yet), except the odd formalities that I have taught her. So speaking perfect mother tongue English is really going to be her greatest asset. We're both graduating with a Bachelor of Arts and Sciences, and she's really interested in design (like functionality vs beauty kind of thing. Half of this is trying to figure out what we want to do job wise anyway :-) ). So we're hoping that you kind folks here might have any suggestions where she could start to look for jobs that include her English skill. I've read through some other posts, but people there seem to have it figured out as in what industry they are looking for jobs in.

I would love to hear from other people's experiences, and would appreciate any links to websites you think might help us out here. I'm not asking about visa too much, because my understanding is you need a job in order to apply for visa.

After long research and consideration I've decided to move to Switzerland about a year ago.
The plan I decided on would take awhile, but I thought it was my best bet and it's already set into motion with full speed: 

* finish BSc in my home country (EU), while learning german
* go to ETH for MS degree in a field that's high in demand
* find a job in the studied field in Zurich afterwards
* apply for citizenship after 12 years

12 years waiting period seemed a bit harsh, but I was willing to pay my dues because Switzerland seemed worth it.

But this quota referendum makes me very sad and re-consider moving elsewhere, assuming I understood it correctly - hopefully not!

So here's the actual questions:

* Assuming I succesfully finish the studies at ETH and find an employer, will I still have to go through the quota stuff and if I don't ""win the lottery"" then I'll be kicked out?
* Assuming I get the permit (for 1 year?) will I have to participate in the lottery each following period? 
* Will previous ""performance"" like taxes, not breaking laws, learning the language etc affect it at all?

Since 2008 I have held a B permit with no lapses thanks to my Mothers job but I would really like to transfer this to a C, as soon as possible. I have fulfilled the time requirements as far as I can tell and because I spent 5 years between the age of 10-20 I have heard this actually counts as double (?) so I may have well cleared the time barrier. I have no other reason for them to deny me a C permit such as breaking laws and such and I have taken enough German to manage my way around the streets (by no means could I do the Passport interview at my current level). I am also an American citizen meaning EU/EFTA automatic transfer does not apply to me. I think that covers all the relevant information.
