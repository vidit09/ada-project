Newbie to CERN here. I say new, I've been here 3 months now and I thought I'd see if I could get any good tips out of you all. I'm getting very tired having left my family, and girlfriend of 4 years, behind in England and staying in my flat is driving me a bit crazy. The first thing I noticed about Geneva, and Switzerland is how expensive everything is! My first month was a record spend and painful on the poor old bank account. Since then I have been nudging it down slowly, with decisions such as the year long travelcard for under 25's, but it still feels real pricey. Sometimes up to 100CHF/week in just food if I'm not careful. I'd like to be going out more and doing things but I'm terrified of how much it might cost me! CERN pay well, but I'm booking semi-regular flights home to England and it strains money quite tight sometimes.

So, any tips of good stuff to do that doesn't hold a massive price tag? I was at the Escalade race and celebration the week after which were great fun. Do more things like that happen that I should miss? If so, when? I'm a big snowboarding fan, but again, unsure of how to do this without spending too much here. Haven't been for a while but if there are some clubs and such I'd love to be involved. Cheers for any info, its much appreciated.

I've been enrolled in civil protection (cause I'm half-inapt), not civil service, and I have like 2 weeks to do in 2012.

I've overheard some guy in the train telling his friend that he had not been to his 2 weeks, and had received a phone call telling him he was late. He told them ""I'm not going, I have to work"" and they just told him ""okay then you'll pay the full tax"" (which is 3% of the income, 400 CHF minimum)

My question is : is that true ? If you're working or not willing to go, can you just skip it and pay, or are there bad consequences ?

First post from a reddit lurker here, but I could use some advice. I'm a Belgian Computer Sciences student coming to EPFL as an exchange student for the spring semester. 

-I had put my name on the FMEL waiting list the day it opened (somewhere in March if I remember correct) and when calling a few months ago they ensured me I would get a room. However, this week I was told all rooms were gone and I didn't get one. I've sent emails to about 10-12 ads I found on Anibis.ch and the EPFL-UNIL logement website but only got 2 (negative) responses. I wrote all of them in English, as I feel more confident writing English then French, could this scare of people? What should I do differently?

-How bike friendly is the town (bicycle paths, theft, etc)? I've heard conflicting things about this, but I'ld love to bring my bicycle to Lausanne.

-Any other things I should know before leaving Belgium?
