* Obligatory Referendum on reproductive medicine and genetic engineering in humans. This would legalize testing IVF embryos for inherited diseases before implanting them in the uterus if there are risk factors for such diseases.

* Stipend Initiative. This would transfer the Cantons' right to determine who gets stipends and how high those stipends are to the Confederation, while leaving implementation to the Cantons. The initiative committee estimates that it would result in additional stipend payments of 500 million CHF per year.

* Estate Tax Initiative. This would abolish Cantonal estate taxes and introduce a 20% Federal tax on cumulative estates and bestowals above 2 million CHF; two thirds of the revenue would go to the AHV/AVS, one third would go to the Cantons. The changes would be retroactive to 2012. Spouses and registered partners would not be subject to the tax; however, children would be.

* Facultative referendum on changes to the TV and Radio Law. The changes expand annual TV and radio fees to households without physical radios and TVs, as well as to companies. Cost per household/company would be CHF 400 instead of the current CHF 462 for households with radios or TVs.

Before I post my itinerary, I have some basic (non-basic?) questions:

1.  I have a 15-day Swiss Travel Pass - How can I get the most out of it?  I understand museum (all?) admission is free?  Also, some ""special"" trains such as the Golden Round Trip is 50% off, correct?

2. Which banks or ATMs are safest to use in Switzerland?  I plan on withdrawing CHF as soon as I land in Zurich airport, do I need to be careful of certain ATMs?

3. What are some good lunch recommendations within Zurich airport?  I will have to take the train to Appenzell as soon as I land, and I'm sure I will be hungry.

My Itinerary:

1. Fly into Zurich in the morning, buy a Swisscom simcard, grab a quick bite, then head to Appenzell.
I will stay in Appenzell for one night.  I planned on hiking this trail:

http://www.ebenalp.ch/de/sommer/wanderkarte/route-8 (the forecast says that it will rain, but that won't stop me from hiking!)

I'm sure it will be foggy and cloudy, but I will try to head to St. Gallen during the evening for a stroll around town.

Before I post my itinerary, I have some basic (non-basic?) questions:

1.  I have a 15-day Swiss Travel Pass - How can I get the most out of it?  I understand museum (all?) admission is free?  Also, some ""special"" trains such as the Golden Round Trip is 50% off, correct?

2. Which banks or ATMs are safest to use in Switzerland?  I plan on withdrawing CHF as soon as I land in Zurich airport, do I need to be careful of certain ATMs?

3. What are some good lunch recommendations within Zurich airport?  I will have to take the train to Appenzell as soon as I land, and I'm sure I will be hungry.




My Itinerary:

**First leg (1 night) - Appenzell**:

Fly into Zurich in the morning, buy a Swisscom simcard, grab a quick bite, then head to Appenzell.
I will stay in Appenzell for one night.  I planned on hiking this trail:

http://www.ebenalp.ch/de/sommer/wanderkarte/route-8 (the forecast says that it will rain, but that won't stop me from hiking!)

I'm sure it will be foggy and cloudy, but I will try to head to St. Gallen during the evening for a stroll around town.  

**Second leg (3 nights) - Lucerne**:

Head to Lucerne in the afternoon; if the weather permits, I will walk around to see the usual attractions (I can skip the lion).  If the weather is still permits the next day, I will get on the Golden Round Trip.  All the attractions and and must-see was taken from wikitravel and a lonely planet book.  I've taken into account of all the tourist traps; can you recommend me something that *I CAN'T MISS in Lucerne?!*  Thank you!

**Third leg (4 nights) - Berne**:

This is probably the most complicated leg of my trip; I will be taking day trips from Berne to other parts of Switzerland.  I've scratched off Zermatt and Jungfraujoch off the list after a lot of consideration.  I would rather save the money and time to go somewhere else.  Again, all the basic attracions and must-see were taken from the fore mentioned resources.  

I plan on visiting Murten and Aveches after seeing everything in Berne.  I also plan on taking day trips from Berne to the following:

* Interlaken / Thun - this can be done in one day, correct?  I know how touristy Interlaken is and how people are underwhelmed, I don't have high expectations, *but is there a ""must-see?""* in Interlaken and Thun?

* Hiking in Grimmelwald / Murren - Hopefully the weather permits

* Lauterbrunnen Valley / Schilthorn - Trümmelbach Falls &amp; Staubbach Falls - Can this be done in one day with the above?(Grimmelwald / Murren)

**Fourth and final leg (3 nights) - Geneva**

The usually must-see and attractions in Geneva, again, *what can I NOT miss to see in Geneva*?  I will also be taking a few day trips from Geneva to:

* Montreux - Château de Chillon, Marmots' Paradise, Riviera Promenade, Montreux Vieille Ville
* Lausanne - *Suggestions?*
* Lake Geneva - *Suggestions?*

1. Is there anything else to be recommended for a day trip from Geneva?
2. What do you think of my itinerary?  Where can I improve?

Again, thank you so much for taking the time to read thru my post!

**EDIT** I forgot the ask the most important question!  What is a good Swiss brand chocolate that I can bring back to my friends and family?  I don't have money to bring back any Pateks, but what are some notable chocolates that won't cost too much?  Thank you!

I am on holiday in Switzerland and saw lots of military roaming the streets today (Sunday 5/17).  Some marching, some just walking in groups.  What was that about?  Some kind of military exercise?

Just curious...thanks!
