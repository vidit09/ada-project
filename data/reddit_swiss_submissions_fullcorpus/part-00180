Greetings from New York City, my next destination for vacation will be Switzerland.  I've done some minor research on this sub and online, but there are some questions that I couldn't find answers too.  Thank you in advance, and I appreciate your time!

* I wanted to travel at the end of November, but it seems like it might be too cold and some attractions might be closed due to weather, is this correct?  I then thought about it again and wanted to visit Switzerland at the end of April.  Is this a better idea?  Even though I will be a tourist, I hate being around other tourists.  I tend to travel in off-peak seasons.  I read that July and August are the busiest months, so I will avoid that like the plague.  If November is too cold then end of April, I assume, would be more pleasant.  Can you please advise?

* I saw others on this sub recommend a Flexi Swiss Rail Pass, I searched it and the 6-day pass is a little over $450 US.  I don't mind the price, but I will be in Switzerland for 10-days, do I need to purchase another 4-day pass?  Or will I need to plan around the 6-day pass to save money?

* Since I will be in Switzerland for 10-days, I want to make sure that I see the most I can, but I don't want to stretch myself out thin.  I have a list I've made for Switzerland:

1. Lugano
2. Locarne
3. Lucerne
4. Jungfraujoch
5. Seealpsee
6. Fribourg
7. Ticino
8. Gruyere
9. Montreux
10. Zermatt
11. Interlaken

What I listed above is just a basic list, I think there are a lot more to see than this, but I want to make sure that I can see everything in 10 days.  Do you think the list above is a decent itinerary?  How can I improve the list?

* I enjoy hiking and I'm a hobbyist photographer

* I know how expensive Switzerland can be, I've travelled to Tokyo in March, so I can expect how much I will be spending.  I have thought about using Airbnb again for Switzerland, do you think this is a good idea?  Or when I'm traveling to many parts of Switzerland, would it be best to stay in hotels/hostels?

* Is it better to fly into Geneva or Zurich?

* Are restaurants closed on the weekends?  I do read a lot about people buying groceries and preparing the food themselves to save money.

* How long can the train rides be?  Can I select and central point in Switzerland to stay and take day trips from there?  I'm not sure how to plan this at this point.  Instead of sleeping at several locations, I thought about staying at the center of Switzerland and taking the trains to the locations I've listed.  Is this a bad idea?

So I just wanted to say thank you to everyone here.  I am now engaged and Switzerland is absolutely the most gorgeous place on the planet.  

My plan was to drive the Furka Pass and propose at one of the viewing points along the way.  However, the day before, we stopped at Bad Ragaz and it was pouring outside.  I was afraid that it will rain the next day as well and we won't be able to stop.  Then I saw the perfect opportunity.  We decided to go for a walk, the rain died down a bit, and there was not a single soul on the street.  I asked her to marry me in a beautiful little park.

Then the next day, as luck has it, it was absolutely gorgeous and we drove down to Lauterbrunnen through the Furka and Grimsel Passes.  We have never seen anything so beautiful.  The next day, we drove through the Susten pass to Lucerne and eventually made our way back into Germany.  No picture can truly depict the experience.  Also, one of the most memorable aspects of the drive was the air.  It's hard to describe but it was fresh, cool, and felt so clean.  There was nothing like it.

I'll be going to Switzerland for September (4th to 28th) with my wife. It'll be our third visit to the country, and I would greatly appreciate your suggestions for the places to go.

We both love hiking, especially alpine meadows (as opposed to forested areas) and lakes. Cities are also nice, but more like an intermission between hikes. We are in reasonably good shape, although not exactly athletic (I'm 52).

So far we have visited Jungfrau, Vierwaldstättersee and Lago Maggiore regions (we stayed in Brunnen, Interlaken, Vitznau, Brissago and Ascona) and did quite a few hikes around those places, as well as sightseeing in Bern, Lucerne and Ascona/Locarno. We loved it everywhere!

This year, I've already booked the first week of our stay in Zermatt, and we have to be in Zürich on 26th. So now I need to decide how to spend September 11 to 25. The problem is there are too many places to go! I want to visit everywhere. 

But realistically, I need to find two places to stay and explore/hike, one week each.

Usually, we rent a car, but this year we decided to try public transport, and we have bought Swiss Passes for the whole month.

So, please take a moment and tell me your favorite place to be or thing to do!
