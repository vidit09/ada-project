I'm an Australian citizen and I've recently come back from teaching English in a secondary school (12/13 to 15/16 year olds) in Switzerland for a month.

I'm 21 years old and have just completed my third year of study to become a secondary school teacher. I've fallen in love with your country and want to go back to teach for maybe a few years (still not sure how long).

I still have 1 year of study left, but I think I will stretch it to 2 years. I don't know any German but would really love to learn.

Is it possible to do this? How hard would it be to find a job? And how hard is the moving process? What do I need to know about visas etc! Tell me anything you think is relevant. It's a long way away, but I'd just like an idea.

We are aware with most of the challenges such as high cost of living, etc. but I have a couple of questions related to her immigration that I can't seem to find clear answers to online. If anyone is familiar with the process we would appreciate any input.

* From what I've read she would initially be getting a B permit. I have found a ton of info about the B permit online, but most of it seems to be specific to EU citizens who come here by means other than through marriage. How will her specific B permit restrict her ability to work? For example, would she be able to freelance or be self employed? And is full employment a requirement for obtaining the B Permit?

* When can she apply for a Swiss passport? I read two different sets of requirements that are less than clear. One set of instructions says that she can apply for fast track citizenship from abroad after we have been married for 6 years if she can show strong ties to Switzerland (which I think we will be able to do). The second instructions say that we need to have been married at least 3 years and she will have had to live in Switzerland for at least 5 years before she can apply. We have been married 4 1/2 years now and have never lives in Switzerland. Could she still apply for the fast track citizenship after she has lived here on the B permit for a year or would that require us to wait another 4 years to go down the normal track?

Thanks in advance for any advice!

So i go there on the 16.11.13 and they tell me its going to take up to 2 weeks. bummer. but whatever better than a broken phone. 

So now the fun part beginns.

After two weeks i hear nothing from them.

After three weeks i hear nothing from them.

After a fucking month i hear nothing from them.
So i go to the store and ask ""where is my freakin phone?"". Obviously they dont know from anything and the guy simply says that it might take another week.

Fuck

Whatever i decide to wait.

5 Weeks pass and i hear nothing.

So i go there again and ask for my phone once more. The same guy says that he called ""them"" to make pressure and make them hurry to repair my phone and he gives me a nummer i should call. 

I call there (the same place he talked to them about my case as he says). Sure enough they dont know about anything. Device is not in the databank. My name isnt either.
