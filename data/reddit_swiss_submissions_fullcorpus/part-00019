Is this correct? If so, what are these called? Do you need to make reservations? Is there some kind of list of where they are? Are they expensive? Any places on the internet I can go for information on this?

Another question: Is setting up your tent and using that as a shelter for the night dangerous? If so, why?

And lastly, are there any other things we inexperienced (but fearless!) boys need to know?

&gt; Also, I'm hoping to be able to travel around Europe during my year long stay and if you could give me any advice on that it would be fantastic!

&gt; I also had some specific questions:

-I'm not going to be making very much money on my internship so for budgeting I was wondering how much Swiss taxes are. On that same point are there any cost-cutting tips that you recommended for me to save money?

-Is there anything I should bring in particular that I might miss from Canada?

-Do you guys have any suggestions for travel destinations around Europe?

Thanks so much!
