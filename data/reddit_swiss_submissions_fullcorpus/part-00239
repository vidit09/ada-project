I need your help or advice, I'm in my second year of Gymnasium and I have do my maturity project that I'll hand in next year. The theme I took is called *""Lieu Dit""* and I have to tell a place but I can do it the way I want, it's quite an opened theme.

I'm planning on doing it on the **Pâquis** in Geneva since it is quite a unique place in a lot of different ways. I would do some audio interviews and taking pictures to hand a project that stands between geography, art and some kind of social science if I can call it this way.

I had a great entry point since somebody I knew gave me the info of someone who has lived there it's entire life and is quite old now. I was thinking starting there and letting this meeting led up to new persons, contacts and so on. 
But there's my problem, I have talked to this person by phone and it did not really go well. I seemed to be bothering them and they didn't really look like wanting to help me.

I am now quite stuck as I know no one who lives there and I don't know the place very well. I really don't know where to get started now. Does anybody knows somebody I could get in touch with or someplace I could go to meet people? Any suggestions are welcome!

I've been longing to move to Switzerland for quite some time but, obviously, have problems of my own.

1. I don't know any ""official"" language. I do understand some German but I would not say it would be of any real use in the real world. I do speak/write English.
2. I am a developer and I'd say that it's one of the best professions I could have since I only know English, right? Well, for qualified work at least? Dunno, maybe I should just switch to doing something else for a living and just have programming as a hobby.
3. I've been looking for developer positions on Glassdoor, send a couple of CVs and such but no luck so far. How do Swiss people look at outsiders? Especially, people from the ""lower end"" of European Union? What sites should I check out for jobs (would be good if they included filters for English-only speaking people)?
4. Is it possible to support 2 people by having only one person working? Not sure how easily will my significant other will find a job too :(
4. How much money should I have to start with? I heard that the rents are not really the cheapest in Switzerland.

""Dear Mr. Marques,  
  
Thank you very much for your message which Group Human Resources has received on March 11, 2015.  
   
In response to your inquiry, we kindly advise you to ignore the message by www.talentsconnection.ch and review our website for opportunities.  
  
We thank you again for the interest you have shown in our organisation and wish you continued success.  
  
Yours sincerely,""    
  
EDIT2:  
After researching the Richmont website, I did find the same job opening... So I applied directly with them, which of course might render the previous company a bit pissed as they potentially lost some money here. It did show that the Talents Connection is genuine, as the job opening is real.  
Anyway, thank you all for your feedback.

so this morning i got a parking ticket from a private garage. I parked on a parking spot there because there was plenty of free places at 8h13 and left to the gym right across the street, the ticket on my windshield is from 8h15. The dude saw me get out of my car, waited that I leave and then procceed to fine me, with a warning "" if you don't pay in 5 days we will sue you"".  It's not the police, it's the garage, he left me a bill with his banking details so i can wire the 40 franks. Do I have to pay ? Or is it just intimidation ?
