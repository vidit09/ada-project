This is their first visit here.

I've suggested that during their 2-day stay in Lucerne, on the first day, they take the steamer all the way from Lucerne to Fluelen (one of my personal best experiences in all of Switzerland) and then take a train ride back from Fluelen to Lucerne.

I thought they could break their train journey at Brunnen and take the cable car to Urmiberg, spend some time up there, come down and resume the train journey to Lucerne.

Is this worth doing? I've not been up the Urmiberg so proposing this based on what I've seen on the web. Is there something else they could do on the way back from Fluelen?

(On day 2, I suggest they go up Mt Pilatus and see some of the sights of Lucerne town.)
