The only problem I'm having is, the internet, and the warranty paper that came with it both say there's a serial number, and I have no clue where I should be looking for it. 

If it's under the scales then I'm out of luck because I won't dare take the scales off.

It was made in 1991 so it's already 23 years old. I hope to keep it in the same condition for another 20 years. :)
