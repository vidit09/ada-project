Indeed certain elements of these proposed reforms seem eminently reasonable; reforming the way lawyers are paid is long overdue.

However, I would be interested to hear what these non-legal methods of redress for severely disadvantaged individuals and families looking to challenge perceived injustices are, and the efficacy of these methods. 

Presumably, if they are sufficiently efficacious for very poor people then by extension legal recourse should be unnecessary for all people regardless of material circumstance. Let's simply remove the  legal option in such matters. If non-legal methods can be pursued satisfactorily as is claimed then this would save significantly more money...

Yes, National Socialism (Nazi) because it was a nationalist party. National Socialism is the name used for political ideologies which purpose to merge [nationalism and socialism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_socialism)

The policies of the National Fascist Party evolved over time. Initially the party harboured anti-clerical and republican values, but always maintained a [nationalist agenda...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Fascist_Party)

Le Pen you agreed.

Stalinism, is not just referring to Stalin himself, there have been many, and a few still exist, Stalinist dictatorships that use a nationalist ideology. North Korea for example.

Zionism wants more than just the state of Israel to exist. To quote Noam Chomsky (who is Jewish by the way, just in case you didn't know): ""...makes a distinction between the concept of ""a Jewish ethnic homeland in Palestine"" and ""a Jewish state"" in his interview on C-SPAN:""I have always supported a Jewish ethnic homeland in Palestine. That is different from a Jewish state. There's a strong case to be made for an ethnic homeland, but as to whether there should be a Jewish state, or a Muslim state, or a Christian state, or a white state — that's entirely another matter."" Chomsky believes the concept of a Jewish State (or Muslim State or Christian State or white State) directly contradicts the concept of a democratic state as it is understood in the Western tradition, as liberal democracy is founded upon a principle in which there is no privileged citizen.""

&gt; Sounds pretty anti-semitic to me.

How? In what way? As I have explained, Zionism is a political theory. I dislike the Conservative political theories, does this make me racist towards the United Kingdom? William Hague has close ties with factions of the Israeli government. Far from stating any racist intent it just a matter for the record. If I had singled his friends out because they were Jewish, for example if I had said something like. ' his jew buddies', then yes you would have an argument, but I didn't say that at all.

&gt; You can dress it up as much as you like, it is what it is. If you're anti-Zionist, then you are saying that Israel has no right to exist.

Nonsense. Even in Israel many Israeli's oppose the Zionist agenda, as are many other Jewish organizations and people in the world and they certainly don't want to see the destruction of Israel, except maybe one Orthodox Jewish Organization. If you look at the quote from Mr Chomsky, he's not calling for the destruction of Israel either, and neither am I.

&gt; I dislike the Conservative political theories, does this make me racist towards the United Kingdom?

Of course not, but since the proclaimed goal of anti-zionism is the destruction of the Israeli state that doesnt leave much wiggle room for more moderate views. 

This is why I inserted the 'drive the Jews into the sea' quote - that is the stated aim of most anti-zionists in the world today.

A more common example of anti-zionism can be found in [these comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/e6r8i/helen_thomas_speaks_there_is_no_real_freedom_of/), where a redditor called tttt0tttt says: ""She is an honest woman who was targeted in a dishonest way by Zionist scum. What she said was perfectly reasonable and true -- the fuckers stealing Palestinian land should get the hell out of the Middle East and go back to where they came from.""

Now, you may or may not agree with him, but imagine if someone had replaced the word 'zionist' with mexican and the word 'palestinian' with American - well, let's just say he wouldnt have nine upvotes.

Finally, regarding Chomsky's quote on the 'Jewish state'. Israel is not an ethnic Jewish state - muslims and christians all reside within the boundaries. The Druzim have existed in Israel since before the state was founded with no problems, so why couldnt the Palestinians?

Maybe its because they've been used as pawns in a low-intensity conflict since the Arab nations failed to destroy Israel during the Six Day War - a pre-emptive attack on the fledgling nation of Israel that everyone in the West seems to have forgotten.

Muslims are perfectly welcome to live within Israel, but first they have to accept the rules of living in a liberal democracy and share it with other religious groups. It really shouldnt be this hard

My point exactly, there are members of government, and those that pressure the government, a small powerful minority, for expansionist Zionist policies who happen to be friends of Ian Duncan Smith.

&gt; Of course not, but since the proclaimed goal of anti-zionism is the destruction of the Israeli state that doesnt leave much wiggle room for more moderate views.

It would seem the Palestinians (who are not all muslims) don't want to be a part of Israel, and why should they.

I think you will find it was the Israelis who pre-emptively attacked as-Samu in the Jordanian-occupied West Bank. which started the war.

I've met a few Israelis too, one was a complete arsehole the others nice folk. But that's okay we have arseholes in our country too.

Most of us aren't talking about the destruction of Israel just because we are against the rhetoric and actions of a bunch of quite frankly racist criminal murderers.

true,Chavva,null,null,"I think it's difficult to solely blame injuries. Sunderland were, after all, missing their top scorer (and considering only Bent and Gyan had scored for Sunderland prior to Sunday, that is massive). We should instead look at our lack of depth. I understand Abramovich doesn't want to splash stacks of cash anymore, but we're making bad buys when we do. Look at the past 3 windows (S09, W10, S10) of our activity:

S09
+Ross Turnbull - Free - Shit player, still relatively young for a goalkeeper but looks to have almost no potential.

+Daniel Sturridge - 3.5mil+ - Young, but so far has yet to prove himself. 31 appearances, 6 goals. Dreadful return, but has time to improve

+Yuri Zhirkov - 18 mil - Very mixed performances. Has had some great showings but perhaps more often remained largely anonymous. 18 million is a lot for a bench player.

-Andriy Shevchenko - Free - Time to let him go. Bad buy in the first place

-Claudio Pizarro - Undisc. - Again, time to let him go.

W09
No Activity

S10
+Yossi Benayoun - 5.5 mil - Can't say this didn't catch me off guard. I hardly consider him a world class player that should be playing at a club of our stature. He's old, he was only ever going to be a backup, and he's now a long term injury (obviously not forseeable beyond the fact he is old, but doesn't really help the purchase seem like a good one)

+Ramires - 18 mil - Had a decent WC, probably put an extra 5 or 6 million on his price as a result. Again, bought for the bench and definitely overpaid-for. Impressed in Arsenal match but other than that has been largely useless. Young, and has time, but we really needed more proven players.

-Joe Cole - Free - Didn't really have a choice here, he was a greedy cunt. As they say though, form is temporary, class is permanent, and you can't say Joey didn't have the class.

-Michael Ballack - Free - He was old but I think given our other sales over the summer we really should've held on to him. Internally it had to have been known that Joey and Deco weren't going to resign so we really should've given him a new 1 year contract. Brilliant midfield presence to have.

-Deco - Undisc - Couldn't have held him if we tried. He didn't want to be in England anymore, solid player, never quite found the Barca form again, but we couldn't have kept him anyways

-Beletti - Free - Old player, time to let him go. Especially considering we have decent depth at right back

-Ricardo Carvalho - 6.7 mil - Why? Why did we sell Riccy? He may have lost favour to Alex (or so it seemed) but absolutely essential to our depth at centre-back. Especially with Ivanovic having to deputise for Bosingwa. Possibly the worst piece of business in the past 2 years. Granted, we fetched a decent price, but his benefit (esp. now) would've far outweighed that.

If we are to win anything this season, we need proven depth. I'm not saying we need to pull a Madrid and buy 18 first XI players and bench 7, but we need players who can produce results. Even if it means bringing in some older players on 1 year contracts or maybe even loaning a promising youngster that isn't getting time at his club (a la Welbeck). Priority number one has to be a new defender. Then probably a midfielder. Goalkeeper will unfortunately probably have to wait until Summer given Roman's relative unwillingness to hand the manager a blank chequebook these days.

The remarkable and brilliant student action at Millbank has produced some predictable frothing at the mouth from the establishment and right wing press. Cameron has called for the ‘full weight of the law' to fall on those who had caused tens of thousands of pounds of damage to the expensive decor at Tory party HQ. Responsibility is being placed on ‘a violent faction', after the march was ‘infiltrated' by anarchists.
There are an encouraging number of intiatives to show solidarity with the arrested students - something that is vital if they are to avoid the sort of punitive ‘deterrent' sentences handed out to the Gaza demonstrators. A legal support group has been established and the National Campaign against Cuts and Fees has started a support campaign. Goldsmiths lecturers union has publicly commended the students for a ‘magnificent demonstration' .

This is all much needed, as the establishment is clearly on the march with this one. The Torygraph has published an irresponsible and frenzied ‘shop-a-student' piece and the Met are clearly under pressure to produce ‘results' after what they have admitted was a policing ‘embarrassment'.

51 people have been arrested so far, and the police have claimed they took the details of a further 250 people in the kettle using powers under the Police Reform Act. There may be more arrests to come.

Students who are worried should consider taking the following actions:

If you have been arrested, or had your details taken - contact the legal support campaign. As a group you can support each other, and mount a coherent campaign.

If you fear you may be arrested as a result of identification by CCTV, FIT or press photography;

DONT panic. Press photos are not necessarily conclusive evidence, and just because the police have a photo of you doesn't mean they know who you are.
DONT hand yourself in. The police often use the psychological pressure of knowing they have your picture to persuade you to ‘come forward'. Unless you have a very pressing reason to do otherwise, let them come and find you, if they know who you are.

DO get rid of your clothes. There is no chance of suggesting the bloke in the video is not you if the clothes he is wearing have been found in your wardrobe. Get rid of ALL clothes you were wearing at the demo, including YOUR SHOES, your bag, and any distinctive jewellery you were wearing at the time. Yes, this is difficult, especially if it is your only warm coat or decent pair of boots. But it will be harder still if finding these clothes in your flat gets you convicted of violent disorder.

DONT assume that because you can identify yourself in a video, a judge will be able to as well. ‘That isn't me' has got many a person off before now.
DO keep away from other demos for a while. The police will be on the look-out at other demos, especially student ones, for people they have put on their ‘wanted' list. Keep a low profile.

DO think about changing your appearance. Perhaps now is a good time for a make-over. Get a haircut and colour, grow a beard, wear glasses. It isn't a guarantee, but may help throw them off the scent.

DO keep your house clean. Get rid of spray cans, demo related stuff, and dodgy texts / photos on your phone. Don't make life easy for them by having drugs, weapons or anything illegal in the house.

DO get the name and number of a good lawyer you can call if things go badly. The support group has the names of recommended lawyers on their site. Take a bit of time to read up on your rights in custody, especially the benefits of not commenting in interview.

DO be careful who you speak about this to. Admit your involvement in criminal damage / disorder ONLY to people you really trust.

DO try and control the nerves and panic. Waiting for a knock on the door is stressful in the extreme, but you need to find a way to get on with business as normal.

Otherwise you'll be serving the sentence before you are even arrested.

It appalls me that the classrooms of today are in this state, and there are so many contributing factors. One of these is the policy of ""inclusion"", where children with special educational needs or emotional/behavioural difficulties are kept in the same classroom as the children without problems. And in many cases, these kids don't have extra support as schools don't have the budgets to recruit full-time teaching assistants.

At the last school I taught at, there was a boy of 8 years old who'd regularly tear down displays, throw things, swear and—if you were lucky—leg it out of the classroom to go and climb a tree or something. In the mornings, I had a teaching assistant to help keep him in check. In the afternoons, no such luck. So it came down to a choice, usually: waste time reprimanding him futilely, holding up the lesson? Send for support from senior management, leaving you feeling like an impotent incompetent? Or ignoring him and hoping he'd stop, thereby sending the message to the rest of the class that it's all right to act like a psychotic dick?

1. Reddit.com sets up a centralized ""Donate to the Redditch U Sponsorship"" system. This is unlikely, as hueypriest says it could lead legal trouble if something happens. The admins don't like this option.

2. There are companies that deal with this sort of thing often, and will handle all the donation, tracking, and any escrow matters for a fee.

3. Redditch United could set up their own paypal, so we will be giving directly to them, and when we hit an agreed-upon amount, we will earn the shirt-front spot

4. We could set up 501(c)(7) to handle the donations and sponsorship purchasing. This might be the best option, as it would give us a lot of freedom in how we operate:

        A. Redditors could donate to the 501(c)(7), which then gives the money to reddit.com. 
           This eliminates the ""redditors donating directly to reddit"" that the admins disliked.

        B. Redditors donate to the 501(c)(7) which then purchases the sponsorship directly.

           of them having to try to figure out who to contact.

true,hp0,cnty-uk,Oxford,"I am not sure about the OPs view on it. 

But the general idea behind what is refereed to as the robin hood tax. Is to address the bonus culture. (HSBC seems to be doing this anyway so i am not sure what the OP intends.) 

The issue is that the culture of paying huge bonuses and rather rational salaries to people in the banking sector, has a habit of encouraging these people to aim for short term reward to increase this years bonus. 

If instead we can encourage banks to remove/reduce the bonuses and recruit just using salary structures. This will encourage the employees to think more long term. How can I build a company with a stable protfolio that will turn big profits for all the time i am here. 

The thought is that the culture of paying top execs more by money in bonuses (and some of them were huge compared to their salary). rather then giving them a higher wage. encouraged people to think of the banking sector in a jump on the chance get as much money as you can now sort of mentality. 

Most of the robin hood tax ideas I have heard are based on bonus money only. Sure if you earn a couple of hundred k as a contracted salary we tax you at a high rate. But if your bonus is &gt;n% of your salary then the government would like to use extra taxation to try and encourage you to renegotiate your contract in a way that concentrates more on the long term future of banking and your bank specifically.

Dear Matthew Hancock,

I have just been reading a news article regarding Ed Vaizey's report on the future of the UK's internet access from ISPs. (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-17/u-k-government-to-snub-bbc-google-over-web-access-ft-reports.html) 
According to this article the government it states that the government is against net neutrality and is willing to allow preferential services to websites who pay the most at the cost of access to smaller sites.

I am a web programmer living in Haverhill and working in Cambridge, so this issue directly affects me, my work and my lifestyle. In addition, it affects every other UK citizen who has or will have access to the internet. The Internet should be kept as a level playing field, with equal access and opportunities to share knowledge, information and any other form of communication.

If this plan goes ahead it could lead to the following sort of pay structure:
£5 monthly base charge. (with free Microsoft update)

+ £2 for Google.

+ £3 for access to iPlayer

and so on and so forth, until the internet access we would be paying for would be a wholly restricted, controlled and monopolised environment.

I am asking you to represent our region FOR net neutrality, to keep access open for everyone and to anything, not just the highest bidder.

Thank you for your time.

Yours sincerely,

Daniel Samuels.",0,1290026396,null,0,false,0,c15yvrj,t3_e7hv5,t1_c15yvrj,t1_c15xxre,null,1426578870,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"Having gone through the comments here I'm surprised.

I can see how people are obviously opposed in principle, given the call for net neutrality in the US. But there are substantial differences between here and the US.

For one, in most places in the US you have a choice of between 1 and 5 Internet Service Providers. There's no loop unbundling in the US, so the costs for a new ISP to start up in a given area are really really high, whereas in the UK it's not actually that bad. That's why we have hundreds of ISPs in the UK.

Some of these ISPs are absolute utter arseholes of the highest order who will take advantage of this. I look forward to the day where Sky Broadband lets you access the whole of the 'Sky Internet for Free' and 'Addons such as Google and eBay for only £5/mth' because that will fucking murder them.

For every Sky there's a smaller independent who knows that they now have an advantage. Bethere's biggest advantage is speed and cost. Now you have freedom to add to that mix. BT, Sky and Virgin might end up tiering things a certain way off the back of this, but for all the smaller ones (like the modern Demon Internets of the land for those who remember before Demon was bought by Thus) this is potentially a massive win.

Think about it another way - Murdoch's Sky Broadband is probably going to be one of the first because they can include things like the Times paywall as part of their subscription, along with Sky Sports. If they start blocking stuff people want, more will move away from Sky and that can't be a bad thing.

The tories have shot themselves in the foot on this one. Remember when Wikipedia was blocked because of the Scorpions album cover? Now imagine that being the football results. Nobody's going to put up with that, and the circumvention techniques are just as valid, only you'll have the choice to switch ISPs.",0,1290036482,null,0,false,0,c15zm9e,t3_e7hv5,t1_c15zm9e,t3_e7hv5,null,1426579213,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Yes, he was injured when we bought him, and we knew it would take a while for him to be fit for the EPL. However, it was only an investment worth making if we were going to keep him for a while. Unfortunately, Benitez didn't give him enough playing time. There were many occasions where he insisted he was fit, but Benitez refused to play him, citing his injuries as an excuse. 

Then Hodgson came in, made a snap decision, sent him out on loan, and then proceeded to bring in another CM in Meireles.

It doesn't make sense to put the kind of clause in his deal that's there, because it means you either lose a good player for less than you paid, or he goes to Juve, lowers his value and comes back. It's lose-lose for Liverpool.

Agent talk is all bullshit, amplified further when it's re-reported in the papers. As I've already said, most of his statements have been more diplomatic than anything else. If Liverpool don't want him and he's playing somewhere else already, do you expect him to piss off that club too? When he left, he said he'd like to come back. Now when the Italian media ask him how he's liking Juve, of course he's going to give a diplomatic answer.

The Johnson thing sums up why you can't put any stock into this. Yes, he said he'd like Johnson at Juve. You know what came right before then?

So far, the UK banking bailout has cost £1.5 trillion. Or £31,250 for every taxpayer. Clearly a proportion of this is recoverable when shares in semi-nationalised banks are sold. However, this figure of course doesn’t not take into account the cost to individuals, households, businesses, other sectors and the public coffers caused by the recession which followed, and was precipitated by, the financial meltdown.  


These institutions are understandably viewed as being too big to fail. The cost to individual savers or to a government picking up the tab as guarantor would be gargantuan. Thus losses in this sector are to all intents and purposes socialised. 


However the massive profits generated by this sector are avowedly private. While Joe Public is constantly reminded that this is the era of austerity and that we are all in it together through tax rises, public sector lay-offs and reduction in services the banking sector which was recording massive profits prior to the collapse has returned to huge profits and to paying out huge bonuses.

Ed Vaizey is right - for pretty much everyone in the UK,  there is competition.  If you're with a big-box ISP that wants to engage in this, there is no reason why you can't move to a smaller one that doesn't.  Like how traffic shaping is largely the preserve of larger ISPs.

I don't think it is the ""ISP lobby"" that is to blame,  either.  This is just typical Conservativism.  Small state,  less regulation,  don't regulate for things that don't need to be regulated - such as this.  If we were in a situation where everyone had a choice of only a couple of ISPs,  then I can see why we need regulation on this issue.

All Ed Vaizey has said is that the government won't be ""enforcing"" net neutrality, which fits well with the usual conservative policy of non-interference. To him it's like saying ""We won't be forcing Tesco to stop putting Rice Krispies on special offer"". The internet is a medium on which business is done and conservatives believe that businesses will sort it out for themselves. 

What he's failed to understand is that ""net neutrality"" is a horribly impenetrable phrase that actually means ""level playing field"". Our goal is simple to define but extremely difficult to achieve. We have to educate this bunch of public school + business degree luddites in how the internet works. That is, how ISPs connect together, how large internet businesses serve data and how net neutrality will ensure fair competition for innovative start-ups instead of limiting the field to established, wealthy organisations.

I'm not exactly sure how to achieve this. Maybe a pamphlet/booklet that starts something like *""Hello MPs. We're from the internet. We understand that you haven't really had time to get to know our home because you're busy listening to pensioners complain about the colour of leaves this year. Unfortunately for all concerned, it seems like your advisors in this area aren't speaking from a position of great knowledge either. It's a bit like your Mum explaining the offside rule to you - factually questionable and lacking in a deeper understanding of where it came from and why it was put there in the first place.""*

If we can make it well presented, concise and not too heavy I'm sure we can find a way to print a few hundred copies and get it to Parliament. We could post it to each constituency but it would be nice to create a buzz around it, get it to a few media outlets and make MPs actually *want* to read it before we make a big show of delivering it. We would have to try to make Net Neutrality attractive to politicians whatever side they're on - ""competition"" is something the Tories are drawn to, ""fairness"" for the Lib Dems and, erm, whatever Labour believe in this week.

true,bobsleigh,null,null,"* Kuyt is one of the most consistent players for the team, although I agree a decent **young** winger would have been nice. We however did bring in someone who we thought would fill in a huge gap in Joe Cole. Kuyt is a brilliant squad player to have in my opinion, and for everything he lacks in skill he makes up in effort, which is more than be said for a few of the other players in the squad.

* Aurellio is still at the club, and Insua has every chance of coming back as it just a loan deal. Aurellio has recovered from his injury and it is possible that he may play against West Ham on the weekend. He's useful to have on the pitch when it comes down to set pieces, and with Gerrard seeming to be out it wouldn't suprise me if he features as set pieces could be important for us.

The negatives for me are as follows;

* Christian Poulsen- I just can't see him improving the team at all

* Paul Konchesky- Although he had a steady start to his LFC career, there is no evidence from the performances he's put in that he is any better than Insua. Insua at the first half of last season had one of the highest assist records in the league (Maybe the highest if i remember correctly?)

* Defensive Tactics- There is no illusion of suprise that when we attack a team we look a far better team than when were sitting back. We often lack the killer pass to create good counter attacks unless Gerrard or Meireles get on the ball and Torres is looking sharp. Also, I'd love Roy to just try out starting N'gog alongside Torres for a change, he's played some decent football this season and holds the ball well, I think he has the potential to be a leading scorer if he keeps it up.

The positives;

* Our Youth Team- There are alot of players coming through the youth team in recent times that look like they could make it at a high level (Thanks to Rafa that one) and the youth team manager and coaches are doing a great job. The likes of Pacheco, Eccleston, Ince, Suso, Ayala, Kelly, Wilson, Shelvey and even Spearing (You could include N'gog as he's the same age) to some degree look like they all could be placed in the squad at some point.

Britain doesn't have any gas production facilities of any size to speak of anymore. Instead we import from Europe. Guess which currency we pay in? I'll give you a clue, it's not pounds. If you look at how the pound's been faring against the Euro recently I think you'll see there's more than a 7% discrepancy. Of course, that's not strictly relevant because of the way Gas is bought. British Gas commits to certain prices in advance. If the trading price goes above that level BG do alright, if it goes below that level, BG are doing badly. The negotiated price for the next period is probably higher than the last one, that's likely to be a large driver in price.

As for Centrica, Centrica is not British Gas. It owns a whole load of other companies and does things like trading and all sorts of other wacky stuff.

What's Ofcom going to do (if they even have any jurisdiction for this),  assuming that we had a net neutrality law and the US did not? (since many of the their 1 carriers are American) 

Besides,  in the UK we are a lot less reliant on the tier 1s.  ISPs that are worth their salt all have direct peering agreements with the content providers. Perhaps it's a side effect of having only a single Internet exchange that anyone cares about. (there are of course a couple of others,  but LINX seems to be the one that everyone uses) 

In short, I'm not convinced that the UK government would have the power to dictate to the (global)  tier 1 carriers as to what to do. And the carriers aren't going to implement a neutral arrangement in one country and not in another.

In the early 1900s,  telephone provision was largely done by local councils.  A long process of consolidation happened,  in which everyone single municipal telephone company,  apart from Hull's,  was amalgamated.

Hull continued to own their telephone company,  until it was privatised in the 90s.  As a result,  it's the only place where BT does not exist.

Not in my experience, but it's been a few years since I was active in a carrier environment. You're right that LINX are only big player in the exchange point game and the larger ISPs tend to go straight in there and arrange their own peering deals. However, I don't remember many but the very largest content providers having their own deals (and that was in the US anyway) - they tended to connect in via a carrier or other ISP.  We can hope that traffic shaping won't go on at that level but I don't like leaving it to trust (although I realise that is the status quo).

&gt;The club is far from 'crippled' by its current debt with a sum in the region of £20,000 to £30,000 being needed to secure its short term future but it is certainly a concern for all those involved with the club as without this amount being found the club's long term future looks somewhat uncertain.

My name is Steve Workman and I am the Chairman of TRUST (The Redditch United Supporters Trust).
I have recently moved from the town to Virginia Beach VA due to work and I am eager to spread the word and support of our great football club, Redditch United.

You are probably aware of the current financial situation which is effecting most clubs at this level...since the economic down turn in 2008, money is hard to come by with most local businesses withdrawing their support to ensure their own survival.

Now I am this side of the pond, it would be good to represent the club and work with you guys to gather support and financial backing to not only sponsor but maybe buy shares in the club?

Do you fancy owning a part of the Reds and be involved with the running and decision making of a UK soccer club?

We can do this with an investment of 10,000 dollars buying a 20% shareholding...interested?
If we can raise these funds, each contributor will become a shareholder under the TRUST umbrella...having a voting right at Board level and contribute to the future success of Redditch United.

You know, there is a great team at the club...the coach, Matt Gardiner, is a bright young manager who will definately move on in the professional game (his brother is a top coach with Tottenham Hotspurs)..the Reds weekly playing budget is only 1300 dollars compared to some teams in the league paying 20,000 dollars!! It is amazing we are even competing!! It is like a college football team competing in the NFL!

Guys, let's get to know one another...I can not speak highly enough of Andy (redditchbluenose), Joe (rawlings) and Sam (intothevalley) etc...they are die hard fans of their local soccer team and deserve all the success they get.

If anyone is interested, I will start the fund off with 1000 dollars.

Speak soon.

&gt;
&gt; First-past-the-post now has an 11-point lead over the Alternative Vote. 
&gt;
&gt; There's more bad news for the Liberal Democrats in the latest YouGov poll. The party is back down to just 11 per cent and support for electoral reform has fallen to its lowest level yet.
&gt;
&gt; The latest figures show that just 32 per cent are in favour of adopting the Alternative Vote, with 43 per cent opposed to reform. By comparison, back in June, AV had a lead of 10 points over first-past-the-post. The graph below shows how sharp the decline in support has been.
&gt;
&gt;The campaign proper may not begin until next year, but it looks as if the Yes campaign will have a lot of ground to make up.
&gt;
&gt; The No campaign is also significantly better organised and better funded. It already has an experienced team in place, including Matthew Elliott, the former chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, the Australian pollster Lynton Crosby (who masterminded Boris Johnson's election), the Tory MPs Bernard Jenkin and George Eustice, as well as James Frayne, former campaign director of the Taxpayers' Alliance, who led the successful referendum campaign against a north-east regional assembly.
&gt;
&gt; The No camp can also count on backing from wealthy City donors fearful that AV would lead to a succession of hung parliaments. The Yes camp has neither the organisational nor the financial muscle to compete.
&gt;
&gt; Meanwhile, the coalition's decision to bundle its partisan boundary changes with the AV referendum means that few Labour activists are prepared to lend the campaign their support.

AV wouldn't have changed much - the last few elections would have had the same result

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8506306.stm

&gt; MPs are to vote on whether to hold a referendum on scrapping Britain's first past the vote electoral system in favour of the Alternative Vote (AV). If AV had been used in previous general elections would it have changed the result?
&gt;
&gt; This graphic illustrates how the results of the last six general elections might have looked had the 'alternative vote' system been in place. The overall outcome of the contests would not have changed, but the Liberal Democrats would have gained the most seats and the scale of the Conservative defeat in 1997 would have been much greater, the research suggests.

During the election Nick Clegg said AV was a ""miserable little compromise""

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/i-want-to-push-this-all-the-way-declares-clegg-1950668.html

&gt; Raising his party's sights, he declared: ""Everyone says the only question is whether we could support another party. But I think it is now much more open than this. We are going for broke. I want to try to push this all the way.""
&gt; 
&gt; Until now, the Liberal Democrats have suggested they would accept the alternative vote (AV), with people listing candidates in order of preference, on which Labour has promised a referendum next year. But Mr Clegg is now demanding the ""alternative vote plus"" system, which unlike AV is proportional and was recommended by Lord Jenkins of Hillhead in 1998.
&gt;
&gt; Mr Clegg said: ""AV is a baby step in the right direction – only because nothing can be worse than the status quo. If we want to change British politics once and for all, we have got to have a quite simple system in which everyone's votes count. We think AV-plus is a feasible way to proceed. At least it is proportional – and it retains a constituency link.
&gt;
&gt; ""The Labour Party assumes that changes to the electoral system are like crumbs for the Liberal Democrats from the Labour table. I am not going to settle for a miserable little compromise thrashed out by the Labour Party.""
&gt;
&gt; Mr Clegg suggested he would not force Mr Brown to stand down as the price of a deal with Labour. ""If we can deliver a once-in-a generation opportunity to change politics from top to toe, I am not going to start being precious about my personal likes and dislikes.""",0,1290166833,null,0,true,0,c1664nk,t3_e5n37,t1_c1664nk,t1_c15izgi,null,1426582288,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"I saw this yesterday and genuinely wondered if he was right. To be honest the only problem right now is that the banks have shot themselves in the foot by lending anything to anyone and everyone since the 80s. This model of living on borrowed money is completely unsustainable but it was the norm for several decades. We hit the wall at speed. 

With lending down new businesses suffered without venture capital. This screwed everyone from the tradesmen that build the premises to the staff that would have worked in them. That sucks but did eventually correct itself as the bankers slowly began to lend to the more reliable borrowers. If the end result is a situation where people with no income cannot get credit cards then things will be better in many ways!

Look at it from the Tory opportunist view. This ""downturn"" is their 9/11. It's allowing them to push through ideological policy as a ""response"" to an external condition. The Tories do not want ""thinkers"" at universities, they want people there purely to learn a profitable trade so that they may take the lions share of the take.

However the sentiment expressed (through-out this informal interview) reveals some peculiar perspectives:

Mortgage payments are low therefore the British people have never had it so good. This thinking equates home owners with the British people. Those without a mortgage are apparently not considered. This may seem to over state the case a touch but [property linked franchisement has a long heritage](http://hubpages.com/hub/Requiring-property-ownership-to-vote) particularly in Conservative thought. 

His qualification of the recent economic turmoil as the “so-called recession” is not only manifestly untrue based on the technical definition of [recession]( http://tutor2u.net/economics/content/topics/macroeconomy/recession.htm) but also reveals a lack of understanding and empathy for those who suffered and are suffering real hardship as a result.

It is the lack of understanding and empathy, from those who’s privileged upbringing and comfortable lifestyle, for those without comparable economic means (the vast majority of British population) which is alarming. 

The Conservative party may have become much better at public relations but now and again the mask slips.

true,Marogian,eng-essex,Essex boy in London,"...Uh? Go ask the director/principal of a small business which actually does something useful how stuff is going. Hint: They won't say we've never had it so good.

And no, this isn't primarily because people aren't spending money they don't have- although this is important in certain industries- its because small business often accept large contracts after taking bank loans to fund the initial investment in material and labour.

Some large company offers you a £10million contract to build a fleet of specialised vans, you're not going to be sitting on the £2million capital required to buy the parts, vans and then the £1million it'll cost to employ the staff for the six months it'll take to pay for them. You get a bank loan, accept the contract, get the payment and then pay off the loan.

These days its very very difficult to get a loan on the basis of a contract. This affects not only the company making the specialised vans, but the company that wants the specialised vans- it either has to pay a lot more for the contract as much fewer companies can afford to take it, or it has to pay up-front, which costs more and entails a lot more risk- what happens if the specialist company goes bust in the next six months? This also affects the commercial sales arms of car dealerships which sell the vans- no more specialist sales.

I'm not talking out of my ass by the way, its happening.

He's talking about the people who have survived the recession and are still in good stead. Single men and women and married couples who both are lucky to still have their £25k+ pa job. That is who he is talking about. But for a large portion of the population who don't have those kinds of jobs things are very very difficult. A lot of people are struggling and will find it even more difficult in the years to come. People who have been made redundant. People who have disabilities or have to give up their job to care for someone who has a disability. People who are still struggling to find work. Take a look around. They are all over the place. So people are complaining about the cuts and they have every right to do it. And they have every right to be enraged by comments like this.

It's funny how every time the economy goes balls up and people face hard times the Tories come along and make it worse. Yes cuts need to be made but it seems to me these are cuts designed to make poor people poorer and worse off whilst rich people stay rich.

It boggles the mind how out of touch the Cameron and his goons are. It comes as no surprise that Cameron, Osborne and Duncan-Smith and most everyone else in that government have no idea what it's like to live on benefits, or to have crazy student debts or to live in constant fear of redundancy or any other of a long list of problems that many, many people are having right now.

The situation is exactly as you call it.

Graduates, for the most part, do not pump more money into the economy unless their contribution to their employers, or their own business or whatever increases the GDP of the country, as a consequence of more export, higher-value export, less import (or more specifically, less requirement for import) and lower-valued import. On a whole, the chances of being beneficial to the economy having a degree are only slightly higher than that of somebody without a degree.

This country does not need more degrees, it needs more innovation and consequently more export. This country needs to support true innovation, as an innovation is far more likely to stay in the country longer than a person sitting with a degree; innovations live far longer lives than humans too.

So yes, anyway, you can stop having a strong opinion on a subject you don't understand now. Stop kidding yourself that University is definitely the place that you must go and you must irrefutably fight for ""your right"" to it (because I'm betting you don't have anything better planned). If that's how short-sighted you are, you'll get nowhere of any significance in this world. But yeah, you might earn a fairly reasonable amount of money, but the way degrees are going, that would depend extremely heavily on your degree and on a fair amount of luck too.

Edit: Just looked up your reddit profile to make sure I wasn't coming down too harsh on you (in case you were doing a proper degree in something like Mathematics and were just misinformed in general about the recession and the economic impact (or lack of) of University tuition fee increases), but it really does look like I'm right.

also graduates with useful technical degrees in the sciences ect can add to the general financial heath of the country as they end up in higher earning threshold and a % do end up in R&amp;D roles. overall all graduates properly don't add greatly to the tax income as a great deal that have degrees in drama and other bull earn jack shit in mac D's",0,1290298788,null,0,false,0,c16bzll,t3_e97mv,t1_c16bzll,t1_c16bw4l,null,1426585051,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,weblypistol,cnty-uk,Llanfairpwllgwyngyll.... etc.,"Whilst I appreciate your perspective, I am dubious as to the situation still. A comment in [another article](http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/streathamnews/8670892.Disabled_girl__health_and_safety_risk___says_school/) by another former pupil also states the corridors are smallish but capable of comfortably accommodating two way flow with a wheelchair. Further they seem to have initiated a traffic flow system of sorts.  The school rules demand good behaviour in the corridors, plus in the event of a fire pupils are trained on orderly dispersal with fire drills. It seems more a question of pupil behaviour management. 

It seems there is disabled access ( though not a disabled toiled), and public places have for some time had a duty to provide reasonable measures. The school has a policy on disabled pupils, so the whole question of a wheelchair being the problem would appear bogus. Why have a policy and such access ramps at all?  I wonder if a disabled parent would be denied a visit, or a pupil who had had an operation and temporarily/permanently wheel chair bound not be allowed access. 

So that brings in the question of her academic ability. The school should not be allowed to have selective practices. If this happens, we are effectively back to grammar schools. If 90% of selection is random, why is this an issue? As to her abilities, there is not enough here to go on to explain that or if it is accurate. Even then the school should be a place where a child is developed and nurtured to achieve, not cherry-pick for good results.

The letter seems more than a faux-pas. Not only was it a foolish move, he could have just said she was unlucky due to over-subscription. It could be the making of legal action for all I know. I wonder how many disabled pupils are at the school?

In an ideal world there would be no debate because people would be able to trust each other not to indoctrinate each others children. So there would be agnostic schools.

Instead atheists think religious people want to make their kids believe in sky fairies and religious people think atheists want to make their kids renounce god as a delusion.

Sadly (though not without good reason) neither side trusts the other. So everyone wants what they think is right for their kids.

The result is that atheists try to force all schools to be a-religious and teach nothing about faith. Meanwhile the faithful bunker down and want more and more right to teach (and not teach) what they like and to be picky about who gets in.

Neither is really working towards fairness, balance, or separation of church and state. Both are demanding their view of what's right be forced on others.

People say ""why should my tax money go to teach religion?"" but they never stop to ask ""Is it fair that Christians and others tax money should go to teach evolution?"" 

Really the best solution (IMHO) is for everyone to pay to teach both. Then kids themselves can decide.

""Because, my dear, do you not think that the country as it is today is a very different place than it was in the 1930s? Consider the wide range of backgrounds and ethnicities that make up modern Britain. Nobody's saying the past was a land of racial harmony and perfection, but if you open the door to faith-based education in the modern era than you will see much more diversity of opinion and even fact"".

She was not swayed.

""I would rather my grandchildren were educated at a good Church of England school than sent to some roger-me-blaggard state school to get stabbed, raped, or sworn at. Not necessarily in that order, mind!"" She said, wiping jam off her knife and onto her toast. ""Although, honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about""

I felt I should point out that the faith based schools initiative was the brainchild of our disgraced former politburo Mr Blair, an individual one could describe a ""born again Catholic"". Of course he was going to put emphasis on faith-based education.

And so it was this morning. It should come as no surprise that dear Pam was not happy with this latest news this morning as she joined me for our traditional breakfast.

""Have you seen this!"" She spluttered loudly, almost causing me to drop my teapot and rattle my toast rack. Waving her crispy copy of the Daily Mail she started ranting about the bloody Muslims and how she knew they'd be teaching their children evil deeds from an early age at the first chance they were given. And, oh my, she was right dammit! What else should I have expected? Why, these schools should be shut down immediately!

""My dear, do you not see the hypocrisy in what you're saying?"" I replied, picking up my teaspoon and taking aim to deliver a good solid thwack to the side of a soft-boiled egg. ""Have you thought that this story to which you have dragged my attention this cold and dark Monday morning is nothing but the other side of the same coin that lets you send your grand children to your C of E school?"" Time for my perfect toastie soldiers to go for a dip in an egg. ""For you see, by saying that you are happy with *your* religion being the basis of education, you are implying that this religion is also suitable to teach to children. Or are you saying that there should be two rules? One for the Muslims, another for the Church?""

She was slightly taken aback. At this point the milkman made his delivery so Pam became distracted, suddenly eager to say hello to Abed (or Ahmed, possibly Ach'ed, we're never really sure). I like to think I'd made a point but one is never really sure whether one has made a difference to dear Pam's worldview.

While it's not uncommon for us to end one of our ""talks"" with me trying desperately not to call her a racist and for her to enthusiastically deny being a racist without ever being accused as such, I hope today she was persuaded that giving schools over to the types of religious people who would want to run a school could have unforeseen consequences beyond that old adage of ""It never did me any harm"".",0,1290422175,null,0,false,0,c16h10d,t3_e9uft,t1_c16h10d,t3_e9uft,null,1426587437,51,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,51

Haven't watched the video yet, but that sounds like the sort of comparison someone would make who wanted to make a big number sound emotive and scary, rather than put it into proper context.  

[Any macroeconomic number is going to sound scary when put like that](http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/26930.html) -- if only because the human mind finds it hard to comprehend very big numbers.  And it's unhelpful.  If you'd instead been told that ""the national debt when shown as 10 pound notes stacked up on top of each other would reach up 6,561 miles into Space"", that would have sounded just as incomprehensibly scary as what you were actually told -- when actually, if put in context, it would be very low.

One [not the only] human-understandable figure is the debt as a proportion of GDP, which is currently about 68% (currently rising) for the UK.  To put it in context, this is significantly higher than e.g. the US (52%), Norway (60%), or Switzerland (40%), but significantly lower than e.g. Italy (115%), France (77%), or Belgium (97%).  Towards the top end of the scale are Japan at 189%, Lebanon at 156%, and Zimbabwe at 282%.  (Greece is 127%).  At the bottom end, Mozambique, Oman, and Libya are all around 4%; Russia is around 6%.

More importantly, the Muslim birth rate in Europe is currently more than three times that of non-Muslims, contributing to the burgeoning numbers of Muslims in Europe.** As a result, Muslim communities in Europe are significantly younger than the non-Muslim population, and Europe’s “Generation X” and “Millennium Generation” include considerably more Muslims than does the continent’s population as a whole.

...

&gt;**By 2015, Europe’s Muslim population is expected to double, whereas Europe’s non-Muslim population is projected to fall by at least 3.5 per- cent.Looking further ahead, conservative projections estimate that, compared to today’s 5 percent, Muslims will comprise at least 20 percent of Europe’s population by 2050**. Some even predict that one-fourth of France’s population could be Muslim by 2025 and that, if trends continue, Muslims could outnumber non-Muslims in France and perhaps in all of western Europe by mid-century.	Although these projections seem incredible at first glance, they may not be far off the mark. At present, more than 15 percent of the 16–25-year-old cohort in France is Muslim; in Brussels, 25 percent of the population under the age of 25 is Muslim. A factor in this equation that is as important as the dramatic increase in the Muslim population is the dramatic decline of the general European population, which, according to UN projections, will drop by more than 100 million from 728 million in 2000 to approximately 600 million, and possibly as low as 565 million, by 2050.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"A friend of mine has a top-level position working for one of the big tobacco companies (he is the director of European marketing or something impressive like that).  I haven't seen him for a few years as he lives in Switzerland.  But I can remember him telling me about this 2 or 3 years ago now when we were last out snowboarding together.  Even back then the tobacco companies already knew it was coming and were starting to prepare for it.

The real impact of plain packaging is that is removes branding.  And when there is nothing to differentiate a packet of Marlboro, say, from any other packet of cigarette, then there is far less incentive for tobacco companies to spend money marketing their brand.  So the real goal here is to further restrict tobacco marketing/advertising so that fewer people will start smoking - impressionable youngsters in particular.

If memory serves, my friend told me that the tobacco companies are really rather worried about this as the market research they've done suggests it will have a big impact on the number of new smokers.  But they had some clever ways in which they were planning to work around it (my friend told me some of the ideas they had, but I honestly can't remember - sneaky stuff, though).

So as much as I detest the government interfering, there is some fairly strong evidence to suggest that it could have a long term reduction in the number of smokers.  Speaking as a smoker who hopes his kids never start, I think this is probably a Good Thing.  As long as I can still buy it, then I don't care what kind of packet it comes in. 

The people who will really lose out in the short term are the sports, music events and so on that still accept tobacco sponsorship.  If cigarettes must be sold unbranded then that money will start drying up.

The privatisation of education creates a fairly major shift in how the institution and students interact; this is as much a problem for me as the fact fees are increasing. Education should not be a business as the primary outcome for a business is profit not customer outcomes.

That is largley an argument of history and we will see its effects for good or ill over the coming decades since education has been privatised and there are nowhere near enough funds to bring it under public ownership again. 

What we need as a society is is largley irrelevant since the Tories are concerned primarily with reducing government spending and improving our economy as much as possible.

Currently, the Football Club has only 2 Directors at the moment.

The complete debt of the Club, is just short of £50,000

Oustanding debt is with HMRC which is £4,000
And another Debt with EON is £10,000.

The playing budget is £1,000, which is by far the lowest in the league.

The council want £950 a month to bring things back level, this is an impossible figure for Redditch United to meet at a monthly basis, we are Currently paying out £200 a month just to keep them happy.

Thanks to the Bigger gates in the opening games of the season, AFC Telford and Boston United, the gate reciepts are £11,000, but as you can see from the mounting debts, this is nowhere near enough.

We are making progress with our Creditors.

Ken Rae is very positive about the contribrution of Reddit, he said it is fantastic to have support from other sources, and he welcomes any input from Reddit.

In terms of money making opportunities ideas raised were poor. The best thing to come out of this meeting was Reddit, and everybody was interested!

Keep up the work lads!

UTR!

Edit :
Debts are as follows:
£10,800.00 to EON (Electricity supply)
£4100.00 to HMRC (Her Majesty Revenue Customs)
£4000.00 to Flights Coaches
£1800.00 to Severn Trent (Water supply)
