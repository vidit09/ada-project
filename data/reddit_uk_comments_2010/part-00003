This is the real gem, we shouldn't be paying for it but we are, there is nothing we can do to change this fact now. We can lie about the numbers until hell freezes over but we **are** going to have to pay for it. Now either you can have labour raise national insurance (the nhs have the biggest ni bill in the country so any raise in ni means a hit on the nhs); you can have the tories cut spending on education and welfare, but we all know that poor people are breading like amoeba and he doesn't care because the rich wont be effected; or we can have the lib dems raise more taxes on the middle class. To top it off there is likely to be a fair amount of inflation both from fuel and devaluation of the pound whichever party we vote in, making everything they promise a lie and worse in reality.

Personally I like getting taxed more if it is honest and that money is going towards education and not towards religious wars. In fact I don't even mind labour that much. I'm pissed about Blair starting a war and brown for being clueless, but the party is bigger than those two and they have done a lot of good things over the past 12 years.

This country kinda pisses me off sometimes, we want the best but refuse to pay for it, then bitch at the second rate service we get.

I know the pension scheme is in the hole, but are we going to blame the RM workers (who will lose their jobs potentially) or the shitty management that the shitty government put in charge?

That is simply not true. I'm 19, I get mail all the time. Not to mention small businesses rely on it. The RM affects a lot of people, it is a key public service. I understand it might not directly affect you, but that on its own is not a reason it should be privatised: there is a lot to be said for solidarity with those like you

The government actually weights road development higher than rail development. I can't remember the exact details but they basically calculate that 1 more mile of road contributes to the economy more (i.e. makes someone rich richer) than 1 more mile of rail. It's their policy to develop fast travel for people in cars rather than green public transport. Selling things off won't help that.

&gt;This is the real gem, we shouldn't be paying for it but we are, there is nothing we can do to change this fact now. 

We can, we're in an election year for a start not to mention the polling booth is only democracys bluntest instrument. Nationalise the banks, the major industries, bring it all in to public ownership and the obscene profits currently generated can both eat in to the public debt and keep our motorways, our railways and the RM public. We're being bombarded from all sides saying 'there must be cuts!'. But there really doesn't have to be. It's a shame this rhetoric has been so persuasive and no everyone has given up and resigned themselves to the public services being sold off or rolled back.

Now, I don't want to pay for all these middle ages people retiring at 60 when they should probably be retiring at 65-70 because the government doesn't have any balls to deal with the issue. 

One of the mechanisms to deal with the problem, by letting inflation eat into those high value pensions, is completely fucked because of shitty house mortgages. If inflation gets high we have to kick everyone out on to the street. So we are going to have really shitty growth for the next 10 years as we pay for all these debts. Now I do think think nationalises works as well as you think, we are part of a global economy and we rely on a fairly large income from financial services. If we nationalised those industries they would leave. We already have some ridiculously lax regulation to keep them happy because the government is scared shitless that they will leave. 

See, most pension plans that **almost all** of the people of the UK pay in to (and I think the government is going to shortly mandate we have to pay into) don't put that money into banks, they invest in the stock market. So even though if seems evil to sell off these industries to the evil private sector, if it makes them more profitable it benefits everyone with a pension because they are some of the largest owners of stocks and so receive the benefits. If you like, the problems are that job security goes down and the pensions aren't as good, because we have lots of safety nets these people all get the help they need via the government anyway, they don't need job security because they have life security. And don't get me started on pensions, they are fucked, what the fucked are they going to do with final salary pensions when people start living longer?

The unsocialised underclass is a minority that have been left behind in the general march forward - they are say 5 people for every 100.

Now lets turn back the clocks of time, suppose we are in a factory of 100 workers, in the 80's. There are two scenarios:

1) Factory closes down, 95 workers relocate and successfully find jobs over time. The 95 workers now, on average will have higher paying jobs, pay more tax, and their kids &amp; family are likely to have a better lifestyle as more money is spent on public services. However, the 5 workers that cannot get works become disenfranchised and breed an unsocialised underclass. 

2) Factory is prevented from closing down due to subsidy, all workers get to keep their jobs. Their pay remains constant and therefore their quality of lifestyle remains constant. Their kids &amp; family do not enjoy a better lifestyle as public services have even less money, as taxes are being spent on subsidising factories.


As you can see scenario 1 is clearly better for a majority of people. Imagine if the factory workers got better paying jobs in a call centre - those people would now be getting fired today and they would have to find new higher paying jobs. 

You see it's a perpetual cycle were people lose jobs and get new better jobs. However, some people in the cycle get left behind and it becomes increasingly hard to get back on as the new better jobs require increasing amounts of skill, which if your part of the unsocialised underclass you simply do not have.

People in China will find the same thing as their factories close down in the next 30 - 40 years and they move to service sector economy. ",0,1266441322,null,0,false,0,c0kqj0k,t3_b2og2,t1_c0kqj0k,t1_c0kq0bm,null,1426217635,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Every single episode wasn't focused on how humanity is the end all and be all of the universe's existence.  The doctor almost had an air of superiority about him, as a timelord probably would. Sometimes he had the answers, and sometimes he didn't.  Aside from the first two (and tom baker, naturally), Eccleston's way up there in my book.  He had a weird sort of dorky style that really fits the part.  Like Sherlock Holmes meets Napolean Dynamite or something.  Maybe that's a bit extreme, but it's along those lines.

But it would be great to see an update. The End of Time has given us a good 'back door' to introduce some other Time Lords if they really wanted. Maybe in a [self-fulfilling prophecy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3UK02HF-cg), he can be played by Ricky Gervais!

Out of all the companions that could return and be interesting for new viewers, Susan seems to be the obvious choice. What a can of worms that would open. Personally, I loved Jo Grant, Tegan (I know she's not popular with everyone!), Ace and Romana. They would probably be tricky to introduce to new viewers. Sarah Jane was a great choice because she was always a journalist. She could easily return and still be one. Not sure what Ace or Tegan would be up to now, and Romana...well, see comments on the Monk. Jo could quite plausibly be working for a climate change organisation by now.

The Autons made a good choice for a reboot due to the fact they look like something in the real world. New viewers would be as freaked out as Rose when the mannequins first came to life and they had no idea this was a classic alien's MO. They certainly scared the crap out of me as a child.

You can appreciate the introduction of new Cybermen for a new audience. It's easier to start from scratch than to explain Mondas and a very convoluted history. The head in the museum tells us they are still canonical. if they can figure out a way to differentiate them from the Cybus Cybermen, I say bring them back. But we may not 'need' them now RTD has used the new ones a few times.

I'd love to see the Zygons back, purely because they were one of the most wonderfully realised aliens in the old series EVER. An updated Krynoid story would also be epic.

I love the idea of bring back Omega, or basically any malevolent Time Lord (God Damn...HOW good was Dalton as Rassilon!!?!?).

I absolute understand the re-into of the Cybermen, I'm just saying I wouldn't mind if the Doctor came across a ship that contained some of the old Cybermen. Slightly updated, but not as ""Iron Man"" as the new ones.

So you get an upvote from me.

I disagree with you because, despite your astute observation on the passive/agressive issue, it is a terrible shame to see the terrorists winning the so-called ""war"" via the idiotic erosion our freedoms and privacy by the excessive application of laws and regulations which were supposedly made to protect us from ""terror"", but actually end up as instruments of oppression and state-control.

""I may not agree with what you say, but I'll upvote to the limit for your right to say it.""

Upvotes all round from me.  I'd much rather be reading the intelligent discussion resulting from a difference of opinion / perspective than watching a pep rally.


I think we all agree that erosion of our privacy is a bad thing and it *is* something that we should peacefully resist, lest we find ourselves sleepwalking into a surveillance nation (assuming we haven't already).

But I'm going to play devil's advocate and expand more at what I think is the interesting point that Kyusu is making.

If I was taking pictures in public and a police officer approached me, I can't think of any reason why I wouldn't want to volunteer my name, explain that I'm taking pictures of XXX for reason YYY and be as helpful as possible as long as it didn't overly inconvenience me.  Simply because that's the *same courtesy I would extend to any other member of the public*.

It could just be a passer-by with a similar interest in photography.  Perhaps they want to get all geeky and talk about lenses.  Sorry I don't have time right now, but hey, here's my email address - let's chat online.

It could be an over-protective parent concerned that I'm a potential pedophile.  Yes, it's ridiculous and a sad reflection on our society.  But I understand why parents get like that (I'm one myself).  Sure, I would be slightly offended at the implication, but would want to reassure them that I'm a Good Guy as best I could.  My name is XXX.  I'm YYY's dad - see that's him there.  Ah, your girl ZZZ must be in the class above him at school... etc..

It could be an over-zealous police officer with terrorist performance targets to meet.  He knows I'm not a terrorist and I know that he knows I'm not a terrorist.  But sadly, he doesn't know that yet.  He's got a smart uniform, a flashy badge, and he has a job to do.  I'm happy to give him a pat on the head, make him feel important for a moment or two and then send him on his way.  How do I do that?  By being as open, friendly and co-operative as possible.  A little deference to his/her authoritay goes a long way.

Sure, I'm not obliged to do it, any more than I'm obliged to talk politely and not say ""fuck flaps"" in front of my grandma (who is now sadly dead so I guess it's safe).  But I *choose* to do it because it helps to project a positive image of myself to the people around me.  

If you respond to an inquiry by saying something like ""Hello, yes, I understand your concerns, but you have nothing to worry about, I'm taking pictures of XXX for YYY, here's my card, please feel free to contact me if you have any further question"" then I like to think that it should be enough to end the matter there and then in 99% of the cases.

Of course you don't *have* to do this and no-one has the right to *require* you to proffer this kind of information.  But these are the kinds of things that we do, day in, day out, so that we can all get along in society.

I wonder if any act of terrorism has ever been averted by means of a Police Officer spotting somebody taking photos in a public street?

No I don't actually. I'm damn sure it has never happened. These laws are made in their thousands with the express intention of protecting us from the very low risk of terrorist attack, but what they mainly achieve is opression against the people they are supposed to protect. The only time a citizen is likely to encounter one of these laws is when they are challenged by Police for ""breaking"" them, so it is the only opportunity a citizen is likely to get to offer practical resistance. Hence *some* citizens will object as we saw here.

Your suggested response is perfectly reaonable, and one that I'm sure the majority would use in such a situation, but as much as the photographer in the video was being a bit of an arse, he also had a very good point and chose to stand up against petty opression carried out by officials who sometimes lose sight of the real target, and instead of hunting down violent murderers, end up persecuting harmless idiots.",0,1266923360,null,0,false,0,c0l1kjv,t3_b51o1,t1_c0l1kjv,t1_c0l1k9d,null,1426222830,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I would be interested in seeing what qualifies as a ""terrorist offence"", but I wouldn't be surprised to find that it encompasses a wide range of pseudo-terror misdemeanors, e.g. incitement to commit terrorist acts, planning to commit terrorists acts, having a book that mentions terrorist acts, looking at me in a funny way, etc.

Strange, they didn't find any of my English jokes funny and in fact usually took great umbrage.

The ""hatred"" you speak of is rare. There is however great resentment, a lot of it created by the London based media. Imagine if the UK got alls its news etc through Berlin or Paris and the UK was just an aside (with Berlin's or Paris' slant). Try listening to the news - living in Scotland this should be even more apparent to you - and see how many stories are actually England only (or England &amp; Wales only) but reported as UK stories, or how many stories would have a relevant Scottish element - if the program makers had been bothered. I'm not sure if the people who run BBC Radio 4 &amp; 5 actually realise we receive these stations in Scotland. Listen to the sports reports on the radio - Scotland's coverage usually consists of less than 20 words and will usually only cover Rangers and Celtic.

You would not expect Dutch fans to cheer Germany or Portuguese fans to support Spain. Why - just because we share an island- are Scots expected to support England? Scotland is a separate nation which predates the formation of England (843 AD v 927 AD). The process which brought our two nations together would not be acceptable today. Many in Scotland would have it otherwise.

When the *World Cup* starts we will no doubt be subjected to wall to wall coverage of a team that does not interest us in the slightest - this is just a coping mechanism.

Nothing of the sort.

It is not about Scottish news being dominant or even equal prominence. It is about not having your news and media delivered by a “foreign” country. You may have missed that N Ireland, Wales and Scotland have all been the beneficiaries  of devolution. This now means, for Scotland, that the bulk of responsibility for law and order, transport, health and education now resides in Holyrood rather than Westminster (ie the bulk of what govt does, excepting the economy, defence and foreign policy). Accurate reporting is important, especially in an election year. Confusing English only matters with UK matters cannot be seen as good reporting at any time and gives a distorted, false message to the electorate in Scotland, Wales and N Ireland.

You may also not be aware of the growing calls for a “Scottish 6” to address this problem and remove this source of grievance. That is dispensing with BBC London's six o'clock news and a having our own Scottish produced news program. This has been dismissed by BBC London. Just like the Scottish opt out for the last 15 minutes of Newsnight was originally dismissed (and actively sabotaged by BBC London during its first months).

true,wozzy25,null,null,"Desecration of a corpse is a long standing legal no-no anyway so filming it and distributing is by association a secondary illgeal act. Interference does not necessarily mean that you'd have to inject embalming fluid into the genitals or in other words to impede decay. To interfere is defined molesting or assaulting sexually by the OED. So if you molest or sexual assault a corpse you can be said to have interefered with it. I'll admit the idea of desecration could be regarded by some as outdated given the secular age we live in but it stands. You may be interested in what John Spencer has to say. (Criminal liability for the desecration of a corpse [2004] 6 Archbold News 7-9.)

The law does not convey on animals the ability to consent or commit crimes. They are innocent agents who are unaware fully of what they are doing. There are many laws out there designed to prevent cruetly to animals because they have no defence as such. This law could be considered therefore to be linked to the anti animal cruelty legislation. If we assume that animals have no feelings, why should we protect them from cruelty or harm? If you think we should protect them from unnecessary harm, then by proxy sexual acts with them should be banned. 

As for violence, the reason behind this is essentially to protect vulnerable people from physical harm, which is acutally the purpose of a lot of the law would you believe. Even if it is staged and the participants are willing, the person watching it for sexual gratification may think that it is real. The law precludes people from agreeing or consenting to anything above Actual Bodily Harm (ABH) following R v Brown. So filming anything which is so violent that it cause ABH is also an illegal act. You can imagine people who are in a vulnerable position or maybe not fully mentally capable being taken advantage of by people making these films.

The reason behind the legislation is incapsulated in the brief discussion in the statute of the watcher believing it is real. If you believe it is real and you get off on it, you'll go looking for more and possibly more extreme stuff such as snuff films, genuine animal cruelty or inter alia watching someone desecrate a corpse having killed the person in order to make the film. It is to prevent and discourage that behaviour and the behaviour of individuals commiting these criminal acts, the genuninely harmful behaviour that stuatute is enacted. The reason behind the statute is reasonable and I don't think it is censorship if the mellodramatic way he is describing.

As for the rather amusing parrot anecdote, you have to bear in mind that the greyer areas of statute are filled out by case law and your intial example of the tiger shows this. The photo of the parrot is not being shown for the purpose of sexual gratification but rather amusement in the same way the tiger video was a joke, ergo the parrot picture is not extreme pronography unless it is distributed as pornography. Furthermore, you did not engage, as such, with the parrot. It molested you. You had no mens rea with regard to it, so the requisite intention is not there.

It's a moron tax. Anyone who gets gas from BG deserves fleecing. British Gas can't undercut the other gas providers due to it's monopoly position, just in the same way that BT can't undercut other telephone companies.

It's quite easy to fix. Find a [switching](http://www.uswitch.com/) site or something and find out what works for you. Work out what your gas consumption is (protip: read your meter periodically and contest their estimates till you get accurate bills) and electricity and see if you can get it cheaper with both.

Wait, switched in the last 6 months and still bawwing? Ok, the [Energy Saving Trust](http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Easy-ways-to-stop-wasting-energy/Energy-saving-grants-and-offers) has some details on grants. In many cases people can get %50 of their insulation costs back. If you don't have loft insulation you shouldn't complain about high gas prices. If you don't have cavity insulation you shouldn't complain about high gas prices. The cost of insulation is returned in less than a few years.

Most of my house is double glazed and toasty, but my living room backs onto a conservatory with a door with gaps in it and a single glazed window so I accept that my gas bills will be higher than they could be. In a year or two, we're going to take the radiator off the wall, fit double glazed patio doors where the window is and swap the internal doors around to insulate individual rooms, reducing the cost of getting it done to zero over about 6 years.

To all those going on about nationalising gas, if you take away the competition then there's no pressure to drop prices and the cost of gas simply becomes another form of tax.

true,FreeManAndHisWoof,null,null,"It's perfectly ""Legal"" (under Statute / Act / Code / By-law) and lawful (at common law), but equally (depending on specifics) may be objected to, and that objection also establishes the law - that there is no contract in place and no consent was made.

That sounds confusing, so let me explain, firstly giving the example of where you are bound to pay for a ""parking ticket"" and how you become bound, then giving an example of where there is no binding and so can be objected to (such as stopping on a common street)...

**A.** If you enter onto private land (such as a car park) and that land is open to the public so that you are free (free will / voluntary) to enter, then for the benefit-privilege of using that private property (the land) it must be adequately Noticed (on signs) the Fee Schedule (costs) for partaking in the use of that private property to anyone who may wish to use it.

That ""Notice"" in public (on private land but given public notice to anyone who enters) of costs is a ""Claim"" and includes a ""Fee Schedule"", and that Claim is the Law.

This is private land, so if you object to it, you have the option (the freedom / free will) to leave and not use this private property.

If you choose to park your car there, then you are ""assumed"" to have contracted under the terms and conditions of the Noticed Claim (the Law of the property owner). - You have consented to private law.

If you pay a penny then you have contracted for sure.  If you pay a penny then do not pay further and overstay your time, then you have breached your contract and you can be held liable (lien-able) - a lien (""security interest"") may be placed upon your properties of the same amount to cover the costs of retrieving the monies owed.

Council land is private land - land owned by the corporation that runs the council.  There are often ""By-laws"" on the use of council land and other notices.  Such land is not common land, even if it is open to the public.

**B.** Now... imagine that it is not private land upon which you park upon, but is the common street (except for dual carriage-ways and motorways which is land in Trust).

If you stop your automobile at the side of the road, and it is not interfering with the usage (common) and traffic (commerce) upon that road, then you may leave your car there at no cost to anyone.

If someone (a council / traffic warden or anyone) comes around and puts a ticket on your car wanting you to pay them money, then they have no lawful claim for that (at common law).

If you remain in honour and return their gift / property back to them (the piece of paper - demand for dough), and to remain in honour let them know that you'd be happy to pay so long as they present a ""proof of claim"" that you have voluntarily &amp; willfully consented to their terms and conditions and have thereby contracted, but that you have no knowledge of ever having entered into contract with them, then they will have to present a ""proof of claim"" or else they are then acting lawfully.  A ""proof of claim"" in such a case would have to be proof of you having some kind of contract with them or something like that with your signature on saying you want the service they offered you (putting a ticket on the car), which wouldn't exist.

Don't just say that you won't pay etc, as that is argumental and dishonourable, and leaves them no remedy or recourse for their claim (even if it isn't a valid claim).  Be sure in your replies (counter-notice / counter-claim by notice) to offer to settle it in the possibility that their claim was valid.  If it then goes to the court, this shows that you remained in honour at all times and intended to settle.

Basically, they have no jurisdiction over you, except by your consent. That consent may be your silence - known as ""tacit acceptance"", ""silent acquiescence"" and ""*estoppel* by silence"".

In law, when someone makes a claim against you by notice (such as a demand etc.), then what is not explicitly disagreed is agreed by tacit acceptance / silent acquiesence / estoppel by silence.  This is very sneaky, and works not only to establish binding law between individuals outside of the courts on the street (such as council parking tickets on common streets), but also in the courts, - always counterclaim and object to their claim, even when they call you a ""driver"", ""citizen"", ""res-ident"", ""tax-payer"" etc which are all *subject* status under some body of Law predetermined simply by accepting that you are standing in that role (""driver"", ""citizen"", ""res-ident"", ""tax-payer"" etc).

Many tickets have been rejected in this way.  But some people are still fundamentally getting it wrong after failing to know correctly what to do, taking up a subjective standing, or causing controversy (dishonour).

Or they fail to know what to do next when the council ignores you and send bailiffs out.  Then you'd have to know how to immediately make a claim in a ""[court of record](http://www.reddit.com/r/CLVideos/comments/93sxh/bill_thornton/c0id4of)"" (a court proceeding according to the common law) to make them stop immediately.  That's more difficult as it isn't a simple matter of just showing up, though not too difficult, so long as you know how to do at least 3 things.

Hope I explained it adequately and wasn't over simplifying anything.

I disagree with them on the points where they think treason has been done.

The parallels are the same.  In their case too they achieved the extension of power through individual voluntary standing in commerce which they are empowered to regulate.

Now in the U.S., when you buy anything or rewire your house or fit a new toilet, it is said you are in inter-state commerce, and that is upheld in court as when you do that you are not using lawful money such as gold, silver, something of substance or bank notes that are redeemable in something of substance like silver, but you are using private notes issued by a bank that are not redeemable in silver, therefore having no value at common law (therefore incapable of settling any debt true, clear and outright), and so can only be used as a ""commercial instrument"", therefore you are operating voluntarily in commerce and the Federal Government takes jurisdiction over you.

My own opinion is that it should restrict its remit to information and education (so keep all the news, science, learning content) and dump the more entertainment-oriented content.  I personally *love* BBC food content, but do they have a mandate to be in that area?  Sadly, probably not so much.  Possibly it could be squeezed in along with gardening under ""science"" somehow.

\1. Correctly establish your standing as ""one of the people"", and not from the outset as a *subject* of their claim, such as a ""driver"", ""citizen"", ""resident"" depending on what their claim is about ( - object to being named any such created role).

\2. Establish the ""court of record"" so that you retain the right to stand as tribunal, unless agreed to go to jury that will be the tribunal, but either way, not surrendering that right to the Judge / Magistrate.

...that's just one sentence, also may be known as a ""special appearance"" though that may sometimes be unclear to the participants in the court.  And...

\3. Challenging jurisdiction by ask them to present a ""proof of claim"" of authority or jurisdiction over you, such as ""bring forth the contract"".

Why? Because, **if you fail to do**...

(1.) you may submit to the plaintiff's claim simply be admitting you are standing in a created role (""driver"", ""citizen"", ""res-ident"") over which they have jurisdiction.

(2.) you stand before a court that may proceed according to the plaintiff's claim, and it assumed by your silence - your failure to object to the court established (tacit acceptance / silent acquiescence) - that you consent to the court proceeding as though the jurisdiction of the plaintiff is accepted, only be argued thereunder.

(3.) you accept the plaintiff's claim by failing to object to it or challenge the basis of the claim (i.e. the jurisdiction / authority itself).  What is not disagreed is agreed. - This is known as tacit acceptance, silent acquiescence, or estoppel by silence (though that term is used more often with notices not replied to before getting to the court, though the concept is the same).

Successfully challenging jurisdiction like this, then the case will be dismissed.  There will be no case (the other party has failed in their claim against you).

Failed counterclaims always leave out one or more of these.

Four.  You could go further, and claim for damages in your counterclaim, caused by them making a frivolous case against you and wasting your time and resources.  Make a claim for a certain amount depending on what you think adequate compensation is.  If the challenge to jurisdiction is successful (the original plaintiff could not show that you had consented to or agreed to his claimed ""Law""), then the case will proceed considering your claim for damages, it's just a matter of coming to an agreement through the help of the court of record (proceeding according to the common law).

true,FreeManAndHisWoof,null,null,"Note that code is a subset of what is written.

Much of the constitution is written, not as a single document, but as a number of documents and records, though some of it remains uncodified.

The declaration that is the Magna Carta of 1215 was originally officially accepted and codified as the Confirmatio Cartarum in 1297, though the original codification as a statute (internal document / code) has now largely been repealed. That is the Confirmation Cartarum of 1297 (also confusingly known by the name of Magna Carta, though of 1297) has been recodified into other Statutes and Acts to reflect the original declared charter in 1215.

The Confirmation Cartarum of 1297 (Magna Carta of 1297) may be repealed as the government was the author of it, but the Magna Carta of 1215 cannot be repealed as it was not written by the government.

Likewise, the Order that is the Declaration of Rights of 1688 was officially accepted and codified as the Bill of Rights of 1689 (a statute / internal document / code).

The Bill of Rights of 1689 may be replaced (recodified) with more modern Statutes and Acts, but the Declaration of Rights of 1688 on which the Bill was drawn thereafter may not be repealed by the government as they are not the author of it.

In this way the Constitution does as it was designed to do and is supposed to do; it limits the power, domain and jurisdiction of any governing Body on the People (""free men"") of these lands, so long as the People hold the government and its agents / officers liable to it.

The influence of Magna Carta can be clearly seen in the United States Bill of Rights, which enumerates various rights of the people and restrictions on government power, such as:

""*No person shall be ... deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.*""

Article 21 from the Declaration of Rights in the Maryland Constitution of 1776 reads:

""*That no freeman ought to be taken, or imprisoned, or disseized of his freehold, liberties, or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any manner destroyed, or deprived of his life, liberty, or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.*""

&gt;UKRedditors: ASBOrometer - Measure **UK** Anti-Social Behaviour On iPhone And Android

..

&gt;ASBOrometer is a mobile application that measures levels of anti-social behaviour at your current location (**within England and Wales**) and gives you access to key local ASB statistics.


Quite happy for you to post article to the whole of the UK - the whole of the world if you like.

It is what you claimed in the title the App did - measure the whole of the UK, while quite clearly it doesn't. I thought that I had made that point quite clear in my first comment - I didn't realise I needed to spell it out quite so clearly.

You are not alone here - daily the BBC and ITV report stories relating to England (or England &amp; Wales) as UK stories. In the run up to the election just watch how many times Brown, Cameron or Clegg will pronounce on something relating to education, trransport, health and various other things which are now devolved. Just listen and see if the BBC or Channel 4 or ITV bother to delineate between Westminster/Holyrood/Welsh Assembly/NI Assembly matters.

Plus it does grate when the equation

England = Britain = UK = England

seems to be implied. Americans are always doing this, but they have stupidity as an excuse.

I did add a smiley to try and show I wasn't at the seething, steam coming out of my ears stage - just a bit piqued. :)

 about provision contained in the bill regarding the blocking of all P2P software and content distribution ( including flash )  software downloads and application distribution over wifi-networks. 

**Here's his response:** 

This refers to provisions aimed at ending open wi-fi and where public
terminals are provided (rather than what you do on closed networks -
although obviously other provisions of the Bill will apply there in terms of
being held accountable for any content accessed or downloaded that is
perceived as breach of someone's copyright).

From what I can work out, someone has taken a policy document from
Westminster public library and then attempted to turn that into a generic
set of guidance, without understanding the consequences. 

The detailed guidance from which my quote is taken is available from BIS
here -

http://interactive.bis.gov.uk/digitalbritain/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Example-infringement-notifications.pdf

 You'll notice some other oddities - such
as banning Flash.

There are a lot of strange things around this Bill, reflecting that fact it
seems to have been put together quickly without consulting widely first -
with the result that they are trying to fix it on the fly, even though some
of the underlying principles seem to be in denial of the whole point of the
Internet.

Let me know if you have some specific questions - I'm working with a variety
of people reading through it all and trying to work out what it's intended
to do, and what it will actually do given the way some of it is currently
structured.

With best regards,

true,bowling4meth,english,Straight out of Surrey,"Here's the thing. This is a good idea. Over the past decade or so the BBC has been pumped with extra cash alongside a requirement to push the boundaries in some areas, such as DAB, Digital TV and iPlayer.

This has had a knock-on effect on industry. Unfortunately all of this has cost money, and the people that pay for it are you.

To paraphrase their own statements, because of the unique way the BBC is funded there's no actual requirement to deliver things in a cost-effective manner. Subsequently the BBC bleat about the costs of ""talent"" like Johnathan Ross (and Friday Night with Johnathan Ross is something I've found entertaining from time to time, but is he really worth 'that' much?) and are [hemorrhaging money](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8536356.stm) like it's going out of fashion.

Another way to look at it is that in order to watch live television (regardless of whether or not you watch the BBC) you have to pay for a licence. For the elderly this works out at about £5.50/week. The same people may be paying around £5 a week for Gas, Electricity or water. Television shouldn't be a choice between watching cash in the attic and keeping warm.

Yet another way of looking at it is to look at what's being delivered. Currently we're paying for the BBC to deliver 7 major national radio stations, several minor national radio stations, countless regional radio stations, four national entertainment TV stations, an international news desk running various tv and radio stations worldwide, the largest Internet media streaming portal in the country, one of the most popular news and media web sites in the country and live streaming in addition to peripheral features such as orchestras, film funding and other miscellaneous bits. All of the commercial stations that have tried to keep up with the BBC's expansion (with the exception of Murdoch) are overstretched. ITV is massively overextended and suffering for it, Channel 4 has over-extended and was reliant on Big Brother both as a source of revenue and filled air time. The only people who aren't doing that badly are those that haven't tried too hard (such as 5 who are as crap as they always were, but are at least consistently crap) and minor channels such as Dave (who are actually turning out to be one of the best channels on freeview by recycling BBC content). The BBC needs to scale back and change it's model, the current one is not sustainable for itself and threatens free market competition. By reducing what the BBC are needed to deliver, cost savings can be made and the BBC can get back to doing what it does best, namely brilliant original content like Blackadder, Documentaries that educate instead of tittilate and Doctor Who instead of imported series like Heroes and shite like the weakest link.",0,1267398186,null,0,false,0,c0lcqxz,t3_b6te2,t1_c0lcqxz,t3_b6te2,null,1426228078,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
