null,false,kruxlsi,null,null,null,"""Der Spiegel"" is a very renowned magazine in germany. I doubt it needs more attention (in germany). 

The editor in chief already stated the cover should be seen as satire, with Merkel crudely pasted into it, as can be seen by the bad cut out picture of her.

What satire you ask? Well, der Spiegel wants to adress the perceived leadership of germany as viewed by other European states (""How Europeans view the Germans"" as stated on the cover), while at the same time put this into a historical context and how this context could lead to problems both as perceived by the germans or by other countries - take for example the Greeks, of which some blamed Merkel for her role in their country's financial situation.

I don't doubt ""Der Spiegel"" chooses its covers in part to provoke attention and initiate discussion, but that's what this magazine has always done.

In reality the flag has a long evolution

1. The ultimate source is [the naval flag of the Russian Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Navy_Ensign#/media/File:Naval_Ensign_of_Russia.svg) created in 1712. The cross comes from the Cross of St. Andrew, as [Order of St. Andrew](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_St._Andrew#/media/File:Badge_to_Order_St_Andrew_both_sides.jpg) was the highest order of Chivalry in the Russian Empire. The cross of St. Andrew also happens to be in the [flag of Scotland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Scotland.svg).

2. The naval flag of Russia was the inspiration for [the flag of the Neva Yacht Club](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neva_Yacht_Club#/media/File:Nevskyflot1.png) of St. Petersburg founded in 1718. The Neva Yacht Club is one of the oldest in the world and the flag was apparently designed by the czar himself.

3. The Naval flag of Russia was the inspiration for the modified [Finnish merchant navy flag](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Alkuperalippu.svg) used during the Crimean war in the 19th century. It was the first flag used especially by Finns.

4. The Neva Yacht Club flag &amp; the Finnish Merchant Flag was the inspiration for the [flag of Nylands Yacht Club](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyl%C3%A4ndska_Jaktklubben#/media/File:Flag_of_Nyland_Yacht_Club.png) in Helsinki. This and the Finnish merchant navy flag became the inspiration for all Finnish yacht club flags.

When Finland declared independence, there were tons of suggestions for the Finnish flag, but in the end the blue cross flags already widely used by sailors influenced the approved design.",null,0,null,1426980518,null,0,false,0,cpmg3ve,null,t3_2ztl55,null,t1_cpmg3ve,null,t3_2ztl55,null,null,null,1431939065,null,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7,null

Finally it doesn't matter if you are convinced or not. The truth can be easily tracked nowadays. 
Just dig a bit harder and don't fall for easy answers given by magazines or tabloids.
As I said before, personally I think they (reparations) should be forgotten/forgiven. Not an easy thing though when tabloids over there don't miss a chance to criticize and ridicule us.

It has become an art for some to have ""the high morality ground"" stance and criticizing us so easily. 
Truly disgusting. 
What better example than the one with the Goethe Institut? 
How idiotic people must be to even think that those 4 Greeks who lost everything in Distomo would agree in anyway whatsoever for their case to be used as a leverage by theirvery  own government? 

How much of a lowlife one must be not to see the obvious that these people would be the first to ridicule the Greek government if they used their pain as a leverage?
One should only take a minute to see what they suffered and then graciously shut the fuck up.

null,false,bakuninsbart,EURO,Germany,null,"&gt; It's not about EU itself but all those time when EU is overridden by the members' sovereignty. And when that happens Germany takes upon itself the role of higher power. Who do you go to if you're supposed to negotiate something with EU? Merkel. Who goes up to meet with Putin when shit hits the fan? Merkel. 

When a country has a reasonable economic outlook, the EU is ready to look over treaty infringements. - See Luxembourg, France, or Germany. When a country has a negative outlook, the others don't want to drag them along for a very long time. It is true that countries like Finland, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic or Slowakia look to Germany first for these matters (specifically austerity). But the same way, Portugal, Spain and Greece look to France for a lowering in austerity measures. 

Dominance is just way too strong a word to describe the german relationships and clouts in Europe. 

&gt; It's not about who's the strictest but about how much clout they have. Germany thanks to its status starts off with the upper hand in an ever so shaky scenario where EU countries sometimes are a union and sometimes they're each on their own.

Germany has no ways of forcing any country to do anything. If other creditor countries would decide that the austerity policies failed, surely Germany would have to give in. Nothing happened to countries that didn't sign harsh bailout terms. There is a lot of shouting about France, Italy or Britain, but these countries completely design there own policies. We are talking about fractions of power projection here. 

And debtor countries have the possibility of defaulting, but it would wreck their economies even more. This does give a big amount of power to creditor countries - of which Gerrmany is the biggest, but again, dominance is just way too strong of a word for this. 

Furthermore, Germany is politically divided. Having Merkel as chancellor for so long helps paint a picture of a monolithic block, but this is certainly not the case!

The media is eager to paint an easily understandable scenario, so they go with german dominance.

In den meisten Fällen ist Ungleichbehandlung von Männern nur die Kehrseite der Ungleichbehandlung von Frauen. Beispiel: Ich kriege durchaus schiefe Blicke, weil ich arbeite, obwohl ich zwei kleine Kinder habe. Würde mein Mann aber seinen Beruf aufgeben, um Hausmann zu sein, dann würde das die Leute auch entsprechend konsternieren, und da würde auch hinter seinem Rücken über ihn getuschelt werden (habe ich schon in Bezug auf andere Männer erlebt). In der Beziehung steckt Deutschland (zumindest im Westen und ganz [besonders im Süden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bTKSin4JN4&amp;t=30m)) noch halb in den 50er Jahren.

Vereinfacht gesagt, wird Männern mehr professionelle/technische und Frauen mehr emotionale/soziale Kompetenz unterstellt (und umgekehrt wird oft Frauen professionelle und Männern emotionale Kompetenz abgesprochen). 

Auch was zum Beispiel den Männeranteil in Kindererziehung und Pflegeberufen anbetrifft, ließe sich einiges verbessern. Gerade im Erziehungsbereich sind männliche Erzieher wichtig, allein wegen ihrer Vorbildfunktion für Jungen.

Nur hat das vermutlich außer mit veralteten Rollenbildern viel mehr damit zu tun, dass diese Berufe schlicht und einfach unterbezahlt sind (es ist schon merkwürdig, wie gerade in Erziehungsberufen der Frauenanteil schrumpft, wenn die Bezahlung steigt). Daher wird auch die klischeehafteste Militantfeministin damit keine Probleme haben: Je mehr Männer sich mit schlechtbezahlten Berufen zufriedengeben, um so mehr Möglichkeiten ergeben sich logischerweise für Frauen am oberen Ende der Gehaltsskala.

&gt; Frauen können jeden technischen Beruf ergreifen den sie wollen, tun es aber nicht weill die meisten einfach andere Interessen haben.

Für diese Behauptung hätte ich gerne einen Beleg.

Gegenbeispiel: In den USA ist der Frauenanteil bei den Informatikabschlüssen in weniger als dreißig Jahren von 37.1% auf unter 12% zurückgegangen [1].

Zwischen 1984 und 2011 kann einiges passiert sein, was das verursacht hat, aber die Biologie des weiblichen Gehirns hat sich in der Zeit mit Sicherheit nicht so sehr verändert. So schnell kann die Evolution gar nicht arbeiten.

Auch die Erfahrungen mit transsexuellen Wissenschaftlern [und ihrer Ungleichbehandlung vorher und nachher](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115274744775305134) deutet stark darauf an, dass die Ungleichheit mit ziemlicher Sicherheit nicht nur biologisch bedingt ist, sondern dass da eine starke soziale Komponente mit einfließt.

Il y a certes des différences notables entre régions, mais il y a quand même certaines constantes. Les français sont très individualistes et rechignent au civisme s'ils n'y sont pas forcés et contraints.

Germany implements some protectionist economic policies because for now it can get away with it, ever reliant on its powerful export market. The UK simply doesn't have that option so it has to deal with world finance to a greater degree. That said if you don't think billions in Chinese, Russian and Arab currency isn't being invested in Germany every year then you'd be mistaken. 

I can't even tell what your point is, that it's somehow bad that Quatar is putting money into London? Because that's a very good think unless you think Britain should be an insular economy that resists investment on the grounds of looking after people who were born in Britain. Seems totally absurd. 

The British banking sector is vastly more powerful than any other European country, especially Germany, and all the best German bankers have already packed up and moved to London from Frankfurt. It's easy to hate the banks for the recession, but nobody was saying that before when they rolling in cash. There's nothing inherently wrong with banking, it's now picking up again and everyone will be singing their praises for bringing more prosperity to the UK.",null,0,null,1426981846,null,0,1426982288,0,cpmgqt5,null,t3_2zu3mr,null,t1_cpmgqt5,null,t1_cpmgib7,null,null,null,1431939365,null,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7,null

Ce qui fait la différence entre nos sociétés, c'est une vraie volonté, de la part des gens et du gouvernement d'investir du temps ou de l'argent dans l'amélioration de leur cadre de vie sans retour immédiat.

Il faut les infrastructures pour assurer la propreté et l'hygiène dans les villes, il faut que les gens aient en tête le bien-être d'autrui, même en dehors de leur famille et c'est pas évident quand on essaie avant tout de survivre.

Mais même, je comprends la réflexion d'OP, y'a des gestes pas difficiles à faire (jeter ses détritus dans une poubelle et non par terre, ne pas cracher dans la rue, ne pas agresser physiquement ou verbalement les gens dès le moindre regard de travers) et là, ça ne coûte rien, le manque de civisme leur coûte même beaucoup mais c'est plus un manque d'éducation ou la culture à laquelle ils appartiennent (pas forcément celle du pays d'origine de leurs grand-parents dont ils ne connaissent rien, parfois la culture gangster ou banlieue qu'ils veulent reproduire) qui posent problème.

D'ailleurs c'est (pas) marrant mais on le voit en France, plus la situation du pays se dégrade, plus le communautarisme et les extrêmes se développent pendant que le civisme recule.

It stands for unity and independence of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. [On special occassions \(royalty related\) we attach a thin orange banner to the top - this symbolizes the royal family.](http://www.ronddelinge.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/website-vlaggen-nationale-vlaggen.jpg)

A short history:

The flag of the Netherlands is the oldest tricolor still in use, dating back to around 1572. Back then we were using two versions: the orange-white-blue *Prinsenvlag* and the red-white-blue *Hollandsche vlag*, also known as the *Statenvlag*. In 1579 the Prinsenvlag became the official flag of the Dutch Republic and around 1653 and onward the Statenvlag became the official one. Both flags were however used throughout the republic due to the constant conflict between the republicans (Statenvlag) and the orangists (Prinsenvlag).

It isn't 100% clear where the colours exactly came from. Some sources say from the coat of arms of Willem van Oranje and other sources claim they come from the coat of arms of the Dukes of Holland. Other sources claim that red-white-blue were already used in the Dutch coastal regions during the time of Charlemagne.

In the 1930's the NSB nazi party started claiming that the Prinsenvlag was the real flag of the Netherlands. There wasn't really any clear law denying that, which lead to a Royal Decree in 1937 that made the red-white-blue the official colours of our national flag.",null,0,null,1426982557,null,0,false,0,cpmh2uv,null,t3_2ztl55,null,t1_cpmh2uv,null,t1_cpm9vba,null,null,null,1431939524,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

null,false,WorldLeader,UNSA,United States of America,null,"To save you from the wall of text, here are the author's three main points: 

* Too many vocab words
* ambiguous syntax
* unclear pronunciation

I'd say in response that while yes, there are a ton of vocab words in the English language, most people do not encounter obscure words of forms of words often in daily life. You only really see extended vocab in literature, poetry, art and philosophy. Simple English is easy to use for basic communication. 

Secondly, syntax is certainly fluid. You can form a sentence or phrase a myriad of ways. While this is certainly the most salient point in the article, it shouldn't hinder scientific communication where instructions and methods are often written in bullet point or list form.

Finally, pronunciation is actually a strength, not a weakness, of English. The fact that multiple countries use English successfully and can say words differently shows that it is easy to understand, even if the speaker is just starting. For instance, when in France my French wasn't very good, but people literally couldn't understand me because they said that my accent was wrong. In English, you can mis-pronounce half the words in a sentence and most people will get the gist. 

Bonus point: English has no central language authority, as opposed to the majority of other languages ([see for yourself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_language_regulators)), thus it can evolve much quicker and new technology can be described without issue using new terminology. This gives English the upper-hand since it is essentially an ""open-source"" language, and you can add words as needed.

null,false,kingofeggsandwiches,UKGB,United Kingdom,null,"I'm sorry but that level of naïveté is unbelievable. It's the kind of thing  you hear from social science 1st year undergrads who lack the remotest understanding of economics. The progress of the last hundred years is the direct result of the uptake of modern capitalism and then a fiat monetary system. The alternatives we have are old fashioned goods backed currency, a system that massively favours the rich in allowing them to keep their money in a vault without the need for money to circulate to retain its value. Banks are the reason why money circulates and society moves forward. Alternatively there is communism which ultimately puts control of labour and production in the hands of politicians who are certainly no better than the banks when it comes to greed and corruption.

&gt;It's completely detached from the people and businesses that actually produce real value,

This is complete bollocks that only people who don't understand what banks do say. If I mine coal out of the ground and sell it I create value by introducing my goods in the economy, if I run a concierge service for rich business men I am selling a service and creating value. If I run a bank I am selling a service whereby I provide you a return on your investment through the interest you get on your money. I take on risk like any businessman in the belief that I will, through skills and ability, make a return on my overall venture in order to be able to pay your interest. Banks provide a lot of real value to the economy and that is why they make so much money. Moreover they have a useful function within society at a meta level insofar as they provide people who have a means to generate money at an interest beating rate to have access to all the capital they could desire, meaning that that profit generation will expand to whatever level it is able to. This is literally how money is generated, not monopoly money that will decrease the overall value of the currency, but real money back by the real value whatever is generating that profit is providing. To suggest otherwise is absurd.

&gt;but is still able to fuck up everything without having to fear of real punishment. All while using it's power to block every attempt to regulate and repair a broken system.

These are nothing to do with banking itself, although they might be true some cases. It's up to legislators to regulate the banks and not allow them to survive if uncompetitive or corrupt. There is nothing inherently bad about banking at all, and if you believe otherwise you're an idiot. I'll also add that I'm not defending bad banking like what happened in 2007, but the idea that because bad banking occurs then banking is bad is just the most obvious of logical fallacies going. Banking is here to stay, people should be thinking about how to ensure good high profit, sensible risk banking rather than bashing the notion of banking as inherently corrupt. It's this type of absurd believe that allows banks to be bad in the first place out of a sense of resignation to a less than optimal situation.

My first contact with it was due to the Musterung. My mental health problems started to show up and the and the answer from them was essentially 'we'll wait a year for reevaluation and you have to seek out a therapist. or we will force you into a therapy'. Nice for a 15 year old boy, isn't it? (before any native germans are wondering: I was 15 due to them using year of birth rather than date of birth)  

But in general: everything except from the Sozialamt cares a shit about it. You have trouble keeping up with your forms, are in the middle of crisis and have no one to help you with them? Well, you are completely out of luck.  
And even then the different agencies, especially the Arbeitsamt/Jobcenter, don't even know about their own rules regarding these cases and regularily break the law when passing their own judgement.

Since the Sozialamt is the last resort for people with mental health problems they are the only ones competent and patient enough to handle these cases with care.

Now to the point of accesibility.  
Therapeutic measures are easier to access the more severe the condition/current crisis is.   
Getting a psychiatrist for medication is easier the more severe the situation is - with university/hospital psychiatrists being the last meassure when not being able to get hold of a regular neurologist/psychiatrist (also known as PIA - Psychiatrische Institutsambulanz). They also tend to take better care of their patients and keep a closer eye on them from calling in up to sending people to look if you are well for missed appointments.  
Getting a therapy, especially a dedicated specialiced therapy is also easier under the same premise.  
That being said: generally, the mental health hospital wards while having gotten better, are often unable to keep up. Be it with the demand of space (since also many drunken people are often sent there to get sobber or the many demented elderly shoved there because most homes for elderly just can't handle it) or the demand of attention to the individual patient. Which also often leads to overextended stays, which has several negative sideffects.  
So for people in the beginning stages help is often hard to come by. For one due to the few free spaces at therapists and on the other hand due to the sheer number of programms/govermental help/available therapies so people don't easily know where to turn to. People in 'the middle of it' have it easier due to the Sozialamt or Sozialpsychiatrischer Dienst already being involved and thus having more resources.

And lastly for the social aspect.  
I like to call it a farce. With lot's of cant.  
With suicides from prominent football players (like Enke or Bierman) depression becomes a topic every few years. Many cry out and pledge to be more supportive but nothing changes. But other psychological problems aren't even tackled by the discourse. So lots and lots of hypocrisy.   
On the one hand I get angry at this and on the other hand I can't realy blame the population after years of toxic indoctrination from the political party FDP. They are the toxic equivalent for jobseeking/handicapped people like the CDU/CSU is for immigrants/social minorities.  
And as many people with mental health problems aren't able to work we are the scum of the earth to the general population. We life in the shadows - not to be seen apart from the occasional schizophrenic person loudly talking to the ghosts that haunt 'em at the cash register. Who is often met with disgust.  
The stigma is still great and as such even seeking out help or confiding into others is a great problem.

And even subcultures like the LGBT community which due to especially trans people having many psychological problems should be expected to be more open about it are especially bad and hypocritical in this regard. Only trans people get support or understanding. Everyone else...well, tough luck. 'Don't stick your dick in the crazy' runs especially hard here. And while I fully understand that not everyone is confident in handling people with stark psycological problems, even I want to cuddle -_- (not even talking sex here)
So while the loneliness can't be curbed, the LGBT community here in germany leaves me no other choice than trying to accept it.

It just seems too strange. I can understand large federations where the individual parts retain some larger measure of independence. But with out three countries, how could it possibly work? A federation is always extra difficulty, so it needs some benefits to offset the difficulty. In our case, just the language alone would be difficult - we don't understand each other's languages, so we would need everything in three languages. That prevents us from saving money on, say, health care or education, the language overhead would already be more expensive. And with many younger people who do not speak Russian and many older people who do not speak English, we'd have many citizens in this federation who are completely unable to communicate with many other citizens!

It would turn us into modern day Bosnia, a country with a horribly complicated government system. Going from our current population of 2 million to a population of 6 million isn't enough to see the benefits of federalization, and this resulting country would still have a smaller population that Sweden, Belgium or Netherlands, and not much above Finland.

Essentially the book argues that liberals and especially left wing liberals (I.e. socialists and social democrats) should stop seeing other cultures as intrinsically different and stand up for human rights and social progress no matter where or for who. But more specifically it's arguing that the War in Iraq under Tony Blair and George Bush Jr. Was essentially a good thing (or at least, not a bad thing) in the same way standing up to Serbia in the Break up of Yugoslavia was a good thing and standing up to Hitler in WWII was a good thing. 

I've since started reading *The Orange Book; Reclaiming Liberalism* which was written in 2004 four by quite bunch of senior members of the Liberal Democrats who would eventually become leaders of the party. For instance, I just read the section by Nick Clegg on the European Union today where he set out a lot of very interesting criticisms of the EU but from an intensely pro-European perspective. He argued in favour of giving the EU primacy over foreign affairs and much else (very interesting, coming from the now deputy prime minister of the UK) but also that the EU Parliament's role should be diminished in favour of increasing the role of national governments and parliaments in EU legislation due to the lack of a real EU *demos*. Looking forward to reading the chapter by Vince Cable on economic social justice and what that means to him. 

I've also got Tony Blair's biography out of the library to read but am not really looking forward to it. The thing is huge.

**The Latin motto** ""E Pluribus Unum"" appeared on the title page of the annual volume of the Gentleman's Magazine or Monthly Intelligencer – next to a drawing of a hand holding a bouquet of different flowers. 

""America was originally likened to a bouquet of different flowers, where unity and individuality coexisted – not a ""melting pot"" that blended everyone together.""

Fun Facts About E Pluribus Unum
Just as the U.S. has thirteen original colonies, E Pluribus Unum has thirteen letters in it.

**The term ex pluribus unum (a minor variation) dates to ancient times, where [Saint Augustine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) uses it in his c. 397-398 Confessions (Book IV.)**

E Pluribus Unum still appears on U.S. coins even though it is no longer the official national motto! That honor was given to In God We Trust in 1956 by an Act of Congress (36 U.S.C. § 302.)

 [**Terrone**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrone): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Terrone__ (plural: *terroni*) is a term of the [Italian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language), used by the inhabitants of [northern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Italy) and [central Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Italy) as derogatory to designate an inhabitant of [southern Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Italy).

&gt;The term comes from the word ""terra"" ([Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language) for land) and it was historically used, after the unification of Italy, to describe the [landlords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landlord) of the former [Kingdom of the Two Sicilies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_the_Two_Sicilies), highlighting the fact that they profited from a land property (the so-called ""latifondo"") without working. This epithet is often associated with negative personal characteristics, such as laziness and ignorance. Similarly, especially in some slang, the term has taken on the meaning of peasant, rude person.

&gt;In addition, with the term are often associated somatic and physical traits, like an olive skin, short stature, high cheeks, characteristics historically predominant in the south of Italy.

There is a slight chance for a goverment bailout for him, so don't cry for him, Reddit.

- A Hungarian Air Force Grippen [emergency landed](http://www.hirado.hu/2015/03/20/biztonsagi-okbol-kassan-landolt-a-magyar-honvedseg-egyik-gripenje/) at Kosice on its way back from a training mission in Sweden.

- Lajos Simicska, the new anti-Orban oligarch (former BFF) was being [tortured](http://nol.hu/belfold/simicska-most-beszelni-is-alig-tudott-1523443) by his dentist. (Stupid joke by the Hungarian media about Simicska, who said that Orban will assasinate him.)

- Orban's youth organisation, Fidelitas wanted to establish a public database about the address and photos of [opposition provocateurs](http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20150321-orbannak-is-ellentmondott-a-fidelitas.html) who ruin their rallies. Fidesz spent cca. a decade before 2010 with shadowing socialist politicians to ruin their rallies with shouts and whistles. A clown [even attacked former PM Bajnai](http://radioeger.hu/news/993.jpg), who was called a clown by the Fidesz in 2014. Orban even shadowed Socialist PMs in Brussels. He always had some job to do in the same city where Medgyessy or Gyurcsany was.
But enough from lefty weeping, here is a video where the Fidesz fans handle the provocation last Sunday. As one of them said:[""Provocate your bloody jewish mother!""](https://youtu.be/wj2uFTT5a18)

- Fidesz [dropped](http://nepszava.hu/cikk/1051789-mar-nem-erolteti-a-drogtesztet-a-fidesz) the idea of mandatory drug test for children, journalists and politicians.

##International Politics

###President Poroshenko visits Berlin
- Chancellor Angela Merkel met the Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on the exact anniversary of the annexation
of Crimea. Merkel noted that the illegal annexation has not been forgotten, but the main focus was on the Minsk Agreement 
whose implementation is disappointing. The conversation between Poroshenko and Merkel lasted longer than scheduled. Before the
meeting Poroshenko stated that the Minsk Agreement was more of a hope than reality and that it did not work. Merkel reiterated that
Ukraine must implement the Minsk Agreement to hope for further support. This weekend the Rada will be proposed with a law enshrining
more autonomy to the rebel regions in order to comply with the Minsk Agreement.

###According to Glenn Greenwald Germany has been threatened by the US over Edward Snowden
- During the Siebenpfeiffer-award ceremony - handed to Gleen Greenwald - Energy Minister Sigmar Gabriel had a conversation with Greenwald. According to 
Greenwalds account Gabriel admitted that the US threatened Germany over its relation with Edward Snowden. Gabrial is said to have said that Germany would loose
access to anti-terror information flow if it would provide Snowden with asylum or even just let him into the country. The parliament would like to interview Edward Snowden to 
get a full picture of the NSA activities. The federal government managed to block any such attempts so far.

##Domestic Politics

###Blockupy protests against ECB are background
- Heavy riots started already in the early morning. 7 police cars were set ablaze, garbage has been burned in several locations and two policemen have been injured. The police 
was prepared for riots but did not expect the level of ferocity. The left-wing activists were highly organized and took the police by surprise with their coordinated attempts to 
enter the ECB premises where the inauguration of the the new headquarters took place, but ultimately failed. Protesters also attacked fire-fighters that tried to extinguish the fires. The ""first"" police 
station (they are just numbered sequentially) was temporarily under siege when activists tried to take it. The police had enough manpower to counter, but had its difficulty replying 
to the levels of violence displayed. According to the police 4000 protesters were involved in the violence. A total of 220 people was injured. The main demonstration in the afternoon with 17000 participants 
remained calm.
- According to the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution right-wing activists may have been active during the Blockupy protests. The police did not notice right-wing crimes. 
Eye witnesses report clashes between left-wing and right-wing activists.

##Environment

###Micro-plastic particle pollute water in Bavaria
- According to the Environment Ministry the pollution levels are low to medium. Micro-plastic so far was mostly observed in the
ocean, yet it also appears in lakes and rivers. The particles smaller than 5 millimetres are dangerous to animals who potentially consume them
and eventually through the food chain to humans as well. In the Chiemsee 0.1 Particle per square metre were measured, twice as many as in the 
river Isar. The worst polution was found in the Starnberger See in the shore sediments with 831 particles per square metre.

EDIT: But seriously (though that link wasn't even non-serious): The Tories are some of the worst double-faced lying bastards around. Try to apply their arguments about Scotland to the EU, or the other way round and see what you get. They constantly misrepresent the EU, even more than is done elsewhere, they deliberately do nothing against the even more ridiculous idiocies of UKIP.

You'll see them opposing the Spitzenkandidat system, and in the same breath say that Europe needs to be more democratic. They complain that no Brit got a vote on Juncker: Which is no wonder, the UK is the only country in Europe that doesn't have an EPP member party. The Tories should be that member, if you look at the other ECR members UKIP would fit right in.

Still, like Juncker or not, he has a parliament majority behind him. Who, again, is opposing him in the council? Cameron. Claiming that Europe should be more democratic and at the same time strong-arming in the council to out-maneuver the parliament is pure hypocrisy.

""No Brit even knew the candidates"". Well, yes. Both were told not to come to Britain to campaign, by British parties. In Schulz' case, because Labour was afraid of a campaign against ""their *German* candidate"". In the Tory's case, because they don't want to play with the rest of European conservatives. They *could* have significant say, but they don't want it. Would be harder to complain, then, wouldn't it.

&gt; they just want a reformed EU

Sure it does. There's a difference between giving an opinion as someone random standing outside the White House and being someone who works there. He is not in the head of either Hollande or Merkel. He does not have access to the information they have.

&gt;Le Figaro are just the newspaper publishing the poll results. They didn't conduct the poll, that was by IFOP. 

Not according to the article posted here. I quote:

&gt;A recent poll **conducted by Le Figaro newspaper** put Ms Le Pen's party out in the lead, with 30pc of the vote. 

I note that this 30pc figure is the exact same as on the chart. The article does not seem to support you on this, so no, I don't trust.

&gt;France's recent growth has been good compared to Italy, Portugal or Greece, but bad compared to Germany, UK, USA etc.

So it's been in the middle. Which is kind of what I said, it's not a particularly unique situation. Denmark, where I'm from, remains a stable society that has managed to get through the crisis... but at an alarmingly low rate of growth. Nobody's died here, no big problems. I don't see a reason to use this as an argument for getting someone's nerve system going. Who cares.

I have heard good things about the Independent, but I honestly can't find much more time reading the news. But when I talked about media bias I was imprecise, I meant the presentation of GB in Europe rather than the self-representation - though bias will inherently be found everywhere.

I just think that German media also has a very specific way to portrait GB, even across the political spectrum and that makes it hard to judge the news they print here.

Even reading news from sources with different bias doesn't help much as without boots on the ground it comes done to a ""he says, she says"" and we all know how reliable such arguments are.

So, once again thanks.

Coming back to your first sentence, it is somehow ironic that GB with the greatest ties abroad in Europe prefers to stand alone rather than together.

Les deux équipes nous ont fourni un match électrique, jusqu'au dernière seconde on a eu de l'espoir.

Das bedeutet, dass die eigentliche Arbeit ( Gesetztesentwürfe usw. ) nicht im Plenarsaal stattfindet, sondern in den verschiedenen Ausschüssen. Die allermeisten Abgeordneten sind während der Woche in Berlin um dort zu arbeiten, obwohl du sie nicht siehst. Die Debatten im Parlament sind mehr dazu da um die Bürger zu informieren, und natürlich um Wählerstimmen zu sammeln. Ein Arbeitsparlament hat den Vorteil, dass in den Debatten im Plenarsaal eben nur die Abgeordneten sitzen, die sich mit dem Thema ""auskennen"" ( oder zumindest sollten ). Bei diesem Vorschlag  der Grünen, sind deshalb vermutlich viele vom Gesundheits, vom Innen und vom Rechtsauschuss da. Vom Auschuss für Bildung, Sport, Finanzen natürlich niemand. 

Dann gibt es noch das Redeparlament, dort finden die Debatten über Gesetztesentwürfe im Plenarsaal mit allen Abgeordneten statt.

* US Senat/Kongress

Damit meinte ich eher, das Kranken die UNBEDINGT diese Art von Schmerzmittel brauchen, dass auch bekommen. Natürlich gibt es hier Möglichkeiten zum Missbrauch (Ratet mal, wo ich meinen ersten Joint her hatte), aber im Gesamten ist das eher ein Tropfen auf der Sonne. 

Vorteile einer Dekriminalisierung? Wesentlich weniger Kosten des Staatsapparates und Lösung des Problems das jemand wegen jugendlicher Dummheit einen Eintrag in sein Führungszeugnis o.ä. bekommt. 

Seht es ein, Kiffen ist nicht von Natur aus schlecht, aber genauso ist es von Natur aus nicht schlecht Morphium in der Apotheke kaufen zu können. Problem ist der Missbrauch. Hin und wieder einen Johnny zu rauchen, wer hat da schon etwas dagegen? Mein Problem ist einfach diese degenerierte Kultur die sich dahinter bildet. Stolz darauf zu sein, wake &amp; bake zu machen, obwohl es ja essentiell nichts anderes ist als morgens schon den Whiskey aufzumachen.

Für mich ist jemand, der an mehr Tagen als er arbeitet kifft, praktisch das Kiffen anders behandelt als jetzt mittelschwer betrunken zu sein, degeneriert.

It's easy: First, observe that public transportation already *is* subsidized a lot. Usually, tickets only cover 30% or such of the costs, you're in a better position than me to get at the correct numbers for Paris. In particular, construction also has to be factored in, not just operation. Building metros is *not* cheap.

In general, public transportation without subsidies is impossible, as the prices would be too high compared to cars etc. which is one way to get [American conditions](http://immigrationimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/traffic-jam.jpg). Modern cities are impossible without public transportation, and you'd still have to build expensive roads.

Then, there's *secondary* effects. From lower pollution (exhausts, noise, you name it), lower stress levels because you can make streets narrower, again, planting way more green, people using bikes, your healthcare system is going to thank you. Talking about Paris, the tourism industry is going to *love* you. For tourists, btw, it makes sense to have a levy on hotels, some lump sum per guest per night. Actually, it should be scaled by how expensive the hotel is so that youth hostels and such stay cheap. Four, five Euros on average or such.

Now, it might not be a raw economic gain everywhere, just in most places. But then quality of life is also worth a couple of millions a year. **Do I have to explain that to the French**.

Ecco, su questo evidentemente dissentiamo allora. Lo scenario è spiegato bene [qua](http://theconversation.com/no-youre-not-entitled-to-your-opinion-9978), ma in soldoni l'idea alla base è che, seppur ognuno abbia diritto ad una propria opinione, nessuno ha diritto a vedere le proprie opinioni rispettate o considerate seriamente. E invitare un anti-vaxxer ad un dibattito è rispettarne sufficientemente l'opinione da riproporne una discussione, quando invece l'approccio da seguire è una semplice demolizione della stessa. Per cui, se vuoi fare un approfondimento sulla materia, prendi un medico e al limite gli fai discutere i benefici dei vaccini e l'assoluta assenza di link tra i vaccini e l'autismo. Se qualcuno si lamenta del fatto che alla sua opinione non sia stata data la stessa dignità dell'altra, gli dai un leccalecca e una pacca sulla testa.

My (turkish) friends do consider me quite rude and blunt, the type of jokes I make are different from what they're used to here. on the other hand I find it hard to deal with some of the ""fake politeness"" I encounter here, it seems that in Turkey it's better not to offend people than to be honest with them.

Again i'm not defending it or saying ""deal with it"" but it is definitely something I've noticed living abroad for 2 years, especially in a country like Turkey where social conventions lean towards politeness.

GD have no real power, because they have no real voter base: you have to be a very special kind of crazy to take them remotely seriously. Their recent (very slight really) surge in popularity is the best they'll ever manage. More people than normal voted for them, but only out of desperation and to send a message in a political scene that is temporarily incredibly distorted - now that message has been sent, nobody sees them as a serious, long-term option. People are afraid that if Syriza fails, voters will turn to GD, but I would argue that fear is entirely unfounded. Either way GD will fizzle out, because their message is just too loony.

On the other UKIP has managed to make racist rhetoric appear reasonable. They don't require voters to follow them into the murky dumps of hatred like GD, because they've given hatred a face life and brought it into the mainstream. And voters are falling for it, because it allows them to indulge their worst side without feeling guilty. 

In other words, the reason UKIP is more dangerous than GD is exactly because there are so many more people willing to openly pretend that UKIP is nothing like GD, when it's really just GD led by a clown instead of by thugs: exactly the fact that I have to explain this, as if it's not obvious, as if UKIP are not hateful, lying, populist bigots essentially exactly like GD, exept more insidious and therefore more successful, is what makes them more powerful and so, so much more dangerous.",null,1,null,1427022334,null,0,1427022613,0,cpmu9w7,null,t3_2zsw2t,null,t1_cpmu9w7,null,t1_cpmgz1g,null,null,null,1431945883,null,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0,null

First, fried calçots are rare and hardly traditional. You briefly mentioned roasting them and this is actually what is normally done. usually on an open fire which chars the outer layers.

I didn't encounter anything you are mentioning, yet. I became insterested in the book when I read some notes about it that reminded me of the political situation in Austria right now. The situation here is special in the way that the main political power is still Social Democrat in name. It doesn't make any difference though, because it has been castrated. They will never accomplish anything again. The only goal is to keep as much of what they have, and the way to do that is to be noticed as little as possible, so that they offend as few people as possible. The second, conservative, political power is useless from the start, nowadays all they do is to fight for free money for bankers and farmers.

Everybody is a slave to the economy and all political progress is impossible because of that. Socialists reduce worker benefits to relieve the companies they work for, because the well being of the workers depend on that. The main recent political topic of the left was to reduce labour taxes. Then of course the banking thing. The poorest of society are let down, the poor masses are shut up with money gifts, the ones still well-off shut up on their own because they realize it could be worse.

This is on their [website](http://www.bruxelles.be/artdet.cfm/5277)

&gt; *L’association -à Bruxelles association se dit ""socheté""- des Noirauds est créée en 1876 pour sauver une crèche de Bruxelles au bord de la faillite. A cette époque, l'exploration et la découverte des pays d'Afrique parlent à l’imagination des gens et le déguisement en ""notable africain"" est idéal pour assurer l'anonymat des collecteurs, souvent de bons bourgeois et clients réguliers des restaurants où ils font la quête...*

&gt; The association of the Noirauds was founded in 1876 to rescue a nursery/kindergarten (crêche) in Brussels that was close to bankrupcy. During those times, the exploration and discovery of the African countries spoke to the imagination of the people and the disguise of a ""noble African"" was ideal to assure the anonimity of the collectors, often well-to-do citizens and clients of the restaurants they visited on route of the quest.

So it has a racial origin, but without negative connotations and is part of local culture. I find it a bit racist myself for people not belonging to our culture to judge it that quickly without knowing its origins or looking beyond the color of the paint. Especially because it was never malign in intent, not even in the past. I'm a bit sick of people calling us racist for no other reason than to expose their own racial prejudices by judging us this quickly.

Umm... well if thats the case.. then we should ban Communism in Germany because of the mass rape of Berlin and the other horrors that the Communists did to the Germans.

Just because of what happened in the past doesnt dictate how the future shall remain. Just because the Russian people in the past were Communist doesnt mean that they must not be Fascist in the future.

Vice versa for the Germans. Just because the Germans were National Socialists in the past doesnt mean the Germans cant be Communists in the future.

I hate people that do this.

Your choice. I am not sure if I've seen an economist not acknowledging the significant structural Eurozone flaws but hey, maybe you know better.

Spain was probably the most fiscally responsible country in Europe. Well.. that worked out well for them.

&gt; So, you actually believe that cutting spending to avoid worsening a debt problem and avoid going bankrupt, particularly in a time where no one is willing to lend you money, doesn't make sense.

Do you even have any idea what you are talking about or you are just spewing nonsense? Especially when on recession, you *cannot* reduce spending, especially so drastically as in Europe periphery. Why? It's basic economics... google, open a book, do something because my head hurts with the stupidity disguised as knowledge. It just starts a recessionary spiral with no end. Oh and we saw the results. But maybe you didn't. Economies destroyed as if there was a war and debt ratio actually *increasing* more and more while for some weird reason that does not make sense the opposite was the goal. Noone is willing to lend you money? What are you talking about? Eurozone has lent Greece 300 billion of the *European taxpayer money* just to save their own banks. If they really wanted to get out of the crisis, they could have done so with much *much* less money and sensible solutions and reforms. They decided not to. They decided it was better to implement their neoliberal agenda with ""flexible"" wages, privatization, free market and ...impoverishment of the people. As, even the creator of the euro, Robert Mundell (who was Nobel awarded for research on optimal currency!) has stated, his point was never to make a strongly designed currency. Due to his neoliberal convictions, his point was to make a flawed currency that would lead to exactly this situation of deterioration so there is alibi for the ""structural reforms"" of the free market. 

I am sure by now that you do not even read but hell one can hope right? [These are the structural reforms and their results.](http://www.globalissues.org/article/3/structural-adjustment-a-major-cause-of-poverty) They are being implemented for the last 30 years. Greece certainly needs reforms and anti-corruption measures but saying that these specific ""structural adjustments""  implemented are the same is simply not true. A testament to Europe's convictions for anti-corruption policies is that they unequivocally were supporting the previous governments which were responsible the last 40 years for the corrupt regime and ...even urged Greece to vote for them in the recent elections! When a new, theoretically not corrupt yet, government emerges they start becoming ...sceptical!

&gt; I am not sure if there is even one historical example where austerity was successful. 

Do you answer to questions?



&gt; On top of that, the enlightened European leaders wanted the destroyed economy of Greece (...)

&gt; &gt; Oh, now it became clear you're just trolling.

Do you even read full sentences or you prefer reading half of them and cherry pick quotes? When a country's economy is in times of peace but it appears as if there has been a war, I'd say it's pretty accurate that the economy is destroyed. If you also ...managed to read the latter half of the sentence you could see that Europe wanted sustained surpluses that basically no country has ever made. Is that also a good plan and part of the ""structural reforms"" of our enlightened European leaders? 

I mean come on. I've argued with people with opposite opinions that have sensible arguments and is actually a pleasure to have dialogue with because I actually learn things.

null,false,Tortulho,null,null,null,"&gt; We are talking about ""skilled workers"", whose skills are wanted by the western economies.

If they are unemployed in their country of origin, obviously their skills are not in demand.

&gt; Having skills and educations gives you a job in any country. 

Patently, that's not true.  Otherwise, they wouldn't be unemployed to begin with.

Some countries actually have shortages and surpluses of technical skills.  In Portugal, for example, the unemployment rate of recently-graduated nurses reaches 50% a couple of years ago.  Meanwhile, in the UK, hospitals even hire people right out of highschool to provide nursing services.

&gt; But Western economies expand and take the labour of skilled workers, who were educated at the expense of (politicaly and financially) troubled nations. 

If the troubles affecting those nations are economical, which reflects on a high unemployment rate, keeping unemployed workers doesn't help them at all.

&gt; his worsens the political and financial situation not only in those troubled countries, but also in their troubled companies. 

Actually, quite the opposite.

If these workers are unemployed, they aren't associated with any job.

If these workers find a job, they can actually be productive and sharpen their skills without being subjected to any form of subemployment.

If these workers emigrate, they generate [remittances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remittance), thus contributing to mitigate their country's problems.

And, obviously, if their skills are in demand somewhere in the world then they also help the nation that welcomes them.

&gt; The West is not only destroying troubled companies in troubled nations by these actions

Bullshit.

And let me remind you that no company owns a laborer.

null,false,waveswan,SWED,Sweden,null,"Scandinavia has a lot of good sites for hydroelectric power that can be used to balance out fluctuations in demand, which is why we can do without the gas. Norway gets almost all its power from hydro for instance. It is in principle possible to build nuclear reactors with highly variable output, France does this to some extent, but it is much more expensive than to run the reactors at constant maximum output.

This is probably one of the greater challenges with electricity and energy generation. Producing enough clean electricity is not too difficult. Just build a bunch of nuclear power plants and wind farms. The issue is that you also need a proportion of generation that can swiftly alter its output to stabilize the grid. In principle you can achieve this by building energy storage facilities, or having a large excess capacity and running your generation at less than optimal output, but that gets very expensive. 

Natural gas and hydroelectric plants are used for this purpose because their output is limited by the amount of fuel / water, and thus the economics does not change much if you save the energy for latter. For renewables and nuclear the situation is the opposite, with most of the cost being due to the construction of the power plant, and thus the price per kWh generated rises rapidly if you run the plant at less than optimal output.

There are a number of efforts to try to alleviate these problems. Some types of industries and electronic equipment can be programmed to run when demand is low to help smooth out the issues. Larger and more integrated power grids can also help average the fluctuations over larger areas (among other things this helps reduce the probability that wind-speed falls across all turbines simultaneously). However, even with these efforts it is very likely that some technological advancements will be necessary to reduce the need for natural gas. Plausible candidates are advanced nuclear reactors, gas produced from renewable sources, like gas from sewage, decomposition of garbage or advanced biofuels, and advanced solar-thermal, which stores solar energy in the form of heated molten salts.

On the demand-scheduling side of things it seems possible to run certain types of heavy industry during the night. Charging of electric vehicles is expected to peak during night-time, and various types of heat-storage could allow the energy needed to keep buildings warm to be supplied during off-peak hours. 

The challenge is to implement such solutions in a manner that is cost-effective and practical. You often see people propose their preferred technology (usually nuclear, renewables or energy conservation) as a solution to these problems, but in reality we will likely need to use a combination of these technologies if we hope to be successful.

**Provincial and Watership elections** New provincial and watership councils were elected last Wednesday. 

The provincial councils are nationally important as they in turn elect the members of the Senate in May. The ruling liberals - of PM Mark Rutte's People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) - lost some seats but are set to remain the largest party in the Senate. The biggest loser this election was the junior coalition partner, the Labour Party (PvdA), which loses nearly half of its seats. Both parties only have a majority in the upper house of parliament, but not in the Senate. The poor results diminish the governing coalition even further in the Senate.

Three constructive opposition parties - the christian conservatives of the Christian Union (CU) and the Political Reformed Party (SGP) as well as the centrist liberals of Democrats 66 - so far helped out in the Senate in exchange for influence on government propositions. It seems a fourth partner will now be needed despite the strong showing of these three (D66 in particular made massive gains).

Another winner, the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) is a likely candidate to help the government out on the right. Green Left (GL) lost a Senator, but is still large enough to help out from the left side.

Another winner is the leftist, anti-austerity Socialist Party (SP), which takes over from Labour as the largest left-wing party. The northern province of Groningen, which is traditionally Labour territory, is now held by the SP. The SP won over many left-leaning voters due to its tough campaign to reduce gas drilling in favour of renewable energy. Groningen, traditionally rich on natural gas, suffers earthquakes and damaged houses because the gas reserves are dwindling, making the land sink.

Dissapointment was there for the far-right Freedom Party, which was polling very strongly for months, but lost one seat in the Senate. This mirrors the parliamentary elections in 2012 and the European elections last year, both of which turned out to be a dissapointment for the right-wing populists. The anti-islam party was expected to capitalise on the recent attacks in France and Denmark, but ulitmately failed to do so. It won an important victory in Rotterdam, though.

Issue-specific parties 50Plus, a party for senior citizens, and the Party for the Animals (PvdD) both won seats. The Indepent Senate Group (OSF), which represents provincial parties like the Party for Zealand and the Frisian National Party, keeps its sole senator.

The watership councils were elected on the same day. The waterships take care of the dikes, waterworks, dams etc. that keep our country from flooding, such as the Delta Works. The waterships are often seen as a superfluous layer of government, whose responsibilities should be taken over by provincial governments, but so far they remain a separate body often ignored by voters. To boost democratic participation, the elections were held together with the provincial elections with two different ballots for both. Previous watership elections were held not in polling stations but via mail. These were the first ones held in a polling station, just like the provincial, parliamentary, European and municipal elections. The party Natural Water (Water Natuurlijk) won the most seats nationwide if all watership councils are combined.

**New minister and state secretary for Justice &amp; Safety** Ard van der Steur and Klaas Dijkhoff (both VVD MP's) are replacing Ivo Opstelten and Fred Teeven as minister and state secretary respectively on the Justice and Safety Ministry. Opstelten and Teeven had to resign last week after not informing parliament correctly. A deal had been struck by Teeven with a convicted drug criminal in 2001. The amount of money involved, it turns out, is much higher than Opstelten had initially claimed. Nothing illegal has been done, so Teeven will - controversially - now become an MP. The seat had been open because VVD MP Mark Verhijen stepped down after corruption allegations. Even more controversial is Johan Houwers, a VVD politician convicted of fraud. The party doesn't accept Houwers as one of their own, but Houwers can take his seat due to the party list-based system that is used to elect MP's in the Dutch parliament. The VVD recently struggles with many scandals like the ones mentioned here, but the losses at the provincial elections were still quite modest, keeping the party's position as the country's largest intact.",null,0,null,1427026895,null,0,1427137914,0,cpmv8gq,null,t3_2zvmyc,null,t1_cpmv8gq,null,t3_2zvmyc,null,null,null,1431946335,null,15,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,15,null

&gt; All truly wise thoughts have been thoughts already thousands of times; but to make them truly ours, we must think them over again honestly, till they take root in our personal experience.

-- Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

Klar heißt das im Umkehrschluß auch, dass man alles noch wichtige und relevante *auch* modern ausdrücken kann. Aber dennoch, Technologie und Tagesprobleme wechseln, aber ein paar Schichten darunter ist der Fortschritt eher gletscherartig, und auch Rückschritt ist möglich. Das ist nicht wie eine Uhr, die keine Wahl hat, als sich ""vorwärts"" zu bewegen -- sprich, nur weil es chronologisch danach kommt, mag es zwar gerade ""modern"" sein (was übrigens entweder von Mode kommt, oder von einem Umbruch mit Traditionen in allen Lebensbereichen -- das trifft allerdings auch auf Mao oder Hitler zu), aber es ist nicht automatisch besser.

Lies mal Erich Fromm, und erzähl mir dann, dass wir heute ""weiter"" sind. Wir sind heute schon so ""weit"", dass wir gar nicht mehr kapieren, wovor der und andere gewarnt haben. Man nehme nur Nietzsches ""Gott ist tot"", das heute um 180° verdreht und triumphierend nachgeplappert wird. Klar hat keiner von denen oder von uns die Weisheit mit Löffeln gefressen, aber ""Fortschritt"" bedeutet aber auch ein Aufbauen auf dem vorherigen, ein Voranschreiten ausgehend von alten Vorstellungen, ein Widerlegen dieser -- dazu muss die Sprache nicht genauso verschwurbelt sein, aber das Denken doch mindestens so tief. Sonst ist es eben doch kein Fortschritt, sondern nur ein Abreissen und ein Absinken, ein rumprahlen gegenüber etwas, das man gar nicht kennt. Wir saugen zehntausende Jahre von ""Fortschritt"" (und auch Missbildung) nicht mit der Muttermilch auf, biologisch sind Menschen von heute genauso wie Steinzeitmenschen, der Unterschied ist einzig in der Überlieferung, was wir weitergeben bzw. aufnehmen. Und ich habe oft den Eindruck, wir haben heute viele Dinge schon als ""zu stressig"" aufgegeben, mit denen man vor 100-200 Jahren mit einer ganz anderen Selbstverständlichkeit gerungen hat. Die grossen Fragen sind immer noch Macht und Gerechtigkeit, und wohl Götzendienst und Entfremdung im Fromm'schen Sinne, und dazu gibt es neue Vorkommnisse alter, gründlich beleuchteter Muster.

It's hideous propaganda from specific greek media who started it and aggressively reproduced it. To get you the context, this propaganda war from these mainstream corrupt media exists forever and especially since the elections because they are broke, hugely indebted for years and have been taking huge loans with no guarantees from greek banks (it amounts to almost a billion iirc) with the tolerance and help of the previous governments. They are a major part of the corruption in Greece since they are operated by known families.  Syriza, at least according to their pre-election rhetoric, they want to introduce measures for these media, basically either pay your debts or we will announce a new contest for the tv frequencies. Unfortunately, they still haven't introduced the measures so it's on them that the propaganda continues harsher and harsher.

About the specific case: He was a lawyer and was representing cases of people being fired. They accuse him of making contract to take 12% of their compensations when they get their jobs back. And as a minister he got those jobs back in order to gain profit. But the truth is a bit different...

From the previous summer he stopped working in the lawyer office since he was in the European parliament. Consequently, the contracts are from before the previous summer. On top of that, he was just helping people fired with *no pay* and he would just get payed if he got their jobs back (that's a reason why he was chosen a minister). Also, the contract was saying he will take 12% of the compensation *only* if they get their jobs via winning in court. Not if they just get employed as happened. There were other lies in the article such as he was in the greek parliament when he isn't. Basically he had no personal gain from hiring the people. He left the European parliament which had a 10k wage and went to be a minister with less money. As he put it ""if any of these were true, I would have to either leave the country or suicide"".

The government could easily do the same with just raising the VAT or other taxes a bit but this is a bit more transparent. As a german I am absolutely ok with us having public TV that is not so dependent on the money of companies (and therefor has to represent the opinion of those companies) and private TV to compensate the other influences. Yes the quality is a problem and I would be happier, if our public tv broadcasters would create more shows in the quality the BBC does, which is in britain also a public broadcaster financed through a fee and some of their shows are coproductions with our public tv broadcasters. And there are several other coproductions with other countries, all of them profit therefor somehow from the fee.

Ah and do not forget there are several movies that are produced in the US that get financial support from german media fonds who receive also a bit of money from the fee. Media is an international business your media companies get money from all over the world to finance your movies, we live in a globalised world. If we were nationalistic we would pump all the money in our own media companies and produce the stuff ourself, instead of outsourcing it to the US, just be happy that the whole world is a market place for your media products.

null,false,Quas4r,FRAN,'urop,null,"&gt;observe that public transportation already is subsidized a lot. Usually, tickets only cover 30% or such of the costs, you're in a better position than me to get at the correct numbers for Paris. In particular, construction also has to be factored in, not just operation. Building metros is not cheap.    

All you're saying is ""transport is expensive to build and already subsidised"" how is that an argument for even greater subsidies ? Where is the money going to come from when there are so many other issues to spend it on, like employment, housing ... ?   

&gt;In general, public transportation without subsidies is impossible, as the prices would be too high compared to cars etc. which is one way to get American conditions. Modern cities are impossible without public transportation, and you'd still have to build expensive roads.    

Those are arguments for *building* a public transportation system. Not for making free the one we already have.

&gt;Then, there's secondary effects. From lower pollution (exhausts, noise, you name it), lower stress levels because you can make streets narrower, again, planting way more green, people using bikes, your healthcare system is going to thank you.    

I don't know if transport free would make many drivers give up their vehicles... transport is already cheaper than owning a car today. People who are concerned about costs have already made the choice to use transport.    
And about tourism, come on... nobody is going to make travel decisions based on costs of local transportation. Plus I'm not sure we can have more love from tourists than we already have! For all the hate Paris gets on the internet, it keeps making the top of world tourism rankings. They hate us but they keep coming, they sure showed us :D

The blackface is, and always has been, a direct caricature of the features of Sub-Saharan Africans. They are explicitly dressed as what are imagined to be nobles from Sub-Saharan Africa, and its meant to be funny that they look ridiculous doing it. It is indeed designed as a way for rich Belgians to make a winking gesture at anonymity while they publicly congratulate themselves for their charity, but they are painting themselves black and dressing up in clothes that are conspicuously tacky for the 1870's Europe to laugh at how 'hilarious' the concept of African nobility is. Thats the joke, it is fundamentally racist, and it is especially chilling for how it was created in the context of one of the greatest genocides in human history. 

The Noirauds started in 1876, the same year as the [Brussels Geographical Conference](http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195149227.001.0001/acref-9780195149227-e-0106) hosted by [King Leopold II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_II_of_Belgium) where the [International African Association](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_African_Association) was founded, with royal patronage. Brussels was a city King Leopold II was desperately trying to bend towards supporting his colonial goals, which were then settled on central Africa after failed attempts at buying or stealing a colony just about everywhere else on Earth.  [The colony he founded in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State) went on to murder people by the tens of millions through systems of brutal wealth extraction designed to enrich Leopold personally and the people who first walked the streets of Brussels in blackface. 

Surely the wealthy elite of Brussels could continue to contribute their wealth to childrens' charities, and even continue to conspicuously make a show of doing so, without also displaying their underlying assumptions of white supremacy.  However, until the day comes that it even occurs to us to be embarrassed by this unintentional caricature of just how deeply racist Belgium continues to be, we will continue to have this annual reminder.",null,1,null,1427029591,null,0,false,0,cpmvx4j,null,t3_2zw7lw,null,t1_cpmvx4j,null,t1_cpmudw0,null,null,null,1431946658,null,-6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-6,null

Ich glaube nicht dass sie wirklich inkompetent ist. Sie weiß genau welche Auswirkungen die verschiedenen Drogen haben. Und daher weiß sie auch, dass Cannabis wenig gefährlich, im Grunde schon harmlos ist. Und natürlich weiß sie auch selber wie dumm ihre Argumente sind, mann merkt es wenn mann ihrer Körpersprache beobachtet.  Sie weiß auch, dass Alkohol und Zigaretten um einiges schlimmer sind als Cannabis. Aber, vermutlich wird sie von ihrer Partei gezwungen diese Position einzunehmen und Cannabis zu verteufeln. Aus welchen Gründen auch immer. Vermutlich Lobbyismus von Pharmafirmen und der Zigaretten und Alkohollobby ( Welche übrigens Neben Autofirmen mit den stärksten Einfluss auf die Politik nehmen). 

Persönlich denke ich, dass Cannabis legalisiert werden muss. Ich denke auch, dass das in den nächsten 10 bis 15 Jahren passiert, selbst in den Konservativen Staaten der USA wird ja Cannabis zurzeit legalisiert oder zumindest für den Medizinischen erlaubt. Cannabis zumindest für die Medizin zu erlauben ist der erste Schritt hier in Deutschland, selbst Gerda Hassfeldt ( welche eine der wichtigsten und mächtigsten Politikerinnen der CSU und sogar in ganz Deutschland ist )  scheint das zumindest im Ansatz inzwischen auch zu verstehen. http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/cannabis-fuer-schwerkranke-csu-politikerin-gerda-hasselfeldt-denkt-um-a-1016492.html . Was in diesem Artikel beschrieben wird,  ist zwar nicht viel aber immerhin ein Schritt in die richtige Richtung. Eine Legalisierung von heute auf morgen wird es nicht geben, dass wird sich ziehen.

You can maybe say it's scandalous or that there was a conflict of interest kinda but it's hardly corruption.

I personally don't think it's that big of a deal. Let me demonstrate with a hypothetical example. Let's say there is a environmental activist lawyer who takes up a court case to represent some people protesting an operation that is potentially damaging for the environment in their community. The lawyer then joins a political party and that party adopts a stance against the operation in their political platform. The party gets elected and the lawyer is appointed minister and becomes responsible for legislating against the operation. Is that a conflict of interest? Is it corruption? Or is it just a normal political process?

When he became Swedish royalty, he had also been the Sovereign [Prince of Pontecorvo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Pontecorvo) in Southern Italy from 1806 until 1810  (title established on June 5 1806 by [Napoleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon)), but then stopped using that title.

We're not Netherlands or Sweden where 90% of the population speaks English. Hell, our President doesn't speak any English.

We would certainly be doing better than Bosnia, because all our nations get along well, but the fragmentation would still be similar. Right up to religious divisions - Lithuania is mostly Catholic with few Orthodox, Latvia is mostly Lutheran but Catholicism and Orthodoxy are big, and Estonia is basically non-religious. While Latvians and Lithuanians would be enjoying a lot of common in traditions and culture, Estonia wouldn't feel like a part of the same union culturally.

I just cannot see it happening. What would be great is a united military, but there's no precedent for independent countries to have a single military, and it's probably not possible.

Suddenly boom it's a topic for the UN and American news shows bring it up. 

What should we do then? Not celebrate it? Let saint-Nicholas occasionally be played by black or asian dude same with Pete?

Nice strawman. Btw Does that 100% Americanised culture include the American revering of freedom of speech?

&gt;Nope. It's just you. You are racist.

I mean come on do you really think everyone who finds this a bit stupid to be racist because you're taking a rather big portion of the Belgian/Dutch population then. 

It's a Dutch Belgian tradition revering some saint from more then 1700years ago in a fest with pagan pre-christian elements. Not a single kid knows about the old bad conotations of Spanish Moores and just thinks of it as some black dude helping an old dude bringing sweets to the nice kids. Hell not even many adults know.

Similarly here. It's people rolling with a tradition based on an old forgotten stereotype to raise money for children in poverty. Likely even black children in Africa.

Do you think either of these will ever reinforce bad stereotypes of blacks? Is it really so bad that we should drop it? I don't know if that guy is racist.

I like how, in the summary of where we landed (3 - Average Openness) Poland was one of six countries in that category that they couldn't be bothered to say anything about.

Our Trade Policy score (4.6, also weighted at 35%) brought things back up FDI Openness (3.6, 15%) brought it down a bit and Trade-Enabling Infrastructure (4.2, 15%) brought it back up again.

It's, on its own, not, I just wanted to make clear that getting rid of tickets only involves a fraction of the total cost of the system.

&gt; Where is the money going to come from

Taxes, savings in other areas, mostly.

&gt; Those are arguments for building a public transportation system. Not for making free the one we already have.

It's an argument saying ""public transport is, overall, a better and cheaper idea than individual traffic"". Also in infrastructure costs. It's a slider you can set to certain points. What I argue, also with the secondary effects is that additional push towards more public transport is worth, in every case, at least a study. In many cases it will be a net economical gain after all is taken into account, in other places it might not but you still might want to do it because it's nice. There's also places with e.g. free water fountains. We're not in Sparta, here.

&gt; I don't know if transport free would make many drivers give up their vehicles... transport is already cheaper than owning a car today. 

That has to be assessed on a city-by-city basis. It certainly worked out for many places that tried. 

If in doubt, you can also always rise gas and general car taxes. Making streets smaller also helps, but of course costs additional money. Painting lanes so they're reserved for bikes is rather cheap, though. Also, increase the prioritization of trams and buses, there's e.g. no need they have to stop at traffic lights, which further ensures public transportation to be faster than individual cars. Systems for that are usually already in place for ambulances, anyway.

What? You're reading stuff that isn't even there.

First off, what did he do wrong with the word 'migrant circles'? He said that most complaints came from 'migrant circles', what is incorrect about that? Looks like a standard observation to me. He didn't say only migrants are to blame for this are anything, he only said that most complaints are coming from migrants, which is true.

Then the SJW thing. Why can't someone use it 'innocently'? To me taking political correctness to the exteme is a normal example of a SJW, what is wrong with that?

And then you talk about white people's culture. Where did he name something about a white people culture? This is what he said:

&gt; Is everything racist today, except telling white people their culture is wrong?

I don't see him doing much wrong here. He doesn't word it like he perceives this whole ordeal as some attack on white culture in general.

However, quite why you don't trust polls seems very odd: they remain the best guide to predicting election outcomes and while they are not perfect, they give us very interesting data that it is odd to ignore. We will get a good indication of how good the Figaro/IFOP poll is shortly, when we get the results of the first round of the French local elections. Does the Danish national statistics agency do opinion polls in relation to elections? I don't think the French one does, so it is not helpful in this regard.

&gt; And so they do here, and that's not really relevant to my point. People cared left and right and whatever they felt like here, most of it had no weight whatsoever and we still managed. Too much fuss around politics, always and ever.

That's fine if you are not interested in politics or don't like discussing it.

One problem I might see with topic based learning is the lack of oversight.

In primary school (age 7 - 12) we often did ""projects"": we (the students) could chose a topic (e.g. Anctient Egypt). Then we might do field trip to a museum, all make presentations about different aspects of ancient Egypt, the math lessons might be more Egyptian themed, etc...

In the end you might learn some stuff about Egypt, but if you never get an overview of all of human history it's hard to put stuff in perspective.

On another note: I'm a bit annoyed with the following statement: 

“What we need now is a different kind of education to prepare people for working life.
...
“We therefore have to make the changes in education that are necessary for industry and modern society.”

For me the main purpose of education should not be preparation for the working life or industry. The 'modern society' part is way more important for me.

Furthermore, Lend-Lease only started becoming significant around late 1942, well after the crucial first six months and Battle of Moscow (although there were a few British tanks there, iirc). After the Germans lost at Moscow, there was basically no hope for a quick victory - in other words, the USSR would absolutely put up a good fight.

Finally, Germany had allies too: Romania, Hungary, Italy, Slovakia and Finland all participated in Operation Barbarossa, although they varied in usefulness (Finland, at least, was very competent, and Romania's oilfields were essential to the German war effort). In a 1v1 fight, the two countries were actually fairly evenly matched, although the USSR still ultimately had the edge thanks to its enormous size and population.

So no wonder that someone writing a new ""tradition"" (or Christmas Story, or whatever it was ment to be in the first place) around that time would have looked at other stories and try to keep in line with the general story line, but give a modern twist to it (so black slaves and a saint). 

But there is no way of exactly knowing what the motivations were of course. 

So I personally disagree with the idea that rainbow-colored or clown zwarte pieten would be a good substitute. I feel that if we want to change this tradition, it would make sense to look at the important parts and try to keep those. And I feel that an important part is the black colour.

Altersarmut stimmt auch, das was wir als arm bezeichnen ist allerdings wieder global gesehen ein schlechter Witz.

Grundsätzlich würde ich sagen, dass in Informatik der Abschluss relativ egal ist. Das nimmt zwar auch immer weiter ab, aber viele Leute die in meiner Firma hohe Positionen besetzen haben teilweise komplett andere Ausbildungen gemacht, also nichtmal ein abgeschlossenes Studium.

Solange die was können interessiert das niemanden.

Zumal es ja so ist, dass sich Dinge relativ schnell ändern in dieser Welt. Daher ist es viel wichtiger was man aktuell kann, als welchen Abschluss man irgendwann mal gemacht hat. 

Wichtiger als alles andere finde ich, dass du ins Team passt wo auch immer du dich bewirbst. Klar gehst du mit der Einstellung ran gerne einen Job haben zu wollen, irgendeinen eventuell. Aber langfristig musst du dich mit den Leuten gut verstehen.

Ob das passt, kannst du selbst sehr schwer einschätzen, hier hat dein Arbeitgeber/Chef IMHO die Verwantwortung jemanden zu finden der sich gut in die bestehenden Verhältnisse integrieren kann, und dann kann das auch richtig Spaß machen. Das heißt im Umkehrschluss aber auch, dass du auf Stellen wo du laut Papier saugut drauf passt evtl. nicht genommen wirst. Das muss man nicht persönlich nehmen.

Desweiteren ist es wichtig, dass Leute 'Bock' haben. Wir haben schon welche eingestellt die zugegeben haben dass sie nix können, aber die konnten gut erklären warum sie das machen wollen, und die haben in kurzer Zeit sehr große Fortschritte gemacht.

Das ist mir 10x lieber wie einer der mit den richtigen Buzzwords ankommt, alles schon kann, aber keine Eigeninitiative zeigt und nur macht was er muss.

1. It is very far from racist. Being told that a cultural norm is harmful or insensitive is very, very different from the institutionalised victimization of a group, based on that groups (perceived) biological characteristics.

2. It is definately a racist tradition. u/BBlasdel made an [excellent point](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2zw7lw/belgiums_blackface_minister_of_foreign_affairs/cpmvx4j) below, but even if I were to grant you that there is no malign intent, the connotations of white people wearing black face is the otherness of black people. Like a dwarf or bearded lady at a freakshow, they are not considered as people but are reduced to being a spectacle.

3. Norms and traditions are not ends, but means to an end. When norms are recognised as being more harmful than good, it is imperative on anyone making that observation to mention it, so it can be ended as soon as possible.

4. All of Europe is going through the process of outgrowing it's racist cultural expressions, so while a Swede may not know the Belgian tradition of black face, she is very familiar with the problematic use of the word 'negro' in Pippi Longstocking. You would both be right to criticise such cultural artifacts in each others culture, and both would be very familiar with the struggles of changing them in the face of reactionary uproar.

null,false,mkvgtired,null,null,null,"&gt; Are the US states bloody competitors from each others at all costs ?

To a certain extent yes. States compete with tax rates and other incentives. Some states require union membership for certain professions, and other do not. The US manufacturing base is mostly in non-mandatory union states (unions are still legal, but membership is voluntary). 

States very much compete on tax rates. Some states have a relatively high state tax burden, some have no income tax, others have an income tax but no sales tax. 

&gt;We either all get rich or all fail.

This is where I would say the main difference lies. In the US there is a very strong federal wealth transfer mechanism. Richer states lose between 30-50% of their largest tax obligation in terms of federal spending in their state. Poor states have much more spent there than they pay. 

So the short answer would be there is quite a bit of competition, but there is a federal structure in the end that supports at least the bare minimum standards and transfers wealth from rich to poor.

I have said this in a different comment already, so I'll just c&amp;p it:

'Censorship because of human rights issues and political affiliation are two completely different ballparks.' To even call the former ""censorship"" I find absolutely outrageous.

Take this as an example:

""I do not approve of Zionism. Israel is an apartheid state. Israel has commited war crimes."" -You're most probably an asshole, but it is your right to say this.

""Jews are evil. Jews are supressing Arabs because they are inherently bad people. The Holocaust is propaganda so we feel sorry for the Jews and ignore their crimes."" -You *are* an asshole and you should have no right to say this. You are not offering a political POV, you're just spouting racist bullshit.

So to get back to your original question, if the ""humongous Nazi propaganda empire"" sends the message that autarky, isolationism and nationalism is the way to go, I believe it is their right to do so. If they propagate racism and antisemitism, then no. Easy as that.

&gt;you fucking Nazi shithead?

&gt;**Snus**  
Snus is a moist powder tobacco, a kind of snuff. Snus is manufactured and mainly consumed in Sweden, where it is pronounced . The most usual way to consume snus is to place it beneath the upper lip, and keep it there for a time varying from a few minutes to several hours, according to taste. There are two main types of snus on the market:
original snus or lössnus is a loose, moist powder which can be portioned and rolled into a cylindrical shape with the fingertips, or using a prismaster tool. The end result is often referred to as a pris (pinch) or prilla (slang for pris).
portionssnus, is prepackaged powder in small bags made from the same material as teabags. It comes in smaller quantities than the loose powder but is considered easier to handle.

&gt;**Surströmming**  
Surströmming (sour herring) is a Swedish delicacy consisting of fermented Baltic herring. Surströmming is sold in cans, and when opened they release a strong, foul smell. It is for this particular smell, which is similar to fish gone bad or garbage left out in the sun for a couple of days, that surströmming is infamous in popular culture, and it is often held that people who try surstömming can be confident that they will never forget it. Because of the smell, the dish is often eaten outdoors.

They have no way of checking the non-EU documentation is legit (and it will have come from official sources), and then on the back of that you can get an officially issued passport that gives you access to the EU.   

People are picking them up for a few grand a piece:

&gt;By working with a man posing as a citizenship hopeful, “Vladimir”, we show that the procedure for acquiring a Romanian passport cannot distinguish genuine applicants from those whose grandparents are plucked from Soviet history and literature.

&gt;After acquiring birth and marriage certificates for Vladimir’s ‘grandparents’ we used the same intermediary to get hold of police records from the Moldovan and Romanian authorities, confirming that Vladimir did not have any criminal convictions.

&gt;Along with the certificates from the Moldovan archive, these documents were presented at the citizenship bureau in Bucharest, where an official confirmed that they appeared genuine.

&gt;According to the official, Vladimir could apply to take the oath of citizenship once he had completed a few more formalities – namely, submitting his identity card, an application form, and a statement from a notary.

&gt;The official’s confidence was not misplaced. Vladimir’s documents have the seals and signatures of all the appropriate institutions and officials in Moldova and Romania. **But while the papers may be legitimate, the means with which they were procured were not**....

&gt;For €700, all the essential citizenship documents could be arranged within 15 months. Payment of €1,000 guaranteed the documents within 10 months, while a fast-track application – completed within five months – cost €1,500. Once citizenship had been acquired, further payment of €95 and a 10-day wait would secure the applicant a Romanian passport. A Romanian ID card would cost an extra €140.

The debt problems of Detroit happened because for decades, Detroit had borrowed more money than it had a hope of paying back.  This was exacerbated by Detroit's economy shrinking: a debt taken out by a city that not only doesn't grow but rapidly shrinks becomes more-difficult to pay off.  Detroit's need to service debt resulted in ever-more-pressure on taxes and surcharges.

The shrinkage of Detroit's economy happened because automation increased and places other than Detroit became more-competitive, which reduced demand for Detroit's labor.

To OP: Duolingo is definitely great, especially for beginning listening comprehension. Before I could move on to documentaries or TV shows for listening comprehension (I did know enough words nor did I have very much listening comprehension ability to start with), I used duolingo to get me up to speed. I cannot attest to the effectiveness of Duolingo for building vocabulary, so if you aren't able to remember words very well via Duolingo, then I recommend going on memrise.com and using the German Duolingo course (there is a course that contains all of the vocabulary in the German Duolingo tree). In general, I would recommend memrise.com for expanding your vocabulary once you have some basic vocabulary and grammar knowledge from Duolingo. I cannot recommend the memrise course ""5000 Words (top 87%) sorted by frequency"" enough. At first, I would recommend ignoring grammatical words (like prepositions, particles, etc) because you will learn them better through Duolingo, especially because the memrise course does not give an example sentence so you wouldn't know how to use the word anyway. Anyway, the top 5000 words course (don't do the whole thing; just do enough until you are comfortable. Learning a language is a years-long commitment, so don't fret if you don't enjoy the language after a while. After a certain point, learning gets more fun because you can finally interact) is great for learning the extremely common words that Duolingo might skip over because they don't fit into a specific theme.

Here we go:

We all have prejudices. That is how humans work. We need to put people in categories. And strangers are potentially dangerous. We put labels on people. We group people. And we are afraid. Modern media consumption seems to heighten those fears. Prejudices against certain groups of people are most common where those don't live. The less interactions you have with black people, the more prejudices you can have. The more you interact with, the more you see them go. You deal with individuals. Not with a group. Race isn't by far the only category. Just the most obvious. There is culture (Roma move around a lot), religion (Jews, Muslims), sex (women), sexual preference (homosexuals), disabled people...

These prejudices, that everyone has (inlcuding all races, sexes and whatnot), are just thoughts. Nothing more, nothing less. There are no thoughtcrimes. Though as soon as you propagate your prejudices in public forums or private conversations, they spread to other people. Just like any other idea. And as soon as people act upon them, it becomes a lot more complicated. And problematic. Especially when people in a position of power do so. A black slave in the US can hate all white people as long as he likes. He will never be in a position where his hate will have a negative effect on a white individual. The landlord that is afraid of gays and won't rent out to people he things are gay does make a difference. Even to people that are not gay, but that he thinks that are. A judge that is racist will have a devastating effect on many lives of people of color that come across him and their families. The individual, the target, has nothing to do with the racism. It doesn't matter. They might never know (for example the guy that didn't get the appartment). 

Racism is a complex concept. Because it incorporates both the prejudice, possible actions taken by people for prejudice reasons and the effects these actions have on individuals. 

Because it makes such a huge difference who has prejudices and what their position in society is, the word ""racism"" is usually only used when minorities are effected as the victims. Because majority people will probabely never feel the effect. And minorities usually can't afford being racist anyways. Imagine someone having a store who is part of a minority. If he doesn't want customers from the majority, how long will the store survive? ""We don't serve white people"" simply doesn't work. But against a minority it doesn't really hurt the business. ""We don't serve gays"" will not effect a business in a meaningful way. Except if people take issue with that. ""We don't serve Muslims"" will probabely work pretty good today in modern, Islamophobic Europe. 

These days you interact with a lot of people that have some small way to influence your outcome. You apply for jobs, try to sell to customers, try and rent a room, interact with public administration, ... When prejudices are spread and some people dislike minorities, it will effect them a lot, because they will be disadvantaged in some of these interactions. That adds up at the end of the day. Even if someone isn't a huge racist that goes out every night and beats up black people, if a public official has some prejudice against minorities, it will effect their actions. This is, for example, evident in the number of CEO ratio male/female we have. Even though women aren't a minoritiy. When a lot of people compete for something, small stuff matters. And it adds up.

This is what we call institutionalized racism. And it is common in Europe and the US. Blacks, for example, get more prison time for the same crimes in the US. In Germany blacks always get checked for drugs by police. Which will also influence statistics, btw. If the same percentage of whites and blacks carry drugs with them, but a higher percentage of blacks get searched by police, they will end up with a higher percentage in the police statstics. Adding to the existing racism (*see: those blacks take more drugs, are more likely to be criminals*).

You are suggesting in this comment:

*Is the whole world going SJW or am I missing something? Is everything racist today, except telling white people their culture is wrong?*

You are suggesting that whites are in danger of being at a disadvantage. Nothing could be further from the truth. One core reason for racism is fear. Fear of the foreigner. Fear that they might get a bigger piece of the pie. You seem afraid that they might take something away from you.
About SJW:

Most of the posts that are ridiculed on /r/tumblrinaction actually have some merit, but are brought across in a horrible way. While there is no oppression as such, there is a lot of sexism. Calling it ""rape"" is completely over the top. But by drawing focus to these crazy posts, /r/tumblrinaction clearly shows disdain for the issues itself. If I want to diminsh certain issues, I just show crazy people pushing for them. Which is basically what /r/tumblrinaction is about. They have an agenda.

OK, you're not helping yourself here. 

So, SNCF stands for Société nationale des chemins de fer (rail-roads) français. It's a public company, meaning it's owned by France. We're kinda proud of the TGV also. 

Most of us had bad experiences with SNCF, I even had a SNCF employee complaining about another SNCF employee.

I was in a hurry in a TGV without my ticket once, so I  went to meet the controller (not sure of the translation). Turn out you can buy a ticket in the train, but it costs you extra. If you wait for the controller, you have a fine. There is no need to argue, the employee is just doing his job. 

Nobody will be fired in France because a consumer is complaining (or it's like your only client). SNCF employees are not public servants, but it's near, and you don't fire public servants unless they killed somebody or something like that.

* Häufig wird erwähnt, dass sich das Verbot nicht präventiv auswirkt. Es ist aber zu erwarten, dass sich bei legaler Verfügbarkeit und legalem Konsum die Nutzung von Cannabis verändern wird. Diese Änderung mag nicht sofort stattfinden. Aber mit der Zeit kann sich Cannabis auch als Kulturgut durchsetzten(in manchen Kreisen mag es dies bereits sein) und somit den Konsum normaler, akzeptabler machen.

* Es hat Jahre gedauert bis sich in der breiten Öffentlichkeit durchgesetzt hat, dass Tabak extrem schädlich ist. Muss der Staat nicht dafür sorgen, dass über Cannabis und andere Drogen dementsprechend aufgeklärt wird? Wäre eine Aufhebung des Verbots nicht diesem Interesse gegenläufig.

Now you are twisting facts. The US economy rely on borrowing and growth to pay it back &amp; more. Except, you can't have any more growth when 90% of the country's wealth is owed by like 5000 men who don't give a single penny back in the system and just use it to gather the remaining 10% out of everyone. Then suddenly they don't understand why people stop paying for utilities or oil or the local corrupt gov's debts (spoilers: there isn't enough money left cycling in the economy, because they stashed it ALL under their pocket. People can't pay for stuff when they never had any income to begin with) and everything crashes brutally.

&gt; Detroit's need to service debt resulted in ever-more-pressure on taxes and surcharges.

No, Detroy need to jail the assholes who privatized the utilities, who stole the local population out of their living then ran away to live in a better place after having sucked the blood out of that country part. And bring back the money where it belong (not bermuda and fuckin GOP senators bribe pockets). And use the money stolen by the local oligarchs to erase said debts. Because it's the corporatists, not the local citizens who made those debts in the first place. Right now it's the industrialists from Detroit saying ""i make debts and you pay for it. Oh why won't you pay for it ? BANKRUPTCY §§§ We weren't competitive enough !""

&gt; and places other than Detroit became more-competitive

Yeah that's bullshit. ""We can't pay our slaves because otherwise we wouldn't be competitive"". No, sorry; it not a valid excuse. If you can't afford to pay employees, you can't afford to run a company to begin with, and have no divine right to any ""profit"" money stolen out of their wages to make the numbers add up.

Another example of regulatory enshrinement is the EC card by the Zentraler Kreditausschuss. This is essentially an industry market cartel that aims to block international finance from gaining a foothold in Germany. German banks protecting their interests at the expense of a wider credit / debit market. At a larger scale level is keeps German savings in Germany in every way that it can.

I knew that some of this doesn't compare to some of the shit the City of London gets up to with corporate tax breaks and overseas holdings but it's still less than ideal, regardless of where your political sensibilities lie. 

As for business what you say I believe to be generally true. Capital sources are dry for unknown entities compared to the US and the UK. If you're a cookie cutter company in a popular industry you'll be ok but emergent markets are somewhat restrained by an ethos of fiscal conservatism. 

I'll try and sum up the rest of the points in one because it's all related. First my point is about self-employment. In other countries self-employment is very simple, you effectively turn yourself into a company, you have the same tax free earnings as an individual and then pay tax on top of that as normal. However in Germany you are a freelance worker than frankly that really sucks, you pay your entire healthcare costs, costs which are designed to make you pay for your future nursing care needs (which is absurd if you're only in the country for a few years), in many professions you're required to pay the state pension which is 21% of your profits. All additional to the regular tax which starts the moment you are earning over 900 euros a month which is pittance frankly. 

The system is not adapted well for foreigners, especially those who don't intend to live their entire lives in Germany. It creates a culture of employment, which may sound good but it actually favours big business by creating barriers to competition. It also discourages the immigration of young and technically skilled workers that Germany needs. The reason Germany needs programmers and developers so badly is because these are new professions, it's not like many people take apprenticeships in these industries and they're not regulated like older professions, so it poses a threat to the entire ethos of German thinking which is ""security, security, security"".

Anyway that's my 2 pence, Germany is obviously a lovely wealthy developed nation and nobody should feel discouraged from spending time here because of these things. It's very possible to cut a decent living here and relatively easy to attain a decent quality of life. However it's not an economic environment without faults and it will no doubt face numerous challenges over the next 20 years with adapting to an ever more rapidly changing economic climate possibly aggravated by the value it puts safety, and of course an ageing population putting a burden to the system.",null,0,null,1427041504,null,0,false,0,cpn0xk9,null,t3_2zu3mr,null,t1_cpn0xk9,null,t1_cpmztah,null,null,null,1431949091,null,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5,null

No they handed it to corporations : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_privatization_in_the_United_States#Detroit

Due to them bribing to death the local officials to have them in their pockets, it is de facto a corporation hiding under a state shell company, that allow the corporations to dump any debts on the state (ie tax payers) but pocket 100% of the benefices.

&gt; the city water department did finally start cutting water to people who hadn't been paying their bill.

Let me be blunt : Had the detroit water corporation had their way, 60% of the city would have lost access to running water. And power would have been the next identical scam. Then they move to another town.

Well, that's not entirely correct. People were shapen by the time they were living in, and the inferiority of certain races in this time was considered an absolute truth. There were multiple 'sciences' commited to proof this truth, like the science of eugenics, or the orientalist sciences. In a sense, you can say racism was completely integrated in 19th century European society.

Nonetheless, it is wrong to condemn the people of the 19th century for thinking like this, because if we would have lived in the same period, we would have thought the same thing. 

However, now we know that there is no such thing as 'inferior' and 'superior' races, and that the genetic differences between Somali's and Congolese are likely to be bigger than the difference between Somali's and Arabs or Greeks, we should reconsider our thinking. Because the 19th century pseudesciences huge influence on our society and culture, we are obliged to reject the things the pseudosciences produced, Zwarte Piet and the Noirauds are products of these sciences. We know better now, and it's time to integrate our new knowledge in today's society.

**Continuation:**
Considering the following statement;
&gt; people who are offended by something should learn to deal with being offended rather than try to stop what offends them

The thing that offends the people you mention is the insults directed at them because of their skin color, even though skin color is something that is unchangeble. The fact that people feel the need to ridicule someone's skin color is absurd, and they should be corrected.

People with darker skin are growing up in a society where there is a tendency to value lighter skin over dark skin. Perhaps you've heard of [White doll, black doll experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG7U1QsUd1g), which shows how integrated notions of racial inferiority or superiority are in our societies. 

Dark skinned people can't not choose being influenced by the general assumptions in European societies, assumptions that are considered completely normal in today's culture. I believe these assumptions are absolutely terrible: millions of people are growing up with the culturaly given knowledge that they are worth less because the arbitrarily fact that they have dark skin. Everyone is influenced by this thinking, and how wonderfull it would be to reject and acknowledge, as a society, the falsity of racist expressions, and maybe, because of this, just maybe, reach enlightenment.

is it racism-inducing? Well you could argue that seeing blackpainted faces in coloresque costumes trying to collect money for charity could give people racist feeling, but I will argue that the problem lies with those individuals and not the Swarthies.

So does it have any ties whatsoever with racism? Of course it does! Anything involving our old views of people with darker skin tone contains the stain of racism that was so prevalent back then. It was considered as normal as eating meat today. Is that what the Swarthies are about? No. And as the cultural reality changed around them, so did they.

Hitler then had to send in an entire German Blitzkrieg division to take Greece in 30 days of brutal warfare which delayed the invasion of the Soviet Union to Late Summer instead of Early Spring 1941. This caught the Nazi's in the Winter and rest is history.

The difference is that some believe everything from the past must go and other don't see harm in certain folkloristic relics. It's not more racist to me than allowing the Bible or Quran to be distributed as they arose from even more racist times and clearly write that out in their books.

We can reject something, without rejecting 100% of something. I think that's part of Belgian pragmatism as well.

It's all about context too: in this picture Reynders harbors no ill will, so I find it ridiculous to attack him for it. When my grandmother, who still does have that colonial, paternalistic world view of the white savior and poor helpless blacks, went to Ruanda for charity and came back with pictures of the ""cute little negroes"" (""*lieve kleine negertjes*""). I also roll my eyes at the way she expresses it, but in no way would I think she harbors ill will with that sentiment and put into a context of an able catholic older lady trying to do good for the less fortunate and nothing more.

Can't we just move past it and say: yes, every sane Belgian rejects our colonial past and it's a part of our history that both shames us and we'd never like to see repeated again, but without rejecting everything that came forth from that moment in time? Because by the other logic, there are so many things we in the west must forego first before we supposedly came to term with our past: We shouldn't call people who destroy stuff vandals because it's offensive to the historic struggle of old Germanic Vandal peoples from a Roman point of view. We shouldn't call the West North-African ethnicity Berber either anymore because that also stems from Roman racism etymologically (the Barbarians). I urge all Slavic langauge to rename Germany to something that does not say ""mute people""... where do you stop?

You have a border of about 230 km with Russia. That means 14 350 people per kilometre. 

Our border is 1340 km. That's 4100 people per kilometre. Assuming our population follows the same age pyramid (and it doesn't yours is younger -- ours includes A HUGE AMOUNT OF GERIATRICS) that means that to defend the whole border one Finn has to handle as many Russians as as four Lithuanians.

Not to mention that getting supplies from the rest of Europe is that much easier due to location.

&gt;Your GDP is also much larger than in any of the Baltics

I did mention this.


&gt;As for population density - not sure, if this matters as it isn't spread evenly all over anyway, maybe it would matter, if you wanted to defend only the largest urban centres or something, but everyone has some sparsely inhabited border regions.

Population tells how many people you can have to support war effort and how many places you need to allocate them. If you have 100 people and 20 places each needing 10 people to protect, you either abandon half the places needing defence or hope that you can protect them with only half the man-power. Meanwhile Lithuania has 70 people and 4 places to protect (I think -- I didn't do the math here).

The ""sparsely inhabited border region"" in case of Finland means ""the area north and east from Tampere and Helsinki"". Which I think consists of something like 90% of the total land-area. I live in Jyväskylä and without exaggerating, you can go about 50 to 100 kilometres to any direction and only see forest. And this area is called ""Central Finland"". Things get a lot more sparse if you go North (about 1000 km of Finland in that direction) or East (about 200+ km of Finland before reaching the border).

Valid concern. My mom (Canadian), started out just learning Swiss German and could speak it fluently without any serious errors.

Learning Swiss German is pretty hard outside Switzerland, and in Austria or Germany they might not understand you speaking it at all.

Your best bet is just go for High German. If you're having a tough time with Swiss German, Swiss people will generally switch to High German automatically, so you won't be exposed to much of it anyway.

    Ten ma jasne włoski, mój syn był brunetem!
    Złorzeczy żołnierzom. Sceny ludzkiej męki
    Z ich dynamiką dziką lepiej kręcić z ręki.
    
    W Europejskim Parlamencie
    Sprawca przyznał, że przesadził.
    Z ciepłym spotkał się przyjęciem -
    Słuchać skruchy wszyscy radzi.
    
    Po obu stronach frontu w zasadzie to samo:
    Brak prądu. Rowerowe kręci się dynamo.
    Słuchają kaset z głosem sąsiada i wroga:
    ""Właśnie rżnę ci żonę! O śmierć prosi Boga.

    She curses the soldiers. Scenes of human torment.
    With their ferocious dynamics, it is better to shot from the hand.

    The perpetrator had admitted that he went too far
    He had encountered a warm welcome
    Everybody is happy to hear repentance.

    They're listening without end. Anger gives might.

There's nothing ""fucked up"" there as it by every count is the same parliament that has seat in Brussels and Strasbourg. They are the same deputies because it's the same single institution. France just does not want the official seat of the parliament to be moved from Strasbourg so the parliament is dictated by EU treaties to also be located in Strasbourg.

It is arbitrary what counts as a ""real check on Brussels's decisions"". The lobbyists move where ever there is legislative power, so if the other house of the EU would be located only in Strasbourg, it would also become a major center for lobbying.

It's also worth noting that there's not any singular EU entity in Brussels that makes decisions. The decisions are shared between the Commission, the Parliament and the Council of Ministers, and they have checks on the decisions the others make. If the Commission makes a legislative initiative the Parliament does not like the Parliament will reject it. If the Parliament agrees with the initiative by Commission but the Council of Ministers does not like it, the Council of Ministers will reject it. And if the Council of Ministers approves an initiative, the Parliament does not like, the Parliament will reject it.

An example on this ""real check on Brussels's decisions"" is how the Parliament took a stance to protect net neutrality and to abandon unnecessary costly mobile roaming charges. The Council of Ministers did not like this, and made a ""real check on Brussels's decision"" and rejected the decision by the Parliament and made a new suggestion. The Parliament again made a ""real check on Brussels's decision"" and opposes the decision by the Council of Ministers.

It's also worth noting that the Council of Ministers is made of national ministers, who mostly reside in their home countries managing their national governments, so the lobbying for the Council of Ministers mostly has to be done in each individual country.",null,0,null,1427045024,null,0,false,0,cpn2s7h,null,t3_2ztuay,null,t1_cpn2s7h,null,t1_cpn2atg,null,null,null,1431949963,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

&gt;03/21/2015 | From Spiegel editor in chief Klaus Brinkbäumer

&gt;The new SPIEGEL cover is sharp and striking . But misleading? No, it just can be misunderstood by someone who wants to misunderstand it.

&gt;""Süddeutsche.de"" would obviously like to misunderstand and writes: ""SPIEGEL Merkel is on a par with Nazis.""

&gt;Our cover story explores and explains why the past does not pass, and why in the euro debate and the debate about Germany's leadership role in the Nazi era is back on the topic. The authors have researched in Greece, Italy and the UK, in Brussels and Berlin, why just now quarreled again legally already clarified reparations.

&gt;And the captions say that it is about the European view on Germany. Angela Merkel has been cut and pasted with adhesive So, deliberately clumsy so the cover is reminiscent of the cartoons showing the Chancellor with Hitler mustache. We quote, irony and alienate a look from the outside and the mixing of German history with German and European presence.

This is bullshit. Saudi Arabia is a closed society where people ""disappear"" or are executed on trumped up charges. Sometimes those include some form of apostasy from Islam. There are no ""Atheists"" as such in Saudi Arabia. At least none that would be stupid enough to talk about it. The whole idea of ""Atheism"" is foreign them. You have no idea how other societies work, do you? You should really do some traveling. Maybe not to Saudi Arabia. But Asian countries are very different. For example Japan. It is said that their morals are based on ""shaming"". Which means that what is good or bad isn't in the act, but in what other people think about it. If no one ever notices, it isn't bad. No matter how horrible the act might seem to us. Other societies can be vastly different from ours. Did you ever hear the word ""culture shock""? Why do you think shit like FGM or honor killings even exist? Those people don't think of themselves as evil. 

But let's pretend for a moment that what you say is true:

""Atheists are a very powerless, small minority in Saudi Arabia/Somalia that gets slaughtered like cattle""

Why would that justify mistreating a minority in Europe? Almost all of the Muslims here are not from Saudi Arabia or Somalia. Most Muslims in Germany are from Turkey. A lot in Belgium are from Morocco. Those are completely different places. And even if they all came from Saudi Arabia: What does the mistreatment (or perceived mistreatment) of atheists in another countries even have to do with our discussion?

Sure, but thanks to people attacking Reynders, we are made aware of the origin are of the Noiraud, just like the Dutch have been made aware of the origin of Black Pete. I'm glad people have pointed it out, since this had opened the way for us to discuss our colonial past. 

&gt; Can't we just move past it and say: yes, every sane Belgian rejects our colonial past and it's a part of our history that both shames us and we'd never like to see repeated again

We could say this, of course. However, we are not free from our colonial legacy, which is a legacy that has continued to [this day](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jan/17/patrice-lumumba-50th-anniversary-assassination).

A more sensible thing is to acknowledge our history, and respond to it in a sensible manner. Even though we  aren't personally responsible for the things that happened, we are still dailly effected, and profit, by this history. Something that is probably clearly illustrated in the bloody history of Belgiums royal palace in Brussels. This gives us at least some responsibility for the deeds of our grandfathers, and grandfathers fathers. 

&gt; Why not focus on outward direct expressions of racism today

I don't entirely disagree with you, but in these discussions it's rarely just about a racist stereotype, but about a broader topic as institutional racism in Belgium (and Dutch) society. Black Pete and the Noirauds are symbols of racism in the Netherlands and Belgium, so are easily picked out  to make people aware of racism in our societies. I think that we shouldn't try to just get this discussion over with, but use this oppertunity to tackle integrated racism in general.

If it goes like in other EU countries, they're missing money somewhere else (E.G: unemployment or healthcare money, due to rampant corporate fraud) and using money from other budges to make the numbers add up.

&gt; The current infrastructure is a shambles, and has been ignored for years. There's lead pipes all over the shop. Leakage is horrendous. Boil notices are in place constantly in many places.

You think Ireland is the only one that faced that kind of problems ? In france we had too. Replacing pipes is not that costly and we manage to do it well without feeding oligarchs.

&gt; Place the blame at not just current government, but also at previous governments, 

I blame the complaisance of the govs to fraud that causes them to shuffle constantly more money between every lines to hide how bad *everything* is.

&gt; AND the electorate.

The electorate has about no controle over the gov budget, you and i both know it.

&gt; and welcomed tax cuts, 

In a modern working budget most of the money normally comes from corporate taxation and associated taxes. Not citizens money.

When the gov offer tax cuts to the citizens it's 0.1% missing. When it offers the same to corporations, it's 1% of the gov money that goes missing. 

If you want to see in Ireland's future, look at the US system and what they do. Think big picture, systemic level, something like this is going on in every western gov :

1°) corporations bribe officials in cutting their taxes

2°) the gov give them a cut. Since tons of cash flow goes missing and they can't pay gov bills anymore, the shuffles money from budges to hid it, rise 10% taxes on citizen.

3°) next gov pretend to change and end up that corruption. So the corporations who disagree bribe the GOP senators who use the money to stay in power by buying themselves a personnality cult on TV (fox news and others...); and the gov in exchange give the corpos another tax cut.

4°) 40 years down the line, 30% of the gov budget is missing. Another 20% rise of taxes on citizens won't fix shit but yet still happen. 

5°) then the gov wants to hide how much money is basically stolen (tax evasion by corpos, their fuck up) because that would lead to discover how much shady money they are making from the corporate side (please find a single non millionaire senator.). So they shuffle in more budget, rise taxes on citizens some more, make water a commodity to pay for as of now, and use it to half ass patch the infra.

6°) industrialists try to buy their way in and acquire the utility to squeeze up more money in.

The root of the problem ? Look at 1 and 2. Corporate fraud, bribery. If you want to fix that issue and countless other, crack down on fraud, bribery, and money in politics.

Se è disponibile qualche aggiornamento, aggiorna il firmware del router dal sito del produttore.

Aspetta qualche minuto e vedi (controlla periodicamente anche nei prossimi giorni) se i DNS tornano a cambiare. Se succederà nonostante le nuove credenziali ed il firmware più aggiornato, è possibile che ci siano vulnerabilità intrinseche nel router (a me è successo con due TP-LINK). In questo caso puoi provare a modificare la ACL (lista controllo accessi) del router stesso per permettere modifiche al router soltanto dalla rete locale (dovrebbe esserci una sezione ACL nel pannello di controllo del router).

Procedi cosi:

* Cambia il server DNS è metti 8.8.8.8 (quelli di Google) o qualcosa di cui ti fidi
* Cambia la password al router, e vedi se puoi disabilitare l'accesso remoto da qualche parte
* Pulisci il tuo PC con /r/tronscript (è parecchio lento, fallo di notte)
* Cambia le tue passwords

**Non preoccuparti** comunque, è solo la prassi normale - Non possono ""rubare"" le password in questo modo se un sito è dietro https (e tu non hai mai accettato certificati non validi dal tuo browser).  

---

Se ti interessa, ti spiego al volo come funziona: Il web è composto da tanti numerini magici, che sono chiamati IP. Ogni IP identifica unievocamente un computer collegato ad internet (ok, è un'enorme semplificazione). Gli IP non sono facili da ricordare a memoria, quindi ci siamo inventati un sistema chiamato DNS che permette di assegnare ad un indirizzo IP un nome facile da ricordare. Quando tu scrivi ""reddit.com"" nel tuo browser, il tuo PC contatta un server DNS che gli risponde che IP è associato a quel dominio, e poi il tuo browser continua contattando l'IP che ha appena ottenuto.  

Solitamente di default il tuo PC utilizza dei server DNS che gli vengono forniti dal router. Al router vengono forniti dal tuo provider (tramite magie nere conosciute come DHCP, PPPoE...). In questo caso, qualcuno è riuscito ad accedere al tuo router e cambiare il server DNS, cosi il tuo PC si è connesso al loro.

Questo server DNS quando vede chiamate ad alcuni siti (google-analytics.com per esempio) invece di restituire l'indirizzo IP corretto ne restituisce uno controllato da loro, che ti serve pubblicità con popup e roba del genere per fargli guadagnare qualche millesimo di €€€.",null,0,null,1427046027,null,0,false,0,cpn3bot,null,t3_2zwxap,null,t1_cpn3bot,null,t1_cpn2klr,null,null,null,1431950218,null,7,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,7,null

Yet, it's not enough. Because :

- The 1% should NEVER had accrued that much money, that should be cycling in the economy instead; whether in gov or citizens pockets.

- Preventing that accumulation is normally done throught taxation and forcing them to pay their employees a normal wage (aka a ""legal minimal wage"" that isn't a vast joke).

&gt; That tends to refute your point only 5,000 people out of 310 million make any money. 

The average US citizen is ~~living~~ surviving with large debts, whether medical, a mortgage, school, car, credit card debt etc or just plainly the bills wiping the entire income.

What do that mean having an ""income"" when it just disappear the next minute as fast and the actual disposable income part don't exist because it's all immediately recovered by some banker for your house loan ?

&gt; The top 50% accounts for 98% of federal tax receipts. 

Yes, and you are using that number in a semi dishonest manner : Out of that if 40% of those (top 50%) have barely anything more than the (bottom 50%), it means the 10% of (top 50%) are paying very little for what they actually earn.

Let me help you understand that with a graph :
http://www.impactefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/2007_IncomeTaxRates.png

See those millionaires on the right ? They pay what's for them pocket money for taxes. It means the rest of the millions are just stashed away in their account and never cycling, while those on the low end of that bracked who make 100K are getting fucked over.

And next thing you know, the millionaire who pay nothing use the image of the 100K guy getting fucked over as an excuse to lower taxes for his bracket and pay even less.

&gt;  Not to mention, if you are simply using wages as a gauge, there is far more ""slave labor"" in the EU than the US. 

Except people here don't have 50 000 USD worth of debts. The average EU citizen don't have debts. Which means if his income grow, it just grow. It's not sheared away from him by the latest shark loaner 1% who dictate laws that made every important schools and hospital for profit by bribing politicians for it.

In the US, billionaires should be millionaires and some millionaires just middle class so that an actual middle class that include most of the population can exist with that wealth. But saying it out loud or seriously acting on it will get you kennedy'ed or suppressed for communism. The republicans would sooner start a civil war than stop gorging on bribe and ""free market"" money. 

And for those who think i exagerate, see those billionaires in russia living on stolen money ? Wouldn't it be better if they were merely multi millionnaire and that money was used to build [roads](https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=groowe&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=russia+roads&amp;tbm=isch&amp;gws_rd=ssl) and hospitals like it should ?

Ah. All right. Understood.

As a matter of fact it can. Because classification has nothing to do with that. Things can be fit into the system of classification at a later point.

&gt;Ex: Electricity isn't a subset of TV

This example is misplaced.

And, referring to the original issue - all we are speaking about now has nothing to do with the broad definition of ""Fascism"" which is so convenient to stuff all kinds of things into. Nobody really knows what kind of animal is that. So that very much depends upon the point of view of the one who does that. So, again, if National Socialism can be fit into the abstract ""broad definition"" of the thing called ""Fascism"", so can be Communism.

To criticise the quality is ok, to criticise the cost is also ok, not paying because you think, in america I do not have to pay these, is not ok (If you work and live in a another country, you have to follow the rules and laws of your host country).

 I mean there are several legal ways of protest, you can organize a demonstration against the fee, you can make petitions, support political parties who want to demolish the fee or even found your own political party to get a change in german policy (The greens have shown that something like this can be succesfull and the Piraten have shown how a party self destructs (as an bad example, while I would have loved a few seats for them in the oposition to bring a bit more IT knowledege in the parliament.) 

On the other hand the majority of my fellow germans seem to like what is offered to them (at least it seems to be not important enough to demonstrate against it), especially the old folk who are the majority in germany, therefore the program is mostly tailored to them / their taste. 

Sure I complain also that the fee is to high something around 8€ would be enough like the fee for the BBC in the UK and the quality should at least be the same. While I personaly enjoy some Tatort, Quarks und Co, Panorama, Tatortreiniger, some shows on ZDFneo, the news in public TV that are presented less sensational, Sendung mit der Maus and Kika for the kids with less advertisment for toys as in private TV and some other stuff. 

Sure there will also be a lot of shows that are hard to acknowledge for people who did not grow up in germany and can not relate to them. Many foreigners just do not have the background information or the experience of living in germany in a certain decade to enjoy some of our shows, certain jokes just do not work if you never experienced the context. Or just let us say our tastes are different through our upbringing.

Another thing americans tend to forget regarding media, the german domestic market is way smaller than the american market with 320 mil possible viewers vs. 80 mil possible viewers, even if you count all the inhabitants of german speaking countries as possible viewers the number of possible viewers who have english as their native language is higher. Dubbing seem to be a no go in the US. So even if in europe a successful movie is produced, they tend to make their own version in the US from scratch (Example the  Millennium-Trilogy ). With this it is very hard to sell enough copies of a cinema movie without the american market, to make something with a budget of a hollywood movie. In germany on the other hand dubbing is widely accepted, therefore it makes more sense to support / buy hollywood productions and dub the movies/series later.

Baltics are not one country - we each have different issues and beliefs of how to defend our countries.

I am not advocating for anything like that, on the contrary I was pointing out that it does not make sense to use that statistic at all since it does not describe situation in the border areas.

no it is a caricature that is black. Sinterklaas is a caricature of a specific white person. Other than them being black and being the 'knecht' there is nothing about them that compares to slavery.

I think the notion that pretending to black is a bad thing, might acutally be racist, like there is something wrong with being black. but pretending to be black, I just can't see what is wrong with that.

I also roll my eyes at the way she expresses it, but in no way would I think she harbors ill will with that sentiment and put into a context of an able catholic older lady trying to do good for the less fortunate and nothing more.

That is a very kind and loving perspective to have towards your grandmother, and I'm sure she is a lovely woman, but that that doesn't excuse her racism - if anything it only makes it more insidious and harder to address. [Racism is not just a thing done by awful people trying to hurt others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=BE&amp;v=MbdxeFcQtaU), but a reflection of what happens when we let our natural cognitive biases and moral failings mix in a way that overwhelms our natural compassion and empathy. That your grandmother said ""negertjes"" when she should have said lieve kleine kinderen doesn't mean she is an awful woman, but it does mean that she may be liable to say and do some other hurtful stuff without meaning to cause harm. 

That is indeed pretty not ok, even if it is in a way that doesn't even necessarily reflect poorly on her.

&gt;Can't we just move past it and say: yes, every sane Belgian rejects our colonial past and it's a part of our history that both shames us and we'd never like to see repeated again, but without rejecting everything that came forth from that moment in time?

I'm not sure anyone is calling for all of Kuifje to be rejected because of the virulently racist volumes, or for the Zwarte Pieten to be banned outright rather than just edited a bit more, or even for these people to stop telling everyone about the money they're giving to charity.  However, part of rejecting Belgium's genocidally colonial past necessarily involves no longer celebrating it.

&gt;We shouldn't call people who destroy stuff vandals because it's offensive to the historic struggle of old Germanic Vandal peoples from a Roman point of view. We shouldn't call the West North-African ethnicity Berber either anymore because that also stems from Roman racism etymologically (the Barbarians). I urge all Slavic langauge to rename Germany to something that does not say ""mute people""... where do you stop?

There is a difference in how there are no more Roman armies or subjugated Vandals left and how Latin is a dead language that long ago lost the ability to oppress North Africans.  Belgian racism however, is not the stuff of folklore. The ideas and thought patterns that justified one of the greatest genocides in human history are alive and well in Belgian society.",null,0,null,1427047189,null,0,false,0,cpn3y0o,null,t3_2zw7lw,null,t1_cpn3y0o,null,t1_cpn1zsc,null,null,null,1431950511,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

&gt;On the other UKIP has managed to make racist rhetoric appear reasonable. They don't require voters to follow them into the murky dumps of hatred like GD, because they've given hatred a face life and brought it into the mainstream. And voters are falling for it, because it allows them to indulge their worst side without feeling guilty. 

This seems to be an accusation that is levelled by people who hold contempt for the nation state. The primary function of government is the defence of the realm, and it is therefore logical and reasonable that this should include defence of our borders. This is what really seems to rile people about UKIP. Behind all the accusations of ""waycism"" and ""hitler"" is the anomisty that they do not believe in European unity and that they both oppose and criticise mass immigration. That's the reason some simpletons want to compare them to Golden dawn. It's merely a tactic to demonise people they disagree with.

Exactly! That is the point! Any, even the most fantastic theory can prevail if its supporters ""have arguments"". Many have a lot of good arguments, so they construct a lot of good looking, nice sounding, well structure (or less well, whatever) theories. (So do their opponents too, in case you were wondering). So people come to believe that this wonderful theory is correct because it is so convincing. The problem is, these theories (hypotheses) can't be put to test in a lab to prove who is wrong and who is right. So the test comes as a moment of truth and often costs millions of lives.

Well, as the particular case, National-Socialists and Marxists in Weimar Republic explicitly fought for the same power base, the Proletariat. I am not even mentioning obvious similarities of the regimes of Nazi Reich and USSSR.

&gt; From the very first day of the battle, everywhere on the island, Cretan civilians – men, women, children, priests, monks, and even nuns, armed and otherwise – joined the battle with whatever weapons were at hand. In some cases, ancient matchlock rifles which had last been used against the Turks were dug up from their hiding places and pressed into action. In other cases, civilians went into action armed only with what they could gather from their kitchens or barns, and several German parachutists were knifed or clubbed to death in the olive groves that dotted the island. In one recorded case of extreme brutality against the German Fallschirmjäger, an elderly Cretan man clubbed a parachutist to death with his walking cane before the German could disentangle himself from his parachute lines.[70] In another, a priest and his son broke into a village museum and took two rifles from the era of the Balkan Wars and sniped at German paratroops at one of the landing zones. While the priest would aim and shoot at German paratroopers with one rifle, his son would re-load the other. The Cretans soon supplemented their makeshift weapons with captured German small arms taken from the bodies of dead paratroops and glider troops. Their actions were not limited to harassment—civilians also played a significant role in the Greek counter-attacks at Kastelli Hill and Paleochora; the British and New Zealand advisors at these locations were hard pressed to prevent massacres. Civilian action also checked the Germans to the north and west of Heraklion, and in the town centre itself.[71]
&gt; 
&gt; This was the first occasion in the war that the Germans encountered widespread and unrestrained resistance from a civilian population, and for a period of time, it unbalanced them. However, once they had recovered from their shock, the German paratroopers reacted with equal ferocity, killing many Cretan civilians. Two examples of such extreme brutallity towards Cretan civilians are the Holocaust of Viannos (Greek: Ολοκαύτωμα της Βιάννου) and the Massacre of Kondomari (Greek: Σφαγή στο Κοντομαρί). The Holocaust of Viannos was a mass extermination campaign launched by the German forces against the civilian residents of around 20 villages located in the areas east of Viannos and west of Ierapetra provinces on Crete. The killings, with a death toll in excess of 500, were carried out on 14–16 September 1943 by Wehrmacht units. They were accompanied by the burning of most villages, and the looting and destruction of harvests.[72][73] The massive loss of life amounted to one of the deadliest massacres during the Axis occupation of Greece. It was ordered by Generalleutnant Friedrich-Wilhelm Müller, in retaliation for the support and involvement of the local population in the Cretan resistance. Müller, who earned the nickname ""the Butcher of Crete"", was executed after the war for his part in the massacre. 
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, as most Cretan partisans wore no uniforms or identifying insignia such as armbands or headbands, the Germans felt free of all of the constraints implied by the Hague conventions and killed both armed and unarmed civilians indiscriminately.",null,0,null,1427048875,null,0,false,0,cpn4uni,null,t3_2zwuik,null,t1_cpn4uni,null,t1_cpn4p3a,null,null,null,1431950938,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

Funding is very different and was simply pointed as the reason as to why Baltic states do not have considerable military equipments or weapons. Finland uses its whole budget to itself, while all Baltic states have their own, so efficiency of the combines Baltic militaries is weak. ""Some data"", yes you need something that you use to do the comparisons. Estonian military budget was not why Baltic nations are weaker, they are weaker because they do not have weapons, budget is the reason why they do not have those weapons. As for nonsense about US vs Nordics you said, it is not worth an comment. You for whatever idiotic reason really got caught on that Estonian budget, I have mentioned the combined military budget of all three Baltic states twice as well, nevermind the other factors which you completely ignore and keep on giving bullshit about some fucking Estonian budget I only mentioned is comparable to our acquisition budget. Its not a point of a lot value in this discussion. -&gt; your don't seem to read or understand anything I have written.    
    
As for my rudeness, so fucking what? I have zero problems being rude, it seems to be your problem. You said stupid shit about countries size and somehow made that a reason why we cannot do comparison here. As a Finn I compare military of my country to Russia, its quite more capable to do stuff than we are, it is quite a bit larger than we are, it however does not make it stupid or annoying to do.   
     
Territory is indeed good information to have as well, but that was not really the question here. Finland is bigger, it gives them more ground to fight on without risking losing stratetigally important areas, which again is better for Finland, where as in Baltics many of the important locations and targets are very close to each other and there is very little area to manouver. This can be good or bad for defender, but if you lack equipment to fight this is sort of a moot point.

Deutschland wollte eine Pleite im Jahr 2010 nicht. Deswegen steckt Griecheland jetzt in der Scheiße. Warum wollte Deutschland die Pleite nicht? Das hätte der Deutschen Bank und den Renditeträchtigen Anlagen der Oberschicht ziemlich weh getan... 

&gt; Wie gesagt, die Griechen haben sich ihren Lebenstil mit Schulden erkauft und irgendwer (ich vermute sehr stark wir), war so doof ihnen die ganze Zeit mehr Geld zu geben.

Welcher Lebensstil? Du meinst, dass es keine Sozialleistungen gibt nach einem Jahr Arbeitslosigkeit? Die miese Kranken- und Gesundsheitsversorgung? Die Ineffiziente öffentliche Verwaltung? Das Geld von uns ist direkt wieder zurück geflossen. Griechenland hat jetzt die Schulden zu bezahlen und wird dafür ausgequetscht... 

Alle Statistiken widersprechen deiner These, dass der Lebensstil entscheidend dafür ist... das ist nämlich eher ein Klischee. 

Zudem ist die Austeritätspolitik durchaus umstritten. Dafür müsste man aber mal Varoufakis zuhöhren...

I'd say whenever you dress up specifically as a member of a different race and then partake in some ritual activity, the message is clearly ""this is what people of this race do, this is what they symbolize"".

Of course, if this ritual is normal for you, you might not see it for what it is. People can participate in spreading a racist message without being racists.

Yup. I think the solution would just be for them to keep the costumes, just not paint their faces black. I don't think it's that big of a change.

What you do, is hold on to some sort of stubbornness, which isn't subject to any reasonable argument about how Noirauds and Black Pete aren't racist, but only to a rejection of minority influence on Belgium/Dutch traditions.

Because arguing whether it is or isn't racist always boils down to ''THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT AFRICANS'' and ''THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT AFRICANS'' it doesn't make sense to argue about what a fake caricature of a non-existent character is supposed to represent. Because nobody will ever change their opinion about it. I'll be honest even, and say I don't know jackshit about this tradition. But I think if people want to practise it, they should be able to.

&gt; You do have the right to offend, but you also have the obligation to consider whether you are in your right to offend someone solely on their skin color.

Yes, I do. I've got the right to offend everyone I want to offend. Have you ever seen Christian comedy? If not, it's for a reason. Because it's boring. People disagreeing with me offend me though. So your right to freedom of speech might just end here.

&gt; If you come to the conclusion that you do, you better have a better explanation for it than 'just because I can I should'.

No, my explanation is, because I can, I can. I won't do it because I don't want to offend anyone, and that's fine. If someone however is feeling edgy today and wants to paint his face black, he should be free to.

null,false,jfads89a,null,null,null,"Ich habe zwar einen Master in einem spezialisierten Informatikfeld, aber meinen Erfahrungen nach hätte für alles, was ich bisher gemacht habe, ein Bachelor ausgereicht.

Da die wenigsten Informatiker auch in wirklichen Informatikerjobs landen, sondern 0815-Coder in 0815-Firmen werden, könnte man sich theoretisch das gesamte Studium sparen, solange man Können und Willen beweisen kann.

Ich bin auf viele Leute getroffen, die keine formale Ausbildung hatten und einfach schon immer gerne programmiert haben und genug logisches Verständnis für guten Code aufbringen können.
Ansonsten gab es auch viele Fachinformatiker oder Quereinsteiger aus der Mathematik und Physik.

Das ist auch nicht verwunderlich, weil man bis auf wenige Ausnahmen im Studium auch keinen Skill lernt, der tatsächlich im Alltag relevant ist. Und sogar für das typische Programmierpraktikum im Studium muss man sich das Programmieren selbst beibringen.

Letztendlich dient das abgeschlossene Studium als Beweis, dass man dir jede noch so komplexe Aufgabenstellung vorlegen kann und du sie in kurzer Zeit löst.
Deswegen finden sich auch so viele Quereinsteiger aus Physik und Mathe unter den Codern. Als Informatiker hat man mit diesen beiden Studiengängen einen massiven Querschnitt wegen des hohen Mathematikanteils.

In der Informatik kommt wegen des etwas besonderes Lehrplans noch hinzu, dass der Master oder das Ende des Bachelors von vielen als viel einfacher empfunden wird als die ersten paar Semester. Das liegt einfach daran, dass sich der von den meisten als schwierigste empfundene Teil des gesamten Studiums (theoretische Mathematik) direkt am Anfang konzentriert. Berichten von Freunden nach ist das sonst bei den wenigsten Studiengängen so.

Wie schon erwähnt wurde ist ein Master nur von Vorteil, wenn du in ein ganz spezifisches R&amp;D Feld einsteigen willst oder notwendig, wenn du in der universitären Forschung bleiben willst.

Von letzterem kann ich aber nur massiv abraten, außer du bist ein Idealist mit ungebrochenem Forschungswunsch. Es gibt wohl kaum einen Studiengang, wo du so massiv schlechter in der Forschung als der Wirtschaft bezahlt wirst. Ich kenne viele Leute, die ihre Lebenszeit komplett dafür geopfert haben und mit effektiv weniger als dem Mindestlohn dafür belohnt wurden, um dann letztendlich doch in der Wirtschaft zu landen, weil man entweder Professor werden muss oder effektiv Berufsverbot bekommt.

Master steigen jedoch mit einem minimal höheren Lohn ein als Bachelor. Man muss hierbei aber bedenken, dass ein Bachelor mit 2 Jahren Berufserfahrung (statt 2 Jahren längerem Studium) aber im Normalfall gleich- oder vorbeizieht.

Und mach dir echt keine Sorgen. Das sagt sich so lapidar, aber als Informatiker hast du momentan freie Jobwahl und das schon mit einem Bachelor, was ein ziemliches Exklusivprivileg in der Welt der Studiengänge ist. Das ist wohl der einzige Bereich, wo der vielbeschworene Fachkräftemangel kein Schmunzeln bei mir hervorruft. Lass dich nur nich mit einem zu niedrigen Gehalt abspeisen. ;)

Falls es bei der Beruhigung hilft, ich habe lange im Studium getrödelt, zwei mal den Fachbereich gewechselt, viele Klausuren sausen lassen und Fehlversuche kassiert, weil ich einfach zu faul war und durchgeschlafen habe und so effektiv 14 Semester nur für den Bachelor gebraucht, erst mit 26 das erste mal sowas wie gearbeitet und am Ende trotzdem sofort einen guten Job ohne große Nachfragen bekommen.",null,0,null,1427049873,null,0,false,0,cpn5dxs,null,t3_2zwgox,null,t1_cpn5dxs,null,t3_2zwgox,null,null,null,1431951194,null,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1,null

Wurde auch langsam Zeit. :)

Arbeit war unspektakulär, da ist halt was zu tun, Messe nächsten Monat, man kanns sich denken.

Mittwoch war aber spontan das Wetter so mega geil, dass ich mich mit nem Kollegen getroffen hab um per Home Office im Park zu arbeiten bzw. zu lernen.

Mit anderen Worten, wir hatten Papierkram im Rucksack dabei und mit zwei Mädels die vorbeikamen und neidisch auf unseren Grill gelinst haben den ganzen Tag gegrillt, in der Sonne gelegen, Bierchen getrunken und Flunkyball gezockt. So muss dat.

Donnerstag und Freitag wieder Arbeiten gewesen, Freitag dann auf einem Geburtstag. Ich bin gegen 18 Uhr dort hin gefahren, hab mich nett unterhalten und bin gegen 12 Uhr am nächsten Morgen zuhause wach geworden. Was dazwischen passiert ist, weiß alleine WhatsApp.

Mit dem MEGA Kater bin ich dann gestern trotzdem noch meinen Verpflichtungen nachgekommen und zu unserer DRK Wache gefahren, da musste ein wenig Kram aus- und umsortiert werden.

Im Sinne der aktuellen Entwicklung in Osteuropa werden im Katastrophenschutz leider die Klamotten aus dem letzten kalten Krieg ausgemistet und die Klamotten für den nächsten Eingekauft und gelagert. :/

Spannend war es trotzdem, ich hab mir eine Gasmaske mit Filter gegen biologische und chemische Kampfstoffe reserviert, hergestellt 06 / 1980.

Wie eine Zeitreise! :)

Abends war ich dann trotzdem entsprechend im Eimer und hab gut gepennt, heute Laufen gewesen und den Kram von Mittwoch nachgeholt, vorhin noch Einkaufen gewesen weil ich das irgendwie verbaselt hab die Woche und nu sitz ich hier und erfreue mich der Tatsache, dass ich mir morgen was über ""Formale Sprachen und Compilerbau"" anhören darf.

Und Angesichts der damaligen (und vermutlich noch immer vorhandenen) Finanzmiesere nicht nur denen.

Die privaten Schuldner haben ja schon einen ersten Schuldenschnitt hinnehmen müssen. Die anderen nicht...

&gt; Welcher Lebensstil? Du meinst, dass es keine Sozialleistungen gibt nach einem Jahr Arbeitslosigkeit? Die miese Kranken- und Gesundsheitsversorgung?

Nein, es gibt einen Unterschied zwischen einem Sozialstaat und dem Austeilen von Geschenken durch Aufnahme von Schulden bei gleichzeitiger massiver Misswirtschaft. Wie ich oben schon schrieb: Dass in Griechenland extrem Steuern hinterzogen wird wurde mir schon Anfang 2007 von Griechen als großes Problem in Griechenland genannt.

Griechenland ist zunächst einmal nicht wegen der Bankenkrise in die Krise geraten so wie Spanien, Portugal oder Irland. Griechenland war schon vorher ein Problem und die Schuldenfalle war schon vorher zugeschnappt. Unter anderen Umständen hätte Griechenland den Staatsbankrott erklärt und dann hätte man gesehen wie es weitergeht.

&gt; Zudem ist die Austeritätspolitik durchaus umstritten. Dafür müsste man aber mal Varoufakis zuhöhren...

Wo habe ich denn behauptet, die Austeritätspolitik sei der richtige Weg für Griechenland? Mein Ausgangsposting sagte nur, dass irgendwer den Griechen das ganze Geld geliehen hat und wir werden uns, glaube ich, noch wundern, wer das war. (Und sollten deshalb nicht so hochnäsig sein.) Allerdings glaube ich auch, dass Griechenland auch nach einem Staatsbankrott massive Hilfen brauchen wird, denn sie werden es sehr schwer haben neue Schulden aufzunehmen. (Stichwort Oberschicht: Wer glaubst du denn kauft Staatsanleihen?)

Nochmal: Mir geht es nicht darum den Griechen allein den schwarzen Peter zuzuschieben. Aber man soll bitte auch nicht so tun, als wären sie vollkommen unschuldig in die Miesere gerutscht und nur das arme Opfer der Finanzmärkte. Die haben natürlich ihren Anteil an der Misere. Mir ging es in meinen Posts auch darum die hiesige Hochnäsigkeit bei der Griechenlanddiskussion zu kritisieren.

Almost all of you Turks don't get it because you are too much the jingoistic lunatics, the rest of the world doesn't care how you atomize groups like Kurds into ""good Kurds that are subservient to Turkish ultra-nationalism""(which would be Turks of Kurdish origin, who don't outwardly manifest Kurdish identity versus bad Kurds who support HPG/PKK/PYD.

Beaucoup d'universitaires, pourtant très intéressés par la politique, ne votent pas. Je prendrais l'exemple d'Alain Garrigou qui en parle ouvertement (source : Il a été mon prof).

War vor drei Wochen auf 'nem Colour Haze-Konzert in Köln, Vorbands waren Radio Moscow und Sun and the Wolf. War ein wirklich großartiges Konzert.

Der Ablauf der Tage danach war eigentlich nur: Arbeit, zocken, Fußball gucken. Hab Tomb Raider aus dem Jahre 2013 durchgezockt, cooles Spiel, kann ich jedem empfehlen! 

Vor 'ner Woche hab ich mit meinem 6. Playthrough von Mass Effect begonnen, bin jetzt gerade im 2. Teil und spiel diesmal als abtrünniger Shepard, was ich vorher nie übers Herz bekommen hab. :D

Freitag hab ich mich nochmal nach längerer Zeit gnadenlos betrunken, hab ab ca. 1 Uhr 'nen Filmriss und hab keine Erinnerung daran wie ich nach Hause gekommen bin. Dementsprechend hing ich gestern nur mit Laptop im Bett rum und hab mich zum Kotzen gefühlt. Warum trinkt man eigentlich?

null,false,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,null,"&gt; Once upon a time, Britain entered the ERM—and therefore accepted to keep the fluctuation in the exchange rate between the pound and other member currencies under 6%—, a system that aimed to achieve monetary stability within Europe and paved the way for the Eurozone. Then Britain failed to comply with said mechanism, Black Wednesday happened, and simply agreed with its European partners to withdraw.

While the UK did end up falling out of the ERM, I'm not sure that this was a breach of an obligation by the UK. Separately, as a policy it was completely insane as currencies should be able to float against each other as it reflects underlying strength and weakness of an economy. Economic historians in the UK now call ""black Wednesday"", ""white Wednesday"" as it enabled the UK economy to recover and was ultimately one of the reasons that kept the UK out of the euro, with the pound, which is what is best for the UK.

I agree that the fiscal compact is bullshit and bad for France. But you did agree to it again in 2011, just a few years ago. And your government has not said that it should be renegotiated. I kind of wish your government had more balls! However, can the eurozone really be fixed at this stage? I am not sure that it can.

And even when they're constructed in China, it's all overseen by American quality assurance engineers who make sure it's being done right and up to our standards. The only reason they're constructed in China is because it requires some amount of menial labor, which is the same anywhere (anyone can do menial work), and China is where menial labor happens to be the cheapest right now.",null,0,null,1427053282,null,0,false,0,cpn76sh,null,t3_2zu3mr,null,t1_cpn76sh,null,t1_cpmu17h,null,null,null,1431952108,null,-18,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-18,null

null,false,Thyrotoxic,UKGB,United Kingdom,null,"&gt;In July 1995, the Bosnian Serbs launched an attack on the Bosnian town of Srebrenica, ending with the deaths of approximately 8,000 civilians in the Srebrenica massacre. After the horrifying events at Srebrenica, 16 nations met at the London Conference, beginning on July 21, 1995, to consider new options for Bosnia. As a result of the conference, UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali gave General Bernard Janvier, the UN military commander, the authority to request NATO airstrikes without consulting civilian UN officials, as a way to streamline the process. As a result of the conference, the North Atlantic Council and the UN also agreed to use NATO air strikes in response to attacks on any of the other safe areas in Bosnia. The participants at the conference also agreed in principle to the use of large-scale NATO air strikes in response to future acts of Serb aggression.

The UN was pretty involved in stopping Serbians murdering people and committing even more genocide.

If you're talking about the 1999 bombings the UN wasn't involved. Still it's a good idea to intervene to stop widespread genocide by the Serbs.

le notizie, gli articoli e gli approfondimenti non sono più gratis, ma hanno un costo come la musica i giochi, etc. Potrà forse non piacere, ma gli editori hanno deciso di passare ad un modello pay dovuto ad un tema di pura sopravvivenza. La stampa nazionale e internazionale ha abbondantemente spiegato e annunciato tale trasformazione. In tutti i modi il cliente paga la connettività nelle sue forme prepagate e postpagate, ma non i contenuti che si trovano su internet. È facoltà di ogni content provider di scegliere se far o non far pagare i propri contenuti. In tal caso le notizie diventeranno a pagamento come per le App di iPhone (anche se in forma differente). La convenienza comunque sta nel fatto che, nel far pagare il contenuto, il traffico non è tariffato. I clienti, navigando su tali siti, saranno avvisati e potranno accettare di aderire o di non aderire e quindi di non accedere alle notizie. Per quanto concerne siffatti siti, semplicemente non siamo tenuti a tenere siffatto elenco: è infatti decisione del singolo sito se far procedere l’utente con navigazione a pagamento. 3 si limita ad accreditare al sito stesso le relative somme. L’utente viene in ogni caso avvisato e messo in condizione di accettare, o meno, di aderire. 
Aggiungiamo, inoltre, che come chiaramente e costantemente indicato sul nostro sito ufficiale www.tre.it, sul nostro portale mobile App&amp;Store la navigazione a pagamento, con un addebito per pagina. Ma ciò è appunto specificato. 
Ogni altra informazione è comunque reperibile sul ns sito ufficiale www.tre.it 
Aggiungiamo come sempre che chiunque, per qualsivoglia motivo, dovesse ritenere di riscontrare presunti addebiti anomali, non ha che da segnalarcelo. Provvederemo a fornire assistenza immediata e puntuale. Grazie e buona giornata #SocialCare3

Et pourquoi ? Voter, c'est admettre qu'on croit en ce système. C'est admettre que l'on jouera avec les règles du jeu. On ne peut pas à la fois accepter les règles du jeu, et se plaindre du résultat. Si tu ne voulais pas soutenir, il ne fallait pas voter.

À l'inverse, celui qui n'a pas voté n'a pas donné sa voix, n'a pas donné son accord pour que l'élu obtienne le poste électoral dans lequel il aura montré son incompétence ou sa malhonnêteté.

Les capitaux nécessaires à une candidature solide sont assez simple : capital symbolique du militant pour un candidat de gauche, capital symbolique de l'accomplissement social (réussite personnelle) à droite, capital économique pour les deux. Les seuls qui ont les moyens d'avoir tous ces capitaux, ce sont ceux qui font parti d'une noblesse d'État, ou les plus riches. C'est pas par ce que n'importe qui peut voter que n'importe qui peut se présenter - et réussir.

I think the point is to gain a certain form of anonymity nowadays, but if we could change the color I don't think there would be that big of a problem. I can understand where they are coming from, since asking them to change that is indirectly not believing they don't do this out of racist motives. The change would only be symbolic of a mindset change that already happened some time ago. 

And I guess people get on their defensive high horses when hearing people asking to demote the Minister of Foreign Affairs and linking that to the 'blackface' issue in the US that has nothing to do with this. Some people attach a lot of emotional value to this and I really don't see how it promotes racism, so I genuinely think that this scandal is not helping the victims of racism.

&gt;I'd say whenever you dress up specifically as a member of a different race and then partake in some ritual activity, the message is clearly ""this is what people of this race do, this is what they symbolize"". 

(Well that's the thing with racism, there's no such thing as a different 'human race'.) 

If you follow that line of reasoning disguising yourself in a lot of things can be condemned. If a kid dresses up like a Native American he's being racist, if I disguise myself in a woman I would be sexist. The Swarthies aren't even making such point, the goal was to attract attention by disguising yourself in something very unusual and never seen at the time.

Thank you for agreeing with me, and I hope you do as you say. 

However, I've seen black people being called Zwarte Piet by a cunt for as long as I can remember, and most of the time surrounded by a group of people who think its absolutely hilarious. And I'm not speaking of the sort of idiots like those at the Malieveld demonstration last year, but normal, intelligent, well travelled people. This is because it is acceptable in our society to joke about our colored colleagues, neighbours, and friends about how they resemble Zwarte Piet, and as long as Zwarte Piet still resembles the black man or women, I don't see this changing.

&gt; Why do people tell their children that the guy rides a horse on people's roofs, instead of being a Turkish Christian saint, if there's nothing to hide? Please, tell me.

I don't think this is considered a secret, even to children, that people attempt to deny at all costs. However if you point out how Zwarte Piet slighty looks like a stereotype from a distant past, people go nuts.
