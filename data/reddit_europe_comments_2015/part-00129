Your last comment that the IRA were fighting for independence is an argument that has been fought over since the founding of the free state. 

I'd say the theme of the history books I had in school was that after decades of campaigning the Westminster parliament was lying. Even though the Irish MPs got the home rule bill passed the British abandoned the parliamentary system by as you say committing sedition. So in 1916 the Irish committed their own bit of sedition in an attempt to gain full independence. The fact that the home rule bill was on the books was portrayed as inconsequential. It was never going to be implemented because the British poisoned Irish politics.

I don't agree with this. It was just the impression I got from the books. I think they glossed over the sectarianism and the economic inequality in Irish society to tell a simpler story of noble Ireland against deceitful Albion.

""Feel like a moose would feel"" and ""feel horrified"" could be written the same way in Finnish.      
In this context ""minua pikkusen"" is ""I am feeling a little bit""    

You could also say that 

    hirveä hirvittää = the moose is ((contemplating the future and) feeling) horrified
    hirveä hirvettää = the moose would really want some *moose* booty/d (not deer or some other)
    hirveä hirvittää = the moose desires to be/act/feel like the moose generally are/act/feel.
    hirveä hirvittää = horribility terrifies
 
""moose"" and ""horrible"" have several overlapping inflections. 

    hirvi       = moose
    hirviö      = monster
    hirveä      = horrible (OR moose meat/dish OR the partitive of moose)
    hirvittää   = horrifies, feel horrified (OR feel like a moose would feel OR wanting to be like a moose)
    hirvittävän = horribly, extremely (OR the cause/outcome of somebody feeling like a moose would feel)

He could probably have continued for hours by dad-translating his ponderings about moose emotions, moose desires and about the extreme tastiness of moose dishes.

Or he could have continued with these dadslations:

    Kuusi palaa = A spruce is on fire.
    Kuusi palaa = Six pieces.
    Kuusi palaa = Your moon is on fire.
    Kuusi palaa = Your moon is returning.
    Kuusi palaa = The six are returning.
    Kuusi palaa = The six are on fire.
    Kuusi palaa = A spruce is returning.
    Kuusi palaa = The number six is on fire.
    Kuusi palaa = The number six is returning.
    Kuusi palaa = The Christmas tree is on fire
    Kuusi palaa = The Christmas tree is returning

You might now wonder if Finns can understand each other at all. Maybe we deep down don't, but     
the context is usually enough, and if it isn't, you can use the same longer sentence structure as you would use in English to remove ambiguities.

It was not in the US &amp; Britain's interest to cripple Germany in the same way that the Soviet Union did after the second world war. As part of the ""change"" needed to get Europe back on track, the US instituted the Marshall plan (among others), which instated ""free money"" as part of the plan. Greece was one of the receiver ends of the bargain (at $376m, a sum larger than what Germany imposed on them earlier in deutchmarks). The US also instilled large amounts of funds in what we call ""recycling mechanism"" which helped all the Western nations grow further. As part of ALL of this, the US &amp; Britain also requested ""nicely"" that nations would stop requiring war reparation money.

In an European world where countries expect others to act with decency, morallity &amp; culturally uptight. Greece ends up failing in all accounts. Germany et all provided Greece with 2 bailouts. These bailout terms required interest rate discounts &amp; face value cuts. In other words, imagine you lend me $100 at an interest rate of 10% because you know I am a crappy neighbour. Right after you give me the $100, you already scratch off $53 of the value + decreases the interest rate to 3%. That is a garbage investment to say the least...

Anyway, the idea is simple. Its impossible to request government &amp; nations to be fiscally responsible, morally uptight when the economy is doing well. When things go down hill, that is the opportunity you have to put countries back on track. Otherwise you will see another catastrophe in the future and it might take everyone else with you

Ah je ne suis pas sûr que les inventions viennent de ça. À mon avis, c'est surtout dû à une caractéristique de l'espèce humaine : on n'est jamais rassasié, on en veut toujours plus.

&gt;Le sommeil est tres important. Si tu manque beacoup du sommeil ca te rend depressiv, diminue les capacites du systeme immunitaire et diminue aussi la memoire et les capacites cognitives.

Je n'ai pas dit que ce n'était pas important. Mais ça n'est pas pour cela que je n'aime pas ça. Tu ne peux pas me reprocher de ne pas aimer rester allongé à rien foutre dans mon lit. Comme je l'ai dit, ça ne m'apporte aucun plaisir, et si je pouvais m'en passer je le ferais.

&gt;En conclusion je dirait de manger mieux (et plus), et de dormir plus

Dans quel but ? Je n'ai pas dit que je me sous-alimentais ou que je me privais de sommeil. J'arrête de manger quand je n'ai plus faim, il est d'ailleurs conseillé de ne pas trop se remplir le bide, surtout le soir.

Le Bistro des Gastronomes is a gem that serves fantastic French food at well under your price point.  I love the food, the service, and the beautiful dishes.  Near Jussieu Metro in the 5th: 10 rue Cardinal-Lemoine, 75005.  
La Cordonnerie is somewhat less artful in execution, but the depth of flavor and traditional technique make up for a less impressive plating.  Near Pyramides and Tuileries Metros in the 1st:  20 rue Saint Roch, 75001.
This location is at the bottom of the list as it's the food I dream of in cold weather, and her birthday is summertime...

No. Even though the creditors have even signed an agreement they would offer more debt relief, have you heard any politician of the creditor countries saying that?

&gt; In 1989, the coalition government between Nea Dimokratia and the Coalition of Left and Progress (SYNASPISMOS) – in which the KKE was for a period the major force – suggested a law that was passed unanimously by the Greek Parliament, formally recognizing the 1946–1949 war as a civil war and not merely as a communist insurgency (""Συμμοριτοπόλεμος"") ( Ν. 1863/89 (ΦΕΚ 204Α΄) ).[58][59][60] Under the terms of this law, the war of 1946–1949 was recognized as a Greek Civil War between the National Army and the Democratic Army of Greece, for the first time in Greek postwar history. Under the aforementioned law, the term ""communist bandits"" (Κομμουνιστοσυμμορίτες, ΚΣ), wherever it had occurred in Greek law, was replaced by the term ""Fighters of the DSE"".

Basically, in the earlier years he would be tried as an insurgent and executed. After the fall of the Junta he would be tried and imprisoned as a deserter.

That said, I must point a thing or two cause you seem to miss *that* point completely even thought you are reffering to it in some vague way.

- 1st of all you should stop reffering to decency in that onesided manner.  You reffer to my country as it failed in all accounts when it comes to decency and  morality. How very dare you?
When does decency and morality  starts for you? 90s? 80s? 70s? Why not 40s?
When was decency and morality when your country burned mine to the ground?
  
You see what happens?  When reffering to ethics about another nation you provoke them to bring back memories. You provoke them to do the comparisons. 

That is what's happening since 2009 with German polititians and media. They are reffering to us, as cons and lazy that we lack any morality. We've been even told to sell an island or FFS the acropolis. 
So  STOP this hypocritical high morality attitude.  It will only backfire bringing comparisons. 
There are still people alive today that suffered hell back then. 
Are you calling them moraly failed too?
So shut the fuck up about moral issues get off your high horse and lets stop calling names each other. Lets work **TOGETHER**.

- For what Americans did with the Marshal plan, we are deeply greatful to them. 
Let them tell us about the reasons and requests they had for it. Not YOU FFS. You are playing it ethical with other nations (US and British) good actions.

- Germany provided the bail outs only to save **their**  irresponsible banks that lent money to our irresponsible goverments. It takes two you see for that failure.  
That *help* went directly to those banks and saved them from any consequences.  Shouldnt they be criticized for their failure too? Or do you thing they made an ""honest"" mistake giving away those money? Dont let me start. 

When the 1st bailout was given there was political pressure from the German and French governments for Greece to buy tanks (from Germany) and ships (from France) for example. At the same time, they demanded to cut expenses to public helth etc. As we speak when someone goes to a public hospital he/she must bring the drugs with him. Most hospitals cant provide them. 
Where's the help and morality in that?

- the bailout program and its terms did more damage than good. It was a failure and even IMF already said so.

So please please please stop this rhetoric. It doesnt do any good. Not for you, nor for us.  
I love Germany and Germans and I am truly sad will all this agressive rhetorics from both sides.

Bah sinon, Istanbul c'est super. La ville est immense, il y a plein de choses à voir : depuis les monuments grecs, romains, byzantins, ottomans et du plus moderne pour ceux qui veulent. (Cette mosquée bleue... Je n'ai aucune difficulté à imaginer qu'un voyageur venant d'occident au XVème siècle, après avoir voyagé pendant des mois se convertisse direct à l'islam en découvrant ce monument !). J'étais plutôt dans un délire d'optimisation des visites historiques, donc je ne suis pas sorti en club à Taksim, mais d'autres voyageurs dans l'auberge de jeunesse où j'étais m'ont dit que ce n'était pas si mal et qu'on pouvait s'y amuser. Les Turcs sont sympas (malgré la dose de rabatteurs comme dans toute grande ville touristique), la bouffe est délicieuse (et aux prix honnêtes dès qu'on s'éloigne des zones touristiques), et c'est très facile de sortir des coins à touristes pour avoir un aperçu de la ""vraie vie indigène"". Par contre, les prix étaient bien entre deux et trois fois plus grands que dans la petite ville turque où je bosse actuellement, donc c'est un peu dommage.

J'ai vu moins de chats errants que là où je bosse, mais au moins autant de chiens (en meilleure santé cela dit). Ça reste quand même assez bizarre comme impression, d'après ce qu'on m'a dit il y aurait une histoire entre le prophète et un chat, ce qui fait que les Turcs ne vont pas chercher à attraper tous les chats de gouttière.

Bulletin météo pour /u/LyaDash : du soleil avec du beau ciel bleu toute la journée donc c'est très agréable, mais il y avait encore énormément de vent froid donc il ne faut pas sortir sans trois couches de vêtements sur le dos (j'ai bien croisé un mec vivant à Stockholm qui a dit ne pas être pas gêné par le froid, mais ça vaut ce que ça vaut).

**There were more than 10x more Russian nazi collaborators than Ukrainian during ww2** - maybe this is an indicator that Stalin wasnt a super nice guy and people still remembered the purges of the late 30s as well as the strafbat and NKVD komissars when they joined the unit? Maybe we weren't that much better than the Nazis even though our grandfathers and great uncles liberated Europe. The Soviet system was pretty fucking brutal, lest you forget.

The Russian part of your answer - ""How many degenerates have been borne of our lands? (We) need to start executing (firing squad) these fucking animals again. 

It's not black and white. Just because Ukraine has the Azov battalion doesn't mean everybody fighting on the Ukrainian side are Nazis. The current leader of Donetsk people's republic is a ""former"" neo-nazi btw, and a lot of the guys fighting for the separatists are ultra-nationalists who want to install a religious, Russian Orthodox state - you may not see them as fascists, but they're pretty extreme themselves.

If I am not mistaken, the young gentlemen in the picture are wearing [British navy uniforms](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v335/JimRad-Mac/summersailor.jpg). Lower Saxony post-ww2 was under [British control](http://www.english-online.at/history/world-war-2/german-occupation-zones-in-1946.gif).

Cross checking this with Royal Navy installations, it seems there was a SIGINT unit with HMS royal albert stationed in Cuxhaven, in a [former German base](http://baor-locations.org/CuxhavenKriegsMarine.aspx.html). Cuxhaven fits all above criteria, sitting north and between Bremen and Hamburg.

Under all these assumptions, Cuxhaven seems the most likely candidate, considering also that sailors/soldiers wouldn't travel too far on their shore leave. In any case, this narrows the number of cities by a significant amount, I hope it helps you on your search.

Hello - I'll do my beat to help.

&gt;* Are changing stations easily available at restaurants /cafes?

Only the bigger restaurants ie not the tiny local places but kids are loved here. Not to say change a poop diaper in the middle of a restaurant.

* How easy is to find organic whole milk in stores ? Is there a recommended brand that is easily available ?

Yes - most supermarkets carry a brand or two

* Do stores carry baby food pouches like Plum or Happy baby like in US?

Yes. Obviously not those brands. Any restaurant will heat up baby food if you are eating.  I'll send you a photo of whats in my local store. 

* Any other tips, please let us know.

Bring a light stroller - lots of stairs and uphill. Even if there are lifts at most metros, often a set of stairs will be involved. You will be offered help etc 

Kids are loved here. Lots of little playgrounds around. People will wave and talk to the kid. 

Make the kid drink more water than normal - the humidity and heat means they dehydrate faster.

If they use a soother / binkie, bring spares. The pharmacies sell them but not all the usa brands.  Diapers etc are the same.

Incase the kids emergency dept here is awesome. I'll link it up when I get home.

Dont underestimate the number of people or walking distances  - so plan for shorter trips so the kid doeant get overwhelmed.  

&gt;Thanks in advance.

Edit: For all the people downvoting me:

http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/are-greek-world-war-ii-reparations-demands-unfair-a-1023474.html

SPIEGEL: Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has complained that the Germans are being silent and tricky …

Schorkopf: … but he is twisting the context. At the very latest, Greece was required to register claims for reparations at the end of the so-called Two-Plus-Four Treaty negotiations in 1990. In any case, the Greeks did not do so in time. There are good reasons to interpret this silence as acceptance, as a relinquishment of reparations. Yet the more important thought is that there is an obvious reason for the silence.

SPIEGEL: Which is?

Schorkopf: In the past decades, Germany has provided enormous transfer payments, to Greece as well -- not as reparations, but as a part of European integration. We are talking about a figure in the high double-digit billions, a sum that easily reached the level of possible reparations payments. Greece could always count on support. When the country was accepted as a member of the European Community in 1981, it was a tottering candidate. In in 2001, when Greece was admitted into the economic and currency union, people didn't look very closely when the Greeks falsified their accounts.&gt;",null,0,null,1428394182,null,0,1428395678,0,cq3x36d,null,t3_31oc36,null,t1_cq3x36d,null,t1_cq3wnos,null,null,null,1432242716,null,27,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,27,null

They did. The claim that Germany has to pay back the war loan is not new.  
It just gets very confusing because everyone, especially media, mix up actual war reparations with the repayment of a loan that was given bilaterally during war time. 

Greece actually has a valid point if the loan was bilateral agreed upon. But if the loan was not taken by force the conditions are still in place. Which means 0% interest. Which means the loan is worth around 13 billion Euro.

And that's the reason Greece will continue to talk to the press about the hundreds of billions Germany owes, instead of taking the case to an international court. Best case scenario they get 13 billion Euro after a decade of court hearings. Worst case scenario they don't get anything. But in either case they will lose Germanys support, immediately.

I can assure you that this is far from bullshit. My first language is Polish, second English. After reaching fluency in language you actually start thinking in that language. It doesn't require too much effort. However, when I think in English it does not contain any emotional baggage my native tongue would have. That allows me to be more rational when dealing with people and their emotions (I work in tech support).

In regards to your opinion on your national language: stop whining. I will probably never learn your language. It is difficult.

Ho da poco scoperto che si può sostituire il ""launcher"" che in Android dovrebbe corrispondere più o meno a ciò che è il ""Windows Manager"" su Linux. Ho trovato Apex Launcher di cui ti ho già parlato e le prestazioni sono migliorate tantissimo, ora è molto più veloce.

It's not necessarily a conscious decision to not wave flags. After a period full of swastikas, eagles and uniforms it felt just wrong to show many national symbols. That shaped the culture and the minds of future generations. The world cup 2006 was seen as a ""revival"" of German patriotism. A big party together with other nations, celebrating a sports event. That changed the flag culture in regards of sport events (you see more flags), but it didn't change the general flag culture that much.

There's actually a distinct population centered around a site where a cage holding a couple dozen raccoons was destroyed by a bomb during WWII.

SPIEGEL: Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has complained that the Germans are being silent and tricky …

Schorkopf: … but he is twisting the context. At the very latest, Greece was required to register claims for reparations at the end of the so-called Two-Plus-Four Treaty negotiations in 1990. In any case, the Greeks did not do so in time. There are good reasons to interpret this silence as acceptance, as a relinquishment of reparations. Yet the more important thought is that there is an obvious reason for the silence.

SPIEGEL: Which is?

Schorkopf: In the past decades, Germany has provided enormous transfer payments, to Greece as well -- not as reparations, but as a part of European integration. We are talking about a figure in the high double-digit billions, a sum that easily reached the level of possible reparations payments. Greece could always count on support. When the country was accepted as a member of the European Community in 1981, it was a tottering candidate. In in 2001, when Greece was admitted into the economic and currency union, people didn't look very closely when the Greeks falsified their accounts.&gt;

http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/are-greek-world-war-ii-reparations-demands-unfair-a-1023474.html

""SPIEGEL: Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has complained that the Germans are being silent and tricky …

Schorkopf: … but he is twisting the context. At the very latest, Greece was required to register claims for reparations at the end of the so-called Two-Plus-Four Treaty negotiations in 1990. In any case, the Greeks did not do so in time. There are good reasons to interpret this silence as acceptance, as a relinquishment of reparations. Yet the more important thought is that there is an obvious reason for the silence.

SPIEGEL: Which is?

Schorkopf: In the past decades, Germany has provided enormous transfer payments, to Greece as well -- not as reparations, but as a part of European integration. We are talking about a figure in the high double-digit billions, a sum that easily reached the level of possible reparations payments. Greece could always count on support. When the country was accepted as a member of the European Community in 1981, it was a tottering candidate. In in 2001, when Greece was admitted into the economic and currency union, people didn't look very closely when the Greeks falsified their accounts.""



Greece is the one that needs to pay debts. Must be nice trying to run an economy via extortion and blackmail because the own electorate refuses to pay taxes. Tell me please, does Syriza have a plan that actually goes beyond ""let's try and blackmail Germany""?

Redditors are known for ignoring reddiquette. However, using the downvote button to show disapproval of a policy (border controls) may be dickish, but it's not anglophobia.

The comment from the Finn is a bit blunt, not denying that, but that's his opinion and the responses seem to be very different. Some people agree, even Britons, some disagree. It's really all quite civil.

Seriously, I've followed the Scottish independence debate and it wasn't any more vile than this. Hell, just sporting a Bavarian flag like I do in the German subs leads to more... well, not quite abuse, but you get what I mean.

Finally, yes Britain is roughly tied for second largest country in the EU, so people will talk about it. When Britain focusses a lot on freedom of movement, then the rest will talk about it, too.

It is not freedom, except for the rich and corrupt, who can do whatever they want. A policeman with 400-600 euro salary will not risk nor ruin his own life for me, so he won't stand up for what is right. Plus the Militia was not changed, who could teach the new generations? They are the same as the old because it is what they learned. Just this year when I visited I've seen the chef of police from a village slapping a man in the face for no reason. Nothing changed, the Militia is still there.

It is not capitalism, because even if there are laws, nobody (I mean the rich) obeys the law. But those laws are fucked up anyway to help the rich getting richer, not the people.

Still, life is much better than before.

null,false,Rc72,null,null,null,"&gt; Tu ramènes le débat sur le terrain de la morale

Euh, non: ce n'est pas moi, mais ceux qui parlent de ""dette **illégitime**"" qui ramènent le débat sur le terrain de la morale. Je me limite à démonter cette approche soi-disant morale. Je suis par contre bien plus sensible à l'argument utilitariste contre le maintien d'une dette qui ne puisse tout simplement pas être payée en son intégralité, et l'intérêt commun du débiteur et du créancier à en ""oublier"" une partie. C'est par ailleurs ce qui a *déjà* été fait pour la dette grecque.

 &gt; Les intérêts ne sont pas là pour faire joli, ils sont une prime liée au risque pris par le prêteur, qui est tout à fait conscient qu'il risque de ne pas revoir son capital. Plus le risque est élevé, plus la prime l'est aussi.

En effet. Et justement le problème de la Grèce est que le risque qu'on lui attribue est tellement élevé que les intérêts mirobolants qu'elle doit payer grossissent cette dette plus vite qu'elle ne peut la payer. Ce qui à son tour augmente le risque associé à la Grèce. C'est un cercle vicieux que les gouvernement de la zone euro, la BCE et le FMI ont essayé de casser en prêtant à la Grèce à des taux bien inférieurs en échange de compromis dirigés à réduire ce risque de faillite.

&gt; Dans l'hypothèse où l'on ne rembourserait pas les titres liés aux prêts aux Grecs, les banques feraient appel à leurs assurances, qui elles feraient appel à leurs compagnies de réassurance, et ainsi de suite. Le système est largement assez solide pour ne pas entraîner de faillite ni de panique pour quelques dizanes de milliards manquants. Tout au plus le PDG d'AIG n'aura pas son bonus de quelques millions à noël.

C'est une lecture d'une naïveté étourdissante. Tout d'abord, aucun assureur n'est prêt à ""assurer"" la dette grecque, ou alors à un prix absurde, ce qui à son tour fait monter la prime de risque et donc le risque lui-même (voir ci-haut). 

Ensuite, le gros de la dette grecque n'est plus tenu par des banques à capitaux privés, mais par, dans l'ordre, les autres états européens, le FMI et la BCE. Ce qui reste dans des mains privées est surtout dans celles de banques grecques qui se retrouveraient dans des gros, gros problèmes si elles devaient dire adieu à ces actifs.

Par ailleurs, la dette grecque n'est pas simplement une affaire de ""quelques dizaines de milliards"", mais de *centaines* de milliards ([317 milliards d'euros en 2014, pour être exacts](http://www.statista.com/statistics/270409/national-debt-of-greece/)). Or, c'est le même ordre de grandeur que [la faillite de Lehmann Brothers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers), et le système n'a visiblement *pas* été assez solide pour encaisser ça, en partie à cause justement de l'effet de levier des CDO (collateralized debt obligations) censées ""assurer"" la dette. En effet, non seulement les détenteurs de CDOs peuvent acheter de CDOs, mais n'importe qui d'autre. C'est un peu comme si tu pouvais prendre une assurance incendies sur la maison du voisin d'en face. Tu vois le problème...(je me demande par ailleurs si ceux qui répandent des infos alarmistes sur la Grèce n'auraient pas des intérêts particuliers de ce type). La valeur des CDOs émises est devenue des ordres de grandeur supérieure à la dette qu'elles étaient censées ""assurer"".

Dans le cas de Lehmann Brothers, le résultat n'a pas seulement été que le PDG d'AIG ait dû renoncer à son bonus, mais [la boîte toute entière a dû être sauvée aux frais du contribuable américain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_International_Group#Liquidity_crisis_and_government_bailout).

Entre temps, les assureurs ont appris quelque chose. Spécifiquement, ils ont appris à ne pas se brûler les doigts en assurant de la dette à haut risque...

Par contre, en cas de faillite grecque, elle peut produire un autre type d'effet de levier, nommément à travers les répercussions sur les primes de risque d'autres pays européens vulnérables, comme l'Espagne, l'Italie...ou la France. Non seulement les trésors de ces pays seraient directement affectés par une faillite grecque, mais en plus les mêmes spéculateurs qui ont fait flamber la prime de risque grecque se retourneraient désormais, enrichis de milliards, vers ces autres pays.",null,0,null,1428397028,null,0,1428397887,0,cq3xoqs,null,t3_31j594,null,t1_cq3xoqs,null,t1_cq2ucib,null,null,null,1432242998,null,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1,null

Einmal bin ich in einen Konflikt zwischen zwei Fußballvereinen geraten. Fans von beiden Seiten sind in den Zug gestiegen und haben sich wie Katz und Maus durch die Abteile gejagt. Ich saß im Gang gegenüber von der Toilette.

Ich saß mit meinem Kumpel auf diesen Plätzen hinter der Wand als plötzlich die besagten Fans an uns vorbeirannten. Dann kamen die aus dem anderen Lager hinterher und wie aus den nichts flog eine Glasflasche durch das ganze Abteil in Richtung der Fans, aber sie zerschellte am Türrahmen der Toilette.

Germany has tons of leverage, a high-quality diplomatic connection to Russia as well as generally a rather gigantic diplomatic clout. Neither Poland, nor the Baltics, have that.

&gt; which has a historic attachment to Ostpolitik, and think that their methods - which have been proven time and time again to not match reality - are taking the forefront.

Germany isn't appeasing, it's drawing lines in the sand. No, reversal of the Crimea situations isn't a thing you could achieve diplomatically. At least not in the short term. Diplomacy generally can't make any side lose face.

But say we left Poland to do the talking. What are they supposed to do? Suspend government consultations, like Germany did? AFAIK they're not having any with Russia in the first place. Threaten economically? How, by re-igniting the vodka wars?

Russia has nothing to lose when it comes to talking to Poland, thus there's no leverage. Russia would be royally fucked without Germany, which is the reason why Eastern Ukraine isn't part of the Russian Federation.

&gt; No, it's Germany which has a historic attachment to Ostpolitik, and think that their methods

Modern Ostpolitik is not Bismarck's is not Hitler's Ostpolitik. It's the Ostpolitik that brought down the iron curtain.

What are you trying to say, that Germany and Russia are going to divide Poland up between them, again? No, of course, Russia can't be trusted. It has been snubbed in the 00's too often, generally speaking by US hawks who'd rather have a cold war, to continue their therapy. But who said that Germany is trusting Russia.

Take Lithuania and Poland. Our nations were enemies between WWI and WWII. After the second war we didn't have much control of our foreign relations until we gained independence in 1990s. We were cautious at first on how we should go on, but we learned to trust each other.

Relationships with Russia were different: there was a short period during Yeltsin years when we had some *hope* Russia will become democratic and we will be able to forget our old wounds. But the nostalgia of being *the* big evil empire (that it was) took over Russia. This nostalgia is the guiding spirit of that nation now.

We know the horrors that empire can do to the smaller nations. We've seen the [salami tactics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_d_vMKswE) from both ends of the sausage. We know how to separate the 5% of facts from 95% of lies it is saying.

No it's not easier. And loving American culture is not the reason behind the EU.

France could start speaking English I wouldn't care. But it won't happen. And English people will always have an advantage in European  affairs because it's always easier to use your native language than it is to use a language you learnt, no matter the time you put into it.

Suite et fin du petit récit concernant ma (probablement) dernière rencontre avec mon ex et mes adieux à ma chatte hier.

Mon ex est donc passée hier pour récupérer notre chat. Je m'attendais à ce qu'on ait une petite discussion (après tout elle m'a largué par SMS après 5 ans), mais même pas, juste ""OK, cool."" quand elle m'a demandé si mes recherches avançaient niveau taff pour combler le silence.

Au moment de lui amener la chatte, celle-ci s'est mise en boule et a commencé à trembler de peur ; c'était horrible, comme si je la donnais à une inconnue, alors que c'était (marrez-vous, jeunes voyous !) fusionnel avec mon chat. Le dernier moment passé avec elle ce sera moi qui l'arrache de sous le canapé pour l'enfermer dans sa boîte de transport.

Sur ce, mon ex s'en est allée, notre chat sous le bras, sans même un ""coucou"" vers mes neveux/nièces qui étaient là pour Pâques et qui l'adorent.

J'ai appris quelques heures plus tard (*disclaimer* : non, je ne fais pas d'espionnage creepy) qu'il était officiel depuis peu qu'elle et le mec qui lui avait fortement conseillé de me larguer (conseil d'ami, bien entendu) étaient ensemble, amoureux et heureux. Ils se présentent même à leurs parents respectifs sous peu.

Apparemment elle ferait des blagues sur le fait que j'aie du mal à tourner la page, et ça la ferait sourire de savoir que j'envisageais de repartir à l'étranger pour débuter autre chose, alors que franchement c'est plus une fuite en avant de ma part qu'un départ vers l'aventure, et j'aurais préféré enfin pouvoir me poser.

Je m'attendais à ce qu'elle se soit remise avec quelqu'un -c'est une très jolie et intelligente jeune femme-, mais là c'est vraiment dur. Si rapidement, et avec un type genre ""player"" (pas du tout le genre de mon ex), je le vis moyennement bien même si je sais que tout cela ne me regarde plus.

(...) In August 2006, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that, in March 2006, Bachmann was on a Minneapolis radio show advocating for a state constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. A caller asked her to explain how he, a heterosexual, would be harmed if his gay neighbors were allowed to marry. Bachmann replied by saying: ""Public schools would have to teach that homosexuality and same-sex marriage are normal, natural and that maybe children should try them.""

None of the major parties are opposed to EU membership, and he didn't even give the UK a referendum on the Lisbon treaty, when other countries like Ireland did.

&gt;Bereits auf der ersten Konferenz der von Deutschland ehemals besetzten Staaten und der westlichen Kriegsgegner des Dritten Reiches in Paris im November und Dezember 1945 hatte die damalige Athener Übergangsregierung eine Summe von zehn Milliarden Dollar verlangt. Also gleich die Hälfte der von der Sowjetunion insgesamt vorgeschlagenen Reparationssumme von 20 Milliarden.

Allerdings ist sowohl die historische Logik dieser Forderung als auch ihre völkerrechtliche Gültigkeit  zweifelhaft. 

U.a., weil Griechenland bereits in der Vergangenheit zweimal Entschädigungen erhalten hat. [Details siehe hier](http://www.welt.de/geschichte/zweiter-weltkrieg/article137307233/Athens-Forderungen-stehen-auf-toenernen-Fuessen.html).

&gt;Richter, der einzige deutsche Experte für neuere griechische Geschichte, weist allerdings auch auf den wenig bekannten Umstand hin, dass von jenen Reparationen, die Deutschland nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg leistete, kaum etwas je in Griechenland ankam. Nach der Pariser Konferenz musste Deutschland 1950 Drehbänke, Fräsmaschinen und andere Produktionsgüter im Wert von 120 Millionen Mark an Griechenland liefern.

&gt;Ein Drittel davon wurde verschifft, kam nach den Recherchen von Richter jedoch nie an. „Zwei Drittel davon wurden unter griechischer Aufsicht im Hafen von Hamburg zwei Jahre lang so gelagert, dass die Ware nur noch als Schrott nach Großbritannien verkauft werden konnte“, sagt Richter. „Wären diese Güter angekommen, dann wäre Griechenland heute ein Industriestaat.“

that way the dealer was not officially associated with the coffeeshop/bar, he was just a random patron, and the dealer also didn't have a lot of weed directly on him, so if he would be busted he could deny that the weed was his.

this evolved into the current situation, as long as weed is sold in a coffeeshop with a license and the coffeeshop obeys the rules(not more than 500 grams suply present in the building, no minors, no advertising, etc) the ban on weed is not enforced. sometimes there is a little confusion about the rules though, for example when a coffeeshop decides to hand out/sell lighters with a logo from the coffeeshop, is it advertising?

Zur Erklärung, warum im 2. Beispiel ""nicht zu"" am Ende steht:

*zustimmen* wird konjugiert als *stimme/stimmst/stimmt/stimmen ... zu*, die Präposition *zu* steht am Ende. Bei der Verneinung wird das *nicht* vor der Präposition, aber nach dem Objekt platziert, also *""Ich stimme ... nicht zu""*. 

Das Objekt ist in diesem Fall *""das, was er gesagt hat""*. Da es im Dativ steht, bekommen wir *""dem, was er gesagt hat""*. Wenn wir das in unsere Konstruktion einsetzen, bekommen wir:

&gt; En France, le maire est généralement un vieil homme blanc. Il s'appelle le plus souvent Michel ou Alain. Et bien que Kofi Yamgnane ait su se distinguer pendant douze ans à Saint-Coulitz ou qu'Azzédine Taïbi ait été élu en 2014, à Stains, la photo de famille des chefs de file des conseils municipaux reste largement monochrome. Elle est aussi très masculine.

&gt;La loi a permis d'atteindre la quasi parité dans les conseils municipaux des communes de plus de 1000 habitants, mais les femmes ne représentent encore aujourd'hui que 16% des maires. Enfin, peu de jeunes répondent à l'appel. 3,8% des maires élus en 2014 ont moins de 40 ans, 49,7% plus de 60. La proportion de retraités (42,6%) ne cesse de croître. Le mandat réclame en effet de plus en plus d'expertise et de disponibilité. L'indemnité ne permet pas d'en vivre. 

Tout cela ne me dit pas quelle est la proportion selon la couleur de peau et comment arriver à un niveau acceptable de *coloration* de la population des élus. Ni si des ""non-Blancs"" ne peuvent s'appeler Michel ou Alain. /troll 

Sérieusement, comment on peut laisser passer ce genre de titres ? Ils auraient dû ajouter ""hétérosexuels"" afin de compléter le portrait caricatural. Et commencer à proposer des statistiques fondées sur la couleur de peau et la sexualité.

C'est un peu le problème de ce genre de débats ; si tu commences à dire qu'il y a trop de ""Blancs"", tu te retrouves à devoir estimer que la couleur de peau est un facteur pertinent pour amener des gens à un poste donné (cela sous-entend : ""trop de Blancs, pas assez de Noirs/ce que tu veux"").

You would have paid a lot more upfront. You do realise that it has cost you almost nothing so far, right? If Greece defaulted

Hahaha, that's rich. Poor Germans, so much bullying, how can they live through it all? Maybe you should put yourselves in a Greek person's shoes and get some perspective if you think the ""moral blackmail"" and ""insults"" Germany is getting are bad. 

But if you hate all this tension so much, you could have allowed Greece to default within the Eurozone from the get go, give a few small loans to Greece for a couple of years and everyone would be happy then. Instead you gave them huge loans because your country didn't want to pay for the default and now everyone is worse off. Whose fault is that? There were options that would make everyone happy and would not result in all this misery. Your country ignored them because they tried to be cheap and maximise their gain for the short-term.

However, he writes in French and obviously people that don't read French are thus not able to access his pearls of wisdom and this really restricts his audience. Also, I think he is a bit too obsessed about the language issue.

In general terms, with languages France has reaped what it sewed. France accepted pragmatism and practicality for the choice of working languages for the EU Commission on the basis that French was one of the three languages. This immediately resulted in EU language hierarchy, with other EU official languages being subordinated to English, French and German. However, once we admit that we should choose languages based on practicality and accept a hierarchy, it was always going to be the case that English would eventually dominate over French.

However, I have to say that multi-lingualism in the EU is not finished yet. I recently had a job interview for an EU entity and being a native English language speaker they insisted that half the interview was done in another language. I asked if I could do it in Italian, but unfortunately there were no Italian speakers available, so I had to do French. Annoyingly there also weren't any native French speakers available so I had to be interviewed in French by a Dutch guy: his French wasn't great and nor is mine when it comes to technical language! It felt kind of ridiculous, being interviewed in French by a Dutch guy when neither of us spoke fluent French, when the other people in the interview, a Latvian, an Irish and a German couldn't speak any French at all. I guess we still sometimes are promoting multi-lingualism over efficiency!

Of course English is hard to master, but it doesn't kick you in the face those first vital years. But I digress.

If English people would always had an advantage in European affairs we wouldn't have seen what happened last year with Cameron throwing a tantrum because Juncker got elected president of the Commission. And here in /r/Europe you can see Brits and Irish redditors losing arguments to non-native speaks (and viceversa!) all the time!

I also question the argument that Poland and the Baltics are somehow more. Their attitude towards Russia is usually counter-productive and a result of national traumas from the past, rather than realpolitik which is absolutely necessary in the international relations.

The *only* way to deal with Russia is the (current) German way. Burning all the bridges and isolating Russia will only create problems like the present one exponentially in the long run and I'm not even going to comment on any sort of a military solution proposal. With no conceivable alternative to a diplomatic and integrative approach, however many times it failed in the past, the only thing left to do is keep trying again and again and again until it doesn't.

Ceci dit, quand j'entend aujourd'hui parler de ""retour de la Croissance"", je me dis qu'on a réussi à faire vivre deux générations sur un mythe, ce qui en soi est merveilleux, mais c'est une autre histoire. Bref, en 1978 la télévision (trois chaînes !) et la radio Françaises étaient intégralement controlée par l'État et [ceci est une analyse particulièrement fine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vVaWFw54ig) du niveau de discours adressé audit 'téléspectateur type', lequel avait par ailleurs accès à  une presse écrite d'une qualité et d'une diversité bien supérieure à ce que nous connaissons aujourd'hui, et [presque libre](http://www.nrblog.fr/casedepart/2012/05/31/case-depart-raconte-angouleme-1979-la-censure-fait-debat/). En définitive, ce que le téléspectateur attendait du progrès, c'était surtout de pouvoir enfin acheter un poste en couleurs ([à crédit, bien sûr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BFwLHIFiVs)). C'était aussi l'époque où les Anglais élisaient [Thatcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQ6SjnPIomI) et les Français Mitterrand. Irréconciliables. Il faudrait creuser davantage.

Je n'avais jamais entendu parler du CLODO. Belle trouvaille, anecdotique cependant. Ce que je trouve en ligne laisse surtout apparaître un disours automatique de gauchiste moyen sans innovation conceptuelle, sans réflexion quant aux bouleversement sociaux et économiques en cours ou  à venir. J'aime bien la formule ""Ainsi espère-t-on transformer les valeurs du système en système de valeurs"" mais je n'ai pas trouvé l'argumentation logique aboutissant à cette conclusion.

Mandarin is not the most spoken language as it is just the theoretical standard and what people actually speak in China widely differs, even if they use Mandarin as their written language.

Even ignoring that, if you have business in foreign countries then English is the most widely spread language that will help you. Chinese peasants are with a lot, but they don't speak Mandarin, and aren't very relevant for business and politics anyway.

&gt;

&gt;The __mullets__ or __grey mullets__ are a [family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology\)) (__Mugilidae__) and [order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology\)) of [ray-finned fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray-finned_fish) found worldwide in coastal temperate and tropical waters, and in some species in fresh water.  Mullets have served as an important source of food in Mediterranean Europe since [Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire) times. The family includes about 80 species in 17 genera, although half of the species are in just two genera (*Liza* and *Mugil*).

&gt;Mullets are distinguished by the presence of two separate [dorsal fins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_fin), small triangular mouths, and the absence of a [lateral line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_line) organ. They feed on [detritus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detritus), and most species have unusually muscular stomachs and a complex [pharynx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharynx) to help in digestion.

null,false,Ermgotthis,ZZZZZZhippocampe,Hippocampe,null,"Premier point : si ton ex a l'air d'aussi bien prendre la rupture, c'est qu'elle n'a pas le manque émotionnel que tu subis, puisqu'elle a un mec. Attends voir qu'il la trompe / la quitte, et tu verra dans quel état est son deuil. Honnêtement, sur le long terme, tu es dans la position la plus enviable : il est sain de prendre du temps seul après une relation longue pour se retrouver. Sache donc qu'elle est incapable de vivre seule, et qu'à terme, la plus malheureuse, ça sera elle.

Second point : l'apparent détachement de ton ex lorsqu'elle est venu chercher le chat, ce côté froid est très probablement une ""armure"" qu'elle utilise pour cacher ses émotions et soutenir ses ""moqueries"". Au final, elle se ment plus à elle-même qu'autre chose.

Troisième point : au final, ce qu'elle pense, ce qu'elle ressent, ce n'est pas ton problème. Ignore-le consciement. Décide de ne pas être impacté par ça et de tracer ta route lorsque ce genre de pensées pointe son nez. Ce n'est pas à toi de veiller aux sentiments, positifs ou négatifs de ton ex. Occupe-toi des tiens.

Quatrième point : Le départ à l'étranger, c'est une fuite en avant. J'ai eu le même réflexe que toi, mais mes démarches n'ont pas aboutis. Au final, c'est plutôt positif, parce que si tu fuis les lieux des souvenirs, tu fuis aussi tes amis et tu t'isole. Et crois moi, l'isolement est pire que les souvenirs : mieux vaut faire face à ceux-ci au plus tôt et les accepter. Comme ça quand tu décollera à l'aventure, t'en profitera vraiment parce que tu partira *pour toi* et pas *pour la fuir*. Mais ça tu l'avais déjà compris, de ce que je lis ;)

Cinquième point : 
&gt; -c'est une très jolie et intelligente jeune femme-

J'en suis persuadé. Sauf que y'en a des bien plus jolies et des biens plus intelligentes, t'inquiète pas pour ça. Dans 1 an, tu te retournera et tu te diras ""ouais, non, j'ai carrément trouvé mieux"". La preuve : elle est tombée pour un ""player""... Si futée que ça, la gamine ? /:)

Sixième point : rien du tout. Mec t'as l'air de prendre les choses assez posément, n'hésite pas à gueuler de temps en temps auprès de tes potes pour relâcher la pression. C'est chiant, c'est dur, mais ça fait du bien de gueuler, et au bout d'un moment, ça passe.

So I'm not gay about McDonald's (neither am I anal about fast food), but I did a quick google search on this sandwich. I ended up on some random American blog, the dude went to Budapest on a business trip afaik, and he had one.

He commented something like, ""McFarm is like Ohio. Even Hungary is like Ohio.""

Evita di essere pedante e di inserire sezioni solo per riempire gli spazi bianchi e fai in modo che sia una lettura piacevole anche se, diciamocelo, non la leggerà quasi nessuno. Personalmente io ho presentato un lavoro sulla rete sviluppando alcune idee da un tema fatto in classe e aggiungendo tematiche che mettevano a confronto l'utente medio di internet con alcuni grandi personaggi e filosofi del passato... Tutto sommato in dieci minuti ho fatto la mia bella figura e ho strappato non poche risate alla commissione e al pubblico.

- 150g d'épinards surgelés  
-  50g de parmesan  
- 3 càs de pignons de pin  
- 3-4 branches de basilic  
- une pincée de mélange d'herbes italiennes  
- 250g de ricotta  
- 60g de beurre + pour beurrer  
- 20cl de lait  
- 2 oeufs moyens  
- 280g de farine  
- 3 càc de levure chimique  
- 2 càs de sucre  
- 0,5 càc de sel


1. Décongeler et bien égoutter les épinards. Râper le parmesan (n'achète jamais de parmesan râpé, malheureux !). Faire griller les pignons à la poêle, sans huile. Hacher le basilic.

2. Chauffer le four à 190°C. Beurrer 12 moules à muffin. Faire fondre 60g de beurre. Battre le beurre chaud, le lait, les oeufs, au fouet. Dans un autre bol, mélanger farine, levure, sucre et sel. Avec une spatule, incorporer le liquide dans le mélange farine etc., arrêter dès que la liaison est faite.

3. Incorporer les épinards, les pignons de pin, la ricotta et les herbes avec précaution. Ne pas trop mélanger ! Répartir dans les formes, saupoudrer de parmesan, enfourner 18 minutes. Tester la cuisson avec un pique en bois, il doit ressortir sans que la pâte colle. Laisser refroidir 10 minutes avant de sortir des moules.

null,false,pasunthrowaway,FRAN,France,null,"&gt; Yes, I just used your logic where you found out that English is lingua franca in EU because of USA influence and not because the number of speakers (as consequence of USA influence - just like the Crown influenced citizens of USA).
&gt; Btw, several hundred thousands of French speakers were expelled from France (as they were members of different religion) in the time when France had huge territory in North America. If they were allowed to settle there, all the world would be speak French today. But, arrogance and chauvinism of French elites didn't allow them that (even if they thought of North America as totally worthless land at that time), so England accepted those fugitives and assimilated them through the time.


French/German/English are very close when it comes to native speakers

I really don't see why you're speaking about 18th century history. But you're also wrong here. French people were encouraged to emigrate in New France. They just didn't because it was poor as fuck. The King and his ministers would have loved to see more colonists going there, but it did not happen. The Philosophes were the one who thought it was worthless. The thing is, it was, compared to the sugar islands.  They tried to invest in Louisiana in the early 18th and France got bankrupted. 

Your part on ""we would be speak French today"" is not very intelligent. Nobody knows what would happen, and France could only take a decision based on the availaible information at that time.  

Also, the French speakers in New France were not fugitives.

Una discussione su una misteriosa religione è molto meno appetibile di una sul cibo, in cui tutti sanno tutto.

Which is true for every language you pick. To get around such advantages, every EU citizen should learn English starting from the first grade and English should be an official language in every EU country (all services should be available in English by law). Combine that with the fact that English is the language of the vast majority of media and the Internet and around us everywhere, and any unfair advantages quickly go away. Personally I'm not a native English speaker, but there's no way anyone has an advantage over me because of that, and I started learning it in the 3rd grade.

To restore Russia to what he thinks is its rightful place. We are the ones that have to deal with their delusions of grandeur.  

Like you said in your previous post:
&gt;Russia has nothing to lose when it comes to talking to Poland, thus there's no leverage. *Russia would be royally fucked without Germany,* which is the reason why Eastern Ukraine isn't part of the Russian Federation.

Russia would be royally fucked without the EU, and that is exactly what I think we should do.

I know that this is unlikely since we are depended on their gas but we should at least be working our asses of to get rid of that addiction.

So we must make sure that there will be no profit. Make them pay for what they are doing by using our economic powers.

Après, son côté froid, je suis pas certain qu'il soit simulé ou que ça soit une armure, elle est juste en lune de miel avec son Jules et du coup j'ai disparu de l'image, ce qui n'est pas complètement anormal, mais c'est vrai que je pensais comme toi au début. Sa meilleure amie a démenti. Elle s'en fout, juste. Maintenant à moi de m'en foutre aussi.

Ton quatrième point reflète parfaitement mes craintes ; la seule différence c'est que j'ai déjà une bonne poignée d'amis d'enfance sur place, et que l'isolement, pour l'instant, c'est plutôt ici. Ceci dit j'aurai un an dès l'obtention du visa pour le valider, donc d'ici là j'espère pouvoir partir ""pour moi"", comme tu le dis très bien...

To get around such advantages, every EU citizen should learn English starting from the first grade and English should be an official language in every EU country (all services should be available in English by law). Combine that with the fact that English is the language of the vast majority of media and the Internet and around us everywhere, and any unfair advantages quickly go away. Personally I'm not a native English speaker, but there's no way anyone has an advantage over me because of that, and I started learning it in the 3rd grade.

Even then, English teaching is uniform (for exemple, it's complete and utter shit in France). And that's not doable, Europe doesn't exist to change the national cultures, but to create a synthesis of them, without replacing them.

Who is the figurehead of Europe's relationship with Russia? Not Cameron. Not Donald Tusk. Not Carl Bildt. No, it is Merkel that is at all the peace conferences, whose opinion everyone cares about (albeit, with a somewhat befuddled looking Hollande at her side). For better or worse, Merkel (and behind her, Germany) are the ones that are leading diplomatic relations with Russia. I singled Germany out for that reason.

&gt;poles and baltics stating that russia can't ever be trusted may have its roots in their history and be understandable, but taking this as advice that would need to be followed 100% will never succeed (and is a bit bigoted, just saying...). you can not and should not antagonise russia and hope they will all of the sudden turn into a free and democratic human rights respecting reliable trading partner for the west.

I think that the Poles and Balts simply understand Russia better than Germany ever could. They don't have the idea that Russia could *never* be trusted, but they're cognizant of the circumstances in which they should. And when a strongman is in power is probably the last possible time when they should be. Poland for example has had some shitty relations with both Ukraine and Lithuania over the last hundred years, yet based on the situation within the country (this applies more to Ukraine) they knew when to help, and when they should be fearful. 

It's telling in some of the responses to my comment, that many people still have a Chirac style view of the former East - that they should know when to shut up. Predictions of headstrong and belligerent eastern nations holding on to national grudges as the means for dealing with international matters is a throwback to the 1920s, yet these are the standards to which many are viewed in by the West. As soon as Germany's Russia policy is criticized, these images are always put forward, but do you really think that Latvia, or Lithuania, or Poland would have such a policy? More likely, it would be a cautious and distrusting style - as the situation demands, and an understanding that there simply is no fair dealing with a despot like Putin. Wait for the next leader to come in, see if they can deal with them instead.

&gt;hindsight is proving them wrong right now but looking back a few years germany's approach was not as stupid as you seem to think it was. while people like schröder has gone near ludicrous in hyping russia and it's administration the approach of getting russia involved in europe through diplomacy, economy, educational exchanges etc. was promising and it also seemed to work for quite a while.

I disagree. Whoever was advising leaders about Russia back in '03-'11 should be fired. Ostpolitik may have worked back under the Soviet Union, but things are completely different now, namely that Russia is ruled by diktat, rather than by committee. For Ostpolitik to work (essentially bring Russia under European norms via repeated and constant collaboration), there needs to be structure, institutions in place, not just the whims of one man.

&gt;i'm going to attribute it to the late hour and a few drinks you may have had, but attributing eastern european hostility towards russia to proper judgement while at the same time disregarding ""ostpolitik"" as failing time and time again couldn't be more one sided if you tried. the ever failing ostpolitik was essential for reunification. it was essential for noramalising the relations between russia and germany. it was absolutely essential to normalise the relations between germany and poland as well. claiming that ostpolitik always failed when its historic accomplishments are pretty much undeniable is quite a stretch.

I wasn't claiming that Ostpolitik had always failed, I was claiming that they were applying the same system to a different model and hoping it would work.",null,0,null,1428404768,null,0,false,0,cq3zd1c,null,t3_31o20h,null,t1_cq3zd1c,null,t1_cq3n7hq,null,null,null,1432243787,null,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8,null

&gt;...Your part on ""we would be speak French today"" is not very intelligent. Nobody knows what would happen, and France could only take a decision based on the availaible information at that time.  

You can't argue of my intelligence on this, cause I followed some logic that you cannot disprove as non-intelligent, you only may argue it's just a speculation - not the intelligence related issue.

The only reason why Americans speak English is the English speakers base when massive immigrations were developing.

If there was the French speakers base of **several hundred thousands people** that would be **more then enough to outnumber** any other speakers, and so the base would be built on French language.

&gt;Also, the French speakers in New France were not fugitives. And if genocide (see the Acadians) is a way of assimilating people, welle that's you're opinion (I'm trolling here, ne need to answer to that we'll save time.)

&gt;Since it is the prime minister that set up the committee and the deputy finance minister making those claims it seems genuine and serious and not just a couple of backbenchers looking for a topic to grandstand on.

Yes, it appears to be government policy to bring those things up.

&gt;They sure understand that Germany won't pay them 279 billion euros, not even a fraction of that.

Yes. The chances of Germany paying the 279 billion are pretty much the same as Greece paying its 320 billion euro debt. Can you see a pattern? It's all politics. Those numbers are so big that they are pretty much meaningless.

&gt;They surely understand that stances like those are devoured by the tabloid press and will make it so much harder for German politicians to make concession?

Uhm. I can't remember German politicians making any concessions while the previous government did everything it could to *not* bring up issues like this. For the average Greek this does not make any difference.

&gt;Why do they spend so much time and effort vilifying Germany?

Because a lot of people (me included) actually do believe that Germany is acting in an evil way (for various reasons).

&gt;Would they like to negotiate bailouts with Finland, a Nation with a much harder stance?

That is a purely theoretical question (it will never happen) because at this point Germany = Europe as far as negotiations go.

&gt;I would think that they understand that the European project is in part paying reparations in many different forms to help develop less fortunate nations?

Greeks being on the receiving end of those ""reparations"" (commonly called support or stability packages) know that this is *not* the case. Those packages existed to shape the European economy i.e. the fact that the EU spend money in Greece did not mean that other countries did not benefit from it. They were more investments than anything else.

&gt;What's the point? Surely the Greek electorate knows all that as well. How do the Greek people feel about this?

This is what Greeks (who voted for the current government, not me) feel about this:

At the beginning of the crisis, the troika *actively* stepped in and offered a solution in the form of a bailout. It was understood (in retrospect, from how the current government is being treated by the troika but also back then, from for example how Papandreou's proposal for a referendum was received by the other European leaders) that we either had to keep 100% in line or we would not be bailed out. The line was austerity and ""the banks first"" (mainly because French and German banks were exposed to Greek bonds and a default could throw the European banking sector out of balance), something which pretty much everyone now (either silently or publicly) acknowledges did not work (for Greece, the banks did just fine), like, *at all*. Greece followed the line by voting in two pro-troika governments during the 2009-2015 period. 2015-2009 = six years. Greeks think that any bad effects from a bailout would probably not last longer than six years and that even if the low was lower that what was experienced during those six years (which was really really low) they at least now would have started to recover (which is in no way happening now, look at the unemployment numbers). To cut a long story short: Greece went through a six year long tunnel and the only thing that it has to show for it are the bank bailouts. Lowering wages did not bring investors and cutting down the public sector did not create surpluses. So, Greeks do not see Germany as a partner that is there to help anymore, but as a country that just follows its own agenda. That means that everything is fair game now. Germany throws at us everything it has to better its position so we might as well do the same thing. Things stopped being ""ethical"" and ""fair"" a long long time ago.

For the other points: the EU was pushed by many people, who had different interests, and a substantial, non-negligible number of people worked to have a less unbalanced/less dependant european-american relationship. The French-german partnership, which was, and still is the cornerstone of the EU, is a good exemple of that.

Ah no, but seriously.

Edited because now I've had coffee and i can write coherently:

We're back in a tech boom and there's mad demand for experianced and able engineers and developers. Wages at the upper levels in Ireland didn't get nearly as stripped back to reality by the recession so for what an employer gets, this is an expensive place to hire expensive people. Particularly for the big ones like google and facebook, there's just no need to be running their more expensive divisions in Ireland. I'm pretty sure the vast majority of what those two do here is ad sales and support. They're not here for some mad nexus of engineers or developers we don't have, they're here for access to the EU labour market and the tax system.

For another example, have a look [at who airbnb are looking for](https://www.airbnb.ie/careers/locations/) which shows where they need people for what- customer service in Dublin, operations in Berlin, marketing everywhere but the only place they want engineers or developers is San Francisco.

It's like when they started with the FDI stuff. Bourne's used to make chips in Cork, but what that ended up meaning was an American company wanted a giant facility built for them and then locals with or without a third level qualification could work on an assembly line which would have been recognisable to someone in the Midlands in England 100 years earlier, except this time in a clean room.",null,0,null,1428407727,null,0,1428409739,0,cq40749,null,t3_31ay0b,null,t1_cq40749,null,t1_cq3zey1,null,null,null,1432244181,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

if you want to move the car first, before registering it, you need a so called ""kurzzulassung"" which is valid for 5 days. those are the plates with the yellow stripe.  
first you or your friend need to go to an insurance for a ""versicherungskärtchen"" (a piece of paper that tells the kfz-office that the car will be insured). most give it out for free, when the car is later insured there when it's fully registered, otherwise you have to pay for it (don't know the exact amount). so it would be a good idea to go to the insurance company your friend is planning on using.  
with the ""versicherungskärtchen"" you go to the kfz-office and register the car for 5 days (you might need some information on the car, so bring a copy of the papers). they'll give you your license number and you can go to a plate-maker of your choice to have the license plates made.  
not sure how TÜV is handled, but afaik you don't need a certificate, but have to sign a paper stating that the car is street legal.

After WW1 English was basically on par with French and it took WW2, the Marshall Plan, American dominance, globalization (process mostly driven by the US) and the creation of the commercial Internet by US companies for English to take off.

Anyone who was alive during the last five years should have realized that economic data coming from Greece is not to be trusted. Todays european governments would surely not repeat the mistake of letting Greece into the EZ without having an independent, trustworthy auditor have a very close look at their books.

And we gave Greece lots of time to collect taxes, they seem more than unwilling to do so. Which is understandable from their point of view, because it's much preferable for them to try and extort tax paying citizens of other EU countries first.

http://www.wsj.com/articles/greece-struggles-to-get-citizens-to-pay-their-taxes-1424867495 :

&gt; At the end of 2014, Greeks owed their government about €76 billion ($86 billion) in unpaid taxes accrued over decades, though mostly since 2009. The government says most of that has been lost to insolvency and only €9 billion can be recovered.

Instantly claiming that 90% of the taxes the greek tax payers owe the greek state can't be collected and instead having the nerve to come begging to the other EZ states makes my blood boil. That's thievery, there is no other word for it.

&gt; Shock:
Catastrophic 
climate change
If advances in energy technology are 
insufficient to ensure the required 
amounts of electricity for economic 
growth, **countries could burn 
hydrocarbons at ever-higher rates.**  This 
may increase greenhouse gas levels, 
causing global temperature rise.  In turn, 
this could lead to long heat waves in 
normally temperate latitudes.  Sustained 
drought could contribute to repeated 
harvest failures, as arable crops would 
be unable to cope with the high 
temperatures.  Severe food shortages 
could lead to sudden mass migration 
of populations across national borders, 
triggering **widespread social unrest.** (page 32)

I'm saying we're allready seeing this widespread social unrest in Africa where climate change has been a contributing factor. There's no sign it will get any better in the immediate future.

&gt; In sub-Saharan 
Africa alone, some 60 million people are 
expected to move from ‘desertified’ areas to 
northern Africa and Europe by 2020, and this 
figure is highly likely to increase out to 2045. (page 34)

We're already building higher walls and fences to keep them out. The problem is only going to get worse. 

&gt; **The financial requirements for humanitarian 
assistance are projected to increase by up to 
1,600% over the next 20 years, in large part 
due to the effects of climate change.**
By 2045, this figure is likely to be substantially 
higher.  Funds available for disaster 
preparedness and relief are widely assessed to 
be inadequate.  As the incidence and impact 
of natural disasters increase, this situation is 
likely to worsen.  Governments, particularly 
those in the regions most affected, are likely to 
become increasingly focussed on: preventing, 
preparing for (and dealing with) the impact of 
environmental and climate related disasters 
at home; and with providing humanitarian 
assistance and disaster relief abroad.  Some 
governments are likely to require their armed 
forces to take on an increased role in disaster 
relief.  (page 38)

Does the EU have sufficient capabilities to respond to natural disasters? I'm not sure we do. We need to set some sort of Natural Disaster Relief Group or whatever. When the typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines in 2013 the American military was quick to respond. The EU needs to do the same.

&gt; Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is likely 
to be the most important means by which 
climate change is managed – **although out 
to 2045 it appears likely that the drivers of 
greenhouse gases will continue to increase.**  
Inertia in the climate system means that 
warming would continue even if emissions 
were cut to zero tomorrow. (page 38)

Il problema e' esattamente quello: gli incentivi eccessivamente generosi hanno portato a fare delle valutazioni economiche iniziali di un certo tipo.

E non ti sto parlando di frodi.

Se oggi dessero un incentivo all'80% per il finanziamento a 5 anni di una Tesla ovvio che anche il lavapiatti della Carra' corre a prendersela. Se dopo 1 anno smetti l'incentivo lo costringi a pagarsela da solo o a fargliela vendere (mercato inondato da Tesla mezze pagate).

Nel caso del fotovoltaico e' peggio perché non e' un prodotto finito come una Tesla e il mercato e' stato inondato da impianti non finiti che nessuno voleva (vuole) comprare.

Il ministero sara anche libero di fare quello che gli pare ma mi pare evidente l'incapacità di valutare le conseguenze delle iniziative. Un distaccamento totale dalla realtà economica.

About Europe:
&gt; Climate
Temperatures will almost certainly increase 
across the region, with a rise in extreme 
weather events such as the 2003 heatwave 
(which caused over 35,000 deaths).  Rainfall 
patterns will probably change, with 
northern Europe becoming wetter in winter 
and Mediterranean regions becoming 
significantly drier, particularly in summer 
months.  Droughts are likely to increase 
in number, particularly in the central and 
southern regions.  Rising sea levels could have 
significant impacts for several major low-lying 
cities particularly in the Netherlands. (page 119)

Today's extremes will become the new norm.

&gt; Agriculture and fisheries
The climatic effect on agriculture will 
probably have a significant impact on future 
yields.  Significant decreases in yields in the 
southern regions are expected due to water 
shortages and increasing temperatures, with 
small decreases in the central regions, and 
increases in the north.  Europe is likely to 
remain self-sufficient for arable and livestock 
production, although many European people 
may be concerned about food security.  
Technological advancements, such as more 
efficient desalinisation plants, are likely to 
mitigate water shortages in the Mediterranean 
area, and genetically modified crops are likely 
to become increasingly widespread (despite 
opposition from environmentalists), allowing 
continued production as temperatures rise 
and rainfall patterns change.  Warming of the 
oceans, due to climate change, may affect fish 
migration and could lead to the collapse of 
some fisheries in European waters.  There may 
also be tension over fishing rights, particularly 
in the north Atlantic, as non-European fishing 
fleets seek to operate in the area. (page 119-120)

It's a known fact that, when temperature goes up 1C after a certain optimal point, yields go down 10 per cent. Possible droughts don't help either.

&gt; Shock:
Rise of a European power
If a European country financially 
out-performed the rest of the EU to a 
significant extent, domestic political 
concerns could prompt the country’s 
leaders to use its leverage to dominate 
Europe not only economically but also 
politically, severely challenging the EU’s 
cohesion.  In such a situation, Europe 
could split between those countries 
who are dependent on the large power 
and those who resent its influence.  
There is a risk that NATO could become 
less effective, as European countries 
may place loyalty or opposition to 
the economic power above any other 
alliances.

This is talking about Germoney. Russia realises this. There's a reason why they want talk with Merkel and not other EU-leaders. They want to create a division inside the EU by doing so.

This way, British kids will be learning at least one European language between the ages 5-16. 

**but** I'm not optimistic that such measures, if implemented will fully fix the monolingualism of the British. Indeed the problem is lack of need or motivation to learn a foreign language if you're a native English speaker. Perhaps the main reason why foreign language instruction in the UK is poor is because there is no exposure to the target language outside of the classroom, and there's not much you can do about that. All your entertainment needs are met with UK and American media and the main language of international business, science and tourism is English. Learning a language takes a lot of effort, and the reason why most people learn a new language is for some sort of personal gain. For a native English speaker, there is not much to gain from learning a foreign language when nearly all of of your needs and wants are all attainable in English.

During his conquest and rule of Ireland 41% of the population of Ireland was killed, that is estimated to be around 618,000+ people. He forced everyone in Ireland to convert to Protestantism, move to Connacht (a sparsely populated province in the west of Ireland) or die. Most of those killed were civilians, entire villages where massacred.

To this day he is hated in Ireland, Several years ago the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Bertie Ahern visited London and the following happened:

&gt; In 1997, shortly after the Labour Party’s victory in the British general election, the newly appointed foreign secretary, Robin Cook, received a courtesy visit from Bertie Ahern. The taoiseach entered Cook’s office but immediately walked out again on seeing a painting of Oliver Cromwell in the room. He refused to return until somebody removed the picture of *‘that murdering bastard’*. Anxious to avoid a diplomatic incident, Cook made the necessary arrangements. The comedian and author Stephen Fry related this story at the launch of the Heritage Sector’s ‘History Matters’ campaign in 2006, and commented that ‘it was a bit like hanging a portrait of Eichmann before the visit of the Israeli prime minister’.

Of course if you frame it like that it sounds like what a 5 year old can understand. The fact that your reality is simple enough for a 5 year old to understand is not something to be proud of.

The conditions are unreasonable because if Greece was given better conditions to start with (e.g. immediate debt relief) then it would cost *less* to the European taxpayer. I can't think of any definition of reasonable that this fact fits into.

The second point I wanted to refute is that Greece *has* asked multiple times about the reparations from 1960 and onwards.

I am **not** debating if the reparations are justified, lawful or otherwise. I am **not** saying it's a smart move, I am **not** saying it's the correct thing to do.

What I am saying though is that your points were wrong.

1. Greece did take part in WWII with the Allies and the peace treaty did involve them.

2. Greece has repeatedly asked for reparations since then.

&gt; ""I have killed men and women, old and young, who lived at Oblucitza and Novoselo, where the Danube flows into the sea, up to Rahova, which is located near Chilia, from the lower Danube up to such places as Samovit and Ghighen.

Most of these victims were Turks and Muslim Bulgarians, so he is still considered some kind of a folk hero in Romania.

However, his ""vampire"" reputation in Europe is from a different origin, not from the Turks, but from the Germans. 

The German merchants of Transylvania were upset by what we would call today ""economic protectionism"": Vlad didn't allow foreign merchants to sell wares directly in fairs and markets in Wallachia. The German merchants would have to sell their wares whole-sale at the Transylvanian-Wallachian border to local Wallachian merchants, who would then sell it in the country.

That's strictly false. Same conditionalities could apply. This was actually an idea that was suggested and rejected by the creditors. Reforms in exchange for debt relief. We're not talking about something for nothing here. 

Second of all, the conditionalities were never focused on fixing corruption and tax evasion. I can't believe people in the creditor countries still believe that.

&gt; Je viens des Etats-Unis, et j'étudie à Angers ce semestre. Comme toutes les jeunes femmes Américain*es*, mes amis et moi ador*ons* Paris. Je parlais avec une amie aux Etats-Unis, et je *lui ai* demandé si elle voudrai*t* *un* souvenir de Paris, parce que je *m'y rends souvent*. Elle m'a dit non, elle *n'a besoin* de rien, mais elle a vu des photos des ""Love Locks,"" et elle voudrait *que je mette* un Love Lock pour elle et son petit-ami.

&gt; Je sais que la plupart des Parisiens n'aiment pas les Love Locks, et personnellement, je les trouve *laids*. Alors, je *lui ai* dit que je ne vais mettre un Love Lock, mais je vais faire quelque chose d'autre spéciale*ment* pour elle.

&gt; Alors, ma question: Est-*ce qu'*il y a une bonne façon de ""laisser quelque chose d'elle"" à Paris? Quelque chose qui *ne soit* pas *laid*, *illégal*, *dangereux*, ou *détesté* par les Parisiens ? Est-*ce qu'*il y a des projets publi*cs* d'art ou quelque chose comme ça? *Des* projet*s* ou organisations qui *ont* besoin *de* dons? Un jardin publi*c* *où* je *pourrais* planter des *fleurs* pour elle? Elle est artiste, alors je pense que si ""elle"" *avait* quelque chose dans *un* projet d'art à Paris, elle serait très heureuse.

&gt; Si je peux, je *voudrais* laisser quelque chose pour elle à Paris, parce qu'elle voudrait *y* aller, mais elle n'a pas assez d'argent *pour le moment*. Aussi, si je peu*x* donner quelque chose *de* positi*f* pour améliorer ou augmenter la ville, ça sera*it* parfait.

&gt; Je sais que c'est un*e* demande un peu bizarre, mais je voudrais vraiment faire quelque chose pour une de mes meilleures ami*e*s qui *ne soit pas* pas un Love Lock. Merci beaucoup et bonne journée!

I'm not sure that wanting independance and sovereignty for his country qualify of chauvinism.

 &gt;The Cold War ended decades ago yet you still have American bases in the UK, Germany, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece... why is that? 

Because of geopolitical/diplomatical inertia. Entering into an alliance is seen as a big step toward one's partner but quitting an alliance create friction. That, and the fact that NATO is quite convenient for nations who just want a defensive military effort.

&gt;when it comes to realpolitik, the EU is a non-entity subservient to USA.

WeLl, that's where some distinction is useful. When it comes to realpolitik, the EU is virtually absent. But the nations-states composing it are present, active and have some substantial independance.

&gt;And well, can you imagine USA getting involved into another Korean war? No? Why?

I can see plenty of reason for the USA considering another korean war as a bad idea. I think that you can too. for exemple, preserving peace and stability for south korea, and avoiding something akin to irak war's economical and political cost.
And having a huge chunk of public debt is a good leverage to pressure another big player, but it is far from being the only one. USA-China relationship isn't as unbalanced as you make it seems by  saying ""USA needs no counterweight because it's already owned by China.""

PS:For the record I too think that the USA is a far better main partner for us than china or russia, but an unbalanced relationship like the one we currently have isn't wishable from an european viewpoint. I am just disagreeing on the scale of the unbalancement that you mentionned, as I dislike hyperboles and simplifications when discuting complicated matters between serious people.",null,0,null,1428413513,null,0,1428419783,0,cq42k7d,null,t3_31q5zg,null,t1_cq42k7d,null,t1_cq411o8,null,null,null,1432245366,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null
null,false,Gerhard_Koepcke,null,null,null,"First off, I wouldn't say you should change your topic as i remember my sister writing a paper for school some years ago about the ""neue unterschicht"", which should be exactly what you mean and she did it well, i think. 

Now i can only speak from my guts, as i have never studied german assis professionally, yet i See them a lot.

My Personal Definition of a perfect assi would be someone who lives in a ""plattenbau"", receives money from the state (Hartz) and watches tv Most of the Day (Check out ""Rtl"" and ""Rtl 2"" for some examples (as for Shows, try ""mitten im Leben"", ""köln 50667"" and maybe ""the geissens"")). He would read the BILD-""newspaper"" (biggest piece of Boulevard in Germany/All of europe) but ""only for the Sports"", as Most other newspapers in Germany have more Information, less Sports, but that's just an excuse IMO.

The old-school-assi can be imagined as a chubby guy sitting in front of his tv, watching soccer, drinking canned beer, wearing a stained ""rippshirt"" and commenting on how Bad the players and/or the referee is acting.

This guy would be called ""proll"".

Younger assis can be found in your local Club every weekend, sporting trucker caps, white sneakers and Shirts with the brand's Name written all over them (mostly jack&amp;jones and real superdry where i'm coming from) and they like to get into fights over nothing. They like cheap American music (think David guetta) though recently they discovered trap/bass and what they Call ""techno"", essentially being ""charts-house"". When they are Not clubbing, you can find them by the Bus Station, smoking weed and spitting on the ground, sometimes creating ""spit-lakes"" in front of their feet. I don't think they're waiting for the Bus, anyway. They Talk about cars, soccer and women, and are Not much different from American assis, i'd presume. 

The Girls that hang out with those guy are heavily disfigured by kilograms of make-up, permanent eye brows and a few piercings every now and then. The wear a lot of white clothes( pants, that is. Also dark Jeans with white Spots where their asses would be located, like they where sitting in bleach), often times too small, as they are more copulous than they want to admit, or they Are skinny and act as a role model for the chubby Girls, as they Do the Same stuff but still look ""good"", as in unnaturally attractive. They have lots of pink and sparkly stuff (like phone-cases and such) and for some reason they always hold their phones in the Same Hand that carries their oversized handbags, perhaps to prevent stealing. 

Yes, many assis are immigrants, which is a result of the failed ""Integrationspolitik"" IMO, ""hartzer"" are often put into ""plattenbauten"" where they have little culture and little exchange, but more crime.

There's One thing to say about assi's, it's that they might be the Same on the outside, but every now and then it's nice to meet an assi and find out that he's an overall great guy, nice and funny, who just has the wrong friends. But he could also be the guy kicking you to the ground for talking to ""his girl"" or just looking at him. 

I could go on and on about this topic, but i'm already forgetting what i started with, and it's All just impressions and stereotypes, so i'll just leave it at that.

Like i said before, These are just my Personal impressions and of that only what came to my mind right now, therefore Don't take anything of it for granted. Anyway, i hope you have some little overview which helps you to make your own opinion.

If anyone wants to discuss anything i said above, feel Free to comment.

Poi per certi aspetti un feto o un embrione sono comunque, a livello filosofico, 'meno persona' (si, lo so che suona orrendo) di un maiale o un bovino adulto, a meno di non usare definizioni molto specifiche ('sono persone perché lo diventeranno')

Invece quando si parla degli animali che comunemente mangiamo, anche chi se ne nutre allegramente e disprezza i vegetariani ammette che gli animali hanno comunque una mente, possono soffrire, possono essere maltrattati ecc (parlo di mammiferi, non di molluschi o esseri simili).
Poi molti ne fanno una questione meramente estetica, del tipo 'si, gli animali soffrono ecc ecc, peccato, ma sono così saporiti!'.

I recall from my high school studies that Josef Radetzky's rule (yes, the one of the March) over Northern Italy was pretty strict and sometimes cruel.

The funny thing is that the English wikipage... 

&gt; After his triumph in Italy, he was made Viceroy of Lombardy-Venetia from 1848 to 1857 - being the only one not of royal Habsburg blood. In spite of his success against Italian patriots, even in Italy he is not remembered unkindly : he was regarded as a fair ruler (for an enemy) and a gentleman who paid his debts.

... and the Italian wikipage tell two radically different stories. I'll stick with the Italian version. Fuck Radetzky!

&gt; Sin da poco prima della vittoria definitiva, il Nostro si dedicò all'amministrazione del Lombardo-Veneto ma non seppe mai svincolarsi da un atteggiamento strettamente repressivo, assai simile a quello che, all'inizio del 1848, aveva spinto all'esasperazione le popolazioni soggette, costringendole, in qualche modo, a dare il via all'insurrezione. [...] Dal 1848 sottopose molti alla cerimonia della “pubblica bastonatura”, eseguì quasi 1 000 condanne a morte per insurrezione o altri delitti politici e molte più ne comminò. Alla gran parte dei numerosissimi condannati alla forca, infatti, la pena veniva commutata in lustri di carcere pesante ai ferri: è certo che nelle intenzioni del governatore tali conversioni dovessero apparire innegabili segni di grazia cesarea, ma gli italiani le interpretarono sempre come arbitrarie esercizi di violenza.

We'll both have really big backpacks with because we go on a multiple weeks long hiking tour.

Also do we have super aware of thieves and pickpocketing? I think big backpacks could attract them and the packs limit your mobility and overview a bit, so how's about that?

From there you can even go on and play rearranged or selfcomposed stuff.

Both sides in a conflict can just decide to stop the fighting and return to diplomatic relationships with embassies and everything. It's right that the London Agreement in 1953 made a peace treaty mandatory to settle the reparations dispute, but in general there is no formal treaty necesarry, just like you don't have to declare war to start it.

Germany and the allied forces agreed that the 2+4 treaty replaces a formal peace treaty. Greece as member of the OSZE has signed the Paris Charta which, by interpretation of Germany and presumably the allied forces and most OSZE countries, achknowledges this fact and the conclusion of any outstanding reparation claims. 

Good luck trying make a case in court about that interpretation, about what Greece has agreed to and about what they have received as reparations and if that was enough to settle any claims. Ever wondered why Greece hasn't contacted Den Haag yet? My bet is because they know that a) they have no chance of winning anything and that b) it could take decades to settle the dispute. Even if there were justified claims, no on Greece should hope that the debt crisis will be solved through German reparations.

As a Finn it's hard to understand why the parliament can't just be located in Brussels all the time? Let's send the whole parliament to Strasbourg just so France still can claim that the parliament is officially located there. Since the parliament is legally forced to vote and have a minimum amount of meetings there, they have to regularly take a four hours long trip both ways just to get their job done. Things like this makes me really question EU, if we can't agree on a location where the EU institutions should be located, move them around every 5 years or something, instead of these stupid compromises that only are there to save someone's pride. (I guess that is a compromise itself, but makes it at least more effective)

&gt;The European Parliament has three places of work – Brussels (Belgium), the city of Luxembourg (Luxembourg) and Strasbourg (France). Luxembourg is home to the administrative offices (the 'General Secretariat'). Meetings of the whole Parliament ('plenary sessions') take place in Strasbourg and in Brussels. Committee meetings are held in Brussels

I guess we can't make people learn a new language every 5 years, so just go with the one people already speak? In twenty years no one will care what language we did choose anyway, cause the  world is constantly changing and the choices we do really don't matter in the end. If every country started teaching out Greek today, people will start identifying themselves with that in the future. The facts are that English is the most useful language overall in the world and the language most Europeans speak - what we should do is an easy choice. 

Notice, I am not in favour for wounding the local identities of people in any way just to force on them an European identity.

I always tought that [philippe le bel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_IV_of_France) was kind of a dick (for exemple, he persecuted the knight templars to get his hands on their goods and send one of his man slap the pope) and [Charles VI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_VI_of_France) had crises of demence (so yeah, technically the craziest ruler our country had.

&gt;His goal in the Terror was to use the guillotine to create what he called a 'republic of virtue', wherein terror and virtue, his principles, would be imposed. He argued, ""Terror is nothing more than speedy, severe and inflexible justice; it is thus an emanation of virtue; it is less a principle in itself, than a consequence of the general principle of democracy, applied to the most pressing needs of the patrie.""[74]

It's far more complicated than that, usually it's self identification that matters, and usually people who are speaking russian as a first language are identifying themselves as russians. Because of the culture.

More - russian nationalists usually are heavily USSR bashing because for them it's an oppressive regime who was oppressing ethnically russian people. Those are people who understand ""russian"" as an ethnicity.

Now russian ""patriots"", those who understand ""russian"" as a culture or self-identified ""allegiance"" to the russian state, perceive USSR as a part of it's history, maybe not always glorious, but history. And taken that USSR was massively and universally bashed in russian media in 90s and early 00s - now that pendulum swinged in the other direction as there's a big disellusionment in the west. Maybe a bit naive one, but still. Those ""patriots"" are at war with ""nationalists"" btw.

This is misleading.

Now it mostly means a country within Lithuania Propria, with mostly Baltic Lithuanian speaking population.

But in different times it had different meaning. Lithuania as a geographic term means the lands you mention. Grand Duchy of Lithuania is a multiethnic polity, where not control, but cooperation was key of it's existence. You can say Rus waged half a millennium long civil war, where Grand Duchy of Lithuania on one side meant tolerance, prosperity, European civilisation, multi centric society, and Moscow on other side meant autocracy, oprichnina and isolation.

Saying control implies Lithuania conquered those lands, when in fact the very meaning of word Lithuania means military confederacy, where the Russian cities mostly joined the stronger polity and warred for it's cause. Russian culture, religion not only survived, but developed and prospered in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. So no. It is not a control.

Thus, if you ignore the Lithuanian part of Poland's history and thus take the modern history, Poland and Germany have about as much experience fighting and being occupied by the Russians. Before the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Russia didn't even exist.

There is very hard to maintain democracy with current levels of equality in Russia.

Che è una cosa che nessuno fa - nemmeno gli erbivori, AFAIK.

&gt; una vacca o un agnello o una pecora o un pavone sono animali da preda,

Sono ""prede"" ovvero ""animali da fuga"" - nel contesto gli animali da preda sarebbero infatti gli umani. 

&gt;caricarli di un sentire che non sono neppure in grado di sviluppare. Proiettare su un animale concetti e sentimenti umani è da deficienti.

Ma naturalmente il dilemma non riguarda cosa sente l'animale^(*) (che poi, tu hai mai visto uccidere un maiale? è un'esperienza istruttiva). La questione riguarda se e quanto sia morale **dal punto di vista umano** infliggere senza alcuna necessità sofferenze ad altri esseri  viventi.  E aggiungo quanto lo sia, oggi, in una società evoluta, perchè non credo la questione possa seriamente porsi per un cacciatore/raccoglitore del neolitico, che  o mangia il capriolo o muore.

Io non sono vegetariano, ma noto (con approvazione) che sono molte le situazioni in cui estendiamo agli animali privilegi normalmente accordati agli essere umani - non mangiamo (più)i nostri animali di affezione; tendiamo sempre di più a criminallizzare i maltrattamenti degli animali, pratichiamo la caccia poco e con crescente disagio, etc.

&gt; è da deficienti.

Come rivalutare i vegetariani con un paio di frasi ben piazzate.

From the early origins of pre-vedic doctrines, to later puranic treatises bestow the importance of vegetarianism, especially the Sattvic diet.[17] There are three main reasons for this: the principle of nonviolence (ahimsa) applied to animals,[18] the intention to offer only ""pure"" (vegetarian) food to a deity and then to receive it back as prasad,[19] and the conviction that non-vegetarian food is detrimental for the mind and for spiritual development. Many Hindus point to scriptural bases, such as the Mahabharata's maxim that ""Nonviolence is the highest duty and the highest teaching,""[20] as advocating a vegetarian diet.

There are many Hindu groups that have continued to abide by a strict vegetarian diet in modern times. Vegetarian diet reflects the way of the traditional living ways of Indian people. One example is the movement known as ISKCON (International Society for Krishna Consciousness), whose followers “not only abstain from meat, fish, and fowl, but also avoid certain vegetables that are thought to have negative properties, such as onion, mushrooms and garlic.”[21] A second example is the Swaminarayan Movement. The followers of this Hindu group also staunchly adhere to a diet that is devoid of meat, eggs, and seafood.[22] Vegetarians generally avoid addictive substances, including tea and coffee. Their food reflects a simple Indian meal based on rice and dal, vegetable, chapattis, yogurt and milk. Also, as they are farming, they normally do not hurt worms that appear on the organic produce.[23]

Vegetarianism is propagated by the Yajurveda and it is recommended for a satvic (purifying) lifestyle.[24] Thus, another reason that dietary purity is so eminent within Hinduism is because “the idea that food reflects the general qualities of nature: purity, energy, inertia”; it follows that a healthy diet should be one that promotes purity within an individual.[21]

The topic is (but rather offtopic to op), why the lingua franca isn't French, and I remarked that is the case because French chauvinists didn't allow French citizens to settle on French territory in North America.

&gt; &amp;quot;Though the goal of the bill is to place France&amp;#039;s surveillance practices under the rule of law, it in fact uses law to clothe a naked expansion of surveillance powers,&amp;quot; said Dinah PoKempner, HRW general counsel.

&gt; The bill contains no requirement for judicial review of surveillance measures before they are put into effect, unless a majority of the nine appointed members of a new executive advisory body, the National Control Commission on Intelligence Techniques, disagree with the French prime minister&amp;#039;s decision.

&gt; Surveillance measures - which may include hacking and malware - could be indefinitely renewed without judicial scrutiny or notification to the target.

null,false,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,null,"&gt; On a personal note it is surprising that the vikings did not have a larger influence on the language than they did. As I understand it they relatively quickly assimilated compared to e.g. the Normans.

I think it is partly because the language that the Vikings spoke, Old Norse, was not so very different from the Anglo-Saxon spoken by the English at that time? So I think it was easier for Old Norse to be assimilated into the English language. Also, I think the Vikings in Britain were not living so separate lives from the English compared to the Normans? But I don't know very much about this.

There are some words of Norse origin from the Vikings, which have a direct Anglo-Saxon equivalent, e.g. ""craft"" and ""skill"" or, ""anger"" and ""wrath"" or ""sick"" and ""ill"" or ""wish"" and ""want"". Many of these words are used interchangeably by Brits now or just have subtle differences in meaning but I guess they are all part of the Germanic family of vocabulary rather than the Romance family...

Ok, I was wrong, *fish stinks from the head*.

Unity of Albania and Kosovo is one thing, **unification of Albanians** is completely different thing.

Serbs (and they had been powered big time by English and French on issue), as nation, had their unification in *Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes*, *Kingdom of Yugoslavia*, *Federative People's Republic of Yugoslavia* and finally *Socialistic Federative Republic of Yugoslavia*.

Moreover the lack of strategic reserve proved itself fatal when the Germans pierced the French lane because no unit were ready to stop the German advance.

Germany did not have a technological advantage over France or Britain at the start of the war but inferior doctrine (brought by WW1 mentality) and gross strategic negligence (to be fair the Allies were not expecting a mechanised offensive in the Ardennes as they thought tanks could not go there hence the lack of strategic reserve here).",null,0,null,1428419795,null,0,false,0,cq4640p,null,t3_31q4pl,null,t1_cq4640p,null,t1_cq446vj,null,null,null,1432247039,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

Don't worry, even a local would feel a little thrown off if that happened to them, but this is the law and you can't say no. Probably there was something going on and they had to do that.

Just remember to have an ID on you next time you leave your house, even a foreign one is ok. There are some anti-terrorism laws in Italy that are much stricter than in other EU and non-EU countries. For example, to check in an Italian hotel, you must give an ID to the hotel. I remember one time you couldn't even get it back until the end of your stay, now I think just a copy of it is fine but I'm not sure.

Mind that German is a complicated language for some and it might take a few months to get the basics. You cannot just magically learn everything over night. 

I'll just refer you to our [Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/German/wiki/index) for materials and copy-paste my answer from there:

There isn't really a ""perfect"" solution, and answers to this question can vary widely. Having [a proper teacher](http://www.reddit.com/r/German/wiki/feebasedcourses) can be very useful, especially since they can provide you with immersion, feedback and additional learning discipline, but it's not a must. If you want to teach the German language to yourself, I would recommend a multimedia approach using [apps](http://www.reddit.com/r/German/wiki/apps) like Duolingo and Memrise, online [materials and courses](http://www.reddit.com/r/German/wiki/freecourses) and [a good textbook](http://www.reddit.com/r/German/wiki/textbooks). To speed up the learning process, [immerse yourself](http://www.reddit.com/r/German/wiki/index#wiki_table_of_contents_-_immersion). Read [German books](http://www.reddit.com/r/German/wiki/books), listen to [German music](http://www.reddit.com/r/German/wiki/music) and [podcasts](http://www.reddit.com/r/German/wiki/audio), watch [German films](http://www.reddit.com/r/German/wiki/filmsandseries), and keep yourself updated by using [German news outlets](http://www.reddit.com/r/German/wiki/news).

You hit the nail on the head. The Normans did not want to associate with the commoners of English society, and so dissociated themselves with the rest of the nation. It is why we have separate names for meat when its not cooked (cow, sheep, pig) and when it is (beef, mutton, pork) because the uncooked meat was used by the lower classes, and the cooked meat was used by the nobility (Normans).

Look up the chapters that Serbia is negotiating with the EU. There is one called Chapter 31: Foreign, security and defence policy. http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/policy/conditions-membership/chapters-of-the-acquis/index_en.htm

This is not about dictating. The EU foreign policy is decided by unanimity by all the members but if Serbia wants to join a club than it has to respect the rules and values of that club. 

What op said is that giving Serbia a veto over EU foreign policy might not be a good idea and I added that there is worry about that and thus reduced enthusiasms about accepting Serbia as a member. There is time to adapt that and there are several years of negotiations ahead but Serbia is not making itself popular by being friendly with Russia in these times.

Obviously the debt was bough from the debtors, not from greece.
But this also enabled a rescheduling of the payments which makes it much easier for greece to restructure its economy.

The problem they have currently is that (obviously) restructuring one's economy doesn't happen in 3 years much more easily than it would have happened overnight, and that there is no european plan to fund invest in the greek economy.

I don't really get why they keep focusing on the debt when they would find support easily for an european investment plan (think Italy, France).",null,0,null,1428422535,null,0,false,0,cq47vma,null,t3_31q80q,null,t1_cq47vma,null,t1_cq452yz,null,null,null,1432247871,null,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2,null

   During the war, the king of France Charles VI (1368-1380†1422) is an insane man (today, we would say he's schizophrenic). His wife, Isabeau de Bavière takes advantage of his condition to make him sign the treaty with the english. In the treaty:  his wife Isabeau makes him declare that the heir and his own son Charles VII is a bastard (which also hurts the reputation of the king quite a bit, because that would mean his spouse Isabeau was unfaithful), therefore unworthy to inherit the Crown. Additionaly he gives away his own daughter to the king of England, which would make him king of France as well in a mariage which too place on June the 2nd the same year in the church of Saint-Jean-Au-Marché. So in one treaty, he gives away the kingdom, marry his daughter to the enemy and betray his son who's fighting the english.


Later, the victories of Charles VII, with the help of Joan of Arc makes the treaty void. The monarchy in France also evolved, as scholars were looking for a way to make the treaty useless, they came up with the rule that the kingdom doesn't belong to the king of France, and therefore he cannot give it away.


Still, the kings of England officialy kept the title of King of France for four centuries, before giving it up in 1802 after the peace of Amiens.

However yes there is a lot english in music, and quite a few signs that are in english.

For the second part, that is because we would much rather speak in english than have you be uncomfortable trying to get out a german sentence or two, if you actually tell them that you want to practice I don't know anyone who wouldn't switch back to german, you see we do that to make you feel more comfortable and would see ourselfs as beeing impolite if we didn't!

As you probably have experienced, if you talk with germans abroad in english or any other language most of them will at some point apologize for their bad language skills, I don't know why but we are relatively self conscious about how we speak and we assume others are aswell so in order to make you feel embarassed we switch to english, the language you are comfortable with.

But literally if they do that, just be nice and ask them if you oculd talk in german (or just continue talking in german) and explain that you want to learn the language, bonus points if you say that learning the language is one of the reasons you came to germany/other german speaking country, they then will be extremely happy and talk about everything and anything in german to you constantly, but depending on who exactly you are talking to they might get into the habbit of correcting every single mistake you make, soooo thats not such a pleasant experience I could imagine =P",null,0,null,1428423220,null,0,false,0,cq48bqd,null,t3_31q5zg,null,t1_cq48bqd,null,t1_cq47ny5,null,null,null,1432248152,null,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2,null

Mainly pointing out that for a racist the ""argument"" comes after the hate. It is an excuse rather than a cause. Same applies to Islamophobia. 

2. I also criticised extremist Islam, such as in Saudi Arabia, myself. I condemned it. I also condemned the violence. Also explaining how the West (our countries) is actually the driving force behind this kind of Islam. But I made that specific criticism. Such as ""I think the government of Zimbabwe and personally Robert Mugabe is genocidal."" Instead of such blanket racist statements as ""blacks are incapable of government"". Do you see the difference?

3. I also explained the difficult balance between free speech and censorship that we have in Europe, for example regarding Holocaust denial and other hate speech. 

Yet even though you claim to have read what I wrote, you still write that I equate criticism (and free speech) to racism. Which is bullshit. What I did write (can you remember this comment, I bet not) is that racism is often covered by free speech and that while I don't support the racism, I support the free speech. You hide your racism by saying it is about ""criticism of religion"". And I point out your racism. Take the Mugabe example again. If someone was to say ""black people are incapable of government themselves"" and I was to point out their racism, they would answer (in your spirit) that I equate all criticism of black people to racism. I do not. 

All I do is that I equate Islamophobia to racism.

The other is that the Albanians are the descendants of Illyrian tribes located north of the Jireček Line and probably north or northeast of Albania


The only thing that is scientific proved based on various genetic studies that have been done on the European population, some of them including current Albanian population, Albanian-speaking populations outside Albania, and the Balkan region as a whole is that the two haplogroups most strongly associated with Albanian people ([E-V13](http://i.imgur.com/rlF80Na.png) and [J2b](http://cdn.eupedia.com/images/content/Haplogroup-J2b.gif)) are often considered to have arrived in Europe from the Near East with the Neolithic revolution or late Mesolithic, **early in the Holocene epoch** (11,700 calendar years BP). From here in the Balkans, it is thought, they spread to the rest of Europe. More recently, Lacan et al. (2011) announced that a **7000 year old** skeleton in a Neolithic context in a Spanish funeral cave, was an **E-V13 man.** (The other specimens tested from the same site were in haplogroup G2a, which has been found in Neolithic contexts throughout Europe.) Using 7 STR markers, this specimen was identified as being similar to modern individuals tested in **Albania, Bosnia, Greece, Corsica, and Provence.**

Dire che ognuno mangia quello che vuole, per chi non mangia carne vuol dire usare una logica che contraddisse se stessa. Per loro, i vegetariani (e anche per altri) non ""va bene"" fare sempre quello che vuoi fare. O più precisamente - va bene farlo solo quando non fai male agli altri. Va bene mangiare un essere umano? Un cane? Gli essere umani sono più intelligenti (in alcuni aspetti) da altri animali, ma, secondo i vegetariani, questo non ci dà il diritto di sfruttare e fare male a chi è meno intelligenti di noi.
Poi, viene la parte in cui il carnivoro dice ""e allora non guidare la macchina perché fa male all'ambiente"" e ha ragione. Ma ancora si tratta di una logica che non serve il suo proprio bersaglio stesso. Perché? Perché è come dire ""il male c'è già nel mondo, è inevitabile, allora facciamo che cazzo vogliamo"". 
Quindi il vegetarianismo non è così assurdo, si tratta di persone che non pensano che va bene ammazzare mucche e cani ecc per il nostro piacere, e non c'entrano argomenti come ""il male nel mondo ci sarà sempre"" oppure ""altri animali lo fanno in natura"" perché con questi argomenti si può tentare di giustificare in questo modo tutti, o quasi tutti, i crimini possibili.

Scusate l'italiano, sono straniero.

EDIT: voglio solo chiarire - non intendevo di giudicare nessuno, solo provare a spiegare quello che mi sembra il punto di vista dei vegetariani / vegani (generalizzando ovviamente). Capisco che per alcuni di voi il trattamento serio di questo argomento vuol dire rompere le palle, ma non dovete partecipare nella discussione. E certo che non c'è nessun obbligo da parte vostra giustificare per me o per noi il vostro stile di vita, ma il take home message che volevo trasmettere è che questo articolo espone affermazioni importanti e vale la pena trattarlo seriamente (e apprezzo chi lo fa).",null,0,null,1428425078,null,0,1428425740,0,cq49kq1,null,t3_31qfni,null,t1_cq49kq1,null,t3_31qfni,null,null,null,1432248741,null,5,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,5,null

Bring as much ethics as you are interested in, it doesn't change my stand point from an outsider looking in. What Syriza is doing is working, because people like you will try to connect to a past (3 generations ago) to excuse yourself from your mistakes of today.

* Yes me, because even after 70-200 years, my people still have to look at your people and shiver because the mentality of trying to get the best out of someone else continues. Whether it is trying to get the best of a fellow Greek, a German or a Bulgarian.

*Germany provided the bail out knowing that it would affect the whole Euro system even though YOUR GOVERNMENTALLY ELECTED COUNTRY decided to leave its OWN BANKS &amp; COFFERS to the bottom. Part of the money had to go to the banks, the banks are an essential part of the financial system that lets your country thrive under normal circumstances. The problem is that YOUR PEOPLE &amp; THEIR GOVERNMENTALLY ELECTED POLITICIANS decided to take the easy way.

Of course they had to demand that, since when does a 53% face value cut means ""full party, lets have fun""? You should learn about finance &amp; economics before you bring out these examples. They DEMANDED that the Greek population should live within its means. What makes the Greeks so special that they can just circumvent the norms of Finance? Talk to me about your 14th check per year (yea, the year has 12 months), talk to me about your retirement years, about your minimum wage, talk to me about all your social benefits that are considered outliers in comparison to the average EU nation. NOW TELL ME, WHAT MAKES YOU SPECIAL?

* Greece is like that junkie family member, always blame someone else. Always asks for money, promising that it will put into good economical use. You can go on and on.

Believe me, there are plenty of very good Greek people out there where you can have a solid conversation. Reality is, most of them already left the country Greece, because they know that whoever is left in there, are the ones voting for people like Syriza to be in power.

Non. Un des plus gros problèmes pour la Grèce c'est celui de la corruption et de la fraude fiscale. Pour autant que j'aime ce pays, son histoire et ses habitants, je me dois de reconnaître que les la corruption est vraiment présente et pas seulement au sein du gouvernement, tout comme la fraude (si je me souviens bien il fut une époque où on parlait de sport national).

Dans l'idée, je suis totalement pour que l'Allemagne soit ""remise à sa place"". L'expérience nous a peu ou prou montré que les idées de l'ami Wolfgang ont peu de chance de fonctionner ailleurs que chez lui, et qu'il faudrait qu'il cesse de vouloir les imposer à des pays aux contextes si différents. Mais j'ai quand même de gros doutes sur la viabilité des projets du nouveau gouvernement grec. Parce que là aussi l'expérience montre que que la Grèce n'a que peu d'arguments en sa faveur pour qu'on lui fasse une confiance sans faille (comptes truqués, déclarations de projets inconsidérés, passé rempli d'échecs à rembourser leurs dettes, ...).  
Ce dont on peut se féliciter en revanche, c'est que les marchés ont actuellement l'air de ne pas trop lui retirer leur confiance.

Unsurprisingly, his support in Moscow waned very quickly and Polish forces were kicked out of Russia shortly.

zeh germans wollen den totalen krieg

und wie die AfD argumentiert muss Volkes Wille anscheinend richtig sein. 

Müssen sich jetzt nur genügend Alt-Grüne finden die Sex mit Kindern legalisieren wollen - dann ist ja jeder Kindesmisbrauch nur passiert, weil die Gesetzgebung den Willen des Volkes missachtet.
&lt;/s&gt;

Es kann keine absolute Meinungsfreiheit geben. 
Die Meinung Flüchtlinge ""gehören hier nicht her"" ist genauso inakzeptabel wie der Wunsch nach Sex mit Kindern oder Nationalbefreite Zonen, Maut nur für Ausländer und all diese dummen Aussagen vom geistig-unteren Rand der Gesellschaft.

Und nur weil Herr Henkel Geld hat, ist er noch lange nicht klug/weise.

Niemand sollte auf die Nazis in Dresden, Guben, Tröglitz usw. hören - sie sind nicht relevanter Teil unserer Gesellschaft, sondern Verfassungsfeinde die wir abwehren müssen.

Anyway, you forget one important thing: Germany did not receive the debt relief out of solidarity, but to establish Germany as a democratic and capitalist stronghold. And more importantly there was a clear perspective that Germany would develop as intended and expected. 

Now to the Greek situation: To grant them a debt relief, we would need the guarantee that Greece will not only flourish and again, but more importantly develop a stable economy that won't crumble under the next crisis. Do we have that guarantee? Have they reduced corruption? Have they improved their tax morale? Have they reduced deomestic spending for their bloated bureaucracy and military services? Have they installed reforms in support for business founders?

We have no such guarantee, so what is what you want? Carte blanche handed out by Germany  for Greece to carry on like nothing happened - and crash into the next crisis in five or ten years? Against the will of the Eurozone, who block a debt relief as well and of which some member states have even more radical views on the Greek situation than Germany. Yes, that's right! It's not just Germany. Try to convince Finland, Slovenia, Netherlands, France or Spain and the rest of Eurozone that Greece should receive a debt relief ""because Germany 1953"".

By the way, is anybody ever supposed to pay their debts again (except for the Lannisters of course) or will we always point the finger at Germany and 1953? Or does that only go for money owed to Germany? When you need money, lend it from Germany and just remind them of 1953 and their guilt when they want it back?

I'm German, and I'm not happy with my government either. They have to get of their high horses and stop patronizing the Greek people! And I agree that many reforms were useless or even catastrophic, and I'd rather see reforms that aim at growth rather than solely reducing domestic spending (and just like Germany 1953 Greece should be granted a repayment plan that serves the debts based on the annual economical growth). These are all reasons why I have been voting as far left as possible since, well, forever (as far as possible means ""not that former SED party""). But there are reforms that have to be mandatory for Greece, and so far Greece hasn't done much to implement these reforms. Tax morale is still low, corruption is still high and the bureaucracy and military services are still bloated. With all due respect, so far the Greek government (especially Syriza) hasn't done much to earn the trust of their European partners and convince them, that another(!) haricut would pave the way for a positive future.",null,0,null,1428426668,null,0,false,0,cq4an7d,null,t3_31oc36,null,t1_cq4an7d,null,t1_cq46sn7,null,null,null,1432249244,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

In homeric Greek the word sea was Thalassa (or Thalatta in Dorian) as is in modern  Greek :Thalassa. Exactly the same.
Theta in homeric greek  is exactly the same in modern Greek  and means the letter Θ theta.
Pure nonsense. 
If you want more examples that link is full of them.

-The second reason is that the author in that link uses 78 albanian words that sound like Greek ones but have a different meaning whatsover.  
Example:
zie—————————————–zei————————————–vrazi

Zei in homeric Greek means ""stink, bad odor"". The same goes with modern Greek.
In Greek (both homeric and modern) the word ""boil"" is Vrasmos 
Vrazi is the word in a different aspect and mood (hence the grammatical transformation).
So the author finds Zei to be the same word with Vrasmos (boil) or Zesi (stink, bad odor) ? 
 
Also 78 words are far too few to make any connection. What happens with the other 10s of thousands that are the same in both homeric and modern Greek but way different in Albanian?

&gt; locale da hipster (slow fast food? lel)

Mi sembra ingiusto giudicare il locale sulla base del suo essere o meno da hipster o comunque delle sue implicazioni. A me del movimento slow food non interessa molto; non scelgo dove e cosa mangiare sulla base di una ideologia. Tuttavia, senza stare a dargli un nome, l'idea del locale è quella di un fast food con prodotti locali, il che mi trova d'accordo sia perché supporta le aziende locali e perché magari mi dà delle garanzie in più sulla qualità del cibo. Se questo significa pagare un po' di più, lo faccio volentieri. C'è qualcosa che non ho considerato/che sto tralasciando? C'è un motivo per il quale questa è una cattiva idea? Se no, che ti importa se è da hipster?

 Idem per l'attenzione all'ambiente: non sono un ambientalista (nel senso che non sceglierei o boicotterei un locale sulla base della loro etica in merito all'ecologia), ma se hanno una politica di rispetto dell'ambiente, non posso che complimentarmi e pensare sia una buona idea.

I am US/CAD. Most of the wars Greece has fought was against the Ottoman Empire in a fight for regional power and land. The idea is simple, get Greece and analyze it with 2-3 other nations that have gone through a similar amount of conflicts and find out whether they had the same amount of sovereign default. Again, Greece tends to be an outlier (in a bad sense).

*1826-42 was after a self-inflicted Civil War

*1843-59 Greece attempted to get back on the market but didn't have a financial structure to stand on top. Greece decides to side with the Russians on the Crimean War (1853-56)

*1860-1878 Continuation of a NO financial, economic and/or political structure that could keep Greece afloat and be able to pay its loans. Ottoman Empire also attempts to gain Greece's lands, but fails to be completely successful due to internal issues among other things

*1894-97 Continuation of Greece vs Ottoman Empire. Between 1897-1930s, there were some attempts at getting back to the financial market, but the market itself was having issues in part, due to WW1 and isolationism. Greece didn't have the infrastructure to house a financial system.

*1932-64 **Before** WW2, Greece continued to be incapable of maintaining a proper financial &amp; economic infrastructure, it exarcebated due to WW2

*2008-present Greek governments prior to the crisis offered its people populist tools in order to gain power. Its people followed along, when the Financial crisis came crashing down, Greece was one of the countries most crippled by the crisis. This was due to the population tax evasion, attempts to get the better out of each other. Also due to government corruption, 'easy money' by being part of the EU, interconnectivity of countries &amp; MBS (Mortgage backed Securities) failure. It is more complicated but I won't bother examplining.

Well, either take ownership of your actions (lack thereoff) and your country's actions or continue to blame everyone else around. Greece is showing its childish mindset in front of the world stage. Your ""is my OWN business"" is also Greece's childish mindset. I can say its my own business when I am tax evading, when I am enjoyining amazing benefits paid in part by other EU nations. It doesn't change the fabric of it, which is the fact that Greece is and has been for a long time, culturally, morally &amp; economically bankrupt.

The greatest military minds, from generals to theorists like Clausewitz for example, spent the following decades studying the French army and Napoleon's war tactics and using them as the basis to develop their own armies.

To claim the British army was more innovative is simply incredibly wrong.

Un journaliste qui fait un vrai travail d'investigation ou il a l'argent ou c'est mort (ou alors tu as une vie de merde ☹)

Les grands médias classiques appartiennent à de riches investisseurs, qui parfois ne respectent même pas leur propre chartre en critiquant leurs propres journalistes si leur travail ne leur plait pas : un exemple de travail qui fâche : mettre en lumière des abus de grosses fortunes. C'est bien de la censure car le prochain journaliste fera 2 fois plus attention avec le type d'information qu'il souhaite couvrir et diffuser. C'est donc non plus de la censure mais de la simple ""auto-censure"" (surtout si ton collègue te dit, ""moi à ta place je ne parlerais pas de ça"").

- soit les gens ne veulent pas savoir qu'ils peuvent être en fait trompés et donc peu de gens vont les lire

Bosnia's constitution at the time dictated (and still dictates) that decisions like this need the Bosnian vote, Croatian vote, and Serbian vote. Yet, this was ignored, the Serbian population was ignored, laws were broken, and the civil way to handle Bosnia splitting from Yugoslavia went out the window.

The question could have been how much land to give Yugoslavia, but Bosnia wanted it all. You could argue that Serbia also wanted more than Bosnia was willing to give, but the point is that there was _still_ a chance of dialogue. Would it have been fair for Serbia to take the majority of land? Probably not. Then why the hell is it fair for Bosnia to take everything? It's not. Hence, the reason for RS's existence.

We *really* could have used some help from the international community before things went to shit, but oh well. If Kosovo sets a precedent joining Albania, there is no reason why RS shouldn't join back with Serbia. (In fact, there is no reason now, and RS's politicians talk about it all the time.)

A banker's job is to calculate the risk and give money where the risk is  acceptable. These bankers failed to do their job as much as the greek governments that failed to protect the interests of their citizens. 
This is not blaming ""others"" as you put it. It is simply the reality.

Also the IMF truly said that the bail out program was a failure. I didn't say that the IMF said it. Look it up yourself. 

As for the fact that on the same time they were giving bail out loans to Greece, they were pressing Greece to use the money to buy arms... also not my words. 
Here, look what a German member of the European parliament was saying back in 2010:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQGkP68AVTI

Most of the wars were between Greece and the Ottoman empire and they were wars of independence not merely ""fight for regional power"" as you put it. 
About the Crimean wars now: you should know there were 2.
On the 1st one Greece had no involvement.
On the second one Greece sided with France against the bolsheviks and send army to fight the communists. Read your history better.

FTFY. Even with Carol II who was the worst king, he still did important things culturally and diplomatic for Romania, not to mention his predecessors who are to be thanked for the creation of our nation.

Antonescu is still ultimately responsible for the rise of the Iron Guard, the slaughter of countless civilians and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of romanian soldiers because he decided to blindly support the Nazis and push with them deeper into Russia when he should've just stayed at the border of Basarabia, like the Finns did with their reclaimed territory.

The NY Times reported that the US and Iran are working together against ISIS in Iraq.  The Iranians are providing support on the ground, while the US applies air power.  We are supposedly not directly coordinating with Iran, but instead using the Iraqi government as an intermediary who passes messages.

Iraq has basically become an Iranian satellite state, so if we want to have any chance of getting some benefit from Bush's invasion of Iraq, we have to achieve decent relations with Iran.

Iran has wanted to work with the US for a long time.  They offered to help fight the Taliban, for example, but Bush declined.  They also offered to help fight al-Qaeda, and I think they did turn over some of them to the US.

And, as you mentioned, if the US can take Iran from Russia, that will help to contain the Ruskies.

null,false,ClitDoctorMD,IREL,Ireland,null,"&gt; I think we can all agree that the European culture is very similar. Spain has a much closer culture with France than with Marocco. Greek is more like Italy rather than Turkey

You see the examples you're pick are countries that are geographically close thus its quite likely culture is similar between geographic neighbours. However take places within the EU take are geographical distant and it simply doesnt apply, eg Ireland and Croatia, Spain and Latvia, Lithuania and France. The geographic distance angle is one that applies across the world and isnt confined to the EU, its simply a result of ethnicities living in one geographic location that was divided in two due to wars etc.

&gt;The culture of Germany is and has always been much closer to the Italian one, Spanish one,British one rather than the Chinese culture.

Substitute Germany with America, Canada etc and the same is true. You've pick China which is a cultural extreme so to say that Germany is more like France than China doesnt really serve your point.

&gt;he Roman Empire and the spread of Christianity played a big rol in this, Latin had many words derived from Greek and now we have Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Rumanian as main neo Latin languages who derive from Latin. English has many words which originate from french, German also has some words which originate from Latin, unlike any asian language.

Language of course have roots in similar historic languages but that doesnt mean the countries themselves are similar. To take the inverse example, the Huns were a group of nomads from Asia who came to settle in Central Europe, therefore the two have a same shared history however I dont think anyone would think central europe and asia have similar cultures.

&gt;We all celebrate the Christian traditions in europe even if many are atheist, we for sure don't celebrate any Islamic tradition. 

By traditions what do you mean exactly? Aside from Easter and Christmas which are celebrated worldwide not just in Europe I dont know what you're referring to.

Just like american is not exactly an ethnic term as it's possible to have irish american or german american, it's close to the soviet ""russian"" the ussr promoted. Any nationalism, russian or not was strongly suppressed. Again - everyone was soviet or ""russian"" in that new sense. Ethnic deportations were done in the time of war as an emergency measure against actual or possible collaborations. One exception is baltic states when it was done to behead the national movement. I'm not trying to say they were right or wrong, i'm just trying to explain you their logic. Everything was done to suppress ethnic nationalism, that's part of their policy to create a new person - soviet man, he can be georgian, russian or lithuanian, but he's soviet first. They understanded well that ethnic nationalism of any kind will be the death of the union, and it basically happened exactly like that. You can say that they tried to push the human evolution, make it faster by creating that big melting pot of a country on an unprecedented level. Again, i'm not saying that they were right or wrong, but you can't say that russians wanted to oppress anyone else and russify them - that's a shallow view of it.

Most of the enlightenment period political philosophy was actually based around republicanism more than a direct, popular-vote kind of democracy.
  
Most philosophers concluded that a certain degree of elitism was necessary in government, and that the people were a more broad check on power - not that every opinion poll approved by the majority should become law. 
  
At least in the US constitution and the declaration of independence, the word ""democracy"" is never used once. The word ""republican"" is though. 
  
However over this last century we've used the term ""democracy"" to broadly mean a government built by free and fair elections, as opposed to other parts of the world run by dictators. But now we've overused the term and come to expect a certain populist attitude towards government that was never really designed for most western governments. 
   
My point is, direct democracy in it's purest form is actually shit. And that was a well made point during the enlightenment period. Athens use to be a direct democracy, and I think Socrates or someone called it more like a mob-rule - it was a really shit thing that often made bad decisions and didn't last too long.

Dessin : je continue, j'ai repris du modèle vivant avec Paris Ateliers, mais je suis toujours nul en couleurs, et j'ai toujours pas trouvé une manière d'être bien à l'aise sur ordi. Du mal à passer du temps sur quelque chose par moi-même. 

Programmation/jeu vidéo : j'alterne les périodes je suis dessus pendant quelques semaines/je laisse tomber pendant des mois. En ce moment c'est une période n°2. J'ai l'impression d'être trop lent et de ne pas avancer avec la programmation et c'est frustrant. Il faut revoir tous les projets à la baisse parce qu'ils sont trop ambitieux; je crois que le jeu vidéo vraiment basique, le genre de projet par lequel il faut commencer, au fond ne m'intéresse pas, et puis je suis pas vraiment inventif en gameplay. La dernière idée en date demande des quantités d'animation que j'avais pas prévu, et je n'ai jamais vraiment touché à ça. J'en garde quand même des idées d'histoire et de personnages, qui pourraient devenir autre chose un jour, une BD, qui sait ?... Dans les deux cas il faudrait aussi avoir des bases d'écriture/dialogue.

L'animation : un rêve pour l'instant. Ca a l'air super dur. 

Troisième langue : en standby, j'aurais pas le temps. Chinois : trop ambitieux. Allemand : motivation moyenne. Le reste : pas vraiment de raison donc pas d'intérêt.

Améliorer l'anglais : je sais pas trop comment. Je suis pas très sociable, je me sens pas d'aller déménager pendant une année ou quelque chose comme ça. Pas d'argent pour les voyages réguliers. J'aimerais peut-être simplement faire une license à l'avenir, pour avoir aussi le côté histoire/""civilisation"". Je lis quelques livres en VO. 

Les sciences humaines : ouais c'est très vague tout ça... Je m'intéresse à un peu pleins de choses, histoire, psychologie, sociologie, philo... Je sais pas par où commencer, ni ce qui m'intéresse vraiment, ni si c'est même possible ou raisonnable d'avoir un peu de bases dans tout ça à la fois. Lu ou commencé quelques livres, comme Les Années 20 (Winock), La Société des Affects (Lordon), Histoire du capitalisme (Beaud), Les contes de fées et l'art de la subversion (Zipes), mais je suis pas sûr de comment prendre des notes et m'en rappeler. Pareil pour l'histoire de la littérature aussi.

Lire un peu plus, dont des ""classiques"" : en cours, je relis Jacques le Fataliste qu'on s'était fait à l'école. Beaucoup plus surpportable quand on sait à quoi s'attendre (ou qu'on a plus de 17 ans peut-être). Tenté par Voltaire après. Je conserve le droit de choisir, je vais pas me taper la totalité de Zola.

The following are also reality that is never brought up by Greeks in Greece:

* The government making decisions are elected by the Greece population

* The degree of transparency of the system is in accordance with what the Greek people voted for

* The population of Greece (and plenty of other nations) don't like nor watch politics, but when things go downhill, they are quick to blame their politicians.

* The IMF &amp; US treasury have said that before, even a few EU nations, but they don't take into consideration that by letting Greece go easy and accepting billions in losses would create PRECEDENCE for future nations (specially the usual culprits)  to do the same, which much larger consequences next time around.

* I LENT you $100 with 20% interest rate (what you are valued at in the open market), since you are part of the 'family' even if you are a junckie (put into perspective), I accept that you are only going to pay back $47 with a 5% interest rate. But in order for me to accept this, you have to promise me that you are going to buy a toy I made valued at $10 and some other pre-conditions in order to get you back on track (not be a junckie). This happens twice in a row (maybe third time is charm).

* As I explained to you, many of them were war between Greece &amp; the Ottoman empire, with funds provided by other nations too. It doesn't take away from the fact that Greece still had a defunct economic, political and financial system. Other nations were facing internal and external conflicts throughout 1750-1990s (de-colonization,etc).  Few went through as many sovereign debt default like Greece

All the points above are valid and explains a counter-argument to you trying to push the blame to other countries (or attempting to use IMF to exemplify your rational for example).

Have you started to see what I am talking about a defunct Greek culture &amp; ethics and its people's inability to take OWNERSHIP for what is happening to their country?
