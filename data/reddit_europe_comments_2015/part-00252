Because I read a lot of Varoufakis' proposals and I think I have a pretty good grasp on the 'northern' parliaments to tell you that it wont go through. None of the ideas listed in his 'modest proposal' for example will have a realistic chance of getting implemented in the current EU setup.

&gt; Varoufakis is a very well respected economist both in economic science and the private sector.

Arguable. He is respected by some, disliked by others. Nobody would deny that this guy is very intelligent, however I disagree with the label 'brilliant'.

An idea bears no worth for solving the crisis if it can not be implemented. If you cant accomplish that - Yay, you developed a cool new theory. Go to a university and teach them to students. Nothing else will happen with it.

&gt; FUCKING BULLSHIT! You are just a guy/gal, who will simply twist everything under a negative prism in order to dismiss everything.

Wrong. I just dislike praising people when it is not due.

------

Quite notable for including a full timeline as well:

With D-Day defined as the day when the drachma formally replaces the euro as 
the national currency of Greece, our indicative recommended timetable is:

**D-Day minus no more than one month:**
 Key officials plan the exit in secret. 
Capital controls implemented immediately and plan accelerated if news leaks out.

**D-Day minus three days (Friday):**
Notification of partners in the euro-zone and 
other international monetary organisations. Followed shortly afterwards by public 
announcement that the changeover to the new currency will take place on D-Day. 
Closure of domestic banks and financial markets. 

**Over the weekend:**
 Authorities announce new policy regime including inflation 
targeting, tough fiscal rules and outlawing of wage indexation. Government 
redenominates its debt and starts negotiations over the terms of this debt. Legal 
issues clarified as far as possible, with plan announced for resolution of those 
issues that remain. Commissioning of new notes and coins.

**D-Day (Monday):**
At 00:01 hours, the drachma is introduced at parity with the 
euro. All domestic wages, prices and other monetary values converted 1-for-1 
from the euro to the drachma. Euro notes and coins remain in use for small 
transactions. 

**D-Day or shortly afterwards:**
 Domestic banks and financial markets reopened. 
Any other capital controls lifted as soon as practicable. Negotiations concluded on 
outstanding legal and other issues raised by redenomination.

**Within 3 to 6 months:**
Sufficient notes and coins available in the new currency for 
the euro to cease to be legal tender in the exiting country. Conversion completed.


------

First few points in the plan:

**1.**
It will not be possible to be open about preparations to leave for more than 
a short period of time. The Finance Minister, Prime Minister, Central Bank 
Governor and a few other key officials should therefore meet to discuss and 
plan the exit in secret.


**2.**
Only when planning is complete should they notify partners in the euro-
zone, including the European Commission and the ECB, whose cooperation 
will be essential in minimising the disruption.


**3.**
Other international organisations, such as the IMF and the world’s major 
central banks, should also be warned so that they can stand ready to support 
the global financial system (for example by injections of large amounts of 
liquidity). But such warnings can plausibly be only a matter of hours before 
the announcement.

**4.**
A public announcement should then be made that the changeover to the new 
currency will take place in a small, specified, number of days’ time (‘D-Day’). 
Immediately after this announcement, domestic banks and financial markets 
should be closed. It would be most practical for the announcement to be 
made on a Friday evening for implementation on Monday.

**5.**
The closure of the banks should negate the need for other forms of capital 
controls, which might otherwise be required if the news leaks out to prevent 
mass withdrawals. More extensive capital controls may still be deemed useful 
in the immediate wake of the euro exit, in order to limit the size of the drop 
in the exchange rate, but at this point they won’t be absolutely necessary and 
may be more trouble than they are worth. Ideally, capital controls should be 
avoided after D-Day and, if used, should be withdrawn as soon as possible.


**6.**
On D-Day itself, we recommend that the new currency, say the drachma, is 
introduced at parity with the euro. All domestic wages, prices, bank loans, 
deposits and other monetary values are therefore to be converted 1-for-1 
from the euro to the drachma.

**7.**
The authorities should allow euro notes and coins to continue to be used for 
small transactions. But straight after the decision to leave the euro has been 
announced, they should commission new notes and coins to be produced 
as soon as possible. 

**8.**
On D-Day, or shortly afterwards, domestic banks and financial markets 
should be reopened. In any event, trade will be taking place in the new (Rest in the full document.....)",null,0,null,1435882297,null,0,false,0,csqh12j,null,t3_3bxm49,null,t1_csqh12j,null,t3_3bxm49,null,null,null,1437538584,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

D'un autre côté, techniquement, la Grèce n'est pas en défaut et ne le sera pas avant un bon moment (si j'ai bien compris, vis-à-vis du FMI, 15 mois minimum après le non-remboursement du prêt le 30 juin). Et en plus, il n'y a aucune disposition pour forcer un pays à quitter la zone euro si ce n'est que l'état membre quitte volontairement l'Union Européenne. Je doute que la BCE coupe complétement les vivres aux banques grecques parce que quoi qu'on en dise les banquiers centraux ont un peu d'humanisme.

On pourrait finir dans une situation assez ubuesque où la Grèce fait techniquement partie de la zone euro et de l'UE mais n'a plus voix au chapitre (c'est envisageable de suspendre les droits de vote de la Grèce au Conseil Européen), la rapprochant de la position du Kosovo ou du Montenegro.

I said 'I don't want to get into the violence' for precisely the reason of what is happening now: you're going through a number of different incidents and subjectively weighing who was responsible for each, and who was worse overall. Not helpful.

I totally understand the Nazis used violence to oppress and terrorise their opponents, but other parties also used violence against the Nazis, and against each other. 

The history of that period's parliamentarians reads like a gang-war. 

And neither was I rendering a full verdict on the constitutionality or legitimacy of the Enabling Act itself, or how it was passed. Even with a lower quora, as you mentioned, it still required the help of Conservatives to pass--so there's at least one group colluding with the Nazis to help them gain power, and it was someone else who had appointed Hitler as Chancellor when it happened.

Now a person can argue that an act like the Enabling Act can never be legitimate, because it suspends powers specifically vested in parliament and overrides the legal and judicial systems. And I'd have no problem with that conclusion.

My point was that the whole thing happened under the legitimacy of the law, in a proceedural sense, with the help of more than just the Nazis. 

The original point that started this element of the discussion implied that the Nazis singlehandedly seized power and declared themselves dictators, or with Hitler as a dictator. More like a coup d'etat than the soft kind of dictatorship that developed in reality, and which is similar to what Putin or Erdogan are using today. 

I was just trying to point out the differences in how that happened. 

If you wanted to argue that Nazis were not legitimate, there's no need to fixate on the Enabling Act to come to that conclusion, and no need for us to keep hammering away at these finer, less important to the overall narrative, details.

http://www.alternet.org/economy/noam-chomsky-austerity-just-class-war

&gt; What’s going on with the austerity is really class war. As an economic program, austerity, under recession, makes no sense. It just makes the situation worse. So the Greek debt, relative to GDP, has actually gone up during the period of—which is—well, the policies that are supposed to overcome the debt. In the case of Spain, the debt was not a public debt, it was private debt. It was the actions of the banks. And that means also the German banks. Remember, when a bank makes a dangerous, a risky borrowing, somebody is making a risky lending. And the policies that are designed by the troika, you know, are basically paying off the banks, the perpetrators, much like here. The population is suffering. But one of the things that’s happening is that the—you know, the social democratic policies, so-called welfare state, is being eroded. That’s class war. It’s not an economic policy that makes any sense as to end a serious recession. And there is a reaction to it—Greece, Spain and some in Ireland, growing elsewhere, France. But it’s a very dangerous situation, could lead to a right-wing response, very right-wing. The alternative to Syriza might be Golden Dawn, neo-Nazi party.

The SA did not have legal authority to do what they did. The parliament, after the SA did what they did, had the legal authority.

In Computer Science, we call that a privilege escalation vulnerability, and every judge in the world would rule you hacked yourself into the system illegally, not accessing it as authorised.

Everyone who was involved in that stuff should've been arrested for treason, at least assumption of office, illegal imprisonment etc... but, then, well, the people with the legal power to do that were the ones who ordered those actions. That's more or less the exact definition of a putsch.

Less legally and more politically speaking, the whole thing was to give Nazi rule the *air* of legitimacy. Had they not done it they'd have lost further votes in the next elections, leading to even more complex putsch mechanics (which they no doubt would have at least attempted).

Of course, the second democratic German constitution fixed that vulnerability.

&gt; less important to the overall narrative

There's a huge difference in narrative between ""the Nazis were elected to power"" and ""The way to power was a paramilitary one"".

Heck, even the parliament we are talking about was elected under the SA's thumb: There was *massive* terror and voter intimidation.

The state was dysfunctional at that time, however, without the terror democratic forces could've pulled it back.

Without the SA, the NSDAP would have been nothing. Take the RFB away from the KPD and not much would've changed, they were largely defensive. And by equating them you'd be in the same league as people who nowadays say ""Well the Antifa is just as bad as boneheads"".

So, yes, all this *is* bloody important for the narrative.

And believe it or not, such things are important for Germans. You might remember that at the beginning, I was telling you that mentioning the Nazi past is not taboo, but that it's generally done cluelessly. Noone is blaming Greeks for a singe thing the military Junta or some inbred Noble did.

The Sainte Chapelle closes at 6 pm every day, (I think after six it's booked visitations only) and Orsay closes at 6pm too (and has late opening on thursdays: 9:45pm). All museums of Paris are closed one day per week (mondays or tuesdays, depending on the museum).

If it can do anything other than call in the loans, then it needs to consider doing so *now*. 

Otherwise, this bankrun that is only being slowed down by capital controls, is going to mandate Greece to print drachma anyway. And voters have to think that when they go into the booths--despite the fact the referendum is about something else. 

So just like in every other situation, doing nothing is choice too. Sitting back and watching is equivalent in that respect to calling in the loans and causing a panic that starts default and ends in drachma. It's just slower, but no less certain.

&gt;[W]e seem to be repeating the mistakes and this is why I believe that we need to think different, we need a change in the logic, we need a radically new direction to reframe the negotiations with Greece.
&gt;
&gt;My proposal is the following: Greece should get no more new financing from the EU or the IMF but it should get a generous maturity extension and significant nominal debt reduction from the official sector (OSI). Insisting on a frontloaded fiscal adjustment in the current economic environment is both economically and politically irresponsible. Providing more assistance to simply repay existing official creditors is simply inane.
&gt;
&gt; The Eurogroup had committed in November 2012 to take the necessary steps to ensure Greece’s debt sustainability. Now is the time to deliver on this constructively ambiguous promise. The IMF should do the same and ensure that all the repayments due in the coming two years are effectively rolled over or refinanced by the remaining funds left in the program. I do know the institutional problems raised by this proposal but they have to be overcome.
&gt; 
&gt; This would free Greece from any of its obligations to the official sector in the coming two years but it would still be faced with a hard budget constraint. Having no access to markets and receiving no new financing from the EU or the IMF it will have to balance its budget  alone. The Greeks will need to make tough fiscal choices but they would make them on their own. To achieve this, the Government would have to start collecting taxes and confronting the oligarchy, the vested interests and the deep State that are sapping its formidable potential. [..]
&gt; 
&gt; This is not guaranteed to work. It may still fail if the Greek authorities are too timid or too captured to change but it is worth trying because the alternatives are worse.

Maybe. Not certain. And maybe if the assassination attempt on Hitler had succeeded, things would have been different. Or if appeasment of the Sudetenland hadn't been offered and confrontation thus occurred sooner. 

There's a ton of 'what ifs' we could countenance.

I made the point a post back where I sad I wasn't trying ever to render a verdict of the overall legality or legitimacy of the Nazi regime. I was instead talking about how legitimate instruments of state were used to proceedurally enable it. And that the 'disfunction' of the state was apparent by how lots of people were acting well before Hitler became dictator. 

We don't disagree about that.

Saying that the Reichstag passed the legislation, and that politically it was not a coup d'etat doesn't mean the overall result was legitimate--a law like the Enabling Act or the Patriot Act in America can be viewed as illegitimate or unconstitutional simply because of what they *do*.

You are fixated on the mechanism of how it got passed--on the lack of a proper quora and the intimidation of parliamentarians etc--as the reason it wasn't legitimate. I tried to tell you that this wasn't necessary, all you have to do is look at what it enabled the Nazis to do to understand it was an illegitimate thing. 

But for me it's important to know that it occurred within the realm of legitimate lawmaking, and of the same tools. Nobody threw out the appearance of having law, they just bent and broke the system to get what they wanted. 

&gt; Without the SA, the NSDAP would have been nothing. Take the RFB away from the KPD and not much would've changed, they were largely defensive.

I don't see how this contradicts anything I've said. I've been maintaining that NSDAP couldn't have gotten into power ever without help. Even in 1933 they didn't have enough seats to do it.

&gt; So, yes, all this is bloody important for the narrative.

Of the narrative or proving the illegitimacy of the Nazis through their manipulation of the system, and by a parliamentarian reign of terror--yes important to that. But that's not the subject centre we're discussing. And to that subject--the moral position of Germany at the end of WWII and Greece today--it *is* a secondary consideration to the narrative. 

&gt; I was telling you that mentioning the Nazi past is not taboo, but that it's generally done cluelessly.

You can blame for this if you like... But we're so far off the discussion on a tangent that we're no longer even really connected to where we started. It's hard to approach the 'intelligent' referencing of the Nazi party when how such relates to the subject matter is slowly changing, and sub-details of the story come to take on more significance as it progresses. 

We are miles away now from where we started. I do respect your opinion, but this wasn't part of what we set out discussing. And honestly, I do enjoy it. Your knowledge of pre-WWII politics is better than mine.

This is not going to be a popular comment, but ""can't be afforded"" is relative. 

You're from the Netherlands, right? I'm Dutch too, originally. And the big fight that's been dominating in Dutch politics lately is about tax reform, with the government parties proposing a package of tax cuts, and a (sort-of-) opposition party like D66 arguing - if I've understood it correctly - that the reform should be larger and more long-term, including deeper tax cuts for e.g. capital/corporations.

So, OK. It feels a bit shrill to say, to paraphrase things a bit: 'sorry Greece, we can't possibly afford to forgive or suspend any of your crippling debt payments, or a more investment/growth-focused European economic policy in general - the money is just not there.

You were the one starting to mention the RFB, which is whataboutism and, narratively, takes blame off the Nazis.

&gt; the moral position of Germany at the end of WWII and Greece today

Is not the same, specifically because:

1. One government was democratically legitimised, the other wasn't.
2. As already mentioned, the concrete budget as implemented was completely different, at least in the beginning. 

Not acknowledging those two things is shifting blame. Without owning up to them, you can't simultaneously admit that Greece did fuck up, under the people's mandate, and was in the process of fucking up further, still under people's mandate.

Germany was in the opposite position: It just finished fucking up royally -- without the people's mandate -- and the whole world loved the new government in charge and their policies were imminently sensible. This time, with the people's mandate.

The outlook was a completely different one.


&gt;  but this wasn't part of what we set out discussing.

I don't know what *you* set out to be discussing, but I was always coming back to it: That the two situations aren't comparable. How many detours *you* have to go and how much you have to learn about German history to understand that, though, I don't know.

You could also accept it, and rest in the knowledge that whether Greece shall be helped or not is *not* contingent on that question. Why should it be? 

I wouldn't, today, advocate to forgive any of Greece's debt: Instead, extend its term, no debt payments, for starters, for two years but have a decade if you want. That gives breathing room to enact reform while simultaneously rebuilding the economy, and doing so builds the trust needed for everything else. *Then* Greece would be in Germany's post-WWII situation, at least very, very, very roughly.",null,0,null,1435887341,null,0,false,0,csqjl15,null,t3_3bv5cm,null,t1_csqjl15,null,t1_csqj2cz,null,null,null,1440503122,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

I liked this explanation of how that worked - it's a bit technical, but still plain enough to follow. And it's not from some lefty activist, it's [from an American investment banker](http://www.cnbc.com/id/102799368):

&gt; The northern Europeans, on the other hand, were outright enablers of Greek excess. Not only did they aggressively seek to provide loans to Greece during the bubble era (through their private banking sectors and the bond markets), but in what can only be seen historically as a panicked response to preserve the euro system, the euro group (through the European Central Bank and its individual country central banks), together with the International Monetary Fund, bailed out European banks and the bond market by socializing Greece's bad debt and placing taxpayers throughout the euro zone at risk of sharing the losses thereon.
&gt; 
&gt; Why would the banks and bond buyers of northern Europe have lent money to Greece in the first place? Or, for that matter, to housing speculators in Spain, to banks in Ireland or to the governments of Italy and Portugal?
&gt; 
&gt; The answer is that the structure of the incomplete European monetary union gave them strong incentive to do so. After all, with substantial excess wealth and a resistance to inflating their own economies through internal spending, the euro regime itself encouraged trade-surplus countries such as Germany and the Netherlands to lend to their weaker brethren in order to bolster the peripheral countries' ability to import even more of the surplus nations' production (to the increasing benefit of the latter and the eventual implosion of the former). And they were able to do so in a common currency, without the risk of currency devaluation by borrowers.
&gt; 
&gt; This was mercantilism writ large and was without precedent in modern economic history, as there is no mechanism in the EMU to resolve the resulting imbalances and the captive peripheral countries had relinquished their ability to address the imbalances by adjusting exchange rates. And yet the credit providers expected — and still expect — to get their money back.

I doubt that the creditor countries and institutions would suddenly have abandoned their long-held and structurally-rooted positions on the need for austerity and repayments if only the Greek Minister of Finance had been better skilled at diplomacy, but it might have helped on the edges.

But the whole European policy debacle around Greece was much more affected, going back years already, by the fact that it was in part governed by people like Schäuble with their accountant-type understanding of economics. Sony Kapoor [took note of this](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2015/07/01/why-greece-never-got-a-fair-chance/):

&gt; Despite having experienced an angry German government almost push Greece out of the Eurozone in 2012 at first hand, I never thought we would be standing at this crossroads again. It took many of us – advisers, EU technocrats, American politicians and some academics – several weeks to convince the key-decision makers in Berlin not to pull the trigger [..]. In the end Chancellor Merkel took a fateful decision to overrule the finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble, who remained unconvinced.
&gt; 
&gt; Living through this process was hell not least because economic arguments, financial calculations and political scenarios are not ideal for changing the minds of often-ideological lawyers that form the core of the German financial policymaking community. For them it was less about the economics and more about rules and morality. [..]
&gt; 
&gt; The initial financial terms offered to Greece were rather onerous, the conditions attached far too prescriptive and the pace of fiscal adjustment too much, as the IMF badly underestimated the impact of austerity on the economy.

It's easy to come up with ideal suggestions when taking economies out of context; but in the end that money is owned by people, and that means politics. And I think Varoufakis, just like Krugman, came from this academic background, totally underestimating (or worse, not grasping) the political aspect.",null,0,null,1435893368,null,0,false,0,csqmmbr,null,t3_3bvq0b,null,t1_csqmmbr,null,t1_csqk7ch,null,null,null,1437542717,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

Nobody forced them to become moderators in the first place and reddit's financing (reddit gold) can work without the them since this is done person-to-person. The fact that admins let them out to dry is a sign that they know how things worked before or what they'd want that to happen in the first place.

&gt;Why exactly should mods put up with that?

Why exactly should users put up with their tantrum, after they decided on themselves to become mods? Look at our moderating team in here, do you think somebody forced them to become moderators? I think &amp; believe not. Why should they block my access to r/Europe? Just because they feel like it? Ffs smh...

No, those moderators right now are showing the muscles they wouldn't have if the reddit administrators didn't made them (or their colleagues before them) moderators. This is flexing muscles without a reason, while making our time on reddit restricted &amp; limited: they're using us, not aiding us.

here's a declaration I am trying to get in order 

---

Why has the blackout happened?

The key points we would like to say are 

1) Whilst this protest initial began because of the dismissal of Victoria from the administration team, it is not the primary cause, it is merely the straw that broke the camel’s back

2) We feel as though reddit’s communication with moderators as well as with the wider community, has been lacking. This is exemplified by the fact that Victoria was one of the few admins who regularly communicated with moderators. Subs such as /r/IAMA relied on her to help facilitate their AMAs, and the fact she was dismissed without notice is not only an insult, given that reddit has poorly communicated its decision to dismiss a major communicator, but has also lead to many AMAs needing to be cancelled, which could have been avoided simply by forewarning

3) We love reddit. We love the community and the functions it provides. That’s why we moderate. We give up our free time to do this out of a sense of fun and a desire to do something good; to make and facilitate the growth of communities we love. We wish reddit no harm. We wish it every prosperity.

4) However we feel unable to do this due to the lacking communication of the administrators during times of crisis, which they can easily fix (e.g. brigading and removal of alternative accounts). And the tools we are given in order to fulfil our function as custodians of the communities is hindered by the fact that we have such limited tools to do that. 

5) We are protesting to draw attention to this. Many moderators feel unable to accurately do our job because of these conditions, and we want the wider reddit community to know that, and we want the admins to fix that. This is a plea for reddit. This is a protest to draw attention. Mods are often criticised, but we are forced usually into the actions we take because of our severely limited resources.  

6) There’s two ways this can be fixed: either, the admins give us the powers to run these subreddits effectively, or create a layer of community admins who can deal with moderator requests (or a mixture of the two)
We have provided a list of recommendations (and that’s all these are) below.

7) We would also like to announce pre-emptively that we know the administrators “are working on” these tools, but if that is indeed the case, then we would at least appreciate a genuine progress report, and insight into how far it is actually going a long.

Yet despite this guys like you will throw a tantrum just because they just want some dialogue to occur. Look at it from their perspective for once, it looks like you let your negative view on mods cloud your perspective. 


Even if they do this for willingly, it doesn't mean admins get to treat them like shit. 


Also your point about reddit gold is irrelevant, if there were no mods reddit would become a shit show, and users would leave in droves to the next website, which would obviously destroy their revenue stream.

The Americans and Canadians would drag their heels, as they would not want to get into a war for the region and without the US it is difficult to say if NATO would come to the aid of a non-treaty member, EU nation or not. 

Sweden is neutral because it is in a highly vulnerable position to Russian aggression. Russia can swing wide and send in forces from the North, including insurgent elements. It can essentially choke the Nordic Nations from its Naval positions in Murmansk and Kaliningrad. But at the same time Sweden cannot join NATO, fear of reprisals from Russia could have grave consequences, as Russia has clearly stated time and again. 

Russia has done far more, Lets not forget it took a chunk of Georgia in 2008. Now, its splintered Ukraine into two states, and lets be clear here, the Ukraine as we knew it is lost. It has been cut in two and it no longer functions as a single entity, Russia has taken half the damn thing for itself, and we got caught with our pants down, Russia made the EU look stupid and got away with it in our own backyard.

Like it or not the EU looks weak and Russia might exploit this, Russia is not stupid enough to fight NATO directly, the Americans have moved alot of Metal into the Baltic to make sure of this.

This might surprise you but for us, the regular users, isn't in our interest to know what they go through. Many users, myself included, do not care. It's as simple as that. It isn't an obligation to know what other users go through since they accepted that kind of responsibility.  

Nobody forced to become moderators, nobody will force them to resign from moderating. As simple as that. No subreddit that exists in reddit doesn't belong to them. They simply volunteered to become moderators to their subreddits... nothing... more... and I don't care about their decision in becoming a moderator.

&gt;That's what reddit would look like without no mods.

For that, I'm also curious how reddit looked like without moderators. Sadly, I'm a tad late for that, aren't I. 

&gt;Yet despite this guys like you will throw a tantrum because they just want some dialogue to occur.

Yet, despite all of this, nobody forced them to become moderators. I'll repeat this as many times as I have to, if you're not willing to understand.

&gt;Look at it from their perspective for once, it looks like you let your negative view on mods cloud your perspective.

I do not care about their perspective because I didn't forced them to become moderators. It's their responsibility &amp; hardship to bear, not mine or yours or any other user like us.  

&gt;Even if they do this for willingly, it doesn't mean admins get to treat them like whit.

Then, they should surrender the position, as moderator, and let somebody else more able to occupy if they can't handle it. They're ""outside their jurisdiction"" with this kind of blocking and they're blackmailing the administrators for something they didn't do... for once...

null,false,donheart,EURO,null,null,"By ROBERT D. KAPLAN Updated June 30, 2015 7:40 p.m. ET 240 COMMENTS Geopolitics can be more important than economics. Just look at Greece. On purely economic grounds, Greece should never have been admitted to the European Union in 1981 and might have been ejected from the eurozone months ago.


But what many European policy makers know—even if few articulate it—is that Europe will be increasingly vulnerable to Russian aggression if its links to Greece are substantially loosened. Greece is the only part of the Balkans accessible on several seaboards to the Mediterranean, and thus is a crucial gateway to and from the West.



Opinion Journal Video Center for a New American Security Senior Fellow Robert Kaplan on the geopolitics behind Greece’s economic woes. Photo credit: Getty Images. Given the bellicosity of Russian President Vladimir Putin, it is useful to contemplate what would have happened had Stalin not ceded Greece to the West in return for the rest of the Balkans at the start of the Cold War. With Greece inside the Communist bloc, Italy would have been permanently endangered, to say nothing of the whole eastern Mediterranean and the Levant. Indeed, American bases in Greece were critical to the policy of containment.




But Greece, in terms of its politics and culture, is not fully anchored in the West. Greece is more properly viewed as the child of Byzantine and Ottoman despotism than of Periclean Athens. The mid-19th century revolutions in Europe were often of bourgeois origins with political liberties as their goal. Yet the Greek independence movement was more of an ethnic movement with a religious basis. Greece, by virtue of its Eastern Orthodox Christianity, has an emotional and spiritual bond with Russia. This helps explain why most Greeks sided with Russia in favor of the Serbs and against Europe during the 1999 Kosovo War, even if the Greek government’s position was more equivocal.



Greece never had modern political parties to the degree of Central and Western Europe. Greek parties have been largely paternalistic, coffeehouse fiefs organized around charismatic individuals, featuring a reactionary-style right-wing movement and a radical-style left-wing movement. Andreas Papandreou, Greece’s prime minister for much of the 1980s and ’90s, was never a modern European socialist, as many in the West in the 1980s believed. Rather, as I know from living in Athens during that decade, he is better understood as a Latin-American style populist in the tradition of Juan Perón.



Greece never had modern political parties to the degree of Central and Western Europe. Greek parties have been largely paternalistic, coffeehouse fiefs organized around charismatic individuals, featuring a reactionary-style right-wing movement and a radical-style left-wing movement. Andreas Papandreou, Greece’s prime minister for much of the 1980s and ’90s, was never a modern European socialist, as many in the West in the 1980s believed. Rather, as I know from living in Athens during that decade, he is better understood as a Latin-American style populist in the tradition of Juan Perón.




The newspaper with the largest circulation and influence in Greece during the Papandreou era was the left-wing Ethnos (the Nation), which had suspected links to the Soviet intelligence services. The Soviets found it easier to operate in Greece than perhaps in any other NATO country. Greece during the Cold War was never comfortable inside NATO, and instead yearned for a dreamy, nebulous neutrality. NATO and the EU kept Greece free and prosperous, unlike the other states of the Balkans, but Greeks, having never experienced life inside the Warsaw Pact, were never grateful for being kept out of it.



All this is prologue to the rise of Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and his hard-left Syriza party. Because modern conservatism and modern socialism only arrived in Greece toward the end of the 20th century, they were quickly swept aside for the hard left and fascist right (the Golden Dawn party) once the economy imploded in recent years. Given the Kremlin’s long-standing relationships in Greece, it is conceivable that the Russians now have better ties with—and intelligence on—Syriza and its various factions than the Europeans do.



Russia may be helping to inflame Syriza’s internal divisions in the hope that Greece’s ruling party cannot make the difficult concessions necessary to stay in the eurozone. If Greece does leave the eurozone, the economic aftershocks to the domestic economy could reduce it to a semi-failed state that, along with the dismemberment and weakening of Ukraine, will seriously weaken Europe’s geopolitical position vis-à-vis Russia.
If this happens not only will the Iberian states of Spain and Portugal be more susceptible to euro-debt contagion, but Balkan states with weak institutions and fragile economies like Albania, Bulgaria and Romania will be in a more exposed position. While those states were never part of the eurozone, the spectacle of a major Balkan country pivotally loosening its ties with the West, even as Russia appears momentarily ascendant in the region, will be sobering in the extreme.



Then there is the larger picture. The first post-Cold War decades featured a secure Eurasian maritime sphere from the Mediterranean across the Indian Ocean to the Western Pacific. Thus, the weakening of Greece’s ties with the West in the eastern Mediterranean has to be seen alongside the ascendancy of Iran in the Persian Gulf and the rise of China in the South and East China seas as a singular process in the chipping away at American power.



The EU, as frustrating as its policies can be, represents the ultimate triumph of American power emerging from the bloodshed of World War II. If Greece does leave the eurozone, whatever the country’s sins, it is demonstrably in Europe’s and America’s interest to nurse it back to health to keep, for example, Russian warships away from Greek ports. Greece, whether with the euro or the drachma, is in need of nation-building. Europe, after all, to be true to its own values, must give hope and succor to its periphery.

The site and domain doesn't belong to them or us, for that matter. The fact that reddit's execs aren't asking us for a monthly fee, just because we're registered here, is enough as a good bargain as it is. r/FatPeopleHate (since this is a popular example) used to be a subreddit as well, created by guys, maintained, and continued to be moderated 'till it was teared up by red tape. The moderators didn't paid monthly fees, the users didn't paid monthly fees and it was a public subreddit. 

Secondly, some subreddits, from what I've observed (or at least misobserved) is that they weren't created by a guy or a group of guys; they were created as a default (I believe). For example, it doesn't say who created r/Europe, however, it does say who created r/UpliftingNews. Still, it doesn't matter who created a subreddit/community. If it's public domain and the creator or moderators don't pay fee, they're just as well responsible to give up the position when they can't handle any more the responsibilites as moderators. When they restrict access for normal users, no matter what problems they have, they're accountable to the bone.

And, if you weren't able to see it by now, reddit is as good as we, the users, maintain it as such. The intervention of moderators can cause abusive action; some as calling it authoritarian or dictatorial. 

For examples, what these guys are doing here (https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bxjyu/list_of_subreddits_suddenly_going_private/), I call it dictatorial. Why? Because they're restricting my access to free subreddits meant to be public, as a hissy fit against the administrators. 

&gt;You're trivialising all the work that mods put into their subreddits, treating them as replaceable users is hilariously inaccurate and just a bit inconsiderate towards the mods that genuinely care and out time into moderating their subreddits.

I don't shed tears for those who volunteer (it nearly rhymed). One, they bear the responsibilities they accepted for themselves and, Two, since they accepted it, it's their hardship on their own free will. Just because they offered their spare time to overwatch us, I should be grateful? Don't make me giggle. It's all arbitrary; reddit is as good as we, the regular users, make it so; I wrote it a bit earlier.  

&gt;You may not care about it now, but when all the hardworking mods that actually give a fuck leave reddit, I'm pretty sure you'll care then.

I don't share syriza's logic on the matter and personally I'm gonna vote for yes.

Having said that, I lost any trust to what the IMF says, years ago.
It is known that from the very start many inside the IMF disagreed on the IMF proposals exactly for that reason: that the proposed programs would not be viable and that they'd save private banks and not Greece. There are many references and articles about that.

Many economists mainly from the US and UK pointed that without a debt cut the programs aren't viable without the debt cut. They've done so years ago.
This is a German made documentary about it. It is very eye opening and I think it's good to see it.  
If you don't want to see it all you can skip to around 7:35 and see what IMF board members say on the matter and how at the start of the programs they had objections about it for the reasons we are talking here:

The fact that reddit's execs aren't asking us for a monthly fee, just because we're registered here, is enough as a good bargain as it is. r/FatPeopleHate (since this is a popular example) used to be a subreddit as well, created by guys, maintained, and continued to be moderated 'till it was teared up by red tape. The moderators didn't paid monthly fees, the users didn't paid monthly fees and it was a public subreddit.


I'm not arguing for a legal perspective, I'm saying that if all the mods stepped down, reddit would become a complete disaster. They don't own it, but that's irrelevant.


&gt;weren't able to see it by now, reddit is as good as we, the users, maintain it as such. The intervention of moderators can cause abusive action; some as calling it authoritarian or dictatorial.


Moderators aren't separate from us, they are users just like us, so you shouldn't act like they're a separate entity as well.


&gt;I don't shed tears for those who volunteer. One, they bear the responsibilities they accepted for themselves and, Two, since they accepted it, it's their hardship on their own free will. Just because they offered their spare time to overwatch us, I should be grateful? Don't make me giggle. It's all arbitrary.

I'm not saying you should shed tears for them, I'm just saying you should be considerate and understand the difficult position the admins are putting the mods in.


&gt;Nah, I'm pretty sure other people will take their place. If not, there's always the administrators to take care things themselves.

Yeah mods can technically be replaced, but the way admins treat mods makes me think that they will eventually drive away all the people that care about the community, and believe me, you don't want that. 




Also you're avoiding my main point:


Why do you think a few subs going down for a few days is so oppressive to you? These guys put in a tremendous amount of work day in day out, so don't you think they deserve a little bit of feedback from the admins? Seems pretty selfish of you to attack mods because you can't go on certain subreddits for a few days.

Victoria était *la* personne qui faisait fonctionner aussi bien les AMA de gens suffisamment célèbres, la goutte d'huile (voire la bouteille) indispensable à leur succès. C'était elle qui gérait toute la partie planification des AMA, le calendrier, qui s'assurait qu'il n'y avait pas de conflit, que les dates convenaient bien à tout le monde. C'était elle qui était le contact presque permanent entre les mods des divers subs qui faisaient des AMA et les gens qui faisaient des AMA ou leurs agents. C'était elle qui se retrouvait aux côtés de la célébrité en question, qui expliquait le fonctionnement du site, qui les aidait à comprendre l'interface, qui lisait les questions les plus populaires et tapait les réponses à la volée (et à toute vitesse, et en rendant assez bien les pauses et les hésitations de son interlocuteur). C'était elle qui s'assurait que les questions difficiles n'étaient pas ignorées (sans forcément obtenir de réponse, quand ça veut pas, ça veut pas). C'était elle qui s'assurait que c'était bien la célébrité qui répondait, sans interférence d'un agent de relations publiques voire d'une équipe entière. (Et oui, d'après certains mods, elle a arrêté des AMA à cause de ça.) C'était elle qui était en contact avec les mods pendant les AMA, un lien indispensable quand quelque chose partait de travers. Elle était à temps plein sur ce travail, elle en avait plus de 2 000 AMA à son compteur, pour /r/IAmA, mais aussi pour /r/books, /r/movies, etc.

Ce que je dis là, c'est ce que les mods de /r/IAmA ont dit hier soir sur /r/OutOfTheLoop. (Mais avant de savoir tout cela, j'avais bien remarqué que tous les grands AMA étaient accompagnés d'une phrase genre ""Victoria est avec moi pour aider à ce que tout se passe bien"".)

Victoria a été virée brutalement, sans avoir prévenu qui que ce soit, sans avoir planifié la moindre période de transition, sans avoir embauché ou nommé quelqu'un pour lui succéder. Plusieurs AMA importants ont dû être annulés, sur /r/OutOfTheLoop un agent (d'un écrivain je crois) venait expliquer comment il avait eu énormément de mal à savoir ce qu'il se passait, que son client était sur le point de prendre son avion et qu'il devait savoir s'il maintenait son vol, etc. Victoria a même proposé de faire l'AMA quand même (bénévolement !) pour qu'il n'y ait pas trop de gêne…

On ne sait pas pourquoi Victoria a été virée aussi sec. Certains soupçonnent l'AMA désastreux de l'influent et controversé [Jesse Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Jackson) (lien anglais car la page française est assez pauvre), qui s'est tenu la veille, d'avoir été la cause. D'autres se demandent si le fait que Victoria était assez intransigeante sur le fait que les AMA étaient faits par les personnalités elles-mêmes, et pas par des équipes de relations publiques, n'ait joué en sa défaveur. C'était également la dernière employée de Reddit à ne pas avoir déménagé sur la côte ouest, elle était encore à New York. Enfin, il est tout à fait possible que l'administration de Reddit n'ait pas compris à quel point elle avait un rôle essentiel dans la réussite des AMA.

Bref, c'est un exemple frappant de la très mauvaise gestion de Reddit.

Quand j'ai découvert tout ça hier soir, le seul sub fermé était /r/IAmA, pour des raisons purement pratiques (ils devaient annuler ou réorganiser tous leurs AMA prévus à court terme, et c'était le moyen le plus efficace de montrer à des gens qui connaissent très mal Reddit que quelque chose ne marchait pas comme prévu). Dans la discussion sur /r/OutOfTheLoop, d'autres subs très affectés (/r/movies, /r/books) se demandaient s'ils n'allaient pas aussi se fermer.

Manifestement pendant la nuit, le phénomène a explosé, et ce sont maintenant des dizaines voire centaines de subs importants (cf. le live thread) qui se sont mis en mode privé.",null,0,null,1435901329,null,0,false,0,csqqe2k,null,t3_3bxspm,null,t1_csqqe2k,null,t1_csqjacu,null,null,null,1437545773,null,49,false,france,t5_2qhjz,49,null

null,false,Spermezan,ROMA,România,null,"&gt; I'm not arguing for a legal perspective, I'm saying that if all the mods stepped down, reddit would become a complete disaster. They don't own it, but that's irrelevant.

You and I both weren't here when there were just the administrators to handle everything. This is a viable option to keep in mind.

&gt;Moderators aren't separate from us, they are users just like us, so you shouldn't act like they're a separate entity as well.

First among equals in the subreddit or subreddits they moderate. They are a separate entity depending on circumstance. If they joined just to fulfill a fantasy of monitoring/controlling or if they have a bad day/stomach ache...

&gt;I'm not saying you should shed tears for them, I'm just saying you should be considerate and understand the difficult position the admins are putting the mods in.

If they truly were bothered by the administrators, the moderators could, as easily, give up and let reddit become a cesspool. That way, they could've reach a deal. But, no, of course not, that's too smart or considerate for your fellow users who want to relax and laugh on reddit. Instead, they decided to throw a hissy fit by blocking me and others. 

&gt;Yeah mods can technically be replaced, but the way admins treat mods makes me think that they will eventually drive away all the people that care about the community, and believe me, you don't want that.

Voat has seizures. It'll be a long way untill it's fully operational at the same level reddit is and there aren't any options left, apart from certain forums that cannot compete with reddit. The level of depency many people have makes it impossible to lose. When they did that shakedown with those other subreddits, reddit didn't suffered nor lost numbers. Sure, people were pissed but they still hanged around here. After all of this, the administrators could issue an apology to the users, like us, but won't spare the moderator teams who decided themselves to block users from subreddits.

&gt;Also you're avoiding my main point:

&gt;Why do you think a few subs going down for a few days is so oppressive to you? 

I pay for the internet and reddit is presented as a free domain that doesn't require monthly fees to relax or laugh or inform myself on different topics (if we exclude the reddit gold). The idea of moderators, that asked themselves to become moderators, deciding to block something that is entirely based on their own accord isn't right nor acceptable. 


&gt;These guys put in a tremendous amount of work day in day out, so don't you think they deserve a little bit of feedback from the admins? 

Not all of them and those, who did the work, did so on their own free will &amp; time. 

&gt;Seems pretty selfish of you to attack mods because you can't go on certain subreddits for a few days.

I'm no more selfish than them being hypocrite and egotistical to the administrators'/execs' decisions. When they did that red tape with those subreddits, they didn't had a problem with it. Suddenly, when they think or feel it's about them, the apocalypse must come down because they have the local power the administrators granted them, or their predecessors, which, otherwise, they wouldn't have had it on their own.",null,0,null,1435901358,null,0,1435901667,0,csqqeiu,null,t3_3bxvz8,null,t1_csqqeiu,null,t1_csqon9b,null,null,null,1437545774,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

The bloody rules are indeed the problem. The euro is a corrosive acid that is eating away the bonds that brought Europe together after WWII. And many economists predicted exactly what would happen many years ago. 

http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-euro--monetary-unity-to-political-disunity?utm_content=bufferadfbe&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer

http://www.lrb.co.uk/v14/n19/wynne-godley/maastricht-and-all-that 

Yes, Greece didn't follow the rules, as many others, including Germany. Yes, Greece has been unusually corrupt and inefficient. But at the end of day, it doesn't matter. This was the case for the last 50 years and Greece didn't go bankrupt. 

Simply put, the euro magnifies fiscal shocks and restricts the ability of a country to deal with them via monetary policies. Too warm for some countries, too cold for others, never right. Without a fiscal union, with fiscal stabilizers such social security, federal infrastructure investments, federal unemployment, and so on, a common currency is a folly of the greatest magnitude. 

I don't believe that the European leaders that put it together were dumb. They were something worse, idealists. They genuinely believed that when the fiscal shocks came, the European countries would come even closer and deal in mature way. Having seen the horrors of WWII, having stared the soviet threat and seen its demise, they dared to dream bigger dreams. And in those dreams, they could not have imagined how puny and inadequate to the european challenges their successors would end up being.

null,false,Luett_un_Luett,null,null,null,"&gt; «Nichts ist gefährlicher als eine Idee, wenn man nur eine hat», schrieb der französische Philosoph Alain. Schon deshalb ist Austerität eine gefährliche Idee. Sie ist das einzige politische Projekt, das ­Europa hat.


&gt; Selten haben so zahlreiche Regierungschefs quer durch Länder und Parteien so einig auf dieselbe Karte gesetzt. Für die Sparpolitik riskieren sie Milliarden, ihr Gesicht, die Zukunft ihres Landes. Und das ohne Reserve. Als die griechische Regierung über Alternativen sprechen wollte, prallte sie gegen eine Wand. Am Ende stand es 18:1. Und der deutsche Finanzminister Wolfgang Schäuble fragte, wer wohl auf dem richtigen Kurs sei. Das eine Auto oder die 18 Autos in der Gegenrichtung.


&gt; Kein Zweifel, Austerität ist die wichtigste politische Idee der Gegenwart. Das Erschreckende daran ist: Es ist eine Idee, die keine Theorie im Rücken hat, keine nachweisbaren Erfolge zeigt, dafür aber direkt zur grössten politischen Katastrophe des letzten Jahrhunderts führte.

Dando per scontato che le forze dell'ordine debbano sempre essere messere in grado di identificare i cittadini, la carta d'identità è uno strumento per farlo.

In giro per l'Europa ci sono posti in cui la cartà d'identità è un di più (tra cui l'Italia credo), altri in cui non devi portarla a presso ma devi essere in grado di fornirla a breve su richiesta (come diventerà in spagna) e altri in cui devi invece portarla con te.

&gt;__Ludovico di Varthema__, also known as __Barthema__ and __Vertomannus__ (c. 1470 – 1517), was an [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy) traveller, diarist and aristocrat known for being the first non-Muslim European to enter [Mecca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca) as a [pilgrim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj). Nearly everything that is known about his life comes from his own account of his travels, *Itinerario de Ludouico de Varthema Bolognese,* published in Rome in 1510.

If the numbers are to big for us, we have to rely on experts, so the only way to know if we have to be scared at the moment is the media coverage, which isn't so negative about it after all, I see a lot of ""We had it worse"", ""this will not have much of an impact"" and so on. *I'm not saying they're unfailable, but this is what we have.*

L'utente in questione è stato shadowbannato, tanto per ribadire che in questo momento l'amministrazione di reddit non ha idea di quello che sta facendo e proprio non riesce a non far infuriare l'utenza.

As far as what they look like, everyone had their own room (private room) but shared the apartment with another or two. A small kitchen with mini-fridge, sink, stove, shelves. Bathroom with shower, toilet, mirror. Rooms had a bed, desk, and wardrobe. (Closets are not really a thing here haha)

They seemed pretty secure. Front door always locked and your friends could buzz your name outside and you could open the front door from your room.

I have to say that I really really enjoyed living in my apartment. It was in a cool old building in a fun part of town. All my roommates were German and it was great hanging out with them and their friends. We did regular apartment dinners, had parties, and went out biking and adventuring a lot together. You might get that in the dorms but when visiting my friends in the dooms, most said they rarely even talked to their roommates. I guess it is just luck either way.

Feel free to message me if you ever have any questions about Leipzig or anything else really. =)

Pour te répondre vite fait sur quelques points :

&gt;Toutes ces citées de polonais a plus de 40 % de chomage.

Si l'État n'avait pas parqué les immigrés dans des ghettos, et en plus dans des immeubles dont on savait qu'ils deviendraient vétustes en vingt ans, les choses n'auraient sans doute pas été les mêmes.

&gt;La discrimination a l'embauche contre les polonais.

En quoi c'est de la faute des immigrés si on les discrimine à l'embauche, exactement ?

&gt;Les polonais qui sifflent La Marseillaise

Je connais des tas de Français qui en feraient autant. Et moi aussi. (À moins que je ne compte pas comme Français, puisque je suis un immigré de deuxième génération...)

&gt;La viande polonaise dans les cantines.

C'est un régime spécial. Personne d'autre n'a jamais été obligé d'en bouffer. S'ils veulent se conformer à un régime spécial, pourquoi ne pas leur en offrir la possibilité ? On fait bien des régimes végétariens et des régimes adaptés pour les allergiques, non ? C'est pareil : ceux qui en veulent en prennent et le reste s'en fout.     
Et tu sais que si tu as, dans les choix, du poisson le vendredi dans tous les selfs de France, c'est *aussi* pour des raisons religieuses.   
(En plus tu mélanges origines maghrébines et islam allègrement.)

&gt;Les horaires de piscine pour les femmes polonaises qui refusent de serrer la main aux hommes...

Tu connais beaucoup de piscines où ça se fait ? Parce que d'une c'est illégal et que deux je n'en ai jamais vu une seule.

&gt;D'ailleurs la montée en force du FN en france s'explique en grande partie par le comportment de la communauté polonaise.

Ah bon ? Je croyais que c'était à cause de discours alarmistes, de tentatives de récupération d'électorat, de populisme qui marche bien auprès de certaines classes sociales et de grands discours sur l' « identité nationale » pour taper sur des moutons noirs (enfin... des moutons maghrébins) et divertir des problèmes importants.",null,0,null,1435910112,null,0,false,0,csqtiny,null,t3_3bs11e,null,t1_csqtiny,null,t1_csq4j2z,null,null,null,1437548195,null,0,false,france,t5_2qhjz,0,null

&gt;Priver les gens de partage pour traiter un symptôme sociétal plutôt que le mal en lui-même, je trouve ça dangereux et stupide

Où est-ce que le FN prévoirait de ""priver les gens de partage"" ?

&gt;C'est très facile de séparer la vision du parti pour gratter des voix d'électeurs de droite déculpabilisés. Déculpabilisés parce que la scission interne au FN a créé un clan (vide, il faut le reconnaître) de vieux fachos piloté par Jean-Marie Le Pen qui incarne les valeurs liberticides old school, et un clan de jeunes fachos pilotés par la fille qui incarne les valeurs liberticides subtiles et glamour.

En faite, si tu reprend le programme du FN aujourd'hui, tu verras que la plupart des propositions ont déjà été proposées par d'autres partis politiques de tous bords (oui oui, même des partis de gauche, même sur l'immigration). Le programme du FN est même beaucoup plus léger et tolérant que le programme du RPR dans les années 90 :

http://www.atlantico.fr/decryptage/programme-udf-rpr-1990-immigration-regret-pour-alain-juppe-mais-pour-francais-jerome-fourquet-1791582.html

Et quand tu parles de valeurs liberticides, il ne faut pas oublier que le FN s'oppose à la loi renseignement, au traité transatlantique, aux interventions militaires à l'extérieure, et à la plupars des lois liberticides qui ont été votées depuis 10 ans.

Das Problem bei dem fph drama ist, das Sie sagte ""We are banning behavioure and not ideas.""

Also ist wohl ein großer Kritikpunkt an ihr Inkonsequenz und eine Agenda die durchgedrückt werden soll.

&gt; It also impacted several other subreddits like /r/science[3] /r/music[4] and /r/books[5] which all had multiple large AMAs upcoming. In many cases, the mods have no ability to contact the people doing the AMAs (it was coordinated via Victoria). So they can't know if the AMAs are still happening and have no means of getting hold of the people participating to deal with any issues.
So a lot of subreddits are closing down in protest of the fact that the reddit admin team has no idea what they're doing, take their mods and users for granted, and haven't done the basic due diligence required to make sure their own site can continue to function as the users expect.

Secondo me non c'è la necessità di entrare nei dettagli, perché ci sono almeno due ordini di grandezza fra Italia e Giappone. Si tratta quindi di due mercati che non si possono confrontare: da noi c'è una nicchia editoriale con numeri talmente bassi che rende qualsiasi iniziativa imprenditoriale una scommessa. In Giappone è una vera e propria industria. Con queste premesse, è normale che succeda quanto succede, ovvero che molte case editrici italiane preferiscano rischiare meno proponendo titoli già rodati su un mercato enorme (e spesso già tradotti in altri paesi), anziché rischiare puntando sui talenti di casa. Poi chiaro, se si volesse fare un'analisi più approfondita bisognerebbe confrontare dati equiparabili, capire le cause, etc. ma - ripeto - visto lo scarto enorme fra i due universi editoriali, non so quanto ne vale la pena.

Si je peux me permettre, je vais te dire comment marchent les managers de ma boite, globalement tu peux appliquer ces trucs toi-même, ça suit les enseignements un peu bullshit de Mark Horstman, mais globalement ça marche.        
Tu as quelques rituels à tenir (mets des reminders) dans un management moderne. Les gens vont critiquer, mais pour l'avoir vécu en tant que managé, j'ai trouvé ça super. C'est bien résumé dans ce [tweet](https://twitter.com/chuslin/status/616541850950856704).
     
**Fais des entretiens one on one**, une demi-heure par semaine avec chacun de tes managés.     
Dans ces entretiens discute informellement du travail, est-ce que ça leur plait, est-ce qu'ils sont fatigués, quelle genre de tâche ils aimeraient faire. Demande leur ce qu'ils ont fait ce week-end, où ils partent pour leurs vacances, etc. L'exemple typique c'est: ""est-ce que tu connais les prénoms des enfants de tes managés?"", la réponse devrait tout le temps être oui. Très peu de chance d'avoir des démissions surprises lorsque tu entretiens un rapport d'honnêteté avec tes managés.        

**Fais des feedbacks**, tout le temps, toujours. Qu'ils soient positifs et négatifs, essaye de toujours dire honnêtement ce que tu penses du travail de tes employés. Évidemment faut faire ça de manière bienveillante.

**Demande du feedback**, tant qu'à faire demande leur aussi ce que tu pourrais faire de mieux.     

**Délègue**. C'est compliqué de pousser du travail vers ses managés, y a peu de managers qui font ça, mais ça responsabilise les mecs, et ils donnent du leur généralement pour faire ses taches là qui représentent ce que serait leur job s'ils recevaient une promotion. S'ils y arrivent, ils peuvent négocier une augmentation plus facilement, et ils peuvent rajouter une ligne à leur CV qui leur permettrait à leur prochain boulot d'obtenir le travail que tu es en train de faire.       

EDIT: d'ailleurs à sa prez, il a dit que 50% du succès venait des entretiens One on One (ou O3), 40% du feedback, et 20% du reste. Et que c'était plus important d'établir une relation de confiance avec ses managés que tout le reste.",null,0,null,1435912274,null,0,1435912473,0,csqu3vi,null,t3_3byo1o,null,t1_csqu3vi,null,t1_csqtj78,null,null,null,1437548697,null,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3,null

Non so quindi se siano ancora in perdita come annunciato anni e anni fa quando si sostenevano solo con gli ads e non erano stati acquistati da Conde Nast.

Sulla questione specifica di ieri: appunto perché è una società la cui userbase è profondamente intrecciata col sito non può permettersi problemi di comunicazione simili. Non è che reddit attualmente abbia chissà che buon rapporto con la sua utenza e alcune delle ultime scelte sono state decisamente poco lungimiranti.

Depends a bit on what you consider ""big"", but I would say you have have enough to fill your semester easily. Of the top of my head:
- the [Zoo](http://www.zoo-leipzig.de/en/homepage/), you could spend and entire day there, and apparently it has nice collection of primates;
- Many good Museums, including one of my favourites (I forgot the name but it is in Thomasgaße) whose collection documents in a parallel timeline daily lives, and how historical were perceived in both west and east Germany (free admission). 
- More old churches that you throw a stick at.
- Busking of good quality, helped by the music tradition of the city - and of course classical music concerts all the time.
- Many bars in the city center and in the alternative quarter (forgot the name, but mention Flower Power and the locals will direct you there)
- Speaking of alternative, [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/04/travel/04Next.html) and [this](http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/leipzig-is-the-new-berlin-a-863088.html).  A bit of hyperbole, but you get the idea.  

&gt;I would love to work on becoming fluent so that could be a plus for me.  Would you suggest dorming or trying to find an apartment?

If your goal is to learn a bit of German, stay in a flat. you will interact with other students from abroad during classes anyway, and staying in a flat will allow to practice you German and meet other people.Basically an opportunity away from English as main language to force the use of German. Also, you are luck the buildings/quarters can be quite nice and charming. I did not study there, only stayed for 2.5 weeks for a course, so I don't know about prices. But I do have friends co-workers that lived or studied there, and they rave about the city. I think it is almost as nice as Dresden :) (Saxonians will understand).

There are two termes I mixed up:
There are infringments, like speeding. These kind of rulebrakes are fined with the authority of the police or any other kind of executive that is enabled to do so. The money you have to pay here is called fines.

Than there are misdamenors. The executives can only report you to the prosecutor who will deal with that. If you don't settle it with him, a court has to decide over monetary damages (for drunk driving bike, it will not be a jail-sentence, but legally, it would be possible)

And than there are real crimes. A crime is something were you have to go at least for a year into jail.

So, I used the wrong word, it is a misdemeanor. And about how to get home:
The rule is with bikes if you have less than 1,6 pro mille in your blood, you can be prosecuted only if you do obviouse mistakes while biking that could come because you are drunk. If you have more than 1,6, than you can't proove that you are able to bike safly, because it is legally assumed that you can't.
If you are to drunk to even bike (the ""you can't proove that you still can drive""-assumption for cars is at 1,1 Pro Mille), than you have to call a taxi, walk or use public transportation.",null,0,null,1435913162,null,0,false,0,csquc0j,null,t3_3bsjri,null,t1_csquc0j,null,t1_csqiz4g,null,null,null,1437548886,null,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1,null

Is it something you can relate? this can happen also in America? Or you think is different? (btw: don't forget that everything change a lot from region to region)

Penso che la differenza di base sia così alta che anche con l'esercizio fisico non possa compensare, probabilmente son richieste iniezioni di testosterone. 

Il fatto è che probabilmente i livelli di testosterone di un uomo all'interno di una donna creerebbero effetti indesiderati in quanto anomali e fuori dai parametri standard, sempre al link sopra ho letto:

&gt;Excess androgens in a woman’s blood stream can cause obvious physical effects, including:

&gt;infertility

&gt;loss of scalp hair

&gt;acne

&gt;irregular or absent menses

&gt;growth of facial hair

&gt;Testosterone deficiency, on the other hand, can cause fertility problems, weak bones, and loss of libido.

mods sind nur diejenigen die subreddits moderieren, das kann jeder werden, einfach neues subreddit erstellen, und man ist mod des subreddits. Admins hingegen sind ganz oben in der Hierarchie, haben mit den ganzen subreddits auch nichts zu tun, die greifen nur ein wenn subreddits (bzw. deren mods) sich nicht an die wenigen existierenden Regeln halten (in dem Fall fatpeoplehate ging es um doxxing [Private Daten wie Namen, Adresse, Familie bekannt machen] bestimmter Personen, und die Aufforderung diese zu terrorisieren), da haben die admins dann einen Riegel davor geschoben.

&gt;At that time the city of Turin had a population of 117,000 inhabitants. It reflected the effects of industrialization and urbanization: numerous poor families lived in the slums of the city, having come from the countryside in search of a better life. In visiting the prisons Don Bosco was disturbed to see so many boys from 12 to 18 years of age. He was determined to find a means to prevent them ending up here. Because of population growth and migration to the city, Bosco found the traditional methods of parish ministry inefficient. He decided it was necessary to try another form of apostolate, and he began to meet the boys where they worked and gathered in shops, market places. They were pavers, stone-cutters, masons, plasterers who came from far away places, he recalled in his brief *Memoirs.* Memorys

No need for that once you are in Germany. Take one of the intensive course at a [Volkshochschule](http://vhs-goettingen.de/index.php?id=116). Way cheaper and the courses are pretty good.

**If you can afford it**, consider moving to Germany, and spend 2-3 months learning and really immersing yourself in the language. It might be easier than learning in Portugal and not using it on a daily basis. But do not expect to easily find a job without knowing at least some German.

Ok. A questo rispondo con:

&gt; Allora non hai capito, visto che ti ho appena detto che Tex da solo arriva ad un terzo (35%) di One Piece. Senza contare ristampa, seconda ristampa, texone, speciali, a colori e chi sa cos'altro.
E anche il meno venduto, vale 1/39 di One Piece, non un centesimo e un decimo di quello al 12° posto (e Saguaro, quindi non erano cifre regolari). Poi c'è da considerare che li hanno il giornale settimanale a poco con tutte le storie.

Mentre la seconda parte:

&gt; Come ho detto, era semplicemente una bolla, salvo quelli più famosi e più grandi in Italia vendevano poco, appena non sono più riusciti a gestirla, è scoppiata. Infatti adesso stanno iniziando a puntare sui fumetti italiani, contando anche sul fatto che è più facile che l'autore italiano faccia il giro delle fiere portando visibilità e soldi che uno giapponese che andrà quasi sicuramente in perdita tolto il prezzo del viaggio e dell'alloggio.

&gt; Con queste premesse, è normale che succeda quanto succede, ovvero che molte case editrici italiane preferiscano rischiare meno proponendo titoli già rodati su un mercato enorme (e spesso già tradotti in altri paesi), anziché rischiare puntando sui talenti di casa. Poi chiaro, se si volesse fare un'analisi più approfondita bisognerebbe confrontare dati equiparabili, capire le cause, etc. ma - ripeto - visto lo scarto enorme fra i due universi editoriali, non so quanto ne vale la pena. Da un punto di vista imprenditoriale, la situazione è chiara.

Man beachte den/die/das edit. Ich habe keine Ahnung, wie repräsentativ das ist, oder wie mods damit umgegangen sind. Aber es sagt schon auch irgendwie aus, was sich da für Gestalten rumtreiben bzw. rumgetrieben haben.

Als FPH gelöscht wurde, schwappte das ja über ganz reddit, und dieses scheinheilige Free-Speech Getue, hat bei mir nur noch mehr Ekel statt Mitleid erzeugt. Klar sind die irgendwie seelisch krank und nicht sehr helle, aber dann würde ich sie bestenfalls sachte raussetzen wie ein bissiges Insekt. Ohne Hass, aber auch ohne Zögern.

Ich würde das genau so auch Pastor Niemöller sagen, for better or worse... ich weiß ja selber nicht, ob ich meine Einstellung gut finde, ob man da so leicht die Schultern zucken sollte. Ich kann aber nicht anders, in diesem Fall.

Aber hey, sagen wir mal, das wäre echt der Anfang einer unguten Entwicklung -- dann glaube ich dennoch nicht, dass die FPH-Heinis bei einem solchen ""Kampf"" eine Hilfe gewesen wären. Wer solche Freunde hat, braucht keine Feinde. Reddit kann nur in begrenztem Ausmaß Therapie und Aufklärung leisten, und diese Bengels waren einfach zu viele und zu kaputt. Wünsche denen trotzdem, dass sie mal glücklich werden und nicht mehr auf Schwächeren rumhacken müssen, aber dieses ""Wohlwollen"" kann für mich nicht auf Kosten derer gehen, auf denen sie rumhacken. Manche Dinge schließen sich gegenseitig aus, und dann muß man halt auch mal entscheiden.

Reddit kann so korrupt oder scheinheilig sein wie es will, jedenfalls in diesem Fall finde ich die Entscheidung zufällig gut.

Nel 1937 il PIL Statunitense aveva già recuperato i livelli precedenti al 1929, soltanto la disoccupazione era ancora un pochino più alta. Questo ""lag"" del New Deal si coniugò ad una piccola recessione verso la fine degli anni 30 che avvenne proprio perché Roosevelt abbandonò le pratiche Keynesyane ed avviò una politica di austerity sotto pressione dei Repubblicani, con scarsi successi. Senza una tale svolta, gli US avrebbero messo fine agli ultimi rantoli della Depressione anche prima del 1941. La guerra risolse la disoccupazione, anche attraverso quelle che comunque sono manovre economiche (il governo USA spese anche molto negli export bellici e nella creazione di infrastrutture ad altri paesi alleati)

null,false,boa13,ZZZZZZhacker,Hacker,null,"Niveau BD, j'ai enfin lu [Azrayen'](http://www.dupuis.com/catalogue/FR/al/3680/azrayen_edition_integrale.html) scénario de Giroud, dessins de Lax, deux tomes sur la guerre d'Algérie, très bien. Petite imperfection quand même, et petite déception, j'ai trouvé que le scénario était par moments un peu trop didactique, un peu trop de personnages de tous bords qui tentent d'illustrer toutes les facettes de la guerre. C'est pas trop flagrant non plus, mais ça m'a un peu gêné. Globalement, ça reste une bonne lecture.

J'ai également lu la série de SF [Terres Lointaines](http://www.dargaud.com/bd/Terres-lointaines), scénario de Leo et dessins/couleurs d'Icar. J'ai été assez déçu malheureusement. Pas de problème niveau dessin (à part un ou deux cases avec des erreurs de perspective bien visibles), mais le scénario est une caricature, une redite des autres scénarios de Leo. J'imagine que si on découvre cet auteur avec cette série, on ne sera pas déçu, mais quand on a lu une bonne partie du reste de son œuvre, c'est décevant. Encore le même mix de haute technologie spatiale et de colonies tiers-monde, encore un monde à découvrir, encore une faune et une flore extraordinaires et dangereuses, encore des jeunes adultes et adolescents qui grandissent significativement à travers le déroulé de l'histoire, encore des scientifiques à l'écoute de la nature et pas le gouvernement qui est corrompu, encore des extra-terrestres supérieurs aux humains, etc. Il y a bien quelques variations (quête du père, extraterrestre tellement fort qu'il sauve en permanence la mise). Ce n'est pas désagréable et c'est bien raconté, mais c'est du fortement déjà vu. Le final en particulier (tome 5) est expédié de manière presque énervante, or il aurait pu tout sauver en exploitant différemment ce qui avait été mis en place.

Bon et sinon je suis allé voir ~~Supertramp~~ [Roger Hodgson](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hodgson) en concert, et c'était très bon. Lui-même a un peu vieilli (difficile de tenir certains aigus maintenant), mais sans que ça gêne le show heureusement. Il est entouré de bons musiciens, mais qui manquent un peu de charisme (très effacés derrière lui, à l'exception du gars qui joue tous les instruments à vent). Musicalement pas de souci, ça envoyait bien comme il faut. Et de plus, il avait une excellente communication avec le public, une certaine candeur et franchise, beaucoup de français dans ses phrases (il a vécu un an à Nantes), qui font que le public était complètement survolté, avec d'énormes périodes d'applaudissements et de bravos en plein concert, un enthousiasme et une chaleur assez rares pour un concert placé assis. Et outre ses chansons perso qu'il avait enregistrées à Nantes (que j'ai découvert à cette occasion, et qui étaient assez agréables), il a bien entendu aligné un énorme nombre de tubes de l'époque Supertramp.

&gt;Également, l'âge d'Aisha est sujet à controverse, les muftis et sheikhs ne s'accordent pas sur son âge lors de son mariage avec Muhammad, les estimations allant de 5 à 17 ans; et Muhammad se mariait principalement à des veuves ou des orphelines pour être sûr qu'elles ne finiraient pas en esclavage (inb4 ""pédophile"").

L'âge de Aïsha n'a pas fait débat pendant 1300 ans. C'est seulement depuis 80 ans que certains ont commencé à parler d'âges plus avancés.

&gt;&gt;*insert Surat un-Nisa' 4:35*

&gt;C'est l'assignement de rôles différents pour les hommes et pour les femmes dont il est question, pas de hiérarchiser bêtement les sexes. Les deux méritent le même respect, etc... Cependant le Coran a été dicté au 7e siècle, quand seuls les hommes travaillaient, jouissaient d'une certaine indépendance. Les hommes étaient donc capables de leadership et d'autonomie, alors que les femmes n'avaient pas cette place dans la société de l'époque.

&gt;Aujourd'hui tu trouvera beaucoup de fatwas qui autorisent les femmes à travailler, étudier, avoir de l'argent (le concept de partage des possessions entre mariés n'existe pas dans l'Islam; seule existe une somme que l'époux doit donner à l'épouse en cas de divorce), et même à avoir une place équivalente à celle de l'homme dans le leadership de la famille.

Et alors ? Ça ne remet pas en question un très grand nombre de passages du Coran qui sont aujourd'hui misogynes. C'est de ça qu'on parle : de la place des femmes dans le Coran et des passages misogynes. Ma phrase était : ""il faut être malhonnête pour affirmer que le Coran ne contient pas de passages misogynes"".

Tu fais un simple tour sur l'article wikipedia ""women in Islam"" et tu as plein de passages qui sont aujourd'hui misogynes. 

Heureusement que depuis il y a eu des fatwas pour corriger le tir. 

http://islam.faq.free.fr/livres/coran/2.htm

222\. - Et ils t'interrogent sur la menstruation des femmes. - Dis: ‹C'est un mal. Eloignez-vous donc des femmes pendant les menstrues, et ne les approchez que quand elles sont pures. Quand elles se sont purifiées, alors cohabitez avec elles suivant les prescriptions d'Allah car Allah aime ceux qui se repentent, et Il aime ceux qui se purifient›.

223\. Vos épouses sont pour vous un champ de labour; allez à votre champ comme [et quand] vous le voulez et oeuvrez pour vous-mêmes à l'avance. Craignez Allah et sachez que vous le rencontrerez. Et fais gracieuses annonces aux croyants!

228\. Et les femmes divorcées doivent observer un délai d'attente de trois menstrues; et il ne leur est pas permis de taire ce qu'Allah a créé dans leurs ventres, si elles croient en Allah et au Jour dernier. Et leurs époux seront plus en droit de les reprendre pendant cette période, s'ils veulent la réconciliation. Quant à elles, elles ont des droits équivalents à leurs obligations, conformément à la bienséance. Mais les hommes ont cependant une prédominance sur elles. Et Allah est Puissant et Sage.

&gt;Les *ahadith* ont pour seul contexte le Coran, leurs rapporteurs et les sociétés Arabes au 7e siècle.

Oui, elles ont donc comme contexte un monde extrêmement violent et misogyne. Du coup on retrouve cette violence et misogynie dedans,  et dans le Coran aussi. Faut pas nier l'évidence, ça ne veut pas dire que les musulmans sont misogynes ou violents. 

&gt;&gt;Je n'ai jamais dit que les filles allaient dans l'armée, par contre que leur fonction était bien de pondre un maximum de petits soldats, vu que la survie de l'espèce n'était absolument pas menacée.

&gt;Alors pourquoi encourager le fait d'avoir des filles au lieu de ""petits soldats""? :&gt;

Pas ""au lieu de"". Tu vois ça où ? 

&gt;Au passage, débattre quand à l'Islam ne me dérange en rien, mais montre un peu moins d'agressivité dans tes posts stp.

À partir du moment où ta première réaction était de dire  ""signé un mec qui n'a pas lu le Coran""  j'estime que c'est mérité.

Das habe die Kubanische Revolution und »30 Jahre Guerillakrieg in Lateinamerika« zur Folge gehabt.

Also gab's Cola. In der Schule waren es meistens ein oder zwei 0,5l Pepsi-Flaschen am Tag, zuhause dann Coca Cola, eine Zeit lang auch Sinalco. Dazu noch Milch. Das lief dann so, bis ich die Schule verlassen habe.  
Während des Studiums hat sich mein Cola-Konsum dadurch stark reduziert, dass ich keinen Supermarkt in der Nähe hatte, der 1L-Mehrwegflaschen führte und ich (ohne Auto) die Kisten nicht durch die halbe Stadt schleppen wollte. Aus Einwegflaschen schmeckte mir Cola nicht so gut. Deswegen gab es dann auch bisschen Abwechslung, die aber nicht weniger zuckerhaltig war.

Und dann habe ich mich im März einfach mal umentschieden. ""Classic"" Wasser mag ich immer noch nicht, ""Still"" vertrage ich auch nicht, aber ""Medium"" sagt mir zu. Also gibt's jetzt fast ausschließlich Discounter-Mediumwasser. Und Milch. Und vielleicht auch mal 'ne Cola, wenn man auswärts isst und noch fahren muss.

c'est surtout que tu ne sais pas ce que veux dire *rouler sur la dette*



&gt; le 'Ya qu'à' 'faut qu'on' est assez fort.

fort en quoi ? c'est ce qu'on appelle restructurer la dette (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_relief), et là on explique comment le procédé se passe à travers la BCE. Restructuration qui est demandée par tous mais l'Allemagne n'en veut pas en entendre parler.

&gt;Si on enlève une partie de la dette grecque pourquoi pas celle de la France ou celles d'autres pays qui ont fait plus d'efforts que la Grèce, ou qui ont une économie plus mauvaise ?

mathématiquement parlant la Grece ne peut rembourser à cette allure, elle est condamnée dans une spirale récessionniste, sans restructuration de la dette, ca ne fera qu'empirer (pas comparable à la situation francaise par ex)

&gt;Et faire marcher la machine à billet n'est pas une solution viable à part si on souhaite dévaluer l'euro et rendre tous les produits d'importation bien plus cher. (suis pas économiste mais ça paraît logique)

Start - self explanatory

Bügelleicht - ""easy to iron"", supposedly it reduces wrinkling

Spülen plus - extended rinse cycle, uses more water, washes out more of the detergent

Intensiv Waschen - intensive cleaning cycle, more cycles, for very dirty clothes

Left rotary switch - it's for choosing the spinning speed (in rounds per minute), the last position, ""Spülstop"", stops the rinse cycle early if you want your clothes completely wet, sitting in water until you get it out of the machine.

Right rotary switch - the programs, numbers mean temperature in celsius: 

""Aus"" - machine turned off

""Pflegeleicht"" is for sensible material, the machine spins less/slower, the soaking process is shorter so the clothes don't suffer from the detergent. 

""Koch/Buntwäsche"" - normal program, 60 Flecken means 60° celsius 'stains', prolongued soaking cycles to get stains out. 60 + Vorwäsche include the pre-washing cycle, uses more water and more detergent from the third compartment in the detergent drawer (the one on the right, marked with a 'I' - 'II' on the left is where you put the detergent for the normal cycle - * in the middle is for the softener/conditioner).

""Spülen"" - rinse cycle (followed by spinning, I think)

""Schleudern"" - just the spinning cycle

""Abpumpen"" - for pumping out the water, e.g. if you used ""Spülstop"" and there's still water in the machine.",null,0,null,1435921096,null,0,false,0,csqw7eu,null,t3_3bi9ll,null,t1_csqw7eu,null,t3_3bi9ll,null,null,null,1437550397,null,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1,null

Diese „Ausschlussklausel-Sprache“ ist ein Merkmal der neuen Generation der Verschwörungsideologen. Ihre Anhänger haben das größtenteils noch nicht so drauf. Dafür sind die Chefprediger umso geübter. Ken Jebsens Karriere in der Gosse fing mit einem Fehltritt in dieser Sprache an. Ein Fehler den er seit dem tunlichst versucht zu vermeiden während er gleichzeitig die Grenzen austestet. Ein gutes Beispiel für die Anfänge ist sein Interview mit Serdar Somuncu der auf die kläglichen Versuche die Ideologie zu verschleiern hindeutet. 

Die Grenzen dieser Art zu predigen kann man sehr gut bei den Live Auftritten von Jebsen oder Ganser beobachten. Besonders Jebsen fällt es schwer tatsächlich einfach seinen Conspiracy Klartext   so auszupacken, dass keine Widersprüche entstehen. Aber er hält durch. Er weiß, daß er gerade in der VIP Loge der deutschen Verschwörungsszene sitzt. Jedes Abgleiten vom Skript würde ihn sofort eine Stufe näher an den Kopp Verlag bombardieren was auch seine Einnahmen schmälern dürfte. Im Falle von Ganser ist das noch kritischer, da der Mann eine Art wissenschaftlichen Joker darstellt. Egal bei welchem Thema eine fundierte Meinung oder Fakten gefragt werden, sind solche „Wissenschaftler“ gefragt und Ganser ist sehr gefragt derzeit. 

Natürlich geht diese Selbstzensur auch nicht am Publikum vorbei. Diese überall propagierte Ausschlussklausel die zu Eigenrecherche animiert, ist in Wirklichkeit nur eine Werbung für die eigenen Seiten und „Quellen“. Ein Mitläufer der sich tatsächlich informiert und zu Widersprüchen bzgl. der Predigt kommt, wird von seiner Gruppe verlassen. Oft führt das auch noch dazu, dass die Person auch noch als Agent der Gegenseite (U-Boot, Shill, u.ä.) deklariert wird. Der praktische Nebeneffekt eines solchen Ausschlusses ist, dass die eigene Gruppe plötzlich viel wichtiger wirkt. Dabei spielt es keine Rolle ob es sich um ein Forum mit 2000 Leuten oder eine FB-Gruppe mit 10 handelt. 

Alles schon erlebt.

Was Ganser zu einem riesigen Fake macht im Gegensatz zum „einfachen Fake“ wie Jebsen, ist sein Anspruch der ganzen Predigt eine unumstößliche Glaubwürdigkeit durch seine Person zu verschaffen. Das ist natürlich ein ganz besonderer Tanz auf der Klinge. Während Jebsen gerne ab und zu stolpern kann, da er ja nur ein „Journalist“ ist, ist Ganser das Rückrad der gesamten Ideologie. Wenn er fällt, müssen diese Leute wieder bei 0 anfangen und es ist nicht einfach für diese Gruppe Wissenschaftler zu rekrutieren. Wissenschaftler die sich auch noch so gerne auf die Bühne stellen schon gar nicht. Ganser macht es tatsächlich schwerer für Mitläufer die zweifeln abzuspringen. Du würdest doch keinen Wissenschaftler widersprechen! Seine Aussagen werden ja wohl auf wissenschaftlicher Arbeit basieren! Auf Fakten und Experimenten!

Deswegen ist Ganser gefährlicher als Jebsen und deswegen ist er ein riesiger Fake.

&gt; Allerdings will ich hier nur noch kurz anmerken, dass man im Allgemeinen mit Freundlichkeit viel eher Mut zur Wahrheit verbreitet. Deine Post History zeigt viel Aggresivität, ob zu Gleich- oder Andersgesinnten. Möglicherweise wäre es zum Teil eher hilfreich für die Sache, so etwas ruhiger anzugehen. 

Dieses Konto entstand aus den Erfahrungen die wir mit der Welle der AfD Mitläufer hatten als die Partei noch überall in den Medien war. Die Erfahrungen zeigten, daß nach einiger Zeit die Mitläufer gegen Argumente immun wurden. Während einige daraufhin auf Humor umschwenkten, erstellte ich dieses Konto um einen anderen Ansatz zu versuchen. Während Humor, und Argumente diverse Seiten der Verblendung betroffener Personen aufzeigen, zeigen sie jedoch oft nicht alles. Ich sorge dafür, dass diese Lücke geschlossen wird. Ich springe niemanden an der seriös und ernsthaft diskutiert oder zerstöre eine Diskussion. Wenn ich eingreife ist meist Hopfen und Malz bereits verloren.

&gt; By ""expensive"" I meant the more serious stuff you needed if you wanted to hook up more than 10 PCs to have a bigger LAN party. Cheapernet with T-connectors and terminators at both ends didn't cut it any longer if you went bigger.

But it wasn't prohibitively expensive. We had communal boxes of spare cables, cards, terminators, etc. and basically all anyone had to buy for his first LAN was the NIC.


&gt; Multi-Port-Bridges (those young whippersnappers call them ""Switches"" today) where, as you said, not cheap, but necessary to have a usable network.

And as I said, we managed 20ish player LANs with networks working on duct tape and fairy dust (or goat sacrifice). The first switches being purchased in our LAN circles helped tremendously, though.

&gt; When I organized my first semi-professional LAN-Party in '97 we loaned network equipment (some 10/100 Hubs, some 100MBit Switches for the Backbone including some Fiber-Modules, some servers for Novell3) from the company of a friends dad. The price tag to buy that stuff would have been at about 50.000DM, but we were lucky and got it for free.

We never did any (semi-)professional LANs, but we had a few guys who knew guys at local IT outfitters who could borrow hardware for the bigger private LANs (50+ people at community centres or the dance halls of a few run-down Wirtshäuser who were happy about the revenue and didn't charge for the room usage like [this one](http://i.imgur.com/s1kE2xC.jpg)).


&gt; [space issues]

I think you misunderstood me there. 

I assumed that the demand for gaming cafés was increased in cities due to lack of free space for private LAN parties. We basically had one whenever we bloody well wanted (**at least** one per month and if I had to guess I'd say we averaged at two per month at least) as there was always someone up for it with enough space to host 10+ people so there was little to no demand for gaming cafés from us in the next few bigger towns. I don't think I've ever saw one around here, actually. The closest ones to me must have been in Munich.


I don't doubt that the real estate prices accelerated their demise once the demand started to dry up, though.

&gt; While organizing my last LAN party in 2005, when it was quite difficult to get people to sign up to be a guest, most people said ""Why would I haul all my equipment to a LAN party? I can play the same games from home just as fine.""
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Well, that was the moment when I knew than smaller LAN parties (less than 500 guests) were a thing of the past. Only the really big events with tournaments to win real money survived.

Well, yeah. Mid-sized LAN is completely dead. I still do very small ones with some mates from Austria (basically Dota2 weekends where we 5 stack in the same room) and another group of online friends is tentatively planning to hold a 10-20 man one so we can hang out and get drunk IRL, but the demand for LAN as an online replacement is long gone.",null,0,null,1435922271,null,0,false,0,csqwhox,null,t3_3bo548,null,t1_csqwhox,null,t1_csp0ocg,null,null,null,1437550608,null,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1,null

Dazu muss die Handlung eine Person nicht unerheblich in ihrem Empfinden beeinträchtigen, z. B. indem sie Gefühle von Ekel, Schock oder Schrecken verursacht oder das Schamgefühl verletzt.[5] Die Belästigung ist nicht gegeben, wenn die Reaktion des oder der Betroffenen Interesse, Verwunderung oder Mitleid ist.[5]

Auch wenn's vom Thema etwas abweicht, ist das nicht Diskriminierung? Hübsche Frauen dürfen also jederzeit nackt durch die Fußgängerzone laufen, weil das wohl die wenigsten nicht interessant fänden, wenn ich als dicker Mann aber wegen der hohen Temperaturen auf Kleidung verzichten möchte ist das strafbar?

:)

*edit* huiuiui, so viele Antworten mit Paragraphen, etc. Wollte eigentlich nur n kleinen Scherz machen (und hatte gehofft der Smilie reicht als Kennzeichnung) und hatte keine ernsthafte Diskussion erwartet.

Tsipras avait été assez clair mais pas aussi explicite.  D'autres depuis rendent la chose moins claire.

&gt; Et franchement, je trouve assez hallucinante la série d'articles qui semblent avoir décidé que Syriza devait disparaitre en cas de ""oui"".

Franchement, je trouverais bizarre de rester au pouvoir après avoir appelé à voter ""non"".  (Mais bon, les politiques qui ne tirent pas la conséquence de leur désaveux en France ça semble la norme.)

&gt; Et Schulz va carrément plus loin. Il ne demande pas juste une démission et de nouvelles élections. Il veut que si le oui l'emporte, immédiatement le gouvernement soit remplacé par des technocrates non élus. C'est juste hallucinant: il désire nommer les dirigeants grecs.

Où as-tu vu qu'il désire les nommer lui-même?  Il désire que le parlement grec nomme des interlocuteurs qui peuvent commencer à discuter et accepter les mesures transitoires car celles-ci seront urgentes.  Et Syriza ne sera pas vraiment en position de donner des interlocuteurs acceptables (en cas de non non plus d'ailleurs, commencer à insulter les gens avec qui tu dois négocier(*), c'est pas bon, quand tu es dans la position du demandeur, c'est que tu veux échouer)

&gt; J'ai l'impression que tout le monde ne réalise pas la portée de ce qu'il exige: c'est une négation de la démocratie en Europe.

Sincèrement, ceux qui lancent un référendum en 8 jours, de manière potentiellement inconstitutionnelle (quelqu'un sait où cet aspect en est? j'ai cru comprendre, mais n'ai pas souvenir d'avoir vu confirmation, qu'une court devait se prononcer là-dessus), en posant une question qui est difficilement compréhensible, faisant référence à des documents en anglais dont la version grecque comprend des contre-sens sur des points importants, ... me semblent beaucoup plus proche de la négation de la démocratie que ceux qui suggèrent que dans l'éventualité d'un résultat défavorable aux premiers on envoie négocier des gens qui n'ont pas insulté ceux avec qui ils vont devoir discuter.

Et oublier que les accords doivent doivent être accepter par une série de parlements nationaux, en particulier l'Allemand, me semble aussi ne pas être très démocrate.

En passant, j'avais écrit hier que je n'arrivais pas à comprendre Tsipras, je me demande maintenant si ce qu'il veut n'est pas la sortie de la Grèce de l'euro mais que sa méthode est aussi tordue parce qu'il sait qu'il n'aurait pas le support de la population grecque s'il le disait franchement.  En passant toujours, j'ai l'impression que certains en face sont des alliés objectifs.

Il y a trop de magouilles personnelles et de corruption et les classes les plus riches font indéniablement de l'évasion (comme partout, mais ailleurs on se donne plus les moyens de le poursuivre).

Wir hätten die gesamte griechische Ökonomie bereits kaufen können. Aber wir schleichen uns was zurecht weil wir hoffen das Zirpras Unterstützung wegbricht.
In der Zeit sinkt aber das Vertrauen jeglicher aussenstehender Investoren, da die Europäer anscheinend schonmal gerne ganze Länder in der Luft hängen lassen bis diese irgendwelche Kriterien erfüllen von denen manch andere Europäer weit entfernt sind.


Momentan steht die griechische Ökonomie still. Zirpras und Anhänger haben hierfür Verantwortung zu tragen. Schäuble aber auch. Dank Ihm wird kein möglicher Investor Griechenland oder wohlmöglich die EU insgesamt, als attraktives Kapital betrachten können.
Niemand wird ne Fabrik in Griechenland bauen wenn damit zu rechnen ist das der nächste Hirnfurz aus deutschen oder auch griechischen ""Hirnen"" wohlmöglich zu einer Einfrierung des Kapitals führt.

Man hätte Griechenlands Wirtschaft recht einfach beleben können. Geld transfers ausreichend um Griechenlands Wirtschaft wieder lebensfähig zu machen und wohl möglich in die Lage zu versetzen Schulden zu tilgen, wohl möglich die an deutschland, wäre insgesamt günstiger gewesen als dieser trotzige Wettkampf.

Griechenlands Regierung wäre gefeiert worden, wohlmöglich wäre Zirpras garnicht erst gewählt worden. Wollte man Griechenland eine Lektion erteilen? Ein Lektion im Haushalten die noch unzählige Milliarden an europäischen Steuergelern verschlingt da Griechenland durch diesen albernen Kurs auf Jahrzehnte wirtschaftlich gehemmt sein wird?

Und leider ist es sogar so, dass die Opposition besonders oft bei Abstimmungen fehlt, führend ist hier die Linke.

L'UE o perlomeno l'eurozona andrebbe probabilmente in pezzi( un conto è se lascia la grecia che in quanto a gdp vale meno di molte regioni italiane da sole un'altro se lascia l'Italia)e l'Italia farebbe default (come cacchio facciamo a pagare il nostro immenso debito con una lira super svalutata che non accetterebbe nessuno come pagamento).

I prezzi dell'elettricità( e quindi delle bollette ), della benzina e del gas schizzerebbero in alto ( visto che acquistiamo elettricità petrolio e gas dall'estero con la lira svalutata sarebbe un casino pagare i fornitori esteri di queste materie prime ) con conseguente diminuzione del potere d'acquisto delle famiglie (quindi credo ci potrebbe essere un calo di consumi interni). 

Le Industrie avrebbero problemi a pagare le materie prime necessarie per continuare a funzionare ma forse beneficerebbero da un aumento delle esportazioni grazie alla lira supersvalutata ( bisogna vedere però se eventuali maggiori esportazioni valgono la candela di dover pagare le materie prime per produrre un occhio della testa ).

Altra crisi enorme in europa causata da mancanza di fiducia dei mercati nella capacità degli altri vari paesi europei a rischio di pagare i loro debiti con forse ripercussioni a livello globale. Un'altra crisi in stile 2008 insomma solo che stavolta non scatenata dal fallimento di banche americana ma da noi.

Chi potrà portare gli euro all'estero( i ricconi) lo farà in tempo e probabilmente tornerà indietro ( insieme ad investitori cinesi/russi/americani) per comprarsi l'italia e le sue aziende/industrie a due euro una volta avvenuto il passaggio alla lira.

Insomma IMHO succederebbe un bel merdone (mi scuso per il francesismo) ma ripeto non sono un economista e ci vuole il parere di qualcuno esperto di economia per rispondere in maniera anche lontanamente plausibile a questa domanda (fan fatica a capire cosa potrebbe succedere esattamente in un caso del genere pure i premi nobel quindi figurati io).

Hi, ich sehe du wurdest fleißig gefüttert von den Deutschen Medien und hast wenig bis gar nicht über den eigenen Tellerrand geschaut. 

Nun: stell dir vor seit 5 Jahren steckt dein Land in der tiefsten politischen, sozialen und wirtschaftlichen Krise der Neuzeit. Seit 5 Jahren wird dir gesagt du musst sparen und du musst dein Land reformieren! Du sparst hier, kürzt die Renten und andere Sozialleistungen da, reformierst dort. Machst alles was dir die schlauen Europäer (allen voran die Deutschen*) vorschreiben. Statt das es besser wird, wird alles nur noch schlimmer. Viele Reformen greifen nicht, die Kürzungen in den Sozialleistungen spülen weniger Geld in die Kassen der Leute, statt zu investieren wird überall nur gespart und gekürzt und so wird jedes dringend benötigte Wirtschaftswachstum abgewürgt. Nach 5 Jahren kommen die Gläubiger und schlauen Europäer wieder und wollen Geld sehen. Du hast aber kein Geld, im Gegenteil du benötigst dringend mehr davon um dringende Investitionen tätigen zu können um Wachstumsimpulse setzen zu können. Die schlauen Europäer sind aber dazu nur bereit wenn die seit 5 Jahren nicht funktionierenden Reformen und Kürzungen noch verschärft werden. Und alles an was du denken kannst ist WTF?!

*Hast Du gewusst, dass Deutschland Anfang der 2000er Jahre bewusst die Euro Schuldengrenze missachtet hat um so mehr Schulden für wichtige Investitionen zu machen? Wie man jetzt sieht war die damalige Entscheidung nicht ganz so verkehrt. Deutschland steht heute wesentlich besser da als vor 10 Jahren. Der Unterschied zu Griechenland ist, dass Griechenland nicht Deutschland ist und somit nicht einfach machen kann was es will. Witzig ist auch, dass Deutschland eine Sparpolitik diktiert, die offensichtlich nicht funktioniert obwohl es selbst vor einem Jahrzehnt mit ganz anderen Mitteln aus der Krise gekommen ist. Naja solange Merkel , Schäuble &amp; Co weiterhin so tolle Beliebheitswerte haben muss ja alles OK sein bei uns.

Magari nel lungo periodo. Nel breve l'industria si ferma perche' nessuno vuole comprare macchinari che magari costano decine di migliaia di euro e correre il rischio di trovarsi senza supporto perche' il fornitore (l'azienda italiana) fallisce.

Ti sei anche dimenticato le pensioni si vedrebbero fortemente ridotte (ammesso che si riesca a pagarle). Prendi €800 oggi? Domani magari prendi l'equivalente della meta' in Lire

Il tasso di interesse schizzerebbe all'insu' - oggi il tasso base e' al 0.5% che diventano 3-5% sul mercato.
Con la Lira probabilmente guarderesti al 12-15% (minimo) perche' noi i soldi non ce li abbiamo e dall'estero di sicuro non ce li prestano visto che nessuno vorra' le lire (o le dracme).

L'Italia sarebbe inoltre incapace di importare medicinali dall'estero e quindi ci sarebbero ripercussioni sulla sanita' (sai com'e', tutte le case farmaceutiche grosse sono Italiane...perche' la investire in ricerca in Italia e' di moda /s)

Vivo all'estero e la mia prospettiva e' diversa ma proprio non riesco a capire tutti sti grillini, sinistroidi e leghisti che tifano per la Dracma in Grecia.

Im Prinzip wurde zwar formal das gemacht, was Europa gefordert hat, aber inhaltlich auf eine Weise, dass es den Sinn kontakariert hat, so dass die Reformen nur die Belastungen erzeugten, nicht aber die langfristigen Vorteile einbrachten. Und gerade als jene Vorteile anfingen zu kommen (anfang des Jahres), hat sich die Lage dank den Neuwahlen drastisch verschlechtert.


Zu den Verschuldungen: Dir ist bewusst, dass das, wofür das Geld genutzt werden soll, zwischen Deutschland in den 2000ern und Griechenland fundamental unterschiedlich ist? Griechenland hat keine nennenswerte inländische Produktion, die durch höhren Konsum angekurbelt werden könnte, sondern das Geld wird schnurstracks im Ausland ausgegeben (Importrate von 70 %! der alltäglichen Lebensmittel). Die griechische Regierung zeigt keinerlei Motivation die Lage für Unternehmer in Griechenland derart zu gestalten, dass die Investitionen sinnvoll zu positiven Änderung in Griechenland führen würden, zumindest nicht für länger als ein paar Monaten.

Vais-je recevoir 0 réponses ou 10 millions ?  J'ai parcouru pas mal de threads mais j'ai toujours des interrogations sans réponses.]

- Quelles ont été la ou les réponses officielles ? 

J'ai vu un post d'un admin, /u/knothing ou un truc approchant. Disant en gros ""Je vous ai compris. Maintenant svp rebranchez les subs, vous prenez les usagers en otages, c'est pas cool"".

Ce qui a été jugé très insuffisant, d'autant plus qu'il avait d'abord posté des commentaires provocateurs sur un thread de subredditdrama (du style : ""C'est con de faire grève"" et ""J'aime le pop corn"").

Quelqu'un saurait si c'est tout, ou si une chronologie existe avec les différentes réponses de plusieurs admins ?

- Quelles sont concrètement les améliorations demandées par les modérateurs d'un peu partout sur reddit ?

Outre le manque de communication, outre l'éviction sans prévenir de la fameuse Victoria des AMAs, il semble que les reproches émis concernent des demandes répétées pour la mise en place de divers outils visant à améliorer le site et la vie des modérateurs bénévoles. Concrètement que demandent-ils ? Est-ce facile à mettre en place ? Les réponses sont-elles si notoirement décevantes depuis longtemps ? Les modérateurs d'/r/france partagent-ils ce sentiment (ou est-ce que le sub est assez petit pour que ça fonctionne à peu près bien) ?

- Qui est Jesse Jackson et pourquoi a-t-il mauvaise presse auprès de pas mal d'américains ? Depuis longtemps ? Quels liens a-t-il (éventuellement) avec barack Obama ? (sans rentrer dans l'histoire de L'AMA, ça j'ai compris, mais j'ai pas le back up nécessaire sur qui il est exactement pour bien mesurer).


Je suis allé lire plein de threads sur le shitstorm mais je ne me sens concerné qu'en tant que redditeur, je veux bien comprendre, mais je ne juge pas utile de lier /r/france à ceci, sauf si les modérateurs se sentent concernés et/ou si la situation évolue (mal).

Mal abgesehen davon, dass der Benutzer hier eine Menge des ""Wertes"" liefert, und dafür eine gewisse Gegenseitigkeit schlicht geboten ist. Ohne reddit macht man halt andere Websiten -- ohne Benutzer macht reddit mal rein gar nix. Soooo toll ist es auch nicht programmiert.

Wenn sowas wie /r/askreddit abschaltet, dann ist die die Frage, ob die hyperaktiv und überreaktiv sind, oder du apathisch bist bzw. gar nichts weiter weißt oder wissen willst.

Aber ich überreagiere lieber selbst, mit einen Zitat von Sebastian Haffner aus ""Geschichte eines Deutschen"":

&gt; Der einzige Rest, der bei alledem bleibt, ist die völlig Abwesenheit von dem, was man, an einem Volk wie an einem Menschen, ""Rasse"" nennt: also eines festen, durch Druck und Zug von außen nicht zu erschütternden Kerns, einer gewissen adligen Härte, einer allerinnersten, gerade erst in der Stunde der Prüfung mobilisierbaren Reserve an Stolz, Gesinnung, Selbstgewißheit, Würde. Das haben die Deutschen nicht. Sie sind als Nation unzuverlässig, weich, kernlos.

Das spiegelt sich hier ganz gut wieder, finde ich \^\^ Nichtmal auf hacker news wird so abgewunken wie hier teilweise, und die sind weiß Gott nicht geil auf Drama.

Il ferro, in mg per 100 g, presente nei vegetali può essere anche più alto di quello presente nella carne animale.

Origine animale:
&gt; Secondo i dati INRAN, la carne di cavallo ha un contenuto di ferro di 3,9 mg/100 g; nella carne di bovino adulto il valore del ferro oscilla tra 1,1 e 1,9 mg/100 g (a seconda dei tagli); nel pollo, invece, questo è mediamente di 0,6-0,7 mg/100 g e scende a 0,4 mg nel petto di pollo ([source](http://www.donnamoderna.com/bellezza/alimentazione-wellness/sai-tutto-sulla-carne-scopriamolo-insieme2))

Origine vegetale:

&gt; Cioccolato fondente amaro	17,4	mg

&gt; Muesli	8,20	mg

&gt; Lenticchie	7,54	mg

&gt; Pinoli secchi	5,53	mg

&gt; Fagioli cannellini	5,49	mg

&gt; Fagioli borlotti freschi	5,00	mg

&gt; Fiocchi d'avena	4,72	mg

&gt; Nocciole	4,70	mg ([source](http://www.my-personaltrainer.it/nutrizione/alimenti-ricchi-ferro.html))

Ciò che cambia tra uno e l'altro è la biodisponibilità, la capacità dell'organismo di assimilare il nutriente. Il ferro negli alimenti [può essere eme o non eme](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assorbimento_del_ferro_alimentare#Il_ferro_negli_alimenti), il primo è più assimilabile ed è presente solo nelle carni (o meglio, una parte di quello negli animali è eme). Inoltre, l'abbinamento con alcuni cibi (the, caffè) limita l'assimilazione di ferro mentre con altri (vitamina C) viene aumentata.

Non preoccuparti che non decidi niente tu. Hai votato per l'euro? Io no. Quand'è che si andava? Non mi è arrivato l' avviso dal comune.

Quello che succede per noi che andiamo a lavorare è che i prezzi schizzano alle stelle, gli stipendi vengono erosi dalla superinflazione e lo stato sociale in generale va a prostituirsi. Perchè?

Perchè quelli che decideranno, quando lo decideranno, decideranno anche di non implementare misure protettive del reddito da lavoro quali ad esempio agganciare salari all' inflazione o un sistema di universal basic income, cose che potrebbero fare anche domani, per inciso. Inoltre decideranno, come già hanno fatto, di aumentare la tassazione indiretta e proporzionale (come IVA, bolli, accise e similaria) e di lasciare invariata la tassazione progressiva (aliquota IRPEF unica, no patrimoniale, no aumento tassazione su plusvalenze/guadagni finanziari, no aumento tassazione capitali).

Perchè? Perchè tanto tu che devi andare a prenderli, ordinarli in fila contro un muro e mettergli un proiettile in testa non fai un cazzo, al massimo ti fai le seghe su internet. Per farti sfogare ti fanno anche votare, pensa te, ci sono per tutti i gusti, quelli reazionari, quelli razzisti, quelli perbenisti che le parolacce non si dicono che siamo educati, quelli che ti fanno sentire un po' migliore degli altri perchè tu che voti quelli sì che ne capisci, quelli che sono incazzati contro il sistema (a parole) così ti sfoghi un po' by proxy e quelle manine che ti prudono tanto le usi a farti le pippe invece che a menare quelli che ti rubano la vita.

Ma tanto non preoccuparti, che del pareggio di bilancio in costituzione non si ricorda più nessuno, e la montagna di debito pubblico che ti schiaccia e che diventa sempre più grande ogni giorno non la userà nessuno come il fucile da puntarti alla testa per farti rigare buonino la prossima volta che c'è da andare a votare - vorrai mica fare la fine dei greci, metti la crocetta sul partito della nazione. E poi non lamentarti per 5 anni, che è colpa tua, li hai scelti tu quelli che comandano.

Natürlich sind die Probleme die Deutschland damals hatte nicht unbedingt die gleichen wie Griechenland heute. Das sollte klar sein. Der springende Punkt in dieser Thematik ist, dass Deutschland durch Sparen, dem Land angepasst Reformen UND Investitionen die Krise gemeistert hat. Griechenland wird aber zum Sparen und Reformieren geprügelt und keinen Raum für Investitionen gelassen. Das dies nicht den gewünschten Effekt hat, hat man die letzten 5 Jahre gesehen. Man muss auch Investieren können (dürfen!) damit man in Zukunft eine Chance hat. Der IWF stimmt dem zu.

http://www.slate.fr/lien/31169/julian-assange-viol  
  
Lors d’un voyage d’affaires à Stockholm en août dernier, Assange a eu des relations sexuelles non protégées avec deux femmes (un compte-rendu étrange et douloureusement détaillé est disponible sur le site du Daily Mail) qui, après s’être rendu compte qu’elles venaient de faire l’amour avec «le» Assange de Wikileaks, ont contacté la police ensemble pour se plaindre de son refus de faire un test de dépistage de maladies sexuellement transmissibles.  

A l’époque, l’avocat suédois d’Assange avait confirmé que «la principale inquiétude que les femmes avaient sur le comportement d’Assange… était son manque d’intérêt dans l’utilisation d’un préservatif et son refus de se faire tester à leur demande, pour des maladies sexuellement transmissibles.» (En fait, Assange a utilisé un préservatif avec l’une d’entre elles, mais il s’est déchiré).  
  
Il s’agit apparemment d’une zone d’ombre dans la loi suédoise. Si «le consentement des deux femmes a été confirmé par le procureur», comme l’écrit un ancien avocat du fondateur de Wikileaks dans une tribune passionnée, Assange est poursuivi pour un délit appelé «sexe par surprise», qui serait passible d’une amende de 715 dollars (536 euros) selon lui.

Griechenland hat in den letzten Jahren die Staatsausgaben um ein Drittel gesenkt. Mangelnden willen zu ""sparen"" kann man denen jetzt nicht wirklich vorwerfen. Es zeigt sich halt leider nur, dass bei einer Volkswirtschaft der Sparwille nicht mit dem Sparerfolg korreliert. Die sollen sich weiter in die Krise/Depression ""sparen"" und da hat die Regierung unter Tsipras verständlicherweise etwas dagegen.

Eine Revolution. Wir lernen in der Schule ja auch nichts vom ""Französischen Putsch"". Hier die gute alte WP:

&gt; Ein Putsch[...] ist eine oft überraschende, meist gewaltsame Aktion eines Teils der Staatsorgane (oder einer Gruppe davon; oft handelt es sich z. B. um das Militär oder einen Teil davon) mit dem Ziel, die Regierung zu stürzen und die Macht im Staat zu übernehmen. [...] Häufig folgt auf einen Putsch eine Militärdiktatur oder die Herrschaft eines autoritären Regimes.

Hier wurde weder überraschend gehandelt (Protesten liefen seit Monate), noch war das Militär beteiligt, noch ist die Ukraine eine Militärdiktatur oder autoritär.

Dass Gewalt im Spiel war und dass Janukowitsch nicht verfassungsgemäß gestürzt wurde ist bekannt und im Wesentlichen unbestritten. Das macht das Ganze aber nicht zu einem Putsch.

&gt;  Hier wird man aber direkt downgevotet wenn man sagt, dass die jetzige Ukrainische Regierung eine Putschistenregierung ist

Weil das nicht stimmt. Sowohl Parlament als auch Präsident sind in freier und demokratischer Wahl gewählt worden, die Rada war die ganze Zeit frei gewählt. *Selbst wenn* es sich vorher um einen Putsch gehandelt hätte ist demokratische Legitimation auf jeden fall voll wieder hergestellt. Der Artikel lügt wenn er die Wahlen als ""umstritten"" ankanzelt, sie sind international (auch aus Russland) als frei und demokratisch anerkannt worden.

&gt; dass der Osten des Landes dadurch ein nachvollziehbares Interesse hat, sich von denen nichts sagen zu lassen.

Und genau wie der Artikel misst Du mit zweierlei Maß: Wenn die Ereignisse auf dem Maidan ein Putsch sind, warum ist ein bewaffneter Aufstand im Osten denn plötzlich legitimiert? Insbesondere wenn hier wesentliche Anführer (Girkin, Bezler,...) Ausländer sind.

&gt; Wenn in Berlin morgen ein Putsch stattfinden würde und danach eine Russlandfreundliche Regierung installiert wird, dann würden im Ruhrgebiet aber ganz schnell NATO Panzer auflaufen, so wie die Russenpanzer an der Ostgrenze der Ukraine auftauchten.

Mit dem kleinen Unterschied dass Deutschland ein NATO-Staat ist, die Ukraine aber neutral war und dass die Russenpanzer auf der *falschen* Seite der Grenze auftauchen.

Im Übrigen ist der Artikel natürlich der übliche Mist, ein Mix aus wertenden Begriffen (""eingesetzte Regierung""), Verdrehungen (""Separatisten im Süden und Osten beteiligen sich nicht"" - Seps sind nur im äußersten Osten, im Süden wurde gewählt), Halbwahrheiten (""Soldaten ohne Hoheitszeichen sichern die Wahl"" - es sind Russische Soldaten und sie erzwingen die Wahl) und Auslassungen (Merkels Einschätzung zur Annexion der Krim ist inzwischen völlig überholt) der ein Narrativ vorgaukelt dass mit den Fakten wenig zu tun hat.

Wenn das Ergebnis des Referendums nicht der Regierungslinie entspricht, hat die Regierung kein Mandat für ihr Programm mehr. Folgerichtig muß sie zurücktreten, anstelle ein ""falsches"" Programm ugegen ihre Überzeugung umzusetzen. Besser, den Weg für eine andere Regierung freizumachen.

Ebenso ist es gut, transparent zu machen, unter welchen Umständen man weiterregiert. Parteien in der pluralistischen Demokratie ""wirken bei der politischen Willensbildung der Bürger mit"".

Es wird abgestimmt über das letzte Angebot der Troika. 2011 lehrt, daß es vorher nicht möglich war, ein echtes Ergebnis abstimmen zu lassen.

Wieso gehst Du davon aus, dass ich etwas falsch verstehe oder verstehen möchte? Ich glaube nur, dass du es dir ein wenig zu einfach machst mit deinem ""Wenn ein Mitarbeiter so unersetzbar ist, dass alles den Bach runter geht wenn er von heute auf morgen nicht mehr da ist, dann stimmt etwas in der Firma nicht"". Ja natürlich hast Du _irgendwo_ recht. Aber gleichzeitig checkst Du nicht, dass die Kündigung eben nicht der einzige Grund ist, warum Reddit gerade durchdreht. Ein Link wo alles ein bisschen näher erklärt wird steht irgendwo oben. Was Du damit anfängst ist deine Sache, es hilft aber ungemein in einer Diskussion wenn alle über den gleichen Kontext reden.

&gt; Il désire que le parlement grec nomme des interlocuteurs qui peuvent commencer à discuter et accepter les mesures transitoires car celles-ci seront urgentes. Et Syriza ne sera pas vraiment en position de donner des interlocuteurs acceptables

Il veut des gens qui acceptent ce qu'il propose. C'est peu ou prou la même chose.

&gt; Sincèrement, ceux qui lancent un référendum en 8 jours,

En effet, c'est pas l'idéal. Le pire serait de le faire sans consulter le peuple. Et le calendrier serré, pour qui a suivi un peu ces histoires, il n'est pas imposé par la Grèce. Elle n'a pas arrêté de demander à ce qu'on sorte de l'urgence et qu'on puisse discuter posément. Syriza n'a pas cessé de faire des coupes dans son programme dans l'espoir d'obtenir un temps mort, sans jamais l'avoir.

C'est pas eux qui disent que ça doit se décider en 8 jours! Et l'Europe dit que c'est intolérable de devoir attendre autant de temps! 

C'est franchement pas l'idéal mais je donne mille fois raison à Tsipras sur ce coup là: il n'a été élu ni pour prolonger l'austérité ni pour sortir la Grèce de l'euro. Il demande un mandat pour ça et il se tourne vers le peuple pour le faire. Qu'en Europe on ne comprenne pas cette démarche, ça me donne franchement envie de voter anti-Union Européenne.

Nato e cresciuto in una famiglia molto attenta agli animali, ma senza essere vegetariani. Sempre avuto cani vicino, che consideravo come fratelli e allevato non so quanti uccellini caduti dal nido e rimessi in libertà.

Questo, unito alle letture e alla passione per la filosofia che avevo allora, mi ha spinto verso la scelta del vegetarianesimo.

&gt; Perchè non vegano?

Ci ho pensato varie volte e sono sempre tentato, ma ho paura di non riuscirci (sono un tipo che tende a godersela un po'. Come farei senza aperitivi, o se dovessi stare attento ad ogni cosa che ingerisco, soprattutto quando esco?) e, automaticamente quindi, anche un po' di pigrizia. 

Ci sarebbe l'opzione di diventare ""vegano a casa"", è la scelta che vedo più vicina, ma c'è la mia ragazza che è quasi-vegetariana, ma di passare a mangiare vegano a casa non se ne parla. Si finirebbe a spesa divisa e cucinare divisi e cazzi vari... Non c'ho voglia di pensarci per adesso (anche se gliel'ho già proposto qualche volta).

&gt; c'est surtout que tu ne sais pas ce que veux dire rouler sur la dette

Suis pas d'accord avec le point de vue donc forcément idiot? Suis mathématicien pas économiste certes mais le concept de rouler sur la dette est pas lié ici. Le fait est que l'argent qui aurait du être remboursé ne le sera pas (sous forme d'intérêt ou d'autres), après dans quel case ça apparait dans le bilan comptable c'est pas très important.

&gt; mathématiquement parlant la Grece ne peut rembourser à cette allure, elle est condamnée dans une spirale récessionniste, sans restructuration de la dette, ca ne fera qu'empirer (pas comparable à la situation francaise par ex)

Assez d'accord que la situation de la Grèce est un peu peine perdue avec les plans actuels proposés. Cela dit, je ne vois pas les autres pays de la zone euro en bien meilleure posture. La dette française (en % du PIB sinon tu vas encore m'accuser de rien comprendre) continue à se creuser malgré tous les plans gouvernementaux, et je vois pas vraiment comment on évitera le défaut nous aussi, même si c'est seulement qu'à moyen terme (donc pas important?).

Tra i vari problemi della tua proposta (abbandonare l'Euro e innalzare dazi all'entrata, se ho capito bene), te ne cito alcuni:

- i tempi per sostituire l'utilizzo di carburanti fossili con fonti di energia rinnovabile (sempre che sia possibile farlo in maniera piu' significativamente maggiore di oggi) sarebbero molto lunghi, nel frattempo l'impatto dei costi maggiori per petrolio e gas sarebbe immediato e duraturo.

- non e' necessariamente vero che le aziende italiane si metterebbero ad investire in prodotti piu' efficienti; grazie ai nuovi dazi infatti avrebbero comunque a disposizione dei consumatori che non hanno scelta se non comperare quello che producono loro. La verita' e' che nei paesi dove sono presenti dazi all'ingresso quelli che ne soffrono di piu' sono proprio i consumatori interni.

- se tu metti dei dazi all'entrata in Italia, il resto del mondo mettera' dei dazi all'uscita. Quindi anche l'export italiano sarebbe colpito pesantemente.

- computer e telefonino sono solo degli esempi. Verifica tutto quello che trovi a casa tua e che non e' stato prodotto all'estero, o prodotto in Italia ma con materie prime o componenti provenienti dall'estero. Mi sa che a parte le ciliege colte dall'albero sotto casa trovi proprio poco.

Apparte questo come puoi vedere [qui](http://www.ilpalio.org/cavalli2000bis.htm) i cavalli non corrono per tantissimi anni e non di certo perchè muoiono.

Per quanto riguarda il resto... Ti assicuro che quando un cavallo muore è un evento assolutamente tragico non solo per la contrada a cui era stato assegnato il cavallo (e che quindi non potrà più partecipare alla corsa vera e propria), ma per tutta la città. I cavalli del Palio a Siena vengono trattati bene. Potrei passare molto tempo a descrivere il rapporto d'amore che hanno i contradaioli per il loro cavallo.

La morte di un cavallo in una batteria di prova è una cosa assolutamente orribile e ingiustificata e che probabilmente poteva essere evitata. Non voglio dare tutta la colpa al fantino, ma beh sì è in gran parte colpa sua, colpa di un fantino giovane e montato che ha spinto un po' troppo un cavallo in una batteria di prova -cosa che non ha senso-. 

&gt;Quindi, fanno bene gli animalisti a lamentarsi?

In questo caso ci può a stare, perchè come ho detto secondo me poteva essere evitata. In generale no. Non ha senso vietare il Palio perchè altrimenti ogni gara di equitazione andrebbe vietata, dalle corse di velocità negli ippodromi alle corse ad ostacoli.

Ho letto questi giorni: ""La pista del palio di Siena è una trappola mortale per cavalli!!!"" o anche ""il terreno non è adatto!!!!"" o il top: ""solo nel Palio di Siena muoiono i cavalli, nelle altre corse no""

Vi pregherei di andare a visitare questo sito: http://www.horsedeathwatch.com/ (che come potete notare non raccoglie di certo tutti decessi nelle corse) o anche [qua:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racehorse_injuries#Risk_Factors)

Tutte le corse di cavalli sono pericolose e il Palio non è poi così pericoloso rispetto al resto considerando che il Palio viene fatto solo 2 volte l'anno. Inoltre bisogna far notare che i cavalli devono avere [delle determinate caratteristiche genetiche, devono sottoporsi ad adeguati allenamenti, etc](http://www.comune.siena.it/content/download/32898/474129/file/Protocollo%20per%20l%27addestramento%20dei%20cavalli%20da%20Palio%20per%20l%27anno%202015.pdf) e che in ogni caso vengono sottoposti a dei rigidi controlli. Siena ha inoltre una delle migliori cliniche veterinarie attrezzate per ogni tipo di eventuale infortunio. Il problema dei cavalli è che spesso le fratture non possono essere ridotte e che quindi bisogna abbatterli perchè passerebbero il resto della propria esistenza senza nemmeno poter stare in piedi. I cavalli che vengono salvati invece passano la vita in [pensioni super attrezzate](http://www.comune.siena.it/La-Citta/Palio/Tutela-del-Cavallo/Il-Pensionario).",null,0,null,1435938009,null,0,false,0,csr2kdw,null,t3_3bz7lp,null,t1_csr2kdw,null,t1_csqwkuq,null,null,null,1440502233,null,5,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,5,null

Affetti sottilmente lo zenzero e lo metti a rosolare come fosse cipolla. Nel frattempo metti a mollo cubetti di tofu nella salsa di soia chè altrimenti non sa di un cazzo. Quando lo zenzero ha rosolato per bene, ci aggiungi tofu e salsa di soia e lasci sul fuoco qualche minuto finchè non si asciuga e diventa quasi cremoso. A quel punto lo aggiungi al riso cotto a vapore, in teoria. Viene piccante (più che piccante forse ""pungente"", per lo zenzero) e orientaleggiante. Non mi stanca mai.

Oui, ça fait un peu athéiste extrémiste, mais juste pour remettre les choses à leur place, je ne suis absolument pas contre la religion, tout le monde peut croire ce qu'il veut, tant qu'on ne lui impose pas. Et dans la mesure où les parents ont une grande influence sur les mineurs, cela revient à forcer le choix de l'enfant.

Sono contento di sapere che anche in Italia si stia lentamente diffondendo il morbo :) Una cosa che amo del Regno Unito e' che essere vegani e' normale, mentre in Italia se prendi un piatto senza carne al ristorante arrivano inevitabilmente decine di domande e battutine del cazzo (sono stato chiamato frocio svariate volte, solo ed esclusivamente da italiani, pur vivendo a Londra). Spero che la situazione cambi velocemente anche perche' prima o poi vorrei tornare in Italia.

&gt; si si, non mi da fastidio quello, mi da fastidio che qualcuno cerchi di convincermi a non mangiare della gustosissima carne

&gt;mi da anche fastidio quando dicono bugie tipo ""la carne senza condimento fa schifo"" e cazzate di questo tipo

Mi sembra che ti causino un fastidio esagerato qualunque cosa dicano. Per una volta mettiti nei panni della stragrande maggioranza di vegani come me che non fa altro che subire battutine, e sopporta quel vegano l'anno che incontri e ti fa girare le balle per 15 secondi :P

E comunque se un vegano ti dice che la carne senza condimento fa schifo, non puoi semplicemente rispondere che non e' vero e portare degli esempi, o dire che i gusti non si discutono?

Ahahah, figurati! Dovrei ritoccarlo, soprattutto farne una versione in bassa res, ma in questo periodo non ho avuto tempo...

&gt;Ti è capitato di mangiare carne/pesce, consapevolmente, per via di qualche caso ultra eccezionale?

Anni fa ho preso un pezzo di focaccia a Camogli pur sapendo che c'era lo strutto. Ho mangiato qualche caramella gommosa e non parliamo della Conniglia. Carne e pesce nel ""vero"" senso del termine no, mai capitato.

&gt;Ti è capitato di mangiare carne/pesce INCONSAPEVOLMENTE?

Un po' di volte sì. Aperitiveggi e mordi una tartina che ha dentro un gamberetto, in Sicilia chiedi un panino senza carne né pesce e si stupiscono quando, dopo un morso, gli fai notare che l'acciuga sì, è considerata un pesce, etc.

&gt;Se sì, come hai reagito poi? (entrambi i casi)

Be' quando l'ho fatto consapevolmente, viste che erano eccezioni minime, me ne sono fregato. Quando capita incosapevolmente pure. Alla fine io ce l'ho messa tutta, se poi sbaglio senza volere, mica è colpa mia. Passo il cibo ad un mio amico e prendo qualcos'altro. Se l'alternativa fosse buttarlo probabilmente lo mangerei.

Comunque no, non corro a vomitare nel bidone più vicino.

&gt;Cosa eviti di mangiare tra i derivati della carne?

Tutto, altrimenti non potrei definirmi vegetariano.

&gt;Fai altri sport oltre il calcetto? Se sì, come integri le proteine altrimenti derivate dalla carne?

No, purtroppo no. L'anno scorso correvo molto e per due anni mentre vegetariano, all'inizio, giocavo a calcio. Non ho mai avuto problemi. Integro con una dieta variegata e bilanciata. 

Quando divenni vegetariano mia madre mi fece degli esami, per poi paragonarli a quelli presi mesi dopo. L'unica carenza seria è quella del ferro, ma è ereditaria e pure mia madre ce l'ha anche se non è vegetariana. Inoltre sono allergico al ferro e quindi non posso integrarlo :D

&gt;""1. Wir haben privaten Gläubigern Griechenlands ermöglicht, ihr Risiko über Jahre bei uns abzuladen. Überraschung! Sie wollen es nicht zurück. Dies wird einen dritten Bailout nötig machen.

&gt;2 . Wir haben die Schuldenquote am Bruttoinlandsprodukt so sehr erhöht, dass sie nicht mehr tragfähig ist. Wir (das heißt, ihr Europäer) mussten deshalb das, was Griechenland tatsächlich für die Schulden bezahlt, senken und strecken. Das ist jetzt das viel sinnvollere Maß für die Schuldenlast.

&gt;3 . Machen Sie sich auf eine weitere Überraschung gefasst! So gesehen, waren die von uns zuvor angenommen primären Haushaltsüberschüsse, Privatisierungserlöse und so weiter zu riskant. Also haben wir eine Idee, die wir den europäischen Steuerzahlern nahebringen wollen.

&gt;(Anmerkung - an dieser Stelle entwirft der IWF ein Szenario, in dem die Laufzeiten der von der EU an Griechenland vergebenen Kredite ebenso wie die zins- und tilgungsfreien Perioden verdoppelt werden)

&gt;4 . Erinnern Sie sich, dass wir uns von vornherein nur in Griechenland einmischten, weil wir das für systemwichtig erklärten, obwohl zweifelhaft war, dass wir das Geld zurückbekommen würden? Das machen wir nicht nochmal. Witzig genug, wir denken so, weil Regierungen Verluste besser verkraften können als Banken. Ach, falls Sie es noch nicht bemerkt haben, wir sind ziemlich scharf auf diese Verdopplung der Laufzeiten europäischer Kredite.

&gt;5 . Das fängt ja schon mal an, nach einem Plan zu klingen. Unter den gegebenen Umständen haben wir unser Bestes versucht, das Risiko zu berücksichtigen, dass Wirtschaftswachstum und Haushaltsüberschüsse geringer ausfallen als wir denken. Wir schätzen, dass der Plan uns nicht um die Ohren fliegt, solange Griechenland Primärüberschüsse von mehr als 3 Prozent abliefert.

&gt;Ach, warten Sie. Kann irgendeine griechische Regierung dieses Niveau von Überschüssen gegenüber ihren Wählern politisch rechtfertigen? Oh je.

&gt;6 . Also, wenn das schiefgeht, dann werden wir die Regierungen, die im Jahr 2010 bilateral Geld an Griechenland verliehen haben, bitten müssen, mehr von ihrem Geld zu verlieren. Und mit mehr von ihrem Geld meinen wir genauer gesagt all ihr Geld.""

tl;dr:
&gt;Wir können theoretisch keine Zerfallsgleichung bestimmen und auch experimentell keine allgemeingültige Gleichung beweisen. Als Lehrer kann man sich auf den Standpunkt stellen, dass die Exponentialfunktion eine didaktisch sinnvolle Elementarisierung des Bierschaumzerfalls ist. Bei den großen Messfehlern ist das auf den ersten Blick einigermaßen passend, insbesondere wenn man mit der Messung verspätet startet oder früh endet, so dass man nur eine Phase misst. Dennoch erhält man bei guter Messung meist Zerfallskurven, die zwei Phasen haben. Der biexponentielle Verlauf wäre hier eine Elementarisierung, die den Messwerten besser entspricht und besser theoretisch mit den zwei Phänomenen Drainage und Blasenvergröberung begründbar ist. 

Also der Zerfall ist in 2 Phasen aufgeteilt, daher reicht eine einzige Gleichung wie in den üblichen Matheaufgaben nicht aus, außerdem lässt sich keine wirkliche allgemeingültige Gleichung finden weil es dann doch zu grobe Messunterschiede (=Fehler) gibt.

Anche durante l'età adulta?

&gt; Riguardo le scimmie non ho idea quale sia il tuo punto, sono onnivore quindi non possono essere considerate nel mio precedente ragionamento su come animali carnivori abbiano bisogno di carne e vivere accanto a dei cani possa far razionalizzare a qualcuno che mangiare carne non sia sbagliato.

Capisco quello che intendi. Il cane è carnivoro, deve mangiare carne. Le scimmie e noi che deriviamo da loro, sono onnivore, quindi possono vivere anche senza carne. Poi, di nuovo, si tratta pur sempre di sopravvivenza: fossi sparato nel medioevo e ci fosse una carestia di frutta e verdure o durante certi periodi non ci fosse null'altro, a quel punto subentra la legge della natura: porchetta per tutti! 

&gt;Cambiando discorso e ignorando tutto il resto(non ho visto se è già stato chiest sry), se hai / avrai dei figli intendi avere piatti separati ai pasti per le vitamine presenti solo nella carne o utilizzeresti piuttosto integratori (che diciamocelo sono fatti da prodotti animali)?

Ammetto che è qualcosa a cui non ho mai pensato seriamente, perchè non saprei come farei. Probabilmente mi informerò parecchio, chiedendo al medico, e seguirei i suoi consigli, dando a mio figlio il minimo necessario di proteine animali che gli servono per lo sviluppo.

----------

Di fatto una religione non è mai né nata così dal nulla né è mai calata dall'alto su un'altra realtà come un unico pacchetto, ma si trova sempre a fare i conti con una cultura preesistente.

Per quanto ci si sforzi, sarà sempre influenzata sia dalle culture circostanti e precedenti alla sua nascita, sia dalla cultura su cui viene eventualmente trapiantata, perché la mente umana non può diventare tabula rasa.

Prendi ad esempio lo stesso Agostino, padre della Chiesa e una delle figure più influenti del pensiero occidentale: per quanto avesse rinnegato il manicheismo di cui era stato adepto, ne rimase traccia nella sua mentalità fortemente dualista e pessimista verso la materia, in opposizione, che so, a Pelagio che invece aveva una visione a mio personalissimo parere più sana dell'umanità, senza nulla togliere all'eccellenza che Agostino ha raggiunto in altri campi.

Quindi, anche senza volerlo, il manicheismo ha finito per influenzare indirettamente il pensiero ecclesiastico e filosofico medievale in genere, rispuntando fuori in movimenti quali i Bogomili nell'Europa dell'Est, nei Catari/Albigesi in Provenza (che ebbero l'onore di essere l'oggetto dell'unica crociata all'interno dell'Europa stessa), ecc.

Poi bisogna considerare le aree di influenza diretta dello Stato pontificio e fare il contrasto con le parti di Italia che per secoli non ne hanno fatto parte (tipo la Repubblica di Venezia).

Poi mancano IMHO gli strumenti per fare una misurazione precisa: possiamo, forse, sapere quanti e quali testi sono stati copiati in un certo periodo in una certa area, ma non abbiamo idea di quanto questi fossero recepiti dal grande pubblico, che era per la maggior parte analfabeta e non abbiamo idea dei contenuti delle omelie, generalmente parlando.

Non sappiamo quanta gente frequentasse le chiese e non possiamo sapere cosa ci fosse davvero nella testa delle persone, quante di queste ci credessero veramente e quante no, ecc.

**Sulla questione del monoteismo:** il Dio cristiano è il Dio dei filosofi, infinito, onnipotente, eterno, onnisciente, ecc., cosa che non è scontata nella Bibbia, che secondo me gioca un ruolo secondario nell'elaborazione della teologia.

Sin dagli inizi del Cristianesimo, i primi teologi hanno dovuto fare i conti con l'élite culturale pagana, per provare a convincerla che non era il solito culto rozzo e barbaro, usando i mezzi delle filosofie che andavano per la maggiore, cioè neoplatonismo, stoicismo, ecc., magari anche ""senza farlo apposta"", per il motivo di cui sopra, cioè che le religioni non nascono dal nulla e devono fare i conti con le culture che incontrano, venendone condizionate: erano semplicemente idee che circolavano negli ambienti culturali dell'epoca.

Poi è chiaro che ""ritornare"" alla lira significa in realtà adottare una nuova moneta nazionale con tasso di cambio iniziale di 1:1 sull'euro. Solo un pazzo utilizzerebbe il vecchio tasso di cambio di 1936,27. È chiaro che poi sui mercati internazionali la lira comincerebbe a svalutarsi, d'altronde il differenziale accumulato in questi anni è molto alto (non ho i numeri sotto mano quindi non ti posso dare il valore preciso). Ci si attende una svalutazione del 40% circa, di cui secondo gli studi circa il 30% (nel senso, il 30% di 40) potrebbe tradursi in un aumento dell'inflazione, al netto di politiche governative atte a contrastare un aumento esagerato. Ne consegue che la svalutazione ovviamente non si riflette 1:1 sull'inflazione.

""I prezzi dell'energia schizzerebbero verso l'alto"" significa tutto e niente. Ho visto gente dire che la benzina arriverebbe a 4000£/l, una cosa che non sta né in cielo né in terra perché presupporrebbe anche un aumento dei costi di produzione di diverse centinaia di punti percentuali.

Adesso sono da mobile, quindi non posso dilungarmi oltre.

&gt;http://rt.com/news/270853-greek-debt-unsustainable-imf/

&gt;Even if Greece accepted all of the austerity measures demanded by its main creditors, the Troika, it still would not be able to make ends meet by 2030, according to IMF estimates revealed in a set of documents obtained by a German newspaper.

&gt;The most optimistic scenario shows that Greece would face an unsustainable debt in 2030 even if it agreed to the package of tax increases and spending cuts proposed by the European commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF in exchange for a five-month €15.5bn loan from its creditors.

&gt;These prospects were outlined in six documents that were part of the “final” proposal offered to Greece by the three main creditors on Friday. The papers were obtained by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and seen by The Guardian.

&gt;The estimates provide support for Greece’s decision not to accept the bailout deal. They prove that for Greece to survive economically, it needs real debt relief measures, not austerity reforms.

&gt;According to the IMF, Greece would be unable to sustain a debt level of 118% of GDP. In 2012, the organization said that 110% of GDP is the highest debt threshold the country could take on.

&gt;Currently the country’s debt level amounts to 175% of GDP, and that percentage could easily rise if the country were to slip into recession.

&gt;The documents stressed that even if Greece posted stellar economic growth for 15 years, the debt level would still be higher than 110% of GDP, adding that Greece had no chance of meeting that target.

&gt;...

Their GDP *was* that high before austerity, so their salaries *were* in balance with their GDP.

It's obvious that a political union, especially fiscal transfers, is an explosively divisive and unpopular thing in most countries. No one wants to hear about ""losing sovereignty"" or ""never-ending bailouts for the europoors"".  But the issue had to be confronted. The politicians should have addressed it. They should have talked about it, argued about the pros and cons. 

What did they do instead? First of all they presented the euro as something perfect that would have no disadvantages at all. Any concerns were brushed aside instead of discussed. The politicians at the time presented the euro as a free lunch, a cake that you can have and eat it too. 

But even then it was salvageable. When the inevitable crisis came, they made two grave mistakes: 

1. They framed the crisis as solely the fault of the crisis-stricken countries and totally avoided discussing the euro's systemic problems that were in reality a major contributing factor. They framed the issue as a creditor/debtor dispute.

2. They pursued a policy of heavy austerity coupled with neoliberal reforms which guaranteed an extremely slow and uneven recovery. 

What was the result? The people in the crisis-stricken countries grew frustrated and exasperated by the harsh conditions and started hating the people imposing the austerity measures. The people in the creditor countries started hating the ""profligate and undisciplined"" people in the debtor countries and grew frustrated with how they weren't ""reforming"".

Which leads to Greece, which is the worst case by far: It had the biggest problems and was made an example of. Its problems were addressed in a completely short-sighted way: First of all, they were told to bear the full weight of the adjustment in order to save the private institutions that given them the loans that drove them over the edge. The reform conditionalities were equally absurd and focused solely on spending as little money as possible on the Greeks and getting that money back as soon as possible. That strategy led to impossibly harsh fiscal austerity targets and ignoring structural reforms. Which wrecked their economy. With the economy wrecked, the creditors doubled down with the same recipe, causing even more pain in a vicious circle which presently led to the coming referendum and who knows what else it will lead to in the future. 

In conclusion, the piecemeal strategy of creating a true union wasn't bad in principle but the short-sighted way in which narrow nationalist interests were put above all else fucked everything up.

""Back in 2011, I applied for a job at reddit.  In late 2011, after a series of interviews, I received a call from /u/hueypriest offering me the position of Community Manager. 
However, in early 2012, a week before I was supposed to move to San Francisco, I was unexpectedly diagnosed with leukemia.  I spent the next six of seven months in the hospital and received four enormous rounds of chemo as well as a bone marrow transplant.

Eventually I was cured of leukemia (or so I thought) and was finally able to begin working at reddit. About a year went by while I worked (mostly remotely) for reddit, until I was once again ready to move to their headquarters. Unfortunately, weeks before moving, I had relapsed and my leukemia came back, this time harder than ever. 

During this time, I had sat down with Ellen Pao (current reddit CEO) to discuss my future at reddit and when I was able to move. I had told her that it would still be at least a month (but probably closer to 2 or 3) before I was finally able to move to SF, and she said she was 100% fine with that. We discussed my position, and ultimately determined that I would be returning to the Community Management team. I met some of the new members of the team, all was well, and then I flew home on day 3.

Less than a month later, in February of 2015, I received a call from Ellen stating that I was to be terminated in less than a week. When I asked what the specific reason was, she had roughly stated that “because of our discussion, you are too sick to properly fulfill your duties as Community Manager.” (At no point during our meeting was this stated - I had raised concerns about the stress levels of Community Management, but had ultimately decided that it was something I could easily manage.)""

This is going to cause massive institutional change at the IMF, and there is already intense criticism by some shareholders (many of them much poorer than the eurozone) of how the IMF handled the Greek crisis, believing that the bailout was an attempt to save the euro rather than to save Greece. 

Germany has to date been insisting that Greece only gets another bailout if the IMF stays in the programme, but the recent IMF paper on Greece indicates that they will only be involved if the rest of the eurozone writes off some of the Greek debt. I guess the IMF will definitely not be involved at all unless they get paid the missing 30 June money (and that will have to come from the eurozone).

I'll tell you. Not a clear yes or a clear no to a no longer existing proposal. The worst result would be somewhere along the lines of 49/51 or 51/49, effectively dividing the Greek people. Tsipras has driven a wedge through the already fragile unity of his own people with this referendum, and no matter the outcome, the divide among the Greek people will  increase significantly. This will not immediatly subside after the outcome of the referendum. The results are likely to be long lasting and could easily lead to increased violence. 

Call me a fool, but I am taking a scenario of civil war - slim as it is at the moment - into account as a realistic result of this misery. Last week I said to my father 'Tsipras has given his own people a rope to hang themselves with'. At the time I was referring to a possible 'no' vote, yet a slight victory for either the yes or no camp might be the most disastrous outcome here.

    US Congressional Letter to IMF's Christine Lagarde


Makes it sound like a letter from *the US Congress* to Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, in some official capacity.

This isn't an official capacity, and it's not high-level to high-level talks/comminique. 

It's disingenuous, because it gives the impression this is in some way a perspective that has sway in the Senate and House of Representatives in terms of what the US legislature would be amenable to seeing vis a vis IMF policy or US policy towards Greece/EZ - - neither of which are true, as the pedigree (and frankly, total number) of the Congressmembers here entails.

From this article:  http://freenations.net/euro-greece-no-country-for-wise-men/

It is the *brotherly* nations of the Eurozone that have treated Greece like a sinking ship, like an internal colony. It is the EU and the fanatic French Europhiles Lagarde and Strauss-Kahn who have headed the IMF who have screwed over Greece, in contrast to internal IMF reports and objections from the non-Europhiles within the IMF objecting all along about the negative effects of austerity:   
&gt;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11654639/IMF-has-betrayed-its-mission-in-Greece-captive-to-EMU-creditors.html 

&gt;The Greeks accuse the IMF of colluding in an EMU-imposed austerity regime that breaches the Fund’s own rules and is in open contradiction with five years of analysis by its own excellent research department and chief economist, Olivier Blanchard.

&gt;...
 
&gt;Ashoka Mody, former chief of the IMF’s bail-out in Ireland, refuses to criticise his former colleagues on the European desk, but the meaning of the words I quoted last night are clear enough.
&gt;“Everything that we have learned over the last five years is that it is stunningly bad economics to enforce austerity on a country when it is in a deflationary cycle. Trauma patients have to heal their wounds before they can train for the 10K.""
&gt;“I am frankly shocked that we are even having a discussion about raising VAT at all in these circumstances. We have just seen a premature rise in VAT knock the wind out of a country as strong as Japan.""
&gt;“Syriza should recruit the IMF’s research department to be their spokesman because they are saying almost exactly the same thing as Syriza on the economics of this. The entire strategy of the creditors is wrong and the longer this goes on, the more is its going to cost them.”
The IMF’s Original Sin in Greece was to allow the urbane Parisian Dominique Strauss-Kahn to hijack the institution to prop up Europe’s monetary union and the European banking system when the crisis erupted in 2010.

&gt;The Fund’s mission is to save countries, not currencies or banks, and it certainly should not be doing dirty work for a rich currency union that is fully capable of sorting out its own affairs, but refuses to do so for political reasons.

&gt;....

&gt;Yet leaked minutes from the IMF board meetings showed that all the emerging market members (and Switzerland) opposed the terms of the first loan package for Greece. They protested that it was intended to save the euro, not Greece.

&gt;It loaded yet more debt onto the crushed shoulders of an already bankrupt country, and further complicated the picture by allowing one large French bank and one German bank – no names please – to offload much of their €25bn combined exposure onto EMU taxpayers.

&gt;“Debt restructuring should have been on the table,” said Brazil's member. The loans “may be seen not as a rescue of Greece, which will have to undergo a wrenching adjustment, but as a bailout of Greece’s private debt holders, mainly European financial institutions”.

&gt;Arvind Virmani, India’s member, was prophetic. ""The scale of the fiscal reduction without any monetary policy offset is unprecedented. It is a mammoth burden that the economy could hardly bear,” he said.

&gt;“Even if, arguably, the programme is successfully implemented, it could trigger a deflationary spiral of falling prices, falling employment and falling fiscal revenues that could eventually undermine the programme itself."" This is exactly what has happened.

&gt;...

&gt;Consider it a mea culpa submerged in a deep pool of calculus and regression analysis: The International Monetary Fund’s top economist [Olivier Blanchard ] today acknowledged that the fund blew its forecasts for Greece and other European economies because it did not fully understand how government austerity efforts would undermine economic growth.

Il est vrai que nous vivons une époque où les dénominations tous azimuts font bon dos à certaines franges, dont les motivations peuvent être idéologiques ou tout simplement éditoriaux, qui n'hésitent pas à manipuler le champ lexical pour soutenir leurs propres agendas. 

L'auteur rappelle à juste titre que c'est un jeu dangereux, mais pas si facile à démêler. Il s'agit de faire la part entre l'acte terroriste, et le crime à caractère crapuleux. L'un n'étant pas forcément indissociable de l'autre. Le terroriste est peut-être aussi un criminel. Ou l'inverse ? Lorsque Carlos tue deux agents de la DST en 1975, doit-on considérer que nous faisons face à un terroriste qui a commis un double meurtre en dehors du cadre de ses activités ""idéologiques"" ?

L'auteur mentionne John Brown, qui me fait penser à celui d'Abu Nidal, jeune militant socialiste révolutionnaire palestinien qui est devenu par la suite un terroriste mercenaire sans foi ni loi. Jusqu'à quel moment la vitrine politique doit-elle servir d'excuse ? Lorsqu'elle est revendiquée ? Enfin, dans quel dossier faut-il ranger les actes d'individus isolés : terrorisme par proxy ?

Esempi: perché ce ne siamo sbattuti altamente del divieto di creare immagini sacre? O quanti conosci che hanno rispettato il divieto di rapporti pre-matrimoniali?

Per rispondere alla domanda provocatoria: perché hanno attecchito gli aspetti conservatori? Evidentemente una parte della popolazione li ha accettati.

With that said I have been aware - as most of r/europe users proper have - that there have been some problems about moding.

You say your tools sucks and admins aren't listening to you guys.

I trust you

Honestly, you as the mods know the problems mods face way better than non-mods does and if you believe that this was the right move to help you guys improve our common community then who am I as a non-mod who doesn't know your struggles to disagree.

Like I said, there was no time to wait and pontificate and allow people to make up their minds and vote. I would have liked to have participated in a week long discussion regarding the various perspectives, but when you've been watching the crisis unfold throughout the night, and you have to make a decision there and then, you've just got to make a decision and I think we made the right one.

&gt;closing the entire subreddit over a person nobody knows

The dismissal of /u/Chooter was not the primary reason. That was just the straw that broke the camel's back. The reasons were because communication between mods and admins is virtually non existent, and our mod tools are shit. The removal of /u/Chooter was aggravating simply because she was one of the few admins who actually communicated with the community and the mods, and now she's gone and there's nobody really to replace her (apart from some token character and a generic email address which were both added hastily in response to the protest).

&gt;and issues only the mods face

These aren't problems only the mods face. Our inability to moderate effects *you*. If we can't ban users who go around trolling you and spreading around your personal information, then this is a problem that effects you. We need the ability to ban these people and deal with alternate accounts, but currently we can't because the admins ignore our requests and don't give us the ability to do so. This is just one of the many ways the problems the mods face could effect *you*.

Either way, the Wikipedia article you point to [2] shows accurate polls within a reasonable margin of error. In mid-2012 they showed Syriza and New Democracy winning 25 to 30% each. Starting from the summer of 2014, Syriza breaks ahead to right around where the election landed.

Almost 40% of the German economy consists of exports and domestic demand is comparatively weak. When Germany pushes austerity, it improves German exports which already have a huge share in GDP by suppressing wages and domestic demand and credit based consumer spending, improving the German trade surplus which for the last few years has been above EU limits of 6%. In every other country of the world, that won't work though because exports are not almost 50% of the economy. 

There is a good conference that explains this entitled [Is Mercantilism Doomed to Fail?](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLudkhivEgRdhBEyh0mrv-E9v5Y7yAhnOh). If you look at the CIA factbook Germany has a GDP of $3.915 trillion and a whopping $1.511 trillion of exports. Germany has a very unbalanced mercantilist economy compared to the rest of the world highly dependant on exports, with a very weak domestic demand. 

When Germany suppressed wages artificially by having a long wage freeze and even cutting wages coinciding not by accident with the intro of the Euro currency, it artificially improved German ""kompetitiveness"" especially in the EU and eurozone with reduced trade barriers and a single currency. Germany looked and looks at the EU to ruthlessly allow German companies to expand at the expense of the rest of the Eurozone. But for economies that do not have almost 40% of their GDP expressed in exports, such measures are outright suicidal. In Spain and Italy two large Eurozone economies, exports are 20+% of GDP. When you impose austerity, you kill their economies. 
I would highly recommend the talk of the non-chauvnist German economist at that conference:

null,false,Kuklachev,UKRA,Україна!,null,"&gt; Physical aggression against journalists in Ukraine began to decline: the first half of 2015 in Ukraine, experts IMI recorded 23 attacks on journalists, which is almost 11 times less than in the same period of 2014 (249 attacks), and 1.5 times less than in a second half of 2014 (37 attacks).

&gt; The worst region in Ukraine in terms of freedom of speech remains occupied Crimea, recorded 29 violations there, more than in any other region of Ukraine. For comparison, in territories outside the control of Ukraine Luhansk and Donetsk regions recorded 10 violations.
&gt; 
&gt; According to IMI also decreased the number of obstacles to legitimate professional activities of journalists for the first six months in Ukraine there were 34 such cases (the second half of 2014 - 47 cases). There were also cases of censorship and obstruction of access to important information - 25 cases (compared to 39 in the second half of 2014), decreased number of threats and intimidation - 22 facts the first half of 2015, compared to 48 for the previous period.
&gt; 
&gt; As explained Catherine Dyachuk expert of IMI, over the past six months, the highest number of violations recorded in the category of obstruction: ""Of the 34 cases, most occasions journalists were obstructed by the representatives of the judiciary (7 cases), followed by guards, both in private and in public institutions (5). Also ""distinguished"" deputies and staff governors (4 and 3 cases, respectively). Most obstructed journalists in Mykolaiv (5 cases), Transcarpathia (4), and in Kiev, Rovno, Odessa and Kirovograd (3 cases, respectively). ""
&gt; 
&gt; Attacked often during these six months on journalists in Odesa region (6 cases), followed Chernihiv (3) and Cherkasy, Kharkiv, Lviv and Kyiv region (2, respectively).
&gt; 
&gt; Attacked and beaten journalists mostly unknown - 5 such cases in six months. Followed by deputies of village councils and district councils and people in camouflage (3 cases), and the characters of the plot, representatives of the separatist ""LNR"", ""DNR"" and activists - 2 cases respectively.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Despite the quantitative indicators that indicate some improvement in the situation with freedom of speech in Ukraine, the situation still remains alarming. Rather, reduce physical aggression and pressure on journalists linked to the lack of this period, the brightest political events, elections and more or less stable situation in the east of Ukraine. Unfortunately, there are no external factors that would indicate systemic stabilization - refers to the systematic punishment of attackers on journalists investigating such cases. This indicates that the improvement of freedom of speech is more situational, ""- said the executive director of IMI Oksana Romaniuk.

If anything stability comes from the fact that they could afford to continue with a somewhat decent lifestyle. They had a currency with no inflation, no real foreign threats, no real danger other than internal politics and themselves. 

Greece had sufficient access to loans, and incomes sufficient to live by. You don't want to know what it requires to get a loan in a country like Moldova or Ukraine, even in Romania. Living from paycheck to paycheck is the standard in most of Eastern Europe, even for middle classes. It may not be stability that other EU or US has, but for historical and global levels of stability, they're fine. 

It was a stable and manageable situation that in long-term could have recovered if the Greek government was half competent to negotiate. Even debt relief was on the table when it was affordable, coupled with investments from the EU.  

PS: If you are going claim desperation and poverty from the people all you have to do is looking at how they riot. Look at the Ukrainian maidan and to the extent those people went to.

Detective authors: Agatha Christie and Conan Doyle were very popular even in Soviet times (see Soviet ecranisation of [Sherlock Holmes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhujgY6m0RQ)), among 'illegal literature' - Orwell and Huxley obviously. Tolkien while sold in the 80's was only popular in narrow circles. 

So obviously people who read those books have idea of Brits based on the characters described in those books. Those who loved British music of that golden era, was affected by that too.

People who studied history in detail know about the [Great Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Game), Russian and British empires continuous confrontations and rivalry through the XVIII-XIX centuries. Some unpleasant moments like assassination of Paul I and Crimean War coined the phrase ""*англичанка гадит*"", literally meaning 'Englishwomen shits' and referring to Queen Victoria meddling in bad way in Russian affairs.

So there is that.

Also there is a state propaganda term ""anglo-saxons"" referring both to the population of United Kingdom and ex-colonies, mostly USA. So that term describes the new Jewish-Masons sort to speak, who conspire against Sacred Russia (kek).

For those who don't buy propaganda the traits for your people would be derived from the cultural pieces (as I said before), and would be in my opinion: adventurous (in good and bad way), snobbish, brave, polite, cunning and boring.

Con ""no Facebook"" intendo che io proprio bannerei tutte le macro e tutti i vari meme postati, che sono tipici proprio del social network più odiato del secolo. Bannerei anche un buon 99% degli screenshot presi da li (rimane l'1% in cui lo screenshot magari è di un post interessante/importante, ma che è stato cancellato). Per capirci bene, qualche esempio di post che farei saltare in aria nell'ultima settimana: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/3bt1aa/the_gay_after/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/3bsdkc/ottimo_tatuaggio/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/3brhwi/stupro_roma_fatemi_capire/), [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/3bo7q4/mia_mamma_ha_trovato_buzzfeed_a_forma_di_libro/), [6](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/3bnli9/parli_taiwanese/), [7](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/3bmz6y/il_portabiciclette_per_tefono/).   

Con cirlejerk, intendo che sono contro a community alternative ""parallele"" a quella ufficiale. Per esempio /r/300pd (avrei bannato tutti i partecipanti, altro che farne uno moderatore :) ), oppure quella nuova di cui adesso non ricordo il nome.  
Oppure per esempio il fantacalcio di /r/italy, a cui partecipano due persone in croce sulla board che probabilmente verrebbero downvotate ogni volta che ne parlano se non fossero membri ""anziani"" della board, che  ogni tanto esce fuori dal nulla nei thread (mi è capitato di vedere gente che postava un commento sull'articolo, e il commento sotto era ""oh, ma il fantacalcio?"").
O anche solo il downvotare/upvotare sistematicamente roba ""giusto per"" (anche se questo è difficilmente sistemabile dai moderatori), vedi il commento di /u/rocco88 a riguardo.

Altre cose che probabilmente fare sarebbe bannare utenti come /u/bondageparty, perché sono divertenti 1, 2, 3 volte ma poi scassano il cazzo.

Poi, le uniche regole che sono nella sidebar sono ""discussioni di roba italiana &amp; niente calcio"". Ecco, io sarei decisamente più stretto a riguardo. Reddit è una community immensa, uno non ha bisogno di venire qua su /r/italy per chiedere una mano sul telefono oppure sul computer.

La soluzione, nella mia testolina, sarebbe probabilmente di dividere /r/italy in più sub (nonostante in passato mi sia opposto a quest'idea, secondo me ora i numeri ci sono). Idealmente (imho) ci sarebbero /r/italy per le discussioni [serie], /r/itaglia o /r/italymemes per i meme e le cagate da facebook e /r/askitaly per gli AMA e le domande agli italiani. Il tutto moderato più o meno come ho scritto sopra.

/rant

Detto questo, non è che /r/italy mi faccia cagare, anzi, altrimenti non sarei più qua. Anzi, generalmente la considero una buona community. Ma non mi piace la direzione che sta prendendo (l'automoderazione non funziona qua su Reddit, come dimostrato dalle sub grandi ma buone come /r/changemyview, /r/askscience e simili) e ultimamente mi trovo a visitarla sempre meno spesso ^^inb4 ^^e ^^chi ^^cazzo ^^ti ^^vuole.

&gt;By late summer 2014, with interest rates having declined further, it appeared that no further debt relief would have been needed under the November 2012 framework, if the program were to have been implemented as agreed. But significant changes in policies since then—not least, lower primary surpluses and a weak reform effort that will weigh on growth and privatization—are leading to substantial new financing needs. Coming on top of the very high existing debt, these new financing needs render the debt dynamics unsustainable.

http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2015/cr15165.pdf

So, yes, the IMF says the debt becoming unsustainable was likely a result of Syriza's policies. It acknowledges, however, that the situation was precarious previously. 

Either way, to make Greece viable some of the debt needs to go. The problem is the same guys who made the last debt burden unsustainable are in office today.

According to ELSTAT whistleblowers the Greek debt was illegally revised up again and again in 2009 by Andreas Georgiou the then head of ELSTAT who was a political appointee with no proper background in statistics, in concert with the then Greek Finance Minister of the time George Papaconstantinou*. According to the whistleblowers this was done to make a high but still manageable and serviceable debt, into a crisis that could not be managed without inviting Troika intervention. Adding to that illegally upward revision of the debt, the then Prime Minister, who has since fled Greece, George Papandreou, made constant statements to the Greek and international media to the effect: ""I am the leader of a very corrupt country,"" this ruined investor confidence in Greece, destroyed Greek credit ratings and shut Greece from being able to get loans on the international scene at a good debt spread. This left no choice but the Troika way or default(which the comprador political elite would never consider). (Btw the Europhile Greeks of Reddit are all ""I am George Papandreou."" They act like they are victimized by a corrupt country, and support the anti-democratic, unanswerable EU bureacracy and its austerity policies. Papandreou FYI, was the third in his family line of political dynasty. His great-grandfather came to power in Greece not by elections or ballot, but by British tanks and troops after WWII. Earlier this great grandfather also in WWI helped Venizelos form another illegal government in Thessaloniki to join WWI in the British and Allied camp in that war. His grandson is in the same mold of comprador traitor, serving foreign interests, through and through.)

Also other 'austerity countries' like Spain and Italy won't let Greece get away with something they've had to endure as well so are inclined to dig in.
