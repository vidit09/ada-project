Since then the numbers are rising. We had 200k in 2014 and we expect 300k till the end of the year.

As you can see none of the countries that take most are in the south. And if you know that most asylum seekers come from outside Europe and Germany/Sweden dont have border with a non European countries or the mediterranean you know that we take a lot that come from Italy or Turkey/Greece/Bulgaria. 

That doesnt mean there shouldnt be a common border guard an common asylum system but its completely wrong that we dont share the burden with Italy and Greece.

Btw. Germany declines 50-70% of asylum seekers but we cant deport them because they just throw away their papers. Thats means of the 200k last year a lot were illegal immigrants. Every illegal claims asylum in Germany because he gets welfare even if hes declined but cant be deported. Last year we had more Asylum seekers than France, Italy and Great Britain together. So we do our part.

&gt;Ayant vu le massacre immense, le combat,

&gt;Le peuple sur sa croix, Paris sur son grabat,

&gt;La pitié formidable était dans tes paroles.

&gt;Tu faisais ce que font les grandes âmes folles,

&gt;Et lasse de lutter, de rêver, de souffrir,

&gt;Tu disais: « J’ai tué ! » car tu voulais mourir.


&gt;Tu mentais contre toi, terrible et surhumaine.

&gt;Judith la sombre Juive, Aria la Romaine

&gt;Eussent battu des mains pendant que tu parlais.

&gt;Tu disais aux greniers: « J’ai brûle les palais ! »

&gt;Tu glorifiais ceux qu’on écrase et qu’on foule.

&gt;Tu criais: « J’ai tué, qu’on me tue ! » —Et la foule

&gt;Ecoutait cette femme altière s’accuser

&gt;Tu semblais envoyer au sépulcre un baiser.

&gt;Ton œil fixe pesait sur les juges livides,

&gt;Et tu songeais, pareille aux graves Euménides.


&gt;La pâle mort était debout derrière toi,

&gt;Toute la vaste salle était pleine d’effroi,

&gt;Car le peuple saignant hait la guerre civile.

&gt;Dehors, on entendait la rumeur de la ville.

&gt;Cette femme écoutait la vie aux bruits confus,

&gt;D’en haut, dans l’attitude austère du refus.

&gt;Elle n’avait pas l’air de comprendre autre chose

&gt;Qu’un pilori dressé pour une apothéose.

&gt;Et trouvant l’affront noble et le supplice beau,

&gt;Sinistre, elle hâtait le pas vers le tombeau.

&gt;Les juges murmuraient: « Qu’elle meure ! C’est juste.

&gt;Elle est infâme. A moins qu’elle ne soit auguste »,

&gt;Disait leur conscience. Et les juges, pensifs,

&gt;Devant oui, devant non, comme entre deux récifs,

&gt;Hésitaient, regardant la sévère coupable.


&gt;Et ceux qui, comme moi, te savent incapable

&gt;De tout ce qui n’est pas héroïsme et vertu,

&gt;Qui savent que, si l’on te disait: « D’où viens-tu ? »

&gt;Tu répondrais: « Je viens de la nuit d’où l’on souffre ;

&gt;Oui, je sors du devoir dont vous faites un gouffre. »

&gt;Ceux qui savent tes vers mystérieux et doux,

&gt;Tes jours, tes nuits, tes soins, tes pleurs, donnés à tous,

&gt;Ton oubli de toi-même à secourir les autres,

&gt;Ta parole semblable à celle des Apôtres,

&gt;Ceux qui savent le toit sans feu, sans air, sans pain,

&gt;Le lit de sangle avec la table de sapin,

&gt;Ta bonté, ta fierté de femme populaire,

&gt;L’âpre attendrissement qui dort sous ta colère,

What happened was this: Sweden's foreign minister were invited as honorary guests to the Arab league. She was going to talk mostly about Palestine, and the contents of the speech was not contested. Suddenly, Saudi Arabia decided that they took offense against Swedish criticism of the Saudi legal system *in January* (the only concrete response has been that sharia ""protects human rights and dignity"").

As for people not calling non-Muslim terrorism terrorism, that's just wrong once again. The actions of ETA, the IRA or FARC (just to name a few) have always been appropriately referred to as terrorism.

After two or three days of working full time they left. The next days they were forced by the security of the state to come back and they did but only stayed a few hours after which they all went back home. This happened a few more days until the security guys gave up on them.

I don't have any sources to hold the above statement.

Back in those days, in Romania everyone had a job. If you were found not to have one, you were given one by force. It seems though that they don't want to work since they don't have any work ethics. But let's not forget that hardly anyone wants to employ a gypsy because of their bad reputation, they are well known for their laziness.

Another example I know is of a young guy who was 20 years old. He was offered a job in renovating constructions. The salary was well beyond any 20 years old guy would dream of. This gypsy guy worked for 5 hours (didn't even ended his shift) and left saying: I'm not that stupid to work in this enviroment 

And for my personal experience, I can tell that they truly don't have the work ethics. For 90% of them earning money means begging or stealing scrap metal.

I've been around them for straight 2 weeks and talked with people who help them integrate them and its a looong fucking hard work for them I'd say it will take at least a generation or two until they are fully integrated like any other being.

No worries, you will have little to no problems in Austria with Standard German, everyone will understand you.  
That's kind of the point of a Standard German.  

But it may take you a bit to get accustomed to the slight different pronunciations and vocabulary in Austrian German, especially in colloquial context, because not everyone will try to speak ""proper"" Standard German and may speak to a varying degree of dialect.  
I know quite some learners, and they all adapted very fast, so don't be worried.  

If someone notices you can't follow the conversation, they will probably shift over to ""a bit more Standard German"".  
It's more of a range in which you can roam as a speaker. Like so: Dialect &lt;-----------X---&gt; Standard German.  

Depending on the person, the extremes may lie on different levels. I would not expect the persons from SNF to speak Standard German very well, but definitely a lot more than in that video.

Peut-être que ceux qui votent FN considèrent qu'un journaliste de Libé est grosso-modo à associer à ""l'UMPS"" ? La défiance d'une partie de la population pour les classes dominantes touchent autant les hommes politiques que les médias. Faut que je retrouve ce sondage, mais c'est un truc assez conscient désormais, y compris chez les classes dominantes : les médias sont associés aux hommes politiques, qui sont complètement rejetés par une grande partie de la population.

Et si cela ne se voit pas à travers le prisme des médias, les gens ""votent"" avec leur portefeuille. Libération, c'est environ 100 000 exemplaires diffusés de mémoire, en comptant tous les achats institutionnels/d'entreprise. Si tu comptes tous ceux ayant un intérêt à lire une revue de presse quotidiennement pour des raisons professionnelles, je ne suis pas sûr que plus de quelques dizaines de milliers de personnes maximum achètent Libération quotidiennement pour se faire leur avis.

C'est un journal qui survit grâce aux subventions et au soutien d'investisseurs privés qui savent très bien que c'est à perte qu'ils financent cette structure. Et quasiment tous les quotidiens papiers en sont arrivés à ce stade, à l'exception du Monde et du Figaro peut-être. Et encore. 

Donc ouais, je crois qu'il s'en fout, l'électeur moyen du FN, que Philippot refuse un entretien. Tout comme je pense que le citoyen ordinaire s'en fout aussi, autant qu'il s'en fout d'acheter Libération ou l'Humanité, par exemple.

&gt;Quatremer ou un autre c'est effectivement secondaire. 

Je pense pas. Cela fait longtemps que les gens n'associent plus ""le journalisme"" à la démocratie.

The goal there, as in any guerrilla warfare, is to increase the cost of the occupation to the point where it is unacceptable to the occupier, and it was the threat of fighting guerrilla warfare against a populace that was dissuasive.  Germany had limited military resources to expend on an occupation; tying down soldiers would damage Germany's ability to conduct a war.  Arming the populace means that there's no real end to the conflict: there's no way of knowing when soldiers will be shot at.  Kill everyone in the country (which might be one extreme measure), and the invader has gained little of value; he wants to have people submitting to him and working for him, not empty land.  Spread out his military, and he's vulnerable to being attacked by the less-powerful force wherever they choose to concentrate.  Concentrate it, and he gives up control of most of the country.  There's no military base to find, no army to surround and wipe out, no way to rapidly-win.

The [Viet Cong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War) and the [Algerians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_War) won their conflicts; the [Iraqis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War) were perhaps less-successful but still relied upon the fact that US soldiers could not remain in Iraq forever.  All of those had a military that didn't really have other immediate obligations: there was an open-ended occupation that could, assuming sufficient will on the part of the occupier, stretch on for a long time.  Germany doesn't have that: Switzerland knows that Germany cannot conduct a long occupation with many soldiers and makes use of the threat of this to avoid the war.  No prospect of guerrilla warfare without armed guerrillas, and there's no credible threat; it was necessary to have the armed guerrillas to present the threat.",null,0,null,1426150231,null,0,1426151207,0,cpcdpto,null,t3_2yp4fo,null,t1_cpcdpto,null,t1_cpcd0hw,null,null,null,1427716597,null,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1,null

*No Man is an Island* (John Donne)

&gt;No man is an island entire of itself; every man   
is a piece of the continent, a part of the main;   
if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe   
is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as   
well as any manner of thy friends or of thine   
own were; any man's death diminishes me,   
because I am involved in mankind.   
And therefore never send to know for whom   
the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.   

Un autre que j'aime beaucoup et qui me titille la fibre patriotique est *O Star of France* de Walt Whitman (celui qui a écrit le célèbre *O Captain! My Captain!*) :

*O Star of France!*

&gt;I.  
O star of France!
The brightness of thy fame, and strength, and joy,  
Like some proud ship that led the fleet so long,  
Beseems to-day a wreck, driven by the gale—a mastless hulk.  
And 'mid its teeming, madden'd, half-drowned crowds,  
Nor helm nor helmsman.  


  
&gt;II.  
Dim, smitten star!
Orb not of France alone—pale symbol of my soul, its dearest hopes.  
The struggle and the daring—rage divine for liberty,  
Of aspirations toward the far ideal—enthusiast's dreams of brotherhood,  
Of terror to the tyrant and the priest.  

&gt;III.  
Star crucified! by traitors sold!  
Star panting o'er a land of death—heroic land!  
Strange, passionate, mocking, frivolous land.  

&gt;Miserable! yet for thy errors, vanities, sins, I will not now rebuke thee;  
Thy unexampled woes and pangs have quell'd them all,  
And left thee sacred.  

&gt;In that amid thy many faults, thou ever aimedst highly,  
In that thou wouldst not really sell thyself, however great the price,  
In that thou surely wakedst weeping from thy drugg'd sleep,  
In that alone among thy sisters, thou, Giantess, didst rend the ones that shamed thee  
In that thou couldst not, wouldst not, wear the usual chains,  
This cross, thy livid face, thy pierc'd hands and feet,  
The spear thrust in thy side.  

&gt;IV.  
O star! O ship of France, beat back and baffled long!  
Bear up, O smitten orb! O ship, continue on!  

&gt;Lo! as the ship of all the Earth itself,  
Product of deathly fire and turbulent chaos,  
Forth from its spasms of fury and its poisons,  
Issuing at last in perfect power and beauty,  
Onward, beneath the sun, following its course,  
So thee, O ship of France!  

&gt;Finished the days, the clouds dispell'd,  
The travail o'er, the long-sought extrication,  
When lo! reborn, high o'er the European world,  
(In gladness, answering thence, as face afar to face, reflecting ours, Columbia),

This type of translation is incredibly difficult, and you will never, ever get a completely faithful one. A translator has to take account of the following:

* The translation must be idiomatic: that is, as far as possible, it has to be something that people would naturally say in real life. If it sounds like a translation, it has failed.
* Any rhyming scheme should be preserved.
* The meter must be preserved. The song has to be singable (this is especially important for children's shows) and it has to fit the original melody. A translation will need at least the same number of ""feet"" (stressed syllables, basically) and, if possible, the same number of syllables overall.
* When lip movements are visible, the translation needs to sync with the lip movements wherever possible. This is, incidentally, almost never possible, but translators do their best.

Basically, getting a completely faithful translation is less important than arriving at a translation that fits the images and tells the same basic story, or at least fits the images. The most famous example of this was an animated children's series in the 60s and 70s originally called *Le Manège enchanté*. Although it was a joint British-French production, the BBC didn't buy the rights to the scripts; instead, they commissioned new scripts based only on the visuals, to be shown as *The Magic Roundabout*. The English scripts were totally different from the French originals, and even the characters were completely different, but it didn't matter: British children didn't care that it wasn't a translation, and it become one of the best-loved children's show on British television.",null,0,null,1426151044,null,0,false,0,cpcdvlq,null,t3_2yqirg,null,t1_cpcdvlq,null,t1_cpc1luo,null,null,null,1427716672,null,2,false,German,t5_2qq51,2,null

null,false,wadcann,UNSA,United States of America,null,"&gt; The reason why Germany did not attack Switzerland was, because Hitler never issued the order to do so. Plans for an invasion were in place and we would not have hold out longer than France.
&gt;
&gt;Why Hitler did not issue the order can only be speculated, but our tunnels for coal deliveries to Italy and our willingness to buy their gold most certainly plaid a bigger role than our sorry excuse of an army. 

The strategy taken was intended to make the Swiss army and militia hold out longer than France had.  There's no heavy equipment or a huge army required for this approach to be successful.

How long a country can hold out isn't simply calculated by measuring the size of its army or counting how many planes it has.  It doesn't need to formally ""retain control"" over any part of the country to continue resistance.

France [wasn't able to hold out for long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_France) because France never planned to extend the conflict: France wanted to have a traditional battle with uniformed soldiers and visible equipment where Germany was first stopped, then overwhelmed, and Germany was never permitted to enter the areas that France was protecting.  France didn't threaten Germany with guerrilla warfare (nor would extending the conflict have been as much of a threat at that time, anyway).

&gt; Furthermore the army was just hiding in the Mountains anyway, while the population was completely unprotected.

That's an necessary cost of a guerrilla conflict: it's not possible to control where the occupiers go.  It's just possible to inflict harm on them and keep the costs of the occupation above any benefits that they get out of the occupation.  But that's okay: it wasn't necessary to separate the German military from the Swiss population for the threat to be credible.

Non les femmes ne peuvent pas être physiquement présentes dans des manifestations publiques comme les procès.

Sommes-nous trompés par la communication sociale et les ""fausses"" bonnes résolutions qui doivent être prises par la Grèce ? Car en pratique quand un parti veut apporter des résolutions fortes pour combattre la corruption et les magouilles, il est très fortement réprimandé, on se permet même de lui faire du chantage (avec la BCE qui impose un ultimatum alors qu'aucune conversation n'ait eu lieu), on se permet de mettre des bâtons dans les roues à cette Grèce.

Ne serait-ce pas plus honnête, humain, juste, d'aider le peuple ? Ne serait-ce pas plus honnête de la part de l'Europe (ou de l'Eurogroupe) de promouvoir, aider, appuyer le nouveau parti qui cherche avant tout plus de justice, moins de corruption et plus d'égalité ?

Non, au lieu de celui l'Europe (ou l'Eurogroupe) libre, soi-disant ouverte, fait bloc à la Grèce avec la mascarade : ""vous devez payer !"". Est-ce pourtant difficile de comprendre par les politiciens européens (qui ont bien entendu fait de grandes études), de comprendre que si on lutte contre la corruption, pour la justice et pour l'égalité, il sera bien plus facile de payer ?? Est-ce difficile de le comprendre ?

Pour ma part, je pense que la communication sociale est biaisée, qu'on nous mâche que l'Europe (ou l'Eurogroupe) nous protège mais elle protège avant, et surtout, les intérêts du grand capital. Et le peuple on s'en fout : voyons l'exemple actuel avec la Grèce (demain cela peut être la France).

La Grèce propose de lutter **efficacement** contre la corruption... mais l'Europe (ou l'Eurogroupe) ne le veut pas : y'a qu'à voir qui dirige l'Europe : un mec (i.e. Juncker) qui permet l'évasion fiscale et donc insiter les conflits d'intérêts, perdurer les cercles d'influence... **C'est sûr : avoir des règles transparentes, ne pas permettre la corruption et les conflits d'intérêts risque de remettre en cause l'Europe** (ou l'Eurogroupe) actuelle... et par ricochet cela risque de libérer le peuple européen du système opprimant, qu'est le capitalisme.

Pour moi, l'Europe (ou l'Eurogroupe) est spécialiste pour faire passer ""les bonnes leçons"", ""la bonne morale"" mais elle ne veut surtout pas que les propositions d'améliorations, que les mesures fortes prises par un pays, pour un avenir serein, soient prises... c'est le jeu, selon moi, des beaux discours... et c'est notre réalité :'(",null,0,null,1426151532,null,0,1426152149,0,cpcdyv4,null,t3_2yp3m8,null,t1_cpcdyv4,null,t1_cpc66vf,null,null,null,1427716714,null,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1,null

Gesellschaft Schweiz ohne Armee (""Switzerland without Army""- Society.

So far all people's initiatives to abolish the army outright have been rejected. However there were many army reforms which has shrunk the army considerably. During the cold war the Swiss army had 400'000 Soldiers, today there are 140'000. Which is still way too much, compared to Germany's 180'000. 

And the army looses more and more favour in the population. Just recently we rejected the purchase of 22 Gripen fighter jets. This could cripple our air force by 2030. Which already only operates during business hours. 

There are more reforms coming and if the reforms go into the right directions I might change my opinion on the full abolishment of the army at some point in the future.

[Brigadier John Enoch Powell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enoch_Powell) had a brilliant mind and was a great politician.

&gt; Powell was reading Ancient Greek by the age of five and learned it from his mother. At the age of 70 he began learning his 12th and final language, Hebrew.

His so-called '[River of Blood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_of_Blood_speech)' speech is widely misunderstood, have a gander.

&gt; The future Labour leader Michael Foot remarked to a reporter that it was ""tragic"" that this ""outstanding personality"" had been widely misunderstood as predicting actual bloodshed in Britain, when in fact he had used the Aeneid quotation merely to communicate his own sense of foreboding.

Downvote away, or try reading and learning.

Part of his speech on the [Hola Massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hola_massacre) in Kenya:

&gt; Nor can we ourselves pick and choose where and in what parts of the world we shall use this or that kind of standard. We cannot say, 'We will have African standards in Africa, Asian standards in Asia and perhaps British standards here at home'. We have not that choice to make. We must be consistent with ourselves everywhere. All Government, all influence of man upon man, rests upon opinion. What we can do in Africa, where we still govern and where we no longer govern, depends upon the opinion which is entertained of the way in which this country acts and the way in which Englishmen act.

null,false,jrohila,FINL,Finland,null,"&gt; AFAIK the 2009-2010 bailout saved the banks and transferred their private debt to the state. Am i wrong?

You are wrong. The bailout of Greece was the bailout of the Greek state, not of banks.

* The Greek state had been in debt for long, in 2008 the debt to GDP was 105.4%
* The Greek budget had been in deficit for the whole decade, in 2008 it was -6.5% to GDP
* When the financial crisis began, the Greek budget deficit jumped to record high -15.7% to GDP in 2010
* The Greek primary budget deficit in 2010 when -10.1%, they had to loan 34 billion EUR of new money to just function

This is when the first bailout happened, in 2010. In the first bailout Eurozone states and IMF loaned Greece money to **fund the primary deficit** and to **enable Greece to continue paying its loans**. The idea in that time was that the Greek problems were just temporarily and everybody hoped that the economy would recover, however what they didn't know is the extend and dept of the Greek financial problems. Remember that in 2010 not even the Greek state knew how much money it was spending. Nor was there factual knowledge on how much debt there is, because at that time both Eurostat and the Greek statistical office were working furiously to recalculating and going over all the past data and posting corrections after corrections.

Now the second bailout happened in 2012 when it had became obvious that how deep the Greek structural problems were and that there was no chance for it to return to bond markets. The second bailout included extending maturity of loans given to Greece by Eurozone govermeants, but it also included restructuring of private debts. With the restructuring of private debts, the Greek banks took a major hit and needed recapitalization worth 48 billion EUR, otherwise the banking sector in the country would have died.

So to summarize this...

* The Greek state's existing public debt was transferred to Eurozone state by them giving new loans to pay off old loans
* The Greek state's new public debt was financed by Eurozone states by loaning it directly money to fund the primary deficit gap
* The Greek banks needed a recapitalization after Greek default, this is a side track as essentially with default Greece got rid of more debt than it took new.

The important thing that many people don't usually realize that for the Eurozone states, especially to states that had no stake in it like Finland, it would have been much more beneficial not to bailout Greece. Yes the European banks had exposure to Greek bonds, but that exposure was much more smaller than what has been loaned to Greece with the bailout programs. The reason why Eurozone states loaned money to the Greek state was that when you have a primary budget deficit of -10.1%, in real money 34 billion EUR. The Greek budget in total was around 77 billion EUR. Essentially if the Eurozone states would not have bailed out Greece, in 2010 the Greek government would have had to cut 44% of its budget. You can just imagine how hard that would have been.",null,0,null,1426152308,null,0,false,0,cpce46m,null,t3_2ynn0x,null,t1_cpce46m,null,t1_cpcdj5f,null,null,null,1427716783,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

null,false,Juste_pour_toi,null,null,null,"La relation au sein du personnel Air France est très complexe. Y a le désormais connu clivage entre naviguants et les autres. Mais il faut aussi voir qu'il y a une défiance entre pilotes et stewards.  
Au sol tout le monde n'est pas traité à la même enseigne, entre l'hotesse d'accueil, le mécanicien et effectivement le gars de l'informatique.  
  
On présente souvent les pilotes comme arrogants et détachés du reste des salariés. Il y a de ça en effet, au sein de la vie de l'entreprise ils sont à part et l'affirment. Un exemple emblématique est la création d'un Comité d'Entreprise propre aux pilotes il y a quelques années, quand Air France commencait à se restructurer après des années d'opulence (restructuration bien tardive, Air France a vécu quelques années au dessus de ses revenus).  
La grève de l'année dernière montre ce décalage entre la situation des pilotes et du reste des employés. Il faut cependant considérer que les pilotes sont finalement les dernières traces de cet age d'or d'Air France, et qu'ils sont les seuls en mesure de faire valoir leurs droits par la grève (un mécano qui fait grève tu le vires, ou de toutes  façons il ne fait pas grève car c'est déjà un prestataire).  
  
Deux approches face à cela. Dénoncer l'attitude odieuse des pilotes, s'insurger quant à leur égoïsme et leurs exigences dépassées. Ou voir quels sont réellement les risques auxquels leur poste est confronté et soutenir une certaine idée d'Air France qui n'est pas une compagnie low-cost ni une compagnie pétrolière (pour Transavia, un transfert des pilotes Air France vers Transavia était prévu. Sauf que les pilotes sont formés sur des Airbus est que Transavia est équipée de Boeing, pas de transfert direct possible, il faut former les pilotes. Ou les remplacer).  
  
Air France c'est une entreprise qui s'est réformée trop lentement et trop peu, où toutes les équipes au sol ont dit adieu aux petits avantages d'antan: la première classe, quand il restait des places, pour les VRP; le Comité d'Entreprise puissant et efficace proposant des activités de qualité; une stabilité de l'emploi avec évolutions; un prestige... Ce sont deux conceptions qui s'affrontent: Air France doit elle suivre les autres compagnies ou doit elle rester Air France ? Abandonner le plateau repas du midi pour un paquet de chips ? Diminuer le nombre de stewards à bord, moins de frais mais moins de qualité de service ? (avec la pression supplémentaire s’exerçant sur les autres membres d'équipage).  
Plus généralement c'est presque un conflit social interne qui reprend les logiques d'une crise existentielle française, coincée entre l'amour d'un système et la nécessité de le réformer pour ne pas le perdre.

Attitudes toward drinking - I drink, but I don't drink with getting shitfaced as an end goal every single time. Also, my in-laws are upper middle class and went to boarding school, so they often have viewpoints that are very traditional and class-conscious; in some ways much more conservative than I had expected. Very early in our relationship we had an argument over when one is required to apologise (Americans apologise when they feel they're at fault, English people will apologise regardless of whether or not they feel at fault, just because it's what you're supposed to do).

Un rappel : cette crise n'a rien de concret telle que un manque d'une ressource, un déficit d'une connaissance ou autre... rien de tout cela en fait.

C'est pourquoi on ne cherche pas vraiment à sortir de la crise, on ne cherche pas à lutter **efficacement** contre la corruption, contre les conflits d'intérêts et/ou contre les cercles d'influence... sinon il sera bien plus difficile de récupérer ce qui peut au moins l'être.

Se si va a vedere la vicenda, tutto è partito dalla segnalazione di un genitore che ha parlato al Piccolo (che cavalca la vicenda per far vendere più copie) di bambini dell'asilo che ""nominano i genitali"", che esplorano il corpo dei propri compagni, che fanno il gioco del dottore. Poi da lì la cosa è salita a livello politico e questo non ha contribuito a chiarire la cosa.

L'opinione che mi sono fatto: sono frasi estrapolate dal contesto, che però effettivamente sono presenti sulle schede, in particolare nella scheda di gioco ""Se io fossi te"". 

E la cosa mi ha sorpreso non poco, perché era facile immaginare che l'iniziativa sarebbe stata oggetto di strumentalizzazione soprattutto da parte dell'area cattolica e di centro destra, e quindi mi sarei aspettato da delle psicologhe professioniste (le autrici di queste attività) un'attenzione maniacale a far sì che non ci fossero appigli per una strumentalizzazione simile. Perché il target di quello che comunicavano non erano altri psicologi ma un pubblico ben più ampio. E invece hanno lasciato delle frasi che qualunque persona un minimo scafata avrebbe capito sarebbero state usate come macigni per affossare l'iniziativa. Aggiungo che l'attività ""Se io fossi te: ...."" è anche una di quelle più inutili tra tutte, quindi a maggior ragione potevano anche evitare di scrivere quello che hanno scritto.

Insomma, un'iniziativa utile e doverosa come obiettivi affossata principalmente a causa dell'ingenuità di chi l'ha proposta. Inoltre il 90% dei giochi proposti sono talmente noiosi che secondo me sarebbe stata affossata pure da bambini.

Thing is that those aren't based on reality. Back in early 90s there was a huge influx (like nothing seen before) of Romanian Roma and I guess poor Romanians to some extent. We already had sizable and mostly integrated Roma community dating back few hundred years, so all the newcomers (who seemed to almost exclusively deal in begging and prostitution) were seen as Romanians. 

It has gotten so bad that word ""Rumun"" (masculinum of Romanian) has acquired an additional meaning of ""beggar"" and ""Rumunka"" (femininum of Romanian) meaning of ""low cost prostitute"".

While the phenomenon I described mostly disappeared by now, lexical changes are yet to vanish. So yeah, stereotypes of Romanians in Poland are quite brutal and it will probably take some time for them to disappear. 

As far as anti-corruption drive goes I find it very impressive and expect great things from Romania. I can't recall stories about that in Polish media tho, but I don't follow it all that much so I might have missed it.

It is seen as superseded as Gods final word for *muslims*, but it is still explicitly called out as Gods word repeatedly in the Quran, and it is also repeatedly pointed out that Christians should live according to the Gospels. Let me quote from sura 5, The Table:

&gt; 46) In their footsteps, We sent Jesus son of Mary, fulfilling the Torah that preceded him; and We gave him the Gospel, wherein is guidance and light, and confirming the Torah that preceded him, and guidance and counsel for the righteous.
&gt;
&gt; 47) So let the people of the Gospel rule according to what God revealed in it. Those who do not rule according to what God revealed are the sinners.

Note how the Gospel is explicitly stated as having been given by God, and as Gods revelation, and that Christians should follow the Gospels as the word of God as revealed to them.

(The preceding paragraphs deals with the Old Testament / Torah) 

And further:

&gt; 65) Had the People of the Scripture believed and been righteous, We would have remitted their sins, and admitted them into the Gardens of Bliss.
&gt;
&gt; 66) Had they observed the Torah, and the Gospel, and what was revealed to them from their Lord, they would have consumed amply from above them, and from beneath their feet. Among them is a moderate community, but evil is what many of them are doing.
&gt;
&gt; 67) O Messenger, convey what was revealed to you from your Lord. But if you do not, then you would not have delivered His message. And God will protect you from the people. God does not guide the disbelieving people.
&gt;
&gt; 68) Say, ""O People of the Scripture! You have no basis until you uphold the Torah, and the Gospel, and what is revealed to you from your Lord."" But what is revealed to you from your Lord will increase many of them in rebellion and disbelief, so do not be sorry for the disbelieving people.
&gt; 
&gt; 69) Those who believe, and the Jews, and the Sabians, and the Christians-whoever believes in God and the Last Day, and does what is right-they have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.

Note how it explicitly refers to the Torah and the Gospel as revealed by God. Not only is it Gods word, but it also explicitly point out that those who uphold the Torah or the Gospels and believe in God and the Last Day (Judgement Day), and does right, are safe from Gods judgement, and can be admitted to paradise.

Poor atheists like me, on the other hand are doomed to hell:

Let's take a peek at Poland. For instance a slavianophilic far rights will hate anyone who is remotely ""Western"" or ""christian"" or ""jewish"" or anything that actualy doesn't sound Slavian enough (christian-linked will of course hate the neopaganism). They will hate a ""decadent Western faggotry"" and such as well of course. Most of them will also carry a stron sentiment against the Ukrainians for the Volynia, Germans for the II WW, Jews for the claims and anti-polish (in their view) propaganda beeing spread. These stances will mix depending on the actual agenda of the particular group, but in a nutshell there's not a single right wing party that is not spreading a hate toward some kind of people they perceive as an enemy to the ""tradition/nation/country/religion"". Not-a-soul. And when I see rights from other countries I conclude them to be exactly the same (just anti-West changes for anti-newEU for instance, or anti-muslim, or anything and anyone that looks stranger enough).

I was a goody-two shoes, but everyone cut class to go to the demonstrations. Just take a look at the [chart on this wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactions_to_the_2004_Madrid_train_bombings). There was a strong anti-government sentiment in the demonstrations and many people were angry (*hijos de puta* chants were constant). Some people said that we should find whoever did this and bomb the hell out of them. Oh, and the people that thought it was ETA... Well, you heard terrible terrible stuff about the Basque and what we should do to them. People were glued to their TVs those 3 days and everyone went crazy with all the different theories on who did it.

It was a very confusing few days, but in my opinion, the PP was more damaged by their own actions than by whatever the opposition did. They digged their own grave by not being more cautious when the country was still in shock.

The thing is that I hear very often on the Internet foreigners complaining about things in our social system and that they have so much to give away from their gross income to the system, so I think I have to tell them that they choose to live in a solidarity system (or warn them if they are playing with the thought of immigrating to our country) and if they do not like that, well they have the choice to choose another country with another system. On the other hand there are foreigners from countrys, where healthcare is free and they seem to pay nothing for it, while they are paying it through taxes. Either the taxes are high and they care for everything like our public insurences or they are more basic. So there are also people who are not used to pay for healthcare insurences. There are also people who do not know how an insurance works.

In many cases it is for foreigners complicated to understand our system of puplic insurences and the choices to leave it if you earn enough and choose a private insurance.

Many are just not used to it, because there is no public insurence in their own country and they are used to shop for insurences like in the US, there you can get a cheap and very basic private insurence, if you are young and healthy. So I think we have to inform them about the benefits of the public insurence in the long run and warn them that leaving the solidarity system is in many cases not reversible.

&gt;That's actually a problem, since if you earn more than the Beitragsbemessungsgrenze you can leave the solidarity system to a private insurance (and many do).

Well this is a valid problem in our system. I personally think we should not allow anybody to leave the solidarity system. Solidarity is a principle of our society. People who do not like it should choose another country. That does not mean that private insurers can not exist anymore, if people want extras they can add them on top of the public insurence / get a Zusatzversicherung.

&gt;although I don't see the benefits in a triple-digit number of almost equal health funds. Maybe 20 would be sufficient, if you want competition.

I am also not sure if competition is necessary for public healthcare insurence. ",null,0,null,1426156947,null,0,false,0,cpcf181,null,t3_2yjoyk,null,t1_cpcf181,null,t1_cpbd4z0,null,null,null,1427717211,null,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1,null

Given the current low price of oil and money and we still dont have growth it is somewhat scary. The population of Europe is more or less static - which means we do not get automatic growth because of increasing population and it is also ageing - which means people are more fiscally conservative or post retirement and living on a fixed income. Massive public infrastructure works would give a small stimulus, but not if it breaks the Euro. 

In many ways we probably resemble the financial situation in Japan back when their financial system went into meltdown. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_asset_price_bubble  Banks overlent from a bubble and industry not as strong as they thought it was.

Und dann hast du die Eier zu fragen, ob ich mir lächerlich vorkomme? 

Sobald man was anderes als deine Meinung sagt, steigst du aus der Diskussion aus (Putin Thread) oder versuchst mir irgendwas vorzuwerfen. Ich habe dich in diesem Thread und dem anderen nicht einmal heruntergewählt, nur diesen Thread aufgrund des Links zu Ken Jebsen.

null,false,ptitz,NETH,The Netherlands,null,"Imagine an open system with one tree, sitting on top of an infinite carbon deposit. Next to it is a factory that outputs carbon. One tree consumes one unit of carbon every year and turns it into ground deposit.

Case 1: your factory sits idle, the net output of the system is -1 because the tree just sucks up carbon from outside of the system. 

Case 2: your factory takes carbon out of the deposit(e.g. it burns coal) and produces 1 unit, which is immediately absorbed by the tree. Net output of the system is now 0.

Case 3: you chop down the tree and burn that instead. So you produce one unit, but the new tree that you plant in place of the one you chopped down absorbs this unit immediately. Sounds good, right?

Well, the net product of your system is still 0. So you still shift the steady state output +1 unit from the baseline scenario. Whether you burn coal or tree is irrelevant to your output as long as you burn *something*. The only way to avoid it is to have a dedicated second tree in the system, i.e. to have one extra tree where there previously hadn't been none, for every unit of carbon that you output. Or produce less carbon, i.e. shut down the factory. If you just switch to using tree, instead of using ground deposits, your net system output will remain exactly the same. It's renewable, sure, it's sustainable, but it's NOT carbon-neutral. The irony here is that even if you add another tree to the system, it *still* doesn't matter whether you use tree or coal, the only thing that matters is your factory output relative to the total number of trees in the system. It's just simple entropy laws. The video that you posted does not account for one simple thing: unless you actually disturb the system, it acts as a carbon *sink*. It has nothing to say on what those trees were doing *before* you started chopping them down for fuel. Once you disturb them, these trees do *not* act as a sink anymore.

Here's an excerpt from the article:

&gt;On April 20, 1586, in the recently established Spanish colony of Manila in the Philippines, representatives of the church, military, crown, and citizenry met to discuss the conquest of China. There was no dissention in the matter. Everyone present agreed it ought to be done. What needed to be discussed instead was how. And it was, in particular and remarkable detail. The gathering mapped out how many men and ships and muskets and cannons were needed; where cannon balls and bullets could be purchased most cheaply; how much money was required; what gifts ought to be taken; and dozens of other matters to ensure the plan’s ultimate success. It would be, the assembly concluded in a memorandum to King Philip II in Madrid, “all that the human mind can desire or comprehend of riches and eternal fame ….”[1]

&gt;The idea of conquering China was not new to the Spanish. It had begun to take shape in Mexico, or New Spain as it was called, nearly six decades before, when the Orient was still only vaguely understood as lying somewhere on the far side of Balboa’s recently discovered “Southern Sea.” In 1526 the conqueror of New Spain, Hernan Cortes, wrote to Emperor Charles V requesting permission to lead an expedition across the Pacific “to discover a route to the Spice Islands and many others, if there be any between Maluco, Malaca and China, and so arrange matters that the spices shall no longer be obtained by trade, as the king of Portugal has them now, but as Your Majesty’s rightful property; and the natives of those islands shall serve and recognize Your Highness as their rightful king and lord.”[2] Cortes did not specifically mention the conquest of China, but it was likely somewhere in the back of his mind, the final step in the spread of the Spanish Empire in Asia. Just as the conquest of the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola had preceded the conquest of the American mainland, so would the seizure of the islands of Asia provide a base for a move against the Asian mainland itself.

&gt;

&gt;__Wolfgang Hohlbein__ (born August 15, 1953 in [Weimar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar), Thuringia) is a German writer of science fiction, [fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy) and [horror fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction) who lives near [Neuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuss), North Rhine-Westphalia. His wife, __Heike__, is also a writer and often works with her husband. She often comes up with the story ideas and therefore is generally credited as co-author. He is quoted saying it is she who brings the ""fairytale-magic"" to his works.

&gt;Writing short stories since age 15, Hohlbein was first recognized as an author after sending in a manuscript he and his wife had written at a fantasy and science fiction writing contest in 1982. They won and their book, *Märchenmond* (English title: ""[Magic Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Moon)""), was published by *[Ueberreuter Verlag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ueberreuter)*, soon becoming a bestseller and winning several awards. It is one of their greatest successes till today.

&gt;Many of his more than 200 books are translated and published in many European countries as well as in [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea). Yet for many years none of his works had been translated into English, not even the eight [Indiana Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones) novels he wrote. In 2006, *Magic Moon* was translated into English and published in the United States.

Comunque con qBitTorrent (e tanti altri client) basta aggiungere il torrent, abilitare il download sequenziale e poi aprire il file con un player decente (MPC-HC o MPV, ma credo anche VLC funzioni)

EDIT: E no comunque, c'è differenza fra torrent e torrent. Prova a vedere un film 1080p da 2gb (il genere di release che YIFY rilascia) e poi a vedere un BDMux da una 30ina di gb.

....which was a political demand Syriza was making until a few years ago, until they decided to pass themselves as more moderates to be more appealing to Greece's electorate.

The hardest part is the in-laws. My in-laws judge me incessantly. Apparently I'm pathologically obsessed with owning my own property (which I am, except for the pathologically part), and I'm 'entitled' and 'spoilt' because my dad actually made something of his career and now has so much money he doesn't know whether to spend it on us now or just leave it to us when he dies; despite the fact, of course, that my parents haven't spent any money on em outside of birthdays and Christmas in about 4 year, and that was to lend - LEND - me £700 to reach the asking price for a new car.

They keep making comments that my son looks like their side and doesn't look like me. Maybe it's a 'winning genes' thing, but it grates. 'He has his grandfather's thighs.' Fuck you, I was a second row for seven years at secondary school; I think it's safe to say that my son has my thighs, to say nothing of the fact that he's huge and my father in law is like 5'6"". 'If he ever does anything for his country he'll be French.' Shit like that. If France beat England in the six nations it's because they're better, if England beat France it 'was our turn this year'. The jokes about England are thick and fast when we're over there; the Queen, not being truly free, losing to the Americans, being America's bitch, being absent from the EU, not 'getting' the EU, clinging to our pound like it matters, crap food and flat warm beer, poor cheeses (I shit you not that joke was actually made; I couldn't laugh because I knew I could style it out to a believable level of laughing *with* the joke). But given the French inability to take a joke, I know - from personal experience - that if I fire back I'm stonewalled until my wife lectures me and makes me apologise. ""All your kings used to be educated in France before they went over to England. What does that say about your culture?"" ""That's because we owned half of France. We also killed Joan of Arc. *Chin chin*."" ""...."" Which is BS.

– un genitore è stato libero di diffamare un progetto supportato da Università, Comune, psicologi, pedagogisti e insegnanti, intimidendo tutti gli altri genitori con un volantinaggio che parlava di pornografia

&gt;– il quotidiano locale di Trieste è stato libero di chiamare “osé” le proposte di gioco contenute nel progetto, scrivendo un titolone in prima pagina, senza averci mai chiesto informazioni

&gt;– il quotidiano Libero è stato libero di scrivere che in Friuli Venezia Giulia si porta la pornografia nelle scuole

&gt;– esponenti della politica italiana, che ci rappresentano nel Parlamento, sono stati liberi di disquisire del nostro progetto su social network e mezzi stampa sempre senza aver verificato le fonti (e ci domandiamo se quando vanno a discutere di politica estera o quando fanno le leggi, usino la stessa prassi)

&gt;– una troupe televisiva è stata libera di entrare con le telecamere in una scuola dell’infanzia della città senza chiedere l’autorizzazione a nessuno

null,false,boq,BAVA,near Germany,null,"Were the Netherlands and Germany to leave the Euro, their new currency/ies would soar in value, destroying the competitive advantage that makes them Europe's ""sugar daddies"". In the short term, everyone can pat their backs: NL/DE for not having to shell out money, the rest for regaining competitiveness through devaluation. In the medium-long term, the strong currency will hurt NL/DE as jobs relocate to cheaper areas while the rest, without pressure to reform, continues with business as usual until the next devaluation comes. In both cases, the average guy wins nothing over the long term. Especially the belief that the alternative to any kind of transfer union would be for ""us"" to keep our money is deeply flawed. Ultimately, this system, too, is subject to a kind of continuity equation that we can't just brush aside.

The smarter decision is for NL/DE &amp; co. to use the leverage that their potential sugar daddy status gives them: offer very limited transfers (and by that I explicitly don't mean to simply write cheques) under condition of real reform. As the reforming economies improve, everyone wins.

Thankfully, there are still enough politicians who recognise this. For example, I know that tomorrow the committee on European affairs in the NRW state parliament (which, due to the state being almost 1/4 of Germany, is basically the Germany of Germany) will most likely pass a resolution demanding a serious assessment of a kind of common base unemployment insurance that would already go very long way.

Finally, EU funds are not subject to huge waste by corruption and thievery.

I'm not sure whether it's the same in other countries, but in Germany it doesn't really matter which party I vote for, they basically promote the same policy - with the same outcome: stagnating or lowering wages, a split between rich and poor and the corrosion of the middle class.

Things you shouldn't read:

1. Don't read Goethe, It's not that nice to read, 'cause it's a pretty old German. Nobody talks like this. I'm a native speaker and sometimes didn't have a clue what he was trying to communicate. 
2. Stay away from other comparably old books, for the reasons in 1. Even if it's considered somewhat of a classic. You might have trouble with everything form 19th century or earlier times. The only exception I read are the Kinder- und Hausmärchen which are the groundwork for most of the fairytale movies coming out recently.

Books you may consider:

1. Kafka's [Metamorphosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamorphosis)

2. Books by Cornelia Funke. She is widely successful with books for kids and teenagers.

That's all the advice I am able to give. Have fun reading.

&gt; ""If you ignore the wishes and needs of a majority of your population, I will vote for a party you can't ignore!""

The so called 'protest vote' is a direct result of the ever crumbling trust in politics all across the board. It can be directly connected to the ever growing cynicism among voters and the trend of lowering turnout during elections. As long as this breach in trust between politcians and voters does not get restored, the situation will only degrade further as time passes.

In the Netherlands we are seeing a tendency to the far-right *and* far-left. Overall there is a hardening going on in society, with the political center being shattered in the crossfire. I will repeat what I said about this trend before: in the end, this has the potential to utterly *destroy* democracy in a few generations time and we should therefore be very aware of this danger.

The people that vote for the PVV, Front National, UKIP etc. are not the only ones to blame: their trust got eroded by the same people they voted for - which makes them strike back after many years of disappointment. This trend can only be turned when politicians acknowledge that they strayed too far from the people.

Exact, en théorie l'obligation d'Etat est un placement sûr. Mais il y a toujours un risque (minime soit-il), c'est pour cela qu'il existe aussi les intérêts : plus le risque est gros plus l'intérêt augmente (pour le créditeur). Si le risque est minime, plus l'intérêt est bas. Mais en cas de défaut de paiment, tu ne peux plus rembourser. La Grèce a fait faillite, banqueroute... mais on veut le voir autrement.

Le prêt, le crédit, une avance, une option... comporte toujours des intérêts / risques. C'est justement ""le jeu"", le risque est de perdre et le gain est de récupérer sa mise + des intérêts. C'est comme en bourse (où on peut acheter des actions, futures : pas toujours sûr et où on peut aussi acheter des obligations, à priori sûr - mais jamais sans risque).

PS : on ne met pas les français dans la merde à cause d'une Grèce qui vont combattre la corruption avant tout et arrêter l'austérité, ce sont des idées reçues. Par contre, on nous met dans la merde sur le moyen terme en retirant notre liberté de choix (à travers les élections démocratiques).

It won't, but it will reduce the crushing pressure the exchange rate applies to less productive regions of the EZ (ie everywhere except Germany and the Netherlands).

If the rest of the EZ can get back on it's feet, states will start having more revenue, which will reduce deficits.

Frankly, Greece is a case on its own by now and I don't know how they expect to get it moving again. One thing's for certain though, unless they spawn an empire covering half the globe, they'll never be able to pay that money back.

It's just another reminder that there are a lot of clueless people out there today. Far too many people vote based on a single issue. They watched a Climate Change doc. and now they vote 'Green'. They saw a horrible doc. on animal cruelty and now they're voting 'hippie'. They look at the terrorist attacks and now vote 'anti-immigration'. While there's nothing inherently wrong with voting for any of those kinds of parties, it's the uninformed reason for doing it that bothers me so much. Just voting based on a single issue is moronic. Oh, and let's not forget the ""My party couldn't get Law X voted through, but they promised!! Now I'm gonna vote the exact opposite next time!!"" tards. That's just way beyond idiotic. Your party disappointed you in some way so now you're going to suddenly change all your political views from left to right (or right to left) simply to ""punish"" your party? lol

Generalization time.. Yay!

When I talk to older people (Grandparents 80+, parents 55+ etc) they tend to have views on all their party's politics. They will gladly discuss economy, open borders, integration, foreign policy, school reforms, healthcare etc. with you and whether you disagree with them or not, at least they care enough to find out what their party's views actually are and take a stance based on that.

Now, younger people who read/debate politics online probably don't fit into my next generalization, but we're a tiny minority of ""young(er)"" people. The vast majority do not debate politics online. Ever. They don't care if Sweden supports Ukraine, or that Poland is buying military hardware or whatever.

So time to generalize again.. Younger people tend to be clueless about their own parties today from my experience. If you ask a lot of the younger Dansk Folkeparti (Anti-immigrant) voters here in Denmark about their party's views on solving the crisis, how to improve our schools etc. they will have no clue whatsoever from my experience. That's not why they vote for them, so they've never bothered finding out.

It's not just a right winger thing though. I've seen the same on the far left. They're so anti-racist, anti-homophobia, anti-discrimination-of-any-kind, anti-fascism etc. that they really can't vote anything else than far left. It's not that those causes aren't good causes, but if you honestly think they are the biggest issues we face during a crisis, you're nuts. And often they'll be exactly like the right wingers in that they only care about their own little topic. The rest they will usually be clueless about. 

And it goes for the anti-tax crowd as well. They care about lower taxes, but that'll usually be it. And obviously only after they got their own free education. They probably have no clue where those tax money are going to get cut from and what kind of effect that is going to have on a society that's essentially built on taxes. The funny thing about this group is that they'll often agree with you if you mention a shitty school system, bad teachers, underpaid soldiers, old hospitals etc. (They are nice/want to sound nice) but they won't make the connection to lowering taxes at all.. 

Simply promoting things like anti-immigration or anti-fascism or anti-taxes or whatever should never be enough for your party to get a single fucking vote. It's insane. Unfortunately a lot of people simply don't seem to care these days. A single view on &lt;insert topic&gt; is all it takes for a lot of people. :|",null,0,null,1426164127,null,0,false,0,cpcgy3s,null,t3_2yrwns,null,t1_cpcgy3s,null,t3_2yrwns,null,null,null,1427718104,null,22,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,22,null

And are aiming to attract as many on this opposition rethorics. Which has its consequences, as enacting a very harsh collective responsibility view, no matter the data or facts states, or scrapping the idea of ""egality is the foundation for justice"" rule. I find them to be at most dangerous ideas.

Yes, I know. My personal experience might be skewed. But there's very little data or factual agendas for the fars that'd prove me wrong. What is the primal reason behind, whether it's the fail of the social-democrats not beeing a social-democrats (as you and /u/Kaeptn_LeChuck stated above and I mostly agree) or any other, it do not change the main drives for the parties and their supporters.

The situation is not as bad as the 175% of GDP figure suggests. Right now, it's critical, because the IMF loans come due quickly and carry relatively high interest. (It's somewhat similar with the bonds that the ECB and other central banks had bought on the secondary market at the hight of the crisis, but a large share of those payments will be profits that will be returned to Greece, so with those it's more of a liquidity issue rather than about solvency. Still, those payments have to be made.) The bilateral loans from the first program and the EFSF ones from the second are stretched over a very long time with very low interest. A third bailout would essentially turn the IMF loans into EFSF ones, just as it had previously been done with the private sector loans. Once that has been accomplished, Greece's cost for servicing its debt won't be unlike that of most other countries in the Eurozone.

Of course, this is based on the assumption that Greece will make it through the coming months and that the government won't have destroyed the little credibility that remains by the time a third bailout will be negotiated.

The competitive advantage of Netherlands and especially Germany is that they make products and services that the rest of the world want and need. People who buy a new Mercedes are not people who think choosing between Mercedes and Fiat, they are people who are choosing between Mercedes, Lexus and Cadillac.

While it is true that a currency that would be formed from Netherlands, Germany &amp; co. leaving the Eurozone would rise in the value, it wouldn't start a mechanism where Italy, Spain or Greece would become more competitive, it would launch east-sourcing of work from central Europe to eastern Europe and another wave of automation and drive to increased robotization of work in central Europe to mitigate higher employment costs.

What the breakup of Eurozone would do is to isolate countries are left out from the same currency area were Germany is. Their companies would incur currency risk and they would incur higher transactions costs thus making them less competitive against producers working with currency used by Germany. 

Another thing to note is that southern European countries are not as much competing with Germany than with China and producers coming from other developing countries. As long as southern Europe doesn't start to create more startups and put more money on R&amp;D, then they will suffer from stagnant industries and being pushed to lower levels of global value chain.

null,false,Neuromante,null,null,null,"I'll go with the conservative thing, as it seems that most people has already answered to the shorts question. I was trying to put here a pun (shorts question, short answer), but couldn't. Sorry.

Anyway, if you want some insight, historically, Spain has been since the middle ages a very catholic country. We were called back in the day, IIRC, the ""spiritual reserve of Europe"", as the power of the church and the faith of the Spaniards were both huge.

The civil war we fought the last century was, basically, a ""left wing, communist, anarchist, progressist, etc etc"" amalgam of people loyal to the republican government against a ""right wing, conservative, pro army, catholic fascist government."" The fascist side won the war, and 40 years of conservative, catholic and repressive government ensued.

Of course, even today, we still feel the aftermath of 40 years of dictatorship in how the society reacts or behaves on specific topics. The right wing party here in Spain has strong catholic roots, the church has special powers thanks to old contracts with the Vatican and many (mostly old) people are really conservative in a lot of stuff, specially regarding religion and sexual freedom.

The good thing is that this is something that is slowly changing. Most (I want to think) of the people support things like same sex marriage, and most of the (young) people have a ""progressist"" way of thinking (You can see two dudes kissing in the street and no eyebrows raised). There's a counterbalance, of course, but, at least in my opinion, the balance is slowly changing.

So, tl;dr, Spain has a conservative story, but is something that seems to be changing lately.",null,0,null,1426165061,null,0,false,0,cpcha1y,null,t3_2ypa5t,null,t1_cpcha1y,null,t3_2ypa5t,null,null,null,1427718259,null,5,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,5,null

&gt; *Everything must change, and it must change NOW*. 

In general we are talking about the people that are not by definition uninterested in reasoning (although some seem to be unable to reflect on something or look upon it in another light), but that feel valuable time is being lost when the matter drags on and on. And indeed, the issue they want to see solved often preoccupies them. Funny fact is that these people are in my experience much more often exposed to the problem in question than the voters of traditional political parties. I therefore would not immediatly ignore them as their knowledge can prove to be valuable.

I will not deny that hate as a thriving factor applies to a certain subgroup of far-wing voters, but for most of them it seems to be a simple dislike of the issue. Take that issue away and most people will go on with their lives as usual. Hate is a type of crystallized anger that is completely opposite to love, which makes it rather unfit to describe an entire group in my opinion.

&gt;In unsere**r** **G**ruppe hat(**te**) jeder eine**n** andere**n** erste**n** Gedanke**n** bei **dem** Titel **“**Im Westen nichts Neues**“**. Einige **dachten,** ~~den Titel~~ das**s an der** Westfront nichts Neues passier**e**, **als** sie den Titel **zum** Ersten **mal hörten,** das**s an der** Westfront sehr viele Leute starben und das**s** es nichts **aufhörte**/**stoppte,** das**s** da kein**e** gewinnende Partei kam.

&gt;Ist der Titel in diesem Kontext passend?

&gt;Wir finden den Titel in diesem Kontext sehr passend. Im Westen starben die Soldaten in Massen**[…]** und der Bevölkerung wurde durch Lügen wei**ß**gemacht, dass sie siegreich wären. Auch wenn am Ende **der** Hauptdarsteller stirbt, steht an diesem Tag im Kriegsbericht: **“**Im Westen nichts Neues**“**. Es interessiert niemanden**,** dass er tot ist. Auch bezieht der Titel sich auf den letzten Satz von dem Buch. Der Satz lautet: **“**Er fiel im Oktober 1948 an einem Tage**,** der so ruhig und still war an der ganzen **F**ront, dass der Heeresbericht sich nur auf den Satz beschränkte, im Westen sei nichts Neues zu melden.

Well, speaking of lazy assumptions, fuck right off with that sneakily de-humanizing language. *I* assume ""something something SJWs"" is right around the corner next.

The author- and you, presumably, since you seem so sympathetic with the viewpoint- is so, so desperately eager for any narrative that alleviates him of responsibility for horrible, bigoted opinions. It's ""assumption creep,"" it's these real-life-examples like me who are just *irrational*, who hate ""debate."" You know what it is?! It's silencing free speech- that's right! Calling someone's comments racist is silencing their right to speak freely. We'd better put a stop to people calling other peoples' comments bigoted or we'll have no free speech left!

It's a bunch of fucking whiney excuses and sobbing because people see through hedged comments like, ""I am not sure gender is entirely constructed,"" ""I'm not sure if the gender wage gap is quite as large,"" ""I'm wary of even moderate Muslims,"" and translate them to the ill-disguised bigoted views they represent.

Bigoted views are bigoted no matter how much you oppose nuclear armament.

And while we're at it by the way, that entire line of reasoning is, besides being inanely stupid, sickening in its hypocrisy. So the author is convinced that bigotry isn't really bigotry, or that it's oppression to say so. Fine. Why does that only apply to ""lefties"" like him? If he thinks accusing such a sterling ""leftie"" like himself of bigotry is wrong, then he must think that accusing a conservative right-winger of bigotry is fine, even if it's on the very same grounds.

CONTEXT: reference to an episode of a beloved polish sitcom ""Politics in Poland"". Synopsis: Popular polish conservative politician Jan-Maria Rokita is flying from Berlin with Lufthansa. While boarding, stewardess tries a sneaky Anschluss of his coat peacefully laying on an empty seat next to him. Mr. Rokita promptly realizes that this is a violation of his (and his coat's) European Human Rights. Then he proceeds to free his coat from a compartment and, in a heroic act of civic disobedience, places it on an empty seat in the business class. Stewardess is not amused. So is captain. Together, in what can be only compared to a shameful Ribbentrop-Molotov pact, they plot a devilish plan to crash polish beacon of freedom - they call airport security. As polish army in 1939, Mr. Rokita quickly falls under blitzkrieg of German might. In a last cry of freedom Mr. Rokita does what every Pole would do on his place - blames all on the Germans. Some sound co-passenger records all this on her phone. Hilarity ensues.

Aftermath: In following seasons of ""Politics in Poland"" Mr. Rokita was removed from the cast. As for the coat, it's whereabouts are still unclear.

null,false,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,null,"For those of you who don't know, Putin has gone off the radar for about a week now and no one seems to know why. Stratfor has some interesting analysis on this:

&gt;Yesterday, we had occasion to focus this diary, which is intended to be a discussion of the most significant event of the day, on China. There, an odd statement, widely circulated, caused us to wonder about the direction China's purges would take. It also caused us to feel as if we were living in the 1960s, when enigmatic wall posters were the only available hint of what was happening in China.

&gt;Today's diary must focus on Russia and resurrect the ancient art of Kremlinology to ponder whether something is going on at the top of the Russian government. Russian President Vladimir Putin was supposed to attend a Eurasian Union summit in Astana on Thursday with the presidents of Belarus and Kazakhstan. He was also supposed to attend a treaty signing with the leader of South Ossetia on Wednesday in Moscow. Both meetings were unexpectedly canceled. The news of the first cancellation came from Kazakhstan and included a statement that Putin was ill. The Russians quickly confirmed the cancellation but denied that he was sick. In fact, the presidential spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, made a point of saying there was no illness involved. The second cancellation was reported by Russian news agency Vzglad, which speculated that Putin's schedule was ""oversaturated.""

&gt;That left open the question of why the meetings were canceled. Presidents do not casually cancel summits and treaty signings. Yet he did. It was then noticed that for the last week his schedule has been surprisingly light, with meetings announced only after they happened. In the midst of rumors today, the Kremlin issued a picture of Putin meeting with the governor of Karelia.

&gt;We know three things. First, the cancellations were odd. Second, the insistence that he was not ill was also odd. Third, the Kremlin did nothing to allay concerns about Putin's status. The Russians had to know that they were not allaying concerns; denying that he was ill but giving no alternative explanation for the cancellations seemed strange as well.

&gt;When you have no idea what is going on, as we didn't, you turn your attention to anything else that was odd. The best we could do was an announcement two days ago that the Russian defense minister and the heads of the Federal Security Service and the Federal Protective Service were all in Crimea. Their presence did not seem connected to any particular event or to any known military exercise. It is not unprecedented for these three to be out of Moscow at the same time, but their presence in Crimea, a particularly sensitive area, was bound to cause speculation. Another oddity is that Konstantin Remchukov, editor-in-chief of Nezavisimaya Gazeta, a Gazprom-owned media outlet, tweeted that he was pulled aside at the Bolshoi ballet Wednesday night and told that Rosneft chief and senior Politburo member Igor Sechin would be fired tomorrow. Rosneft denied the rumor.

&gt;These oddities have no clear connection at all to Putin's cancellations, save that they were strange events not fully explained and occurring at a sensitive time, raising further questions about what exactly is going on in Moscow. One phrase from the announcement from Peskov that was particularly striking to us was that the decision to cancel the meetings was made by the ""leadership."" In the old Kremlinology style, we note that he did not say that Putin decided on the cancellations, but that the ""leadership"" had. Normally, we would pass over the phrase, except lacking other information we have to wonder whether the leadership was a reference to Putin and the Belarusian and Kazakh presidents, or whether a different leadership was making decisions about Putin's schedule instead of Putin.

&gt;After Josef Stalin died, the Soviet leadership went to the ballet. Missing was Lavrenti Beria, head of the NKVD secret police. It seemed odd that he was not there. One explanation was that Beria didn't like the ballet. This was a reasonable explanation. It was also untrue. Beria had been executed, and the purpose of the collective visit to the ballet was to showcase his exclusion from the leadership by announcing that it was caused by his exclusion from life.

&gt;In the Soviet Union, observers watched carefully for these signs to determine what was going on. The Kremlin knew that observers were doing this and used such signs to signal events that they were not yet ready to announce. When the Kremlin did not want to make things official but wanted the Soviet citizens or the West to have some idea of what was going on, an absence from an event, where an official stood while reviewing parades and the precise wording of statements took on enormous importance.

&gt;The insistence that Putin was not ill might be intended, along with other evidence, as a signal that he is quite ill. Or it might be pointing to the fact that Putin is really not ill and is canceling meetings for political reasons. The presence of the senior military and intelligence leaders in Crimea while Putin fails to make significant and scheduled appearances may have no connection, or it may have a deep connection.

&gt;We have been reduced to very old methods to try to figure out what is going on. That alone is significant. But so is the fact that these meetings were canceled. Readers may recall that we have raised the question of whether Putin could survive his failures in Ukraine and the economic shambles he faces. We are far from the only people who have raised that question. Certainly, the Kremlin is aware of the speculation, and we would expect the Kremlin to be rigorous in assuring that a normal routine of business is maintained in order to drive home the point that Putin is firmly in charge. That pattern has slipped, the Kremlin knows it has slipped, and it was content to let it slip without explanation.

&gt;**We are puzzled, when the one thing that Putin would not want is anyone to be confused about his power. If we believe he is not sick, then there must be another explanation for his absence. We should not jump to conclusions, as they are probably wrong, but we must be forgiven for being puzzled as to why Putin is letting us, and many others, be puzzled.**",null,0,null,1426166405,null,0,false,0,cpcht2a,null,t3_2yshsu,null,t1_cpcht2a,null,t3_2yshsu,null,null,null,1427718505,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

Companies like ASML, DSM, Philips, Urenco, NRG/Pallas, NXP all thrive on knowledge, not cheap labour. And the real industry (steel industry in the Eemshaven among some other things) has already gone bankrupt with the Euro. 

And the remaining industries like Shell, VDL-cars and Daf will also not see much competition that would put it out of business. Seeing as both the truck and car industry of us is the one of the most advanced in Europe, again much knowledge little low-labour. Low-labour is in Asia now anyway.

Even when you have high unemployment, it doesn't mean that companies wouldn't be functioning or generating profits. For example the large tourist sector in Greece serves mainly foreign customers. This sector still serves the same amount of customers than it did before the crisis and generates the same profits as it did before.

What you have to understand that it is not the duty of Greek companies to employee unemployed people just because of employing them. If Greek companies can increase their profits by hiring people, then they will make it. However the thing is that Greece doesn't have lot of sector that can just scale production up. First of all in agriculture and in services like tourism industry there isn't just ever increasing demand. Second thing is that Greece doesn't have much manufacturing industries that could scale up their production if there was more demand.

&gt; Also, capital flight isn't something you can just do if your money is tied up in say, a business. Warehouses don't have legs.

Warehouses still use money. That money that they use has gone from Greek banks to other Eurozone banks.

&gt;

&gt;The __Southern Alps__ is a [mountain range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_range) extending along much of the length of [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand)'s [South Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island), reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term ""Southern Alps"" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it.

&gt;The range includes the South Island's __Main Divide__, which separates the [water catchments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_basin) of the more heavily populated eastern side of the island from those on the west coast.  Politically, the Main Divide forms the boundary between the [Canterbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_Region) and [West Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Region) [Regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_New_Zealand).

You are being too harsh with this point. There are nearly 7% Polish minority and 6% Russian minority in Lithuania. There is nothing stopping a member of minority from getting enough popular support to get elected as long as he/she works for the benefit of all citizens (unlike the current situation). Also, our laws are quite decent when it comes to names - you don't have to Lithuanise them, only to write them using Lithuanian alphabet in passports and official documents (which is logical). The situation is not the most likely, but not too weird either. 


IRL, [Romanian President](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Iohannis) is an [even less likely scenario](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans_of_Romania) from an ethnic perspective.

Thirty six per cent contains a significant group with a somewhat ambivalent attitude towards Jews. This percentage comprises individuals who agree with some antisemitic statements but disagree with others and/or can or cannot say whether they agree or disagree with antisemitic statements.
A total of 59 per cent systematically rejects antisemitic prejudices.

If Greek companies can increase their profits by hiring people, then they will make it. However the thing is that Greece doesn't have lot of sector that can just scale production up. First of all in agriculture and in services like tourism industry there isn't just ever increasing demand. Second thing is that Greece doesn't have much manufacturing industries that could scale up their production if there was more demand.

100% agreed, but it's not in the current climate that manufacturing could get set up in Greece.  That will be essential in any long term solution however.

&gt;     Also, capital flight isn't something you can just do if your money is tied up in say, a business. Warehouses don't have legs.

I'm not saying I expect everyone in Croatia (Or in Split) to do things like that, but clearly some people really have some issues when it comes to anything (Perceived as) Serbian, which is what I don't understand. I simply cannot fathom how anyone can see a Serbian (Which it wasn't, but let's pretend it was..) shirt as something provocative in any way. 

&gt; You're denying there are hooligans? You left that part out. I'm going to mention

Hooligans in the football sense? No, they exist. But your part of the world is pretty darn infamous for ultras taking things to extremes we don't tend to see in most other countries. Of course there are football rivalries here and sometimes a bunch of F.C. Copenhagen fans will get into a fight with Brøndby IF fans or whatever, but they'll get banned from the stadiums, fined, potentially jailed and ""everyone"" will distance themselves from it. The club, the fanclub, the ""FA"" etc. It's not an accepted thing at all. Even if both sides essentially agree to fight.

Look up videos of Danish fans from Poland-Ukraine Euro etc. if you want to see what our fans are usually like. They're drinking, singing, partying and making a fool of themselves. There's a reason they're called 'Roligans' and not hooligans. 'Rolig' means calm in Danish. Not calm in the ""We're quiet"" sense, but in the peaceful sense. 

&gt; I guess you're thinking of this.

Well yeah, but that's not where I saw it.

While news sites and papers obviously use click bait titles on a regular basis, it eventually ""colors"" your views as well.

Even if it's in Bosnia it doesn't really change anything though. I didn't ask specifically about Croatia and Serbia. It's the regional thing I don't understand. And again, I'm not saying it's everyone in the region. The fact that's it's in Bosnia doesn't really make it any better or worse. The issue is the same. Just in another place.

&gt; Why are you focusing on crazies? This hatred among them is a lot like you can find between many other countries and races.

Because that's what I don't understand. I understand normal, friendly and sane people just fine, so why would I ask about them? While I find the crazies.. Well, crazy.. It doesn't mean understanding where they're coming from can't be interesting.

&gt; C'mon, you have some view. You obviously formed some opinions of Croatia based on a picture from reddit and few news stories covering incidents because it gets them clicks.

No, I may have some media created assumptions, but how am I to get rid of them if not by asking the people who actually live there? If anyone can destroy the false assumptions and stereotypes surely it has to be the people in the region?

It's not just the picture though. It's news, it's travel warnings, horrific pictures of someone of one nationality who's been beatedn (or worse) by people of another nationality, it's traveler stories, it's comment sections on various sites (Check a Youtube comment section on Yugo war docs for example.. Geez.)

What little place are you in ?

Unfortunately I don't know anybody who makes this service at Siena, anyway let me illustrate you where I would go.

If you ask in Siena probably the best pizza is from ""Poppi"", they give you a square pizza, but it is really good.

You can find ""Poppi"" at ""Lo stellino"" or in the city center very close to Piazza del Campo.

If you are looking for a more traditional pizza, a circle one, I would go for the pizzeria [""Antiporto""](http://www.menupizza.it/pizzeria-a-domicilio/36156/pizzeria-antiporto-snc-pizza-a-taglio-e-da-asporto-siena/) I love that pizza, even better than the Poppi one IMHO.

50+ pizzas is really a lot and it can get complicated...

I don't know what facilities you got, but if you need 50+ pizza you also need a place to host 50+ person, that place need to have an oven.

A good idea cool be to just stole a ""Pizzaiolo"" and make him make the pizza for everybody...

Otherwise you can run a ""Pizza Party"", get whoever is interesting and make pizza, then share with the rest of the group...
Please have also a plan B make pizza is not difficult but you never know what can go wrong...

Wir wissen alle das es Ungleichheit und Ungerechtigkeit auf der Welt gibt, aber da tut Deutschland auch nicht besonders viel um dem entgegen zu wirken. Das Argument für Asyl ist das wir unsere Gesellschaft mit der Anwesenheit derer bereichern die woanders verdrängt werden.

&gt; So the story of the Greek crisis is not really one of fiscal profligacy resulting in a ""sudden stop"". It is one of PRIVATE sector profligacy fuelled by rising external debt, itself resulting from (or caused by) falling competitiveness. As happened to so many countries in **2008**, the banking crisis forced private sector debts on to the public sector balance sheet.

A bit different from the narrative driven by Brussels and Berlin. I wonder why.

Visitors who stumble upon articles via a Google search are more likely to have randomly followed a link and would probably just click something else if they hit a paywall, which would mean a loss of ad revenue and a potential new subscriber (they need to come from somewhere, after all).

I'm Indian, but I'm not in any way an Indian nationalist or anything like that. I'm not trying to defend India's honor. I like to look at facts and derive conclusions from them.

That said, do you know of any statistics that show India's rape problem is significantly worse than developed countries? I have tried looking at rape statistics online, and the estimate I found (including estimate of unreported rapes) was 18 per 100,000, which is not out of line with western countries. But if you know of any better statistics or better study on the problem, I would honestly like to know about it.

Edit: Anyone want to provide some facts or statistics along with the downvotes? If I'm just a stupid, uncultured, rapist Indian, why not educate me with some facts?

null,false,jrohila,FINL,Finland,null,"&gt; 100% agreed, but it's not in the current climate that manufacturing could get set up in Greece. That will be essential in any long term solution however.

Manufacturing companies are not going to invest into Greece. Wages are too high, price of energy is too high for industrial users (0.125 EUR per kWh vs. 0.075 EUR per kWh in Finland). Greece hasn't anything to turn international companies to invest there. If they need new production it will either go to developing economies in south-east Asia or to Eastern Europe. The only reason why countries such as Finland still have some manufacturing industries left is that are specialized on high-tech and high-spec products were the R&amp;D works closely with the factory floor as an integrated unit. Another thing to note is that companies here leverage many times suppliers in China.

The only way for Greece out of this crisis is become more stable and business friendly environment. This means that it should be easier to create startups and easier for current businesses to operate. However even then it will take easily a decade to solve the aftereffects of the current crisis. Unfortunately as Greece and Greek companies are not investing into R&amp;D, it can take even more time to return to any reasonable unemployment numbers.

&gt; It shouldn't change the basis that you generate profits in Greece, you pay taxes in Greece, that said I can see the problem, and it's another one that will need a EZ wide solution (looking at you Double Dutch).

The problem in the Greek tax administration, the Greek judicial system and enforcement of court decisions.

Il faudrait se pencher sur l'activité concrète des mairies FN, mais franchement, les ""dérapages"" recensés sont assez légers ou à peu près du niveau d'une marie ordinaire : interdiction de mettre du linge aux fenêtres, installation d'un mur à l'entrée d'une rue, armement de la police municipale, remise en cause d'un local alloué gratuitement à une association, couvre-feu pour les plus jeunes... et tout un tas de dérapages purement politiques et idéologiques mais qui correspondent bien à la ligne du parti pour lequel les électeurs locaux ont voté.

Tout ça ne pèse pas dans le quotidien d'un habitant. Ce qui pèse, c'est si les trottoirs sont propres, l'entretien de la voirie communale, s'il se sent en sécurité lorsqu'il se balade, le niveau des impôts locaux, les activités auxquelles il peut participer, etc.

On en vient aux mêmes questions que pour Balkany. Tout le monde s'étonne qu'il soit réélu à chaque fois, avec un mépris à peine masqué pour ses électeurs. Mais à chaque fois que j'entends parler de lui par des ""locaux"", je n'entends que du bien pour les aspects pratiques, un intérêt très fort pour les petits problèmes locaux (que la mairie doit régler rapidement), des activités pour la population, etc. (...et un endettement record :D)",null,0,null,1426170942,null,0,false,0,cpcjz89,null,t3_2ysbnz,null,t1_cpcjz89,null,t3_2ysbnz,null,null,null,1427719588,null,19,false,france,t5_2qhjz,19,null

I don’t think colour is a bar to social cohesion. I watch the younger generation. It’s not an issue.”*

The government has [a helpful page detailing how you can do that](https://www.gov.uk/employer-preventing-discrimination/recruitment). Much as with any other law, the details of what you must do to be within its bounds are published and known in advance.

&gt; Forcing a business to hire minorities when they don't want to isn't exactly a recipe for a nice work environment.

Workplace discrimination is a similar but separate issue than hiring discrimination and there are also laws against workplace discrimination. At the end of the day, the solution can not be to accept that some employers just don't want to hire minorities; it's the employer's duty to get over their prejudice.

&gt; Good businesses don't care about race.

It's true, but not all businesses are good. The employees and prospective employess of those businesses deserve to be protected against discrimination.

I fail to see how that solves any problem.

Manipulating the exchange rate is just a fancy way to say that it's possible to dictate the empoverishment of the entire country surreptitiously, under the guise of monetary policy.

People notice who's responsible when their pay goes from 100 to 95.  

People don't notice who ordered the Central Bank to turn on the printers and forced all prices to go from 100 to 105.

Arguing in favor of an independent currency is arguing in favour of a covert mechanism to impoverish the entire nation.

But we can't ignore that the concept of 'races' is still widespread and is used as a base for discrimination. The law doesn't reinforce this concept, it actually tells people that they should ignore it when making certain important decisions.

But this isn't how anti-discrimination legislation works.

The magnitude of the Madrid bombings was too big, even for ETA. Too many civilians dead, no warning call, too close to the elections. ",null,0,null,1426173326,null,0,false,0,cpcla1i,null,t3_2ypa4n,null,t1_cpcla1i,null,t1_cpc692m,null,null,null,1427720195,null,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4,null

null,false,my_baby_ate_dingos,IDF,Ile-de-France,null,"&gt; Le cabinet de conseil que nous appellerons XYZ intervient pour le compte de multinationales, en particulier des banques. Parmi les multiples fonctions qu’ils exercent auprès de leurs clients, ses consultants assurent souvent celle de main-d’œuvre d’encadrement sur de grands projets. XYZ est en fait un cabinet de conseil « opérationnel », dont les clients sont pour la plupart des cadres dirigeants moyens (ou middle management), par opposition aux cabinets de conseil de « stratégie » (McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group et Bain &amp; Company), qui s’adressent, eux, aux directions générales.

C'est marrant, connaissant le conseil, je sais EXACTEMENT de qui ils parlent.

Alors oui, le conseil, c'est un monde à chier. Ca esseule, ça lessive, ça vide, et la chose qui fait la différence entre les bons et les mauvais, ce n'est pas la compétence, c'est la résilience. Le burn-out sert de sélection. 

Et malgré le standing que se donnent les acteurs, c'est pas du boulot intellectuel. Les boîtes de conseil vendent de la viande pour faire le sale boulot dégueu que personne chez le client ne veut faire, point. Surtout en management de changement, vu que là, l'intervention d'un *change manager* n'a qu'une utilité: celle de cristalliser les haines envers une seule personne qui est externe à l'entreprise, et ceci afin de sauvegarder les clients. C'est le *change manager* qui se fait crever les pneus de sa caisse dans le parking du client, pas le PDG. 

La distance avec le boulot, pour ma part, j'estimerais qu'elle ne vient pas de la nature du boulot de consultant en elle-même. Je pense qu'elle vient du fait qu'après des dizaines de missions, des années d'expérience, un consultant finit par voir toutes les horreurs qui peuvent se passer chez des clients, les bisbilles politiques, les croche-pattes, la connerie généralisée du client moyen qui, malgré son poste parfois très élevé, est incapable de comprendre un dixième de ce que tu lui racontes - alors que toi-même tu sais que ton boulot ne requiert pas énormément de neurones à comprendre. Ce genre d'expérience finit par créer un état d'esprit similaire à celui d'un vieux sergent, cynique et/ou amer.

&gt; Plus l’organisation du travail va à l’encontre de leurs valeurs morales personnelles, plus les salariés l’assimilent à un terrain de jeu virtuel, irréel, et appliquent strictement le comportement qui est attendu d’eux. 

Là, je suis pas d'accord. Je l'ai fait, et il est impossible de faire un boulot qui va si frontalement à l'encontre de tes valeurs morales.

If you can get in touch with another foreigner in where you want to go, make sure you ask them about the hours. 

Personally I loved Seoul way, way more than Paris. To me, and again this is only judging from my own experience and not speaking objectively, Seoul is more open-minded and more diverse as a city. There isn't a city center, but about four, so you feel you're changing environments radically from one metro station to the other. As far as food goes, it is generally less expensive to eat outside than indoors in Korea, so there is a huge culture around going out, sharing barbecues, drinking together, etc. Seoul will also make you go out more of your comfort zone (in the most ...comfortable way possible, since the city is so insanely organized and easy to live in), than Paris, people have completely different habits than in the west, and just the overall experience is more enriching in my opinion.

- the new currency will be initially unstable. The government will need to be well-advised, mature and to have nerves of steel to ensure that it stabilises without drastic levels of inflation. I am not really sure Syriza is capable of that.

- Greece will need some initial help from the international community. Ideally this would be the IMF, but I am not sure if Syriza will accept their help. There is a risk that they go to China and Russia for help and that could end up being a worry. I hope that the UK and the USA have a plan to offer interim support in case.

I am working my ass off everyday, earning 700 euros per month and I barely get by with just utility bills, rent and gas. I pay all my taxes in full. I am a prime example of the middle class of Greece at the moment believe it or not. You can hang me upside down and you'll get absolutely zero money left to give you.

Maybe in southern Spain. In the northern half of the peninsula the Reconquista started almost immediately after the Moorish invasion, and the Moors couldn't hold the land more than a couple of decades. 

The Umayyad invasion lasted from 711 to 788 and the Battle of Covadonga (the first defeat of the Muslims by Christian forces, the start of the Reconquista and the founding of the Kingdom of Asturias by the remaining Visigoths) took place in 722. The Moors were repelled from Asturias that very same year. The Kingdom of Navarre was founded around 822 and the Kingdom of Asturias evolved into Leon around 910. By 1200 [only the southern half of the Peninsula was occupied](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconquista#/media/File:Almohad1200.png).

Bear in mind that the reconquered lands were repopulated by northerners: Castilians, Asturians, Basques and Catalans basically. Catalan is spoken in Valencia today because it was repopulated by Catalans. There are Basque toponyms all around the new towns in Castile because they were repopulated by Basques.

null,false,Ballander,CROA,Croatia,null,"&gt;I'm not saying I expect everyone in Croatia (Or in Split) to do things like that, but clearly some people really have some issues when it comes to anything (Perceived as) Serbian, which is what I don't understand. I simply cannot fathom how anyone can see a Serbian (Which it wasn't, but let's pretend it was..) shirt as something provocative in any way. 

Split is a bit rough around the edges, and like I said, you can be a Croatian from Zagreb in order to get a beating there, if you run into hooligans. 
Why can they perceive it as provocative? Because they were probably drunk/drugged, which lowers their ability of rational thinking even lower.


&gt;Hooligans in the football sense? No, they exist. But your part of the world is pretty darn infamous for ultras taking things to extremes we don't tend to see in most other countries. Of course there are football rivalries here and sometimes a bunch of F.C. Copenhagen fans will get into a fight with Brøndby IF fans or whatever. 
Look up videos of Danish fans from Poland-Ukraine Euro etc. if you want to see what our fans are usually like. They're drinking, singing, partying and making a fool of themselves. There's a reason they're called 'Roligans' and not hooligans. 'Rolig' means calm in Danish. Not calm in the ""We're quiet"" sense, but in the peaceful sense. 

""My part of the world""... You're free to try any extremist thing you think you can get away with in Croatia, I assure you you won't have a nice time.


&gt;they'll get banned from the stadiums, fined, potentially jailed and ""everyone"" will distance themselves from it. The club, the fanclub, the ""FA"" etc. It's not an accepted thing at all. Even if both sides essentially agree to fight.

You think it's accepted in Croatia? Wow, I wonder what kool-aid they feed you with in Denmark.
Reading between the lines, your perception of Croatia was as it's a religous, wildwest-like warzone. Wtf?


&gt;But your part of the world is pretty darn infamous for ultras taking things to extremes we don't tend to see in most other countries.

We don't?
What about the Dutch trashing Italian works of art?
Books have been written about the UK.
This is just generalizing and sweeping your problems under the rug. The grass is not greener than in Croatia.


&gt;It's not just the picture though. It's news, it's travel warnings, horrific pictures of someone of one nationality who's been beatedn (or worse) by people of another nationality, it's traveler stories, it's comment sections on various sites 

I don't know where you're getting all this stuff from. Especially since most of it can be forged/faked (you'd be surprised how often I can come across mental gymnastics).
Tourists who come here usually thoroughly enjoy it and crime rates are rather low, Croatia is a very safe country.
Lay off the youtube and site comments, in general. 


&gt;Well yeah, but that's not where I saw it.
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/10/croatian-girl-kisses-serb_n_2839945.html

Lol, wow, I must admit I thought a tiny bit higher of Huffington Post, but this is just tabloid material at absolute worst. They base their story around a picture and reddit user, without any further looking into it and trying to have some credible sources. It's basically like you saw it on reddit.


This is worrying because who knows what crap they could run on their site if they're going to only go by the words of reddit users. 
In this case, nothing bad happened other than bolstering of some stereotypes between foreigners.


I find english articles about Croatia generally of poor quality, and often scarce and misleading.

For example, when there was the referendum about gay marriage ban, which was fairly covered, a lot of these sites were saying that 65% of Croatians voted for banning of gay marriage.

However, 65% of those who went to vote voted for banning, and only 38% of voter base went voting. But of course this gets no mention.
This can be called propaganda since it wrongfully asserts that 65% of Croatians are against gays/gay marriages, while in reality the referendum wouldn't even pass if it weren't for the stupid goverment meddling with the referendum law before the EU referendum.

I also remember reading an Economist article on Croatian elections, where they used derogatory nicknames for the candidates (which were used by common people in Croatia), which is just a huge low for a media.

Also, a lot of the articles can be very biased and filled with personal agenda rather than dealing with facts.

Croatia doesn't get reported on often, and when they do such crap job when they finally do report on it, I don't know what to say.


&gt;No, I may have some media created assumptions, but how am I to get rid of them if not by asking the people who actually live there? If anyone can destroy the false assumptions and stereotypes surely it has to be the people in the region?

Drop the 'region' and replace with 'Croatia' and I'll agree, but otherwise no. I always hated this collectivism regarding ex-Yugoslavia, since it simply cannot be under the same denominator. There's a reason it didn't work, the differences are there. Why should anyone from Serbia or Macedonia speak in my name or represent me in any way? Unfortunately, it happens too many times.


Something you may not be aware of, and that contributed to the dissolution of Yugoslavia a lot was the economic factor. Slovenia and Croatia had to give  substantial money to the underdeveloped parts of Yugoslavia (the rest of it) during the times of both Yugoslavias and this is what annoyed most people.


&gt;While I find the crazies.. Well, crazy.. It doesn't mean understanding where they're coming from can't be interesting.


They can be coming from their personal problems and frustrations.


&gt;Even if it's in Bosnia it doesn't really change anything though

It does, since I don't want to deal with stereotypes about Bosnia. The ones about Croatia are enough for me, thanks.

**Studi clinici e problemi nutrizionali**

Carenze nutrizionali

Il fruttarismo è più restrittivo del veganismo, aumentando ulteriormente la possibilità di inadeguatezza nutrizionale.[27] L'Health Promotion Program (Programma sulla Promozione della Salute) della Columbia University riporta che una dieta fruttariana può causare carenze di calcio, proteine, ferro, zinco, vitamina D, la maggior parte delle vitamine B (in particolare della B12), e acidi grassi essenziali.[28]
Vitamina B12

La vitamina B12, un prodotto batterico, non si trova in nessun frutto. Secondo il National Institutes of Health degli USA ""la fonte alimentare naturale della vitamina B12 è limitata ai cibi che provengono dagli animali.""[29] Come i crudo-vegani, che non consumano i cibi ricchi di B12, (per esempio, il latte vegetale e i cereali per la colazione), i fruttariani possono avere il bisogno di includere la B12 in maniera supplementare nella loro dieta o rischiano la carenza della vitamina B12.
Problemi relativi alla crescita e allo sviluppo

Nei bambini, la crescita e lo sviluppo sono a rischio. La posizione dei nutrizionisti è che i bambini non devono seguire la dieta fruttariana. I problemi nutrizionali includono la malnutrizione proteico-energetica, anemia e carenze di proteine, ferro, calcio, acidi grassi essenziali, fibre grezze e una vasta gamma di vitamine e minerali.[30]

E da [qui](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamina_B12_%28diete_vegetariane%29):

Durante la gravidanza e l'allattamento è particolarmente importante che la dieta delle madri vegane contenga delle fonti quotidiane e affidabili di vitamina B12 (cibi fortificati e/o integratore)[9][18][19][20], in quanto durante queste fasi della vita la B12 immagazzinata nell'organismo della donna è poco disponibile per il bambino[21][22]. La mancata assunzione di cibi fortificati e/o integratore di B12 da parte della madre durante la gravidanza e l'allattamento conduce a gravi effetti avversi sul bambino quali arresto o regressione della crescita, ipotonia, atrofia cerebrale, anemia megaloblastica, riduzione delle capacità motorie e difetti neurologici permanenti[23][24][25][26]. I bambini allattati al seno, le cui madri non abbiano un'assunzione adeguata di vitamina B12, devono dunque assumere integratori di vitamina B12[27].",null,0,null,1426176433,null,0,false,0,cpcn4s8,null,t3_2ysijs,null,t1_cpcn4s8,null,t1_cpckda0,null,null,null,1427721095,null,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3,null

Will sagen, Informationen werden in Form von elektrischen Ladungen auf einem sog. ""Floating Gate"" eines Transistors abgespeichert. Jenes ""Floating Gate"" ist nun von der Stromzufuhr durch eine Art Isolation abgeschnitten, sodass die dort gespeicherte Ladung (also die Information..) nicht einfach abfließen kann und verschwindet.
Um eine Änderung des Ladungszustands herbeizuführen müssen die Elektronen aber irgendwie diese Isolation, also den ""Nichtleiter"" passieren. Das passiert mit Hilfe des Tunneleffekts...
Das ganze wurde mehr oder weniger zufällig von Toshiba irgendwann in den 80ger Jahren entdeckt..

Not really. With a new currency and a default, Greece will have far more options to grow again. You can devalue and export your way to a recovery, like Iceland. There could be a relatively short plan (couple of years) just until the markets lend to you again. Personally I think this is your best option. Obviously, it would be even better if you could start all over without any help whatsoever from any external body or agency.

I mostly agree with your assessment.

At the beginning of the Crisis Russia, which had not yet openly committed to the war, would have been easily able to pull out if they had to expect meeting forces from Nato and thus a conflict which far escalates beyond their intention.  
At the current situation I would believe a Nato presence in western Ukraine - behind the front line and therefore not in currently disputed territory - would be able to stop Russia as being obviously aggressive against Nato forces would mean to risk a war which threatens Russias mainland. However this would freeze the conflict and depending on how heavy Nato presence is - especially if strategic assets were deployed - could mean the start of a new cold war especially given that Russia already feels threatened by Natos eastwards expansion.

I completely agree with the economic part even if Putin will for political reasons surely find himself unable to return any territory already occupied. Still it would cause Russia to faster decline as a whole.

&gt;because either EU and US are not real allays

I think this is among the key points in this conflict. Nato has no formal casus belli to get support both from its population and from international instances to start acts with the potential of causing a war against Russia. As such it is severely limited in both the actions and credible threats it can make even if from a military strategic perspective this conflict is probably the most important currently immediately going on.

Furthermore EU and USA have different motives in this conflict. The main objective off the EU is stability in its immediate surroundings as well as a good economical climate even if it means sacrificing the integrity of a formally non aligned state as long as its members are not immediately threatened^(which gives the whole thing a new dynamic given that they are increasingly vocal about feeling threatened). The prime objective of the US is to gain an ideal strategic position from with to project power against Russia. This is why the USA isn't seen as helpful or even interested in Europe in solving the current conflict. Both the US and Russia may have an interest in a frozen conflict in Ukraine.",null,0,null,1426178281,null,0,false,0,cpco9ut,null,t3_2yjk55,null,t1_cpco9ut,null,t1_cpbxnuf,null,null,null,1427721628,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

I agree with some things that have already been said: Our country is pessimistic, risk averse, fearful of progress and change, lectures others with a moral superiority that is not really backed up by our actions.
We the second oldest country by median age, and I would argue it shows.

But what I despise more than anything else is that we have somehow managed to turn pacifism from a noble virtue into a vice.
Many Germans are incredible morally lazy when it comes to war and violence. It is always bad. Always. In self-defense or in defense of the defenseless. It is wrong. It is not our way. *It is not our problem*.

So we lean back in horror whenever violence flares up, condemn all participants equally and don't engage our brains for one second. 

Pacifism for Germany is an inviolable dogma. But we have long forgotten that true pacifism is not a shield for cowards, that you can engage violence determined even (perhaps especially) as pacifist - bring sacrifices and help a good cause nonviolently. By moral support, by speaking out, by engaging, condemning, supporting those who take action. By sanctions. By sending peacekeepers. That would be respectable pacifism. But German pacifism is just for ourselfes. A safety measure and excuse for us to *not* sacrifice anything - money, moral superiority, comfort. Our german standard pacifists don't really care if the world is swallowed up by war or not, as long as they can live in peace. And don't have to hear those disquieting cries for justice.

In this case this conflict would already be frozen because Ukraine government several times showed its consent to freeze the conflict for several years. We had cease-fire 4 times including current and first two were followed only by Ukrainian side. First of them where exactly before big Ukrainian offensive that have reduce Russia-controlled region from whole Luhans'ka oblast and Donetska oblast with small part of Kharkivska oblast to approximately third of Donetska oblast and fourth part of Luhans'ka oblast. Russia already had 3 chances to freeze conflict. 

I think there must be some error in the reasoning. 

In Ukraine there is a popular discourse about intents of Russia. And one of the most popular suggestions is that Russia main goal currently is to reintegrate this regions into Ukraine with rebels and right to block work of Ukrainian government. So they first force Ukraine to bankrupt, brake with EU and US and then replace current Ukrainian government in some way. In the end of this scenario Russia may expect to get totally controlled colony with puppet government.

Aber warum glauben diese Leute denn, dass Wissenschaft funktioniert? Ich mein offensichtlich tut sie es. Wenn man die Navier-Stokes-Gleichung benutzt um Luftströme zu berechnen, dann kann man Geräte bauen die *fliegen*. Ich habe noch nie jemanden gesehen, der durch beten fliegen gelernt hat.

Die Regeln der Wissenschaft haben sich so ergeben, weil man mit ihnen Theorien entwickeln konnte, die korrekte Vorhersagen machen. Die Regeln der Wissenschaft sind nicht einfach eine gesellschaftliche Konvention; wenn du an etwas *wirklich* interessiert bist, weil die Antwort *wichtig* ist (sowas wie ""wird diese Brücke halten, wenn Autos darüber fahren"") dann *wirst* du automatisch wissenschaftliche Methoden verwenden, weil nur sie in der Lage sind eine verlässliche Antwort zu liefern.

Diese Leute die also tagsüber im Labor arbeiten und abends dann im Singkreis bei den Zeugen Jehovas sitzen, scheinen die Frage nach der Existenz von Gott nicht wichtig genug zu finden, um alle Methoden, die sie kennen, zu nutzen, um die Antwort zu finden. Aber wie kann das sein? Es ist doch wohl offensichtlich, dass ich andere Lebensentscheidungen treffe, je nachdem ob es ein Leben nach dem Tod gibt oder nicht. Wenn ich an den Koran glaube, ist Ungläubige töten die korrekte Entscheidung. Bevor ich das tue, sollte ich allerdings herausfinden, ob der Koran *wirklich* korrekt ist.

null,false,Britzer,GERM,Germany,null,"&gt; You still can't tell the difference between a creed and its adherents? Criticising islam doesn't mean hating muslims.

You are 100% positive, that all these Islamophobes around here are only worked up about the creed and not about it's adherents? There was a link here on Reddit recently about a survey in Denmark. I think more than 50% wanted to limit immigration from Muslim countries. They basically want less Muslims (the adherents!) in Denmark. That is the Islamophobia I am talking about. Wouldn't you describe 50% of the general population being racist a problem?

You see, it is difficult for people to differentiate between a religion itself, the churches, the denominations, the clergy, the congregation, cults that associate with the religion and followers of all or some of the above. Even though you don't believe that Islam is anything but a religion (or ideology), it does encompass much more than that to many people. To many Islamophobes, Islam is synonmyous with the whole Middle East, including governments and people. Even though Christians and Jews live there as well. The racist, or islamophobe is not rational. And often not well informed. They simply don't care or differentiate. Hate works that way. People are blind to subtle differences when strong emotions come into play.

&gt; Or between an inherent trait and a chosen ideology?

Most people are born into an area where there is a religion. Jews and Muslims get their penis skinned while they are babies. Who chooses to become Muslim? 

If people could change their skin color, would racism cease to exist?

Also Antiziganism is not about race, but about a specific way of life. Romani people that choose to ""integrate"" with majority society, stop moving around and settle (or are forced to settle), are not discriminated against the way Romani are. They might get racism, if their skin is dark. Just as dark skinned Muslims do. But that is not Antiziganism. So no inherent trait. You are wrong when you list Antiziganism to be about an inherent trait. It is against a culture.

&gt; Skin colour (&amp; rest of list above) doesn't come with barbaric dogma, religion does.

Some would argue that religion is the path to salvation, some say it is a barbaric dogma. Personally I think you can certainly do both. Depending on how you interpret the scripture. Jews certainly have the most bloody ones of all three. [If you care to take a look at the old testament.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt66kbYmXXk)

I certainly take issue with people that interpret any scriptures in a barbaric way and use that to justify violence. And if you interpret scriptures in a barbaric way, you are free to do that. Though I do take issue, if you use your interpretation to justify your xenophobia against Muslims. Your Islamophobia. Or that of other people. But be my guest. Interpret any text as you will. But don't expect all Muslims to do the same.

&gt; Desires of theocracy are a huge problem worldwide

Yes. But they are dwarved by other problems. Unfortunately. If we only had theocarcy to worry about, the world would be such a nice and peaceful place. Take a look here:

http://necrometrics.com/

In the 20th century the ideologies that were used to justified killing enormous amounts of people were either really evil (fascisem) or even really good (communism). It doesn't really matter, IMHO. Though when it comes to mass death, religion isn't even in the top 20, I think. You can check, if you want. In this century the most gruesome shit currently happens in and around the DRC. And yes, one of the parties invovled (the infamous Kony of the Lord's resitance army) is Christian and interprets Christianity in his own, very brutal way. But a lot of other parties manly exploit the ancient tribal or ethnic differences in the region for mass slaughter and mass rapings. Soooo.

&gt;__J002E3__ is the designation given to an object in space discovered on September 3, 2002 by amateur astronomer [Bill Yeung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kwong_Yu_Yeung). Initially thought to be an [asteroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid), it has since been tentatively identified as the [S-IVB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-IVB) third [stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket) of the [Apollo 12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_12) [Saturn V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V) rocket (designated S-IVB-507), based on [spectrographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy) evidence consistent with the paint used on the rockets.   The stage was intended to be injected into a permanent [heliocentric orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentric_orbit) in November 1969, but is now believed instead to have gone into an unstable high Earth orbit which left Earth's proximity in 1971 and again in June 2003, with an approximately 40-year cycle between heliocentric and [geocentric orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit).

2) Where and what do you mean by it rising when in the Rennaissance- should I assume you mean the Italian Renaissance? But clan and city-state were of utmost importance in that period to my knowledge.

I agree that there is a healthy dose of individualism in the liberal-capitalist reforms of the Enlightenment period, although these were far from universal. Race, nationalism, religion, socialism, and so on are all powerful forces during this period of time. Although that's certainly true of American culture too. Which I guess gets back to the problem of what is actually *meant* by saying ""individualism."" Is it a concrete philosophy in itself, or merely a facet emergent in some philosophies and less so in others?

&gt; Entire XX century was a ideological battle between the individualism and collectivism

Essentially, for the 45 years of communism, there were a lot of absurd peculiarities - like the constant shortages of toilet paper, regular shortages of meat, sugar, 20 year waiting lists for cars or flats. All of those things were grouped under an umbrella term ""in a normal country that would not happen"". Nobody knew what this normal country was supposed to be, most probably they assumed USA or western Europe. Still the idea kept strong and over the years, even after the fall of communism, every possible nuisance that bothered Polish people was added to the set of things that ""would not happen in a normal country"".


Today this all has built into this ""myth of a normal country"" - a country in which all the infrastructure is in perfect shape, but no one ever has to suffer due to this infrastructure being built or repaired; a country where all medical services are free or cheaply available, but there are no waiting lists for them and you do not have to pay any expensive medical insurance to get them; of course the country has a super effective and strong police force, that is not bound by unnecessary laws so all the criminals fear it, but this police never, ever abuses its powers; the country also has a powerful military that all the countries in the region must respect, but the upkeep of this military does not drain the country's treasury; all of this is financed through a super low taxation and the country has no budget deficits or public debt; that is possible because bureaucracy and the government are very small and have very low salaries, obviously those low salaries somehow do not contribute to the risk of corruption and despite the small number of bureaucrats every citizen's need or request is attended to immediately. And so on and so forth.


Of course, I understand the allure of utopia, but one should recognize that it is utopia. Polish people on the other hand do not think they want utopia - they think they only want to live in a normal country.

Scusa ma la prima parola che mi viene in mente leggendo quegli articoli non è ""vegano"" bensì ""fuori di testa"". Non è stata la dieta vegana ad ucciderli trattandosi di neonati a cui è stata imposta una dieta da persone che evidentemente non avevano tutte le rotelle a posto. Il mezzo attraverso cui è stato compiuto il fatto in questo caso non è rilevante. Nei casi citati non è la dieta che uccide ma l'incompetenza e la follia dei genitori.

Per riassumere: quegli articoli trattano di abuso su minori, non dieta vegana salubre o meno.

2. People have learned languages for eons without grammar. Teaching with formal grammar is a modern invention. After the invention of paper, there have been many people who have learned multiple languages armed with just a dictionary and eventually speaking to natives. That rules out grammar.

3. In the past, it has been normal for many people to know multiple languages, even from a young age, including in Europe. Most achieved this purely by speaking and immersion. That rules out rejection of multilingualism.

In other words, your thread title is provably false. 

Therefore, you are either not **motivated** nor interested enough to learn *this* language, or you have no interest in your destination (e.g. speaking with people of the German culture and language) or you actually have no interest in language learning at all at this stage in your life. There is no magic tool or app that can fix this for you.

In fact, the meaning of your statement can be turned around entirely. Arguably, it is not possible to *teach* anyone a second language. You have to go out and learn it. You could spend almost a decade being taught a language and have **exactly** the same problem: not able to form a single sentence with a native speaker. This is surprisingly common.

You have to put yourself into an uncomfortable situation, and relish the opportunity to learn. You have to commit to doing anything it takes to learn.

Se i genitori non fossero stati vegani, i bambini non sarebbero morti (per questioni legate alla malnutrizione: sarebbero potuti insorgere altri problemi, data la caratura dei genitori).

&gt; Tu non hai idea dei ciccioni che mi hanno rotto le palle perché sono vegano

Ma non ti hanno rotto le palle perchè non sei ciccione, giusto? Perchè a me (sovente, relativamente al ristretto numero di vegani vocali che conosco) i vegani rompono le palle proprio perchè non sono vegano. I tuoi ciccioni rompicoglioni hanno tentato di farti sentire in colpa per qualcosa, atteggiandosi a giudici del bene e del male e decidendo che se mangi qualcosa la tua morale è sbagliata? Perchè è questo, più spesso che no, il punto di attacco delle manfrine che fanno i vegani.

&gt; Un rincoglionito è un rincoglionito e basta, non conta cosa mangia.

Verissimo, ma se uno mi rompe le palle per un motivo specifico, è su quel motivo specifico che lo contesto.

Per essere chiaro perché non vorrei che la polemica mandasse in vacca la discussione, io non ho assolutamente nulla contro i vegetariani o i vegani: ce l'ho con chi fa proselitismo molesto. Nella mia esperienza, spesso a fare proselitismo molesto sono le persone ignoranti tipo quelle di cui si parla in questo thread.

Primaire/Collège/Lycée : 5~8 de moyenne générale chaque années, redoublement de 3e, bac au rattrapage grâce à plusieurs coups de chance.

Fac de droit : Aucune idée de ce que je comptais faire après le bac, je me suis inscris la bas par défaut. Je me suis vite rendu compte qu'il fallait beaucoup de motivation pour réussir dans ce milieu. Le droit ne m’intéressait pas vraiment. Je me suis senti complètement perdu après 2 mois, j'ai donc abandonné. J'ai tenté un redoublement et j'ai re abandonné au bout de 2 mois. je travaillais comme caissier dans un supermarché en même temps. 

BTS communication : J'ai toujours aimé la communication, mais je me suis retrouvé dans un lycée proposant la formation pour la première fois. Les profs étaient des profs du lycée dans d'autres matières et ils découvraient le programme en même temps que nous. Lycée catholique très conservateur,  l'ensemble de l'équipe administrative et pédagogique me détestaient (je les comprends, c’était réciproque), après avoir manqué mon année de peu ils ne m'ont pas laissé redoublé au sein de l'établissement.

Histoire de l'art : Décision prise cette année faute de mieux, je me suis inscrit la bas pour suivre une amie. J'aime bien l'art mais on étudie des tessons de poterie et l'architecture de vieilles églises. Pas ce à quoi je m'attendais. Je comptais profiter de cette année pour trouver quelque chose à faire. 

Je ne dis pas que l'éducation nationale c'est de la merde inutile (même si je le pense très très fort). Je considère que je ne suis simplement pas ""compatible"" avec ce système. J'aime apprendre, j'ai toujours été quelqu'un de curieux (je savais lire parfaitement au Cp car je lisais toutes sortes de bouquins imagés lorsque j’étais petit) mais l'école m'a gâché tout ça.  J'ai toujours été dans le collimateur des profs car j'ai toujours refusé de m'abaisser devant eux. Je ne vais tourner autour du pot, je déteste les profs  avec toute la haine contenue dans mes cellules. Je les détestes autant qu'Hitler détestait les juifs. Si aux infos j'entends qu'un prof à été battu/poignardé/tué par un élève, je suis content pour l'élève.

It will go surprisingly quickly. Make sure you speak aloud as much as you can in all these lessons.

As soon as you are able, start writing a sentence out on paper, physically. Try and build it to a paragraph a day about anything at all that you did. Find people to correct your writing on Lang-8.

Consider getting Anki, a nice flashcard program for PC or mobile, and putting any useful, interesting sentences or words into it.

Once you have finished the structured course, listen to Youtube videos and any other media that interests you, including simple things you already know, e.g. cartoons. Make sure they are always short. Again, do it every day.

Find short stories to read. These could be audiobooks too. Reading helps with vocabulary and structure. Fairy stories, like Grimm stories, are quite good. Or you can use childrens books. Try to read aloud at first.

Finally or simultaneously, start finding people to talk to, e.g. via contacts on Lang-8, or SharedTalk or Italki or even online activities like forums you visit or games.

Let me tell ya something mate. Things don't happen in a vacuum internationally. What is done by some nations serves as an example for other nations. For instance, even baddies like Hitler and Mussolini were genuinely afraid of an international outcry over their expansionism, so they waited until Japan carefully incurred on Manchukuo step by step to realise their own imperialism.

Likewise Putin plays a game of getting away with stuff he sees others getting away with. If the world was much harsher in condemning agressors, he wouldn't  do what he did.

I am not 'whataboutisming', think for a moment before you spew duckspeak. That's what whataboutism is. Duckspeak. Thought terminating cliche. Get out of an argument free card. I am not defending Putin, I am not saying what he does is right, I am not trying to deflect criticism. There is no whataboutism here, I am not bringing up 'US lynching Negroes' in response to a discussion of Soviet cars. Putin is a bastard guilty of all charges.

What I am saying is that international attitudes and law work solely on precedents. There is no central justice system and a policeman. The enforcement of rules is done by the community. If everyone in the community steals, it is difficult to enforce the law. If the world had a centralised and definite policeman, this would be different. Cops arrest anyone breaking the law regardless of the excuse ""she did it too"". However, in a community system it is far easier to get away with things if others do it as well.

null,false,quitesnail,earth,,null,"&gt; Nella mia esperienza, spesso a fare proselitismo molesto sono le persone ignoranti tipo quelle di cui si parla in questo thread. 

Ti do completamente ragione, quello che sto cercando di fare è spiegare che appunto la caratteristica principale di queste persone non è l'essere vegano, ma l'ignoranza. Che questa sfoci poi sul veganismo, sull'anti-vaccini, sui rapimenti alieni è solo una conseguenza, non il motivo scatenante.

È vero, forse se i genitori di quel bambino fossero stati vegani non sarebbe morto, o forse sarebbe morto di qualcos'altro, perché una persona che lascia morire di fame un infante è una persona con problemi di mente, che si sarebbero potuti manifestare in migliaia di modi differenti. Che sia stato il veganesimo è un caso. Se lo avessero ucciso a colpi di Codice di diritto privato nessuno avrebbe detto che gli avvocati fanno male alla salute. 

&gt; Perchè è questo, più spesso che no, il punto di attacco delle manfrine che fanno i vegani.

Non voglio fare il puro: anch'io piazzo pipponi alle persone. Ai miei parenti per esempio. Ai miei amici stretti. Non mi azzarderei mai a gridare assassino al tipo di fianco a me al ristorante che ordina una bistecca. Sì, penso per questioni mie che dovremmo fare a meno di mangiare animali, ma credo tante cose e non vado in giro a dirle. 

È innegabile che alcuni argomenti attirino più fanatici di altri. Non so perché il veganismo e tante cose attualissime siano pieni di fuori di testa, ma non possiamo sminuire un pensiero perché delle persone ne travisano il significato. Le persone che aggrediscono, che odiano, che per ogni foto di cane picchiato augurano morte e sofferenza non hanno capito niente del veganismo. Una corrente che spera nel rispetto e nell'uguaglianza tra esseri viventi, tra popoli diversi e non tra proprietari e posseduti non può odiare. Per queste persone il veganismo è solo una valvola di sfogo di sentimenti repressi e danneggiano quello che acclamano più di chi si nutre di animali.

Mais non, l'ONF embauche (mais ce ne sont pas les seuls, hein ! de nombreux bûcherons sont ou bossent pour un ETF, un exploitant en travaux forestiers), mais ne forment pas (à ma connaissance, je ne me suis jamais vraiment renseigné). Par contre, n'hésite pas à les contacter, je suis sûr qu'ils pourront t'aider. Surtout que t'es un cas un peu particulier.

Je pense qu'il faut plus regarder du côté des CAP/BEP. Et peut-être que pour toi, qui a eu ton bac, il y a moyen d'avoir des « équivalences », plutôt que de te retaper un programme qui s'adresse à des gosses en sortie de 3ème. Je connais une fille (enfin, une jeune femme, plutôt) qui a passé un diplôme d'ingénieur, et a finalement passé un équivalent de CAP fleuriste. Après, fleuriste, c'est pas bûcheron. Je dirai pas que c'est plus facile (si ça se trouve c'est vachement dur, j'en sais rien), mais au moins il n'y a pas de risque de tuer quelqu'un en cas d'erreur, donc des formations accélérées sont plus envisageables… J'en sais rien.

Bref, désolé de pas pouvoir plus t'aider :/

Ah, attends ! http://www.pratique.fr/comment-devenir-bucheron.html

&gt; A noter : pour les adultes, le BPA (brevet professionnel agricole) de bûcheron se prépare en 8 mois en formation continue. La spécialisation ""chef d'entreprise en travaux forestiers avec spécialité abattage"" peut permettre aux bûcherons confirmés de devenir chef d'équipe ou responsable d'exploitation forestière.

&gt; L'installation à son compte est envisageable. Il faut alors des connaissances en droit forestier.

Alors, certes, le droit forestier c'est l'enfant bâtard de droits coutumiers qui datent d'il y a 5 siècles et du Code Agricole, mais ta formation en droit ne pourra pas te faire de mal.

&gt; Pour plus d'informations, contactez l'Office national des forêts : 01 40 19 58 00

Tu pourrais peut-être voir si ça t'intéresse de travaillers dans les métiers d'art. Cf. http://www.institut-metiersdart.org/metiers-d-art.

* Tu peux essayer de voir des gens qui font un métier qui te paraît intéressant et de leur poser des questions : ""comment êtes-vous devenu X"", ""qu'est-ce qui vous plaît dans ce travail ?"".

* Tu peux essayer de trouver quelqu'un qui te prenne pour t'apprendre le métier. Ça peut être aussi bien un truc manuel que technique.

* En informatique par exemple on peut aller très loin si on est passionné, sans avoir à faire d'études supèrieures. Par contre pour progresser il faut étudier en autodidacte, lire des livres etc.

* Il y a plein de métiers très respectables où tu n'as pas besoin de faire de longues études et où tu peux bien gagner ta vie si tu te mets à ton compte et que tu fais du bon travail : plombier, électricien, agent immobilier, mécanicien... Dans le même ordre d'idées, être mécanicien en maintenance aéronautique pourrait peut-être te convenir.

Actually, the solution is that it cannot be acceptable that government statists/bureaucrats and their supports think they have some right to dictate who private individuals/organizations can(or can't) associate with and/or allow(or not allow) on *their property*, due to the fact that such ""anti-discrimination"" laws infringe upon a number of freedoms and rights(such as freedom of association, property rights, labour rights, and depending on some cases - religious freedom).

&gt;The employees and prospective employess of those businesses deserve to be protected against discrimination.

Doesn't matter what you call it, it would still require the Greek government budgeting money to such an endeavour that it doesn't currently have, and that Europe is not willing to provide. I would be completely in favor of what you proposed, European money being put to such uses like you mention instead of repaying older loans with the new ones. About bureaucracy and corruption, of course that is something they are trying to fix, I think it's some of Syriza's more prominent suggestions, but I don't think it's fair to ask the Greeks to implement infrastructure changes that other countries undertook in the course of decades and still hasn't gotten completely figured out (just look at every other European country, look at France and Italy for example, even Germany is plagued by bureaucracy), and to do it in 5 years *and* while under extreme austerity. These things take time, because they have taken time for every country that has implemented them, and they take lots of money as well. 

My point being that you can't ask and expect Greece to cut down spending on everything, but at the same time repay your loans, stimulate the economy, rebuild the infrastructure, cut the bureaucracy and the red tape, invest in industry diversification, reinvent the tax system, and when they obviously can't do those things within 5 years, point the finger and say, well, Greeks haven't done anything. Not saying that is what *yo*u said, you understand, but it is the prevalent (politically-motivated) European narrative at the moment. It's exactly what the German government and Schauble has been doing to an absurd extent - they have been very vocal about Syriza for ""losing time"" and not having fixed everything already when they've been in power for about one month.

Burning them is just another way to kill the trees and release the carbon. You're right, trees don't sit there idle: some of them grow, some of them die. In a natural state, the growth and the death balance each other out. Introducing new carbon, which has previously been underneath, to the atmosphere is what's problematic. You're also right about carbon not being magically created nor it disappearing. But we need to stop it from leaving where it's stored underground and entering the atmosphere in greater amounts. That's why we should recycle the carbon in our ecosystem (trees and atmosphere) instead of bringing more of it from outside our ecosystem (underground). Burning coal changes the carbon's location from a non-problematic place underground to a problematic place in the sky, entering the ecosystem it had previously been kept away from. No trees will appear to bind it up unless we plant them, the existing ones are already busy recycling their buddies' carbons. Now, we can take advantage of the trees' inevitable death, and have it recycled back into new trees. Leave the coal carbon in the ground, and recycle what you've already got.

Pour ""ZT"" Zone-téléchargement:

- pas d'inscription obligatoire

- Préférer les liens Uptobox - Uplea - 1fichier - Free

- le téléchargement d'un épisode de 45mn en qualité moyenne HDTV prend 10-15mn en qualité supérieure, 720p, environ 25mn.

- les liens Free sont souvent morts mais s'ils sont valides alors tu peux télécharger 6 fichiers en même temps. (besoin de confirmation de la part de ceux qui ne sont pas chez Free)

- tu peux trés bien télécharger l'épisode 01 avec Uptobox, le 02 avec Uplea, et le 03 avec 1fichier et si dispo le 04-05-06-07-08-09 avec Free

- il y a des délais entre les téléchargements sur Uptobox et 1fichier mais pas sur Uplea et Free.

- Uploaded est rarement disponible pour le téléchargement gratuit (hors Premium donc).

- Rapidgator et TurboBit sont extrêment lents. oublies.

- aide: passer le curseur de la souris sur le point d'interrogation à droite du nom de l'hébergeur du fichier

- pour chaque film, série, regarde en haut de la page, au dessus du titre, pour voir les autres versions (langue ou qualité) dispos sur le site.

- pour les séries étrangères tu auras d'abord la version VOSTFR, sous-titrée (qualité variable), puis le FR une fois dispo.

- truefrench dans le titre veut dire que l'audio est doublé par des voix FR et non  Québecquoises (VFQ).

- si tu prends un abo payant Premium chez un des hébergeurs tes téléchargements ne seront plus bridés, en vitesse comme en nombre de téléchargements simultanés. perso je n'ai jamais eu besoin de prendre du Premium donc je conseille de faire le chacal et de rester un freeloader.

About Germany's critical stance, that is a tangential discussion and not really important to what we were saying, but since we got into it: I think it's more of a series of PR moves that are supported by populist press rather than substance. On your example, for instance, about non-concrete proposals, the Greek government published an entire folder of proposals a day after the negotiations to counter the rhetoric that ""they have no numbers"", and Mr. Varoufakis later said that he was even asked to keep it deliberately vague so that it could pass in other countries' parliaments. Therefore that is an instance of criticism that holds no water whatsoever, and it's not the first one. I'm very disappointed in anyone who adopts it - including my own government at times.

&gt;Only 19 (13%) are said to improve protection standards. Many of those were tabled by Hungary, Austria, and Greece.

2011 hat er die Dokumentation ""Choosing to die"" veröffentlicht. Er begleitet in diesem Film zwei Menschen in die Schweiz, die sich für einen von Dignitas organisierten Freitod entschieden haben. Dazu schildert er seine eigenen Gedanken, seine Eindrücke und seine Zweifel bezügl. der aktiven Sterbehilfe und inwiefern diese für ihn in Frage kommt. Der Film ist wie man erwarten kann unendlich traurig, aber er ist auch anrührend und jeder dort gezeigte Mensch, Pratchett wie die Menschen, die er begleitet, trägt sich mit einer Ruhe, einer Würde und einer - so seltsam es klingt - lebensbejahenden Art, die ich nur sprachlos bewundern kann. Der Film wurde als ""Propaganda"" und ""Werbefilm"" für die aktive Sterbehilfe beschimpft, aber ich persönlich glaube, dass diese Vorwürfe von Menschen kommen, die um keinen Preis etwas positives in aktiver Sterbehilfe sehen wollen. Ich glaube den dort gezeigten Menschen, dass sie diese Entscheidung genau so empfunden und erlebt haben, wie in dem Film dargestellt.

Whether and what kinds of exemptions Iceland would get from the Common Fisheries Policy would play a major part in any future referendum on the EU. Most Icelanders want to see negotiations finalised (even if most Icelanders oppose joining the EU, as it stands), in part just to see what we would actually get. [This report, which is in Icelandic, based on interviews with EU officials, indicates that exemptions were possible](http://ams.hi.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Uttekt-AMS-um-adildarvidraedur-Islands-vid-ESB.pdf). edit: [Here's a summary in English](http://ams.hi.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IIA_EU_Iceland_Report_Executive-Summary.pdf).

One of the main reasons for joining the EU is to adopt the euro. The Icelandic currency is rubbish and the country has operated under foreign exchange controls since the crisis.

For those of you that do not know the trainstation at Harlingen Haven, it is a small Dutch city with a railway station at the harbour, close to the ferry to several islands.

The train rails are in the streets as it is only a small train to Leeuwarden, but still about 100 elephants in weight. 

We (large group of teens) just returned from the islands after a summer holiday and we had drank our last bottles of beerenburg and were quite jolly. One of us noticed that a car was parked quite close to the trainrails. But surely, the owner would know not to park too close, right

We saw the train cut around the corner, still at quite some speed, and hit the car with a loud bang. The impact launched the car towards the sea, but by some miracle, it did not dive into the harbour, but hit a dukdalf (one of those big wood poles to park a ship). The train stopped and the engineer got out to inspect the car,  fearing the worst. Fortunate, there was nobody in the car 9or what was left of it). The train had a scratch.

To our great joy, the owner of the car showed up and asked the train engineer why he could not drive around it. The engineer told him that the train had a bad day and did not feel like swerving around the car. We were quite eager to help the car owner to toss his car into the sea, but he refused. We then went chanting to the train engineer to start moving the train.

Despite high approval ratings, Putin doesn't seem to be able to accept any criticism. The freedom of opinion has been restricted, human rights activists have been branded as foreign agents and the media have been transformed into a propaganda machine. The opposition is under constant threat and even though Putin condemned the killing of Nemtzov, he still has a certain share of the responsibility, since he practically declared Nemtzov an outlaw. 

The fact that Putin's regime doesn't have a fix ideology is a problem for its long-term legitimation; it makes them borrow values known from other ideologies, such as communism and fascism. The price Russia pays for its conquests (sanctions, bad economy) will probably soon taint the mood of the little man on the streets (e.g. through social system cuts) and the satisfaction of having conquered Crimea will probably cool down as well. The oligarchs have also suffered huge losses; given that they are very important supporters of the regime, their reaction might be of importance as well. Rumour has it that some of them already wish for a more moderate head of government. 

On this backdrop, some people feel reminded of the assassination of the Sovjet politician Sergei Kirow in 1934; this event was utilised to justify large-scale political purges against internal rivals. It is more likely, though, that the assassination of Nemtzov was ordered to intimidate the opposition before they could start using Putin's political debacle for their purposes. However, there are still hardliners calling for purges - and that is very Stalinesque. Their calls are fed by the propaganda that Nemtzov was murdered by the pro-Western political forces. The nationalist Alexander Prochanow, who is one of fathers-in-mind of the intervention in Ukraine, called for the exclusion of pro-Western politicians from the government. One needs to treat every single bit of liberal ideology like a decayed tooth and annihilate it.

null,false,linklater11,null,null,null,"&gt; Remember the interwar era? That's what you get when you put an industrious country into crippling - unfair - debt. It is good the Allies learned their lesson the first time.

I agree. Allies learnt what happens when you decide to impoverish and codemn an entire nation and they gave a debt-relief AND debt payment *tied to economic growth*. Which is something understand and I agree with. The sad thing though is that they (and especially German leaders) have forgotten that now. And there are several indications that history will repeat itself unless immediate action is taken.

&gt; The problems most of us have with the Greece situation is that if we just strike out all of their debts (which essentially means paying them ourselves), chances are we got the very same situation again a decade down the road. You can't just leech off your neighbors.

""means paying them ourselves"" is exactly what has happened! The whole bail-out was a criminal scheme to bail-out the banks with the money of the European taxpayer, in direct contrast with the EU no bail-out rule! 

I agree that Greece spend more than it should, lived above their means and had massive corruption. But Germany lived *below* their means and that is at the heart of the European crisis. This was a part of a big structural imbalance of EU with Germany repeatedly violating rules with excessive primary surpluses and wage freezes/low inflation. In addition with EU commission's and ECB failure to address the obvious problems and fiscal responsibility doctrine the crisis would not be avoided. As massive deficits are not good as in Greece so are massive surpluses as in Germany! A massive surplus in the heavy-export Germany means that someone has to have a deficit! And the scary thing is in a big economy like Germany the 1% surplus is 10% of deficit in a smaller economy! To end, the Germany economy was actually the one leeching the EU creating massive deficits in the periphery by taking advantage of the common currency and free trade rules. And the sad thing is that German people have not benefited from that in the slightest..",null,0,null,1426194052,null,0,false,0,cpcyg2k,null,t3_2yt1j9,null,t1_cpcyg2k,null,t1_cpcxe2q,null,null,null,1427726419,null,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0,null

And no, people protest all the time in America, but you don't hear about them because nothing bad happens. That's the thing about America, our racial tensions are broadcasted all over the world. People across the globe now know where Ferguson, Missouri is. How many people outside of Europe know about Rotherham and the other UK rape gangs? How many know about Sweden and the apparent catastrophe in the making that's about to unfold according to the SwedenYes trolls here? How many know that Muslims (although I'm sure it has NOTHING to do with their skin color) are arrested at the same disproportionate rates in some European countries as blacks in the US? Everyone loves to point out 40% of our prison population is black, did you know 70% of France's prison population is Muslim? Although I'm positive it's because Muslims are evil and refuse to assimilate. Unlike in Amerika where it's because our cops are Klan members or something.

Giving Chechnya independence would benefit nobody in the world except the Saudi's, it certainly wouldn't end well for the residents of the region. 

It doesn't help that Russia continuously blames every violent killing/bombing on Islamic terrorists. A lot of simpletons have now begun to believe that because the Russian government lies a lot, it means the extremists don't exist at all. It's like with the US and the war on terror, people go from blindly trusting the government to thinking everything they say is categorically untrue, and the result is millions of people now think Bin Laden was a CIA asset for crying out loud. Some people only think in terms of bad vs good, and anyone against the bad is obviously good.
