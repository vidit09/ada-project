null,null,crispychoc,null,null,null,"Money varies a lot, rent for a small apartment will set you back anything from 400 - 800€/month, around 100€ for utilities on top. Food for a single person that knows how to cook and doesn't buy crap, 200 - 250€/month. I live in one of the biggest cities on the Mediterranean.

If you're going to live in a city, think about not having a car, they're expensive and paid parking is everywhere. Most major cities have great public transport.

Don't import your car, US car models are for the most part not sold in the EU, which means you need to get them through a special road worthy test and registration (called RTI), this will cost you anything from 1500 - 5000€, I've been looking to import a foreign car for a while, and it's only worth it on high end or collectors. (60s mustangs etc..). Gas prices in the EU are very high, if you decide you need a car, you'll want to buy a French econobox, which will save you money on repairs too. On top of the importation and all that, good luck trying to find a French insurance company that will insure an American model for a reasonable price... Not going to happen.

Jobs; to work in France as an American, you need a ""carte de sejour"" which is a residency permit, this needs to stipulate that you're actually allowed to work. (Not all of them do). To apply for one is similar to your famous green cards I think. If you have a skill and maybe a profession that is sought after, this process is easier. I've been through it many years ago, I can only imagine it's become a lot harder these days (mine took 6 months!). A standard tourist visa won't let you get a job. Student visas only allow you to work part time if my memory serves me right.

Getting a job as a foreigner is not easy unless you speak at least a  minimum of French. All I can think of is unskilled labour, but that won't get you the permit. Also unskilled labour is payed minimum wage, which from memory is 1200€/month for a full time job. I'm currently making a bit more, but my French is fluent, and I have a French qualification.

The good parts of living in France...

 - Universal healthcare. It's not perfect, but you won't go bankrupt just because you had an accident.

 - History and Culture, France is rich in history and arts, it's really cool just walking through streets that have been around for a thousand years. It's something I never grow tired of.

 - Food; as someone that loves food and cooking, France is awesome for that, quality of food is generally good, especially if you buy on markets.

Again, living and working in France is cool, but it's not as ""perfect"" as some people think, I came to France 20 years ago from another European country (before we had the whole free movement between EU states). France is my adopted country, there are many things I like, and a few I don't.

null,null,uayme,null,null,null,"&gt; assuming you're assertion (trade and labor market liberalization; foreign investment) is correct, these three policies positions are generally true. 

It seems to me that either you have yet to read a serious critique of these policies, or you are focused solely on the economic theory rationale, treating claim 'gdp growth leads to higher standard of living' as an axiom. Which is true as in materialism, but at least debatable in psychological and philosophical matter.

I am by no means an expert, but I'll try to outline the basics.

Firstly, you are completely right by saying that the mentioned policies are generally true, but to get a clearer picture we must ask ourselver a few question first.

In what circumstances? For whom? In what time perspective? 

So let's examine these policies, with changed order for the continuity of thought: 

&gt; Trade Liberalization

While it's true that creating a common market can improve an effectiveness and competitiveness, consider the following: while between two equally developed countries it won't generally cause major disruptions (as for example a bancrupcy of a whole industry in one country), it may be the case in a common market between more and less developed economies, especially if the gap is high. The theory says it is OK, competitive advantage allows the worse performing economy, due to relative undevelopment, to specialize itself in the less capital-demanding activities. Instead of producing, say, low quality, overpriced cars, it can produce more agricultural products, for which it will receive more and better quality cars than it would otherwise. 

Here's few problems: first is that it has no chance at start to develop its own industry. I know some says we live in a era of services, but all services are build upon industries, and it's the industry that matters most. Secondly, it does not include the costs of retraining a workforce, which can be significant, and in some cases undoable (you can't teach miner programming). Thirdly, low-capital industries generally tend to have lower gains from scale, thus making it harder to progress technologically. What leads us to:

&gt; Foreign Investment

In modern developing countries there is usually an emphasis put on the education, and the only thing that they lack is capital to make use of skills. This in combination with lower wages attracts investments, which bring capital and know how to the country and, as the theory say, if the institutional requirements are met, the developing country will catch up and converge.

What's the problem? First of all it's crucial to make a distinction of different types of FDIs - green- and brownfield investments. While brownfield may end in the transfer of know how, the plant ends as a branch of a foreign company. Due to reasons mentioned earlier it may halt country's further technological gains, thus slowing GNP growth. 

And what's wrong with greenfields? One is that, as recent crisis proved us, capital has nationality. In the times of hardship international companies tend to move its production back to country due to workers' and government pressure. Two, internationals tend to keep its R&amp;D departaments in home countries, creating mostly low paying manufacturing jobs.

&gt; Labor Market Liberalization

It's meant as an incentive to hire, but may in the end be an dead end as:
* in times of crisis given the possibility more workers will be laid of than hired and people will save more, thus decreasing demand, and lower demand means less work needed..
* less work stability increases stress and lowers quality of life, not allows for long term planning.


That's only simplified tip of the iceberg of the critique, for more you can check 'The Globalization Paradox' by Dani Rodrik, or 'Bad Samaritans' by Ha-Joon Chang.


As for protectionism, Hamilton's 'Report on Manufactures' and Friedrich List's 'national system of political economy' show just other face of government intervention, in which selected industries are protected from mainly British competition, and thus their development was possible. That Germany and USA applied protectionism to help its 'infant industries' (term coined by Alexander Hamilton) is a historical fact. The same with Japan and Korea. Because protectionism is easy to misuse, there are plenty of examples of its failures, but the same story holds: if you want to have your own industry, you must give it time to be able to stand international cometition.",null,0,null,1439074880,null,null,false,0,ctwbmnx,null,t3_3g6djg,null,null,null,t1_ctw7j2e,null,null,null,1440364669,null,1,null,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

The poor condition of German infrastructure costs Germany up to €13mil per day. Only €700mil are actually allocated for new projects, the rest is just long overdue maintenance.

&gt; The first episode opens with the mysterious suicide of a junior high school girl, Chisa Yomoda. Chisa was a classmate of Lain Iwakura, a quiet, 14-year-old junior high school girl. One of the other girls in the class has been receiving e-mail messages from Chisa, and Lain discovers she also has mail from Chisa. In the mail she explains to Lain that she just abandoned her flesh. She assures Lain that she still is alive in the 'wired' world. After getting a new 'navi' and adding a 'psyche' circuit, Lain spends more and more time in the wired. It seems that Lain has at least 2 personalities, and Lain's first personality is changing even now. Who is Lain? Who are the 'knights'? Can the wired influence the real world with a prophecy? Is the real world nothing but a hologram of the information in the wired?

Now a med sudent-turned-zombie, she takes a job in the coroner's office to gain acces to the brains she must reluctantly eat to maintain her humanity, but with each brain she consumes, she inherits the corpse's memories. With the help of her medical examiner boss and a police detective, she solves homicide cases in order to quiet the disturbing voices in her head.

No idea what you're talking about. You probably should check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawman.

&gt; The marriage serves mostly the security of women and children, it's rational and i can understand this privillage even if it's ""unequal"" and even if i think it shouldn't be granted to anybody.

And tampons are only useful for women yet men are not forbidden from buying them. /s

&gt; Britain and several other EU members also refused to sign this charter. 

Britain refused it to avoid widening strike rights, which is also bad and they should be ashamed. No other country has refused, please don't make stuff up.

&gt; What ""discrimiantion""?

We have been over this: refusing to allow them to marry, with all the legal consequences: family, adoption, pensions, inheritance, taxes...

&gt; I tell you once again that it's all about giving privillages to the other group of people, not to everybody.

And I tell you one again: that is discrimination. Should I copy paste my previous comment or can you find it yourself?

&gt; You mentioned the ""gas chambers"" for obvious reason

Yes, as a **counterexample**. 

&gt; This kind of fake martyrology is not just ridiculous 

1. There is no fake martyrology, in fact there is no martyrology of any kind.

2. What is ridiculous is basing the law of a country on a book about ghosts written 2000 years ago.

Parafrasando Albini, è più facile trasformare i videogiocatori (colti) in traduttori che i traduttori in videogiocatori.

Secondo me è infinitamente meglio lavorare da freelance, specie se vuoi guadagnare di più. Certo, facendoti assumere hai più certezze, ma se sei bravo, da freelance, non ti manca mai il lavoro. E comunque confermo, il 99% dei traduttori che conosco non è assunto.

Tatarstan can declare whatever it wants but if Moscow isn't inclined to give it independence there's little they can do about it.

null,null,IvanMedved,RUSS,Bunker,null,"&gt;You have simply talked about crimes commited by Latvian Auxiliary Police or Waffen-SS, but that doesn't say anything about the Latvian Legion and it's just a tool to derail the discussion.

The Latvian auxiliary police was not just part but composed most of the Latvian Legion before they started conscripting civilians. Even if you open [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_Legion), it says:

&gt;The initial core of the force was populated by Latvian Schutzmannschaft collaborationist auxiliary police battalions, which were formed several years earlier and had been previously engaged in anti-partisan duties. Many who had previously served in the notorious Arajs Kommando commando unit, responsible for atrocities committed against Jews, Roma, and civilians along Latvia's border with the Soviet Union were transferred to the Latvian Legion.

To this we can add order of Himmler of 24 March 1943 that explains the term of ""Latvian Legion"" and of who it was composed.

But it is not just the case of hiding between conceptions so someone can ditch crimes of the members of the Latvian Legion prior it's official creation (like the ones of Arajs Kommando). In November 1943 Riga Ghetto (or what remained of it) was massacred by the Latvian Legion.

Pray tell, what percentage of the Legion consisted of auxiliary police.

Ihr könnt von mir aus soviel helfen wie ihr wollt, nur zahlt das gefälligst aus eigener Tasche.

&gt;Die Mittel sind nicht erschöpft oder wurde einem Hartz IV Empfänger die Mittel wegen der Flüchtlinge gekürzt?

Es wird an der Wartung und Erhaltung öffentlicher Einrichtungen gespart, Steuern werden erhöht, das Sozialsystem ist am Rand des Zusammenbruchs, Gebäude werden beschlagnahmt und so weiter. Die Frage wie man alles bezahlen soll ist derzeit *das* Thema in der Politik.

&gt;Wie kannst du mit Menschen, die vor Hunger, Armut, Verfolgung, Tod, Krieg und Folter fliehen, kein Mitgefühl haben? 

Jahrelange Übung.

Ernsthaft, der halben Welt gehts scheiße. Was ist an denen so besonderes, nur weil sie illegal über die Grenze kommen?

&gt;Deutschland, als eines der reichsten Länder der Welt, ist durchaus in der Lage 2 oder 3 Milliarden in die Hand zu nehmen und könnte die unmenschlichen Zustände in den Lagern zügig abzuschaffen. 

Guter Witz.

Deutschland hat über 2 billionen Euro Schulden (wobei so gut wie abgeschriebenes Geld von der Griechenlandtragödie nicht inbegriffen ist), millionen von Arbeitslosen, Wirtschaft im Abwind und einiges mehr.

Wir sind noch am kreditwürdigsten, aber das wars auch schon. Oder würdest du jemanden, der nur Geld hat wenn er einen Kredit nach dem anderen aufnimmt als reich bezeichnen?

&gt;Von den ganzen leerstehenden Wohnblöcken in Sachsen mal ganz zu schweigen.

Du meinst die verrottenden, seit Jahren unbewohnten und aktuell großteils unbewohnbaren Betonklötze aus DDR Zeiten? Die müssten erst grundlegend saniert und modernisiert werden, bevor da irgendwer menschenwürdig drin leben kann. Und das würde *richtig* teuer werden. Was meinst du, warum die Dinger reihenweise abgerissen werden?

&gt;Die Bevölkerung zeigt sich an vielen Orten äußerst hilfsbereit.

Und zwar so hilfsbereit, dass die Heime keine Spenden mehr wollen, weil man bereits in Altkleidern und überflüssigem Kinderspielzeug erstickt. Supi.

Wenn sie anfangen Wohnraum und Verpflegung auf eigene Kosten zur Verfügung zu stellen, dann kannst du die gerne als Argument vorbringen.

&gt;Also alle ablehnen und wieder zurück schicken in ihr Elend?

In Anbetracht der Tatsache, dass der Bruchteil eines Bruchteiles tatsächlich asylberechtigt ist und etwa ein drittel aus humanitären Gründen geduldet wird: ja.

Wir können nicht jeden aufnehmen, der nach westlichen Standards arm ist. Das ist auch rechtlich nicht vorgesehen. Tatsächlich blockieren diese Fälle Plätze für Menschen, bei denen es tatsächlich um Leben und Tod geht.

&gt;Oder gleich im Mittelmeer versenken?

Das übernehmen die ja regelmäßig selbst. Entweder aus Dummheit (bspw. Lagerfeuer auf dem deck eines Holzbootes entfachen) oder weil man seine ""Rettung"" durch die bereits vorher gerufene Küstenwache erzwingen will.

&gt;Genau gegen Leute wie dich müssen wir alle aufstehen und den Mund aufmachen.

Du meinst Leute die täglich malochen und die Hälfte des Lohnes an den Staat abgeben? Die ein Problem damit haben, dass besagte Hälfte an Menschen verschenkt wird, die illegal über die Grenze kommen, vorsätzlich das Sozialsystem ausnutzen und mittlerweile mit Bargeld (welches ebenfalls aus Steuermitteln stammt) bestochen werden damit sie wieder gehen anstatt es wie vorgesehen in Bildung, Infrastruktur und andere Dinge zu stecken, die dem Wohl des Steuerzahlers dienen?

Sorry, aber ich hab mir schon zu oft von Sozialfällen und Leuten, denen alles von Papa finanziert wird anhören dürfen, dass wir ja soooo reich seien und diesen Reichtum teilen müssen. Von Leuten, die 40 Stunden die Woche und mehr arbeiten müssen um gerademal so über die Runden zu kommen hört man sowas so gut wie nie.

&gt;Du verbreitest Haß und versuchst Leidende gegen Leidende auszuspielen.

Unangenehme Fakten auszusprechen und die Umsetzung geltenden Rechtes zu fordern ist jetzt also equivalent zum ""Hass verbreiten"". Erinnert mich ein bisschen an Moslems, die anderen Hate Speech vorwerfen weil sie aus dem koran zitieren.

Und davon abgesehen, dass ich niemanden auszuspielen brauche, wäre das auch überhaupt nicht möglich, wenn die Machthaber ihrem Eid dem Wohle des deutschen Volkes zu dienen und Schaden von ihm abzuwenden nachkämen.

Dann würde man nämlich geltendes Recht umsetzen, anstatt die Bürger ständig vor vollendete Tatsachen zu stellen, sie dafür auch noch zahlen zu lassen und damit eine immer angespanntere Situation herbeizuführen.",null,1,null,1439077991,null,null,1439079712,0,ctwd66v,null,t3_3g893v,null,null,null,t1_ctvzymx,null,null,null,1440365395,null,0,null,de,t5_22i0,0,null

&gt;Seit vergangenen Oktober sind in Cizre acht Jugendliche von Sicherheitskräften getötet worden, bei Solidaritätskundgebungen für die syrische Grenzstadt Kobane vor ein paar Monaten, einfach so. Die Polizei behauptete jedes Mal, es habe sich um Terroristen gehandelt, um Mitglieder von YDG-H oder YPG.

&gt;Wie im Fall von Hasan Nerse, einem 17-jährigen Schüler. Er war vergangenen Mittwoch zu später Stunde mit drei Freunden unterwegs. Sie fuhren mit dem Auto, als Polizisten sie in der Stadt stoppten und zum Aussteigen auffordern. Die Freunde liefen weg, Hasan blieb stehen. Trotzdem eröffneten die Polizisten das Feuer und trafen ihn in beide Knie. Hasan fiel zu Boden, schrie vor Schmerzen. Die Polizisten legten ihm Handschellen an und fesselten seine Füße.
""Bist du Kurde oder Türke?"", brüllte ihn ein Polizist an. ""Kurde"", antwortete Hasan. Der Polizist zückte seine Pistole und drückte ab. Eine Kugel traf Hasan in die Brust. Er verblutete.

&gt;Zumindest die Tötung lässt sich überprüfen. Mehrere Augenzeugen haben die Schüsse gefilmt und fotografiert. Die Bilder belegen, dass die Polizei einen in diesem Moment wehrlosen Jungen erschossen hat.

They drove by car when police stopped them in the city and ask to get off. The friends ran away, Hasan stopped. Nevertheless, the police opened fire and hit him in both knees. Hasan fell to the ground, screaming in pain. The policemen put handcuffs on him and tied his feet.
""Are you a Kurd or Turk?"" A policeman shouted at him. ""Kurd"" Hasan replied. The policeman pulled out his gun and fired. A bullet struck Hasan in the chest. He bled to death.

The talk that was given was:
""Some people have not fully decided a religon, they might get into heaven too if they are good people. Napoleon was a humanist, and he might not have been too bad I suppose"".

This was the total discussion on secularism a 2 year seinor high school religon class. Other interesting topics included how porn was bad and serial killers looked at it.. How living in sin was wrong ect..

I recall even recall one teacher even saying that some of the victims of the stardust nightclub fire in the 1980s were fortunate because they could have went home and sinned that night... and not made it into heaven.

It's making me sad, it feels like whole country gone crazy. Far right (PiS, KORWiN, Kukiz) is claiming that current party (center-right, PO) left country in ruins (we have better economical situation than ever), that we have to totally outlaw abortion, gays and transsexuals don't deserve any rights, in vitro should be outlawed etc. and most people are buying that. Of course that means there is no way that we will legalize gay marriages or civil unions in next 5 years.
Also right-wing parties (and people) are on war with mainstream centrist media (Wyborcza, TVN), claiming that they spread lies. PiS says they are going to ""fix"" the media when they get to power.

Recently Kukiz guy appeared, an ex-rockstar, now right-winged politican who claims that the only way to avoid two-party system is to introduce single-member voting districts (and that's his whole program). ~60% of poles believe him in this matter and we're going to have referendum about changing voting system.

Fun fact: polish youth is much more conservative, xenophobic and homophobic than middle-aged people and they usually vote for right-winged populists (like Korwin, Kowalski, Kukiz and even Kaczyński).

« M. Labrune

Je vous communique aujourd’hui que je ne continuerai pas à être l’entraineur de l’Olympique de Marseille. Je voudrais vous expliquer les motifs de mon départ. Je rends publique cette lettre parce que je considère qu’il est nécessaire d’expliquer ma position. Si vous voulez que nous donnions une conférence de presse, je peux l’accompagner.

Après une série de rencontres qui se sont passées lors des mois de mai, juin et juillet, nous avons réussi à trouver un accord sur les termes d’une prolongation pour les saisons 2015-2016 et 2016-2017 du contrat qui s’était terminé le 1er juillet 2015. (…) Depuis mi-juillet, même si tout n’avait pas été officiel, tous les membres du staff que je conduis, nous travaillions en pensant que tout était clair et qu’il ne manquait plus que la réception des contrats imprimés.

Mercredi dernier, j’ai été convoqué par le directeur général du club Philippe Pérez à une réunion à laquelle a également participé l’avocat Igor Levin, représentant de Margarita Louis-Dreyfus. Ils m’ont informé qu’ils voulaient changer quelques points de l’accord que nous avions déjà trouvé. Tous les deux ont dit qu’ils avaient le pouvoir pour assumer ces positions. J’ai pris en compte tous les changements qu’ils voulaient mettre dans le contrat.

Après cette réunion, j’ai pris la décision que je suis en train de vous donner. Même si je pense que vous ne le vouliez pas, ce qu’il s’est passé fait partie de votre domaine d’autorité. Je ne sais si vous avez consenti ou si vous l’ignoriez. Comme vous le savez, j’ai refusé plusieurs offres importantes parce que je voulais rester à Marseille. Je ne regrette pas d’avoir fait ce que j’ai fait parce car je l’ai fait avec beaucoup d’enthousiasme. J’étais très attiré par ce projet. Je me suis adapté ces derniers temps aux variations constantes du projet sportif mais après trois mois de discussion et à deux jours du début de la compétition officielle, je ne peux pas accepter la situation d’instabilité qu’ils ont provoquée en voulant changer les termes du contrat. 
Ma position est donc de ne pas continuer à travailler avec vous. Elle est définitive. Le travail en commun exige un minimum de confiance que nous n’avons plus. Je ne voulais pas toucher la préparation du match contre Caen, voilà pourquoi j’ai attendu avec de parler de cette lettre (…). Je vous remercie d’avoir pensé à moi pour diriger l’Olympique de Marseille. J’ai travaillé avec de grands footballeurs. J’ai pu profiter du Vélodrome et don incroyable public. Je vous salue.

null,null,ParanoidMoron,null,null,null,"&gt;Latvian Auxiliary Police became core of the legion.

From your own quote - ""The initial core of the force was populated by Latvian Schutzmannschaft collaborationist auxiliary police battalions""

You do understand what ""initial"" means? 

&gt;I just told you, above, by order of Himmler of 24 March 1943 the Latvian Auxiliary Police and Arajs Kommando became part and core of the Legion. 

I again have to contest your claims of those two groups being the core of the legion throughout the whole existence of the legion. You yourself stated it was the core of the organization BEFORE they started conscripting civilians. Meaning, it later ceased to be the core of the legion.   

&gt;And the massacre of Riga Ghetto happened after that, same year.

[Most of the Latvian Jews \(about 24,000\) were killed on November 30 and December 8, 1941 in the Rumbula massacre.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riga_Ghetto)

Here's the time-line after 24 March 1943, when the legion was created. 

&gt;July 1943: Transfer of ghetto occupants to Kaiserwald (Mežaparks) concentration camp begins.

&gt;8 Oct 1943: Transfer of Liepāja Ghetto survivors to Riga Ghetto

&gt;2 Nov 1943: About 2,000 people, including children, their caregivers, the old and the sick, are transported from the ghetto to Auschwitz concentration camp.

&gt;End of Nov 1943: All Jews removed from the ghetto, either by transport to another camp or by murder.

There's no mention of the amount of Jews killed in this time-frame. That said, the wikipedia entry might have specified the amount of Jews who were killed.

I'd also like to add that conscription started a month after the order was given out - 

&gt;One month after the unit was founded, German occupation authorities in Latvia started conscripting military age men. 

Meaning, the initial core of the Latvian Legion, up until April 24, was made up Arajs Kommando and the Auxiliary Police. That gives us half a year between the majority of Latvian Legion consisting of conscripts and the date October 1943 - when the Ghetto was devoid of prisoners. Taking all of the above into account, how did you come to a conclusion that Latvian Legion in its entirety is responsible for what happened in Riga's Ghetto, that is unless their are guilty simply due to association?

I showed you absurdness of citing ancient maps.

&gt;Nope, they had stable control over the part of the territory. Although South Ossetia had declared independence before Georgia, this happened before the dissolution of the Soviet Union and even Moscow didn't recognize such secession. This is irrelevant since even Russia itself recognized Georgia in 1992 including both Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

Again that was my response to you pulling historical maps. And since 1992 US set a precedent in Kosovo. Georgia just picked a wrong time to sucking up to US as well as wrong means to achieve its goal when it knew for a fact Russia would stop them.

&gt;So let's just assume that Tatarstan declares independence. Would you support this?

If they could pull it off without outside interference, sure.

&gt;So where was Russia when the Philippine Army reintegrated Bangsamoro Republik into the Phillipines? Where is Russia now when Syria and Iraq try to reintegrate the Islamic State?

Its on Russia to decide on when to intervene. And they are supporting Syria with arms atm.

&gt;Would Saudi Arabia be justified for its invasion of Russia during the Chechen War?

The word ""justified"" doesnt exist in international politics. Its completely meaningless. And it would be Russia that should have attacked SA in response. Chechnia was a region under de jure and de facto Russian control when shit happened. Ossetia and Abkhazia were neither and were under peacekeepers protection (under UN directive).

&gt;What makes you think that I've not read the report? Those shellings you mention were minor. However in early August South Ossetia broke the ceasefire agreements and started shelling the Georgian civilians with 122 mm shells. This was acknowledged even by the Russian peacekeepers.

Had you read the report you'd know that shit started when Shakashvili came to power. Also ceasefire was unilateral and if you ask me it was a diversion. You dont move entire army to position for attack and then actually attack under ceasefire you just declared.

&gt;So the Russian peacekeper was lying?

Probably not. Still responding with multiple grad's on a city is a crime in itself.

&gt;It seems that everything that contradicts the Kremlin's narrative is propaganda for you?

Anything that aims at emotions instead of reason is shit not worth my time. The video starts with freaking ""lobotomy"" to explain people it sees as affected by Russian propaganda.

&gt;I will cite the source published in 2014: https://books.google.com/books/about/Putin_s_Wars.html?id=10XUngEACAAJ[5]

The very title ""Putins wars"" doesnt ring any bullshit detector to you? 

&gt;Possibly Americans forbade him to publicly announce about the Russian invasion.

Really? That would actually give him legitimate reason to attack. And you are saying that instead he shoots himself in the foot and proclaim ""restoration of constitutional power""? Ironic, considering Georgia never had constitutional power over it to begin with. At least not de facto/jure.

&gt;I'll do. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8281990.stm[6]

EU countries said in a statement the report was **not about apportioning blame**, but they hoped it could ""contribute toward a better understanding of the origins and the course of last year's conflict"".

This is why they ""distanced themselves"" from it. The article also states: ""The conflict erupted on 7 August 2008, as Georgia shelled the breakaway region of South Ossetia, **in an attempt to regain control over it**.""

Just as Shakashvili promised and general said when attack started.

&gt;And this sums up the very recent EU position: ""whereas the reaction of the EU to Russia’s aggression towards, and violation of the territorial integrity of Georgia in 2008 may have encouraged Russia to act in a similar way in Ukraine;"" http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+REPORT+A8-2015-0171+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN

You are quoting a motion for resolution. In a time when EU is effectively in direct opposition to Russia. Im surprised they arent stating that Putin eats babies.

&gt;Since 2009, many new reports and researches have been published that undermine the EU investigation. This was for example published in 2012: ""It seems clear that Russia had been preparing for this war for years, and deliberately provoked Georgia through the shooting and shelling of Georgian-controlled villages in South Ossetia.""

Really? From blatant Russian aggression to getting provoked and now to preemptive strike. Ill stick to EU report, and i quote your own source: *""It was commissioned by the Council of the European Union, and written by Swiss diplomat Heidi Tagliavini, with the help of 30 European military, legal and history experts.""*. And this report was written after relations with Russia were somewhat normalised.

&gt;I'm Russian myself and I'll always recognize the typical Russian arguments. You argue just like the majority of ordinary Russians. I've studied the history of the region. I don't think that Russia needs South Ossetia and we should be involved in the internal affairs of Georgia.

You might wanna scratch that ""always"". Im Slovenian.

And believe it or not, all my arguments come from western sources and their contradictions. If i see an absurd statement i ask for more evidence, If i see contradiction i discard source as unreliable, if i see pandering to emotions and demonising of one side i disregard it as a source as well. 

Major wake up call for me was BBC report on the conflict. First they reported live about it as a Georgian military operation to restore authority over Ossetia. Zero mention of Russians. The moment Russia got involved they did a 180° turn and presented it as blatant Russian aggression. Since then i have same standard for western media as for N. Korean media (when it comes to Russia).

&gt;What victim complex are you talking about? As I have said, I'm myself Russian and I am ashamed of the current Russian leadership. EU investigation is now outdated since many new researches have been published, which blame Putin and Russia's policy. But you of course won't believe them.

You were whining about ""Georgia had no right to send a single shell into the city [of Tskhinvali]. "". Its simplified out of context approach to justify your reasoning. Reality is much more complex.

I dont approve of certain stuff Putin does in Russia, but in Georgia (and Ukraine) i would do much much more in his place (i consider west directly and indirectly responsible for those conflicts simply because i see their actions as continuation of wolfowitz doctrine). If you think west has Russias well being in mind when its meddling in those areas then you are delusional. I see their actions extremely destabilizing and as attempt to push Russia into a corner where it can dictate its demands to it.

But why we should share the remembrance day? Why? What's the reason for that and what's the outcome?

One clip *officially backed up by the BBC*. So if you view that clip as biased, then it proves the BBC is biased against the yes campaign. The 'it's only one clip' argument only holds up if the clip isn't scrutinised.

&gt;And one that the BBC already clarified though you dismissed that in your first post. 

What do you mean by this? Them clarifying it as not biased strenghtens my point, as it clearly is.

China was heavily fractured not on ethnicity, but on regions within its very recent past, and it's not impossible that problems within China could cause greater schisms like happened repeatedly in the previous century. Ignoring that and focusing on the two mostly irrelevant ethnic majority provinces is ignoring the realities of China. Yes, it's unlikely to think that China will break apart over ethnic groups. However, it's needlessly dismissive to ignore that China has bigger regional schisms that are totally unrelated to ethnicity.

Gebraucht kannst du Bettrahmen und Lattenrost oft recht günstig bekommen (kleinanzeigen, ebay). Matratze würde ich persönlich **nie** gebraucht kaufen, ist wie gebrauchte Unterhosen kaufen...

Wenn du neu kaufen willst geht auf der Preisskala viel. Bettrahmen bei Ikea können sehr günstig sein oder auch sehr teuer. Kannst natürlich auch Rahmen aus Naturholz oder aus Gold kaufen. Ich persönlich bin Fan von sehr simplen Bettrahmen, muss im Prinzip ja nur das Lattenrost halten. Interessant wäre zB zu gucken, dass das Bett eine angenehme Höhe hat und ob du einen Bettkasten darunter nutzen möchtest... Aber insbesondere beim Rahmen kommst du auch mit sehr günstigen davon ohne am Schlafkomfort Abstriche machen zu müssen. Ich persönlich habe ein Bett von [rs-Möbel](http://www.rs-moebel.de/cms/)

Lattenrost und Matratze sollten in der Regel passend zusammen gekauft werden und vor allem auf dein Körpergewicht abgestimmt sein. Wenn du genug Geld hast, lohnt es sich zum Fachhändler zu gehen und dich eingehend beraten zu lassen

Immerhin verbringst du ca. 1/3 deines Lebens im Bett, dann darf das auch ruhig mal einen Monatslohn kosten.

Lattenroste gibt es aber auch günstig, wenn man sie nicht einstellen braucht, jedoch rächt es sich auf lange Sicht wenn du nie beraten wurdest.

Matratzen gibt es auch hin und wieder bei Aldi günstig zu kaufen. Am besten solltest du dir einen Stiftung Warentest Bericht dazu besorgen. Es gibt zig verschiedene Dinge bei Matratzen zu beachten. Ob es Sommer- und Winterseite gibt, das Material, die verschiedenen Schichten. Hier gibt es viel Augenwischerei aber auch manche Vor- und Nachteile. Die Stiftung Warentest klärt da in der Regel sehr gut auf.

Betten sind eines der Dinge in welche die Deutschen in der Regel zu wenig investieren. Rücken- Kreuz- und Schulterschmerzen sind da oft vorprogrammiert. Auch ein passendes Kopfkissen nicht vergessen!

Any health screen has some rate of false positives. Which is why there are none suggested for everyone and only a small list for everyone over 30 etc. There's a cost/benefit public health analysis that has to be done. A fantastic screening * millions of people == thousands of false positives.

The costs are the false positives or unnecessary procedures (like treating a cancer that never would've been a problem). The benefit is identifying illnesses early enough that they can be treated. So it matters just as much what the treatments are as how good the screening is.

 * to refrain from economic coercion designed to subordinate to their own interest the exercise by Ukraine of the rights inherent in its sovereignty and thus to secure advantages of any kind

 * to seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine, as a non-nuclear-weapon State party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, if Ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used

 * not to use nuclear weapons against any non-nuclearweapon State party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, except in the case of an attack on themselves, their territories or dependent territories, their armed forces, or their allies, by such a State in association or alliance with a nuclear-weapon State

Where to begin with this.

What does this even mean? 

&gt;...in order to be able to copy the code of the tax system's website onto a large computer in his office

So he is telling us that an elaborate system of this nature can run from just one desktop/laptop? The database, the web server and all other calculating units that do the actual math?


&gt;... how to design and implement this parallel payment system

Who was working on this design and for how long? Who was responsible for what part? Don't get me started on legacy issues with software which are a complete nightmare.



For the record, I worked in an Exchange in NYC. Upgrading anything software wise on the trading units was always a process that took few months. Reason being is simply because any logical error would cost millions and possibly billions of dollars.

You know about Knight's financial disaster and how a logical error cost them 300 million dollars within 15 minutes? Read on it. An error in their algo caused this.

Says the guy whose last comment was literally just insults and a four word restatement of your point. 

I have a clear argument, the BBC is subtly biased in many ways, due to its demographics, and this was evident during the Scottish referendum. Your comments, however, have pretty much just been a combination of ""you're wrong"", peppered with an increasing amounts of insults as you get more frustrated. The only thing resembling an argument was 'they'd lose revenue' which you then dropped immediately when I pointed out that wouldn't even happen.


&gt;Where did this come from

&gt; Your ass maybe?

Just because you can't figure it out doesn't mean it's bullshit.

4% is the rough percentage of the UK that voted yes. Scotland is a bit less than 8% of the UK, slightly less than half voted yes. The 2.5% of revenue for that 4% comes from the fact that about 70% of the BBC's revenue is from the license fee, and I rounded down because the 8% and 4% were rounded up. I figured Scottish nationalists in England, Wales, and NI were insignificant enough to be ignored.

And that's optimistically assuming the BBC matches the demographics of the UK, when in reality it'll probably be slanted towards more English people, and definitely slanted towards more well-off people, pushing the amount of Scottish nationalists even lower.

C'est une sorte de pied de nez qui a été réalisé par Canal+ et notamment Hazanavicius à la Warner dont ils avaient eu les droits d'exploiter le catalogue dans des conditions très vague. Ils ont donc repris plusieurs films qu'ils ont remonté pour faire une parodie de Citizen Kane, en s'adjoignant les voix des doubleurs français officiels des différents acteurs.

La Warner n'avait que moyennement apprécié, et depuis que les droits ont été perdu par Canal, le flim ne peut plus être exploité commercialement, que cela soit à la télévision ou en support physique. Il faut voir cela comme une grosse blague potage dans l'esprit Canal de l'époque.

Après, l'humour reste quelque chose de très subjectif. Le film sans être drôle en soi dispose de nombreuses références qui sont partagées par une génération. C'est comme la cité de la peur ou les trois frères. Certains vont le trouver drôle tout particulièrement parcequ'à une époque, nous l'avons tous vu et que nous en répétions les tirades en permanence. Je pense par exemple à la série HotShot, qui sans les codes liés à Top Gun et Rambo et un certains nombres de films et actualités de l'époque (Vietnam et première guerre du golfe) ne sont probablement pas aussi drôles.

J'imagine que chaque génération a des sortes de films cultes qui ne le sont plus que par un aspect générationel que par le film en lui même.

Russia never said it will support Armenia if Azerbaijan tries to invade Karabakh. Russia has a military contracts only with Armenia. If Azerbaijan or Turkey try to attack the actual Armenian territories, then Russia will intervene. Armenia-Russia military contracts do not include Karabakh.

Still, Azerbaijan can not attack and invade Karabakh, even if their budget is 10 times bigger. Even if their military spending is 10 times bigger. They can't win because they spend tons of money on offensive equipment that will be destroyed by a much cheaper Armenian defense equipment, who hold a much better strategic positions. The money plays a little role in this case. Azerbaijan could possibly win if the war lasted for a decade, but it's even harder today because of the oil price issues and obligations towards international bodies who invested $50 billion to do oil business in Azerbaijan. No one is going to be happy about it, and the dear leader will be overthrown.

Thus the problem can only be solved peacefully. This means Azerbaijan must recognize the NKR independence, NKR must return the 7 occupied Azeri territories and Azerbaijan must return the 2 occupied NKR territories. No refugees can be relocated because last time I checked, Azeris were killing Armenians with an ax and fire and receiving a national hero status. So I guess you can thank Ilham Aliyev and previous leaders for making it impossible for the poor people to return to their old homes.

The peace process is only possible if NKR and Azerbaijan have a dialogue. Illham Aliyev doesn't want that, so basically Azerbaijan is refusing the peace talks. It's also refusing to start a war. This means Azerbaijan likes the current status...? Not really. Ilham Aliyev likes the current status, but Azerbaijan doesn't. Thus Ilham Aliyev is Azerbaijan's #1 enemy at the moment.

I just studied abroad in Italy (Florence) and made use of all the modes of transport. :) Hopefully I can help! 


So as rd973 stated, Cinque Terre and Genoa are right next to each other. It's definitely closer than the two 1/2 hour train ride from Florence (Firenze) to Cinque Terre. They were also right about Firenze, Rome (Roma), and Venice (Venezia) being connected by high-speed trains. 


I'd suggest driving from the closet airport to Lake Como to Genoa. From there you can take the train to Cinque Terre. After that you'd probably want to take the train from Cinque Terre to Firenze. From there you could go to Bologna (on the way to Venezia) and then to Venezia. :) Then I'd suggest taking the train to Roma; it is the longest, I believe high-speed train is 4 hours. 


For the car and what-not, I'd just look around. I'm sure you can get a car from a larger airport. The individual cities seem to have their own car services too. 


XD Your itinerary isn't that bad, don't worry. It's totally possible! Although, depending on how much time you have, you may not get the full experience of some places. For Cinque Terre (I have to say it's amazing, I'm sad to have only spent three days there) I'd suggest going to all five cities. Each of them have their own unique feel. (I think the best ones are Riomaggiore, Manarola, and Corniglia). 


If you want any suggestions or input about Venezia, Firenze, Cinque Terre, and Roma I'd be more than happy to give them. :)

- Definitely better, as another comment said, to visit Cinque Terre while you are in Genoa, it is very close. The train service is good.

- Yes there are tolls on the highways, they are not crazy high but they can impact your budget. http://www.viamichelin.com/ allows you to calculate the cost of your car trip with fuel and tolls.

- BlaBlaCar should work, I know some people that use it, but it's not widespread enough to rely 100% on it without a plan B. You might not find anyone driving the route you want, in the date and time you need. Personally I like to have everything thoroughly planned when I travel, so I wouldn't bother to try it just to spare the car rental money when you have already committed to a thousands-of-dollars intercontinental flight.

- How long are you staying? If you are staying 10 days or more, yours looks like a good plan. If you are staying 1 week, in my opinion that's too much stuff and you would spend too much time travelling and way too little time in the actual cities, seeing and doing things. In that case I would skip Genoa and Lake Como.

- How come are you starting the trip from Genoa? Where are you landing?

It also said that some countries like Germany import honey from countries where GM crops are used a lot, such as Canada and China. But it does not say that it is then labeled as ""made in Germany"". And I'm pretty sure that is also illegal.

This makes it seem like all German honey is just imported from China. And that's not the case. A lot of the honey sold in Germany is locally made, some is imported from other places in Europe and some comes from outside of Europe. But ""German honey"" is honey that's made in Germany.

Several news that I would qualify as 'weird' this week. They are mostly tragic:

- **Around 20 kids - aged 5 (!) to 13 - trashed a  kindergarden.**

([Source](http://www.thelocal.fr/20150803/children-trash-french-kindergarten)). (Took place around 7pm in case you were wondering).

- **4 minors dead and 10 injured in a car crash... In one car: they were coming back from a party and all 14 of them boarded a Citroën Berlingo.** (Supposed to accomodate 7 people). The driver was 17. (It was his dad's car, who was absent). 

- **A french couple died on a deadly hike in the New Mexico desert. They were with their 9-year-old son, who survived: he was found unconscious, but alive.** 

They succumbed to the heat: didn't bring enough water. According to [this article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/08/08/french-parents-who-died-on-new-mexico-trail-saved-sons-life-by-giving-him-their-water-sheriff-says/), the parents saved their son's life by giving him two sips of water for each one they took.

- **A 23 year-old student was found dead in a suitcase: her murderers were inspired by 'Breaking Bad'.**

Drug trafficking related: the victim owed 6,000 euros, contracted over the course of drug selling. Mind you they were not your typical drug dealers: all students in prestigious universities. ([Source](http://www.english.rfi.fr/general/20150807-french-student-found-dead-suitcase-breaking-bad-inspired-killing) if you want the gory details).

But there's a good news:

- **French hostage freed, after nearly 6 months in Yemen**.

(... I didn't even remember hearing about her kidnapping in February. But we were still busy with the followings of the January attacks I suppose). ([Source](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-33814660).)

- **French swimmers are doing good at the world championships in Russia**.

Florent Manaudou is winning lots of medals, mimicking what his sister did a few years ago.

- And **investigations on the MH370 debris have begun**.

You are all aware.

[Wiktionary](https://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/versagen) suggests, that the meaning changed as people started using *versagen* as a short form of *den Dienst versagen*. So you could say

null,null,Woodsie_Lord,null,null,null,"I did some poking and searching around. Ver- is a complicated prefix and I have never thought about it etymologically (thanks OP)

You might be interested in [this entry](http://woerterbuchnetz.de/DWB/?sigle=DWB&amp;mode=Vernetzung&amp;lemid=GV00275#XGV00275) from the brother Grimms' Wörterbuch. What I write here is my lame translation of few critical sentences/paragraphs from this entry.

Basically, ver- can be traced back to its original Indoeuropean particle/prefix *per- ([here](http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=per&amp;allowed_in_frame=0) is the etymonline.com's entry for *per-) with a wide range of meanings.

Grimms say that the original meaning of the particle ('fort, hingweg, ab') was retained in Germanic languages but also acquired multiple meanings. The original meaning then went in two directions. They both are 'a) ein hinweggehen, hinwegschaffen vom bisherigen wege, b) ein fortgehen, Fortschaffen auf dem eingeschlagenen wege bis zum vorgesteckten ziele.'

The first meaning can be seen in nhd. (neuhochdeutsch) verlaufen, vergehen, verfahren (sterben), verscheiden, verrauschen and some transitive verbs like verblasen, verbannen, verkaufen, verheiraten and others.

The second meaning is described by Grimms in a following way. 'der ort, dem etwas zustrebt, wird als der falsche, unrichtige aufgefaszt, so erhält abgehen, wegschaffen vom wege eine tadelnde nebenbedeutung:' This could be loosely translated as 'The place for which something is headed for is understood as the false, inaccurate and 'so erhält abgehen, wegschaffen vom wege eine tadelnde nebenbedeutung:' (I'm unable to really translate it) like nhd.  verführen, verleiten, verlegen, verbiegen, verdrehen, verrenken and also rich in reflexive verbs sich vergreifen, sich verlaufen, sich versteigen, sich verirren

**From this sensual meaning, a new, abstract meaning developed: the negation**. Prefix ver- directs the concept of simple verb into the opposite: nhd. verwesen, verbieten, **versagen**, verbitten, verschwören, vergessen (s. d., gegensatz zu verlornem gessen, erreichen), verachten u. ähnl",null,0,null,1439108243,null,null,false,0,ctwprvi,null,t3_3gbogj,null,null,null,t3_3gbogj,null,null,null,1440371405,null,4,null,German,t5_2qq51,4,null

One way or another, the PKK and their supporters haven't been seeing this progress, even if there appeared to be progress by the privileged. Perhaps this new violence can be an impetus for further concessions by the Turkish state, otherwise violence will escalate.

I am not sure the analogy continues to be appropriate, but a parallel can again be seen with blacks in America. While some blacks continue to achieve leadership in corporations, increase their numbers in universities, and even getting elected president, these sorts of changes were not felt by those still at the bottom of their society.

The people rioting had no way out of their conditions, and no reason to think things would get better, and this may be similar to the situations of some or most Kurds.

If anything, election of HDP to parliament and the new violence had the same cause.

Is that fickle?  

I'd accept it is.  The matter is, and this is where the Labour party fell down in thinking it wasn't that important that the previous Ed Miliband didn't have the certain 'je ne sais quoi' charisma factor, or why they didn't understand why it wasn't important that Gordon Brown DIDN'T have to gurn an obviously fake smile.  Sometimes who you are, not what you want to deliver, is very important as a politician.

Nobody, not even the Conservatives, truly thought they were going to get an outright majority.  The idea the Conservatives put forward of an anti-union SNP being in coalition with Labour, even though the SNP had effectively put off breaking from the union for a parliamentary term, was enough combined to scare them blue.

The proponents of wanting to leave the union, even though it was pretty clear they wouldn't be leaving the union in the next 5 years, was enough to exclude them from the prospect of being in a coalition government of the union.

Monarchists appear across the spectrum.  Many will balk at putting an anti-monarchist leader in power despite whatever assurances.

It's one of those red lines that will prove a deal-breaker for some.  Much as his nuclear stance will be for others.  Same with his Falkland stance.

There's just too many deal-breakers around special interests that exclude him from broad support.

This isn't that obvious. The reason is that farmers have been building a dependency on chemical fertilizers and pesticides long before the GMO appeared and by the point of the appearance of GMO, what we called biological agriculture and used to be traditional agriculture had disappeared from developped countries  for 40 to 50 years. 

I am no expert on the subject but i know it has been argued that farmers are using GMO because they are in fact completly dependant of bio-engineering companies like monsanto.

The death penalty in the UK wasn't abolished by the government of the day (and that's a pretty big, emotive thing).  It was a private members bill introduced by the then opposition, with just enough rebel MPs from the government making it happen.

If the UK goes from First Past The Post (FPTP) to a form of PR then the whole political landscape changes, and Labour would have to think that they stand a good chance of leading future rainbow coalitions.

If Labour realise two party politics is dead in the UK then all the polling will drastically change - and then what who knows?",null,0,null,1439110917,null,null,false,0,ctwqf7t,null,t3_3gb6mo,null,null,null,t1_ctwm4a4,null,null,null,1440371711,null,1,null,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

Nope, maps help to understand the territorial evolution of various entities or regions. You just discarded the maps because they contradict your narrative, right? 

You can study the history of South Ossetia with this book: https://books.google.com/books?id=AW5eBAAAQBAJ The author seems to be Russian so you can't accuse him of pro-Georgian bias. 

You'll understand that Ossetians migrated from present-day North Ossetia (back then called Ossetia) several centuries ago to the neighboring Georgian Kingdom and were cheap labor for hire for the Georgian aristocrats and after the Russian Empire disintegrated, they suddenly wanted the lands that belonged to the Georgian aristocracy and waged the war. In 1921, Georgia was invaded and in 1922 Soviet Russia awarded the territory to the Ossetians where Ossetians would form the majority and the territory was named South Ossetia.

&gt; Georgia just picked a wrong time to sucking up to US as well as wrong means to achieve its goal when it knew for a fact Russia would stop them.

Oh, I see you are anti-American and by default are biased against Georgia because Georgia is the US ally. I don't approve of what America did in Kosovo, but this does not warrant Putin's adventure in South Ossetia. 

I know many Russians who don't believe that Georgia started the war in South Ossetia or provoked the fight with Russia. Have you ever heard about the Shelling of Mainila? The Soviet Union had always denied the responsibility for starting the war with Finland and only after many decades Russia admitted to actually starting the war with Finland. 

http://www.rferl.org/content/Russia_Georgian_Scripted_Affair/1193319.html

So why were 50 Russian journalists sent to Tskhinvali even days before the war 'officially' started? Maybe Russia provoked the war and those journalists helped to propagate the Kremlin's version of history that the war in South Ossetia ""began with a surprise Georgian attack on the peaceful civilians and Russia only acted after this""? 

Among these journalists possibly was **pro-government journalist Vadim Rechkalov** who is interviewed in the Belarusian video. Just don't discard the video for its name. The video interviews independent Russian activists. Vadim explains his mission here: https://youtu.be/J8AIE7eWtSY?t=1121  and here: https://youtu.be/J8AIE7eWtSY?t=2991

Even **the former Chief of the Russian General Staff** himself admitted that they were preparing in advance to invade Georgia. http://www.jamestown.org/programs/edm/single/?tx_ttnews[tt_news]=39746

&gt;Chechnia was a region under de jure and de facto Russian control when shit happened. Ossetia and Abkhazia were neither and were under peacekeepers protection (under UN directive).

You're either lying or don't understand the situation well. If you're lying, that's exactly the reason I oppose Putin's regime. 

This Russian map is from 2005 and depicts official Russian position:  http://rus-atlas.ru/map827672_0_0.htm Abkhazia and South Ossetia are not shown here as separate territories, they were Georgian de jure back then.

The Russian peacekeepers weren't appointed by the UN, they had the mandate of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Try finding out more about the Joint Control Commission.

&gt; Had you read the report you'd know that shit started when Shakashvili came to power. Also ceasefire was unilateral and if you ask me it was a diversion. You dont move entire army to position for attack and then actually attack under ceasefire you just declared.

I've read the EU report. But unlike you, I don't accept the EU report as the single source of truth, just another opinion of some temporary commission. I've read many other reports and researches too. By the way, his name is 'Saakashvili', not 'Shakashvili'.

I too believed years ago that Georgia was at fault for the war, however after some reading and analysis, I understood that our country's leadership was lying and they provoked Georgia into the war to satisfy their ego.

Georgia unilaterally declared ceasefire, but the Ossetians did not. Ossetians did not promise ever that they would stop their attacks on the Georgian villages which had been continuing for days. So did Ossetians have the right to shell the Georgian civilian villages with heavy artillery and Georgians did not have the right to react? 

There even exists the Russian-language video on the Russian site, shot just after Saakashvili declared his ceasefire. The video shows the Russian peacekeepers at their base, who are saying that Ossetians are firing: http://euromar.livejournal.com/23918.html

&gt; Probably not. Still responding with multiple grad's on a city is a crime in itself.

That depends. If you are being fired on from any given city, you are not obliged not to respond. Maybe the Georgian response was disproportionate, but this contradicts the Kremlin's version that Georgian attack was unprovoked, right?

Besides if you had researched too well, you would know that Russian military had already evacuated vast majority of civilians from Tskhinvali days before and only several hundred civilians and several thousands of armed fighters were present in the city by 8 August 2008.

Even Russian researcher found out on the ground that South Ossetians were firing heavy artillery on Georgian civilians from Tskhinvali. http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/18/russia-georgia-war

Even after the war, Russian researchers found out that the majority of killed Ossetian 'civilians' were actually armed combatants: ""From interviews with residents of Ossetian villages and residents of the most badly damaged regions of Tskhinvali we learnt that most of the killed were the representatives of armed resistance.""  http://www.memo.ru/2008/09/19/1909082.htm

**Russian researcher** Yulia Latyinia argues that Saakashvili was faced with not a strategic, but tactical dilemma: selecting not when to clash with the invading Russians but where - at night in Tskhinvali or at dawn in Gori (well inside Georgia): http://www.ej.ru/?a=note&amp;id=8589

Below is original Russian text.

&gt; Ответ заключается в том, что в этот момент у президента Грузии больше не оставалось стратегического выбора. Его выбор был исключительно тактическим. Он мог выбирать только, где начнется война — ночью под Цхинвали или утром под Гори. Конечно, вместо того чтобы нанести встречный удар, он мог бы пожаловаться в ООН. Если бы он это сделал, то даже грузинская оппозиция сейчас не ругала бы его. 

Another Russian source  reported in August 2008 that ""22-year old contract soldier died on the first day of the bloody aggression in the Georgian-South Ossetian conflict zone, when a barrage of fire hit the peaceful town."" The soldier's mother said that his son called her on 7 August, but she did not know that he was in South Ossetia until his death.  http://web.archive.org/web/20080813155344/http://www.life.ru/video/5030

&gt; 22-летний контрактник Евгений Парфенов погиб в первый день кровавой агрессии в зоне грузино-югоосетинского конфликта, когда шквал огня  среди ночи обрушился на мирный город.
&gt; О том, что Женю отправили служить на войну в Южную Осетию, мы узнали, лишь получив похоронку... Опасаясь за мое здоровье, Женечка не стал говорить мне, что их перебросили в Цхинвал.

So that does not seem suspicious to you? If the soldier was officially stationed in Tskhinvali as a member of the peacekeeping force, then his mother would know this. But it seems that the soldier entered Tskhinvali after he talked to his mother, but before the shelling of Tskhinvali started.

Another Russian state-owned newspaper reported that soldier Maksim Pasko, who died near Gori on 12 August, sent several SMSes in August 2008. One SMS was sent on 3 August 2008 and said: ""Don't worry too much, the Georgian mercenaries are battering Tskhinvali. We were given orders to go there."" Another SMS, sent on **5 August 2008**, said: ""Yesterday, our artillerists were f****g with Georgia. 22 were killed and 150 injured."" http://www.duel.ru/200841/?41_4_1

&gt;  Из SMS-сообщений солдата-срочника, москвича, танкиста, механика-водителя Максима Анатольевича Пасько (в/ч 66431, по официальной версии погиб 12 августа в районе города Гори, точнее, за Гори, на дороге, ведущей в Тбилиси):
&gt; 3 августа, 13:02: «Сильно не переживай, боевики Грузии долбят Цхинвал. Нам дали команду ехать туда». 5 августа, 19:02: «Наши артелы [артиллеристы] вчера по Грузии е...ли. 22 убитых и 150 раненых». 11 августа, 12:17: «Прогнали грузин. Идем в наступление». 

Another pro-Kremlin site reported that tanker Vladimir said: ""We arrived in Khetagurovo **in the morning of 7 August.** Our task was to destroy the Georgian fortified district, that was located on the height near Khetagurovo."" 
http://blog.zaotechestvo.ru/2010/01/22/%D1%86%D1%85%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB-%D1%85%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0-%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%87%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F/ 

&gt;  В Хетагурово мы прибыли утром 7 августа. Нам была поставлена задача уничтожить грузинский укрепрайон, который находился на высотке недалеко от Хетагурово.

Now tell me again how did the Russian invasion not happen before the Georgians entered Tskhinvali. 

&gt; The very title ""Putins wars"" doesnt ring any bullshit detector to you? 

You don't have anything to counter the arguments of the movies or books and instead attack the titles. What should be a book called to deserve your attention, ""Saakashvili's Wars""?  I see that you are a fan of Putin.

Even the Russian Prosecutor's Office could not prove the guilt of Saakashvili in the war in South Ossetia and this was reported by the pro-Kremlin newspaper here: http://www.gazeta.ru/politics/2009/07/03_a_3218775.shtml Does not it seem strange to you that the Russian investigators could not just fabricate a false evidence against Saakashvili, like they usually do in other cases?

And you are saying that instead he shoots himself in the foot and proclaim ""restoration of constitutional power""? Ironic, considering Georgia never had constitutional power over it to begin with. At least not de facto/jure.

Even if he had announced the Russian invasion, Russia would deny this and instead accuse Saakashvili of propaganda, just like now Russia denies involvement in the war in Eastern Ukraine. I strongly believe that any state has the right to reintegrate breakaway territories. But for some strange reason you are just picking on Georgia.

Let me show you again the maps of the first Georgian republic in 1918-1921 before it was annexed by the Soviet Union.

http://www.conflicts.rem33.com/images/Georgia/arm_geor_war/map%202.gif

http://www.conflicts.rem33.com/images/Georgia/sovetizacia_1921_1.jpg

Do you see the area called 'Shida Kartli'? Tell me again how Georgia did not have any control. Russia simply demarcated some Ossetian-inhabited areas in the territory of Shida Kartli and created South Ossetia  to manipulate demographics and exercise pressure on Georgians. Even in 1991 Georgia had some control over the territory of South Ossetia.
In **1992-2008** Georgia actually controlled **51% of South Ossetia** and this is acknowledged by the state-owned Russian media **ITAR-TASS**, but you deny this fact. www.webcitation.org/5a2Sg0FSE

So, let me ask again. Some ethnic Serbian village in Slovenia declares independence as Serbian Republic and Slovenian government sends in security forces to defeat an insurgency. But suddenly Serbia invades Slovenia. Would you support your country's right to fight insurgency or would you argue that Serbia had the right to invade Slovenia? 

&gt; You are quoting a motion for resolution. In a time when EU is effectively in direct opposition to Russia. Im surprised they arent stating that Putin eats babies.

In 2009 EU wanted good relations with Russia just like the Allies wanted good relations with Germany in 1938 and by signing the Munich Agreement accepted the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. But in 1945 the Allies changed their position and restored independent Czechoslovakia.

&gt; Really? From blatant Russian aggression to getting provoked and now to preemptive strike. Ill stick to EU report, and i quote your own source: ""It was commissioned by the Council of the European Union, and written by Swiss diplomat Heidi Tagliavini, with the help of 30 European military, legal and history experts."". And this report was written after relations with Russia were somewhat normalised.

You only accept those sources that seem to parrot the pro-Kremlin line of events. But even you can find in your preferred source this conclusions such as ""any explanation of the origins of the conflict cannot focus solely on the artillery attack on Tskhinvali in the night of 7/8 August"" or this ""Additionally there seems to have been an influx of volunteers or mercenaries from the territory of the Russian Federation to South Ossetia through the Roki tunnel and over the Caucasus range in early August, as well as the presence of some Russian forces in South Ossetia, other than the Russian JPKF battalion, prior to 14.30 hours on 8 August 2008."" 

&gt; Major wake up call for me was BBC report on the conflict. First they reported live about it as a Georgian military operation to restore authority over Ossetia. Zero mention of Russians. The moment Russia got involved they did a 180° turn and presented it as blatant Russian aggression. 

The western media outlets did not have any correspondents  in the area before mid-August, so they relied initially from the manipulated reports from Moscow.

&gt; You were whining about ""Georgia had no right to send a single shell into the city [of Tskhinvali]. "". Its simplified out of context approach to justify your reasoning. Reality is much more complex.

I did not say ""Georgia had no right to send a single shell into the city [of Tskhinvali]. "" This was said by a well-known Russian researcher who had criticized the EU report for some conclusions.

I see Putin's actions as a threat to Russia since his regime bullies the neighboring countries and irritates them by meddling in their affairs. I don't think that Russia can achieve peace and understanding with her neighbors by such actions, instead we are making them enemies. I already knew in February 2014 that Putin's support of Yanukovych and adventure in Crimea would not turn out quite well for Russia.

&gt; And in a new paper (PDF) funded by the US Department of Agriculture, University of Wisconsin researchers have essentially negated the ""more food"" argument as well. The researchers looked at data from UW test plots that compared crop yields from various varieties of hybrid corn, some genetically modified and some not, between 1990 and 2010. While some GM varieties delivered small yield gains, others did not. Several even showed lower yields than non-GM counterparts. With the exception of one commonly used trait—a Bt type designed to kill the European corn borer—the authors conclude, ""we were surprised not to find strongly positive transgenic yield effects."" Both the glyphosate-tolerant (Roundup Ready) and the Bt trait for corn rootworm caused yields to drop.

Auf der anderen Seite, das Problem ist längst gelöst, und zwar ganz elegant: Dem Irak, oder genauer gesagt Saddam, wurden die iranischen Ölquellen an deren Grenze versprochen, er müsste sich die nur holen. Die Iraner mussten einen Verteidigungskampf führen, von den ursprünglichen Lieferungen ist kaum was mehr übrig, tolle Sache.

Zu doof dass die Iraner allerdings die Ölquellen erfolgreich verteidigt haben. Saddam wurde das zu bunt, die doofen Perser kämpfen zu gut, will aber trotzdem Öl, und marschiert mit seiner US-gesponsorten Armee auf Kuweit.

But really, there is no such thing as ""standard Hochdeutsch"" because every region has at least a little bit of difference. Someone (actually a speech therapist) once told me that the City/Region with the LEAST difference to Hochdeutsch is Hannover but still even they have there little things.

So. Here are some examples of my ""Hamburger Dialekt"", taken and translated from wikipedia. 

• The [l] in front of [ç] is replaced by [j]. ""Milch"" -&gt; ""Mijch/Miich"", ""Dolch"" -&gt; ""Dojch"". 

• [g] at the end of a syllable often becomes [ç] (Lenition: g -&gt; ch and t -&gt; d). ""Burg"" -&gt; ""Burch"", ""Krieg"" -&gt; ""Kriech"". ""Bitte"" -&gt; ""Bidde"", ""Leute"" -&gt; ""Leude"". 

• a long [a] is often pronounced shor and wide/broad(?): ""Rad"", ""Glas"", ""Tag"", ""Jagd"" -&gt; ""Ratt"", ""Glass"", ""Tach"", ""Jacht""

• something special is the ""Hamburger Schleifton"". [oɪ] -&gt; [oːɪ] and [uː] -&gt; [uuː] (""Mut"" vs. ""Muut""). It's particularly evident in words that would end with [ə], such as ""Leute"". ""Leute"" [loɪtə] -&gt; ""Loidee"" [loːɪdeː].

Comme beaucoup de monde la barrière de la langue peut poser problème. Du collège (middle school) au Lycée (high school) les élèves parlent en moyenne 9 minutes d'anglais par an. De plus nos deux langues ne sont pas sœurs, la vôtre est d'origine barbare anglo-saxonne ; la nôtre est d'origine latine (ce n'est pas un point de vue, c'est un fait historique). Donc l'apprentissage est compliqué notamment dans la constructions des phrases (et encore plus pour vous : accents, accords, nombres de temps).



&gt; 2) Que pensez-vous de vivre en Quebec? Ou meme Quebec en generale, je m'interesse beaucoup parce que les quebecois ont un pied dans le monde nord-americain et un pied dans l'Europe.

C'est une bonne passerelles entre États-Unis et France. Ils sont culturellement bien plus proches de vous que de nous en dehors de la question linguistique. 



&gt; 3) Que pensez-vous des britanniques, surtout en comparaison avec les americains?

Cela dépend des Français, la culture anglaise peut être perçue comme ""cool"". Les bus rouges, la reine, l'Union Jack, notre alliance contre l'Allemagne nazie etc.

Ceux ayant une véritable culture historique n'apprécient que rarement les anglais. Depuis 1066 et Guillaume le Conquérant, on les aime pas. C'est la ""Perfide Albion"". Le plus grave : Ils ont déporté notre Empereur. Je ne parlerais pas de la Guerre de Cent Ans, le fait de brûler Jeanne d'Arc. Pour parler du Québec : Ils ont persécuté les acadiens et les américains ont rejeté les acadiens jusqu'à la Louisiane. C'est assez simple, ce fut la nation la plus belliqueuse du monde, elle a été en guerre avec quasiment tous les pays existant. La City est l'une des capitales de la spéculation mondiale. Avec vous ils ont assassiné presque 70 millions d'amérindiens, je parle bien de massacres. Les Espagnols en comparaison en ont tué bien moins consciemment, c'est surtout une question de maladie.

Ils ont massacré notre marine à Mers El Kébir, tuant presque 1 300 français en 1940 alors que la Marine française restait sous notre commandement malgré la défaite. En 1942, nous avons préféré couler notre propre flotte (90% de notre Marine) à Toulon plutôt que la laisser entre les mains des nazis. Alors qu'en 1935, ils ont permis à Hitler de bâtir une marine équivalente à la nôtre, environ 35% de la Royal Navy.

En comparaison avec les américains, c'était vos maîtres, c'est devenu vos vassaux. Vous avez hérité de leur volonté hégémonique et vous avez été plus loin qu'eux.



&gt; 4) Quels sont les details / aspects les plus degoutants en ce qui concerne les Etats-Unis? Ou choquants / detestables?

Pour pas mal de Français, de nombreuses choses sont choquantes dans un pays anglophone. Je vais me concentrer sur les États-unis puisque vous êtes étasunien (un américain est un habitant des Amériques et non des États-unis d'Amérique : un péruvien, un colombien, un argentin ou un cubain sont tous américains eux aussi. C'est un détail qui a son importance).

Les Français sont généralement choqués par : 

- Votre attachement et votre pratique religieuse car nous sommes depuis plus de cent ans, une République laïque. Bien que la laïcité recule, voir votre président jurer sur la bible, voir des devises religieuses etc sont considérés comme choquants. Il en va de même avec le nombre de sectes que vous avez sur votre sol.

- Votre patriotisme. Une grande partie des Français cultivent l’auto-détestation et la culpabilisation historique depuis les 1970.

- Votre port d'arme. Beaucoup de Français sont incapables de faire la différence entre une arme qui est un outil de sécurité et les tueries qui se passent dans vos écoles. Pour un Français, la sécurité est assurée par la police et la défense par l'armée. Pour beaucoup d'entre nous, il n'y a pas de différence entre le port d'arme et ""vigilantism"". Si dans la pratique c'est faux, c'est l'image que beaucoup s'en font.

- Les tensions raciales. Dans ce domaine l'objectivité des Français est relative, ici aussi. Cela diffuse une image inégalitaire des États-Unis dotés d'une police raciste et corrompu. Ne nous en voulez pas, c'est l'image que vos médias en donnent. Dès qu'un noir meurt c'est l'émeute. Par contre un jaune, un blanc ou un hispanique ça compte pas, surtout quand on sait que davantage d'hispaniques décèdent sous les tirs de la police. Pour ce préjugé remerciez vos médias. En France une émeute (même raciale) sera souvent considérée comme un problème social de personnes qu'on aide pas assez, la question raciale ou culturelle des émeutiers ne sera jamais posée. De plus sachez que un policier qui tue quelqu'un aux États-Unis sera souvent vu comme un tueur surtout si c'est un enfant (même si l'enfant a une arme et que le policier respecte les procédures d'engagement et les sommations). Ce n'est pas logique mais en France, les forces de l'Ordre sont souvent mal perçues.

- La peine de mort. Là encore, c'est un problème culturel. Pour beaucoup de Français, peine de mort et démocratie sont incompatibles. La démocratie c'est les gentils, la peine de mort c'est les méchants. C'est illogique mais c'est la perception française.  Nous avons aboli la peine de mort il y a 24 ans mais c'est perçu comme du progressime.

Les points précédent font que les Français ont une très mauvais image du Dixieland, des habitants du Sud (sauf Miami), c'est là aussi en partie votre faute, depuis la Civil War (Guerre de Sécession en français) vous dénigrez tellement ces ""paysans"" que cela s'est répandu. Ajoutez les accents du sud, l'image du texan et de G.W. Bush et vous saurez pourquoi Dixieland est mal perçu.

Il reste : Votre politique hégémonique et impérialiste, votre système de santé qui laissent crever les pauvres, votre ""nourriture"" empoisonnée (Vous aspergez du poulet avec de la javel) qui crée des obèses à foison, le peu de congés ou les personnes cumulant des emplois pour survivent, les ravages de la drogue et l'insécurité, votre système pénitentiaire (cumul des peines), votre système éducatif et son coût qui ne favorisent que les riches, la question de l'avortement, la pénalisation de la sodomie ou d'autres pratiques sexuelles dans certains états, votre dualisme entre puritanisme et ultralibéralisme, vos banques et votre finance insatiables, votre arrogance et méconnaissance historique et votre us-centrisme etc.

On pourrait écrire un livre sur ce qui nous choque, mais c'est vrai pour n'importe quel pays vis-à-vis d'un autre pays. Il ne s'agit pas ici de faire du us-bashing, mais vous ne demandez que ce que nous percevons négativement. J'ai eu une approche, le plus neutre possible concernant le ""négatif"" si vous avez des questions sur le ""positif"" j'aurais la même méthode.

It seems like there are only two sides, either Europe should welcome these asylum seekers or you get far right candidates that are viewed (fairly or unfairly) as nazis. What seems to be missing is the more balanced approach of ""lets help the people who need it, and kick out the criminals/leaches"". 

There is that open boarders/racism dichotomy in the US too but even Obama routinely says that if somebody came here to do an honest days work and has so far not broken any other laws besides crossing illegally that they should get a chance. The condition is that they have to get in the back of the line, go through a background check to make sure they aren't criminals, learn to speak/read/write English, and if while they're waiting for their residency/citizenship they commit a crime they will be deported. 

Also take for example Donald Trump and his comments about latinos, yet despite all of the backlash from the comments he made he still has a 21% favorability rating among latinos: http://i.imgur.com/R7mHb0U.png . My roommate is Mexican and when I asked he said people are pissed at Trump but will also admit that their communities do suffer from certain criminal elements (drug traffickers) that put the entire community at risk. Their biggest fear isn't deportation, it's that drug cartels who need people fluent in English + Spanish will recruit their kids and lead them to a life of crime. 

Is it just me or does this type of debate or middle ground approach seem to be missing in Europe? The process of keeping the good guys, kicking out the bad guys, and then giving people a visa with a 5-10 year path where they must learn the language and not commit any crimes seems like a pretty reasonable approach but I don't see it being talked about over there.

Le groupe CNIM avait été choisi en 2012, un an après la signature du contrat, pour fabriquer les véhicules de débarquement de troupes livrés avec les navires de type Mistral : deux engins amphibies rapides (EDAR) de type L-Cat. Novembre 2014, le «Vladivostok» reste à quai, la livraison est suspendue pour des raisons politiques. Les chantiers DCNS et STEX se retournent vite vers leur assureur mais CNIM ne parvient pas à le faire. Résultat : des chômeurs en plus; 15% de la masse salariale du groupe. Les dirigeants de ce chantier savent depuis mercredi 5 août, 20 heures, que la facture des deux engins ne sera jamais honorée.

Shows what the readers really think. Still, I don't see this being them influencing our politics a lot. The most influence I've seen from them is when they addressed some law about I don't even remember what as a community group and the government considered their proposal.

I think you are over reacting for that ""blasphemy"" story. The company didn't get a fine for blasphemy, they got it for breaking the law of advertisement. It says that the poster offended the peoples morals and dignity. And there is a law, written in our constitution by the way, saying that ""The dignity of the human being shall be protected by law"" article 21 of the Lithuanian constitution. Also this part ""The law and the court shall protect everyone from arbitrary or unlawful interference in his private and family life, from encroachment upon his honour and dignity."" and this part: 

""Freedom to express convictions, to receive and impart information may not be limited otherwise than by law, if this is necessary to protect the health, honour and dignity, private life, and morals of a human being, or to defend the constitutional order. 

Freedom to express convictions and to impart information shall be incompatible with criminal actions—**incitement of national, racial, religious, or social hatred, violence and discrimination**, with slander and disinformation.""

I made one part in bold, because that is what barrier the ad didn't get past mostly. If our constitution says people can not insult your dignity, or discriminate your religious beliefs, then you can not do that. And that is just what it is. Needless fun-making of religion. You might also remember the song ""Šetone prašau"" that is being dragged around courts for inciting violence on children. It is a similar case. People got offended over it and the have a right to demand it not being there, because the law allows it for everyone. Also, I would add that whether you believe in God, Jesus, Christianity or not, the fact remains true that Jesus did live. I mean, it is recorded in history. You can only believe or not believe in him. Much like Muhammad also lived and you can choose to believe in him or not. So what I'm saying is making fun of Jesus or any person that really lived isn't also allowed, because he was a person.

The second one is 15 minutes by bike to the airport and there are daily flights from there to London, in the morning and evening for as little as 60$ return, if paid two months in advance

Obviously the people of Europe are not too happy with this rate of change. It is the biggest issue facing Europe yet it cannot be discussed on a European forum. This, to me, is nuts.

&gt;Immigration is the most pressing concern for Europeans, overtaking the economic situation and unemployment, according to a new Eurobarometer survey.

&gt;Thirty-eight percent of Europeans regard immigration as their main policy priority, the spring Eurobarometer poll published on Friday (31 July) found, a 14 point increase from last autumn.

&gt;Immigration seen as the major challenge facing the EU

&gt;Asking citizens about their main concerns, immigration is now at the top of the most frequently cited topics at EU level. With 38% (+14 points) it is now way ahead of the economic situation (27%, -6 points), unemployment (24%, -5 points) and the Member States public finances (23%, -2 points).

1) That Greece and the word corruption occur more frequently in the media in the run up to the election shouldnt be interpreted as manipulatibg public opinion of Syriza.

Before the election greece was not very newsworthy for ""the global media"". The election made greece newsworthy and arguably some coverage regarding higher than average corruption was also warranted.

I would agree though that most media has presented this as binary yes/no coruupted, when the reality is that all countries have some corruption.

2) I think it was a fatal flaw in making honest interpretation of data to simply brush of US dominance in the sample as ""well everyone copies what the americans write, now watch me make conclusions about manipulation everywhere""

Honesty would have been to say this sample is mostly indicative of The US. It may provide some indications of global trends. Which seems quite logical if youre searching for english words.

3) Yes, everyone discussing this through narratives and ignoring facts is a problem. EVERYONE. Including Varoufakis. Seems very dishonest to embark on a journey to identify manipulating narratives and cast Varoufakis as an innocent victim. Ive never encountered a more manipulative politician than varoufakis.

b) per fermata si intende la temporanea
sospensione della marcia anche se in area ove
non sia ammessa la sosta, per consentire la salita
o la discesa delle persone, ovvero per altre
esigenze di brevissima durata. Durante la fermata,
che non deve comunque arrecare intralcio alla
circolazione, il conducente deve essere presente e
pronto a riprendere la marcia;
c) per sosta si intende la sospensione della
marcia del veicolo protratta nel tempo, con

As far as I'm aware, the problematic coast of Libya is controlled by a radical Islamist government that is, for all practical purposes, basically ISIS. I'd like to see you make a case for investing money there.

Even disregarding that, what makes you think that a venture to ""make Libya safe"" is any less dramatic, expensive or dangerous than taking in a few hundred thousand people? It'll certainly take a lot more than paying someone off to make it a safe place.

&gt; But we are obligated to take them all back to Europe upon rescuing them.

We're not *obligated* to do so, it just happens to be the only valid/legal destination to take them to.

null,null,spacemanspiiff,DENK,Denmark,null,"&gt; Maybe there's something I'm missing, but I just can't agree with the point that article is trying to make. From my understanding, what we call ""conventional agriculture"" is literally poisoning soil, water, flora and fauna. Huge tracts of mono-culture are essentially ecologically dead. 

I think you are painting a very grim picture. I don't like the notion that chemicals and pesticides are inherently bad. That is why, I think, we need strong regulation on pesticides to make sure that is is safe for consumption.

That is also why I think we need GMO. If you saw my post with the TED-talk you will know that you can make the plants make their own specific pesticide that is harmless to humans. This means, no more unnecessary spraying. Also you can increase the nutritional value, for instance by making rice produce vitamin A - a lack of which makes thousands of people worldwide go blind every year.

&gt;I'm not saying that the ""organic"" produce we get at the super market is ideal (also mono-culture, also using pesticide)

In Denmark, you cannot use pesticides in organic farming.

&gt;The world is hugely over-populated. Isn't that the core of the problem?

No, we are not overpopulated. I hear this all the fucking time on reddit it is simply not true. All estimates put us at around 10 billion people where the growth will stop. Women stop having children when standards of living increase that is why it is key that we encourage economic growth in the 3rd world. This number is going to be a challenge, but it is not impossible to sustain.

Otherwise what do you suggest? Eugenics? One-Child policies? No thanks.

What you should have argued was that the paper i presented was an outlier, meaning a data point outside of the general trend.

White terror is completely irrelevant here, the Communists in Hungary actively collected, jailed, and murdered Hungarian noble families and wanted to create a Communist state. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Soviet_Republic
Here's a quote:
"" The nation was shocked by the Communists’ thuggish enforcers, gangs of roving toughs who intimidated and murdered their opponents in what came to be known as the Red Terror. This kind of vengeful internal violence was new to Hungary, and whatever popularity Kun’s regime had plummeted.""

Also interesting to note that the Communist leadership was all jewish; and they mass murdered ethnic Hungarian nobles. 

Stop cherrypicking the parts to portray Hungary as an anti-semitic country. Even your own source says that the Hungarian Nazis were not supported at all.
You should also link sources about Hungarians who hid jews in their own houses to save them from the Gendarmerie. Oh wait, that would portray Hungary in a good light, you don't want that. 
You still claim Hungarians supported the deportations. They didn't. As I said before, Horthy was supported the most when he tried to break off the German alliance. 
As someone else already said, if Horthy was a nazi and the citizens supported deportation, why did the deportations only start in 1944, after the Germans occupied Hungary? If the big evil Hungarians wanted to deport those jews so badly, surely Horthy would've began the deportations sooner.

Is it your goal to portray just Hungary in a bad light? You say the population supported deportation, yet they didn't and the deportations only began after Germany occupied the country. You say the leadership was also anti-semitic, yet they actually postponed Hitler's orders. Horthy is such an evil man, yet he threw the pro-Nazi prime minister out. You link the White Terror, but you forget to mention the Red Terror, which was the prequel and the cause of the White terror. The communists murdered Hungarians belonging to the old system (nobles) and wanted to create a Communist state. Horthy, on the other hand, wanted to gain back territory where Hungarians were the majority. He actually supported his own nation. The same can't be said about the Communists.

The same applies to tourism, perhaps the most important industry for Greece. Greeks would have to cut living standards to 3rd world levels if they intended to cut their income from tourism by a devalued drachma. The only way for Greece to maintain its living standards is to sell high-value tourism as part of the biggest and most prosperous market worldwide.

This is my point, the debate is human-centric. Of course we are growing food to eat for humans, but our species will not be successful in the long run unless we take care of the ecosystem of which we are part. The Times article called it efficiency. All that means is using the land more intensively for human society, less for the insects, birds and small mammals on which the health of our ecosystem also depend.

&gt; In Denmark, you cannot use pesticides in organic farming.

Don't they use copper instead? I don't want to get hung up about this point. I simply wanted to point out that I'm not suggesting ""organic"" farming should be accepted as ecologically sound without close scrutiny either.

* Stanishev himself was accused of illegally taking out government secret documents and destroying them

* Numerous corruption scandals and affairs

* When he was still leading BSP, a scandal erupted with leaked instructions to internet trolls. They confirmed the document was genuine, but instead that was not about trolling campains, it was just about ""basic pivot points our activists must adhere to""

The average geneal practiitioner/primary physician can spot major problems but subtle problems (especially the ""ticking time bombs"") require rather more specific expertise and special testing.

A basic ultrasound will tell you about the gross operation of the heart, but you need doppler devices to properly pick out valve malfunctions.

One key issue is that a 12 lead Cardiogram does not come cheap, nor does the ultrasound with doppler capability.

Ogni volta andare al ristorante con amici e' un parto. Es: e il pomodoro si' ma mai crudo, solo se e' gia' sugo. Quindi se ordinano una pizza rossa e nel menu non specificano bene che oltre al sugo ci sono dei pomodorini sopra, sbuffano quasi come bambini di 3 anni, sembra sia crollato il mondo, e si mettono a vivisezionare il cibo per scartare questa roba. Altri invece preferiscono l'esatto opposto, solo pomodori crudi e fa schifo il sugo.

E i funghi no perche' sono strani e marroni.

E le verdure poche perche' sono brutte e hanno un sapore cattivo, e poi non sei mica un coniglio.

E la minestra o una zuppa no perche' sembra di bere acqua calda e vomitano (si' e' successo) al solo pensiero di doverla prendere se non c'e' altro ed e' gia' li' pronta.

E la carne solo cottissimissima, perche' se c'e' anche solo una fibra rosa fa schifo e la mandano indietro.

E il latte solo intero. L'altro invece no, solo parzialmente scremato. Devi fare colazione insieme ti tocca svaligiare un supermercato per accontentare tutti.

Sei in viaggio, non c'e' niente da mangiare, c'e' solo del pane fresco giusto per fermare l'appetito. Fa schifo il pane da solo, non si riesce a mangiare, oltre a lamentarsi di morire di fame si lamentano perche' gli hai provato ad offrire pane senza nient'altro da metterci intorno. Pero' il pane poi lo mangiano se sono da qualche parte, mentre ci accostano qualcos'altro (tipo carne).

Vivo all'estero, siamo anche andati all'estero insieme per qualche vacanza in Europa, ogni volta e' uno strazio abissale. In Francia e Irlanda son successe le storie di vomito. Tutto perche' in ristoranti fighi, specialmente in Francia, c'era roba ""strana"" che non sono riusciti a mangiare.

So we now have two thirds of the legendary Viva Ludež (Ivančić, Lucić, Dežulović - founders of the Feral Tribune) working for Novosti, and some significant journalists of the Feral Tribune too.

The list of people that write for Novosti is impressive, I'll just put here some names: Marinko Čulić, Viktor Ivančić, Boris Dežulović, Ivica Đikić, Boris Postnikov, Zoran Daskalović, Boris Rašeta, ...

And so Dežulović entered arena and decide to do that accompanied by fanfares. He chose highly analysed topic and processed it from a different angle. As an ice on the cake he didn't use the language of the Serbs in Croatia (although he used cyrillic script) - he used the language spoken in Serbia.

In questo contesto sono abbastanza fortunato, nel senso che non esco molto con amici o altro. Quelle poche volte che mangio fuori sì, è un po' un problema, perchè si tratta di 

 - spiegare che ho un vero e proprio problema col mangiare certe cose (e quindi, per dire, non c'è verso di mangiare un kebab),
 - essere l'unico che non mangia niente, o pochissimo,
 - oppure - se mi va bene - trovare qualcosa di accettabile sul menù.

Solitamente mi va abbastanza bene e trovo qualcosa che riesca a mangiare (voglio dire, in Italia un piatto di pasta si trova sempre), ma mi è capitato abbastanza spesso di fare quello che non mangia niente, generalmente a cose come cene di Natale oppure quando andavo a giocare a casa di un mio compagno e dovevo rifiutare a tutti i costi l'invito a cena.

That's just plain wrong. In pretty much every scientific discipline there are contradicting papers. In fact, I don't know of a single discipline where this isn't the case. Not all studies are created equal either, so you can't just bring up paper ""X"" and say ""well here's a paper contradicting your paper, so there *has* to be more to this debate"". I hate to say it, but that statement proves you're unfamiliar with scientific progress and the scientific method in general.

What I'm trying to convey is that spacemanpiff made a claim, provided ""evidence"" (that meta-analysis) and since you're the one disputing it the onus is on you to prove why  he's wrong. 

Quoting part of an article doesn't even come close to proof. Instead, you should point out the flaws  (flawed inclusion criteria, flawed statistical analysis etc.) in his meta-analysis and show *why* your paper is more credible.

null,null,Rarehero,null,null,null,"&gt;My question to those familiar with the area is: where would YOU live, within commuting distance to Mülheim?

Everything from Dortmund to Duisburg and Recklingshausen to Düsseldorf is in commuting distance to Mülheim. The Ruhrgebiet is very well connected. However, the Max-Planck-Institut für Kohlenforschung is a bit further away from Mühlheim HBF (main station) and you would have an extra commute of 20 minutes inside Mühlheim.

My suggestion: Either stay in Mülheim with a short connection to you work place, or at least avoid extra commutes in the city where you want to live. For example avoid a commute that goes like this: 20 minute tram ride inside Essen to reach the main station &gt; short train connection to Mülheim &gt; 20 minutes commute inside Mülheim. Did that for years between Duisburg-Rheinhausen and my university or my work place in Düsseldorf. No fun!

So when you decide to live in Düsseldorf, Essen or Dortmund, rent a place from where you can reach the central station and avoid an extra commute.

Stick to your plan of using public transportation network. It's fantastic, save, cheap, mostly clean and many connections are even available at night. Buses, trams and subways also connects between the neighboring cities, like for example Mülheim Stadtmitte with the CentrO (a large Mall and gastronomy park) in Oberhausen. So if you chose the location of your apartment wisely you will never need a car, which will save you a lot of money. 

Inside or near Mülheim I can suggest the following places:

- Mülheim-Stadtmitte obviously, from the ""Hauptbahnhof"" (Main Station). Some corners are pretty ""meh"" like the shopping are with rundown shops and buildings, others are really nice like for example that entire region near the Ruhr with beautiful parks (Müga-Park) and old buildings. The are around your work-placer is quite nice too with many history buildings. Unfortunately Mülheim isn't covered in StreetView, but Panoramio and the bird view in BING help you to explore the Stadtmitte. Mülheim is a small city, so don't expect a very vibrant night-life. Obvious plus: Short connections to literally everywhere in the Ruhrgebiet and beyond (most long distance trains stop in Mülheim).


- Speldorf and Broich. The tram-line 901 connects the city centers of Duisburg and Mülheim. You would switch lines at the station ""Stadtmitte"". Not in walking distance of a train station anymore, but both districts are quite nice with an interesting mix of nature and industrial buildings especially in Broich. The southern parts of Broich near the Broich Friedhof (cemetery) have some very nice places to live (I considering moving there) with old parks, alleys and a great view across the Ruhr valley. You would have a beautiful bike commute far away from cars on public walkaways that lead down the Saarnberg/Kassenberg (?) and across the Ruhr via a small small island (Kassenbergbrücke). Unfortunately on your way home you would have to climb the mountain. Oh, did I mention that there is a castle in Broich? :) Night life is quiet, but bars and restaurants are within reach.

- Saarn, south of Broich. Very quiet, very nice. Not much to do probably, but close to nature with a large forest to the West and open plains to the South and East. Nice commute across the Mendener Brücke or the Ruhrinselweg.

- Duisburg Kaiserberg, the easternmost district of Duisburg around the Kaiserberg with the Zoo and the university. Connection to Mülheim-Stadtmitte via the subway-/tram-line 901. Nice and quiet with the city forest nearby. Close connection to the main station and the city-center. Unfortunately, well, it's Duisburg. The city is dying. Apart from two nice but small malls and a lot of (not quite spectacular) gastronomy there isn't that much to see or to do. The theater, the Lehmbruck museum, the Landschaftspark, the harbor of course. But these aren't reasons to live there. Still, Duisburg-Kaiserberg is a good place to live.



Can't say much about the norther and eastern districts of Mülheim, so let's talk about other cities that are just a short train ride (up to 30 minutes) away from Mülheim:

- Duisburg (5 to 10 minutes) - Like I said above, probably don't do it. Have lived in Duisburg my entire life and quite frankly there are better and more interesting cities in reach.

- Düsseldorf (25 to 30 minutes) - Feels much larger and more metropolitan than the 600.000 citizens it has. But while it is part of the ""Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan area"" it is not part of the Ruhrgebiet anymore and doesn't have the same flair (whatever one might think of that) and diversity of the Ruhrgebiet. However, if you find an affordable place in reach of the central station (a short ride with the subway would be okay I guess), you will have a vibrant night life, great shopping, lots of culture. And snobs. And an international airport (but you can reach the airport from everywhere else as well, and how often do you really need an airport?).

- Essen (5 to 10 minutes) - The same as Düsseldorf, just not with the same ""chic"". And without an airport. Night-life probably a bit worse than Düsseldorf, but I think that Essen is even better for shopping because of the shorter walks. Rents should be cheaper and you would be at the heart of the Ruhrgebiet. Avoid extra commutes.

- Dortmund (25 to 30) - More or less same as Essen.

Quindi se ordinano una pizza rossa e non specificano bene che oltre al sugo ci sono dei pomodorini sopra, sbuffano quasi come bambini di 3 anni, sembra sia crollato il mondo, e si mettono a vivisezionare il cibo per scartare questa roba.

Questo succede anche a me. Se nel cibo ci sono pezzi di qualcosa che non riesco a mangiare, mi metto a ""vivisezionarlo"" per rimuoverli, finchè sono sicuro che il piatto sia accettabile.

&gt;E i funghi no perche' sono strani e marroni.

Più o meno. Non è che non mangerei un fungo ""perchè è marrone"", ma comunque l'aspetto conta molto.

Gli altri esempi sembrano più capricci che non una vera e propria ""paura del cibo"", però non saprei (quello del latte è ovviamente unn capriccio, la cosa della zuppa potrebbe essere legit).

Per la cosa dell'estero can confirm, di solito è più problematico perchè la cucina è diversa e non si trovano altrettante cose accettabili (tant'è che al momento sono in Germania, e quando mangio fuori frequento un ristorante italiano gestito da italiani). Però boh, addirittura vomitare non mi è successo, se c'è qualcosa che non mi piace mi limito a non mangiarla.

* Anthrax found in another animal in Varna region which caused another mini-panic. Since the outbreak, they found 4 infected animals, one person died, all meat in contact with meat from that farm was withdrawn from market and destroyed and they are now mass-vaccinating cattle in the region.

* Landslide in Varna cut the road of 300 people to their houses.

Police was called. ( http://nakratko.bg/Photos/20150805121424-1.jpg )

* The regional governor of Razgrad region crashed his car in a tree. 0.3% alchohol in his blood, 6 times over the legal threshold.

* Two undercover tax inspectors were ""hijacked"" and threatened by a taxi driver in Sv.Vlas. 

* Bulgaria will be building airplanes again after decades. Though just small private airplanes in a factory near Sofia

* Unemployment down to 9.4%

* A private hospital became the first one to lose its license due to cheating the national healthcare fund. Also policemen from the Sigma unit charged for corruption

* Prisoners from Burgas prison escaped and got caught after a few hours

* Robbie Williams at Spirit of Burgas with 35000 fans partying on the beach. ( http://kanal3.bg/assets/uploads/gallery/4935_660_370.jpg )

Quite the contrary. The thing is that we are moving into epistemiologic here. Karl popper demonstrated that no scientific theory could be absolutely demonstrated : you can only accumulate scientific evidences in its favor while it can be disapproved by only one piece of contradictory evidence. For popper, we do not demonstrate theories, we demonstrate *confidence*, which brings you into your second point. 

&gt; Not all studies are created equal either, so you can't just bring up paper ""X"" and say ""well here's a paper contradicting your paper, so there has to be more to this debate"".

Good thing i didn't then. What is said is this : here's a paper contradicting your paper, so there **might** to be more to this debate"".

&gt; What I'm trying to convey is that spacemanpiff made a claim, provided ""evidence"" (that meta-analysis) and since you're the one disputing it the onus is on you to prove why he's wrong. 

Only if am a proponent of a theory or a scientific statement myself. Which is not the case here. I provided the paper to make room for a debate, not to say that he is wrong and that i am right.

&gt; Quoting part of an article doesn't even come close to proof. 

True but i wasn't here to prove a point, just rising a challenge.

&gt; Instead, you should point out the flaws (flawed inclusion criteria, flawed statistical analysis etc.) in his meta-analysis and show why your paper is more credible. This probably requires an extensive scientific background in GMO research though. 

This would have been better but i don't have that background. Nevertheless, i don't think that providing seemingly contradictory data and rising challenges should only be limited to the field expert. As long as you are not stating but questionning with an open mind and intesterest for truth, anyone can (and in my view, should) enter the scientific debate.

&gt; In fact, I don't know of a single discipline where this isn't the case.

Là encore les cartouches annoncent ne plus contenir d'encre alors qu'il peut en rester encore.

null,null,xXxNOSCOPEPrincipxXx,BOSN,Young Bosnia and Herzegovina,null,"Jedan od najukorijenjenijih hrvatskih mitova jest onaj o Hrvatima kao sportskoj naciji. Je li riječ o klimi i geografiji, jesu li brutalne kondicijske pripreme kroz tegobnu povijest, je li psihologija i domoljubna motivacija, je li neka genetska mutacija ili je zaista za sve odgovoran dragi Bog, hrvatska se znanost još spori. Da su Hrvati, međutim, svjetski sportski fenomen, u to se ovdje službeno ne sumnja. 

Zašto bi, međutim, dragi Bog sportskim talentom blagoslovio baš Hrvatsku, a ne, recimo, Bjelorusiju, Češku, Kazahstan, Gruziju, ili, štajaznam, Azerbajdžan? Dobro, to da je naš Svevišnji malo pristran pa navija za svoje katolike, čini se razumnim ogovorom, ali ostaje onda ozbiljnom teološkom zagonetkom zašto i islamski Azerbajdžan i pravoslavna Gruzija imaju više olimpijskih medalja od nas. I zašto muslimanski Kazahstan i ateistička, pivopijska Češka imaju dva puta, a pravoslavna Bjelorusija tri i pol puta više medalja od Hrvatske. 

Ako mislite da je nepravedno sportski talent mjeriti brojem olimpijskih medalja, jer je Hrvatska jedna od najmlađih članica Međunarodnog olimpijskog komiteta, sa samo šest Olimpijada na kostima, valja vam znati da su sve navedene olimpijske sile još mlađe, sa po samo pet Olimpijada u biografiji. A ako pak mislite da je hrvatski sportski talent neporavedno mjeriti s mnogoljudnijim nacijama, možemo i u medaljama po broju stanovnika: ispred Hrvatske u tom su slučaju čak i neke nešto manje sportske velesile od nje, poput Grenade, Djevičanskih Otoka i Nizozemskih Antila, a od olimpijskih vršnjaka još i Slovenija i Slovačka i sva tri baltička sportska fenomena - Latvija, Litva i Estonija. 

Dobro, olimpijske statistike nisu znanstveno referentne, Hrvati su, kako je poznato, svjetski fenomen u muškim, timskim, loptačkim sportovima, a na Olimpijadama se medalje dijele u kojekakvim bizarnim natjecanjima koje prate još samo familije sudionika - dizanju utega, bacanju diska, pucanju iz zračne puške, zrakomlaćenju na konju s hvataljkama ili onim smiješnim borbama u rukavicama, šljemovima i kućnim ogrtačima. Argument je svakako validan, osim što su dvije trećine od svoje dvadeset tri olimpijske medalje Hrvati osvojili u tim bizarnim neloptačkim sportovima koje prate samo familije sudionika. Od kojih im je dvije osvojio Bugarin, a jednu Talijan rođen u Sloveniji s prezimenom Crnogorac. 

Da vidimo onda kako stojimo u muškim, timskim, loptačkim sportovima? U košarci su Hrvati nešto i značili dok nisu dobili državu: otada ih nitko nije vidio sve do prošlog vikenda, kad su osvojili četvrto mjesto u Europi. Kao i strašni Makedonci prije njih, ili strašni Slovenci prije Makedonaca. Vaterpolo? Vrlo dobro, tu smo olimpijski, svjetski i europski prvaci. Što god to značilo u sportu koji se ozbiljno igra u ukupno šest-sedam zemalja, koje su podijelile sve medalje od Drugog svjetskog rata do danas. Rukomet? Ako smo sportski fenomen zato što smo jednom bili prvaci svijeta, što je onda točno Rumunjska, četverostruki svjetski prvak? Odbojka? Ragbi? Dobro, idemo dalje. Nogomet? 

Pričajmo o tome. Hrvatska je jednom davno bila treća na svijetu u nogometu, i to je svakako zadivljujući rezultat. Nije mnogo zemalja izvan kruga nogometnih velesila jednom davno osvojilo broncu na Mundijalu. Osim Turske i Čilea. Da, i Austrije. I Sjedinjenih Država. I Poljske, dva puta. Da, i Švedske također. Dva puta. Ne računajući, dakako, češke pivopije koji su jednom bili i u finalu Mundijala. Pa tako dva puta. 

Od hrvatskih klubova, recimo, u svih dvadeset i kusur godina famozno “proljeće u Europi“ izborio je samo Hajduk i samo jednom, dok je nuklearni Dinamo posljednji put tamo prezimio onih dana kad je Neil Armstrong još sanjao da će jednog dana šetati po Mjesecu. Dočim su od manjih nogometnih sila od Hrvatske proljeće u Europi dočekivali još samo klubovi iz Poljske, Rumunjske i Bugarske. Eh da, i Švicarske. I Škotske. I Ukrajine. I Danske. I Austrije. I Češke. I Izraela. Da, i iz Cipra. I Srbije. I nitko više. 

Sve u svemu, Hrvati su sasvim prosječan sportski fenomen, ni nevjerojatan, ni vjerojatan, ni najbolji, ni najgori, ništa više, ništa manje. I još možemo biti sretni: što bi tek bilo da nas dragi Bog nije blagoslovio fantastičnim sportskim talentom?

You are doing your math wrong.

20k net means AFTER expenses... for having that amount NET, I'd say you have a Porsche.

So, I am gonna correct you there:

20k GROSS income (not NET)

- minus 0.65k freelance tax
- minus 4.5k health insurance tax (around)
- minus 1/3 of utilities expenses (RENT,electricity, water, mobile, internet, phone) (in my case, that's about 3k) -if your house if your office OR 100% utilities expenses from your office.
- minus Professional expenses (in my case, last year were about 8k - computer, mobile, gas, etc, etc...)


That would leave me with 3.85k NET income, that is 3.850 euro net income - THERE's where you apply the 29% + 100% year advance, not the 20k.

That means I'll pay 1116.5 euro (29%) plus 1116.5 (29% advance from next year) minus what I paid last year as advance for this one.

null,null,littlegermany,GERM,Deutschland,null,"Das ist bei der FAZ schon seid einiger Zeit so, auch bei einigen anderen wie SPON. Ich glaube, die haben einfach kapituliert vor dem schieren Umfang unerfreulicher Scheisse, die manche Themen mit sich bringen. Das kann ich gut nachvollziehen; wie schon andere hier schrieben, lese ich die Kommentare bei Artikeln grosser Onlineportale auch meistens nur noch zur Unterhaltung.

Du schriebst, dass ""diverse sehr laute Gruppen"" sich nun beschweren, und dass solche Aktionen Wasser auf deren Mühlen sind. Dem halte ich entgegen, dass eben diese lauten Gruppen in den Kommentarspalten ohne viel Inhalt einfach nur laut sind und eine mögliche Diskussion damit zum primitiven Abrotzen und Rumkotzen verkommt. M.E. sollten diese sich mal an die eigene Nase fassen und sich fragen, inwieweit sie das mitverantworten, denn das ist einer der Hauptgründe dafür, dass Kommentarspalten geschlossen bleiben. Da bleibe ich aber skeptisch, denn es ist einfacher, von Zensur und Meinungsfreiheit zu krakeelen.

Ich denke, im Netz eine gute Diskussion zu führen erfordert eine gewisse Ruhe. Als ich in den 90'ern aufs Usenet der Mailboxszene traf, gabs eigentlich eine recht gute Regel in der Netiquette: Lesen, Denken, Lesen, Antworten. Heute ist es oft nur noch: Überschrift lesen, Kommentieren. Daraus soll irgendwas Sinnvolles entstehen? Glaube ich nicht. Bei Fefe's Blog kann ja gar nicht kommentiert werden. Er schrieb selber mal dazu, dass man ihm aber gerne Emails zukommen lassen kann, was anscheinend auch einige tun. Ich glaube seiner Aussage, dass das Emailfeedback ein weitaus höheres Niveau hat als es eine Kommentarfunktion jemals haben kann. Vielleicht liegt das u.a. auch daran, dass Emails eine persönlichere Natur haben, denn ""ICH schreibe DIR"" etwas, was sich spätestens in der Verwendung einer Anrede wie ""Hallo Fefe"" oder ""Sehr geehrte Frau Meier"" zu Beginn der Email äussert. Das verhindert natürlich keine bitterbösen Briefe zorniger Mitmenschen.

Aber gut, Leserbriefe/Emails sind etwas anderes als öffentliche Kommentare, die auf kurz und schnell verfasst ausgelegt sind. Die laden ja gradezu dazu ein, mal eben kurz seinen Frust loszulassen und mit unreflektiertem Müll ""den anderen"" mal zu zeigen, wo der Hammer hängt. Diese Einstellung der Kommentatoren finde ich übrigens typisch - Der Grundton in Kommentarspalten ist eigentlich immer aggressiv. Ein wenig finde ich das auch systematisch, denn z.B. die Kommentarsysteme auf Spiegel und Zeit sind nicht auf Diskussion ausgelegt. Diskussionen bestehen ja aus Rede und Antwort, und dort zusammenhängende Kommentare finden ist lachhaft! Bei der FAZ ist es etwas besser. Aber ansonsten gilt wohl: Rotz es raus, um mehr gehts nicht.

Einige Artikelgruppen brauchen auch keine Kommentarfunktion. Bei meiner Lokalzeitung kann man den Bereich Polizeiberichte nicht kommentieren. Wozu auch? Das sind eh nur Meldungen über Fehlverhalten deiner Mitmenschen, was will man da noch gross kommentieren? Ein Kommentarbereich hier wäre reines Rumkotzen.

They found that organic farming delivered a lower yield for every crop type, though the disparity varied widely. For rain-watered legume crops like beans or perennial crops like fruit trees, organic trailed conventional agriculture by just 5%. Yet for major cereal crops like corn or wheat, as well as most vegetables—all of which provide the bulk of the world’s calories—conventional agriculture outperformed organics by more than 25%.

No. You found a specific ancient map of specific time that conforms to your bias. Its absurd. I showed you a map of Russian Empire that has no Georgia at all, so lets go with that map because i like it. See how stupid it is?
&gt;The author seems to be Russian so you can't accuse him of pro-Georgian bias.

Another gem of ignorance and naivety.
&gt;Oh, I see you are anti-American and by default are biased against Georgia because Georgia is the US ally. I don't approve of what America did in Kosovo, but this does not warrant Putin's adventure in South Ossetia.

Im realist and thats how geopolitics work. US set a precedent and Russia used it when Shakasvili went full retard.
&gt;I know many Russians who don't believe that Georgia started the war in South Ossetia or provoked the fight with Russia.

Then you know many idiots. You have Georgians publicly stating what they are doing and video footage of massive bombardment of Tshinkvali.
&gt; Maybe Russia provoked the war

And a woman in bikinis is provoking rape. Get real ffs.
&gt;Among these journalists possibly was pro-government journalist Vadim Rechkalov who is interviewed in the Belarusian video. Just don't discard the video for its name. The video interviews independent Russian activists. Vadim explains his mission here

Dude... That video is ""in your face"" type of propaganda. Just look at their rhetorical questions and how they are formed. And claim that Russians had videos of stuff before the conflict? And than it shows 5s of out of context video... gtfo.

Have you seen videos of Georgian mlrs's bombarding Tshinkvali? Were those made by Russians before war as well?
&gt;Even the former Chief of the Russian General Staff himself admitted that they were preparing in advance to invade Georgia. http://www.jamestown.org/programs/edm/single/?tx_ttnews[tt_news]=39746[5]

Shitload of claims and none backed with sources. Also an attempt at pushing a narrative that Medvedev somehow cares about ""Last days"".
&gt;This Russian map is from 2005 and depicts official Russian position: http://rus-atlas.ru/map827672_0_0.htm[6] Abkhazia and South Ossetia are not shown here as separate territories, they were Georgian de jure back then.

De jure means that they follow Georgian laws. They dont.
&gt;I've read the EU report. But unlike you, I don't accept the EU report as the single source of truth, just another opinion of some temporary commission. I've read many other reports and researches too.

You are throwing blatant propaganda at me as if it means something, so forgive me for not believing you. If anything its insulting that you thought id fall for that crap.
&gt;There even exists the Russian-language video on the Russian site, shot just after Saakashvili declared his ceasefire. The video shows the Russian peacekeepers at their base, who are saying that Ossetians are firing: http://euromar.livejournal.com/23918.html

He declared a unilateral ceasefire and then broke it. I presume it was meant to gain element of surprise for follow up bombardment and invasion. Prepositioned artillery and military attest to that.
&gt;That depends. If you are being fired on from any given city, you are not obliged not to respond. Maybe the Georgian response was disproportionate, but this contradicts the Kremlin's version that Georgian attack was unprovoked, right?

There were constant skirmishes from both sides and considering Georgia prepositioned its entire military before the attack we can suspect what their goal was. And that goal was publicly stated by Shakashvili and his generals.
&gt;Even Russian researcher found out on the ground that South Ossetians were firing heavy artillery on Georgian civilians from Tskhinvali. http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/18/russia-georgia-war[8]

From your own link... ""Oleg Orlov, the head of Memorial, said artillery **exchanges** across the border with South Ossetia began on August 1"". This also explains why people were fleeing.
&gt;Even after the war, Russian researchers found out that the majority of killed Ossetian 'civilians' were actually armed combatants: ""From interviews with residents of Ossetian villages and residents of the most badly damaged regions of Tskhinvali we learnt that most of the killed were the representatives of armed resistance."" http://www.memo.ru/2008/09/19/1909082.htm

Few more gems from that link:

-At night of August 7/8 armed forces of Georgia carried out an attack on South Ossetia. Indiscriminate use of force was applied. Tskhinvali and villages where civilians remained were subjected to fire with weapons of indiscriminate effect, primarily from multiple rocket launchers “Grad”.

- Certain damages could have been inflicted by the artillery, but the residents  reported only damages during the attacks on the night of 7/8 August, when the Russian army had not yet approached Tskhinvali.

And here goes the idea that Russians were already there.

- Georgian population had virtually completely left the enclave villages on the eve of the Georgian attack on South Ossetia, persuaded to do so by the local pro-Georgian administration, which promised them a rapid return.
&gt;Russian researcher Yulia Latyinia argues that Saakashvili was faced with not a strategic, but tactical dilemma: selecting not when to clash with the invading Russians but where - at night in Tskhinvali or at dawn in Gori (well inside Georgia): http://www.ej.ru/?a=note&amp;id=8589[10]

Right. In your own link (http://www.memo.ru/2008/09/19/1909082.htm) it states an attack on Thinkvali happened when there were no Russian forces there (except peacekeepers). Also all analyses of the military aspect of the conflict state that Georgia was completely unaware of any Russian military that was stationed in North Ossetia. And when Russia did get involved Georgia made no serious attempts at fighting them - which again contradicts narrative that Georgia wanted to fight ""invading Russians"".
&gt;Another Russian source reported in August 2008 that ""22-year old contract soldier died on the first day of the bloody aggression in the Georgian-South Ossetian conflict zone, when a barrage of fire hit the peaceful town."" The soldier's mother said that his son called her on 7 August, but she did not know that he was in South Ossetia until his death. http://web.archive.org/web/20080813155344/http://www.life.ru/video/5030[11]

The title literally states he was a peacekeeper.
&gt;Another SMS, sent on 5 August 2008, said: ""Yesterday, our artillerists were f****g with Georgia. **22 were killed and 150 injured**.""

That is very specific and there is no collaborative information on that. Also that info is suppose to have come from Russian tanker that got killed in Gori region on August 12th. Which is strange considering Gori got evacuated by Georgians by 11th August and i cant think of a single engagement that Georgians managed to destroy a tank and drive out rest of Russian forces so they could loot it.
&gt;Another pro-Kremlin site reported that tanker Vladimir said: ""We arrived in Khetagurovo in the morning of 7 August. Our task was to destroy the Georgian fortified district, that was located on the height near Khetagurovo.""

You know these are all unverified claims? None of these were substantiated by any independent source. And to top it off even Georgia never claimed they were fighting Russian invasion when they launched their attack.
&gt;You don't have anything to counter the arguments of the movies or books and instead attack the titles. What should be a book called to deserve your attention, ""Saakashvili's Wars""? I see that you are a fan of Putin.

Im fan of no one. Titling a book ""Putins war"" is huge indication that its biased. No objective book would be titled in a way that demonizes someone from get go.
&gt;Even the Russian Prosecutor's Office could not prove the guilt of Saakashvili in the war in South Ossetia and this was reported by the pro-Kremlin newspaper here: http://www.gazeta.ru/politics/2009/07/03_a_3218775.shtml[14] Does not it seem strange to you that the Russian investigators could not just fabricate a false evidence against Saakashvili, like they usually do in other cases?

As far as google translate... He wasnt found guilty because they had no access to Georgian documents.
&gt;Even if he had announced the Russian invasion, Russia would deny this and instead accuse Saakashvili of propaganda, 

That literally hasnt stopped him from doing just that when Russia actually got involved.
&gt;So, let me ask again. Some ethnic Serbian village in Slovenia declares independence as Serbian Republic and Slovenian government sends in security forces to defeat an insurgency. But suddenly Serbia invades Slovenia.

Exactly what happened in Kosovo. US made sure it will happen elsewhere as well.
&gt;In 2009 EU wanted good relations with Russia 

Just lol.
&gt;You only accept those sources that seem to parrot the pro-Kremlin line of events.

I accept objective sources that source their claims. Read up on how propaganda works.
&gt;The western media outlets did not have any correspondents in the area before mid-August, so they relied initially from the manipulated reports from Moscow.

loooooooool They literally had **direct** access to Shakashvili 24/7.

I am not naive enough to expect any pension because we'll all probably be working well into our 80s and possibly 90s and I don't trust the Romanian government with 1.2 birthrates to sustain me with a pension 50 years from now.

I don't see why anyone would register as a freelancer instead of a limited liability company if the taxes were not lower for freelancing tbh.


Moreover, I could move to another country, work from there (as a freelance programmer) but issue the invoices on my company in Romania, pay taxes here and because of the double-taxation principle applicable across the EU, I would not be held to pay taxes in my place of residence.

Il cast è ottimo e la ""grafica"" sarà sicuramente splendida, così ad occhio pronostico un ottimo film, godibile ed emozionante come gravity.

TL;DR
Supporters from the city of Brzeg went to support Śląsk Wrocław and displayed the coat of arms of their city and later Śląsk Wrocław was penalised with a 15k Euro fine, with the reason quoted as there having been a banned symbol on display at the stands. 
The representatives of the football club were later able to piece together that it may have been the coat of arms of Brzeg, since the UEFA delegate inquired about it and stared at it for a while.

Notes:
TITLE - ""Slask Wroclaw UEFA punished for arms Shore"" should be ""UEFA punishes Śląsk Wrocław for the coat of arms of Brzeg""

Questa è una grossa cazzata purtroppo, e voglio fartelo capire. Ascoltami bene, ti faccio un esempio un po' crudo.

Se domani ti viene la DEPRESSIONE, che è un disturbo psicologico esattamente come l'ARFID, rischi di seguire lo stesso processo. Ovvero renderti conto che ce l'hai, NON andare dal medico, rischiare di buttare via anni della tua vita a piangere sul letto o farti fisicamente del male o peggio ancora. 

Se tu avessi scritto ""Non mi piacciono i piselli, AMA"" oppure ""il medico mi ha diagnosticato ARFID, AMA"" non mi farei certo queste preoccupazioni. Ma voglio farti capire bene due cose importantissime nel mondo delle persone adulte del quale tu stai entrando in questi anni a far parte.

- Non ci si fanno le diagnosi da soli, SPECIALMENTE per quanto riguarda la psicologia
- Se si è malati, si va dal medico. No exceptions.

&gt; Non capisco come essere cosciente di avere una malattia, se così vogliamo chiamarla, porti ad assumere comportamenti più dannosi

Se un domani il processo che ""delinei"" ti porta a scegliere un numero ancora minore di alimenti che ""ti vanno"", cosa succede? Non pensare che sarà sempre come adesso, lo stress e altri fattori esterni potrebbero farti sentire ancora più a disagio. Potresti avere delle carenze vitaminiche, potresti diventare anoressico o bulimico, potresti cambiare completamente approccio al cibo e diventare obeso.

Wildfleisch war der erste Lösungsansatz, aber das wird auf Dauer auch langweilig (insbesondere, weil das Angebot da recht begrenzt ist. Oftmals gibts ""nur"" Rehrücken und Wildschwein-/Rehkeule). Selber jagen habe ich auch kurz in Betracht gezogen, aber mangels eines Autos fällt das bei mir flach.

Nächster Versuch: Rindfleisch aus vernünftiger Haltung kaufen (wäre für mich dann Weiderind, ich halte konventionelle Rindermast für nicht tiergerecht). Mangels lokaler Quellen wäre das dann die Großbestellung beim Händler, macht erst ab größeren Mengen Sinn (10 kg-Pakete waren glaube ich das kleinste, was ich damals gefunden hatte). Da ich keine Lust hatte, mir eine extra Kühltrühe anzuschaffen fiel das dann auch weg.

Das kann bei dir natürlich anders aussehen, wenn du um die Ecke einen Bauernhof hast, der Tiere (nach deinen Maßstäben) vernünftig aufzieht.

The black market, the grey market, smugglers, BitCoin &amp; The DeepWeb disagree with you.

&gt; The state is the result of irreconcilable class differences in society.

The state is the result of coercion by a bunch of people, vile and/or stupid filled with greed, in which they think there cannot exist order without mandatories, force &amp; authority. Add tributes (taxation) &amp; bribery and you have your usual potpourri we know today. I call it the ""legal mafia"" sometimes.

&gt;In a capitalist system with no state, what prevents the workers from taking what is rightfully theirs? Nothing, and they would do so until the capitalists form a state to stop them.

In a capitalist society, in which the ""capitalist system with no state"" assertion is a fallacy since capitalism =/= state with no common ground, the workers wouldn't have anything to take back what they'd perceive as ""rightfully theirs"". That's called theft. And what's rightfully mine, and not what is perceived as ""theirs"", would be protected from such theft conspiracy using any means necessary, any tools &amp; any ways possible, from private security firms/forces, to personal protection. Why should I pay tribute (aka. tax; aka. protection racket) to the mafiosi state that I could provide using without it? 

What you perceive freedom as to kill because of collective motivations (""taking back what's ours"", aka. theft), sociopathy, psychopathy and downright mass murder mentality (gee, where did I heard/see that before?); I perceive freedom, as to protect what's yours by any means neccesary from such goons that want to burn everthing to ashes just because they were too stupid, too narrow-minded, and too vile to adapt to these norms in society. After all, what they don't like, they are free to leave, they're not forced to work for me if they don't want to. In consequence, if people like me were to be killed by such goons, the dark ages would return again, steadfast. Over time, those goons would sign their deaths themselves.

For example, the tax year there runs April-April, and has to be filed by next January. So for example for the April 2014 - April 2015 tax paperwork and final payments are due by January 2016.

But if you are self-employed for more than one year, then they estimate your *current* year's income based on the previous one, and make you pay tax for it in portions every 3-6 months. And by next January, you file the complete tax paperwork, and either pay extra or get a refund on the difference between estimated and actual accurate tax liability.

You're not *pre-*paying for the next year... if the estimates are accurate, then you are paying tax approximately at the same time while you're earning the income that it's based on.

My guess is that this is done mainly to avoid self-employed people who forget to set aside a proportion of their income for tax, and become unable to pay it at the end of the year. You can opt out of paying during the year in portions, if you believe that the next year's income will be lower than the previous (so the estimate would be an overestimate).

I've yet to see a sentence that makes more sense logically. If I leave my current country, and immigrate to a new one, the new one can count me in their population statistics and the old one no longer can. If I move my computer from my bedroom to the kitchen, the kitchen will have gained one computer and the bedroom lost one.

&gt;The birth rate from the country of origin is still the same, isn't it? Meaning that those that emigrated are replaced in no time.

Let's create an imaginary country and add in some assumptions:

-every person has one child (just to illustrate the math, this works with any number of children just as well)
-the number of people in our country is 'n'

Two scenarios:
1)

If one person emigrates, the population number can be represented as 'n-1' (assuming everything else remains the same). Now if someone has a child, the population will stand at 'n'. Our emigrant will have a child in their new adopted country, so it won't affect this country's population.

2)

If that specific person did not emigrate, the population will stand at 'n'. Now the same person who brought our population level back to n by having a child in the previous scenario will bring our pop to 'n+1' in this one. Also the person who emigrated in our previous scenario will have a child so the population is now 'n+2'.

Now if you multiply the number of emigrants by the tens of thousands - if not hundreds of thousands or millions, this will have a very significant impact.


&gt;In fact, you are preventing those countries from ever reaching population saturation.

Any literature on this population saturation? The population growth will decline once standards of living increase and women gain more rights and a better education.

I got down the book, and read all I came to read; and then, in an unthinking moment, I idly turned the leaves, and began to indolently study diseases, generally.  I forget which was the first distemper I plunged into—some fearful, devastating scourge, I know—and, before I had glanced half down the list of “premonitory symptoms,” it was borne in upon me that I had fairly got it.

I sat for awhile, frozen with horror; and then, in the listlessness of despair, I again turned over the pages.  I came to typhoid fever—read the symptoms—discovered that I had typhoid fever, must have had it for months without knowing it—wondered what else I had got; turned up St. Vitus’s Dance—found, as I expected, that I had that too,—began to get interested in my case, and determined to sift it to the bottom, and so started alphabetically—read up ague, and learnt that I was sickening for it, and that the acute stage would commence in about another fortnight.  Bright’s disease, I was relieved to find, I had only in a modified form, and, so far as that was concerned, I might live for years.  Cholera I had, with severe complications; and diphtheria I seemed to have been born with.

A perfect example is the shift of what we used to call the far left from social issues (traditionally, class struggles) to societal concerns (racism, gay rights etc). Working classes were always societal conservatives, and they are today fleeing the far left (Trotskists, neo Marxists) and giving votes to the ""far right"" which is the only avenue for their political ideas about immigration (among other things) to be simply conveyed, itself also employing traditional Marxist rhetoric. 
Yet if you listen to the Left, they still somehow lay claim to the language and symbolism of class struggle and despite being Bourgeois parties full of university students and middle class service workers, they act as if they were still representatives of the working class.

The political spectrum inhabited by political parties is totally at odds with the general opinions of the population, taking them at their word when they ascribe themselves a position prevents us from recognizing the magnitude of the crisis.

Mais globalement, Israel souffre, comme le reste de l'occident, d'un attentisme et d'un manque d'engagement politique. Alors, je fais une comparaison, je cherche pas à dédouaner Israel, c'est juste pour comparer. Nous on envoie nos militaires en Afrique, généralement sous couvert de l'humanitaire et du terrorisme, mais souvent il s'agit, notamment lorsqu'on va en Afrique subsaharienne, de protéger nos intérêts stratégique (c'est là qu'on trouve notre uranium pour nos centrales nucléaires). On a aussi des tas de problèmes politiques en France: corruption, intérêts, etc... Qu'est qu'on fait concrètement nous en France? Pas grand chose.
Pourquoi? Parcequ'on est trop occupés: on a nos propres problèmes, on cherche du taf, une éducation, un logement, un avenir, une copine/un copain, à payer nos impôts, le crédit, etc... Je pense qu'il s'agit d'un phénomène propre à tout l'occident, le citoyen lambda laisse son gouvernement vu qu'il n'a pas la motivation/le temps d'être politiquement actif.  Alors, c'est particulièrement tragique dans le cas des US et d'Israel, moins chez nous. 

Concrètement, tu regardes la regardes l'espace politique Israélien, tu en as des alternatives pour la paix. Le bloc centriste ""l'union sioniste"", il aurait pu gagner. C'est un peu la faute des partis arabes qui ont refusé de travailler avec eux. Au final, c'est le bloc droite (Kulanu, Likud), la droite dure (Ysrael Beitenu), la droite religieuse (Shas et compagnie) et le parti colons/religieux (Habayit Yehudi) qui forment l'actuel coalition bancale. Coalition qui n'est très solide et peut (j'espère) se péter la gueule. 

Je suis pas en train de dédouaner les Israéliens de toutes leurs responsabilités, je dis juste qu'il faut pas tout mélanger et dire que les gens de Tel Aviv sont responsables de la colonisation. Pour reprendre ton image de MLP, c'est pas seulement la faute des gens qui ont voté pour elle, mais aussi ceux qui n'ont pas voté..mais quid des gens qui ont voté pour d'autres? Tu t'attends à quoi? Que l'Israélien centriste aille se battre avec les flics?

Des manifs contre la violence et la haine juif-arabe, il y en a eu ces dernières semaines, mais bizarrement, les infos n'en ont pas parlé.

- _absolut_, _voll_, _völlig_, _so richtig_ und _echt_ als anstelle von _sehr_
- _super_ anstelle von _sehr gut_ oder Ähnlichem
- _Jo_, _Joa_ und _Klar_ als Synonym von _Ja_, _Nee_ und _Näh_ für _Nein_
- Ich weiß nicht, wie sehr sowas im Deutschunterricht gemacht wird, aber eine korrekte (und regelmäßige) Verwendung von Modalpartikeln ist für mich persönlich sehr wichtig

I would describe myself as pro-mutual disarmament, and anti-unilateral disarmament, which for the moment means I support trident as an unfortunate necessity. Many have predicted that as resources in our planet grow scare, warfare will proliferate as populations grow desperate to acquire what they need to survive. This will either take the form of massive migration, or internecine conflict either between states and non-state actors, or state-on-state conflicts. These trends increases the desire to acquire nuclear weapons, as they represent a relatively cheap strategy by which to guarantee the absolute security of the nation which holds them, in comparison to a large, standing armed forces which sucks up considerable manpower and resources by comparison. Their utility in this respect has been noted by several countries and more countries have acquired nuclear weapons, against a backdrop of persistent diplomatic failures-North Korea, Iran and Saudi Arabia either possess, are developing or have announced their intention to acquire strategic nuclear forces. 

Finally, we must remember that Russia has also return the spectre of 'state-on-state' warfare in Europe, in Georgia and the Ukraine, and their continued aggressive posture against the Baltic states. This willingness to utilise unconventional and conventional forces, and their program of large-scale modernisation of nuclear weapons, has effectively enabled them to act as they please without any real reaction from the west for several years. 

As we face a future riven with conflict and uncertainty, with the threatened disintegration of the Eurozone and a possible nuclear arms race in the middle east, I feel that in the short to medium term, further unilateral disarmament is against the best interests of the UK. 

We therefore take a two pronged approach. first we should maintain our nuclear arsenal to ensure it remains competitive in the years to come, combined with investment into maritime patrol and strategic missile defence to ensure a creditable nuclear deterrent, while redoubling diplomatic efforts to prevent a further spiralling or relations, especially in the middle east where a nuclear arms race is threatening.",null,0,null,1439130798,null,null,false,0,ctwvzkl,null,t3_3gbsze,null,null,null,t1_ctwvcs5,null,null,null,1440374398,null,3,null,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

The state IS responsible for that. It has full control over the media. Even uttering the opposition's name is enough for your news channel to be taken over or your business to be investigated for tax fraud or something. The United Russia youth are the Hitler youth. The media shows fake images of dead chilldren, or images from the Syrian war or pays actors to pretend to be Ukrainians. The media continue to show biased news coverage. They label the Ukrainian rebels as   ""anti-fascists"" but call the Syrian rebels ""bandits"".  There is mass hysteria in Russia due to all this fearmongering.

C'est quel verbe qui correspond à l'adjectif verbal ""confusant"" ? Confuser ? Non, en français le verbe qui correspond à confus est confondre, et l'adjectif est confondant. Ce qui confirme d'ailleurs le calque de l'anglais (""to confuse""). Mais il n'est pas utilisé dans le sens que tu aimerais lui prêter. C'est pas un manque de mot, c'est un choix de sens, parce que les français utilisent depuis toujours une autre tournure pour exprimer la même idée (non, on n'a pas attendu 2015 pour chercher à exprimer l'idée que quelque chose prête à confusion). ""Surprenant"", lui, est attesté dans les textes depuis au moins 1544, et est probablement encore plus ancien que ça.

Il ne manque pas de mot. Le mot qui correspond à confus et confondre existe, on ne s'en est juste jamais servi pour l'usage dont on parle ici. Et si depuis le temps on ne s'en est jamais servi, c'est probablement pas parce que tous nos ancêtres étaient idiots, ou que le concept d'être confus est tout neuf et qu'on découvre seulement maintenant les bienfaits de pouvoir exprimer une telle idée, mais plus vraisemblablement parce qu'on avait un autre moyen au moins aussi efficace d'exprimer l'idée. Croire que l'anglais n'a rien à voir avec ce soudain changement d'avis, alors même qu'il s'agit d'une faute de grammaire grossière (à peu près équivalente à vouloir inventer le verbe ""consompter"" pour aller avec le nom ""consomption""), ça me paraît assez naïf.",null,0,null,1439131838,null,null,false,0,ctwwg6n,null,t3_3g8ldm,null,null,null,t1_ctwjjqn,null,null,null,1440374617,null,1,null,france,t5_2qhjz,1,null

Des sociologues comme Bourdieu et Passeron parlaient déjà de l'école comme système de reproduction des inégalités sociales dans les années 60 avec un livre intitulé ""les héritiers"", expressions reprise par Onfray (qui ne peut pas ne pas connaître au moins de nom ce gros classique de la sociologie).

C'est intellectuellement malhonnête, notamment parce qu'il ne peut pas en ignorer la critique. Donc forcément, un discours ne vaut pas un bouquin, mais là, il affirme avec aplomb du coup j'ai du mal à lui donner le bénéfice du doute.

Sur l'importance du capital et son retour, il y a aussi des trucs chez Piketty mais Onfray semble vouloir rester sur des explications simples et qui semblent centrée sur l'individu et ses mérites.

ALICE will focus on studying various aspects of [quantum chromodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics), the theory of the so-called strong force, which explains among other things how the nucleons (protons and neutrons) are bound within nuclei.

The trick is that studying such interactions requires, really, really high temperatures. This is achieved in ALICE by essentially smashing lead nuclei together at extremely high speeds to create a particle soup called a very hot [quark gluon plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark%E2%80%93gluon_plasma).

Renzi, che è ben noto per i suoi proclami, ha detto quelle parole in un contesto particolare. Era il periodo in cui stava perdendo popolarità anche a causa delle sue politiche migratorie, nel mentre Salvini stava crescendo nei consensi. La frase di Renzi era quindi solo un trucco per frenare l'emorragia. Non mi sembra infatti che siano seguiti fatti, espulsioni.

null,null,martong93,null,null,null,"Well, a lot of Warsaw pact countries suffered a lot because of the way the transition was handled in pretty much every single one of them. Obviously at a political level no one liked being fed propaganda and being under the Russian heel, but at least in economics there's a decent amount of deserved nostalgia from before the transition. Each country is different, but there were some decent parts of the socialist economy that weren't problematic that didn't necessarily need to be abandoned in the western tidal wave, and people know that the reason these things were abandoned were to serve private financial interests of politicians and western companies. So it's a bit more complicated than all Eastern Bloc countries and Ossies and such totally hate everything about the forty years they had and the transition was a godsend, in actuality the transition itself was a very difficult time for a lot of people, it's something that continues to negatively influence eastern Europe in ways that are separate from the previous forty years of communist rule, and that all these things are pretty much not understood and totally overlooked from a western perspective, in quite the dismissive sort of way typically.

Transition never really lived up to what it was supposed to be, and to say that it was a result of the forty years of mismanagement alone is a total copout and propaganda and just plain not true.

Central Europeans tend not to like either Eastern Europe or Western Europe for this reason (not that they don't like going where they get paid, but a lot of people feel like Western Europe brought a lot of woes and then go on to be snobbish and dismissive of anything relating to their experiences).

I'm saying feelings towards socialism are insanely more complex than that in people from those countries, it's just way more a a mixed bag and obviously this person is not someone who could speak for anyone from a formerly communist country and he has no right to assume he knows anything about those experiences. Education of what the communist period is actually really terrible in Western Europe and the US and Northern Europe, it's just a topic that the vast majority of people from those regions have true familiarity or meaningful exposure to. Which is still a crossover from the cold war period where (obviously) west is correct and there's no need to think about what was going on in the East. It's a lack of education that dates back to those times, although I think it should be a priority in education in Europe since it's key to understanding anything about half of the continent they're on. But as I said, it's something so ingrained in the west from the cold war that never had to be challenged. It seems Eastern Europe will forever never be worth further examination in the west because of this.

The truth is that pretty much any of the millions of people from former eastern Europe could and would all have extremely different feelings on the topic. /u/vanlynxnaarrechts has no right to claim that those millions of people feel a certain way and that way they supposedly feel supports his worldview.

In tale ambito si spiega anche la diffusione del termine: storicamente, grossi movimenti di popolazioni hanno sempre portato con sé anche fenomeni di intolleranza o razzismo più o meno larvati. Successivamente, allo stesso modo è sorta la locuzione ""terrone del nord"", generalmente per indicare gli italiani del nord-est (principalmente i veneti, detti ""boari""), che per ragioni simili cominciarono negli stessi anni ad emigrare verso il nord-ovest, venendo così accomunati agli emigranti meridionali. - wikipedia",null,0,null,1439135290,null,null,false,0,ctwy25d,null,t3_3gauvc,null,null,null,t1_ctws74y,null,null,null,1440375375,null,6,null,italy,t5_2qkhk,6,null

null,null,Noname_Poster,null,null,null,"&gt; No. You found a specific ancient map of specific time that conforms to your bias. Its absurd. I showed you a map of Russian Empire that has no Georgia at all, so lets go with that map because i like it. See how stupid it is?

No it's not stupid. I've already shown you the map that shows independent Georgia did indeed exist before annexation by the Russian Empire. It's not like that Georgians migrated to the Russian Empire and then demanded independence of lands they settled.

http://conflicts.rem33.com/images/Georgia/geor_1810.JPG

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_within_the_Russian_Empire

But you can't find a single reliable map, either western or Russian, that shows independent South Ossetia before being annexed by Georgia. You don't even bother to read the book I've advised to understand the emergence of South Ossetia. Why bother learning history when you can easily invent and post the facts that suit you? Ossetians migrated to the South Caucasus in the 13th-14th century and became subjects of the Georgian nobility and kings just like Turks migrated to Germany in the 20th century and became citizens of Germany, instead of declaring the areas they settled as part of Turkey.

I even showed you a genuine Russian map of the Caucasus, published in the 19th century, which also shows that actual independent Ossetia was limited to the North Caucasus.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Map_Caucasus_War_%281809-1817%29_by_Anosov.jpg

Since I'm Russian, I'm in no way biased against Ossetians or for that matter even against Georgians or Ukrainians. I just know the history of the Caucasus.

&gt; Then you know many idiots. You have Georgians publicly stating what they are doing and video footage of massive bombardment of Tshinkvali.

I've never denied that Georgians bombed Tskhinvali. But the Georgians weren't the first one to bomb the enemy. I've even showed you Russian video where the Russian peacekeepers say themselves that Ossetians broke the ceasefire and continued firing.

&gt;  Have you seen videos of Georgian mlrs's bombarding Tshinkvali? Were those made by Russians before war as well?

Yes, I have seen them. 

In real life, I can easily spit in your face and my friend can record the moment when you hit me back. Then I and my friend can easily accuse you of unprovoked assault on me. See how the Kremlin's plan worked? 

&gt; De jure means that they follow Georgian laws. They dont.

You don't understand the difference between de jure and de facto. I've already showed you the official Russian map from 2005 that shows that the territory of South Ossetia de jure belonged to Georgia, even according to Russia. Currently Ukraine can't control the territories de facto controlled by Donetsk and Lugansk People's republics, but does that mean that the territories of DPR and LPR are not internationally recognized as de jure Ukrainian territories? 

&gt; There were constant skirmishes from both sides and considering Georgia prepositioned its entire military before the attack we can suspect what their goal was. And that goal was publicly stated by Shakashvili and his generals.

Nope, Saakashvili sent troops after Georgian villages were being shellled for a whole night since 6 August. Minor skirmishes were between Georgian and Ossetian servicemen using small-arms fire, while I've already showed to you that in early August South Ossetians started shelling Georgian civilians with heavy artillery. 

See page pages 94-95 where Russian researcher says that South Ossetia **first** shelled the Georgians: https://books.google.com/books?id=rMST94dSPTUC

Besides Georgia had the right to attack the separatists, especially after when the latter broke the ceasefire. Georgia has never attacked Russia. Don't mention Kosovo anymore, I've already said that I didn't support this.

&gt; The title literally states he was a peacekeeper.

Now you can understand Russian? The title states so, because Medvedev called the Russian invasion of Georgia a ""peacekeeping operation"". However, according to the agreements, Russia was only allowed to station about 1000 peacekeepers in South Ossetia and did not have the right to exceed this number. This number was already reached in May 2008 and next rotation of the peacekepeers would happen within six months from May 2008.

&gt; That is very specific and there is no collaborative information on that. Also that info is suppose to have come from Russian tanker that got killed in Gori region on August 12th. 

Maybe he was blown up by mine near Gori or was deadly wounded in earlier battle. He sent SMSes while he was alive and his close relative or friend later showed SMS messages to the Russian journalist. You can send any SMS to your friend and he/she will store it for years and after you die, he/she can easily show them to someone. You don't understand how texting works?

&gt; You know these are all unverified claims? None of these were substantiated by any independent source. And to top it off even Georgia never claimed they were fighting Russian invasion when they launched their attack.

Wait, the Russian soldiers themselves participated in the war and they would know better when they entered South Ossetia. Why would they just make up false story? 

I've already shown the source published by the state TV **at 20:16 on 7 August** where Abkhazia's president clearly states that South Ossetia's president told him that a battalion from the North Caucasus District already entered South Ossetia. http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=199443 South Ossetia's president, who was Russia's ally, would know better about such movement of the troops. Or were Bagapsh and Kokoity biased against Russia and just made up false fact to discredit Russia?
Both Moscow and Georgia were located in the same time zone in 2008. 

&gt; ""Я говорил с президентом Южной Осетии. Там сейчас более-менее стабилизировано. Туда вошел батальон Северо-Кавказского округа. Все вооруженные силы привести в боевую готовность"", - распорядился Сергей Багапш, президент Абхазии. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia-24

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Caucasus_Military_District

Americans say that Georgians told them they were fighting the Russians.

&gt; Im fan of no one. Titling a book ""Putins war"" is huge indication that its biased. No objective book would be titled in a way that demonizes someone from get go.

I see that you wouldn't read a book on World War II because it's titled ""Hitler's War"".

&gt; Exactly what happened in Kosovo. US made sure it will happen elsewhere as well.

Nope, that didn't happen with the Bangsamoro Republik merely two years ago, in 2013.

&gt; Read up on how propaganda works.

Having lived most of my life in Russia, I understand perfectly well how propaganda works. 

&gt; You are delusional. Id say you have no idea how geopolitics work. You also go out of your way to misquote your own links in order to further your own narrative of Putin = bad.

This is not about geopolitics. You openly justify unacceptable behavior by larger states, while I don't. So let's allow Serbia to bully Slovenia. I'm pretty sure you will accept this and won't complain. While I approved of Putin a decade ago, I currently believe that his policy is dangerous for Russia.

You literally discard every reliable source, even Russian ones that contradict your very biased anti-American narrative. You can't even learn how to spell 'Saakashvili'. You only cherry-pick those sources that suit your narrative and don't listen to the opposing views.

null,null,Sampo,FINL,New Jersey,null,"&gt; Don't the environmental problems we've caused come precisely from the fact that we've tried to make agriculture efficient?

Conventional agriculture (with fertilizers and machines) produces lots of food, and relatively cheap food. To produce the same amount of food with organic farming would need even more land area (cut down even more forests) and the food would be more expensive.

You seem to take the eco-fascist viewpoint, that the problem is that we have so much cheap food that we can feed 7 billion people, and that it would be better if a couple of billion would starve to death instead?
 
&gt; The world is hugely over-populated. Isn't that the core of the problem?

Current estimates on population growth (google Hans Rosling) say that as education and healthcare proceed also in developing countries, women have started to have less children, and human population should peak at 12-13 billion, and then start to decrease. So we are already seeing the end of the population growth in the horizon.

If we can just feed that amount of people (and we can, with modern technology, it we use it efficiently) for a while, we can solve the population crisis without deeding to purposefully starve billions of people.

Won't help them. The UK will not give in to greece demands, that would only fuel their own euro-sceptic fire.

The IMF can't just keep putting money into greece when there are nations in much more dire situations around the globe who will demand the same aid next. So, despite what its former socialist head wants, the IMF has limits too.

If the crisis tought me one thing, the moment germany shows a little dominance on the world stage, the ghosts of world wars past are getting ressurected to bully her into submission via public shaming.

It is a no win situtation and if being evil means not being on the line for other nations debts, then so be it.

They are not doing so because it hurts Armenia. Armenia's military is stronger than ever and it's getting more Iskander missiles (even if it has to take loans). Aliyev is taking his time because it benefits his pockets. 

For every $10 that Azerbaijan spends on offensive equipment, Armenia spends a dollar to deploy defense mechanisms. The oil prices are low, Europe is going renewable, Germany is reviving coal industry, Russia is building a gas pipeline to Turkey, Iran is re-entering the oil market, Norway is slowly becoming the ""new Russia"" when it comes to supplying Europe... all these events won't help Azerbaijan to keep its strategic and political influence. Europe will eventually force the peace. When that happens, NKR will get its independence, the surrounding territories will be returned and international peacekeepers will be placed. That is exactly what Armenians want - peace.

One thing that the history shows us is that when a government mistreats ethnic minorities for decades, they will eventually fight them to re-gain their independence. That's what we saw in Eastern Europe few decades ago and  that's what we're witnessing in Eastern Turkey.

**Montag**  
Aufgestanden, Pfannkuchen gemacht und schön gemütlich zum Frühstück True Detective angeschaut. Ich kann den Hate gegen die neue Staffel wirklich nicht verstehen...

**Dienstag**  
Früh zur Sprechstunde beim Dozenten gewesen: Hausarbeitsthema steht, auch wenn das einiges gekürzt wurde D: Danach dann noch ein wenig in die Bib, für die zweite HA, die ich noch schreiben muss, nach einem geeigneten Thema gesucht, aber nichts wirkliches gefunden...  
Abends dann mit Freunden ein wenig in ner Bar chillen bis 2 Uhr, war auf jeden Fall ein lustiger Abend.

**Mittwoch**  
Eigentlich wollte ich früh um 8 Uhr aufstehen und in die Bib gehen, da ich aber bis 2 Uhr unterwegs war und auch erst um 3 Uhr zu Hause war, hab ich das Ganze auf den Abend verschoben. Ansonsten war ich noch Joggen, was bei der Hitze aber auch extrem ungeil ist...

**Donnerstag**  
Früh in der Bib gewesen und abends auf ne Party von nem Kumpel. Ich kannte außer den Kumpel, der die Party organisiert hatte, eigentlich niemanden so richtig und bin daher alleine dahin, aber der Typ ist eine extrem guter Gastgeber und hat mich ein paar Chicks vorgestellt. Folglich war ich dann nicht so alleine, wie ich anfangs gedacht hatte, und irgendwann war ich sogar noch mit einer am Rummachen, allerdings wollte sie dann irgendwann nicht mehr, aus Gründen, die ich bis heute noch nicht wirklich verstanden habe, nicht weiter machen und am Ende bin ich dann doch wieder alleine. Wenigstens weiß ich jetzt, wie sich /u/dyonisos911 letzte Woche gefühlt hat lol

**Freitag**  
Ich war zwar bis 2 Uhr unterwegs, bin aber trotzdem früh um 7 Uhr topfit aufgestanden. Daher ging es dann auch schon um kurz nach 8 Uhr in die Bib und musste sogar bis 8.30 Uhr warten, dass die Bib endlich aufmacht. Am Abend war ich allerdings auch schon krass fertig, so dass ich bereits um 22 Uhr ins Bett bin und geschlafen hab.

Except trying to view things as isolated instances with no connection has absolutely no basis in reality. And that's not even with me challenging the truthfulness or not of those statements(eg. Muslim fundies making up the majority).

The fact that you're saying ""Islam is a problem"" as if Christian, Buddhist, Secular, Nationalist etc. terrorism isn't a thing is just ridiculous. When you create a giant fucking power vacuum in a poor as fuck region you're going to have a lot of extremism, in this case it was Islamic fundamentalism. Trying to then view the rest of the world as isolated from this situation is pure idealism. 

There are two things which create extremism; 

1. Injustice
2. Inequality

*Religion* no matter what the religion is, doesn't do it. It's not magic. If that was the case all 1.3 billion Muslims would be running around with AK-47s and attacking every non-Muslim in sight and would've been for as long as Islam existed.

But, democracies are slower to action; they take a long time to get going but once they do, it's not possible to stop them from going to war.

Only a dictatorship can do what Putin is doing; which is to vary the intensity of the attack with high precision.

A real democracy can't do that. Politicians can't turn up or down the heat, the amount of death, to serve their national interest.

However, once attacked, democracies will band together and once they get going, war can't be stopped easily. Because they can't change their collective minds to stop on a whim.

If Putin was to attack he should better be sure of a quick victory because if there is a backlash (in summer) democracies can't really stop until somewhere beyond the Urals.

Plus, Russia has a great standing army, compared to Eastern European states but they don't have much of an industry.

&gt; Nachwort
&gt; 
&gt; In den vorhergehenden Kapiteln habe ich versucht, Gesichtspunkte für eine Kritik der alldeutschen Ideologie zu finden. Ich weiß, daß ich hierin nicht der Erste bin. Ich schlug der deutschen Intelligenz eine Revision ihrer Heroen vor und zeigte im deutschen Gedankenbau die verderbliche, staatspragmatisch gerichtete protestantische Filiation, als deren Hauptvertreter Luther, Hegel und Bismarck erschienen. Nochmals betonen möchte ich, daß es die Verbindung von Religion und Staat, die göttliche Sanktionierung der Autokratie, die Verwirklichung Gottes und der Idee, die Ideenverwaltung durch eine wilde Staatsautorität und das Streben nach dem militärischen »Reich Gottes auf Erden« war, was ich antichristlich, Blasphemie und Satansdienst nannte. Der Protestantismus ist eine Irrlehre, eine Irrlehre der Katholizismus, der sich auf der Erde etabliert. Gott und die Freiheit können nicht verwirklicht werden, sie sind Ideale, Staat ist ein Zustand und Zufall, von der göttlichen Idee zu durchdringen und in sie aufzulösen, nicht umgekehrt.
&gt;
&gt;Eine Vervollständigung der Kritik des theokratischen Systems der Mittelmächte würde ergeben, daß die Schuldfrage in letzter Instanz sich gegen das Papsttum richtet, als gegen das letzte Refugium militärischer Bevormundungssysteme, die auf die Gottesweihe und Gottesstellvertreterschaft sich berufen; die als Verteidiger der »heiligsten Güter Europas« auftraten, just als die Stunde ihrer Niederlage schlug, und die damit das Gewissen der Welt zu verwirren und täuschen versuchten, trotz himmelschreiender Schändlichkeiten. Die Zukunft freier deutscher Geister sehe ich in der Solidarität des europäischen Geistes gegen den theokratischen Anspruch jeder Staatsmetaphysik: nicht nur die wirtschaftlichen, sondern auch die intellektuellen Probleme verwalten zu wollen. Die wirtschaftliche Verwaltung ist einem Bund freier Völker, die intellektuelle einer Kirche freier Individuen zu überlassen. Eine Internationale produktiver Natur, eine moralische Einheit der Welt und der Menschheit sind nur möglich, wenn der protestantisch-katholische Gottes- und Despotenstaat mit seiner wirtschaftlichen Stütze, einer zuchtlosen Finanz, und seiner theologischen Stütze, dem unfehlbaren absolutistischen Papsttum, hinweggeräumt ist. Unter der Last aller Verbrechen dieses Krieges wird er zusammenbrechen. Eine Syntax freier Gottes- und Menschenrechte aber wird die demokratische Kirche der Intelligenz konstituieren, an die die Verwaltung der Heiligtümer und des Gewissens übergeht.

Ansonsten ist das Buch ein Riesen-Rant gegen fast alle: Luther, Kant, Hegel, Heine, Marx, den Papst, Bismarck... Eine Fundgrube eloquenter Beschimpfungen und eine definitiv lohnenswerte Lektüre!

My understanding of it is that because the spread was not controlled, regular crops were contaminated with GMO crops. That meant that the regular crops could not be sold because you can't mix crops and sell them (since the usual buyer of the crops would ask for specific crops, in this case, non-GMO ones to sell to people). That means that these farmers would, for example, either have to trash said crops or sell them for lower price than either only-GMO crops or non-GMO crops for generic use usually reserved for lower quality crops.

null,null,EB3031,BERL,Berlin,null,"Tjoa, unter der Woche war wieder nicht viel los, dank Semesterferien, aber am Wochende habe ich ein bißchen was übernommen. Freitagabend bin ich spontan mit Vater und Schwester ins Freilichtkino gegangen (zum ersten Mal überhaupt im Freilichtkino gewesen). War auf jeden Fall ganz nett und der Film war auch lustig. Das war ""Mr Claude und seine Töchter"", welche jeweils einen Juden, Muslim, Chinesen und Afrikaner geheiratet haben, was den konservativen katholischen Eltern zunächst ein Dorn im Auge war, ist natürlich mit glücklichem Ende ausgegangen. Danach habe ich noch (auf der Couch) bei einem Freund genächtigt, da ich Samstagmorgen sowieso wieder zu meinem Vater zum Früstücken gefahren bin und keinen Bock hatte, nur um kurz zu pennen, nachhause zu fahren. 

Dann bin ich Samstag beim Chillen mit ein paar Freunden am Havelufer in einen Nahkampf mit einem Wespenmob geraten, wir haben gewonnen. Ich habe da auch die neue Freundin (in spe) von meinem Kumpel kennengelernt, sie scheint ganz nett und aufgeschlossen zu sein, aber abends wurde das ganze noch recht ulkig. Da waren wir nämlich mit ungefähr 15 Leuten in einer Bar/Kneipe, wo gut gepichelt wurde. Da ich mich immer noch in der Suffsommerpause befinde, konnte ich ganz gut beobachten, wie circa acht Mischen auf jemanden wirken. Zu Folgendem wollte ich mal eins, zwei Gehirne anzapfen, also ist Feedback willkommen. Die neue Freundin von Freund Eins war, genau wie Freund Zwei, ziemlich dicht und hat, als Freund Eins circa 15 Minuten auf Toilette war, ungefähr 40 Euro von Freund Zwei in  ihren BH gesteckt und wollte sie nicht wieder rausrücken, das ganze war aber erstmal als humoristische Einlage zu interpretieren. Freund Zwei hat natürlich ein wenig zurückgeflachst und gefragt, wie er denn das Geld zurückbekommen könne (aber nicht mit so notgeiler Unternote, wie das jetzt klingt). Irgendwann hat sie's ihm dann zurückgegeben, als Freund Eins auch schon wieder da war. Der beflirtete Freund hat mir später erzählt, daß sie fortan sagte, daß dies ein Test war, um rauszufinden, wer Freund Eins' wahre Freunde sind. Wie gesagt, die Dame haben wir gestern erst kennengelernt und ihr Freund kennt sie auch noch nicht so lange. Freund Eins ist mit uns seit circa sechs Jahren sehr gut befreundet, Freund Zwei ist schon seit circa neun Jahren ein guter Freund von mir. Ist es normal, daß ihr Verhalten mich ärgert, obwohl ich gar nicht direkt involviert war? Ich halte das jetzt gar nicht explizit gegen sie, denn sie war eh blau, aber das Verhalten finde ich gar nicht gut. Was haltet ihr von solchen ""Fallen""? Freund Zwei fand's jedenfalls auch nicht gut und war sehr verärgert, als er mich mitten in der Nacht nochmal angerufen hat.

null,null,martong93,null,null,null,"I feel like I need to repeat this a million times before people finally get it, I AM NOT DEFENDING OR DIMINISHING ALL THE TRAGEDIES THAT OCCURRED IN THAT TIME PERIOD. What I'm trying to do is bring attention to history and historical complexity that many people are largely unaware of and that does not get received with as much relative attention as it deserves, it's fundamentally tied to the experience of the time and the people.

In the Eastern Bloc there really was no such thing as homelessness or unemployment from before the transition. Does this fact take away from all the other forms of suffering? No it of course does not. Does understanding the modern impacts of this take away from the lessons of those tragedies and the time? Not if you have any intellectual respect and appreciation for the study of history.

Many Easterners didn't want the transition to happen the way it did. The neolibaralist fervor that was happening in the west under the likes of Thatcher, Reagan, and Kohl did not exist in the east, and most westerners mistakenly believe that the sudden wave of privatization and decrease in protectionism in the East that happened during the transition was part of the same economic-political experience that was ongoing in the west that they were experiencing.

East Germans by large wanted to liberalize politically and personal freedom wise, but most wanted that to be integrated into the existing economic framework. What happened instead was the existing economic foundations, which was not at all totally and utterly useless or broken, was completely replaced very suddenly and the reason for that was because it served private interests. This is a big reason why Eastern Europe is still behind, it's not to diminish the fact that forty years of mismanagement did occur, but to put all the blame of how Eastern Europe is the way it is today entirely on the communist period and not include the time period was the transition point to what it is today is entirely revisionist.

Many perfect functioning government sectors were privatized, and that is something that brought a huge amount of suffering for Eastern Europeans. Was every government sector functioning totally well? No it wasn't. Does that mean that everything that did get privatized should have been privatized? No of course not either. It made a lot of people billionaires and filthy rich, but was worse of for national economic health and growth and the personal well-being of citizens. That's just something that in no way could be blamed on the previous communist management of these countries.

So to reiterate, there was some things that can be missed about the good ol' communist days, utilities were much less expensive, education was arguably better in many cases, and inequality was nowhere near what it was today (and not just because of the old tired trope of ""but everyone was poor""). These are perfectly legitimate things that directly impact people's lives to feel strongly about. It's not from propaganda, but direct experience with a new type of suffering that honestly just did not exist in the old system. Does that mean there was less suffering in other ways? Sure, but does that mean that it justifies having to go through this new type of suffering, or that it was necessary? Not at all.

Hence why I like to point out that among the millions of people who lived in Eastern Europe, there are millions of different and personal ways to feel about what happened.

Yeah I know that people suffered greatly under communism. People also suffered in totally new ways they or their parents never suffered before directly because of the way the collapse of communism happened and the new system that took over. I'm not saying put them on a scale of suffering and make the heavier side the eviler one or the ""wrong"" one, what I'm saying is that you can acknowledge all suffering without making it about politics or ideology. If you do not want to accept that changing to western economic ideas didn't create suffering that is worth acknowledging, then I think you're not truly intellectually curious about history, but rather about ideology of some sorts.

For modern Eastern Europe, abandoning so much of what they had beforehand *was* a mistake. There's no need for false dichotomies of Communism versus the West here. Eastern Europe would have been better off with something in between. Saying that everything about communism was just objectively and wholly bad is utterly dismissive of the experiences of the millions of people who lived through it.

Just to leave on another note. I am not defending all the bad things that happened as well because of communism, but I sure am also attacking all the bad things that happened not because of communism. My family was extremely active in fighting that system. Right now the fight that exists in Eastern Europe for a better society and better lives for people are much more so to be blamed on western economic ideas being used to further a corrupt system. Thirty years ago it was communist ideas being used to further a corrupt system. The ideas that westerners so embrace about why Eastern Europe is the way it is today are a huge part of allowing all this corruption to be validated. There are some ways that Eastern Europe is dysfunctional that it wasn't during communism. There's nothing wrong with wanting back functionality that at one time worked. You should ideally be able to pick and choose the best of any system. That's tragically not what happened.

As you said, ideology is a tool to help create more suffering. Well saying that Eastern Europe owes all it's problems to communism and that communism was nothing but evil is exactly the kind of prevailing ideological mistruths being used today to create more suffering.",null,0,null,1439141983,null,null,1439142550,0,ctx1ldr,null,t3_3gc6wo,null,null,null,t1_ctwyyai,null,null,null,1440377041,null,6,null,europe,t5_2qh4j,6,null

null,null,eurodditor,Normandie,Normandie,null,"Ben non, puisque ""fâcheux"" existe et est une des nuances disponibles. 

Pis si tu vas par là, parmi les nuances sous forme d'adjectif, y a aussi fastidieux... du coup je te conseille d'inventer le verbe fastidier pour faire bonne mesure (dont la définition serait ""rendre fastidieux"").  Et puis y a raseur, qui a un verbe qui correspond (raser) mais qui ne veut pas dire la même chose... du coup on devrait peut-être inventer raseurer (mais là je sais pas trop si la définition serait ""rendre raseur"" ou ""être raseur""). 

Bref, non, je ne crois pas que chaque verbe doit avoir un nom et un adjectif qui lui corresponde, et vice-versa. Maintenant à la limite, pour fâchant, ça a au moins le mérite de reposer sur une dérivation normale : le participe présent adjectival. C'est un classique de la langue française. 

Le problème de confusant, c'est que c'est un faux participe présent adjectival. Ca a l'odeur d'un participe présent, ca a le goût d'un participe présent, ça a l'aspect d'un participe présent, mais le participe présent de confondre n'est pas confusant. L'adjectif en -ant qui correspond à confus, je me répète, mais c'est ""confondant"", car le verbe qui correspond, c'est ""confondre"" (d'ailleurs je me suis trompé, ça a bien eu le sens de ""confuser"", c'est juste que l'usage est tombé en désuétude il y a longtemps).

Mais dire que c'est quelque chose d'inutile, ou que ça vient rajouter de la complexité (par l'ajout d'une étrange exception) à une langue déjà éminemment complexe, ou encore que l'unique raison pour laquelle les gens se retrouvent à l'utiliser spontanément c'est parce qu'ils se mettent petit à petit à ""penser en anglais"", ce sont des remarques factuelles.

Tiens, un autre néologisme qui m'énerve, c'est ""gourmand"" utilisé au sens ""ça a l'air bon"" ou ""ça a bon goût""... on l'entend tout le temps dans les émissions style Masterchef ""ohlalah, c'est réussi ce dessert, c'est beau, c'est gourmand, c'est original...""

When I was younger, I had that romantic idea of soldiers as heroes (thanks Hollywood!) and I even wanted to become one when I grow up. Naturally, I ended up signing up to an airsoft 'club' (at the time airosft was still not a thing in Bulgaria, we were a bunch of weirdos shooting at each-other with spring powered cheap chinese toys but soon after we got hold of fully automatic / gas powered airsoft weapons). It took only a couple of games to realize how worthless my life is on a battlefield, even a simulated one with guns having reliable range only up to 50 meters. I know I'm probably saying something obvious but you need to experience it. Hearing it from someone and *knowing* it is not the same as having felt it. 

So with that in mind, I don't want war. I don't want my friends and my male family members dying over bullshit. I'd be against war, always. The only way I'd go to war is if the Russians started doing what the nazis were doing in WW2. I doubt they would, tho.

Die Jungs diese Woche so oft es ging zu Soft-Play-Spielplätzen mitgenommen. Sie stehen noch sehr wackelig, da sollen sie üben können, ohne sich Beulen zu holen. Eine gute Freundin von uns hat gerade Schulferien (sie ist Schulleiterin), wir beide haben das Volk am Mittwoche mit zum Schwimmen genommen. Wie immer ein voller Erfolg. Außerdem am Dienstag den ersten Vormittag bei der Tagesmutter verbracht, 2 sehr fröhliche und kuschelige Kinder zurückbekommen. Heute haben wir dann eine Ausflug zum örtlichen Zoo in Linton gemacht. Zwar nicht zu vergleichen mit dem Kölner Zoo, aber sehr sympathisch. Ein alter, gewachsener Tierpark, mit viel Rasen zum Laufe, überall schattige Bäume neben den Pfaden, liebevoll gemacht. Es gab Riesenkaninchen und Schlangen zum anfassen, die ""großen Miezekatzen"" (= Löwen) fanden die Jungs einfach super. Und mein Mann und ich hatten einfach einen sehr entspannten Sonntag. Demnächst eventuell mal zum örtlichen Safari-Park. 

Dienstag morgen dann noch mir das neueste Venture meiner besten Freundin angeschaut, ich soll mitmachen und denken das kann was werden. Wäre schön, mal wieder mein Gehirn gebrauchen zu können - wenn die Zeit dafür bleibt. 

Nächste Woche ist voll mit Terminen zum Impfen und Vorsorge, die Jungs feiern am Freitag ihren 1. Geburtstag. Ich glaube ich werd mir an dem Tag ein großes Glas Ricard eingiessen, und dem Herngott danken, dass wir noch am Leben sind.

Das Sprechen fällt den meisten schwer am Anfang und das bedarf auch viel Übung. Mit der Zeit wirst du dich reinfinden und kaum noch Probleme haben. Dabei hilft es, wenn du ein Talent für Sprachen hast und Englisch kannst. Einige Begriffe kannst du dir so und aus dem Kontext ableiten und leichter Konversationen führen. 

Ich denke es ist falsch, sofort einsteigen zu wollen mit den schwierigen Dingen wie zum Beispiel einen Film gucken. Probier es mit Untertiteln oder fang kleiner an.

Auch wenn es vielleicht nicht deine Musikrichtung ist, aber versuch mal den Text von [ZAZ - Je veux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm88QAI8I5A) zu verstehen. Das sollte nicht ganz so schwer sein für A2 Niveau. Es gibt eine jährliche Kollektion von französischen Liedern, die vom Cornelsen Verlag ausgewählt wurden. Wenn du möchtest, kann ich dir eine Liste davon geben und du kannst sie dir anhören und überprüfen, wie viel du davon verstehen kannst.

in caso di (molto probabile) risposta negativa:

2. Effettuare denuncia presso AGCOM (http://www.agcom.it/299)
3. Attivare la procedura di conciliazione presso il corecom regionale

La conciliazione prevede un incontro presso la sede regionale, potrebbe venirti scomodo o non conveniente; l'operatore potrebbe contattarti il giorno prima dell'incontro presso il corecom per offrirti il rimborso evitando la conciliazione.

null,null,IMPF,null,null,null,"I'm a pretty big beginner myself(1.5 years), so this may not be the best advice, but I'll take a shot.

I would REALLY recommend listening to German. I just came back from a 6 week exchange in Germany. Towards the beginning I could understand some German my friends spoke, but really struggled to tell what was a single word, or even what it meant.

By the end of the trip I noticed that after asking some questions about words I didn't know and hearing all of those words quite a bit in plain conversation that I could actually hear them speak; it didn't sound like complete gibberish anymore and I could sort of grasp what people were trying to say.

I still did reading, but hearing really helped me out in distinguishing whether something was a single word and using my other vocabulary and context to find the meaning myself. If I couldn't understand the word then I would look it up, find the meaning and practice with examples in my head. From there I would think about how I could use it in different sentences.

It really got me thinking about the language, and it was more interesting than just reading a piece of paper.

One thing you'll need is a base of the language. I think knowing all of the conjugations and commonly spoken verbs and words is really important to be able to piece together what people are talking about when speaking German.

For the beginning, I would recommended reading and understanding a base of how German works. You'll see how words are spelled, and later when it comes to listening, be able to tell how they are spelled without seeing them.

Sorry if this doesn't really make sense, but this is the road I took and I think my hearing of German, and just my speaking and writing skills has also really improved by taking this path.

null,null,jackthereader,null,null,null,"I have been involved in some high energy physics project. So here is my answer. 
These are onion-detector, particles are crossing each layer, giving information about what happened in the center. a part of detector is used to get an accurate tracking the other part to get an accurate measurement of the energy (Actually ALICE measures collision more complex than the standard collision measured at LHC so the structure might be even different) 

In such a detector you have 2 types of physicist involved : The one who specialised on a given subsystem (How do you tune/troubleshoot etc... a given sub-detector) and the one who do physics analysis of the global data (If I have this number of particles with this energy it means that...) However, people can switch from one role to another (it's common to start a Ph.D thesis with a technical part, such as the calibration of a sub-detector before switching to physics analysis). So all the people have a ""basic"" knowledge of all the detector (They know about a leak in a given system and why it's important). But only expert of a given system can talk you during hours and hours about the performances of a given electronic card, and the artefacts caused by the cable near a given detector (Not kidding, a friend of mine studied the effect of the glue layer (yes the glue used to put two parts together) on a LHC experiment)

Sigh. Ancient maps are completely irrelevant. We use modern maps for a fucking reason. And while Russia and world did recognise Georgias rule over those area, Georgia never had control over them - in context of modern recognition of borders.
&gt;Since I'm Russian, I'm in no way biased against Ossetians or for that matter even against Georgians or Ukrainians. I just know the history of the Caucasus.

I seriously doubt you are Russian. You swallow pretty much any crap that is created by west, as long as its anti Russian. And you do it without an ounce of critical thinking.
&gt;I've even showed you Russian video where the Russian peacekeepers say themselves that Ossetians broke the ceasefire and continued firing.

Do you understand these words: ""unilaterally declared ceasefire""?
&gt;In real life, I can easily spit in your face and my friend can record the moment when you hit me back. Then I and my friend can easily accuse you of unprovoked assault on me. See how the Kremlin's plan worked?

So Kremlin planned for full fledged military assault by Georgians? And Kremlin wrote a speech for Shakashvili when he declared he will bring back those regions? And Kremlin set up Georgian budget so they spent freaking 8% of GDP on military?
&gt;You don't understand the difference between de jure and de facto

Ill concede that. Made wrong interpretation.
&gt;Nope, Saakashvili sent troops after Georgian villages were being shellled for a whole night since 6 August.

Everything i read about it its described as exchange of artillery. Ill concede that it is possible that there might have been a peak at which exchange was larger than before. Georgia escalated that on next day into insane levels that prompted Russian response.
&gt;See page pages 94-95 where Russian researcher says that South Ossetia first shelled the Georgians: https://books.google.com/books?id=rMST94dSPTUC[4]

Considering i cant see full page... that is literally out of context quote.
&gt; Don't mention Kosovo anymore, I've already said that I didn't support this.

Unfortunately your support is irrelevant. International politics work by precedents. US worked hard to get a foothold in Georgia and remove Russian influence from the region. That was against Russian interests so they seized the moment when Shakashvili delivered.
&gt;Now you can understand Russian?

Google translate. It sucks for understanding text in context though.
&gt;The title states so, because Medvedev called the Russian invasion of Georgia a ""peacekeeping operation"".

Or maybe he was stationed there as a peacekeeper?
&gt;Maybe he was blown up by mine near Gori or was deadly wounded in earlier battle. He sent SMSes while he was alive and his close relative or friend later showed SMS messages to the Russian journalist. You can send any SMS to your friend and he/she will store it for years and after you die, he/she can easily show them to someone. You don't understand how texting works?

I know very well how sms's work. I also know not to trust unsubstantiated claims, especially when they go into such detail and i cant find anything collaborating their story.
&gt;Wait, the Russian soldiers themselves participated in the war and they would know better when they entered South Ossetia. Why would they just make up false story?

Im perfectly willing to believe that Russia participated in exchanges of fire... in a limited way (like in Ukraine). However i prefer having real conformation of that. And i already know that volunteers (iirc 300-500 of them) came from N. Ossetia days before the Georgian invasion.
&gt;I've already shown the source published by the state TV at 20:16 on 7 August where Abkhazia's president clearly states that South Ossetia's president told him that a battalion from the North Caucasus District already entered South Ossetia. http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=199443[5] South Ossetia's president, who was Russia's ally, would know better about such movement of the troops. Or were Bagapsh and Kokoity biased against Russia and just made up false fact to discredit Russia? Both Moscow and Georgia were located in the same time zone in 2008.

Its very likely the reference to battalion was about volunteers from North Ossetia. Nothing indicates it was Russian troops. And again for the nth time... Georgia NEVER stated that they are engaging invading Russian forces. Not once. And they were bombarding freaking Tshinkvali, not Roki tunnel. Until 1 day later when Russians actually came. Then it was non stop whining by Shakashvili.
&gt;Americans say that Georgians told them they were fighting the Russians.

Just look at reporting from 7th when Georgia launched an attack and when Russia actually sent tanks through Roki. Its day and night difference. First it was casual accusations and then absolute panic reporting. You could freaking feel the panic in Georgian government. You could see it in Shakashvilis eyes when he realised the Russians are actually coming. He went from his bravado posturing into tie eating in a flash.
&gt;I see that you wouldn't read a book on World War II because it's titled ""Hitler's War"".

You are correct.
&gt;Nope, that didn't happen with the Bangsamoro Republik merely two years ago, in 2013.

You dont understand how it works. Kosovo scenario happens when powerful states decide its in their interest for it to happen. Shakashvili delivered it on silver plate.
&gt;Having lived most of my life in Russia, I understand perfectly well how propaganda works.

That statement alone tells me you have no clue what you are talking about. And the fact you presented that shitty video as proof of anything confirms it. Start here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JEvxOdMWOU It also explains why i wouldnt read a book titled ""Hitlers war"".
&gt;While I approved of Putin a decade ago, I currently believe that his policy is dangerous for Russia.

I agree somewhat. Just on his internal policy.
&gt;You can't even learn how to spell 'Saakashvili'.
