This is done all the time in America with respect to black people. ""I don't hate black people, I hate *black culture*"" is nothing more than to excuse the racist sentiments that one harbors by presenting them in a more socially acceptable manner. [See statement highest on both 'bravery' and 'certainty' axes.](http://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/G-W-fesDNEPOdjLZ.png) Typically what they mean by 'black culture' is hip-hop, urban poverty, crime, glorification of criminal behavior, a distinct dialect that is perceived as inferior (by ignorant people), and so on. The obvious problem is that these things are by no means representative of black people, and hence cannot be described as 'black culture'—that bridge is only drawn because of the racist assumptions of the person using the term. It's even worse than that, as these people are usually terrifically ignorant of the the 'negative' things they're pointing to, e.g. hip-hop or the cultural dynamics of urban ghettos.

of course this is talking about ancestry not identity. The two aren't always different though. I think the notable thing is the large swath of beige through Tennessee and Kentucky that declare their ancestry as 'American'.

---

&gt;

&gt;The __Antiqua–Fraktur dispute__ was a [typographical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography) dispute in 19th- and early 20th-century [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany).

&gt;In most [European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) countries, [blackletter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackletter) [typefaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface) like the German [Fraktur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraktur_(typeface\)) were displaced with the creation of the [Antiqua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiqua_(typeface_class\)) typefaces in the 15th and 16th centuries. However, in Germany, both typefaces coexisted until the first half of the 20th century.

&gt;During that time, both typefaces gained [ideological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology) connotations in Germany, which led to long and heated disputes on what was the ""correct"" typeface to use. The eventual outcome was that the Antiqua-type fonts won, when the [National Socialist government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party) chose to phase out the more ornate-looking Fraktur.

I'm not 100% sure how it emerged, but I imagine it has something to do with groups of Irish people being made itinerant and then grouping together to form little insular itinerant communities which then travelled around from town to town begging and doing odd jobs. In Ireland, they're known as ""Tinkers"", literally because they were known for being accomplished tinsmiths. When these trades died out, they got involved in crime and general nuisance behaviour. 

&gt; I just don't understand how the nomadic idea became so entangled with Irishness.

Well, it hasn't really. There's nothing necessarily Irish about a nomadic lifestyle, but Irish Travellers are still Irish regardless because they're Irish by blood and their particular way of life and customs evolved in Ireland.

When learning a second language, you'll only benefit from immersion if you can pretty much understand most of the things people say. Imersion helps you learn *Umgangsspreche*, idioms, figures of speech, develop your accent, learn a few more complex/vivid vocabulary words, familiarize yourself with recognizing German humor/puns, etc. to become a better speaker. 

Have a conversation with a native speaker in your home country, be it in person or on skype with a redditor. If you genuinely feel confident and could understand majority of what they were saying (in an actual meaningful conversation, not just simple *""Wie geht es Ihnen""*, etc.) or read an online article from a German newspaper and comprehend it, then sure, you're probably ready. 

Don't jump the gun on it, because if you go to Germany and aren't truly ready, you're gonna have a bad time. You'll be so overwhelmed that you'll be miserable. Sure, enough people speak English, but it just is not the same as America/UK/Australia/South Africa/Canada/Wherever you're from. I have visited Spain before, knowing no Spanish. A lot of people spoke English but I really just felt out of place not having a full grasp of their language. I plan to go to Germany in about a year because I have been studying very hard, and I set a reasonable goal for myself which is surely attainable if my progress continues at the rate it has been for the past 4 years.

Modern cryptographic algorithms are strongly believed to be unbreakable at our current level of technology. There are a few known methods to do it, but they are all dependant on computing power vastly beyond what our entire species has today.

There could be an unknown flaw in the algorithms, since noone has actually managed to provide a mathematic proof that there isn't. This is considered extremely unlikely, but NSA, FSB, and whatever the chinese version is, are certainly looking for it. They all happily use the same cryptomethods as everyone else, so it's a pretty safe bet that they haven't found anything, and don't expect to in the near future.

Getting the crypto keys is really the only plausible way they could have decrypted the files. This would only require old fashioned spy work like bribes, extortion or hacking.

The acoustic cryptanalysis featured in the link above has been demonstrated using a cellphone. The intelligence agencies can certainly replicate that, and likely do it better. It would potentially only take one of the journalists forgetting his phone in his pocket to get at the keys.

Indeed and you pretended that this wasn't the case and included the census jobs in your numbers most likely because you actually have no clue what that spike in 2010 actually was. At least you have given up on claiming that they did austerity as a solution to the recession. 

You are also not aware that the US is a federation. Teachers for example are not employed by the federal government, but by states.

&gt;Census jobs has nothing to do with the reduction.

If you hadn't included them that would be true. But your number clearly includes the census jobs. 

&gt;Also this is great for the US economy with less and less government workers especially since this will mean more fiscal stability for them in the future.

Uh no. The US is designed as an insurance company with an army. They have to either cur medicare/medicate/pensions or reduce defense spending or both. A few fewer teacher will just lead to more people like you. But, for the fiscal outlook it's nothing more than a drop in the ocean.

But you completely ignore the actual discussion, which was that austerity in a recession is bad policy. Both the US and Germany acted the way I said was correct and succeded.

[Laut Robert-Koch-Institut](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/Antibiotikaresistenz/LA_MRSA_und_ESBL.html)

&gt;LA-MRSA sind als asymptomatische Besiedler weit verbreitet, besitzen offenbar die gleiche Pathopotenz wie S. aureus und können die gleichen vielgestaltigen Krankheitsbilder verursachen (Witte et al., 2007).Außerhalb der Krankenhäuser sind es überwiegend tiefgehende Haut-Weichgewebeinfektionen, die einer chirurgischen Behandlung bedürfen (van Cleef et al., 2011, b) und betreffen vorwiegend Personen mit direkter beruflicher Exposition, gelegentlich deren Familienangehörige. Als MRSA aus tiefgehenden Haut-Weichgewebeinfektionen, die außerhalb von Krankenhäusern auftreten, nehmen LA-MRSA dabei einen Anteil von 10 -15% ein (Cuny und Layer, 2011, Layer et al., 2013). Insgesamt betrachtet, sind diese Infektionen bisher nicht häufig. LA-MRSA können jedoch durch kolonisierte Personen in stationäre Pflegeeinrichtungen eingetragen werden und ausgehend von der asymptomatischen Besiedlung nosokomiale Infektionen verursachen, wie tiefgehende Wundinfektionen nach Hüftgelenkersatz, Lungenentzündung bei künstlich beatmeten Patienten oder Sepsis (Witte et al., 2007). [...]

null,false,Tythan,campania,,null,"Io ho collaborato per un sito emergente (e con questo intendo dire tutti ragazzi, nemmeno uno con una laurea attinente al settore giornalistico) di informazione e approfondimento videoludico per un paio d'anni.

Entrai in ""redazione"" perché mi piaceva l'idea di esprimere le mie idee e il confronto con quante più persone possibile. Mi sono divertito molto e ho dovuto lasciare la redazione per motivi di studio. 

Lavorare in questo settore è DAVVERO difficile, soprattutto senza avere una formazione adeguata alle spalle. Con questo non voglio scoraggiarti, ma come dicevano anche in altro commenti da qualche anno a questa parte a livello emergente la concorrenza è molto agguerrita (soprattutto nel settore in cui vorresti lavorare tu), e senza un'iscrizione all'Albo o ""un foglietto"" che ispiri professionalità si verrà sempre considerati come ragazzini che fanno questo lavoro per passatempo. Inutile dire che per parlare propriamente di ""lavoro"" e ""retribuzione"" questi documenti sono obbligatori. 

Tornando alla mia esperienza: noi ci autofinanziavamo, e con le pubblicità e qualche referral spesso non riuscivamo a coprire le spese del server e del dominio (lol). Il gruppo era buono, non molto unito ma comunque composto da persone molto preparate in materia. Alcuni articoli raggiungevano anche svariate migliaia di visualizzazioni e spesso con delle notizie battevamo sul tempo anche le testate maggiori a livello nazionale o europeo. I numeri erano dalla nostra parte e attirammo l'attenzione anche della maggior parte dei publisher videoludici. Non ti nascondo che, sebbene le nostre visualizzazioni non fossero nemmeno un decimo di quelle dei colossi italiani, i PR ci mandavano materiale da recensire e abbiamo ricevuto svariate volte inviti stampa alle più grandi manifestazioni mondiali (se segui l'industria videoludica sto parlando anche dell'E3 e della Gamescom), ma abbiamo anche ricevuto richieste di ""dare quel mezzo voto in più in fase di recensione"" e abbiamo sentito frasette tipo ""mi raccomando, trattiamolo bene"", e forse proprio la nostra onestà non ci ha permesso di andare troppo avanti.

In base alla mia esperienza quindi, gli agganci - in Italia - servono e facendo giornalismo vero e schietto è difficile emergere. Ovviamente partirai dal basso, e con molto impegno e costanza (ma anche talento e una buona conoscenza delle lingue) potrai farti notare all'interno del gruppo e magari puntare più in alto.

Since i'll be going back to Malaysia to visit family during Ramadhan &amp; Eid, i'll be posting at least one or two Malaysian news as well.

**Personal**

So other than watching anime like **Working** and **Hibike Euphonium**, i'm also watching Parks and Recreation Season 4. I think S4 is the best season of P&amp;R, since there's something enjoyable about Leslie Knope as a character who's trying to balance between running for city council and running the P&amp;R department.

Also, **D4** is released on Steam, and while i'm also enjoying **The Witcher 3** and **Bloodborne** it's fun to see a game as stupid as D4 come out once in a while. It's by the guy who made the Twin Peaks love letter called Deadly Premonition and D4 takes the stupidity of Deadly Premonition and puts it in an episode game. It's really fun, and David Young is one hell of an enjoyable character.

People of gypsy ethnicity in Romania -who you can identify by their appearance- are outright ashamed many times to even call themselves gypsies; for them it would be shameful to dress in traditional gypsy garb since that's synonimous with this gyspy counterculture.



Because the self-identified ones like the ones you see in that video have developed this set of ways to live which involves stealing everything that isn't welded down. That includes sewer caps, railroad and cable, so the very infrastructure of the areas they reside in, just to sell. That involves sending their kids to beg or sell flowers in the streets, rather than sending them to school to get an education and to allow them to get an honest living. That also involves pickpocketing and begging in the streets. Don't get me started on what the rich gypsies do, they are worse than the flashiest rappers you can imagine.
We're talking a culture that has people checking through someone's purse and bags while others are feigning to see if they are ok after an accident, I'm too disgusted to look that video up. I dont want to mention the extreme cases of child brides and children being sold, or of cousins of really young age being wed so that the wealth doesn't go outside of the family.

People mistook and keep confusing, like you are right now, hatred for family organized criminal activity and isolationism, with people being racist.

Happily the situation is self-resolving, with kids being sent to school in the UK or in Germany, at least so that the parents can get their allowance and social benefits, and in those places government has enough funds to make sure kids actually attend school, and courts get involved if they start missing school or start doing things like stealing from other students, at least from a few examples I heard about.",null,0,null,1434266851,null,0,1434275480,0,cs5zvz7,null,t3_39qk1l,null,t1_cs5zvz7,null,t1_cs5ycou,null,null,null,1436985672,null,19,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,19,null

**""The Magna Carta""**

Your... ""advice""... makes no sense. While I'm sure you will find likeminded people I could not care less. Language rules are created by the people using the language, not by a minority who try to impose arbitrary rules.

They *try* to use just ""Magna Carta"":

http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/14/magna-carta-study-reveals-church-role

But even they have difficulty with the awkward language that results and say ""the Magna Carta"" in the caption. It just sounds HORRIBLE without ""the"". You can speak and write horrible awkward language if that makes you feel good, I certainly won't.

Und wenn du dich in der deutschen Medienlandschaft umsiehst  wirst du schnell merken das ausser der Taz niemand mehr bereit und willens ist die Schildbürgerstreiche aus Athen mitzutragen und durchzufinanzieren. 

Verlass am besten mal deine Internetblase und unterhalte dich mit deinen Mitbürgern da draußen, egal aus welchem politischen Lager, dann wirst du schnell merken wie sehr Syriza es sich mit ihrem totalen Konfrontationkurs verzockt haben. 

Letztes Jahr gab es bei vielen noch einen Hauch von Sympathie und Verständnis aber mittlerweile können die meisten Bürger den Grexit kaum noch abwarten. Ich weiß nicht wie alt du warst als der Euro aus der Taufe gehoben wurde, aber älteren Semestern wie mir ist noch gut in Erinnerung geblieben das man uns Wählern garantiert hatte das es nicht zu einer Transferunion kommen wird.

Griechenland hatte in der EZ nie etwas verloren und wäre ohne Betrug auch niemals reingekommen. Alles was hier gerade passiert ist die Korrektur dieses Geburtsfehlers des Euros. 

Ich war früher auch mal so links drauf wie viele in diesem Subreddit. Klar, warum nicht ist ja auch cool und menschlich und so. Dann bin ich irgendwann erwachsen geworden und habe gelernt das die Welt da draußen Regeln und Gesetze hat. Und eine dieser Regeln besagt das jeder Euro den du für soziale Wohltaten ausgeben willst erstmal irgendwo von irgendwem erwirtschaftet werden musste. Und wenn ein Staat wie Griechenland seine Bürger über Jahrzehnte hinweg gerne mal mit Mitte 50 in die Rente geschickt hat und sich zusätzlich noch eine Millionen Beamte auf 10 Millionen Einwohner gegönnt hat dann muss der Rest der Bevölkerung da unten halt entsprechend härter ranklotzen um das ganze zu finanzieren. Können sie gerne machen, aber bitte nicht mit meinen Steuergeldern.

So you say your kind should lawfully rob me without me being able to voice my concern once every four years? How about this: make voting an opt-out process, and link it to paying taxes - no vote, more money (or better: amount of votes equal to the actual taxes you paid last year).

You're correct on this. None of them is german. In fact, if you call a Swiss german you'll probably end up getting a very nasty response from him/her. Don’t try that at home ;-)

Of course there are people that consider e.g. Austrians german but those are part of right wing fringe groups. Race, Bloodline and things like that are unimportant when it comes to being german. It couldn’t be any other way. Just remember that roughly 20% of germans have a migrational background. That is, they or there parents have migrated to Germany after 1949. Germany is in the center of Europe. The region has been a melting pot for thousands of years even if some crazy right wingers try to deny that.

&gt; Citizenship is all that matters?

Officially yes but personally I would call knowledge of language as well as calling Germany home (whatever that is) mandatory too. So I have problems calling an american that never visited Germany, does not speak german and by sheer luck has dual citizenship german. Of course he/she officially is and I do recognize that.

TPP treaty set to destroy jobs and kill millions, both Chomsky &amp; Buchanan oppose it



TPP is set to destroy American jobs, impoverish America and kill millions in developing countries.

When people as diverse as Noam Chomsky and Pat Buchanan are virulently against it, but the bipartisan crooks in DC are pushing to Fast track it through by keeping the contents a secret and having no debate - you know it's a treaty that is not in the interests of Americans.

Ross Perot was exactly correct when he famously told America in the 1992 presidential debate “there is going to be a giant sucking sound of US jobs heading south”.
Ross Perot was talking about NAFTA.

TPP has been described as NAFTA on steroids.

TPP sets up a system where Corporations can sue local taxpayers if a government brings in any law or regulation that ""hurts Corporate profits"" (or existing laws do).

So that is any law or regulation that protects the rights or the living standards of the people over profiteering by Corporations. So pretty much anything.

The settlements are expected to run into the billions.

The treaty will make it very difficult for any country to effectively regulate or otherwise control international banks.

It allows the major pharmaceutical companies to extend their profiteering - it is set to kill millions by denying access to affordable drugs.

Copyright Law and Environmental protections become the lowest common denominator in order to boost the profits of Protectionist companies and Polluters.

Monsanto will be using the new treaty in order to prevent countries from limiting the spread of it's GMO seeds.

There are 600 Corporate lobbyists helping to draw up the treaty, including those of Monsanto and Halliburton. Representatives of the people?  Zero, zip, nada, none.

When I was there last summer we went on a fun ""free"" (ie pay as you like) tour run by an anarchist. Of course, his view of the city was very different from what you would usually get, and one of the big talking points was always hotels. Hotels that the community manages to block by buying a tiny plot of land (crowdsourcing the money) and then for example, changing the space into an urban art spot. You can see, when the people take such drastic action, that these are issues close to their hearts. Imagine seeing your community torn apart by evictions and then seeing the tourists live there instead.

Another example was Park Guell, which was made open for the people of Barcelona, but now got changed into part of the park having an entry fee. I understand the need to capitalise on tourists (especially if they're damaging the things their visiting) but it's  not as if Barcelona didn't encourage it.

That's the thing, and this is where you and I have a critical divide in our way of thinking. I care about more than my personal happiness. I've traveled the world and there's a lot more in it than just my apartment, my girlfriend, and my computer. As I said, if you don't care, that's fine, but don't try to take the moral high ground when history has already proven you wrong. Appeasement only leads to war. You don't want to find the balance between warmongering and appeasement, so you pick the less evil, but some of us (thankfully most) still care more than what's in our vision.

Also, back to living under a different flag, communism absolutely wrecked eastern Europe, as a German one would think that you'd see that. Don't give me this crap about not caring, you've been spoiled by living in a comfortable country and you've forgotten that the real world exists. 

&gt;we do not care about someone whom we never met telling us to pick up a rifle so that $bigCompany can make a few bucks more

Do you honestly think that that's what things boil down to? Have you taken any classes related to history, governance, or politics? I called you an anarchist because anarchists share your ideas. They want to live only for themselves and they don't believe in collective benefit.

*Also*, you've assumed that I give a damn about nationality. I love all Europeans, I'm just not afraid to stand up when one of my brothers thinks he has the right to begin invading another one of my brothers.

I'm very progressive on issues of immigration, but if it's one group of people I'm prejudiced against, it's the gypsies. Every population that comes in contact with them hates them.

To give you an idea of how deep seated that feeling is, in greek we call gypsies Γύφτους (direct translation of gypsies) or Ρομά.

And his Italian mother wasn't all that great either...

- Always go red.

- Yeah, several Iranians could pass Italian/European and that particularly happens for those that are considered lighter featured in Iran but darker featured in Italy. However I doubt Roman soldiers have anything to do with it since it was too small a thing to affect the gene pool in any effective way. The genetic ties to Europe go back to a much earlier period which is probably linked to Indo-European migration waves or even earlier in Prehistory.

null,false,DocTomoe,GERM,Germany,null,"&gt; I care about more than my personal happiness.

So do I - personal happiness, though, stands paramount, and I am not going to risk my personal happiness for lesser interests. 

&gt; As I said, if you don't care, that's fine, but don't try to take the moral high ground when history has already proven you wrong.

When did history proove me wrong that war is a murderous, horrible, petty thing? When ever was the life of the common man *improved* by warfare?

&gt;  Appeasement only leads to war. 

When did I ever say anything about appeasement? My position isn't appeasement, but staying the hell out of military conflicts that we cannot win and have nothing to gain from. 

Also, careful appeasement has led to seventy years of peace, which is the longest period of peace we have had in central Europe. 

&gt;  some of us (thankfully most) still care more than what's in our vision. 

1. Most of who? Europeans? Then maybe Europeans have not yet learned their lessons after centuries of warfare. Maybe then it is time for a nuclear holocaust - just try to keep those who *did* learn their lessons out of it. 

2. ""Wer Visionen hat, soll zum Arzt gehen"" - German chancellor Helmut Schmidt. (""If you have visions, you should go to a doctor/psychiatrist"").

&gt; Also, back to living under a different flag, communism absolutely wrecked eastern Europe, as a German one would think that you'd see that. 

What I see is that people still were reasonably happy in the GDR. They did not have our level of consumerism, they waited years for their cars, but they still got community, relative economic safety and - unless they actively were hostile to their rulers - personal safety as well. When I see old images, I see happy people living happy lifes with purpose, not unlike in the west. Man cannot wish for more.

Arguabely, I know very little about the situation in Hungary, ca. 1970, so I will not comment on that.

Just to be clear though, I am not a communist. Nor would I think that the remote chance of a Russian takeover would lead to a communist regime.

&gt; Don't give me this crap about not caring, you've been spoiled by living in a comfortable country and you've forgotten that the real world exists.

So would you rather see us in arms again? The last time, that didn't turn out so well for eastern Europe, and - frankly - today's situation would be a picnic compared to what we did back then.

&gt; Have you taken any classes related to history, governance, or politics?

Yes, and they are pretty good in showing that war always is fuelled by economic interests. There are no laws for territory (but for economically-exploitable natural ressources in that territory), for race or religion, there only is the big Dollar/Euro to be made. 

Of course, you can show me *one* war that was not in it's core a big raid?

&gt;  I called you an anarchist because anarchists share your ideas. They want to live only for themselves and they don't believe in collective benefit.

Actually, most people who consider themselves ""anarchists"" are leftists and communist, which are *only* about the collective benefit. What you describe is ""anarchocapitalism"", and I agree that I am relatively near their views philosophically.

&gt; I love all Europeans, I'm just not afraid to stand up when one of my brothers thinks he has the right to begin invading another one of my brothers.

So, essentially, you randomly choose a bully to follow and one to attack. How mature.

&gt; For someone who doesn't care, you seem to be awfully hell bent on convincing somebody who cares about the world to not care about the world.

The problem here is that when these people want asylum in our countries, it would be more costly to integrate them into Europe than into Tunisia. I choose Tunisia, because it's where refugees can feel safe.

We shouldn't start subsidizing foreigners now. We started that long ago, and we're living fine with it. We already have a lot of financial aid being spent everywhere on things not even related to Europe, right now, with all our unemployment. An awful lot of money is being sent to places under corrupt dictatorships, and will sure be badly spent.

Now with the figures:

EU members spent more than $70b and the institutions about $16b more in foreign aid in 2013. That's $86b, more that Algeria's annual total expenditures ($78.6b). Tunisia's budget in 2015 is only about [$16b](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/11/tunisia-budget-idUSL6N0TV16620141211); just $3.14b go to development.

Now if we redirect just a quarter of our annual foreign aid to Tunisia, about $21b, we would more than double Tunisia's budget. It would be more than enough to build a city. 

I think focusing money on one project is better than thinly spreading your money on everything. Do you think spending $2b for each country x 10 countries in Central Africa would be better than $20b on one country that is directly south of us?

With respect to the Australian method, we'd need to find a stable third party that wants to take them.  I'm not sure I can think of any candidates.  Human rights activists wouldn't like it and they'd probably still try to get to Europe. 

The situation is quite difficult because I don't see a good, humane option.  Yes, the ECHR can be a pain in the arse, but they're definitely not wrong here.  You can advocate a review of asylum policy all you want, but you need a workable alternative and therein lies the problem.

I said you were a Corporate shill on another board and you didn't even try to deny it.

Why are you working so hard to impoverish hundreds of millions of people and kill thousands (the undoubted effects of TPP, TTIP and Tafta which you are pushing so hard with disinfo)?

No normal person would post as many comments as you have trying to bolster support for TPP, TTIP and Tafta.

There are a number of Corporatist trolls working to deceive the people on Reddit. I've seen half a dozen on various boards posting disinfo on TPP, TTIP and Tafta.

It's not surprising that the Corporations are employing some trolls to manipulate social media - there are many billions to be made by the top 0.1% while impoverishing everyone else if these disastrous deals are passed.

Your comment above is clutching at straws and the feeblest of straw man arguments, trying to deflect that you are a Corporatist shill. Your feeble attempt to try and deflect from the facts is the best you can do. You are a joke. Maybe I should ring up Goldman (or the other Corporations above) and tell them their trolls are laughable, ridiculous and transparent.

The following is a link to a recruitment advert for Corporate social media trolls http://www.liveworld.com/careers/liveworld-moderator/ so people can see how social media trolls are hired to sell out their souls.

Sometimes the trolls are run out of an agency (like the one above) and don't actually know which Corporation (or politician, or lobby group) is paying their wages. They just get sent a topic and a pack of talking points and disinfo to push from the agency. It would be easy to send this on an email or something.

1. Those who's families have kept traditions, language and culture alive over time and **identify closely *with* their heritage**.

2.  The ""olive garden"" type: i.e. an American who identifies as Italian but cant point out the Amalfi coast from the Florida keys. (Olive garden is a shitty Italian restaurant chain.) in other words **identifies *as* their heritage**.

America wen't through a huge ""normalization"" period with many immigrants, **especially for the Germans**, it's actually quite sad. This started around WWI.

People bleached their cultural identities out of fear. Americanization / Anglicization of names and traditions were expected for success. The *newer* waves being bullied for being more ""foreign"" than the last wave. Many German-language newspapers stopped printing, street names changed etc.

What was left was just a cultural sheen, like eating a particular meal on a special occasions, a re-spelled last name or hand-me-down relic's from the last generation etc. 

This to an extent, this has made many modern Americans ignorant, or even prideful of their lack of knowledge of other countries, cultures and ideas, as at one point the idea that the old world was shit and America was king has trickled down over time. Some families are more pragmatic and differentiate themselves from the homogenized mob of culture-void consumers. This isn't a bad thing if done the right way.

Living in the midwest, it is pretty clear, the DE influence is here, but people are surprised when pointing it out. Many people don't care anyway. 

There are places in Wisconsin, Texas etc where people actively keep up traditions and are proud of them, teach their children the history and language and travel back, send kids to school in the EU, many may still have family in Europe they can reach if they have been diligent in not losing touch over the century. I mean, if your family name is von Reichenbach, wouldn't you want to teach your kids the lineage? 

Perhaps this is more popular among more educated (affluent?) communities to know and identify culturally on some small level with the old countries.

On the other hand there's that asshat yank who's 1/6th Irish(etc.) who tells everyone ""I'm Irish"" and knows nothing of Joyce or the Revolution but knows Guinness is black.

All I'm saying is don't judge too harshly of those who are trying not to lose a layer of identity. Sometimes its hard to be full on ""howdy"" when you speak a few languages, don't eat fast food and pay more attention to international affairs and the shitty policies we support, then 9 innings of hitting a ball with a stick and then going to the gun range.

It is all about frame height. Good bikes come in various frameheights, usually from 45 to 55 cms for womens bikes and 55 to 65 cms for mens bikes. Additionally there are some decent bikes floating around made for teenagers, so you could pick up a boy's bike with an even smaller frame. Bikes meant for children age 8-14 come with 24 inch wheels and a frame height of around 35 cms. 

I am not surprised that you had problems in Amsterdam, Dutch people are on average the tallest in the world. This is also reflected in the frame heights of Dutch bike builders. Their womens bikes tend to come in frame heights of 50+ cms, way too large for anybody under 1,65 cms or 5ft 5 in. 

I would recommend going into a bike store that can measure you for your ideal frame height - or calculate it yourself online. 

If you only want a bike that gets you from A to B within the city you can easily pick up a cheap and new teen bike in the supermarket for 70-180 EUR. I would not buy those used, because most parents tend to buy cheap and by the time the child has outgrown the bike it is often damaged and at the end of its life. 

Alternatively search for ""DDR-Klapprad"", ""Mifa Klapp"" or ""DDR Klappfahrrad"", those also have smaller frames and if treated correctly they are pretty durable. Look at both the regular ebay as well as ebay kleinanzeigen.

Best of luck to you, but I'm not spending any more time on this.

Don't get me wrong, I don't think you're Hitler, but I also don't think that you have anything valuable to add to political discourse. For example:

&gt;Of course, you can show me one war that was not in it's core a big raid?

World War 1 was motivated by the foolery of men that got high off of Bismarck's ass-fumes. World War 2 was motivated by the foolery of several nations getting high on the fumes of their burning nations, post-WW1. I swear to Christ if you blame the Jews I'm going to take a break from Reddit for a few days. Moving on, the Vietnam war was motivated by the foolery of a nation that was trying to set up an aggressive cultural and political export system through actions meant to impress/scare the international community. The military-industrial complex (which I'm actually well aware of, I've written two research papers on why it's bad) followed the beginning of the war, it didn't outright cause it.

But the causes of these wars don't matter, because we're not talking about attacking, we're talking about *defending another NATO member in the event of a Russian attack*. Not only that, we're talking about deterring Russia from doing to eastern Europe what it is doing to Ukraine, sowing discord and instigating war.

I lied earlier, I wasn't done, but now I really am. I've heard more convincing arguments from pro-Putins, and that's saying something. You're very strung up in an ideology that has no basis in reality. In the context of the original topic, you *are* preaching appeasement, and you *are* preaching the betrayal of an agreement that has kept Europe more peaceful than it ever has been. You've settled on top of morally upstanding by logically fallible ideology that requires all parties involved to be of a like mind to work. The pacifist nation will always be at the boots of its neighbors. Don't you dare bring the Swiss up, they wield a power that is ultimately much more dangerous than a border war, they're bigger wolves than any European nation and that's why nobody has attacked them for as long as our great-grandparents can remember, which would lead on to me ranting about how you've made the classic mistake of thinking that war isn't just a continuation of politics.

The creditors position for the past 5 months has been that Greece (Varoufakis and company) have failed at every turn to provide acceptable terms with the necessary technical details to support the measures they are seeking in the negotiation. Fair enough. I see this demand as an appropriate request for a valid forecast in order to make an assessment as to whether or not they think the Greek measures will work to their satisfaction. Fine.

So. Given that the original measures of the MOU were designed by the troika and given that Greece's economy has tanked even further during the 5 years of the MOU implementation, should we also be asking the Creditors to provide a detailed analysis of what went wrong? After all, it was the Troika's prescription...they should do the analysis and come back with a clear diagnosis. So far, there has been  no official position on this...just scattered comments across the media about how Greeks did not implement the prescribed measures. These accusations are not based on any analysis and certainly aren't transparent to the people. Lots bickering among the troika behind the scenes. We hear reports about the initial disagreements between the IMF and ECB as well as EU finance ministers...but no clear analysis and position on what went wrong.

Funny how they demand technical analysis for a forecast but  do absolutely nothing for a diagnosis. I would have thought a 25% drop in GDP alone would have warranted a review.

TPP treaty set to destroy jobs and kill millions, both Chomsky &amp; Buchanan oppose it



TPP is set to destroy American jobs, impoverish America and kill millions in developing countries.

When people as diverse as Noam Chomsky and Pat Buchanan are virulently against it, but the bipartisan crooks in DC are pushing to Fast track it through by keeping the contents a secret and having no debate - you know it's a treaty that is not in the interests of Americans.

Ross Perot was exactly correct when he famously told America in the 1992 presidential debate “there is going to be a giant sucking sound of US jobs heading south”.
Ross Perot was talking about NAFTA.

TPP has been described as NAFTA on steroids.

TPP sets up a system where Corporations can sue local taxpayers if a government brings in any law or regulation that ""hurts Corporate profits"" (or existing laws do).

So that is any law or regulation that protects the rights or the living standards of the people over profiteering by Corporations. So pretty much anything.

The settlements are expected to run into the billions.

The treaty will make it very difficult for any country to effectively regulate or otherwise control international banks.

It allows the major pharmaceutical companies to extend their profiteering - it is set to kill millions by denying access to affordable drugs.

Copyright Law and Environmental protections become the lowest common denominator in order to boost the profits of Protectionist companies and Polluters.

Monsanto will be using the new treaty in order to prevent countries from limiting the spread of it's GMO seeds.

There are 600 Corporate lobbyists helping to draw up the treaty, including those of Monsanto and Halliburton. Representatives of the people?  Zero, zip, nada, none.

[**Bank of England: ""Money creation in the modern
economy""**](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/2014/qb14q1prereleasemoneycreation.pdf) (PDF)

&gt; • Money creation in practice differs from some popular misconceptions — banks do not act simply
as intermediaries, lending out deposits that savers place with them, and nor do they ‘multiply up’
central bank money to create new loans and deposits.

.

&gt; In the modern economy, most money takes the form of bank
deposits. But how those bank deposits are created is often
misunderstood: the principal way is through commercial
banks making loans. **Whenever a bank makes a loan, it
simultaneously creates a matching deposit in the
borrower’s bank account, thereby creating new money.**

.

&gt; The reality of how money is created today differs from the
description found in some economics textbooks:

&gt; • Rather than banks receiving deposits when households
save and then lending them out, bank lending creates
deposits.

&gt; • In normal times, the central bank does not fix the amount
of money in circulation, nor is central bank money
‘multiplied up’ into more loans and deposits.",null,0,null,1434273050,null,0,false,0,cs61aef,null,t3_39pxdg,null,t1_cs61aef,null,t1_cs5od7p,null,null,null,1437555424,null,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1,null

That's a completely different metric from competitiveness. Gross wages are the best estimator of per-worker productivity. You don't get less productive as an individual just because you get a child, even though household income per capita drops.  

Poland has very low labor participation, only 10.75 million out of 38 million work productively. 

&gt;Skoda and Tatra.

Tatra is a microcap company, are you serious? There are hundreds of larger companies in Poland. Skoda isn't Czech anymore, if you count Skoda as Czech, why not Fiat? Their largest factory is in Poland.  

&gt;Definitely not France they are net contributors, aka they pay more than they get.  

France is a net contributor when all is summed up, but French agriculture is the biggest recipient of **production** subsidies. Agricultural subsidies subsidize **production**, cohesion funds finance **investments**.  You're trying to change the topic to weasel out of your incorrect statements:     

""While Poland has specialized on EU subsidized **production**""

&gt;FIAT would produce just as many cars if the built a plant in Italy. Workers aren't a main cost driver since much of those plants are automated

They aren't. They employ about 5000 people just in one factory! That's nowhere near ""automated"" (that doesn't mean they don't use automation). [Production video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa86DG1NJD8).  

Even electronics and semiconductor industry isn't fully automated, and they are the most automated of all.  

General automation just isn't going to happen until androids exist. 

Workers are still a main cost driver.  

&gt;The result of that can be seen in this graph. 15 years of stagnation in industrial production in the Eurozone

Really? What about demography? There's nobody new to sell to! There's no demand for increased production. The only growth that can happen is from better efficiency.  

Most people in Europe already own more stuff than they use, especially electronics.  

The only growing regions (mainly Africa and India) are too poor to buy anything.  

&gt;And gross wages? No the don't show what workers cost. That would be unit labor costs actually

How do you think they are calculated? Worker cost (gross wage + other costs) divided by generated output.  
Outside of public companies generated output is secret. So the gross wage is the best possible estimator of actual productivity in existence, because productivity can't be lower than that.  

&gt;Communist? Really? because I don't like Poland?  

You're a communist because you think of labor differently from other productive capital. That's the core of Marxism, treating human labor magically.  

Moving production to a place with lower wages is exactly the same thing as changing machines to a more efficient ones, or moving to a place with cheaper energy. You're calling these efficiency increases destructive. That's Marxist.

&gt; and you're going back to your initial argument relies on twisting my argument.

I'm not even sure what you are referring to here.

&gt; World War 1 was motivated by the foolery of men that got high off of Bismarck's ass-fumes.

If you knew any German history at all, you would know Bismarck was actually kicked out of his office by Wilhelm II because he was *too pacifist* and considered Germany to be ""saturiert"". World War I was carefully prepared by Europes industrial-military complex  - most famously the Thyssen, Blohm and Krupp groups - ever since the early 1900s and just needed a reason to eventually trigger. It had precedessor conflicts, though (google ""Kanonenbootpolitik"").

&gt; World War 2 was motivated by the foolery of several nations getting high on the fumes of their burning nations

Actually, the European Theatre was triggered by Hitler starting job-creation policies that eventually had to be paid, and he planned to get the dough for that from the spoils of a war. The Pacific Theatre was triggered by Japan's attempt to secure natural ressources in Northern China in 1937 - and US's Standard Oil trying to do the same (which led to scrap metal embargoes against Japan and thus directly to Pearl Harbour). The US-part of the Vietnam War was triggered by geopolitical fears about strategic shipping routes and a possible communist takeover of US-friendly Thailand and Singapore.

&gt; But the causes of these wars don't matter, because we're not talking about attacking, we're talking about defending another NATO member in the event of a Russian attack. 

Indeed. And most think it was an error to let these Eastern European countries into NATO in the first place, because they have virtually no military ressources, but are prime victims. They were allowed in because the US wanted to ruffle the Russian's jimmies ... and the US has been successful in doing so. 

&gt; You're very strung up in an ideology that has no basis in reality. 

Well, obviously you think nuclear war is winnable. I wonder which of our ideologies is less based in reality. 

&gt; and you are preaching the betrayal of an agreement that has kept Europe more peaceful than it ever has been.

The absence of war is not peace. Still, NATO should have died when the Cold War ended. 

&gt; The pacifist nation will always be at the boots of its neighbors.

That's pseudoreligious dogma. 

&gt; [Switzerland]

Switzerland is one hell of a country to invade for very little economic gain. It's also very, very easy to defend. They're not ""bigger wolves"", they're just not worth the expense in material and human life - it's easier to just trade with them.

&gt; Your standpoint has no merit in a world full of aggressors,

It's illegal to not-pay your taxes, but just for your information you can minimize the chance of being taxed if you:

- undeclare the value of your parcel (remain credible, if it weights 50kg don't declare ""15$ - rock samples"")

- send small parcels

There's a tradeoff though as you don't get a tracking (airmail) and if the parcel is lost you won't get refunded of it's whole value (because you undeclared). Also, in case the parcel is inspected by the customs and your ""25$ spare parts"" is actually an apple watch, your friend will be responsible for it and will have to deal with the customs (usually that means paying the tax to the full value of the product + some fine).

Tesla is a nice marketing gig for sure that makes good business decisions and know how to communicate well. But the product itself is not very innovative or well-engineered overall:

* The battery is assembled from off-the-shelf components (good business idea, not really good engineering) Packaging of the components is rather poor as they have pre-defined form factors.
* screen instead of knobs and buttons (good business decision as it is faster to write some GUI than design knobs, poor engineering non-the-less as it is still considered a lot safer to turn knobs blindly while driving then slide some GUI elements around). 
* over-the-air updates might sound innovative, but are also a way to use the consumer as a cheap tester and get the product to market early. 
* one model policy is good business decision as it is very cheap to have no derivates, shows that the Tesla engineering/manufacturing is not up to speed yet and lacks engineering power
* haptics, manufacturing quality, etc. don't need discussion. They have miles and miles to make up until they reach premium segment here.

null,false,Mutangw,null,null,null,"The tactics they use to recruit are similar but it's more understandable for someone to fall for ""get rich quick"" schemes rather than ""join our terror group and murder/rape civilians for a living"". Falling for the latter requires a highly warped moral compass to begin with.

It's probably better to compare it to other political movements rather than pyramid schemes though. Young, often educated adults tend to look for a powerful meaningful identity to cling to, a cause to fight for (though not necessarily in a violent way), and they feel driven to bring about change to the world. Some young Jews go to Israel to fight for the IDF, people of various races and cultures have gone to Kurdistan to fight for the Kurds, some people volunteer in Africa to work for charities. Some people turn to far-left or far-right political activism and become professional protesters. It's the same motivation behind all of these movements, people wanting to change the world. 

The difference is most of the above movements/groups attract people because of their positive propaganda. People join these causes because they feel they can make the world a better place. 

Meanwhile ISIS' recruitment propaganda emphasises how brutal and violent they are, it's not as if anyone who joins can say ""I didn't know that I would be expected to execute Shiite Muslims!"" Their propaganda emphasises a fundamentalist interpretation of Islam that marks the majority of Muslims as heretics. 

People who join ISIS are barbaric, no amount of cultural relativism can get around the fact that these people knowingly joined a self-professed savage terror group. Those who want to make a positive difference to the world have other options open to them.

Je vais détailler un peu ma pensée : dans le secteur du transport de personne il y a actuellement plusieurs niveau de service :

- la taxis, le service le plus basique, pratique, rapide, ""moins"" cher, le mec t'amène du point A au point B et basta

- le VTC, service souvent plus cher donc le client est en droit d'attendre une qualité de service supérieure = accueil plus sympathique, rafraîchissement à l'intérieur (vu qu'ils en parlent dans l'article), éventuellement véhicule plus confortable/en meilleur état (les tacos parisien sont déjà bon la dessus)

C'est pareil dans les avions low cost, le service est moins bon que sur une compagnie style Air France et ça choque personne. Je parle du service pas de l'accueil. 

Après si uber permet d'améliorer le standing des taxis, parfait ! A condition que ca ne soit pas reflèté dans le prix...

When it comes to useful ignorant idiots - take a good long look in the mirror. 

You have resorted to completely baseless strawman arguments and ad hominem attacks, because you have nothing else to back up your agenda.

P.S. It is the Neocons that are undermining the West. See Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz, John McCain and Victoria Nuland - rabid Neocon Assistant Secretary of state, married to PNAC co-founder Robert Kagan (the other co-founder was Neocon Nutjob Bill Kristol). PNAC is the Neocon agenda for perpetual war by destabilizing the Middle East published between 1997 and 2000 (it's been very successful). It's also wrecked the US economy by wasting $6tn so far on utterly stupid and counter productive wars.

Victoria Nuland was the personal assistant to Dick Cheney when he was VP. They don't come any nuttier or more rabidly Neocon than dear old Vicky. 

Victoria Nuland was the one that said ""Fuck the EU"" plotting the wrecking of Ukraine on the infamous conversation that was caught on tape. http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v48Jr1J65TA/VVpauHepqAI/AAAAAAAAB58/caiZzNtLWGc/s1600/Nuland%2Bfuck%2BEU.jpg The wrecking of Ukraine has also been highly successful with current inflation running at 60% and GDP down 17.6% year on year (and still rapidly falling). The Neocon Nutjobs are now looking for European taxpayers to waste several billions in a futile attempt to bail Ukraine out.

The Not-So-Secret Ukraine Phone Call
http://www.thenation.com/blog/178293/not-so-secret-ukraine-phone-call#

Extract from the article:-

Let it first be noted that it shouldn’t be surprising that Nuland would come off as a would-be imperialist or game player. If anything, she’s long been the neoconservative inside the Obama administration. For starters, for years she served as chief foreign policy adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney and then as the George W. Bush administration’s ambassador to NATO.

&gt; Little Italy is universally seen as a tourist trap.

I concur. However the argument about the food still stands, some examples just on top of my head:

* What in the name of Christ is Fettuccini Alfredo??? Unknown in Italy. And it would be fettuccin**e**, anyway (like salam**e** and linguin**e**).
* Bologna/Baloney: not even remotely close to [mortadella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortadella)
* Pepperoni! [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_pepper) is a peperon**e** in italy. What you refer to with pepperoni is a chewy and mass processed version of ""salamino piccante"". 
* Chicken pizza. It would probably incite mass revolts here.
* Mac &amp; cheese: sometimes considered of italian origin. Nope.
* [Parmesan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmesan): haha, nice try folks. Not even close.
* Garlic-whatever. **Not a thing, not now, not ever**. I cannot really overstress this. In italy garlic is used sparingly and fresh. Overuse of garlic (or other overpowering spices) is only useful to cover up other ingredients of questionable quality.
* Spaghetti Bolognese. Oh, boy, where do I begin? The types of pasta that can scoop up real bolognese ragù do not include spaghetti. You want broader cuts such as (preferredly homemade) egg [Tagliatelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagliatelle) or go all-in and do [Lasagne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasagne).
And the watery tomato shit that is being routinely passed off as bolognese sauce is nothing short of a travesty.
* Caesar salad: unknown in italy.
* Chicken parmesan: ditto.
* Meatballs on spaghetti: what do you think? Only kind of meat I can think of that is meant to be eaten with pasta is ragu alla napoletana and [ragu barese](https://culinariaitalia.wordpress.com/2008/06/13/ragu-alla-barese).

In any case, I don't want to pass off as elitist. To be honest I rarely expect exotic restaurants to be accurate. They are selling a culinary stereotype. It is true for italiant restaurants in the US *as well as* for US diners or steakhouses in italy. Probably also for chinese, indian, thai and mexican joints.

&gt; Quesito – Acquisto di oggetti di scarso valore tramite internet:

&gt; Spesso effettuo acquisti di scarso valore tramite internet ed a volte ho la sorpresa di dover pagare delle spese doganali. Vorrei sapere come vengono calcolate queste spese doganali?

&gt; Risposta: Sotto il profilo doganale, la vigente normativa comunitaria (art. 23 del Regolamento CE 1186/2009 che dal 1° gennaio 2010 sostituisce il Regolamento CEE n.918/83) consente l'ammissione in franchigia dal dazio all'importazione per le spedizioni composte da merci di valore trascurabile spedite da un soggetto residente in un paese extra UE ad una persona che si trova nella Comunità, sempreché il valore della stessa spedizione non superi il valore intrinseco di 150 €.

&gt; Per valore intrinseco, s’intende il valore del bene escluso il costo del trasporto e dell’eventuale assicurazione.
&gt; Sono esclusi dalla fruizione della franchigia in questione i prodotti alcolici, i profumi e l’acqua da toletta, i tabacchi ed i prodotti del tabacco.

&gt; Sotto il profilo fiscale, si precisa che, diversamente dalla franchigia ai fini daziari (fissata a 150 €), la franchigia ai fini dell’IVA è fissata sul valore intrinseco di 22 € (art.5 del DM n.489/97); ad esempio, per l’acquisto di un bene avente un valore compreso tra i 22 ed i 150 €, sullo stesso verrà applicata la franchigia ai fini daziari mentre verrà regolarmente applicata la relativa aliquota IVA.

&gt; Appare opportuno precisare che se il valore del bene supera i limiti di franchigia il soggetto importatore è tenuto al pagamento dei diritti doganali afferenti l'intero valore del bene acquistato.
&gt; 
&gt; Pertanto, nel caso in cui non si verificano le citate condizioni, in linea generale, al momento dell'introduzione in Italia di merce con origine da un Paese extra UE, l'importatore dovrà provvedere al pagamento:
&gt; 
&gt;     dei dazi (se previsti), che sono calcolati sul “valore della transazione” 
&gt;     (valore comprensivo delle spese di trasporto e assicurazione) e le cui aliquote
&gt;     variano a seconda della merce che si intende importare;

&gt;     dell'IVA (applicata secondo le vigenti aliquote) calcolata sul

&gt; 
&gt; Si precisa, tuttavia, che è necessario stabilire con precisione la tipologia della merce, anche da un punto di vista merceologico, sia per l’applicazione dell’esatto trattamento daziario e fiscale, sia per accertare l’eventuale necessità di licenze o l’esistenza di limitazioni all'importazione che, comunque, non vengono applicate quando le merci possono godere della franchigia.

&gt; Informazioni utili in proposito si possono acquisire consultando il sito web di questa Agenzia (www.agenziadogane.gov.it), alla pagina ""Tariffa Doganale TARIC"".

&gt; Si fa presente comunque che la classifica definitiva della merce viene determinata direttamente dai funzionari doganali solo all'atto della presentazione della stessa in dogana.

I'm pleased to hear that. I like it over here and if someone plans to migrate to Germany it's always like an approval.

Good luck finding “alte deutsche Traditionen” in Germany. This isn’t the country of Prussia and Bismarck any more. This is a modern 21. century country that integrates influences from all over the world. 

Just remember that nowadays Döner is Germanys favourite fast food, followed by Burgers and Pizza. (See: [Das beliebteste Fast Food der Deutschen](http://de.statista.com/infografik/860/das-beliebteste-fast-food-der-deutschen/))

When it comes to music, Germany foremost likes english Rock and Pop, followed by Oldies and Evergreens, german Rock and Pop and only than Schlager which isn’t very traditional either. It’s post WW2 music and the most well known artist in that field is Helene Fischer who was born in Krasnoyarsk / Siberia. Traditional german music is liked by a much smaller minority of germans (See: [Beliebteste Musikrichtungen in Deutschland in den Jahren 2013 und 2014](http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/171224/umfrage/beliebteste-musikrichtungen/))

&gt; Ich gehöre klar nicht in Amerika und habe einen genauen Plan, zu nach Deutschland kommen.

Just make sure that you’re not idealizing country and people. I do not know how often and for how long you have been to Germany before but you should definitely plan on visiting first. If you do so you should plan for a longer stay to make sure you get a **real** view of the country. Participating in / watching some fancy traditional stuff won’t give you a realistic impression.

&gt; Wenn ich kein Deutscher bin, was bin ich dann?

I do not know about your citizenship or where you where born and raised but as I understood it you are an american that wants to leave his/her country and move to Germany.

Meme apres l'independance on maintient toujours un mode de vie similaire au mode francais, la majorite des etudiants etudient trois langues (Francais, Anglais et Arabe) et passent leur bac en Fr meme si c'est un programme libanais. Moi j'etais dans un lycee francais, et ca me donne un avantage culturel, malgre le fait que ceux qui ne le sont pas sont culturellement et intellectuellement superieurs a beaucoup d'etudiants arabes, ca se voit a travers le nombre de bourses et competitions qu'ils gagnent/recoivent. 

Niveau culture il on ne peut pas comparer avec tout autre pays arabe en particulier en matiere de liberte et liberte d'expression, notre histoire est tres longue et encree dans la region, nous avons vu les croisades et donc il y a beaucoup de diversite ethnique (peau semite, et caucasienne etc) et d'autre part la fierte d'etre descendants des pheniciens, inventeurs de l'alphabet. 

C'est cette identification independante qui aussi a accentue la guerre civile de 1975 a 1990, en particulier face au Palestiniens. Vers la fin de la guerre jusqu'aujourd'hui beaucoup de nous (chretiens) et musulmans ont cesse de s'identifier comme arabes vu le manque de solidarite, mais aussi les stereotypes qui s'appliquent aux arabes qui forcement ne s'appliquent pas au Liban. 

Notre environement a lui seul renforce ceci, beaucoup de verdure, de montagnes et donc beaucoup de ski et sports d'hiver, nous sommes les seuls a avoir ca a part dans quelques regions israeliennes. 


C'est vrai on n'a pas autant d'argent et de gratte ciels que Dubai, mais nous avons quelquechose de plus important et c'est une histoire et une culture. Quelquechose que nous ne partageons que tres peu avec la Syrie (avant la guerre et meme aujourd'hui) et d'une certaine facon avec les colons israeliens (je sais, je sais blaspheme, mais ne pas l'admettre serait mentir). 

C'est tres complique et c'est tres simplifie ici, mais il faut garder en tete le fait que meme si on cesse de s'identifier comme etant arabes, on reste solidaires avec certains pays, en particulier la syrie.

When the collective will of the people is wrong (which most of the time is just a subjective assessment), then those who think like that (as well as those who don't) have the right to argue their position and try to convince the rest of people of it; in this day and age there are plenty of avenues to have a plural debate. If in the end policies are enacted that have worse consequences than the alternative would have had (which again, it's usually impossible to assess accurately), then the population can face them and learn from them.

It's, in my opinion, a much fairer paradigm than what happens with current authoritarian governments, where the population is forced to face the consequences of decisions that aren't theirs, and that are more often than not targeted to benefit only a small section of it (which almost always includes those making said decisions) to the detriment of the rest.

In many ways, Americans have a cleaner perspective on Roma **because** they're not influenced by personal experience as much, and thus are less biased. They simply apply the principle that hatred and discrimination against any ethnicity or demographic is wrong by default, and that is the correct principle to have.

If you or someone you know has fallen victim to robbery or theft, or you live in an environment which is pretty much an echo chamber on a specific issue, you're far less likely to have a neutral, balanced viewpoint.

null,false,qwertzinator,GERM,Germany,null,"&gt; For decades, linguists have debated how Indo-European got to Europe. Some favor the idea that the original farmers brought Indo-European into Europe from Turkey. Others think the language came from the Russian steppes thousands of years later.

To clarify that bit a little more: The so-called 'kurgan hypothesis', which states that the Indo-European languages came from mound-building herding cultures in the pontic steppes, is the mainstream hypothesis among linguistics because the linguistic evidence (i.e. reconstructed vocabulary) is quite strong. The 'Anatolian hyothesis', on the other hand, is mostly followed by archaeologists, chief among them Colin Renfrew, because archaeologically, the influx of Near Eastern farmers is very visible and gives a neat explanation for language displacement. It is at odds with the linguistic evidence though. David Anthony is an archaeologist and proponent of the kurgan theory. His book ""The Horse, the Wheel, &amp; Language"" gives a good picture of where and how the IE proto-language has probably originated and dispersed.

The problem European politicians have with it is that they're far too blunt about it. They will go on live television and say ""immigrants HAVE TO assimilate"" in the most abrupt and straightforward way, which pretty much achieves the exact opposite effect and boosts resistance and rejection of local culture.

The easiest way to have someone's culture change is in such a way that they don't know and aren't aware that their culture is changing in subtle, but significant ways. People's natural reaction to force is to oppose that force. So long as they feel that government or the public is systematically and openly trying to force them to give up their religion or heritage, they are going to resist.

Social engineering is a subtle process. We need to create an environment that everyone *wants* to be a part of, and not only for the material benefits.

Geld ist ein Tauschmittel, so wird sichergestellt, dass genug für den Wirtschaftskreislauf zur Verfügung steht. Wir haben derzeit eher das umgekehrte Problem: die Banken machen das nicht in ausreichendem Maße, deswegen mangelt es an Liquidität. Vereinfacht gesagt, die europäische Wirtschaft stottert, weil nicht genug Geld fließt.

Wichtiger für die Stabilität der Banken ist die ""leverage ratio"", d.h. das Verhältnis zwischen dem von ihr ausgeliehenen Geld und dem Eigenkapital. Wenn das zu hoch wird und dann ein paar Kredite baden gehen, dann nennt man das Ergebnis gemeinhin Insolvenz. Das ist u.a. Lehmann Brothers passiert.

La définition du groupe ""Juifs"" n'est pas ""racial"" mais un peu héréditaire, un peu culture. 

Du coup, tu dis antisémitisme au lieu de racisme. Ils ont aussi le sionisme à la place du nationalisme puisqu'encore une fois, ils ne sont pas un peuple homogène ethniquement et culturellement.

L'antisionisme et le sionisme sont des termes dangereux parcequ'ils ne veulent pas dire la même chose selon à qui tu parles.
Le sionisme dans sa définition initiale c'est ""la formation d'un état pour le peuple Juif en Terre Sainte"". Maintenant, tu peux considérer que la sionisme a réussi. Toutefois, certains ont mis à jour le mot. Tu peux avoir des ""post-sionistes"" (à mon humble avis, la majorité des israéliens) qui disent ""ok, on a un état, maintenant, il s'agit de s'arranger avec nos voisins"". T'as des néo-sionistes qui veulent rajouter la Cisjordanie (Judée et Samarie, pour eux, des provinces ""historiques"" des royaumes juifs de jadis). T'as également des sionistes religieux qui trouvent que l'état est pas assez Juif (genre y a des femmes ailleurs qu'à la maison à s'occuper de leur 9ième enfant et que y a encore de trucs qui tournent pendant Shabbat). 

Si on accepte la définition de sioniste=qqun qui veut un état pour les Juifs, un antisioniste serait quelqu'un qui leur refuse un état. Les tarés ultraorthodoxes juifs (genre Neturei Karta) sont antisionistes dans ce sens là. Ils n'ont pas encore reçu le message de leur messie pour qu'il les autorise à revenir (où ils ont prévu de prendre tous les habitants non juifs comme esclaves, mais bon, tout le monde l'oublie ça). 
En pratique, à part eux, ""antisionisme"" ça va de ""je refuse qu'il y ait un état Juif et je veux tous les tuer pour rendre la terre aux Palos"" (Hamas) à ""je nie qu'ils existent"" (genre le Qatar qui cache les drapeaux israéliens) à ""je m'oppose à l'existence d'Israel, sans vouloir tuer les gens et de toute façon je les appelle ""entité sioniste"" "" (C'est l'Iran). De plus, on peut trouver l'antisionisme dieudonné (""ouais nique les Ju...les sionistes, Palestine libre toussa, quenelle. Ça fera 40 € mon bon monsieur...pour....la cause!!"") et l'antisionisme de façade (""mort aux juifs... pardon Israel est méchant je voulais dire"").
En plus, étant donné qu'il est hautement improbable qu'Israel disparaisse, il est inutile d'être antisioniste au sens littéral du terme.

En conclusion, stricto sensu l'antisémitisme n'est pas un racisme, mais l'homophobie non plus. On devrait arrêter de faire du verbiage et de couper les cheveux en 4 et juste dire ""**xénophobie**""

L'antisionisme en pratique, c'est la critique des actions d’Israël. Toutefois, étant donné que c'est juste un truc de mode la critique d'Israel (la plupart ne connaissent *rien* à la situation) et qu'il s'agit souvent d'un antisémitisme déguisé, il faut simplement se méfier. Je préfère ceux qui disent simplement ""je condamne les excès d’Israël"". 

Réponse bonus:  Le terme ""antisémitisme"" a été crée, littéralement parlant, pour critiquer les Juifs et eux seulement, par [wilhelm marr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Marr). Il ne concerne pas tous les sémites au sens où on l'entend aujourd'hui (tous les peuples du moyen orient).

&gt;The 31-year-old told James Risen of The New York Times in October 2013 that there was “a zero percent chance the Russians or Chinese have received any documents.”

-

&gt;Risen also reported, citing an encrypted chat with Snowden, that the former CIA technician ""gave all of the classified documents he had obtained to journalists he met in Hong Kong.""

-

&gt;Two days after checking out of the Mira Hotel on June 10, Snowden showed The South China Morning Post (SCMP) an unknown number of documents revealing ""operational details of specific [NSA] attacks on [Chinese] computers, including internet protocol (IP) addresses, dates of attacks, and whether a computer was still being monitored remotely.""

-

&gt;The cache given to Poitras and Greenwald allegedly included 58,000 ""highly classified UK intelligence documents,"" The Telegraph reported in August after the UK government detained David Miranda, Glenn Greenwald's partner, as he traveled through London's Heathrow Airport.

-

&gt;Authorities say they confiscated electronic devices in which classified documents were stored as well as a password.

-

&gt;“Much of the material is encrypted. **However, among the unencrypted documents ... was a piece of paper that included the password for decrypting one of the encrypted files on the external hard drive recovered from the claimant,""** the UK government stated to the court.

-

&gt;senior UK officals allege that Moscow gained access to more than 1 million classified files, and the journalists are believed to have received about 200,000. And it's still unclear what happened to the documents not given to journalists.

The nazis weren't the first to use death as a 'solution' to the gypsies, and they weren't the last to enact eugenics programs against them (Sweden ended theirs in 1975-6).  The nazis just have the dubious distinction of being the most efficient.

""Popular"" solutions to the ""gypsy problem"" for the last 500 years have been centred around:

* Death
* Deportation (to where? the next country just does the same)
* Slavery
* Forced sterilization
* Forced abortions
* Forced ""integration"" (removing their children to be raised by native families)

Most people will casually assume I'm referring to nazi Germany here.  I'm not.  Yes they were persecuted by the nazis - but at the end of the war, they were also persecuted by their 'liberators'.  When Sweden's humanitarian convoy of ""white busses"" rescued over 15,000 people from german internment camps towards the end of the war, the Roma were purposely excluded because it was illegal for them to enter Sweden.  They were left where they were found.

But I don't want to sound like I'm picking on Germany, or Sweden - most of Europe has participated in these programs at one time or another - forced adoptions have been recorded in Scandinavia right up until 1975.  Forced (or 'coerced') sterilizations Czechoslovakia right up until it's dissolution (when it formally ended, but cases have been recorded as recently as 2007).  Deportation is of course still the trendy option, with France hitting the news in 2010 with actions which didn't really differ much from their being expelled in 1504 or prohibited residence in 1660.

Und es ware vollkommen egal. GLaubst du, es würde sich irgendwas ändern, bloß weil auf einmal die Linke dran ist?

Remember: Wir hatten das Experiment bereits! Die Grünen waren mal die Linken!

Was du unterschätzt ist die Freiheit von Menschen. Wir haben sehr wenig wirkloiche Freiheit - *eingebaut*. Das hat nichts mit Unterdrückung zu tun!

Menschen sind *by design* (ich meine damit evolution, keinen weißbärtigen Alten auf der Wolke) Gruppenviecher. Alleine ist ein Mensch einfach nur tot, mehr nicht. Ja auch heute - setze doch mal einen Berliner mitten im Urwald oder in der Savanne ab ohne alles...

Gruppendynamik and anpassen und abschauen sind uns eingebaut. In diesen Diskussionen werden Menschen wie Gehirne betrachtet, dabei sind Menschen viel mehr die einzelnen Neuronen! Soll heißen, das ""Menschsein"" ist die Summe, nicht das Individuum, so gerne man medial auch auf der (fast nicht existenten) Freiheit des Einzelnen herumreitet. Siehe Antoine de Saint-Exupery ""Le Petit Prince"", dort insbesondere den Planeten mit dem König. Unsere Freiheit hat sehr enge Grenzen, selbst die der Mächtigen.

Wir haben Demokratie? Und die Gründungsgeschichte der USA ist es, König und Adel abgeschafft zu haben?

Warum schaut dann die Masse dauernd nach einem FÜHRER, der alles richtet? Okay, man darf das Wort nicht mehr nennen, aber du und alle meinen doch genau das: Wenn doch nur die *richtigen* Leute ""an der Macht"" wären, dann ware alles viel viel besser! Die *richtigen* Leute richten alles!

Das wird nichts. Es müssen ALLE mitmachen. Änderung muss von unten kommen! Die Mächtigen können - und müssen! - nur das machen, was die Masse ihnen vorgibt. Die Mächtigen sind nicht deshalb mächtig, weil sie wirklich mächtig sind - sie sind mächtig, weil sie die Realität und damit das Verhalten und die Erwartungen der Masse ihrer Mitmenschen verstehen. Wenn du einfach nur die Leute ""oben"" austauschst bekommst du weitgehend das gleiche Ergebnis, nur in anderer Farbe.

Because big companies are notoriously* bad at innovation due to their size? Smaller companies are easier to specialize and don't suffer from communication problems as much.  
Then there's the aspect of R&amp;D being expensive, and they've already invested hundreds of generations into ICE cars, which already have a climate and air quality destroying economy in place, and gasoline isn't correctly priced, as its negative externalities remain unaccounted for.  
They had little actual competition so far, so there was little need for them to do anything other than the usual.

The entire purpose of Tesla is to shake that stagnant state of affairs up and push other auto makers to get serious.

Electric cars haven't failed. They've never been *seriously* tried. No car maker ever tried to make a good car that just so happens to be electric.

It isn't a vicious cycle at all.  It's true that the state's expenditure does have an effect on the state's revenue, but you can clearly notice from the graph that the variations in expenditure and revenue isn't proportional nor even linear. 

Furthermore, the way you chose to present the scale in your graph happens to be a bit deceiving, as you've opted to represent between 60,000 and 140,000 MEur.   If you produced a graph which scaled between 0 and 140,000 you'd notice that the adjustment was well on track and it didn't took much more effort to ballance Greece's books.  [See here a different graph of the exact same data](http://i.imgur.com/14VUQnE.png).

In fact, last year the former greek government did managed to get to a primary surplus.  This didn't entailed a drop in revenue to zero. 

Furthermore, one of Greece's problems is tax evasion, which has a direct impact on the state's revenue but doesn't imply a public expenditure increase.

So, as can be easily seen, this ""vicious cycle"" blurb is just an unrealistic myth that has only traction in the minds of those who intend to stay far away from reality and facts.",null,0,null,1434279453,null,0,false,0,cs62kn5,null,t3_39sdm8,null,t1_cs62kn5,null,t1_cs60hca,null,null,null,1437555302,null,32,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,32,null

Pointless, naive discussion. You'll keep repeating that effort is necessary to integrate them, I'll keep pointing the obvious that it is not integration they want, that there are cultural forces that will take serious decades to diminish.

The Jews have loads of money and reign a lot of power everywhere, that is why it is more acceptable to speak out against gypsies than against Jews. Jews through their influence can boycott any antisemitic opinion and make out the speaker look as bad as a murderer. 
Also, Jews do not need help, they do not need integration. It is in their culture to keep to themselves and also make themselves an integral and important wheel in the local society in which they live.

This is their culture. The Roma have a different culture. 

Also, the Jews have never caused the amount of distress the Roma have caused. And the Jews had been persecuted and such a priori, they had plenty of reasons. 


When it comes to offering help to Roma people, I will present you with the typical case. If you offer schooling aid, there will be a whole family of 6 Roma kids seeking to trick the system and get the benefits without the added responsibilities, as guided by their mother, for one Roma kid who would actually use the aid to improve his condition. As such, he will be drowned in the will of the others. 

You cannot win. You must let things take their course. People are less violent now and will not put a pike in your ass for stealing. They will correct their behavior ONLY if they learn that you cannot get away with anything you do and they don't get the ""race and persecution"" card to work out for them as it does now. 

They have EQUAL chances to go to school, apply for a scholarship, study, or work, make fair money, as everybody else. 

Tolerating their behavior, taking responsibility for their actions while they take none will teach them nothing, as they will see the benefits of using the help and not going  through the hassle of actually changing themselves.

Eine Annahme wären Rundungsunsicherheiten, oder eben von den Seitenbetreibern eingeführte Schummelfaktoren, die das Stimmverhältnis verfälschen.

Diese Grabenkämpfe helfen mir bei meiner Suche allerdings nicht wirklich weiter.

Tatsache ist, dass dieses Video noch vor einigen Monaten auf Youtube zugänglich war, und nun nicht mehr auffindbar ist - selbstverständlich wurde es mittlerweile auch aus der NDR Mediathek entfernt.

If you see doctors, scientists etc. as aristocrats (and lets be fair -- they were upper class, many times richer than the working class, able to afford big houses and servants) and not important cogs in the society, then the exile to Siberia was very understandable. 

If I recall correctly, when Soviet Union started training people to specialised professions, they trained so many that the value of the profession (eg. the money you could demand) fell strongly. Meanwhile the money for wielders etc. rose strongly.

Hydrogen fuel cells aren't a workable solution, because  
• Hydrogen is not an energy source - instead it acts like a battery. You have to get your hydrogen from somewhere first (i.e. electrolysis), and that requires energy. Much more energy than if you charged a simple battery instead (about twice as much).  
• In addition to that, hydrogen molecules are the smallest molecules there are. Hydrogen is hard to contain due to that, has to be stored in very low temperatures, and makes materials brittle.  
• Hydrogen is also explosive.  
• On top of that, you need a way to transport hydrogen to the cars as well, which is more costly (including for the environment) than transporting electricity.  
• You also use an electric motor in hydrogen fuel cell cars anyways, and you use a battery in them as well anyways, because fuel cells don't produce energy in a way that matches use at all times. So by dropping the fuel cell and the hydrogen tank and using a better battery instead, you gain all sorts of efficiencies and practicality.

You keep on misunderstanding on what democracy is about. Read again above.

&gt; Eu said no more free money, get your shit together

I am not sure you understand the basic premise of the bailouts. 
There were never free money for Greece. Free and with no conditions money were only for the financial institutions that were lending recklessly to a reckless government. Evident by the fact that only 10% (or ~24bn.) went to the Greek people *in exchange for austerity* which depressed the GDP by ~40bn. Greece did not get any free money, not at all.

The only reason that Greece now needs money is for repaying the previous debt. It doesn't need any (or very little) money for domestic usage since there will be small surpluses/deficits. 

People don't seem to realize two things:

1) The Grexit **will** happen. There is no doubt about that, either today, in a year or in two. When Europe thinks that the positives of a grexit for them are outweighing the negatives, there will be no second thought or even asking Greece about it. There are no saviours but ourselves.

2) The new memorandum that is hailed as ""at least there will be some stability"" will be certain death for the Greek economy and society. Young people will migrate and Greece will be a country of 70 year olds with no hope of recovery at all. The way of the rupture will be just as hard but at least there will be hope for recovery. When international well-esteemed economists argue that a Grexit would be better than the creditors' deal, that says something.",null,0,null,1434281061,null,0,false,0,cs62x6r,null,t3_39qmwk,null,t1_cs62x6r,null,t1_cs62a3l,null,null,null,1437555284,null,-5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-5,null

- Gypsies. Of course, in line with this post, they are the worst offenders. They are often times in the metro entrances/exits, women on the floor begging, kids running around (the most dangerous), men walking about looking for a weak, scared old person. If you are a young, reasonably large male the only ones you should really be careful around are the kids, they sneak everywhere, grab stuff and run. If you catch one the whole group will jump on you yelling and pulling and will probably grab smthg else (happened to my bro). Anyway, never get close to a gypsy, as they are quick and skilled with their hands. If you're a girl be careful of the guys, they are scum.

- African street vendors. They are everywhere (Tour Eiffel, Arc de Trimphe, Trocadéro and Montmartre are the hotspots) and sell shitty souvenirs/toys. However most are OK, just street vendors. Some are there to fuck with you. In particular be careful when you go to the Montmartre stairs, they will see that you are a tourist and try to put a bracelet on your arm saying its a ""gift"" for a ""national holiday"" or some shit. Don't let them, they will ask for ridiculous amounts of money for that shit, and won't let you go. They are groups of 3-4 large-ish african men, but don't be intimidated, they don't want any over the top fuss since what they're doing is illegal and they probably are too. If they manage to grab you just keep on going, clearly state you don't want it. If you speak french they will let you go.

- At night, avoid the area around Les Halles, the train stations Gare du Nord and Gare de L'Est and the areas in the north eastern part of Paris (18th,19th and 20th arondissements), unless you're with some french people. As a tourist you are easily singled out. Groups of youths in those areas might be dangerous. Careful with the hot blooded arabs.

Finally, Paris proper is not a dangerous city, except for some tiny areas where there is nothing to see anyway, and don't be worried by the amount of arabs/blacks, most are well integrated and completely cool.

And I can't talk about (the other) Baltic countries, but in Finland communists were witchhunted and industrialisation was intentionally put on the backpedal because it was feared that the workers might rebel in the poor conditions.

Well, social inequality is a great thing when you're at the top, no matter what's the alternative.

But of course this isn't fair, because the deportings weren't done by Baltic workers, but Russians. But the social inequality did kill a lot of people, too. Factory work was hard and dangerous.

Neat.

&gt;Research into gender equality in the workplace reveals a mixed picture. A 2014 report from the International Labour Organisation found a marked gender pay gap, but noted that if wage discrimination due to factors such as “having children” was eliminated, women would receive higher salaries than men. 

&gt;More recently, professional services firm Grant Thornton declared Russia a world leader in workplace gender equality, with 40% of senior business roles held by women – the highest in the world. Why? High male mortality rates, yes, but also the legacy of equal opportunity during the Soviet Union. 

Interesting.

&gt;Although the USSR’s official line on gender parity did not always play out in practice, women enjoyed state-backed childcare, abortion rights and easy access to divorce. The Soviets launched the first woman into space, allowed women to fly on combat missions in the second world war and reserved one-third of the seats of the Congress of People’s Deputies for women.

A problem the world over:

&gt;“When I wanted to adopt, the first question was: do you have a husband?” she says. “Well, I have a boyfriend, and I have my own flat, and my own car, and my own salary, so there are a lot of plusses. But on the other side there’s a huge minus, because I don’t have a husband.” This egregious lack of husband proved most problematic when Popova ran for office in the 2011 parliamentary election. “Being a woman was a huge minus, and not having a husband was another one,” she says.

null,false,third_edition,null,null,null,"Yeah, I thought that [Tim Urban](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html) explained hydrogen cars' disadvantages nicely:

&gt; Among many reasons hydrogen cars seem inferior to EVs, here are four:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Hydrogen cars seem beholden to natural gas, a fossil fuel, in order to extract the hydrogen fuel, while electric cars get cleaner over time as electricity production gets cleaner.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) When it comes to energy density, driving range, and cost, the best case scenario for hydrogen cells is similar to where EV batteries are now, and EV batteries will get better with time.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) Hydrogen is a somewhat dangerous and difficult-to-handle substance that’s a nightmare compared to the simple wall-outlet electricity EVs use.
&gt; 
&gt; 4) Down the road, when the norm is to charge the car up in your garage, it’s going to seem primitive to have to go to a station to fuel up.
&gt; 
&gt; In an email exchange I had with Musk about hydrogen cars, he explained it like this:
&gt; 
&gt; If you take electricity coming from a solar panel and charge a battery, you can get ~90% efficiency. Simple and cheap. Instead, if you use that electricity to split water, separate the hydrogen with extreme purity, pressurize it to crazy levels (or, even worse, liquefy), transfer it to a giant (even in liquid form) hydrogen storage tank in the car and then recombine it with oxygen to generate electricity, you would be lucky to get ~20% efficiency. Expensive, complex, bulky and super inefficient. It loses on every dimension, including refuel time when pack swap is factored in. 
&gt; 
&gt; Cost is bad for fuel cells, but that is only one of many bad dimensions. If fuel cells were in any way better than lithium batteries, they would at least be used in satellites, some of which cost over $500 million. They are not.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, if I wasn’t already convinced, this highly-detailed, fairly devastating takedown of the argument hydrogen cars left me feeling eternally puzzled about why the Japanese companies would want to go further down that road.

For electric cars you don't need an infrastructure like we do today. Most of the time they're charged at home. And in my opinion it'll be easy to install charging stations at tenant-occupied houses and public parking lots. 

The [gigafactory](http://www.teslamotors.com/de_DE/gigafactory) will double the output of batteries produced worldwide. It'll be powered by renewable energies. 
We'll eventually need to recycle ressources much more effectively anyway instead of mining ressources all the time.

Yes, it will be a difference from what we have today. But that'll happen anyway at some point. The question in my opinion is whether we're going to actively shape the way it'll be or just react to the awaiting difficulties.",null,0,null,1434281719,null,0,false,0,cs631zd,null,t3_39rr4y,null,t1_cs631zd,null,t1_cs626zs,null,null,null,1437555271,null,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1,null

null,false,greco2k,null,null,null,"I think everyone understands that tax evasion in Greece is a social / cultural problem. But rather than assume that it has something to do with Greek people (as if it's built into the DNA) perhaps we should be looking at it as a symptom of a much larger problem. It is vital that the government finds a way to get taxes collected, but I don't see how increasing VAT at the same time is a good idea. I see it as having the opposite effect...actually pushing people to find new ways to avoid taxation. I realize how bad this sounds on the surface, particularly to a German (for example). After all, they pay their taxes by and large.
However, the average German doesn't face the same dilemma's as the average Greek. 
The Greek economy is and has been a practically closed economy throughout modern history. It's a small country (no bigger than a major city) who's elite are all interconnected (industry, press and politics) and repeatedly collude with one another to secure advantage. There is very little the average Greek citizen can do to break this stranglehold and merely blaming them for voting on the governments shows a complete lack of awareness of the reality. Personally, I think the creditors understand this and may be hoping the misery of austerity creates that cultural shift. But at what cost? But even this I'm not so sure about because it's clear and has been admitted by many of the creditors and heads of EU governments that they would prefer to deal with the old set of government elite. The very ones who have, for decades, created and perpetuated this sick socio-economic environment.
The average Greek was born in to this and had to find a way to live in this world. When he/she sees that any time they need a hospital room, or a building permit, or a drivers license, garbage collection for their business (you name it) they are nearly always put in a position of needing to slip the public servant gatekeeper an envelope full of cash just to get things moving. Sure they could complain...but at what cost? It's not as though that public servants boss isn't aware of what's happening...they likely get a cut of the cash too. Maybe they could go to the media...but what good would that do? It's so well known, the media would laugh it off as a non-story...meanwhile the service you need is not getting done. If your a business owner, this is a problem because it impacts your earnings. 

In other words, the taxes they do pay get them nearly nothing in the way of government services. The roads are shit, hospitals are shit, schools are shit. It's not a great moral leap in this situation to ask yourself ""why the fuck should I pay all these taxes?"". It's human nature.

I don't suggest that all Greek tax evaders are in this situation. But lets face it, every country has tax evaders. I'm suggesting that Greece has more precisely because of this dynamic. 

Corruption (particularly at the top of society) is THE main problem in Greece and until there is a viable, productive economy to rival the entrenched existing one and provide an alternative, nothing will ever be accomplished. For this, you need a government that is comprised of individuals that are not part of this ""click"". Unfortunately, no decent politician exists in this category. We see this with SYRIZA.

I do not see NATO as just a defensive alliance, as do very few political scientists. I would even argue that the defensive alliance part is the most important.

&gt;And no NATO member would be obligated to partake unless it's an article 5 issue. Besides, all of these operations were mandated by the UN or unambiguous humanitarian missions: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_Operations

From that perspective one could argue the Georgian war was mandated by the UN.

This is a list of operations backed by a UN mandate: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_Nations_peacekeeping_missions

&gt; You're not answering my argument: if Finland is trying to pretend it occupies a neutral position between Russia and the EU, it's doing a laughably bad job of it. The countries who could have done that, the Warsaw pact, rushed toward NATO the first chance they got.

I'd say it's doing an excellent job. It's the only country in the vicinity of Russia that hasn't resorted to vindictive politics or licking Russia's ass.

&gt; If you make the argument "" But we all know what these blocks were about, because we realize the historical context. We should do the same today"" then you shouldn't ignore it in your very next comment.

Good point. Inter capitalist rivalry justified by petty nationalism. In other words, a complete waste of resources and time. At least during the cold war we were opposed to dismal authoritarian socialism.

&gt; Then there is no use in avoiding the anger of Russia by not joining NATO, and you might as well join.

If I would share the opinion that NATO is just defensive alliance, I would agree.

&gt; Whatever best serves the goal of common defense.

Unfortunately that would serve the goal of mutual destruction or at least massive suffering.

&gt; They'll be able to take actions against the proxy. But why do you talk about proxies? Because Russia would never dare directly attack a NATO member: NATO works.

NATO has never been tested really. But Russia could easily support a rebellion or maybe even political change in a NATO country.

&gt; What should Poland and the Benelux countries have done in the '30s then? Deliver all the jews to Berlin with a nice ribbon around them to show the nazi party their good intentions? You're insane.

I don't think I'm insane. I do think it's insane to equalize the 30s with the current era.

&gt; You've already got that. Russia is testing the reaction speed of the militaries in and around the Baltic these days. Ask Sweden.

Sweden and Baltic is NATO.

&gt; But you're literally arguing that you should watch what you do lest you provoke Russian anger! You already live in fear! And why would you fear more when there are more allies backing you up? Russia is your neighbour, whatever you do, and they've shown to be eager to use their soldiers, whatever you do. What Russia decides is beyond your influence. So when it starts raining, do you try to keep good relations with the rain or do you take an umbrella?

What Russia does and what NATO does is predictable and not beyond your influence. Both work very similar, they profit from internal divisions to further their interests. Then they tell us that the guys they are supporting are the good guys and call it a day.

So if Finland can guarantee stability, I don't see a reason to join either NATO or some Russian backed alliance since the only thing they have to gain is becoming part of a worthless rivalry, while they could be profiting from both sides. And if for some unlikely reason things do turn bad, they could escape the dance all together, while the rest of Europe and Russia descends into the misery and death they sought themselves.

&gt; Finland would not cut ties with Russia. There is nothing in the NATO treaty that demands that. If Russia decides to cut ties with Finland it's their problem, but why would they do that?

There's nothing in the Warsaw pact that said you had to be an authoritarian socialist state under Soviet hegemony.

There are lots of other examples of Corporations suing governments in trade tribunals composed of unelected Corporate lawyers, like the ISDS one proposed in TPP and TTIP. Elizabeth Warren (US Senator) raised a couple. There are several currently going on in South America involving US and Canadian Corporations - one of those is Chevron trying to get out of paying for a massive clean up operation for the pollution they caused during their operations. Another dispute is against Coca Cola in Colombia over the murder of some trade union activists.

The whole purpose of ISDS is to transfer power from elected local governments to unelected transnational Corporate controlled tribunals. 

It is also to widen the scope of disputes covered by trade tribunals. E.G. Monsanto are looking to use ISDS to push back on the current bans on GMO's within the EU. It is a potential backdoor entry for Monsanto into Europe against the wishes of the overwhelming majority of people.

Fracking is also a big area that the big oil companies want to facilitate (also against the wishes of the public). Thus putting Europe at risk of pollution to ground water and earthquakes by the bullying of governments that would become available via ISDS.

Another angle the Corporations want to use is to facilitate Big Pharma increasing drug prices and elongating patents. 

There are 101 other ways the Corporations will use ISDS to increase their profits while harming the wealth and health of Europeans.

Is it really a great step to take? I think one's defence policies should be very long-term, planned and effective. If they have chosen a professional army, they should concentrate on that. If they have conscription and it works well, they should keep going with that.

Estonia has conscription and it works well, because everything is well-thought, people know that and can set their lives accordingly etc. 

Many Lithuanian men need to suddenly, however, stop their lives and go serve due to politicians' swift decisions (who themselves will not be doing anything, of course).

null,false,linklater11,null,null,null,"&gt; I agree that it should have been restructured in teh first place, though this will never happen so it can't be used as a base for discussion. 

Debt relief *has* to happen. There will always be the uncertainty of Grexit and how the inevitable losses will be assigned, since the debt is 180%. There is no other way for a recovery of Greece. Varoufakis has proposed limitless smart ways of restructuring to give a way out to other countries' governments so that it doesn't come across as debt relief.

&gt; Of course, it can't just walk away from all of its debt owned by other EZ countries. It'd create a massive moral hazard.

There is no morality on the debt itself. A debt that cannot be paid will not be paid, you cannot force otherwise. It is what it is.

If one goes on with moral hazard argument: The moral hazard comes when you assume a de facto immorality of debtors but not immorality of creditors. The moral hazard came when the EU governments decided to bailout the reckless financial institutions with your money in the first place, well knowing that there will be losses in the future. The moral hazard comes when you condemn entire generations because of the ""sacred morality of debt"" (as is the case in Greece now and fortunately wasn't the case in Germany post WWII with the debt relief).

&gt; This is where you're wrong, had it not gotten a bailout the crisis would have been much worse, due to the country being unable to finance any commitment at all.

That is absolutely wrong. Greece would certainly be in a much much better place, had it defaulted, preferably in conversation with creditors but otherwise unilaterally. Literally every economist in the world thinks so. Of course there would be some trouble financing at the start but it would never be today's abysmal position.

Furthermore if we are talking about a Europe of solidarity, democracy and ideals, there could have been some financing help for a few years until recovery. 

The much more terrifying thing though is that there is a precedent and financial institutions know that they will simply be bailed out any time they have losses. Great job to be a financial institution, you gamble and there is no way to lose.

&gt; Greece is also in its current position due to successive governments not being able to tackle entrenched interests, hence limiting the available policy tools. 

I definitely agree that Greece has very deep systemic problems related to corruption which contributed to Greece's situation. But anyone thinking that previous governments that invented and *were* the corruption would fight against it, are simply idiots. That's why Syriza is Europe's *only* chance for tackling these problems in Greece.

Opel is a subsidiary of GM (and has been since 1929), so that leaves us with 3 big car companies in Germany (albeit bigger ones. It's not like Audi got smaller in any way just by being owned by VW). 

That said, I don't think, that the buyer's decision so much about protecting our companies here, but simply something of a mistrust. The typical german reaction to an electric car (as far as I can make it out) is: ""What if I need to go 1000 km in one run?"" (Practically all trips are below 50 km, so that shouldn't be an issue, but there you are). The second is (for most models): ""What? It only can do 140 km/h?"" (or 160 or whatever - perceived - low number is in the papers). That's the drawback of having the Autobahn. Yes, people can (and do) go faster. I like to drive fast at times myself, which is why my current car can go somewhere around 220-230 km/h (real speed, not what the speedometer shows. That's rather inaccurate at those speeds anyway). But that does leave us with little to no incentive for our manufacturers to actually go electric (apart perhaps from supercars which nobody can afford anyway), as the cars typically will not be perceived fast enough -&gt; low sales.

So in the you're left with two options here: either really small cars like the i-Miev (which is a terrible name for a car sold in Germany, but that's another story), which are only bought by enthusiasts (as the battery increases the price in this range quite a bit) or much more expensive cars, for which going way beyond 200 km/h is practically a must.

How little it costs to bribe the Senate into passing a treasonous bill that codifies the passing of Sovereignty from the government to multinational crony Corporations and the Corporate appointed lawyers that will sit in judgement on Corporate issues. http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-05-30/how-little-it-cost-bribe-senates-fast-tracking-obamas-tpp-bill

Corporate issues like:-

Banking regulations

Environmental protections

Fracking (whether it is allowed or not and whether there are any environmental protections or compensation is paid for pollution or e.g. earthquake damage done)

Monsanto (whether their GMO seeds are allowed or not and whether consumers should be allowed to know whats in their food - GMO food labeling)

The price of drugs and medicines (patent protections will be increased, delaying the introduction of generic substitutes. This will enhance the profits of drugs companies while killing millions in the third world by making medicine unaffordable. It will also kill a fair few in the US)

Maintaining or increasing the profits of major Hollywood studios

Will allow increased Corporate control over the internet and how internet content will be able to be distributed. Increased censorship and reduced access to accurate information (Corporate propaganda will be more prominent).

Side issues:

TPP will cost thousands more well paid American jobs and depress US wages, creating more poverty in the US. Poverty also kills.

Working conditions will be degraded in every country that is part of the deal. There will be less employment regulation, fewer employee protections and less Health and Safety.

Wealth will be further migrated towards the top 0.01% and away from the middle class and the poor in every country. This will make the top 0.01% even more powerful than they already are.

There will be a reduction in the average standard of living of every country that is part of the deal.

The only winners out of the TPP deal are multinational Corporations, their CEOs and their major owners. Everyone else will lose out, including the economies of all of the countries that are included in the deal. (The politicians in each country will be bribed into passing the deal.)

As every country included in the deal will lose out, the other major winners will be those countries NOT included.

This means that apart from Corporate Oligarchs, China is the principle winner.

The prefrontal cortex of the human brain [doesn't finish maturing at 18.](http://hrweb.mit.edu/worklife/youngadult/brain.html) It is incomplete for years and is truly adult like at 23, sometimes as late as 25.

This region of the brain is heavily involved in [moral decision making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsolateral_prefrontal_cortex#Decision_making) as well as planning, reasoning, cognitive flexibility and inhibition.

This leads to young humans having to rely on cultural clues for a lot of that in order to function, because they are anatomically incapable of the same order of decision making as their older counterparts. This is of course not easy to see from the inside, so to speak, just like thes storm of hormones in adolescence is not easy to to be discerned for what it is when someone is embroiled in it.

This is partly what makes such young people perfect targets for warped ideological causes.

I am **not** advocating for disregarding personal responsibility on the grounds of this - actions are actions and they should have consequences.

What I am saying is that the cultural environment of these vulnerable and potentially dangerous people should be carefully influeced in a way that they are less likely to come away form their formative years with a flawed moral compass.

The downturn in economic indicators was mostly due to the fear of an impending general election, when it was clear Syriza stood a good chance of winning.

&gt; Don't blame the people, at such a high unemployment , especially on the youth, they feel they have nothing to lose, also the 2 previous government were riddled with corruption.

I appreciate that economic conditions are awful, but the Greece has no leverage in a situation like this.  It depends entirely of the good will of creditors.  Make no mistake about it - this is all good will, otherwise Greece would be charged market rates for its debt (which it is priced out of).

Obviously the UK is not in as bad a situation as Greece, but here we voted in the party that promised most austerity because we don't like the idea of a large deficit and growing national debt (whether that's a good idea is a whole other debate I won't get into).  In a democracy people choose their future and fate holds them accountable.  Picking Syriza was clearly a gamble.  You can blame people for taking an absolutely crazy gamble when there was light at the end of the tunnel.  If people backed Samaras, there's no reason to think the economy wouldn't have continued to improve and Greece would have been better off today.

In 2013 the figure was 1.1 million who hadn't been paid in 6 months. I don't know what the current figures are but given the dire liquidity, it's probably the same if not higher. I personally know people who have accepted jobs and agreed to forego pay for the first 4 months (and no guarantee that they will even get it then). But they do it in the hopes that something good may eventually happen. I think that's a pretty clear indication of where Greece is from a labor reform perspective (despite what the bailout talks are telling us).

Per quanto mi riguarda, l'accesso ad un internet super-veloce ci da' piu' possibilita' (siano mercati o talento) e riduce i costi (meno trasferte, meno carta, meno costi del personale per supportare la burocrazia).

Qualche esempio:

1. Devi fare un deployment? 3 minuti per trasferire i file con la Fibra, 2h per transferire se non hai la fibra.

2. Devi assumere qualcuno? Lo assumi in base alle capacita' non in base a dove vive (il pool dei talenti e' molto piu' grande). Per esempio, il mio team e' 3 Londra, 2 Parigi, 2 Francoforte, 4 Dublino, 1 Oxford - puoi assumere candidati migliori indipendentmente dal luogo in cui si trovano. Il tasso di dimissioni e' piu' basso e le capacita' medie sono piu' alte.

3. Venerdi' alle 11 di mattina ho dovuto organizzare un training di emergenza per un cliente in CZ. Che faccio? Rimandi a Lunedi' e spendi 1000EUR per volare oppure fai una videoconf con WebEx alle 4 del pomeriggio?

Altri vantaggi includono la flessibilita' per il dipendente, vuoi lavorare da casa perche' aspetti un pacco o perche' devi andare a prendere i bambini all'asilo? 

Il tempo fa cacare, decidi di andare in Thailndia per un mese (la mia compagna e' Thai)? Nessun problema, parto venerdi' notte e lavoro in remoto da lunedi'. Mi alzo, vado in spiaggia, alle 2pm (9AM in UK) accendo il PC e inizio a lavorare fino a sera.... capisco che non tutti possono lavoare da remoto e che non tutti vogliono andare in Thailandia per un mese...ma vuoi mettere la flessibilita' che ho? 

Per la cronaca, io ho un FTTC a 40/10MB (costo 23GBP/mese). Il massimo che potrei fare sono 150/150 ma per quello che faccio ora non mi serve. 

In Thailandia avevamo 35/35 pero' a quanto pare mia suocera ha fatto un upgrade per avere piu' canali e ora dovremmo avere 100/80.

Non voglio tirarmela e mi scuso se sembra che lo faccia, quello che voglio dire e' che il mondo cambia e avere una conessione veloce e' importantissimo. In Italia siete molto indietro. 

L'italia non puo' competere con i prodotti a basso prezzo, deve competere sulla ricerca e con nuovi prodotti/tecnologie.

Fossi in voi mi preoccuperei del fatto che ci sono una marea di sviluppatori in Asia e Europa dell'Est che stanno facendo un sacco di cose interessanti nuovi prodotti, nuovi software con un sacco di idee innovative e fanno tutto da remoto in modo molto 'smart'.

Das die Linke zur Alleinherrschaft kommt ist ja nicht wahrscheinlich. Eine linke Mehrheit wäre aber machbar wenn SPD und Grüne die eher rechts-liberalen Truppen in den eigenen Parteien unter Kontrolle bekommen würden. 

Eine linke Mehrheit im Parlament würde schon etwas ändern. Natürlich wäre es keine Revolution aber wenn auch nur ein vernünftiger Mindestlohn, eine positive Reform weg vom Hartz-IV Zwangssystem, die Erweiterung von Volksentscheiden oder eine zumindest leichte Abkehr von militaristischer Aussenpolitik etc. pp. herauskommt, dann ist das schon mal besser als bisher. Ein Schritt ist besser als keiner.

Es kommt darauf an was man erwartet. Wenn Du von 0 auf 100 viel ändern willst, dann brauchst Du eine Revolution. Dafür hast Du aber nicht genügend Leute, die das mitmachen also muss Du das in Schritten machen. Bei vielen der von mir weiter oben genannten Schritte hättest Du im Endeffekt sogar schon Mehrheiten im Volk.

Dafür braucht es DIE LINKE. Es brauch eine starke LINKE um zumindest positiven Druck zu machen. Natürlich ist das kein Allheilmittel. Ohne eine starke Linkspartei in den Parlamenten wird sich aber gar nichts zum Guten ändern.

EDIT:

&gt; Es müssen ALLE mitmachen. Änderung muss von unten kommen!

Und wie lange willst Du darauf warten? Das wird auf absehbare Zeit nicht passieren. Ich habe lange genau so gedacht und ich stelle fest: Es war verlorene Zeit. Bei großen Veränderungen machen **nie** alle mit. Kleine Veränderungen sind das Einzige was Du demokratisch hinbekommst,

EDIT-2:

&gt; Der Glaube, Verantwortung an einige wenige ""da oben"" abgeben zu können, funktioniert nicht.

Dann mach doch mit. Der Eintritt in z.B. DIE LINKE ist kostengünstig zu haben. Klar, da redest Du dann erstmal über den Spielplatz um die Ecke und das ist nicht sonderlich spannend aber auch das ist Teil vom ganzen und als Mitglied ist es dann an Dir Mehrheiten zu organisieren um die Partei in die Struktur und Richtung zu bringen, die Du für richtig hältst. 

Wie willst Du das sonst machen? Du brauchst immer eine Organisationsform (also letztendlich so etwas wie eine Partei) und in der Organisation wirst Du immer in der Auseinandersetzung mit anderen Deine Meinung vertreten müssen. Das üble an der Demokratie ist halt, dass die Anderen auch mitreden dürfen. ;-)

The new left-wing party *Podemos* decided not to run in these elections, but they supported local platforms like the ones that have won in Madrid and Barcelona. The left-wing regionalist coalition *Compromís* who won in Valencia are ideologically similar, but they were already established before *Podemos* came along.

The other ""new"" party, *Ciudadanos*, didn't win in any major cities, but they've joined many coalitions. Depending on who you ask, they're centre or centre-right, and although they claimed to have nothing in common with *PP* and *PSOE* (social-democrats), they'll be ruling with both of them in some places.

&gt; Muhammad, however, was surprised to see that the Italian authorities took little interest in who these hundreds of migrants were, or where they intended to go.

&gt; “No coast guard, no policeman ever asked if we had papers. Nobody registered us, nobody took a photo of us, nobody took our fingerprints, no one asked us who we were.”

/-/

&gt; Muhammad and the other migrants would soon find that their Italian hosts were no more interested in keeping them there than they themselves were in staying. When Muhammad asked the Italian police at the asylum center if he had to stay there, one said that he was welcome to sleep there, “but if you want to leave, you can leave.”

/-/

&gt; Once in Germany, Muhammad visited the police, asked for asylum, and was registered as a refugee. He now has temporary papers and a room in a refugee center in Berlin.

Et comme argumentaire tu me sors une recherche Google ? Figure-toi que je peux te sortir rigoureusement la même requête pour justifier que la privatisation a été un succès.

Je prends l'article Wikipedia :

&gt; Since privatisation, the number of national rail journeys has increased 84% and the number of passenger-km 88%.  
&gt; [...]  
&gt; Overall, fare increases have been at a slower rate than under British Rail.  
&gt; [...]  
&gt; The railway can point to continued improvements in safety under privatisation; in fact the rate of improvement has increased compared to that experienced in the last years of BR.

Par ailleurs, c'est un des systèmes ferroviaires les plus surs d'Europe.

&gt; For 85 seconds Philae ""spoke"" with its team on ground, via Rosetta, in the first contact since going into hibernation in November.

&gt; When analysing the status data it became clear that Philae also must have been awake earlier: ""We have also received historical data - so far, however, the lander had not been able to contact us earlier.""

&gt; Now the scientists are waiting for the next contact.  There are still more than 8000 data packets in Philae’s mass memory which will give the DLR team information on what happened to the lander in the past few days on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

&gt; Philae shut down on 15 November 2015 at 1:15 CET after being in operation on the comet for about 60 hours. Since 12 March 2015 the communication unit on orbiter Rosetta was turned on to listen out for the lander.

No they are not. Gross wages divided by output show the true costs. Net wages are an excellent indicator for private demand. Of course, you don't like it since when we use any metric that actually matters the Czech Republic wastly outperforms Poland (productivity, unit labor costs, net wages, unemployment, GDP per Capita) which was your original complaint wasn't it? Why do I like the Czech Republic so much more than east European countries? Because it's a better country in any metric that matters. 

&gt; Agricultural subsidies subsidize production, cohesion funds finance investments.

Investment is used to build factories which produce. Don't be silly.

&gt;They aren't. They employ about 5000 people just in one factory!

BMW's total labor costs are 7 percent of revenue. Not sure about FIAT but car production is one of the most automated businesses on the planet. Those 7 percent include engineering, too. So the savings from lowering labor costs by off shoring are marginal. They would not move to Poland if there weren't additional anti-capitalist EU incentives. 

&gt;Really? What about demography? 

Did I miss WWIII? Did the eurozone lose 20 percent of its population recently? Nope. Do we have mass underemployment constraining demand in the eurozone. Yes. 

&gt;Most people in Europe already own more stuff than they use, especially electronics.

In capitalism people throw away old stuff when they want and buy new goods if they have the money.

&gt;You're a communist because you think of labor differently from other productive capital. 

Uh. That's pretty amazing. In capitalism we have both demand and supply. Since ""other productive capital"" doesn't generate demand, labor is actually very different in that people go home and use their **net wages** to buy stuff. 

&gt;these efficiency increases

That aren't efficiency increases since they were caused by EU subsidies and tax breaks. They actually are market distortions, and hence anti capitalist. The EU thinks it knows better than the market and has caused one giant blob of market distortion that calls itself Poland. 

You should read up about the demand side of capitalism. In which your labor costs magically turn into the buyers of your products. This is completely different to your robot, that remains in your factory and doesn't want anything, but a bit of electricity, spares and oil. 

Your problem is that you aren't very well informed. This lack of understanding reads like the bleating of a calve. It's barely coherent. Take my advice and in the future refrain from calling others names, especially when they are much better informed than you are. I know Dunning-Kruger is a bitch and it likely won't help to tell you this, but your thinking that I am a Marxists is rooted in your complete and utter lack of understanding of the subject at hand. Nothing else.

* why frame this on snowden, he hasn't had control of the files since he was in China and he handed them off safely 

&gt;Glenn Greenwald has repeatedly said that Snowden's data was only accessed on air-gapped computers and Snowden himself didn't have the files anymore once he handed them over. There is nothing to ""hack into"".

Essentially they start this whole story with an ad hominem. 

* Even if someone who has the files didn't keep protocol (which I assume would be letting them nowhere near the Internet) AES encryption is unbreakable and would require getting inside the brain of the person with the password. Not the work of *le russkie/chinese hacker threat*

Our government is in a awkward position: refusing to harbor those people would be a death sentence for a lot of them, at the same time we don’t have enough resources to deal with migrants. Moreover, the average Italian is right winged and prone to xenophobia.

Recently I attended a “Citizen Dialogue” at EXPO2015 featuring [Martin Schulz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Schulz) and [Federica Mogherini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federica_Mogherini), they were adamant about the urgency of the problem and stated that **finally** the EU has decided to step in side-by-side with Italy in aiding migrants. At the same time Mogherini outlined how the primary concern is to stop the business behind those migrations: we have to hit hard the smugglers who traffic human lives; it would also be nice to help stabilize the economy of the countries involved as well as to preserve peace: people decide to start a life threatening journey only when desperate and with no options left.

In a more and more interconnected world we can’t ignore problems only because they aren't happening inside our borders: they’ll come get us sooner or later.

First of all your argument could be applied to the EU as it is. You already have, as there must be, positive and negative net contributors. We do it because in the end it created a stronger union and that's better for everyone.

Likewise the system as it is it's deeply flawed and the whole EU is losing from it. Unlike the US who have easily recovered we are currently all suffering from the Greek situation, northerners included.

In a fiscal union, the most disadvantaged would have been taken care of avoiding much of the social drama. The borrowing costs for Greece would be lower because they'd finance themselves via eurobonds. There wouldn't be as much of a political crisis because there would be less creditor debtor conflict within the EU, and everyone would be more focused on actual recovery of the Greek economy. The eurozone would have more fiscal authority over Greece, and more control over where the money goes.

So yes maybe northerners would oppose, but in the end everyone loses.

Also it's good to remember that the world changes. Don't think northerners are immune to their own local crisis. Remember Germany (and France) were the first to violate the stability and Growth Pact. Of course rather than statements of bad bad Germans and subsequent punishment the rules just got changed for them. When something of the sort happens again reactions from the south may be different. Also Ireland isn't south nor is Iceland isn't south.

Edit: Bush's reaction to the tragedy is exceptionally charming:

&gt;The U.S. government issued notes of regret for the loss of human lives, but never apologized or acknowledged wrongdoing.[14] George H. W. Bush, the vice president of the United States at the time commented on the incident during a presidential campaign function (2 Aug 1988): **""I will never apologize for the United States — I don't care what the facts are...

And it is true now. Every potent military has a serious armored backbone. 

&gt;. I have a really hard time imagining a future scenario where tanks will be used for land warfare especially because of the rise of drones and we know that tanks are extremely vulnerable to air attacks, even a group of people or one person can take out a tank with a missile.

Any conventional conflict really. 

The only thing that armed drones have over manned aircraft is the huge loiter time, which is great when you are waiting for some dude to pop his head out of his cave. They operate in environments with literally no threats. In a conventional war with a properly equipped enemy, drones are target practice. They can't last in a high threat environment. 

Small drones for reconnaissance are cool, but they don't make tanks obsolete. In fact, they increase the lethality of every platform. 

Tanks are vulnerable to air attacks, as are any ground formations. That's why there's air defense to protect them. 

Anti tank missiles have existed for decades, and tanks were always vulnerable to them. As the lethality of the missiles increased, so did the protection of the tanks. 

&gt;Ofc, Tanks can be used effectively for invading third world countries that do not posses modern anti-tank equipment... 

And they would be even more important in invading a well equipped enemy.

&gt;I don't see current tanks as viable investment for the future, but that's my oppinion.

Le probleme israelien n'est pas une preocupation directe pour le moment malgre quelques sentiments de haine suite a la guerre de 2006 puisque cette fois tout le liban etait concerne. La seul solution au Liban est une solution politique entre les chretiens, leur division en deux camps paralyse le pays depuis 1990. 


La guerre en Syrie n'est pas une bonne chose, nous somme coupes des voies terrestres, qui sont plus rapides et moins cheres pour le commerce que l'avion et la mer, nous avons une innodation de refugies dans chaque ville, au moins une fois par semaine on doit eteindre une tente ou une dizaine qui ont pris feu, des accidents de route puisque les refugies ne sont pas tous eduques ou pensent trop (c'est la verite) et donc ils traversent l'autoroute et se font percuter, ou sur des motos sans casques. Le pire c'est quand y'a un pont de passage a meme pas 50 metres, la paresse et l'ignorance sont fatales ici. La guerre en syrie en plus renforce les divisions religieuses meme entre les religions, en particulier les Chretiens et les Druzes qui ont une opinion differente sur qui supporter. 


Le contrat d'armes est une farce, on a besoin d'artillerie lourde et d'avions de chasse ainsi que des chars de combat, le plus neuf des chars date des annees 80, le contrat en plus n'est pas pour la livraison directe, c'est une livraison echellonee. J'habite pres d'une base militaire du regiment blinde et des commandos, a chaque fois que je croise un ami ou qu'on part boire un verre (ou dix) ils me disent que ce qu'ils recoivent c'est pas ce qui est adequat. 

Malgre tout on a confiance en cette armee puisqu'elle est laique est impartielle, tous les partis ont une agenda politique exterieure, le camp des 8 Mars est en faveur de la Syrie, Russie, Iran, et le 14, l'Arabie Saoudite, (un peu la france) et les Etats-Unis. Ca se decoupe, 8 shiites, et 14 sunnites, et chretiens et druze divises en deux. 


Aujourd'hui on s'attend au pire, je suis en deuxieme annee de droit et on etudie exhaustivement la constitution, aujourd'hui plus que jamais il faut que l'armee intervienne et prenne le controle du gouvernement, et restaure la vraie democratie et enchaine les reformes executives qu'il nous faut. Je pense que nous chretiens n'avons aucun probleme, ainsi que les shiites malgre leur allegence au Hezbollah, le probleme est avec les sunnites qui pourraient se sentir persecutes par l'armee en raison des anciens evenements a Tripoli (aujourd'hui la ville est liberee grace a eux) et a Arsal. Aussi tenant compte des 1.8+ millions de refugies syriens et 700 000 palestiniens tous sunnites qui pourraient aussi se sentir persecutes, ils ne sont pas tous sage, donc des punitions sont frequentes.

Meine Eltern interessieren sich eher für das Einkaufen jedoch finde ich das langweilig. Sie interessieren sich auch für gute Restaurants weil sie Meeresfrüchte mögen. 

Letztes Jahr bin ich in die Türkei gefahren. Ich war in eine**r** kleinen Stadt die Hisaronu **heißt** und sehr klein und lebendig war. Ich bin für zwei Wochen in einem Hotel geblieben welches aber langweilig, stressig und nicht gut war weil es nur kaltes Wasser gab. Die Reise war schrecklich und hat **z**wei Stunden und **z**wanzig Minuten gedauert. Sie war garstig weil meine Brüder Lucas und Isaac mich im Auto ärgerten und ich deshalb nicht schlafen konnte. Wir haben auch viel in Restaurants gegessen.

Hisaronu ist in der Nähe einer Stadt die Fetiye heißt, an der Westküste der Türkei. Die Leute waren sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Jack war ein Barkeeper im Hotel mit dem ich viel Billard gespielt habe. Es gab auch einen Wasserpark in Fetiye, welcher zwanzig (Dias??? ) hatte. Auf dem Hisonaru Markt gab es viele gefälschte Uhren und Taschen. Obwohl das Hotel nicht so toll war, war es dennoch weniger stressig als zu Hause und ich konnte ~~zu~~ entspannen. 

Mein Lieblingstag war der erste Montag. Tagsüber hatte ich entweder Brot oder Pizza, (kippe ich erinnere mich????), welche fantastisch waren. Dann besuchte ich ein Fußballstadion in Fetye bevor ich wieder nach Hause ging weil ich hungrig war. **E**ine Stunde später ging ich mit meiner Familie auf die Kegelbahn. Wir haben auch viele Geschenke für meine Onkel und Tanten gekauft. 

In der Zukunft möchte ich mit meinen Freunden nach Polen reisen. Ich möchte zwei Wochen in einem Hotel in Hamburg bleiben und dort Ski fahren mit meinen Lehrern Jake und Jane. Mein Freund Tommy besitzt das Hotel in Hamburg welches ein Schwimmbad hat. Das wäre fantastisch, weil ich es mag Zeit mit meinen Freunden zu verbringen.

Mais si on veut faire une distinction précise, je pense que tu trouveras utile le terme [antijudaisme](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antijuda%C3%AFsme)

Pour citer la très bonne mise au point de wikipédia:

&gt;L’antijudaïsme signifie l'hostilité à l'égard de la religion juive. Ce terme peut être employé à propos de l'attitude du christianisme envers le judaïsme, attitude longtemps marquée par la théologie de la substitution, elle-même issue de plusieurs courants, dont le marcionisme et la doctrine augustinienne du « peuple témoin ».

&gt;Au sens strict, l'antijudaïsme ne doit pas être confondu avec l'antisémitisme, bien que tous deux puissent s'influencer mutuellement. L'antisémitisme désigne une attitude hostile vis-à-vis des Juifs en tant que peuple au-delà d'une stricte dimension religieuse. Toutefois, au cours de l'histoire, ces deux notions se sont confondues, ainsi que l'a démontré, par exemple, Jules Isaac dans son ouvrage Jésus et Israël.


comme précisé dans d'autres commentaires, l'anti-sionisme est l'opposition a un projet particulier (l'existence d'un état pour les juifs en terre d'israël), et ne signifie pas nécessairement l'opposition au peuple juif, en particulier tant qu'Israël n'était qu'a l'état de projet, où il y avait une partie non négligeable de la population juive qui était anti-sioniste. Après une fois qu'israël est là, c'est difficile d'être contre l'existence de l'état d'israel sans être aussi contre la présence des juifs en israel, et donc militer pour leur déplacement, leur éradication ou leur annexion.",null,0,null,1434288280,null,0,false,0,cs64rww,null,t3_39oqyv,null,t1_cs64rww,null,t3_39oqyv,null,null,null,1436989356,null,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2,null

Fault isn't something you have to completely assign to one individual. It's not reasonable to say that Snowden's mom is at fault for this because this isn't anything a reasonable person would expect as a consequence of ""Hey c'mere Snowdad let's bone"".

It is pretty reasonable to suggest that anyone who gives documents to journalists (who are not famous for their immunity to bribery or extensive knowledge of cryptography) could be reasonably expected to forsee a situation like this. It doesn't have a whole lot of bearing on whether it was the right thing to do (although it certainly has some), but imo makes sense that you could blame Snowden for this.

Derartige Massnahmen gibt es in zahlreichen kapitalistischen Staaten ohne dass jemand die hahnebüchene Behauptung aufstellen würde, diese seien *kommunistische Paradiese*.

In multiple states, these holes were supposed to be filled, but instead, the funding was diverted.  Students just wanted the fees gone without thinking about who would be picking up the slack or even making suggestions about picking up the slack.  It was a halfway developed idea.  The same student complaining about her parents' vacation was the first one to complain that the library was no longer open on Sundays.  I have also never seen Germans complain about shelling out for an Exkursion in Gymnasium that costs 300-400€ for a week.  I've also seen far too many Exkursionen planned for places like Europapark.  In contrast, 450€ to cover extra benefits for an entire semester is a deal.  (That's definitely my American side talking, though.)

Staff members are afraid to protest because of the increasing number of jobs that work in two-year cycles.  Speak up for something and your contract (which once would have been renewed) suddenly isn't renewed any more.  In many cases, that also means no more PhD, no more Habilitation.

&gt; ""Unless persistent failures of the policy result in a consistent review of all its components, Czechoslovak institutions will very soon reach a situation in which they will face charges of committing a crime against section 259 of the Criminal Code (the genocide act). ... If, in particular, the forced removals of children from Romani parents and sterilisation of Romani women continue as they have so far, no secrecy and no unlawfulness in the area of justice will help avoid the bringing of formal charges founded on evidence.""

[Final Statement of the Public Defender of Rights in the Matter of Sterilisations Performed in Contravention of the Law and Proposed Remedial Measures](http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/ngos/Public-defender-rights.pdf) (JUDr. Otakar Motejl, 2005)

&gt; It is a historical fact that pre-November [1989] Czechoslovakia applied a set of measures against the Romani community aimed at its gradual assimilation into society as it was. These measures included efforts by social services to control the birth rate in the Romani community to stop it presenting a ""social risk"".

Section 4.3.2 of the same report contains direct quotes from several Regional National Committees describing their efforts;

&gt; ""After childbed, mothers are being persuaded to undergo contraception and sterilisation. 18 Romani women were sterilised in the South Bohemian Region in 1978...""

&gt; ""15 Gypsy children were born in our territory in 1978, of which three were with a low birth weight; all the children are alive. In 12 cases termination was performed and sterilisations were performed on four Gypsy women. In all cases the intervention was performed due to a high number of children in the family.""

&gt;In [multivariable calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus), the __implicit function theorem__, also known, especially in Italy, as __[Dini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulisse_Dini)'s theorem__, is a tool that allows [relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_(mathematics\)#Formal_definition) to be converted to [functions of several real variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functions_of_several_real_variables). It does this by representing the relation as the [graph of a function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function). There may not be a single function whose graph is the entire relation, but there may be such a function on a restriction of the [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(mathematics\)) of the relation. The implicit function theorem gives a sufficient condition to ensure that there is such a function.

L'Ukraine qui soutenu par les USA produit un coup pour virer le président (qui n'était pas un saint soit) qui était pro-russe et le remplacer par un homme de confiance des Etats Unis c'est par exemple une action anti-russe. 

Et j'ai vu plus bas parler de désinformation etc, oui la Russie désinforme à fond sur plein de choses mais pas moins que les Etats Unis. La presse occidentale n'a jamais soulevé de doutes sur le fait que l'agression ukrainienne ai eu lieu après des manoeuvres américaines, non ca a toujours été la Russie l'agresseuse et Poutine le vilain terroriste. Euronews et Reuters ont eu des images des massacres de populations civiles par les force ukrainiennes à Donetsk, pour autant ca n'a jamais été repris dans les infos occidentales alors que les images de tanks russes à la frontière on y a eu le droit quasi tous les jours. Le fait que le nouveau gouvernement Ukrainien ai accepté des fascistes ultra-nationalistes (anti-russes à fond) n'a pas non plus semblé choquer beaucoup de monde dans les JT alors qu'on à le droit à des reportages d'habitude dès qu'un parti d'extreme droite gagne des places qq part en Europe.

NATO disparity obviously should worry members of NATO, but seeing as the EU essentially requires it for security, and requires so much help from non-EU nations (Turkey, and then of course the US) worries me about the long term politicial future of the EU.  

If member nations with access to an existing powerful security architecture won't lift a finger for other co-members of the European Union/NATO, which alliance actually matters? 

If the point of the EU is to have a unified trade and political organization, shouldn't it be security *of trade and sovereignty* that's right there at the top of the agenda? 

I'm happy that the US can be relied on, and I'm happy to see nations within the realm of US guaranteed peace, rather than being outside of it....but frankly Western European nations have all the more reason to be guarantors of peace and prosperity in the East.

Ever since independence and before there has been a ""Karelian question"" in Finnish politics. In more modern times it has gone away as a result of Russification of Karelia and the strength of the Soviet Union but in the early part of the 20th century it was an important question. Let me try to explain the importance of Karelia for Finland. Culturally Karelia was seen in some national romantic ways as one of the few regions where true Finnish and Karelian culture exists but then being threathened and oppressed by Russians and Bolshevism. Unfortunately under Putin this Russian threath has re-emerged in a big way but that's another discussion.

When Finland declared independence in 1917, Finland and Soviet Russia found themselves at war. Peace was signed in 1920. At first Finland demanded Karelia to be a neutral or Finnish zone and that the border be drawn like on this map I quickly drew:

http://i.imgur.com/wro9Y1N.png

Geopolitically this makes sense. For Finland our eastern border has always been the one where invasions come from. It's a long border and hard to defend. Securing our eastern border means the survival of an independent Finland. Soviet Russia was not willing to negotiate for entire Karelia but for Repola and Porajärvi which had already joined the Republic of Finland:

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Tarton_rauha.png

Finns traded them for Petsamo that was to be given to Finland already in 1864 but which then never happened. In these peace talks of 1920 Finland failed to gain our goals of a more easily defendable border. 20 years later this proved to be costly as the Soviet Union invaded on our entire border. The Soviet military strategy was though poor, and partly led to the failure of the Red Army, but bloody scary. After the war of 1939-40 our eastern border was even more vulnerable. We lost a chokepoint and defensive fortifications on the Karelian isthmus. Northern Karelia and Lapland were more vulnerable too. Finland was vulnerable. 

After the war the Soviet Union continued to be aggressive; they demanded more land in South Karelia than was agreed to in the peace deal, demanded mining rights in Petsamo, denied Nordic plans of a military alliance, denied Finnish-Swedish alliance, annexed the Baltic republics in June of 1940, made demands on our internal matters including who can form the cabinet with which ministers, massed troops on our borders and planned a new invasion to begin in late 1940. In late 1940 and early 1941 the military wanted to mobilise the army because of Soviet troop movements but the government refused. It was tense in 1940. As a result Finland approached the only power which could oppose Soviet imperialism and could help us gain our land back, Germany, and signed a treaty where German troops could use Finnish soil to reach Norway. The Soviet Union negotiated with Germany and demanded that the Soviets could invade Finland in November 1940 without Germany interfering as agreed in the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and as happened in 1939. The Germans refused. Allying with the Germans saved us from another invasion in 1940 that, with the border so vulnerable, would have led to the occupation and annexation of Finland to the Soviet Union. 

With German help in 1941 Finland could now seek to gain more easily defendable borders in Eastern Karelia also freeing the Karelian people of the Russian threath. Finnish military strength wasn't great enough to gain the borders as drawn in the first map I posted but still we gained river Svir (Syväri) and a more easily defendable buffer zone. To me it's not realistic to expect Finland to stay ""neutral"" and quiet after the war of 39-40 with a huge imperialist neighbour to the east. Finland had a chance to solve the geopolitical challenges it faced and still faces when it comes to our eastern border but failed as Germany failed. I expect Finland to pay the ultimate price for this somewhere in the future with a Russian occupation/annexation.

Beaucoup d'élites russes, y compris Vladimir Poutine, ont une perception du temps long que les Européens et les Américains n'ont peut-être plus. La question demeure complexe : faut-il accorder plus d'importance aux états d'âme russes, humiliés depuis plusieurs décennies et nostalgiques d'une gloire désormais révolue, ou *a contrario*, respecter les choix pris par des nations souveraines depuis leur émancipation dans les années 1990? Peut-on vraiment blâmer les anciens pays communistes de s'être rapprochés de l'Occident, au point d'avoir intégrer contre lesquelles ils luttaient, et ce, malgré la promesse de Washington de ne pas s'étendre à l'Est?

&gt; Sans doute le retour à la guerre froide et le réarmement qui ira avec font-ils espérer une meilleure reprise de la croissance, et les Américains sont bien prompts à montrer leurs muscles de ce côté-ci du monde, quand ils se cantonnent quasiment au rôle de spectateurs dans d'autres lieux, où leur intervention aux côtés de la France aurait pu être appropriée.

La situation actuelle n'a rien à voir avec la Guerre froide. Le contexte et les rapports de force sont fondamentalement différents. En 1945, les Etats-Unis et l'URSS étaient les grands vainqueurs de la guerre, se disputant bientôt les ruines de l'Europe. Roosevelt et Staline se comprenaient (les choses changèrent assez vite avec Truman). Aujourd'hui, nous avons une puissance hégémonique, certes en perte de vitesse, mais c'est à relativiser ; une puissance déclinante et affaiblie, tant économiquement que démographiquement, ou militairement ; et surtout, une Europe structurée et clairement tournée vers l'Atlantique. Les pays d'Europe de l'Est ont des économies florissantes, tirant pleinement profit de leur intégration dans la mondialisation. Ils sont dans les meilleures dispositions pour choisir leur propre voie.

Le réarmement, s'il survient, ne concernera probablement qu'un des camps. La Russie est affaiblie économiquement. L'embargo européen, la chute du rouble, la dépendance à ses exportations énergétiques mettent Moscou dans une situation délicate, et difficilement soutenable à long terme. La Russie semble d'ailleurs s'orienter vers une asymétrisation de sa doctrine militaire, avec le déploiement de forces irrégulières, de frappes préemptives et surtout, avec le recours à la cyberguerre. Lancer une cyberattaque contre les sites estoniens (2007) ou géorgiens (2008) est infiniment moins coûteux sur tous les plans que le déploiement de blindés.

Les Etats-Unis, de leur côté, reposent sur un complexe militaro-industriel, hérité de la Guerre froide, qui s'est déjà tourné vers l'avenir. Le secteur de la cyberdéfense va décupler d'ici 10 ans, pour peser près de 700 milliards de dollars dans l'économie américaine. La croissance est assurée dans ce domaine,  en atteste l'évolution du NASDAQ au cours des dernières années. La robotisation et la déshumanisation de la guerre est un objectif clairement affiché par Washington. La doctrine Obama est celle d'une ""*guerre zéro mort*"" et d'une dissuasion croissante. Je pense qu'elle peut être comparée à la doctrine des représailles massives : quand la situation l'exige, il n'hésitera pas à agir en conséquence, peu importe la manière. Il faut ajouter à cela l'indépendance croissante des Etats-Unis face à leurs importations énergétiques : ils sont pratiquement autosuffisants pour le gaz et le pétrole grâce au schiste.

The sterilisation was well defined medical procedure with some preconditions (e.g. 2x Ceasarean cut), it also required written consent from the woman. Small money (1-2 average monthly salary) were granted as relief and that's why many gypsy women asked for this procedure. A gynecologist shared a funny story how one woman came to his office with such a request. He discovered she was sterilized before but needed money and thought this is the easiest way.


Few decades later pro-gypsy activists looked for something to legitimize their existence. They found about sterilisations and for them it was like a gift from heavens. They convinced gypsy women to lie about everything with promise of getting much more money. These lies were recorded as true word from the God and  spread wide and far.

From the moment euro was introduced, NBG (as all national banks in EZ) does not represent Greece, it represents ECB and their interests, it is purely political and not independent; that is very clear from the EU treaties. The banks interest do not equal the Greek people's interests, I think that is quite clear by now, when banks in EZ have taken hundreds of billions of the taxpayers free and unconditionally.

&gt; Syriza has two economists: Varoufakis and Lapavitsas, the later being a drachma proponent. Both agree on one thing: returning to the drachma will be very very painful.

That is obvious. Noone can really question that, there will be pain. Greece does not have easy choices. The difference is that one way can show hope and perspective while the other is simply dead end and there is absolutely no hope.

&gt; LOL, the currency will float to a point that reflects Greek production (which is shit at the moment). Industry needs years to build the infrastructure and start pumping products. Setting the exchange rate instead of letting the market decide, always leads to black market currency and lack of imported goods. Venezuela says hi!

But euro does not represent Greece's economical situation. That's the whole point of why internal devaluation happened and in the end ...didn't even work. Greece's currency would surely be devalued to reflect the economy. That's not a bad thing. That's how it was pre-euro, drachma was a weak currency and we lived just fine.

There is only one serious research paper yet on what happens if Greece leaves the euro. [Here](http://www.theo-mariolis.gr/files/gr/Publications/arthra/Thirwall%20Model_Greece.pdf).

null,false,VorisBian,ZBSVUE,U-E,null,"&gt; Je comprends pas trop la question puisque c'est assez explicite. C'est un gouvernement dont le but est d'empêcher la croissance russe que ce soit économique, militaire ou même de diminuer l'influence que peut avoir la Russie dans le monde. Si tu veux des exemples, les Etats-Unis par exemple font tout pour diminuer la puissance de la Russie et son influence dans notre monde, et presse ses alliés à faire pareil (la France qui annule la vente de ses mistrals et du coup se retrouve bien con avec ses 2 bateaux inutiles et des milliards de manque à gagner plus dette c'est pas anodin). L'Ukraine qui soutenu par les USA produit un coup pour virer le président (qui n'était pas un saint soit) qui était pro-russe et le remplacer par un homme de confiance des Etats Unis c'est par exemple une action anti-russe.

Jusqu'à récemment, les Etats-Unis considéraient la Russie comme un partenaire fiable et nécessaire. Moscou était invité aux sommets de l'OTAN, où existe d'ailleurs une commission dédiée aux questions russes. L'intervention en Irak (2003), puis celles en Géorgie (2008) et en Libye (2011) ont profondément affecté les relations bilatérales. La confiance n'existe plus, alors qu'elle est essentielle. La méfiance règne, et je pense d'ailleurs que la rupture du dialogue est une erreur. Le G8 n'aurait jamais cessé d'être le G8 pour devenir le G7. L'ostracisation d'un partenaire donne rarement des résultats positifs.

Aujourd'hui, Washington s'intéresse davantage aux questions asiatiques qu'aux questions européennes. S'il existe une stratégie d'endiguement, elle concernerait davantage la Chine que la Russie. Le renforcement des alliances américaines en Asie (Corée du Sud, Japon, Taïwan, ASEAN, etc.) et les discours belliqueux de la part du Congrès montrent clairement que la Chine est la menace n°1. L'influence russe à travers le monde diminue d'elle-même : en Europe orientale et dans le Caucase, où le modèle européen est plus séduisant ; et en Asie centrale, où Pékin s'investissant davantage pour sécuriser ses approvisionnements en terres rares. Les interventions russes en Ossétie et Abkhazie (2008), puis en Ukraine, sans oublier l'agression contre l'Estonie en 2007 montrent clairement la volonté de maintenir la puissance russe seulement à travers son *hard power*, puis que son *soft power* ne fonctionne plus. La Russie est un pays magnifique, avec une culture extraordinaire, mais je pense qu'aujourd'hui, le Chinois est beaucoup plus étudié que le Russe.

La décision française d'annuler la vente de ses Mistrals a été demandée par l'ensemble des membres de l'Alliance, et en particulier, par les pays Baltes. La Russie et les Etats-Unis sont des partenaires militaires réguliers : Moscou importe énormément d'armements américains chaque année [par exemple](http://armsglobe.chromeexperiments.com/).

&gt; Et j'ai vu plus bas parler de désinformation etc, oui la Russie désinforme à fond sur plein de choses mais pas moins que les Etats Unis. La presse occidentale n'a jamais soulevé de doutes sur le fait que l'agression ukrainienne ai eu lieu après des manoeuvres américaines, non ca a toujours été la Russie l'agresseuse et et Putin le vilain terroriste. Euronews et Reuters ont eu des images des massacres de populations civiles par les force ukrainiennes à Donetsk, pour autant ca n'a jamais été repris dans les infos occidentales alors que les images de tanks russes à la frontière on y a eu le droit quasi tous les jours. Le fait que le nouveau gouvernement Ukrainien ai accepté des fascistes ultra-nationalistes (anti-russes à fond) n'a pas non plus semblé choqué beaucoup de monde dans les JT ...

On peut difficilement occulter le fait que la Russie a déployé des troupes en Ukraine, ce que les Occidentaux n'ont pas fait jusqu'à présent. Quant aux liens avec la droite nationaliste anti-russe, j'ai presque envie de dire pourquoi pas. Loin de moi l'idée de défendre cette stratégie, mais si les Etats-Unis soutiennent vraiment ces groupuscules, ce n'est guère plus choquant que l'alliance avec l'Arabie Saoudite ou le Pakistan. Le crédo des services de renseignement depuis toujours est le suivant : ""*L'ennemi de mon ennemi est mon ami*"". N'oublions pas que le Bloc occidental soutenait des dictatures sanguinaires pendant la Guerre froide, au nom de la guerre contre le communisme. C'est finalement un prolongement de cette doctrine.

Concernant la désinformation occidentale, elle est en tout cas moins choquante et moins scandaleuse que la désinformation russe, où la manipulation d'images est parfois digne de Fox News à ses meilleures heures.

I agree.

For me, as a german, that is a very difficult topic.
First of all what i'am writing now is fully personal opinion with no political or military background at all.
And i would like to get some kind of respond to what i will write later on, because this all makes me really nervous.

Let's assume for a moment that the Russians really wane go full in and try to annex part's of the EU. I think by this time all mayor European Country's like UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Poland ... will shift mayor parts of its industrial and media industry into war mode. And if so, it will be game over for Russia, because USA and mayor parts of the EU fight a long side together against Russia. By this time the Atomic threat will be so real that the whole war would perhaps switch to an Cold War i guess.
I also thought to prevent us all from this kind of scenario, we (excluding germany) build this atomic weapons to scare each other off so much. I hate thinking in this kind of dimensions of War. I would write much more but you know english is kind of complicated, so i will stop now.

I actually got two employers, resto-in and deliveroo. I tried applying for a more classic bike-messengering company but they only take 'experienced' bikers.  
The other companies in Paris that comes to mind and offer the same service are :
take eat easy , tok tok tok (not technically food delivering, a more intriguing concept, look it up) , le zeste, foodora.

~~Most~~ All of the deliveries are food, the client picks a restaurant and a menu from a restaurant in a 4km radius around his place, you get a notification telling you to go there to pick it up.  Tips are very common (about half of all the deliveries in my sector) and can range from the usual 2€ coins to some 10€ sent via the app.

Some pays at the hour (from 7 to 9€/hour) with some smaller pay for each delivery (2 to 4€). Others pay (relatively) big for each delivery (4 to 6€) but give no hourly pay. For every hours expect on average from 10€ to the new sectors (where a few numbers of people and restaurant have the app) up to 25€ (dense inner sector where the app was deployed first + tips).

Some, like resto-in, allows you to do the job anytime, just turn on the app and connect, and wait for a delivery, usually I could get 2 / 3 delivery an hour. The flexibility might interest you.
Others like Deliveroo are based on a schedule set in advance. Im focusing on deliveroo right now because I needed the discipline to go there and only come back home late at night (things I usually just gave up on with resto-in). Deliveroo being kinda new there's still some 'void' hours where you'll just sit doing nothing (pick up a nice café or bench and read something, at least you're paid on the hour with them). You need to decide what your weekly schedule will be beforehand, and stick to it, but the managers being very nice you can change it anytime, remove days if you can't, add some anytime if you've got some free time etc.
I work at least 19 hours a week right now, as Im still studying on the side, with the hollidays coming up and my endurance building up I hope I'll be able to maybe double this rythm by the end of summer (seems dubious as every day off I get is very welcomed, sore legs etc.).  
Another bonuses, as your performance affects your pay, you're more set to focus on what your eat and do to your body. This job 'forced' me to stay off cigarettes for good, I rarely drink on the week-ends anymore, keeping of junk-food is easier, and I indeed needed the exercise. 
What kind of bike do you have ? I've seen it all with my coworkers, from the single-speed to the mountain bikes. The most common one being a normal road bike with gears. Mine is a road bike with internal gear hub (as to avoid any derailing / change speed when stopped / disc-brakes). I got it for 120€ at a local bike workshop in Clichy ('atelier participatif'), they taught me (and still are teaching me) the usual bike maintenace and repair knowledge, it's worth it if there's on in your area as you'd constantly want to check up / repair / improve your bike (I know I do :D).
Right now EVERY one of those companies is hiring, for both resto-in and Deliveroo I thought they're would be some sort of interview but it was just a meeting with all the other applicants to sign the contract, just go on their website, check indeed.fr (and type in 'coursier a vélo, paris'), or call them.

* Russia's economy seems to be picking back up, due to rising oil prices
* The B~~R~~IC countries failed to follow up with their own sanctions, reducing the efficacy of EU-US sanctions
* The EU and the US are *already* considering a reduction in sanctions (she singles out Greece and Italy expressing doubt over the sanctions)
* Isolation, in general, rarely works (she uses the cases of Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Burma, Libya and Sudan)

Her proposed solutions to *avoid* failure:

* ""Western leaders should offer a hard-headed, compartmentalized relationship where, issue-by-issue, the West and Russia will cooperate where possible and confront one another where necessary""

* Upgrade the defenses of eastern European NATO states

* Help Ukraine's government ""govern, rebuild its economy and defend itself""

* Mobilize the B~~R~~ICs against Russia's behavior

* Maintain sanctions against *specific* individuals and corporations

So, despite the title of her article, she does not *entirely* preclude the use of sanctions. She just says they're not sufficient conditions.

Ce que je souligne c'est que justement malgré tout cela les médias etc se focalisent beaucoup plus sur la Russie que sur la Chine ou les relations entretenues par les USA avec l'Arabie Saoudite.

On s'inquiète davantage d'une menace à nos portes, plutôt qu'à un hypothétique danger à l'autre bout du monde. C'est la loi du mort-kilomètre appliquée aux relations internationales. On se focalise beaucoup plus sur la Russie parce qu'en cas de conflit, nous serons impliqués militairement du fait de l'OTAN. Et dans la mesure où la France est la dernière véritable puissance militaire en Europe, avec le Royaume-Uni, nous paierons sans nul doute le prix fort d'un conflit avec la Russie.

L'Arabie Saoudite nous inquiète moins tant qu'elle nous achète des armes et nous fournit du pétrole. Le parallèle est intéressant avec la Russie : Moscou est devenue menaçante lorsqu'elle a commencé à utiliser le pétrole et le gaz comme une arme politique pour faire pression sur ses petits voisins européens. Les saoudiens ont fait peu ou prou la même chose à travers l'OPEP en 1973, mais lorsque la révolution iranienne est survenue, ils ont arrêté de déconner. Les choses risquent néanmoins de changer s'ils décident de se procurer l'arme nucléaire.

&gt; On continue de nous présenter la Russie comme étant le principal danger et justement je reproche qu'on ne montre jamais le dessous des agissements russes c'est à dire pourquoi la Russie en arrive la...

Ce serait trop compliqué. On préfère inviter BHL pour nous parler de l'Ukraine, plutôt que des spécialistes de la question russe. Seule l'émission 28 Minutes d'Arte a proposé quelque chose de différent ces derniers mois, en invitant une enseignante de l'Université de Rennes 2 pour analyser la politique russe. Une malheureuse exception dans le paysage audiovisuel.

&gt; Pour la vente d'armes aux russes justement la France passe pour le bon petit con de service en annulant la vente quand nos ""amis""eux continuent les contrats militaires car hein faut pas déconner quand il s'agit de se faire de l'argent les USA ne vont pas s'arrêter sur des questions de principe.

It is not MY fault because I have done absolutely NOTHING to contribute to their way of thinking. I have many Roma friends. I grew up in a predominantly Roma neighborhood. If I choose, I can walk their walk and talk their talk. I understand them. 


They will come around, but not forcefully because their are not obedient by gene and culture. They are resourceful and quick to react to circumstances. Forcing them out of their ways will never work. Letting the door opened for them to better their lives through work anytime they choose and focusing on the overall bettering of the society while respecting the word of law and not giving them leeway in this direction will slowly but surely convince them to abandon their ways, through each generation.

En plus c'est pareil que le désherbage manuel, quand il y a des ronces ou des mauvaises herbes, elles repoussent chaque année, le roundup est loin d'être un produit miraculeux et il met du temps à agir. Les gens se croient civilisés parce qu'ils ont un jardin impeccable, j'espère qu'ils vont apprendre à planter ce qui convient au sol, à l'exposition, etc., et à tolérer certaines plantes qui pour être sauvages n'en sont pas moins jolies.

Cela dit dans ma région beaucoup préfèrent de loin acheter dans les coopératives agricoles et les pépinières, plutôt qu'en grandes surfaces. Et j'espère que l'interdiction vaut pour tout le monde, et que tout le monde sera à égalité.

 Its unfortunate that Romani/Roma  sounds so similar to Romanian which i think it is why so many ignorant  people mix the two. Even combine the two.

  Other countries have gypsies and people differentiate between  the gypsies and people from that country such as  Italy, Greece, France, Bulgaria.

My point is that the gypsies in those countries are not European/Slavs ethnicity but of indian ethnicity - even if their nationality is Bulgarian, Greek, Romanian etc. 


I wonder if there is a difference between Romanian gypsies and say gypsies from other european countries - we hear a lot about  Romanian gypsies coming to the UK but not so much of greek, italian gypsies coming here to the UK.  Our media here focuses on the Romanian gypsies.

I think most people think that gypsies are discriminated against (and they may be)  - until they have experiences living near gypsies.   Then they understand why local communities act the way they do towards gypsies.

Your English is *so, so* much better than my German, I assure you.

I guess it kind of comes down to what being ""European"" is going to mean for the European Union, if that's going to be the political body of a unified Europe.

Is it just a financial club? 

Equality in that club is clearly broken, despite a shared currency.

Is it a trade club? 

By export and import, the US, China, and Russia are more important to Germany than many EU nations.

Russia and China figure higher than EU nations for *Poland* as well.

Is it a political union, like, in terms of domestic policy?


That might work insofar as the 'easy' stuff, but on issues like gay marriage, there are strong East West divides. 

On immigration and refugees, the dysfunction is even worse than in the US between our liberal states in the northeast and West (long a haven for illegal immigrants) and Southern states whose electorates are being changed by demographic shift brought on by massive immigration, not all of it legal.



I don't think Russia would dare attack a NATO member outright.

Even if Turkey isn't part of the EU, there's no way war will come to them from Russia; article 5 would be invoked.

As for nations which *aren't* NATO, or EU; one need only look at Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine.

As for EU nations which aren't NATO partners....that's the ambiguity; will EU nations rush to defend them? 

And will they be doing so as NATO partners? 

Will their potentially coming under attack by Russian aggression as a consequence involve NATO? 

And will EU expansion simply now halt because of Russian aggression? 

Obviously Ukraine and Georgia and Moldova can't really join NATO now....but their EU membership, financially, has been killed too - - and Ukraine was *going* to join the EU; what does it mean if the EU won't do shit about them being invaded? 

I don't know whether EU/Eurozone/NATO membership is some kind of talisman against Russian aggression, but it should concern ""Europeans"" *whatever that identity is supposed to mean* that pretty obviously it's membership in NATO, carried almost entirely by the US, that ultimately protects any kind of civil system and currency union they want to have.

That's simply not sustainable, unless the EU/Eurozone wants to invite:

1) more and more US involvement in their trade situation:

https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/39pu5m/the_united_states_house_of_representatives_on/

2) invite vulnerability in the future

If there was ever, and hopefully it won't happen, a US-China war on our Pacific front...

....we simply *wouldn't* be available to really help Europe in a significant capacity during it, or for a time after if whatever ""Europe"" is (culturally, politically, or by currency union) were under threat from Russia.

I am not sure what more first-hand experience I could have except being Roma myself. I live in a city where there are a lot of them and interact with them regularly.

I am not saying that they should be forced into something. But they should be offered incentives, even above the level of what you are offering ordinary citizens. There are usually no more than 1%-2% of them and affluent European societies can afford to treat them well. If they abuse some of that aid - well, so what? They still use it to live better.

Waiting for ""ambitious Roma"" to lift themselves out of poverty by their bootstraps is a very American approach. ""Yes, we should keep them poor because that will encourage them to look for ways out of poverty"". Hogwash. Give them aid, don't treat them as second class citizens and slowly something will begin to change.

&gt;In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), the __Riemann series theorem__ (also called the __Riemann rearrangement theorem__), named after 19th-century German mathematician [Bernhard Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann), says that if an [infinite series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_series) is [conditionally convergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditionally_convergent), then its terms can be arranged in a [permutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation) so that the new series converges to any given value, or [diverges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_series).

- **A group of immigrants has been forcefully evicted several times this week in Paris.** 

Each time, they were sent either to overcrowded and filthy centers or to hostels but only for one night: after that, they went back on the streets or in a community garden... were they were evicted again. 

The media keep reporting it as follow ""They were offered accomodation, but it's them who refused to stay there. Their demands for asylum were registered, but many of them don't meet the criteria: they are economical immigrants looking for a better life, not refugees escaping wars."" ... Actually we don't have the true informations about that, a lot of them seem to be Eritreans or Syrians.

**Another group of immigrants are stuck at the french-italian border**.

 They say they want to cross the frontier and apply for asylum in France, Germany, the UK or Sweden. But the french police is preventing them from moving.



- **A disturbing video showing Vincent Lambert, a 38 year-old tetraplegic man in a 'vegetative state' since 7 years, has been released** by the part of his family who wants to keep him alive. 

This is a case that has been going on for years. His parents oppose his ""right to die"", while the rest of the family - his wife and nephew mostly - say he had expressed a wish to die in case something like that would happen to him. 

Last week the European Court of Human Right ruled in favour to upheld his life support (ie: 'passive euthanasia', according to the french law, since 'real' euthanasia itself isn't legal in France). That was the last possible judicial appeal for his parents after the case went to several courts during the last 5 years or so.

In the video, we can see Vincent Lambert on his hospital bed, moving his eyes and mouth while 'listening' to his mother announcing the decision of the european court over the phone (held by a friend). Doctors say this is a manipulative video, since these movements are just reflexes. Basically his brain is dead. 

Also, of course some french media broadcasted the video without blurring the man's face, although it's of course illegal - he can't give his consent - and they should know it if they had studied ethics for 2 seconds. But they happily showed the video anyway. Unsurprinsing.



-**Former IMF director and ex-future-french-president Dominique Strauss Kahn has been  acquitted in the Cartlon case: he's not a pimp**.

The case was about him receiving prostitutes as gifts from local people in the north, interested in being friends with him in case he ended up President. The court ruled that DSK didn't know the women were prostitutes. Only one person was convicted: a dozen of people were acquitted, no one knew that they were prostitutes, that was not a attempt at corruption through sex services.

-**Controversy: PM Manuel Valls  took his falcon jet plane to assist to the final of Champions League with his kids in Berlin last weekend.**

At first he brushed it off, but later this week he acknowledged this was a ""mistake"" and announced that he would be paying 2,500 Euros for his kids.

He even said he went there to meet Michel Platini and have a professional discussion about next year's European cup.( Confirmed by Platini but false of course). And another socialist said he went there ""because there are always CEO members and we need to talk to them to ensure we are chosen to host the olympic games"". They are stupid. Or rather: they think we are so stupid.



-**Jean-Marie Le Pen has been  ousted from his position of leader of the party**, following the (latest) anti-semitic controversy a couple of months ago.

(But the same day, Jean-Marie Le Pen took it to court to oppose his suspension from the National Front Party. The judgment will be announced in early July I believe.)


- **Three 15 year-old teenagers killed and another one heavily injured yesterday: they were apparently fabricating explosives or smoke grenades to play airsoft.**

It was hot yesterday, which might be one of the reasons things turned out dramatically.

That shootdown you linked to seems like a missile error/operator incompetence.

Russian-trained/aided/integrated Ukrainian rebels (perhaps even Russian servicemen, I don't know) *intended* to shootdown the aircraft they shot down; they just had mistaken it's actual identity.

Then again, it's hard to reduce every kind of incident like this down to the reasons for it happening or intent or whatever - - there's too much that gets anticipated in the aftermath and excused.

I think it's more clear what you mean here if you word it as ""the US has 63% of the EU's population"". I knew what you meant, haha, but if I didn't know I might have interpreted it as ""the EU's population is 33% of that of the United States""

&gt;But the main reason is the US has huge income inequality. In the US, the top 10% earns 73,1% of the wealth. While in Denmark, the top 10% only earns 20% of the wealth. The Walton family in the US earns as much as the bottom 130.000.000 people in America.

The US has a ton of income inequality, but *if you're well-educated in the US*, you'll probably [make a fair bit of money](http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm). Median weekly income for someone with a bachelor's degree in the US is $1,101 ($57,252 yearly); for a master's degree, it's $1,326 ($68,952), and for a doctorate, it's $1,591 ($82,732).

[The OECD measure of household net adjusted disposable income (i.e. after paying for things like food/housing/healthcare/etc) tells a similar story.](http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/income/) Average net adjusted disposable income for the bottom 20% of the US population is $11,194 per year, but for the top 20%, it's $91,638 per year (vs. $8,496 and $54,313 per year OECD average).

This is not one of the ten godly commands of Mozes to live by. Most people aren't solidary with Europe, and that's their choice, thus you better start coping with that.

Well yea, because it isn't my problem. Your problem is having to live with people that are not the same as you. You better start coping with that, that's an attitude few can tolerate.

Politicians in other EZ member-states can't argue in favour of the stuff that amateur suggests without their own parties going down in flames in the next elections, especially in Portugal, Spain and Ireland.

He has suggested several smart techniques for a debt restructuring like intricate swaps, perpetual bonds etc. I disagree that Varoufakis is amateur and irrational as media are portraying him in a blatant character assassination. One has to actually look at his proposals which are actually quite sensible corroborated by well-known economists. Characteristically, Stiglitz in a recent presentation with Schauble and Varoufakis in US, was praising Varoufakis as sensible while when asked about Schauble he answered ""Schauble is... well... I don't want to talk about that"". 

I completely agree though that the problem is political because strictly economically creditors' proposal is insane.

&gt; As for Syriza, it is as in bed with special interests, such as unions, as the old parties where. 

Syriza could very well be in bed with special interests, I am not sure whether that will turn out to be true or not, time will tell.

In my opinion though, unions shouldn't be considered inherently bad as they are simply increasing the bargaining power of workers. What needs to be stopped is the corruption of the union leaders. 

&gt; It also lacks the institutional clout in terms of knowledge to get reforms going. Especially after having thrown out the EU task forces. 

Again, Syriza could very well not have the knowledge for the reforms. But there is nothing substantiating that at the moment.

I am not sure where you are referring with the ""thrown out the EU task forces"".

If one single culture is almost all you know, it's hard to even recognize that some culturally determined custom even *is* culturally determined and not universally human. And even if you know that not everyone does things that way, it can be hard to say whether some cultural point is specific to your region, your country, your continent, a certain part of your continent ...

I can think of several reasons that might make Americans especially susceptible to this: They don't seem to travel abroad much (if only because of the sheer size of their country). They speak a language that is not specific to them, so they might not feel that their language has a cultural meaning. Also, the US have such a high profile in the world that if you are not American you are still very likely to hear quite a lot about the US, which means that even if your own social environment is culturally homogenous, you still have (your rudimentary impression of) US culture as a point of comparison ‒ Americans are less likely to hear so much about a single foreign culture.",null,0,null,1434301413,null,0,1434374929,0,cs6acot,null,t3_39p6iu,null,t1_cs6acot,null,t1_cs5d7gk,null,null,null,1436993548,null,7,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,7,null

That's not going to matter forever. Nobody **wants** to do this, but this is a question of necessity, not what we want. If we can't count on some EU members to share the burden during times of crisis, then there isn't much point to their membership. This is one of the issues that will inevitably be on the table during the treaty re-negotiation that's coming.

It's high time that states are obligated to either contribute to the Union, or be demoted to an associate member without any say in EU politics. States cherry-picking what they want to commit to and what they don't, and only exploiting the positives of EU membership can't go on forever. It makes us all weaker, it makes our foreign policy a nightmare to manage, and it kills our ability to both react to and affect global trends.

Les politiques s'étonnent que les gens votent FN (et que les Républicains virent à droite) mais pour faire un court, un migrant qui arrive en Europe/France, il va vivre comme un Roi s'il demande l'asile, va toucher des aides, se faire loger et soigner gratuitement pendant que d'autres travaillent comme des chiens et peuvent à peine se loger, c'est juste dégueulasse.

En plus, c'est pas des BAC+5 qui arrivent, c'est des gens qui ne parlent pas de langue Européenne pour la plus part, n'ont aucune formation, aucune éducation et qui ne sont pas prêts d'abandonner leur religion une fois qu'ils arrivent en France. Et après ils vont se servir du regroupement familial et encore plus de gens non formés/éduqués vont arriver et coûter cher au contribuable (attention je n'ai JAMAIS dit qu'ils volaient le travail des Français, puisque ce n'est pas le cas).

Perso, j'ai pas de solution miracle pour qu'ils arrêtent de venir, et je ne suis ni politicien ni assez intelligent pour proposer une solution; Je vais juste souligner que les Anglais avaient raison je crois, il faut détruire les bateaux directement en Libye avant qu'ils n'emmènent d'autres migrants en Europe.

Im Büro war ich schrecklich unproduktiv, Dienstag kommt mein Zweitbetreuer zu Besuch, also muss ich bis dahin noch eine Präsentation erstellen. Immerhin habe ich meine Gliederung inzwischen soweit fertig.

Gestern war ich dann endlich wieder fliegen.

In realta' e' molto piu' interessante il trend che riguarda innumerevoli marchi europei, anticipati tra l'altro da qualche anno dagli americani, nella strategia di ritiro dalla Cina, poiche' il costo del lavoro e delle materie prime e' aumentato negli ultimi anni e la qualita' spesso e' quello che e'. Molti marchi o ritornano in patria, oppure, si trasferiscono verso altre nazioni come Thailandia, Vietnam, Indonesia, India, Turchia ed est europa.

Best way to make the Russians feel actively threatened - which usually makes them go and throw all at you they have. [Watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ciy5R-tLiE).

&gt; And can you understand that Estonia has no chance against Russia in a war alone since Russia is more than 100 times bigger? 

Estonia also has no chance of survival in a NATO/Russian war. You're a front-line country, you will be wiped out first, more so if you actively harbor a threat. Your best hope is to appear harmless.

&gt;  Are you a child to make such idiotic remarks in regards learning Russian or emigrate? 

You are obviously unhappy with your neighbor. The routes maximizing your happiness are to either adapt or flee, as fighting is not an option - you said so yourself.

Well, so is Belarus, and I don't hear anyone calling on us to defend *them*.

Avoir le droit d'asile en France ce n'est pas automatique. Et en attendant, un migrant vivant en France est un sans-papier. Avec toutes les conséquences et les risques que ça comporte : vivre à la rue (s'il ne connaît personne), être harcelé par la police, finir en centre de rétention (jusqu'à 18 mois) etc.

[Les demandeurs d'asiles n'ont pas le droit de travailler pendant un an](http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/particuliers/F32454.xhtml) , heureusement qu'il y a quelques aides pour les aider à vivre...
Un immigré en situation régulière et qui travaille à le droit à la sécurité sociale, encore heureux puisqu'il cotise !

&gt; En plus, c'est pas des BAC+5 qui arrivent, c'est des gens qui ne parlent pas de langue Européenne pour la plus part, n'ont aucune formation, aucune éducation et qui ne sont pas prêts d'abandonner leur religion une fois qu'ils arrivent en France.

Certains sont diplômés, en fait ça varie énormément selon le pays d'origine. Je renvoie les redditeurs vers [le tableau 5](http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=ip1524#inter5) de cette étude de l'INSEE. 35% des immigrés africains en France n'ont aucun diplôme. Mais 56% des immigrés Portugais non plus. 29% des immigrés africains sont diplômés du supérieur.

Tes délires sur la langue et la religion sont ridicules. Une langue ça s'apprend, une religion, elle appartient à la sphère privée. Tu sembles tous leur attribuer une religion (on se demande laquelle...), comme si être athée et migrants n'existait pas. Ou comme si être croyants et non pratiquant, ce n'était pas possible.
T'as pas osé l'écrire, mais tu voulais sûrement le dire. *Tout ces immigrés sont des musulmans fanatiques voulant instaurer la charia en France.* Beaucoup de migrants à Calais viennent du Soudan, d’Érythrée, d’Éthiopie (je dirais au moins la moitié viennent de ces trois pays)...Des pays majoritairement chrétiens...

&gt; Germany needs a currency at or on par with the Dollar

We certainly profit from a low-rated currency however we could very much live with a 'worse' exchange rate. A few years ago, 1.30$/€ was deemed optimal for our industry. And we certainly did pretty well despite the rate being between 1,40 and 1,50 after 2008. The valuation of a 'northern' euro would be highly dependent on whether france would be part of it or not (however generally france is supposed to lead a possible southern euro). 

The problem is - we could live with a slow increase of the currency, but we could not live with the exchange rates skyrocketing, like it would be the case if we suddenly reintroduced the mark.


&gt; That's simply the end of Germany's exports

We have always exported a lot, even when we still had the mark. Yes, it would decrease (a lot), but it would not be the end of the exporting nation Germany.

In conclusion, you are generally right, however we do not need parity.

null,false,jtalin,EURO,European Federation,null,"&gt; Having children isn't a ""one man effort"". You don't create ""pressure"" for women to have children, but for couples to do so.

Couples don't suffer through pregnancy equally, but I agree the childcare is shared (I didn't mean to imply that it wasn't).

&gt; It's exactly the opposite, you have to provide them the freedom to do so. Currently for many people it's a choice between having a decent standard of living or having children. It shouldn't be like that.

It IS like that by the very nature of childcare, though. 

Childcare takes time, stress and effort even in a perfectly comfortable financial situation. Time that we otherwise spend going out, watching TV, playing games, working out, playing sports, posting on Reddit, getting drunk on weekends, playing board games, having a hobby, working on side projects, and a million other activities that people enjoy outside of working hours is drastically reduced when you have three kids.

Even people that do have kids nowadays end up not being adequate parents because good childcare requires a lot more time and commitment, which reduces the parents' quality of life. And yes, the government can help the parents financially, but not even the government can give them back the TIME that they spent nurturing their children. 

We only have so long to live, and want to make the best of it.

&gt; And it isn't all about the money anyway, same way as we spend money to combat climate change, to ensure the continuity of humans long after we are gone, it is rational for a nation to spend money to ensure the continuity of its people as well.

*Human* birthrate is still going good though (probably a little *too* good). So we're not talking about survival of the human race here. It's mostly first world countries that have a problem, and that, among other things, is what immigration is useful for.

Anyway, I'm more than willing to pay a reasonable amount of money to subsidize childcare. I simply don't believe that such projects can work out in the long term. It's only going to get worse with every generation.

&gt;Exactly. Why should Turks try to help the PKK? Do you guys realize that the PKK is responsible for 40,000 deaths in Turkey? It seems like it's a bit of a joke for you guys. It's like asking the US to help Al Qaeda because ""ISIS is worse than them"". They're both terrorists.

Yeah, because I'm sure the PKK lined up all those 40,000 people and put a bullet in each and every one of them. The Turkish Army in its 30 years of counter-insurgency never once killed a single human being.

PKK aren't ""nice guys"" anymore than Turkish Kurdistan's military dictatorship and its backers were. I don't expect Turkish Nationalists to have a balanced view of the subject anymore than I expect a Kurdish Nationalist to, though.

&gt;By the way Turkey took in 200,000 Kurdish civilians from Kobane to save them from the conflict not including the 2 MILLION Syrian civilians it took in. Where's the God damn appreciation? ""No Turks you go and get killed fighting the ISIS barbarians and we'll watch you from home.""

Thanks for taking war refugees from a city that was less than a kilometre from your border, I guess? 

Don't get me wrong, the refugee efforts of the neighbouring countries in Syria are admirable. 

&gt;If Europeans are really that worried they can take the 2 million Syrians off Turkey's hands since they're not offering any sufficient humanitarian aid

I would be perfectly happy with Europe taking more war refugees from Syria. Considering the millions of them that exist we've taken very few, only in the tens of thousands on a non-humanitarian basis.

Die letzten Berichte etc. habe ich dafür immer um 23:59 eingereicht :D kurz nach Mitternacht habe ich dann nochmal Panik bekommen und schauen müssen ob ich die Arbeit auch wirklich abgegeben habe.

&gt;Ist das schwer zu lernen und was kostet der Spaß (also der Flugschein und dann, wenn man den hat, so'n Tag mit so 'nem Gerät)

Ich würde sagen, dass man die Basics verhältnismäßig einfach lernen kann, schwer wird es, ordentlich zu fliegen. Bei einem Motorflugzeug hilft dir der Motor, aber wenn du die ganze Zeit unsauber fliegst, verliert das Segelflugzeug schneller an Höhe.

Der Preis ist relativ überschaubar, die ganzen Grundkosten betragen so ca. 1000€, je nach Verein und Gebühren. Pro Stunde kostet das Fliegen zwischen 5 und 15 Euro, je nach Verein. Die Schulungsflugzeuge kosten bei uns ca. 7€ pro Stunde, bis zur Lizenz sind es so ca. 30-40h, je nachdem wie schnell man vorankommt. Dazu kommt eine Startgebühr, normal so um die 3€.

Insgesamt zahlen die meisten also zwischen 1000 und 2000€ für die Lizenz, allerdings ist das ja nicht wie beim Autoführerschein dass man immer nur die Routen fährt, die der Fahrlehrer vorgibt, sondern man fliegt schon vor der Lizenz relativ selbstständig wie man will durch die Gegend. 

Wie lange man einem Tag fliegt, hängt von vielen Faktoren ab, darunter das Wetter und wie viel insgesamt los ist. Ich war teilweise schon über eine Stunde in der Luft, gestern waren es insgesamt 15 Minuten (auch wenn das einem viel länger vorkommt und noch Vor- und Nachbereitung dazukommt).

Insgesamt macht es sehr viel Spaß und ich kann es nur empfehlen, es ist was für wirklich jede Altersgruppe (unsere aktiven Mitglieder sind zwischen 14 und 70 Jahre alt) und man kommt an die frische Luft, aber man muss sich bewusst sein, dass es zeitintensiv ist.

Here already lies the error that makes any reasonable discussion impossible. I almost feel like you are trolling, it's just such a ridiculous useless statement.

*Who* is ""Europe"" and who is ""US""? There are hundreds of millions of people in both those places, and interests and benefits are VERY unequally distributed. Entire countries rarely benefit from *anything*. People in the countries do, but you are on such a superficial track...

If you look at ""how would money benefit"", meaning where wealth is located, than certainly you might make a case that wealth would benefit. Given the extremely unequal distribution especially in the US ""it benefits 88% of wealth"" would translate to [""it benefits 20% of the people in the US""](http://www2.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/wealth.html).",null,0,null,1434308715,null,0,1434308957,0,cs6e3y3,null,t3_39owgp,null,t1_cs6e3y3,null,t1_cs552f3,null,null,null,1436996632,null,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1,null

On a des millions de chômeurs et même si une personne immigrée ne ""vole"" pas un travail, et qu'une entreprise le lui donne, et ben ce travail aurait pu aller à un Français. 

Le MEDEF est le premier ravi - ils peuvent faire pression à la baisse sur les salaires. Et ressortir le discours sur ""les Français feignants qui ne prennent pas ces emplois peu qualifiés"". Sauf que c'est faux, avant les ouvriers étaient beaucoup d'origine Française. C'est après avoir fait venir beaucoup de Maghrébins et d'Africains dans ces emplois que moins de Français les ont pris. C'est l'inverse du discours du MEDEF en fait, on ne fait pas venir des immigrés parce que les Français ne prennent pas ces emplois là, les Français assurent moins ces emplois parce que l'arrivée constante d'immigrés dans ces postes les forcent à être minoritaires et tirent les salaires vers le bas. 

D'ailleurs c'est très intéressant de voir comment les médias très politiquement correct tentent d'influer sur l'opinion. Déjà à la télé on nous montre souvent des femmes et des enfants, alors que majoritairement, ce sont des jeunes hommes qui viennent. S'ils s'installent on aura le regroupement familial. 

C'est déjà une bêtise qui a été faite en France depuis les années 60-70. On voit le résultat dans les banlieues. 

Aussi le truc qui m'énerve le plus c'est le mot ""migrant"". Depuis quand tous les journalistes ont-ils décidé d'utiliser ce mot ? J'ai entendu migrant sur toutes les chaînes, mais aussi migrant économique et le meilleur, ""réfugié économique"". Apparemment, venir d'un pays pauvre aujourd'hui c'est être un réfugié économique et il faudrait leur accorder l'asile. On est dans un délire incroyable. Est-ce que les journalistes savent combien de ""réfugiés économiques"" on devrait accueillir si on définit le terme réfugié aussi largement ? 

Ce sont tous simplement des clandestins. C'est le mot qu'on employait avant ce délire idéologique de ""migrant"".

Après évidemment il reste le problème de la culture de la langue, de l'identité, la culture et la religion. L'immigration africaine s'assimile peu, l'écart culturel est plus important.

If I understand Varoufakis proposal correctly, he is proposing that money will no longer be borrowed by the countries directly but rather one common organization on their behalf. The money borrowed by this organization would be backed by all countries, meaning much lower interest rates than the Mediterranean countries are currently paying. However, the trustworthiness of the stronger countries in this fund is diluted because in total of course more is borrowed. As a consequence, those strong countries pay more than they do now.

In addition, all members are responsible for this organization vis-a-vis the creditors. As such, if one country doesn't pay its debts back, the creditors get their money from the others. Those will then have to try and get that money back from the country that defaulted, but as the present situation shows this can be problematic.

In sum, countries like Greece get a better position at the cost of the other countries, much like would happen in case of direct transfers only better hidden.

Birth rates are probably going to level off and remain steady for many generations, and with so many people on this planet this is nothing but a good thing if you care about the *global* situation.

Birth rates will probably naturally pick up again a few centuries down the line, due to simple evolutionary selection (people who just *love* raising a whole football team worth of kids above everything else will keep multiplying despite effective contraception methods being widely available.

Valable uniquement pour un étranger sans papiers. En France on a un truc qui s'appelle le SMIC. Si les salaires n'augmentent pas, est-ce la faute à un trop forte concurrence sur le ""marché du travail"" ou à l'absence de pression de la part des salariés ?
Les immigrés prennent certains travail où il n'y a simplement pas assez de personnes pour les faire en France.

Le lien entre immigration, même très importante, et baisse des salaires n'est pas prouvé.


&gt; Aussi le truc qui m'énerve le plus c'est le mot ""migrant"". Depuis quand tous les journalistes ont-ils décidé d'utiliser ce mot ?

Depuis qu'il correspond à la réalité :

&gt; migrant , nom

&gt;  Féminin
&gt;  migrante.

&gt;   Se dit d'une personne en cours de migration. 

&gt;  Après évidemment il reste le problème de la culture de la langue, de l'identité, la culture et la religion. L'immigration africaine s'assimile peu, l'écart culturel est plus important. 

Intégration ou assimilation, c'est pas un truc à sens unique. ""Tu m'exclus, alors je t'exclus et on vit reclus chacun chez soi"".

Exactly and none of our countries have a choice as well.
Because how the money system is working in the whole world. Money always and only was and is created out of credits and there for interest and debt come with it , in our current monetary system in place. And after a couple of year's the debt of every country (lender of last resort) reaches a point where it is no longer sustainable. In the History many country's faced a debt crisis. And mostly it is solved with inflation, currency change or war. But neither of this options is  a possible option for Greece in the EZ.
The only thing other Country's are able to, is to share the debt of one country between all other country's.
And at the end every country will end up debt piled up until is is not longer funded anymore. It's way more complicated than this but you wane read about look for google:

Regarding your suggestions, I agree and over the past several years I have yet to go to a chain-store or restaurant where a receipt wasn't provided. However, most of the retail outlets are family run businesses. The person sitting at the register is usually the owner, or a family member. There is zero incentive for him to put such a sticker on his register.
Several years ago, the government put policing responsibility on the shoulders of consumers...by incentivizing them with tax breaks for submitting receipts for all consumer purchases at the end of  the year.

Output is unknown, it can only be estimated.   

&gt;Net wages are an excellent indicator for private demand. 

Irrelevant random sentence.  

&gt;Of course, you don't like it since when we use any metric that actually matters the Czech Republic wastly outperforms Poland (productivity, unit labor costs, net wages, unemployment, GDP per Capita)  

Poland has better productivity. Labor unit cost is productivity, it's defined as a fraction of labor cost in output. You are repeating yourself which proves ignorance.  

Net wage is irrelevant. Taxes redistribute demand, not destroy it.  

Czech Republic is a country in an economic stagnation since the breakup of Czechoslovakia. They used to be richer but aren't now. If the trend continues they will be significantly poorer in 10 years. 

&gt;BMW's total labor costs are 7 percent of revenue. 

What's important is the share of their internal cost. If you need one tonne of steel there's nothing you can do about its price, it's external, as long as you aren't a steel producer also. You can choose the cheapest supplier and/or try to reduce the quantity needed, that's it. Internal costs are the only area where you can get efficiency gains.  

&gt;In capitalism people throw away old stuff when they want and buy new goods if they have the money.

A good 10 years old refrigerator has the same efficiency and works as good as a new one. Outside of electronics/IT, progress is almost nonexistent. Even in electronics/IT it has slowed drastically. In 2000 a seven year computer was slower by orders of magnitude from the new one, now it's about 2x-3x.  

Without progress, there's no reason to buy new stuff, as long as the old works.    

&gt;You should read up about the demand side of capitalism. In which your labor costs magically turn into the buyers of your products. This is completely different to your robot, that remains in your factory and doesn't want anything, but a bit of electricity, spares and oil.  

Nobody needs demand per se, what's needed is the payment.  Full automation would just cut human workers out of the economical exchange entirely. Instead, one shareholder of an automated factory would use his part of the profits to buy a thing from some other automated factory. 

Either all workers are going to become capital owners in some way, or total demand will drop due to less buyers. In the case that it drops, the real wealth of capital owners will actually increase. They will get 100% of a smaller production, but in absolute numbers their share will be bigger. Nobody needs 'demand'.  
If you really want demand *in itself*, start selling BMWs to Africans for €1.    

This is all obvious. Your explanations why workers are different are so ridiculous because they're rationalizations. You start with a premise that labor is magically different. That's Marxist.  

&gt;thinking that I am a Marxists  

If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.  

&gt;That aren't efficiency increases since they were caused by EU subsidies and tax breaks  

Exact same job. ~500 km difference. 7x difference in pay. That's how it was before Poland's accession to the EU. A massive misallocation of productive capital (people), which existed because of artificial market barriers.   

How are tax breaks relevant, compared to the scale of that? Subsidies? What about China? The same mechanism played there, only the initial difference was much bigger. There were no outside subsidies in China.  

The whole point of cohesion funds is to kill the misallocation faster, mainly by infrastructure investments. The correction would still happened without them, just in some other way, probably via a much larger migration to the Western countries.

You're only in a position to be a net contributor because of how much EU has invested in the country in the past. And even though net contribution is commendable relative to the size of the country, it's just not very significant to incentivize other EU countries to keep you. If we're talking strictly about material contribution and benefits, of course.

EU and NATO are separate entities. NATO or no NATO, we are still obligated to defend you, because an attack on Estonia qualifies as a violation of EU territory. *You* might expect that US will keep you safe, but the EU has to operate on the assumption that it will have to defend its own territory. 

Don't you realize that you're ONLY a member because of people like me, who believed in a European project and supported constant EU expansion? It's funny how you forget that now that you've progressed economically and socially. There were a lot of people opposed to the eastern expansion back in the day, and they had very, VERY good arguments -- the same kind of utilitarian arguments you're using today.

&gt; The size of our country is entirely irrelevant, if Poland was 30 nation states instead they wouldn't be worth having in the EU? See how ridiculous that sounds? It's like saying picking up a 100 euro note is worth it, but picking up ten 10 euro notes isn't.

It's a silly hypothetical, but let's go with it. If Poland were 30 nations, it's very unlikely that they would all be members of the EU. It would be highly impractical to deal with 30 individual states' economies, and then there's the issue of veto and Council setup. It just wouldn't be worth the trouble, as opposed to integrating a single, unitary state.

&gt; You have no idea how EU works then, it has never been about shared burden, but mutual benefit. As soon as it stops being about mutual benefit, it might as well dissolve.

I think that only illustrates that you're not aware what EU is and how it operates in 2015. It was about mutual trade benefit a few decades ago, but it is something entirely different nowadays.

The greek pension system is unsustainable and an insult to other EU countries. They need to cut the pensions to get to reasonable numbers. IMF and everyone else agreed that the pensions of the 'vulnerable' are untouchable, the pensions in question are the unresonably high ones and the fraudulant ones. The problem is not the people that need their pensions to get by, those pensions wouldnt be cut either way, but because a huge amount of greek citizens profit unreasonably from the pension system, Syriza literally just promised that the people could continue abusing it and thats why they got elected.

There is nothing stopping the greeks from cutting their military budget as well and use that money for other programs. If they dont start to do long overdue changes and face reality, there is no point helping them. If we let them off the hook in this regard we will have the same problem again every 2-3 years because they will continue to ignore the truth. 

Such a deal would be extremely unfair to the citizens of all other EU countries and very easy to capitalize on for anti-EU propaganda, its political suicide for the ruling parties as well since its undefensible to the public.",null,0,null,1434311410,null,0,1434313111,0,cs6fgha,null,t3_39tp1o,null,t1_cs6fgha,null,t3_39tp1o,null,null,null,1436997718,null,-11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-11,null

People are not complaining about this because it's not considered socially acceptable to complain about that in a direct way. But it comes down to the same thing -- at the end of the day, people need a financial incentive to support children, especially in middle class and upper middle class.

In the end, you'll find that the price state needs to pay in order to ""incentivize"" *enough* people to raise *enough* kids to maintain a steady population growth is way too high to be manageable.

&gt; And I never said we were, you should read my post again if you missed what I was talking about.

You're right, sorry.

&gt; Yes, and killing all the poor in the world would solve poverty, but that's a ridiculous solution, isn't it?
Immigration solves population decline, but it doesn't solve ethnic Estonians from dying out.

Actually, killing all the poor would not solve poverty, since lower classes are the ones that carry our wealth on their backs, economically speaking. Killing all poor would end up in a quick and harsh decline in living standards of the current middle class.

As for ethnic Estonians dying out, it's those same ethnic Estonians who will decide whether that's something they care about enough to want to the extent that they want to sacrifice their own quality of life to prevent it. You will decide with your wallets and your votes. 

Speaking from experience, it's easy to be ideologically inclined until there's a law that hurts you as an individual. At that point, people usually decide they're going to follow their own interests instead of national interests. That is, after all, the consequence of liberal tradition and values that prioritize individual freedom and choice.

That's not exactly true, Estonia showed incredible growth even before joining EU, but of course it has helped, but that's the point anyway, isn't it? You invest some development funds for a short while and you'll be receiving back for a long while afterwards. It's an investment, and Estonia has clearly paid off.

&gt; EU and NATO are separate entities. NATO or no NATO, we are still obligated to defend you, because an attack on Estonia qualifies as a violation of EU territory. You might expect that US will keep you safe, but the EU has to operate on the assumption that it will have to defend its own territory.

Most EU countries are members of NATO, so they'd have to defend us with or without EU.

&gt; Don't you realize that you're ONLY a member because of people like me, who believed in a European project and supported constant EU expansion? It's funny how you forget that now that you've progressed economically and socially. There were a lot of people opposed to the eastern expansion back in the day, and they had very, VERY good arguments -- the same kind of utilitarian arguments you're using today.

I don't. The Balkan nations might have seemed shady, but Estonia has been a slam dunk even in the utilitarian perspective all along.

&gt; It's a silly hypothetical, but let's go with it. If Poland were 30 nations, it's very unlikely that they would all be members of the EU. It would be highly impractical to deal with 30 individual states' economies, and then there's the issue of veto and Council setup. It just wouldn't be worth the trouble, as opposed to integrating a single, unitary state.

Isn't that's why there's EP where votes are relative to the size of your population? 

&gt; I think that only illustrates that you're not aware what EU is and how it operates in 2015. It was about mutual trade benefit a few decades ago, but it is something entirely different nowadays. The constant shift of powers in favor of the Commission and the Parliament illustrates that EU is not satisfied with being a glorified free trade deal.

Yeah, you'll see the real shift if the quota thing goes through, the shift is due to increasing mutual benefit in other fields as well, not to give other countries a bum deal.",null,0,null,1434312168,null,0,false,0,cs6fuop,null,t3_39t9ba,null,t1_cs6fuop,null,t1_cs6fgd6,null,null,null,1436998019,null,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3,null

C'est faux relis mon commentaire, quand tu vas dans un secteur en particulier et que personne n'est blanc tous le monde s'appelle Mouloud ou Abdou, parle un Français approximatif et ben les Français se cassent effectivement. 

Ensuite évidemment que même naturalisés ils font pression sur les salaires. C'est tellement évident. Plus l'offre augmente en terme de masse salariale dans un secteur donné plus c'est difficile d'avoir un emploi dans ce secteur. 

&gt; Le lien entre immigration, même très importante, et baisse des salaires n'est pas prouvé.

Et ben si figure toi, il n'y a qu'en France où ces études là ne reçoivent pas de subventions parce que le seul discours accepté par nos élites politiques et intellectuelles c'est celui de ""l'enrichissement culturel"" mais aux Etats-Unis il y a des vrais recherches qui ont montré les effets négatifs sur l'économie de l'immigration Mexicaine par exemple. 

En France on a des démographes comme Michèle Tribalat dans *Les yeux grands fermés* qui en parlent aussi. Sauf que dès que quelqu'un l'ouvre sur ce sujet hautement sensible en France il est accusé ""de faire le jeu du FN"". 

En fait c'est ça le problème français, la gauche a utilisé le FN pour faire les gentils - regardez le FN est une bande de méchants fachos, votez pour nous on est les gentils. Et comme le FN visait l'immigration, et ben les autres n'ont plus osé parler immigration. Quand la droite en parle, on leur demande ""qu'est-ce qui vous différencie du FN ?"" et quand la gauche en parle on dit ""vous n'avez pas peur de faire le jeu du FN ?"". 

Du coup ce sujet fondamental en politique française - les gens en parlent tout le temps - est mis sous le tapis. Le seul angle sous lequel on a le droit de l'aborder est l'angle humanitaire comme si la France n'était qu'un hospice à ciel ouvert. 

La France c'est un peuple, une culture, une langue et des mœurs entre autres. Ce n'est pas un no man's land. Cette immigration massive n'est ni bonne pour notre culture, notre économie, notre service de santé, notre langue, ou même la stabilité politique du pays. 

Sur le mot migrant, certes il correspond à une partie de la réalité - mais une partie seulement. Ce sont des migrants clandestins, ils migrent de manière illégale parce qu'ils croient que l'Europe est un eldorado économique. 

&gt; Intégration ou assimilation, c'est pas un truc à sens unique.

Et ben si justement. C'est à la personne qui arrive de se conformer à la culture du pays. Pas au pays de s'adapter à la culture de l'arrivant. De parler la langue, d'adopter les us et coutumes. Cette phrase dit tellement de choses. Tout le baratin sur l'immigration qui doit être un ""échange culturel"". Ben oui. Bien sûr. La France n'a qu'à devenir un peu l'Afrique. 

&gt; Tu m'exclus, alors je t'exclus et on vit reclus chacun chez soi. 

C'est ce que font naturellement les gens, ils aiment vivre avec des gens qui leur ressemblent culturellement. Quand des groupes de cultures différentes doivent partager un même territoire il y a des tensions. 

C'est à mourir de rire quand même de voir toujours les mêmes conneries. Tu dis *""Intégration ou assimilation, c'est pas un truc à sens unique""* et ça c'est les mêmes conneries que nous a rabâché SOS racisme pendant des années. Sauf qu'ils sont passés de la lutte contre le racisme à la lutte pour ""le droit à la diversité"" c'est-à-dire le droit de ne pas être le même que le Français de base. Du coup on a une population importante en France de ""Français"" diversifiés - c'est-à-dire de personnes qui ont la nationalité française mais qui ne sont pas culturellement français. Et que se passe-t-il ensuite ? Les Français ne veulent pas vivre avec eux, et s'en vont des quartiers où cette population s'installe. Et après les donneurs de leçon dans ton genre viennent chialer sur la mixité sociale. *Dieu se rit des hommes qui déplorent les effets dont ils chérissent les causes*.

&gt; ""La différence est source d'enrichissement"".  

Laïus stupide que tu peux répéter autant que tu voudras ça ne le rendra pas vrai pour autant. Les différences trop grandes entre groupes de populations forcés de partager un même espace mènent aux tensions ethniques, culturelles et religieuses - identitaires en somme.

When I talk about bad parenting in this context, I don't necessarily mean abuse or strictness, I'm mostly referring to parents who pay very little attention to their kids. In fact, sending them to places like the music school is motivated as much by the desire to ""get rid"" of the kids for an extra 2-3 hours a week as it is by the desire for the kid to explore their musical talent. 

Likewise, pampering them and buying them things happens because it's the easiest way to keep a kid ""happy"" and out of your way.

Indeed, and they stay where they would normally stay. The Libyan government already has camps that houses them. We help the Lbyan government with these camps if needed.

The Greek government has already offered in their proposal to slowly eliminate the early retirement programs.  The creditors are demanding more cuts and also to raise the VAT (almost doubling it) on essentials such as electricity.

One of the reasons the pension system is overburdened is because there are simply not enough jobs, and people will resort to the early pension even if it pays much less.  Better some income than none.  Less people working also means less people paying into the system.  This is why stimulus and growth-oriented measures are needed, not just austerity.

First of all, thank you so much. What an awesome answer, there's more info in there than I was hoping for. So here's my situation:
I'm a student and I've been working part time at McDonald's since February, on a 25 hour contract. The job sucks, the pay sucks, the hours suck, it's boring as hell and really exhausting, but in a bad way (you just stand for 10 hours straight, there's just one 30 minute unpaid break). Plus, it's friggin' McDonald's, need I say more?
I love biking, and I'd rather spend my day outside than in a neon-lit kitchen.
I'm in OK shape and have a decent bike (Triban 3, the old red model with carbon forks and Shimano gears), so delivering stuff seems like the ideal job for me.
I'm a little weary of ""earn up to..."" jobs, but if I can earn at least as much as I am with my current job (SMIC/h) - and it seems like you are - then this is awesome.
Anyway, I've just applied at Resto-In, Foodora and Deliveroo, let's see if they'll answer.
A couple of questions if you don't mind:

- How many KMs do you bike on a typical day?
- How important is it to know the city well? I use Google maps on my phone almost every day and find my way just fine, but I don't know many street names.
- Is there a performance benchmark? I.e. are you supposed to have a certain average speed? 

Thanks again!

Kommentare werden gebraucht, und die kann man sicher besser machen als einige im Buch zitierte Beispiele, aber die Trennung von Nachricht und Kommentar ist nicht Vernebelung, Anpassung oder Mutlosigkeit.

Questo ha portato a vari tornei non tenuti negli ultimi dieci anni, dopo una finale sospesa per rissa nel 2007 e la finale dello scorso anno non giocata a causa delle eccessive tensioni a seguito delle semifinali.

Il regolamento è stato quindi riformato responsabilizzando i colori nei confronti del comportamento dei propri calcianti (per chi si rifiuta di uscire a seguito di una espulsione ad esempio ora sono previste multe salate e l'eventuale espulsione dal torneo) oltre a limitare la possibilità di scontri, ammessi solo se uno contro uno e con una durata temporale limitata e solo se accettati da entrambi i contendenti.

Quelque soit la manière dont le migrant arrive sur le sol australien (air ou mer) ou que l'armée accoste ton embarcation dans les eaux territoriales, il va être emmené dans un camps de rétention sur une île (Christmas,  Nauru, Manus, Papouasie-Nouvelle-Guinée). Le migrant ont deux choix principaux, le premier est de rester dans le camps et le second de retourner dans son pays. L'obtention de l'asile est très difficile voire impossible.

Au contraire de l'Europe, l'Australie ne fait pas de différences entre un homme, une femme ou un enfant.

La seule manière d'arriver en Australie pour un migrant est le regroupement familial, un contrat de travail et un visa ou une demande d'asile dans une ambassade. Ces trois cas sont encore soumis à des quotas (même pour le regroupement familial).

These are rather personal questions, so the answers are more believable if you come up with them yourself (and with a month time, translating them shouldn't be a problem). however, here are some pointers:

- Welche Pläne hast du für die Sommerferien?  
What are your plans for summer holidays? Do you go away or stay at home, maybe you'll work a holiday-job.
- Mit Feunden oder mit den Eltern &amp; Geschwistern? Warum [nicht]?  
Who are you planing to spend the holidays with and why?
- Was machst Du bei einem Großstadtbesuch am liebsten? Vielleicht hast Du ein Beispiel?  
what do you do when in a big city? possible answers could be cultural stuff like museums or sight seeing or shopping or clubbing, etc. also think of an example like a museum you'd visit
- Wo bist du schon einmal in D, A, oder CH gewesen?  
Ever been to germany, austria or swiss? tell them about where and what you experienced there.
- Was macht Deutschland zu einem beliebten Ferienland?  
this one is a bit more subjective, i'd suggest talking about landscape (alps, forests, north- and east-sea) and culture (historic cities, castles, etc.)
- Aktivurlaub oder Faulenzen?  
whatever you prefer. doing stuff on holiday or sitting around at the beach being lazy. maybe also explain why.
- Strand oder Wald / Berge? Sommerurlaub oder Wintersport?  
What kind of holiday do you prefer? talk about it.
- Wie sieht dein Traumurlaub aus [Geld spielt keine Rolle]?
what would you do if money was out of the question? which country, what way of transport, etc. (for ideas, watch the top gear specials :) my personal favorite i'll hopefully do myself once is the vietnam one)

I suspect that if Syrizia can't secure any concessions from the ECB they'll request a referendum. If the referendum shows a willingness to accept further austerity under the current plan things will chug along until things get so bad that people just want out (no matter the costs). 

Eventually this will happen, there is a limit to how long people will accept a non-functional system without demanding a change. It doesn't mean the change will actually be better but that is unimportant.

That difference is a bit huge indeed, I don't know how similar both frigates are though. 

But in one case you're throwing 200m over the border and it's gone, while in the other the money will be going to German employees, R&amp;D, partially back into state coffers and sustaining/expanding industry knowledge/experience with the potential to create future turnover.

I don't see why you think it is necessary to lend money all the time. There were plenty of years where government budgets were on surplus, which means there was no need to take debt. Some countries used it to reduce their debts. It all depends on the timeframe. If you look at a very long time period, yes, all debts would rise as a sum and it is expected, due to the GDP expansion. 

Simply put, Greece's problem is they took out debts to raise the pay of government employees and social benefits so the people vote for the party in power.

Plus you have the Dublin arrangement that means there is no benefit to them preventing people getting in. If they process the migrants properly other countries can just deport them straight back there.

What needs to change is two things:

- Border countries need proper funding to help with the problem. This can be solved by increasing the budget of Frontex *massively*.
- The Dublin agreement needs to be repealed, all asylum claimants need to be dealt with *at* border countries unless they arrive by plane. There should be no people arriving in Germany by land and claiming asylum, they should be deported back to border countries. Those judged to be refugees must then be sent within the EU under some quota system, or not, but something has to be done with them. The EU could make a deal with another country to accept them for instance, as long as that country is safe.

The problem of course is what does it mean that a country is safe? I think safe compared to the standards they were used to. There is no reason we should be obligated to give Eritrean refugees the same rights as EU citizens. We're in the business of making sure they're not killed or persecuted, not that their financial situation is improved to Western standards. If the courts are deciding you cannot deport them, whether they are refugees or not, then the legislation or treaties that create that response need to be changed because it just seems ridiculous to me.
