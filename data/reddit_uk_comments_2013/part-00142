I live on the edge of Birmingham. If I'm travelling into the City Centre, I'll usually give myself 30 minutes extra time and get the bus before those 30 minutes, so generally closer to 40. If I'm getting a train, I'll make it an hour. 

The nature of the only bus route available to me means that I am necessarily travelling along the main thoroughfare in the south of the city, and shockingly sometimes things go wrong - a bus breaks down, or there's a car crash, or there are delays for some other reason. 

If I've given myself an hour extra, and the delay is an hour and 10 minutes, I'm still going to be 'just 10 minutes late.'

The problem with Adebayor last year was that he didn't show up match fit (how could he, be forced to train away from the first team at City) and then got hurt, caught a red card, left for the ACoN, got hurt again, and the finally got fit &amp; got a good run of games at the end of the year.

Where he scored what was, for me, the ""Goal of the Year not involving Bale"" against Chelsea, set up another few goals, and ended up being involved in 3 goals in 4 games to end the year, and played quite well.

I think that Adebayor gets a bad rap because he's not someone who, in the words of BAE, ""kisses the badge and then f*cks off"". No, he doesn't bleed white &amp; blue like Dawes. But you know what? Lots of our players don't.

Adebayor gets a bum rap from the media because he took a boatload of money to go to City, but honestly, the club he loved (Arsenal) had told him they wouldn't give him a new contract; what was he supposed to do?

Adebayor is a very good player who, because of easy-going nature, is viewed as lazy. He got very unlucky in how his year started last year, and never really recovered. That's fine; happened to Defoe the year before, and he had a decent year until he got hurt.

Operation Sea Lion (the German plan for the Invasion of Britain) was still in its embryonic stages when they failed to gain air superiority in the Battle of Britain at the end of 1940 and put the plans on hold. Their entire strategic outlook then shifted over the next 2 years towards the eastern front and the invasion of Russia in an effort to establish a secure oil supply line. 

I'm not sure though that they were ever really all that serious about it. They certainly made some serious material preparations to invade but a lot of historians believe the Germans were hoping that if faced with a serious prospect of a sucessful invasion the British might have settled for peace with the Germans instead -- which was always what Hitler had wanted... for Britain to control her colonies and for Germany to control the continent.

Infact he only planned an invasion of Britain (in his Fuhrer Directive 16) in response to the UKs apparent obtuseness in coming to a peaceful understanding after getting whipped in Northern France at the outset of the war.

From the Fuhrer Directive 16:

true,CapnJager,,Rum and coke. No ice.,"Looking at me, you'd probably have no idea about the amount of shit I've been through thanks to being born with hip dysplasia.  
  
My hips were dislocated from birth because of an underdeveloped tendon in my left hip - this wasn't noticed until my 6 month check-up at the doctor's. I had an operation to lengthen the tendon and was put in a frog cast for 6 weeks. Apparently I had to re-learn various basic movements.  
  
Fast forward to puberty/growth spurts and my hip starts acting up again. I've had so many sodding MRI/CT scans/X-rays/physiotherapy sessions ... one set of steroid injections (meant to relieve pain for a while, lasted 2 weeks) and keyhole surgery to re-shape the bone.  
  
According to the orthopaedic surgeon at the hospital my mum works at I'll need a hip replacement in about 10 years.

true,dontthrowstones,null,null,"&gt; public relations disaster that was the flag protests

I regard the flag issue as the public relations disaster. Whereupon all those super do-gooders in the Alliance dragged the country through what was prior a very small issue into world-wide politicised coverage. The protests were a part of that. That our supposed leaders created the situation that allowed those non-events to unfold was another.

&gt; the reality of it for the rest of the people in this country

See, here's the issue: Most people in this country weren't in the Ardoyne or the N/Ards Rd last night. Most people who watched the parades had a very good day.

Not that you'd form anything near that impression from browsing the submissions posted here over 48 hours.

&gt; trying to avoid the reality of what playing in a marching band means to most of its members

I know someone in that band and I can assure you it's not what your implying, same with me when I played in my school days. In fact, that band is a role model for others in it's area - no paramilitary alignments or emblems on display. It gives young people in their area a sense of pride and community, much like the GAA in others I'd imagine, and a day out and some fun. Running a band these days is a serious undertaking too given the costs involved and requires and gives a sense of responsibility to people who may not necessarily get that from other aspects of life. Isn't that what the 'great and good' on here (in italics 'cos we're all anonymous cowards, it could be a redditor typing on their phone from a crack den for all I know) were busy telling us 'these people' needed?

The only reality evidenced here is that a lot of redditors looking in cannot stand loyalist culture fullstop and hate it even more when it's something that cannot immediately be dismissed as generic 'bigoted/sectarian'.

&gt; How do you feel, in 2013, seeing this? 

I love it. If Xmas is a time for close family, the 12th is a time for meeting friends and having the crack with people you mightn't have seen in months, sometimes years. The pride displayed by those watching the wee man in the video is palpable and when you've a community such as ours who have come through quite a bit to get to where we are it's a chance to celebrate our own particular beliefs with like-minded people. That sounds pretty damn reasonable to me in 2013.

&gt; Would you have the same feeling if it were one of the AoH's bands?
 
If I'm reading things correctly I don't think a comparison with the AoH is fair either; The Loyal Orders and associated bands and parades are very much the equivalent to the GAA in size and effect. Of course, that particular community organisation's associations with para-militarism gets a by-ball while we get more moronic OTT bile every 12th from people who are either utterly naive at reading into situations or just plain cannot allow anything positive to be shared about my community. If it was one of those curious republican flute bands you mean, that would depend on whether they had a paramilitary association or not.

Eriksen is very talented, but he is raw and has a tendency to go missing in games. He doesnt have the acceleration of Coutinho to deal as well with physical defenders but I still think signing him would work out. He has an innate ability to control the tempo of a game. 

Not sure about Aldeweireld, he isn't as good as Vermalen or Verthongen. Neither does he have the pace or outstanding ability in the air we might ideally want. However he is very comfortable on the ball, and affordable. We could sign him this summer, and see how Kelly develops as a centre back in rotation.

 Founded in 1895, each season currently consists of more than 70 concerts in the Albert Hall, a series of chamber concerts at Cadogan Hall, additional Proms in the Park events across the United Kingdom on the last night, and associated educational and children's events. 

In 2009 the total number of concerts reached 100 for the first time. In the context of classical music festivals, Jiří Bělohlávek has described the Proms as ""the world's largest and most democratic musical festival"".


It was basically a way of pushing classical music to the masses and getting people interested in it. As Robert Newman said : ""I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music.

true,KarmaUK,null,null,"Indeed, this is a particularly stupid part of the Jobseeker's agreement, where they demand you 'call x number of employers per week, visit x number and write to x number'. Then add specifics like that.

They also asked if I read a paper, I said occasionally the 'i', and my agreement stated I had to check that daily for jobs.

The 'i' doesn't have a job section, and I only buy it maybe twice a week.

Fortunately I had read up on this before I applied and learned that the Jobseeker's agreement really is meant to be an agreement, not a list of demands from them.

You can negotiate with them if you can supply reasons.  I reasoned with them on the paper, as it had zero use as a source for jobs, and also the visiting and calling employers as my area of work just doesn't suit going up to office blocks, banging on the glass and yelling 'GISSA JOB!' at the secretary.

In the end, and the advisor was genuinely nice once we started talking and I showed some interest in actually looking for work, (Note, that does help often, I hear, show some actual interest in the job hunt, not just the benefits side) and he changed most of it to the internet activity instead, leaving me 1 phone call a week, and he quietly said 'but that can be to friends and family, asking if they know of any vacancies'.

Lastly, the sheer number of 'activities' you're expected to do, whatever you think of how much a jobseeker should do, the vast majority of jobs are posted online for 1-4 weeks.  What that means is when I check daily, I'm sat staring at the same jobs I looked at yesterday, the day before, and the day before that.  However, I have to do it to meet my quota of 'activities'.  My time may be far better spent writing speculative cover letters and CVs, however , that takes far longer.

I truly feel like if I spent my time doing constructive jobhunting activities instead of what I'm told I need to do to prove myself an active jobsearcher, I'd be doing far better.

Making people check the website daily (and I know it doesn't sound like much, I'm arguing that it's often a complete waste of time) is equivalent to making me check the local weekly paper daily.

I've checked it, I've applied for everything suitable, nothing's going to magically appear on page 37 that wasn't there yesterday.

In short, checking the sites Monday, Wednesday and Friday is no less a complete jobsearch than checking it twice a day, and in my opinion it's just an attempt to grind the last few grains of spirit from people at their lowest.",0,1373756990,null,0,false,0,cb22khy,t3_1i7pic,t1_cb22khy,t1_cb1w8ir,null,1430477912,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I will say, at various points throughout their seasons, I got that ""ancient guy with a ton of regret on his shoulders"" vibe from all of them. Season 3 and 4 with Tennant get pretty brutal. After he loses Rose the first time I think he starts to change into sort of more world weary, and by the end of season 4 Waters of Mars is like ""Ok, he's truly gone a little mad with power...he just doesn't care anymore because he can't care anymore because it's killing him.."" and then Eleven starts out almost child like and his character development was probably my favorite bit of his episodes because by last season, especially after he lost Amy and Rory, he became very angry. Pretty much after the whole thing with Demon's Run he starts to feel much more like the old man with the weight of all the bad, and all the good things on his shoulders. 

I think if I had to identify with one of the last three, it would probably be 9. I wanted to say 10, I really really did. I love his confidence and his I can talk a million miles an hour with really large words but it actually makes sense if you can follow it sort of speak....but 9. He's my guy. He's the one I started with, he's the one Rose fell in love with, he's the one I feel who's the most angry, the most sad, the most world weary...I really wish he would have done another season, but as I understand him and the producers didn't see eye to eye so he decided to part ways. Shit happens, but I really wish he would have come back for at least one episode. Everyone else has.

I just graduated from Heriot Watt doing Computer Science, and as so got to know a lot of the IS guys. 

In our first and second year the courses were near enough identical, there was no split between IS and CS. Both lots did the same classes and coursework and such, both had to learn programming, both had to do maths classes.

You were getting on Borini's back because he underperformed today and I was trying to explain why he didn't look so great and when you used Sturride as an example of someone who would have played better I simply stated it's because they're different players. 


Danny would have taken more touches and taken players on which  would have worked more effectively. Like when Borini dragged his shot I think Sturridge would have knocked it past the defender and when Borini had his 1-on-1 and put it wide, Sturridge would have rounded the keeper and slotted home. On the other hand though if this were an end to end game with lots of breakaway chances I feel the Borini would have suited the conditions better because Sturridge can sometimes take too many touches, slow up the move and waste the chance. 

Different players and styles suit different games that's why you have a squad full of different options not just one type of player, today we were limited so Borini had to start and it was also just to give him a run out.

I think you saying he's not good enough or us is silly though, every team has squad/fringe/backup players, Chelsea have had Paulo Ferreira for years and he barely got a game Arsenal had Squillaci they're not good enough for their teams and yet they were there.

&gt;So whilst covenants do still have some applications, you're overstating their value and validity if you think it could apply to preventing people from selling their own homes for a profit.

I would have thought the covenant wouldn't specifically be to stop the owner from selling for a profit, it would be to force them to sell back to the developer for the same amount they bought the property for had they only lived in it for less than 5 years, for example. And have this only apply to the first owner. I've heard that some park homes have these types of covenants (or similar).

Of course keeping the prices low continually in this manner wouldn't work, it would make a lot more sense to just rent them out at low rents.

**Song for Fifty: Lyrics (© Murray Gold)**
[1](#s ""As I stand here waiting for my time to come, I follow in your footsteps. I follow when you run 
From the jaws of disaster, from a planet besieged by deadly ancient foes
And you still make me smile when you stop and turn and say: ""This is a creature we can understand, a living being, it is just being. If we could find what's on its mind then perhaps 
We might survive."")
[2](#s ""And as we stumble down our slow road I can't but wonder what would it be like. To run away with you through time, where would we go who might we find. But on we go, cutting our paths, only one way, one day at a time, while you embrace the universe, spinning your way on the fast road, limitless endless."") 
[3](#s ""So my dear friend you're getting kinda old now (or maybe we are). And now our children watch you do the deeds we marvelled at wondered at. From the jaws of disaster, from a planet besieged by deadly ancient foes."")
[4](#s ""It's not the end yet there is no end."")
[5](#s ""Fumbling and bumbling while all around is crumbling and stumbling through time like you're a mad man still it's humbling to watch you reconcile divergent creeds without succumbing to the lure of weapons, force or greed you only use intelligence and jokes and charm."")
[6](#s ""Happy birthday. Doctor. You."")

""Banjaxed"" is apparently very close to the Swahili (or Urdu... or something African, I can't remember, sorry) word for ""broken"" and only appeared in Northern Irish language shortly after some troops returned from Africa around the start of the 20th century. It's thought that the troops liked the word so much that they brought it back and somehow it became Northern Irish slang!

I read about it ages ago, so a few of the details may be off but I think it might have been the Boer wars, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't an Afrikaans word. Still cool though!

**Edit:** Just checked, the Urdu word that it is thought to come from is ""Bahnn Gehecked"" which was the name for these big clay pots that broke pretty easily, so troops in India (not Africa, sorry) took the word to be the name for the breakages not the clay, and brought it back with them.

true,PlayingForTheShirt,cnty-ni,"#Flegs","This is shameful and disgraceful and this is comiing from someone who reserves little support for the Police Service of Northern Ireland (unrelated to this story.)

I understand there are frustrations in the Loyalist community and I can understand those frustrations. It's quite clear that the Parades Commission - the government organisation setup to control parades in Northern Ireland - is being used as a front for Irish Republican agendas. As someone who's attended several parades they do not 'infringe' the rights of anyone and are over within a few minutes in most cases. I find it very pety that people are offended by a marching band.

I'd suggest that it's the case of being offended that is causing so much trouble in the first place. If we could have some form of dialogue between the two communities to reach a grounds of understanding I think these parades not only could but WOULD pass off peacefully.

However, I cannot lay the blame at the feet of just the offended residents (some of whom travel over 100 miles just to be offended 'residents'), while groups like GARC in The Ardoyne do cause part of the trouble it is the ignorant Loyalists who either react to the traps laid down by these resident groups and Sinn Féin or just start their own violence who will make these restrictions continue and deter any form of communication and understanding between the two different cultures and communities.

This years ""Twelth"" has yet again proven that Northern Ireland is still very far away from any understanding and agreement between different cultures. It's a real shame. I don't believe that banning parades or heavy restrictions is the answer. You'll never satisfy the Loyalist community by doing that. However I think you can statisfy both communities by building that understanding, but, no government programme is going to cause that. It takes time, effort and dialogue between these two conflicting groups and you cannot force that. 

What I would encourage, as someone who doesn't come from either extreme, is to ensure that no one lays the blame at just the doors of the Orange or the Green. It's both extremists on both sides who cause this mayhem every 12th. Most of us just want to go to the bands, enjoy the bands, go back to the bar and get smashed with our mates. At the same time many of those who would never attend the bands accept the existence of them and are happy to see them walk peacefully near their neighborhood.

Society grants *limited liability* to corporations, and IMO they owe us something in return.

Not only that, but they have more power than us generally, due to economies of scale.

If we don't like the small print in our mobile phone contract, for example, we can't negotiate with the mobile phone company and expect them to change it; we can choose a different mobile phone company, but they all spend far more on lawyers than any of us can, having these contracts written in their favour.

There seems to be a tendency, from what I can see, on this subreddit (and thus probably in the wider political discussion?) to talk about *what's fair* in terms of two people who can like it or leave it.

In fact, or society doesn't work that way any more, and we're *forced* to deal with corporations on a daily basis - I simply can't buy my power or water from people with whom I can deal on equal terms. If I go into arrears on my electricity bill, the supplier will achieve recourse far more efficiently than I will do if I find they've fitted a meter which reads incorrectly.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I'm all for massively increasing investment in cycling infrastructure, and encouraging people to use their bikes, but the bike will never totally replace the car, at least outside of the cities.

That's something of a strawman. I'm proposing that cycling infrastructure could be funded more than it is at present which doesn't exist in any meaningful way accept as a touristy thing. Rail has been a proven form of mass transport as well, so ""never totally replace the car"" is something of an irrelevance. It might be nice if that plant cranked out super efficient velomobiles that did 20mph max. Not just bicyclists benefit from bicycle infrastructure.

&gt; overwhelming utility and economic value,

Totally debatable. I could have included peak obesity, peak space, peak centralised agriculture, peak destruction of social fabric and most importantly peak car ownership. The number of households without a car is plateauing at about 20% despite the highly polished turd that is the motorvehicle paradigm and *the** heavily subsidised costs.

Socio-philosophically: It's the serfs paying for their own serfdom, mostly just to drive to work and the out of town supermarket. It's a de-unionised form of transport that is hated in the common case where one worker used to drive 60-100 others to destination and now nearly every one is their own unpaid chauffeur. Emotionally people are realising its wrong, hence the rage and stress of the commute, but economically we aren't far off pricing people out of its ""utility"", ~3k out of ~13k is a great deal and its only going up. Anecdotally, the trend I've seen amongst my student peers and childhood friends is to forgo the car. I knew someone that gave up their second job, gave up the car and was in profit. Who'da thought? The opportunity cost of driving yourself to work is immense.

&gt; with plug-in hybrid cars

Peak lithium. Hybrid cars are still going to kill people but at least they'll be doing it quietly. They found 500m£ to throw at the car industry as an ""investment"" they could do more good sending that money on rolling back car extremism—no one wants to live on a main road but many don't have a choice.

Negredo seems like a logical and reasonable choice, he is a guy who has banged in a fair share of goals the past several seasons (31 this past season and 26 in 10/11).  Big strong striker who can hold the ball up and has a decent amount of touch on his passes. Personally i don't think he is as good as the other strikers  we are rumored with interest in and its debateable that he is as good as Ade when Ade is interested in playing, but he seems to be able to find the back of the net fairly well.

Despite the City interest i am guessing that he will go less than the £20m-25m that Villa want for Benteke and probably less than Soldado as well. Seems like he is a plan B/C type of signing because plan A would be getting too expensive.

There is an assuredness in receiving the ball that isn't apparent with every striker, or compared to Borini. I can see where comparisons with Bellamy, and to a lesser extent with Suarez come from. Almost a less pacey version of Bellamy, but with more flair like Suarez. 

 I can see him being a very valuable, versatile asset this season even if he never becomes a first team player he is the kind of squad player we need. It is a big step up from the youngsters we've had to use over the past year.

Dani Pacheco always looks great in preseason, but he rarely produces anything of note. I hope he moves to a side where he can develop and play regular first team football.

I know a lot of people here rate Ibe, but for me Sterling is way way ahead of him. He has far more intelligence, his movement is more varied and he more comfortable leaving his wing. Obviously he is older and has played more first team football than Ibe, but I hope people don't lose faith in Sterling just because we overplayed him and he became burnt out / injured by February.

The trick is to not give up until you literally can't think straight. By then, your body is so tired, it will literally just shut down and not wake up again until it is completely recouperated.

It took me a long time to warm up to Smith's portrayal of The Doctor because they keep making him younger and younger and more wacky, which troubles me a bit. To quote Magda from AbFab, ""If the models get any younger, Pats, they'll be chucking foetuses down the catwalk!""

The Orange Order who say they should have the right to march where they want, when they want and that they are British subjects who should be allowed on the 'Queens high way'. That ended with the GFA more or less because just before the signing the march in portadown or more precisely Catholic Garvaghy road, where the march was stopped from walking through the estate and loyalists rioted, shot and threatened anything that moved really. With the GFA the Parades commission was also created and determine which parades are allowed and which are not and what will be allowed to happen during these parades, they made some loyalist parades have a single drum beat when walking past a Catholic church but the Loyalist bands broke this and played the Famine song and called Catholics second class citizens.

The funny thing about these provocative marches is that the Catholic residents are willing to allow the Orange Order to walk through if they do not play sectarian songs like the famine song or no Pope of Rome or do 'the bouncy' which is making fun of of bouncing on a Catholics head. This was achieved every where else in the North or Ireland apart from Ardoyne/Woodvale, Short Strand and Carrick Hill.

The GFA promised so much more for the residents of the state such as jobs, housing and equal opportunities but they are not being provided to the working class districts, districts that the paramilitaries draw their support from, these districts are building with anger because as I stated before there are no houses and no jobs, the problem for Loyalists is that their paramilitary leaders play it off as Catholics are reaping the benefits of the GFA and Protestants and losing out so that loyalist politicians will keep getting elected and hold Sinn Fein off all that longer. 

If you recently saw the loyalist flag protests, where flying the flag on designated days was brought in and into line with the United Kingdom, loyalists rioted and protested for months but it was not all about the flags, they claimed the state was bigoted against them for doing so even though the DUP are the biggest party in the state, but then instead of improving anything with in their own community what do loyalist politicians do? they go and spend around 40,000 pounds on new flag poles...",0,1373778272,null,0,1373778520,0,cb28wx1,t3_1i8wae,t1_cb28wx1,t1_cb24vsg,null,1430474852,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

All of the other things you've listed WILL have lots of tourists in or around them, but that's because most of them are world-class points of interest in a world class city. Tourists come with the territory I'm afraid. I'd suggest skipping Oxford Street unless you're a huge fan of shopping or department stores -- and even if that does float your boat I'd recommend just hitting Selfridges and then going elsewhere for shopping.

Depending on how detailed you want your visit to each of of the places on the list to be, it's either easily do-able or impossible in 4 days. For example if you want to just walk around St. Paul's from the outside, take a few photos and then move on, that's a 30-minute stop. If you want to visit the cathedral inside, including the crypts, the main church and the dome, you're going to want to budget 2-3 hours. So that'd be pretty much a whole morning gone by the time you factor in travel time to get there and lunch afterwards. Similarly with the other attractions (although the British museum is big enough that you could spend the entire 4 days just in there, if you wanted!)

This isn't completely true. Eriksen actually thrives against better teams, with better defenders. The only matches he goes missing in are agains the bottom half of the Eredivisie. The reason he gets shit for that is because you'd expect your star player to be amazing against the weaker teams, but he does the opposite. It's because Eriksen is best when the spaces are small and the thinking is quick. Given too much time he overthinks it and can make bad decisions, whereas on instinct he's amazing.

His best matches are in the Champions League, and against PSV, Feyenoord, and Twente. Give him more opponents like those and he will be more consistent. I'd also say that given that he is best when everything is moving quickly, I think he could potentially even be a great player for Bayern or Barca.

I don't think any party from outside the traditional power base (like that, will use it myself) can get into the traditional power base without becoming like the traditional power base. You have to work a certain way in order to get any traction (see Caroline Lucas and the refuse workers in Brighton as an example). 

The idea that an alternative party could penetrate politics is nice but in reality, even as alarm is growing in the scientific community about the pollution problem, a party that is apparently dedicated to solving these problems can't get airtime, let alone votes. 

Unless there was a mass epiphany and the bulk of voters all ticked the box saying - Monster Raving Loony Party just like that one day, there can't be a change that comes through the ballot box, or it is unlikely to happen as David Cameron taking off him human-suit to reveal the lizard underneath. 

&gt;I think political parties hold too much power in our and most other Western democracies

There will inevitably always be organisations. But if there is no recognition for political organisations in the structure of society, it wouldn't be a problem. 

There are two ideas I like that would yield an improvement: 

1. Government by lotto - pick people at random to be in government and change them every few years. 

2. Have communities nominate people they think would make good leaders for leadership. 

In either system, anyone who expresses the desire to govern, lead or manage should be immediately disqualified.

Furthermore I think he's different to the #10 Rodgers wants, look at Mkhitaryan -- strong physically and provides defensively as well as very well offensively. This isn't this case with Eriksen and that's shown with Ajax refraining from playing him in the centre of midfield but on the left wing giving him less of a defensive responsibility. 

Same kind of situation with Alderweireld, I feel that if we were going to make a move for him, we would've already. Especially with Norwich reported bid of £6.9mill being accepted, but Tony rejecting the move.

true,ArtistEngineer,australia,Cambridgeshire,"I've considered them but they do charge a substantial markup and they pay way below market price for trade-ins/part-exchange.

I've been to [AvailableCar](http://www.availablecar.com/) on a number of occasions, but I only go there to browse cars and to check out particular models, which I will then seek out from a local dealer. Where else can you find 1000+ cars in the one place, doors unlocked, no sales people hassling you. I take the kids, they love it!

I bought my car (6yr old Passat) from a largish local dealer. I also bought their 12month warranty. It was worth its weight in gold as I was able to go back and get a number of things fixed on the car within that 12 months (timing belt, tyres, wipers, parking sensors, airbag electrical fault). Lots of little things, but I could go in, get a (crappy) courtesy car for a few days and rarely had to pay a cent (penny). If it wasn't covered by warranty, they charged me for parts and gave me either free or cheap labour. Large car yard, has lots of deals with repair workshops.

I even had a bent/worn front axle which caused the car to vibrate and tremble, they fixed it on the spot, for free.

The warranty that they gave me specified that the car must be fully serviced according to the service manual otherwise the warranty is not valid. So I went back to them and pointed out that the timing belt and transmission fluid hadn't been changed according to the mileage and therefore they sold me an invalid warranty. They actually offered to take the car back from me and refund my money, but I really liked the car so I stuck with it and got it resolved.

You might not be so lucky, and lots of places say that these warranties aren't worth the paper they're printed on. In my case, it was worth it.

**tl;dr** big places can offer some useful advantages if things go wrong and, from my experience, this can work out for the better.

If this isn't answered then BT will then reroute your call to a neighbouring force, who will take the call on the original force's behalf and pass it on via their own dedicated line. 

BT will also contact the original force via the control room inspector and ask him if he has any technical difficulties. If not then he will have a polite reminder of his obligations and a report will be submitted.

true,avirup2008,null,null,"It's actually a lot of factors combined into one.

1. Suarez has said he wants a move indirectly time and again (not referencing this shite unverified quote but the interviews given to the media during Confed Cup). Things had become so bad in fact, that LFC had to release a statement saying ""We expect Luis Suarez to honour his contract with us"" in a salvo to save the club's media image at the time. By all means, he is a fantastic player who has every right to think of his future. The problem does not lie with the fact that he wants to leave, but the manner in which he is expressing it in public.

2. Our club has been doing pretty well lately in terms of forming a formidable talent group with a sharp eye for the future. The acquisition of Mignolet, Aspas, Alberto and Coutinho, not to mention Ibe and Sterling and Pachecho means that we have a squad with balance, depth and precision. This is no longer like last season where we hoped Sterling would not get injured in the first half of the season because we were so lacking in options. Suarez pulled us through virtually alone and was indispensable. Right now, he is our brightest star yet, but his departure is not the end of the world, as it would have been, just one season ago.

3. The fans and media alike have come to terms with the BR philosophy of football which focuses on young, versatile talent with a penchant for attacking, fluid soccer. The very notion that Suarez would go for 45 million+ gives the notion that we can get 2-3 top players for the money who can contribute to our first team potential AND sustain us for the next few seasons. With names like Eriksen and Bernard being thrown in, it truly is exciting times as compared to last summer.

Finally, as a fan, I love him. I really LOVE what he has done for the club on the pitch. However, the fan-idol relationship, just like real life, is also fleeting and at one point must end. The best progression for all is in handling this maturely and focus on the positives that can come out if he stays/leaves in the coming weeks.

As long as this ends amicably, I have no reactions either way. I wish him the best for his career whether he is with us or for someone else. 

However, as a fan, I simply request all the other fans out here not to take out their pitchforks so early. There are professionals including BR monitoring the Suarez scenario and they would take the best decision considering all inside sources and info ( which will be me MUCH more reliable than that of SkySports or The Telegraph).",0,1373809550,null,0,false,0,cb2e9qw,t3_1i9w0x,t1_cb2e9qw,t3_1i9w0x,null,1430472316,22,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,22

""The twat speaks again?"" Fuck. You. That twat carried us for the better part of two seasons. Everyone wants to go on and on about being optimistic and excited from winning a bullshit preseason game, but a few unsourced quotes come out about our best player and you cock suckers break down and start acting like petulant children.

I thought you all were better than this reactionary shit. Grow up bitches

Edit: well the original post (which you can still find on /r/soccer) that led to this thread has been deleted, but the point still stands. When the top post on this sub was the ""twat speaks again,"" I'm not going to be happy about it. My post wasn't made for substance or discussion, it was strictly to call out the absurd reaction a lot of our members had to that link. 

I adamantly defended Suarez during the Evra situation, and wasn't calling for his head after the biting. Still, I'm pissed off about how he has acted this summer just like most of you, but it still doesn't warrant the vitriolic hate coming at him. I hope we keep him and get to watch another 30 goal season. If he doesn't want to play, let him waste the next three years on the bench. If we sell him, I'll be excited and optimistic of what BR and the scouting team can do with €50 million. If City sold Tevez after he went rover and ran off to Argentina, would they have won the PL? He did set up Aguero's league winner. Honor? Tradition? Nope. It's about winning, plain and simple. I'd rather watch a team full of child molesters win us the league than watch another mid table season.

This is modern sports, and money and recent success carries a lot more weight than history unfortunately. Unless a player is homegrown, you can't expect him to hold a fan's loyalty. Again, Suarez has busted ass and carried us since he came from Ajax. What more can you want from a player?

I'm sorry because it seems like I rubbed some people the wrong way. We tend to devolve during silly season and really, I just miss the good, in season game by game discussions that are usually on this sub. Let's all be happy that we aren't Mancs, Gooners, or Chelski/City glory hunters and just keep on supporting the best club in the world in our big, dysfunctional, online Kop.",0,1373810202,null,0,1373861877,0,cb2eeep,t3_1i9w0x,t1_cb2eeep,t3_1i9w0x,null,1430472254,50,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,50

But that's just it isn't? Last year it was republicans rioting on the 12th. How was the reaction? 'I hate the 12th of July'. Loyalists are damned whether they did anything wrong or not. That's not a whinge, it's an accurate statement based on what's went on since the rise of the politically motivated residents groups and the violence around interface areas whether that violence is republican or otherwise.

On parading being about 'superiority' - the world over, battles of every type and scale are commemorated in whatever way and for whatever reason. Why is this one about superiority? Are the others? Or are those people just thankful that our forefathers went through the ordeal of battle to achieve an outcome that meant we could continue our way of life?

Why shouldn't we celebrate that? I've talked about it elsewhere, but the parades are a spectacle that draws people together, like Xmas with the family or whatever else. Why should we lose what is unique, positive and public about our culture just because curmudgeons think if it doesn't involve them it shouldn't happen?

The Loyalists have a gripe with the parades commission for a few reasons - it was formed off the back of an issue they never felt was resolved (Drumcree) but they were forced to accept by ""their"" politicians who later took u-turns on other important issues.  For a few years the Orange Order had managed to keep the bands in relative check and they, for the most part, followed the orders of the commission, orders they felt were harsh but were dealt out in a ""carrot and stick"" approach.  I've heard it said by hardcore folks it was the final straw when the carrot was snapped and the stick wielded after those concessions and they were told this year again ""if you do this this year, you might get something next year"".  Even I will say they've said that every year, so no one's taking them seriously anymore.

The anger in Loyalism doesn't stem these days from leaders whipping them up against Catholics, I'm not sure who's been telling you that.  Their anger comes from the fact they feel abandoned - who do you vote for now if you're a Loyalist?  Everyone who claims to represent them has lied to them and they're not - quite - stupid enough to miss that.  The only reason the DUP keep getting in is their fear of Sinn Fein, but even that's been waning.

As for the flags, as ridiculous as the issue was some comments made to me brought home the actual underlying issues which motivated the wealth of feeling.  Loyalists - and even Unionists in general - irrationally fear the spectre of this Nationalist majority on the horizon.  It was extremely immature then for the first city council not to be a Unionist majority in decades to make one of their first issues of discussion the removal of a Unionist symbol from the centre of the city.  There were a thousand issues should have come first (especially at Christmas - we took a massive hit in 2012), and it would surely have been better had they not decided to in one moment justify their fears at the first opportunity, if only in a small way.

Most of us here want to move away from tribal politics, but by even discussing flags what have they done?  Driven Loyalists who were turning moderate back to the extremes.  The most ludicrous and even depressing element was the Alliance Party's stance, who had no political tact at all - how have they risen in recent years?  Through support in East Belfast.  They should have played the game and realised who's been voting for them; it is very, very sad that it is game over for them now.

As for the Ardoyne specifically, the bands did their thing for the past couple of years, passed peacefully, and then Republicans turned out for nights on end to cause the same level of trouble you're seeing now, but maybe it wasn't reported as heavily (this, whether justified or not, is often another point you hear Loyalists make).  It remains to be seen if the Loyalists will carry on as long as the Republicans did the last couple of years, but if the flegs issue from the turn of the year is anything to go by, it probably will.

So anyway, I thought I'd try and portray some context from the Loyalist side, as Reddit doesn't get much context when these stories come out.

TL/DR; Social and economic issues - which effect both sides - create the environment for working class on both ""sides"" to kick off.

It is of fundamental importance that talented, intelligent people represent us as politicians. Government by lotto seems a terrible idea to me as I do not see the average Briton as having the interest or ability to really grapple with the subject. 

Having an open door to political candidates regardless of education is obviously important, but in our current system the vote of the electorate whittles down the candidates, in theory excluding those who lack the ability to represent their constituents effectively. Unless you lay out strict guidelines to whittle down candidates in your lotto then I think it would be inefficient and ineffective, and if strict guidelines do exist you're essentially creating a ruling class from which Government is drawn from. Having no checks on those who enter government would be disastrous: we've seen incredible political incompetence in the last few centuries from some of the most intelligent and highly educated people in the country. I can't foresee it ending well if your average Joe was thrown into such situations.


Your second idea is essentially the basis of representative democracy, though I suppose you intend it to be a more micro form of government than our current system. I think there is definite merit to devolution from central powers to local powers, and it's a trend that is progressing fast in our country. Though I must ask, why do you see it as necessary to exclude anyone who expresses a desire to govern? I've always felt that the vast majority of politicians enter that line of work with a clean conscience, honestly trying to change the world for the better.

true,dontthrowstones,null,null,"&gt; To put it in perspective if the KKK had parades in a city and every year 

That's not perspective. The OO has nothing to do with the KKK, unless you regard the local Church Youth Club as the KKK too seeing as it only permits people from within it's religion to join.

I don't know much about the KKK but I'm pretty sure they don't fraternise with their Black neighbours. I don't know an Orangeman who doesn't. The Orange has a long history of co-operating with their local Catholic community, whether charity back the day, helping out the AoH after that, or working together to build community centres or whatever today. 

Edit: sources, expansions requested:

Well, I know my local lodge worked with the local Catholic community to secure cross-community funding for both their own respective rural community groups and also joint projects. The AoH thing is the oft-carried stories about lending eachother spare band equipment for their respective parade days. The charity stuff is just ongoing; there is 'internal' specialist Protestant-related stuff and then general help-the-public stuff: http://www.grandorangelodge.co.uk/supporting-charities

The back in the day reference was to the support Orangemen at various levels gave during the famine. Soup kitchens and the like. There were also Orange-affiliated missions like the ICM which set up schools in the West of Ireland, speaking the local Gaelic dialect. The merits of aid+conversion type charity work would be looked down upon today, but it was widespread at the time, and goes against the idea that the order was pro-segregation.

I cannot accept any comparison with the KKK as reasonable. A Catholic or anyone else can convert to whatever beliefs Orangeism holds at a particular time should they wish to do so and they will not be denied entrance. A black person cannot under any circumstances join the KKK. Personal choice is denied. The two are fundamentally different.

You don't have perspective the moment you bring the crazy into the equation. You immediately identify yourself as someone with an agenda, with poison to spread.

And then comes the real clincher: 'make it about the Northern Irish people, not ""British people"".

What a lot of struggling companies are doing is treating HMRC as an interest free loan. A company can put off paying the £1million they owe them and use that to keep the business going. When HMRC start getting aggressive, the company says they can't pay it, goes into administration.

As the money owed is unsecured debt (albeit with other legal issues around it), the tax bill is low down in the list of what gets paid, so generally HMRC loses out a massive chunk of cash when the administrators negotiate how much of their unsecured debt they'll pay off. HMRC loses £750K, business resumes trading with a different owner.

No one made anyone do anything. A democratic vote in the Belfast City Council resulted in the flag only being shown on designated days, in line with the majority of UK councils. 

The 'fleg' incident had nothing to do with these recent riots, except that the behaviour and actions expressed by a small yet violent section of the loyalist community was the same. The Parades Commission determined that allowing the Orange Order to march through a largely catholic community would be far too antagonistic, and stated that they wouldn't be allowed to do so. The leaders of the Orange Order had a fit and called on their members and the loyalist community to take to the streets to protest this. When the Order attempted to march through anyway, the were met with a police blockade. The crowd then attacked the police force. They attacked them for upholding the law and doing their job. 

There are morons on both sides of this conflict. Republican dissidents intent on bringing Northern Ireland back into the horror days of The Troubles have earned nothing but disgust from me, and they are rightfully condemned for their sectarian actions but people have to see them as being on the very fringes of our society. The Orange Order is a large, visible and influential organisation in the protestant community. They have to realise that Northern Ireland has changed immeasurably for the better, and they need to respect that. The violent and vocal minority of the loyalist community also needs to realise that a shared and equal future is just that: shared and equal. They need to realise that they no longer have the overwhelming and frankly disgusting control that they had over Northern Ireland. Preventing a march through a nationalist area is not eroding your rights or your culture. Flying the british flag in accordance with the majority of UK councils is not eroding your rights or your culture.

The reason we like him is because he's very good at football. The reason the club stands by him is because he's very good at football. We are both just acting in our interests. Remember when Itandje was bombed out for disrespecting the Hillsborough memorial? Well the club decided to keep Damien Plessis, who had done the same thing as Itandje, on the basis that he was a promising youngster whereas Itandje was a reserve goalie with an attitude problem. If Suarez was a bad player none of us would give a shit about him wanting to leave, we wouldn't have defended him in the early days of the Suarez/Evra affair and so on.

So the fans and the club are acting in their own interest. Suarez is acting in his interest; he made a career move to come here and it hasn't worked out; we're still 7th. 

When he talks publicly about wanting to leave and so on, that does irritate me. But it's a mild inconvenience for fuck's sake, it just shows his desperation to leave because no clubs are really in for him right now. 

I'm fed up with people saying: 
&gt;OH JUST FUCKING LEAVE NOW SUAREZ LETS JUST SELL HIM 30M NOW BECAUSE IM FED UP WITH THIS

No, it's not ironic.  It doesn't even follow.  It's a non-sequitur.

I gave that as an example.  That's why I said example in the sentence.  You'd think that would make it obvious enough, but no.

&gt;You seem to misunderstand what I've been saying so apologies for that

Actual irony here.  I did not misunderstand what you said, you misunderstood what I've been saying.

You've still to figure out what a false dilemma is.

&gt;There's then a response that fracking is ""in principle obscene"", that's not an argument for or against, it's an arbitrary opinion and seems to stem from a misunderstanding of how fracking works.

Well, that depends on what he meant was obscene.  Things can be obscene.  Claiming you can ignore what someone says just because they used that word is flawed.

The clear implication was of the dangers, which you later agreed with.

&gt;My response pointed out there's a lot of demand for the products fracking provides, if you don't like it find something else. This is not a ""false dilemma"", if you can't provide other options being ""obscene"" is simply an unhelpful and pointless argument against something.

This is exactly what you said:

&gt;If you're so against it, you're very welcome to give up your energy usage or offer some alternative sources.

That is a blatantly clear false dilemma and an idiotic one at that.  It also completely dismisses all concerns over safety.  That attitude would lead to no dangerous activity being criticised by the public, who most definitely can be negatively affected by it.  It would also lead to few dangerous activities being highlighted by the media.  

Your attitude is in itself dangerous and highly counter-productive.

If most people don't even know that something is dangerous, that there is a problem, how is a solution to come about?

&gt;I don't know what I did to offend you, but I'm going to ignore the ""trolling"" comment because you clearly don't understand what that means.

I was not a fan of dzeko, he looked lost at some points and was pretty slow with not only body movement but ball movement as well. I will cut him some slack though because we had no true wingers on while he was out there so there weren't any real crosses coming in. 


 Managerially I thought pellegrini was fine its a preseason game I'm not going to read much into strategies because execution isn't always there. The one thing I didn't like was that he took out all of the creativity from the midfield at the half. I mean I understand you get nine subs go ahead and use em but he should have split up the squad for the two halves better. Bringing on Milner, Yaya, and Rodwell at the same time just doesnt work well. They are all little variations of each other. Obviously Yaya is the best of the bunch but the all are powerful run at you midfielders and the lack of creativity in the second half was glaring. 

Also Milner, those crosses were at the level of bebe.

Edit:nearly forgot number 16's vision was amazing. His passing was second to none on the field and his through balls were exquisite. I think he'll end up on a la liga side by the end if next summer.

And I'm not expecting them too, however, with proper infrastructure cycling and assisted scooting can be the preferred method for many, many people. There are only 32 million cars in the UK, it's supposed to reach 40 million some time over the next decade. All under 17s are barred from the ""freedom and utility"" the car gives them, they are also over represented in the death tolls.

The essential thing to remember is that year after year the car has been subsidised at the behest of special interests especially freight giving us an artificial winner regarding transport paradigm and a bastardised environment engineered to suit. Motorways and roads have been deliberately widened and reinforced to cope with the immense tonnage. Big haulage is a false economy, as is all those supermarkets taking advantage of externalising their transport costs by pushing the it to the consumer and tax payer. 

""91"" suggests you are young and I don't suppose you have met many elderly people locked inside their homes because of eyesight failure or someother disability. The car can only be driven by ~50% of the UK, women have historically been excluded for whatever reason and there remains a gender bias. For all the ""freedom"" the car gives it certainly likes to create marginalised ghettos.

true,oppositeofbrucewayne,null,null,"I've just finished second year so I can maybe give a more up to date picture (I say 'maybe' cos the department seems adamant on completely changing courses every year. I've honestly felt like such a guinea pig.) I also successfully managed to switch from IS to CS, it's usually the other way round! So there's an insight there.

I was in a similar boat to you, originally applied for CS but I completely messed up my Higher Maths so they put me into IS, and I wasn't exactly sure on the difference at first. I was also doing a maths course at summer school so I thought this could potentially help me switch back if necessary.

I'd done a bit more research, found out IS was alot more business-heavy and programming-lite, especially in later years. So by the time the course started I was pretty adamant I'd do whatever it takes to switch to CS, I wanted to stick with programming. I was lucky as I already knew my mentor from summer school (I'd also done a Computing course at HW. Second-Life... trust me, it might seem all snazzy and fun at first, but after 12 weeks -- 19 in my case!-- you'll grow to despise it.) and because of the way the modules worked out at the time. There were three shared modules between CS and IS in the first semester. Software Development 1 (introduces Java), Interactive Systems (the aforementioned Second Life module, some second year maths students will also do this) and Praxis (essays and presentation skills. Read: skive). For their fourth module IS students could pick an elective course, most of these seem to be languages. Now, I cheekily asked if I could pick the missing CS course at the time Logic and Proof. (Not sure if they're still running it, it was technically a maths course but I actually didn't mind it too much).

I was still technically an IS student but I was doing all the CS courses, after a lot of annoying my mentor and because of my results I finally switched a few weeks into the second semester. See by the second semester the divide between CS and IS started to show. Both CS and IS students did a Web Design and Databases which touched on HTML, XHTML, CSS and PHP; aswell as Intro to Computer Systems (computer architecture, that kinda stuff.) There were two Software Development modules only done by CS students, while IS students instead did a business module (I never actually went to this as it clashed) and 'Technology in Society' (The sci-fi module, two hour 'lecture' watching Terminator was fun. Then we discussed robots, and read some short stories. Sadly I'd properly switched before we got to the creative writing. Yeah... I wasn't quite sure on the entire point of this module. But it kept a certain lecturer busy...). 

In second year, again the split was more prominent. I'm not sure on the exact modules of IS students here, but both did Interaction Design (group game design project), Software Design (you'll learn a million different diagrams), Internet and Comms (I know this module's been completely changed, I think they've scrapped the networking part and made it more PHP and web design focused?) and Database Management Systems (Alot more on SQL queries)

IS students missed modules on Data Structures and Algorithms, Programming Languages, Discrete Maths and Formal Specification. I'm guessing these were replaced with management type modules?


TL;DR: IS is more businessy, no maths and less programming in later years. Though there's still quite a bit of web and db stuff in the first two years.
CS is more about programming, data structures, algorithms etc, so naturally includes somewhat more maths. 

For me it just depended on if I wanted to do programming or not, which I did. I'm definitely not the best with maths, but I've managed so far (through the skin of my teeth maybe this last semester.)
If you really want to you can make the switch, though it's more common to switch from CS to IS.

Also I definitely agree about joining the Computing Society once you're here, they should have a stall at the fresher's fair. Great way to meet people in both CS and IS.

In the case of a lotto, the random nature of it, even if it selected a government comprising 50% utter cretins, we'd still be better off that we are today. In the case of community nomination, it would be the democratic choice of the community. If they nominate a person, that is the person they want. I guess reasonable measures to sack a representative would make sense. 

&gt;Having no checks on those who enter government would be disastrous: we've seen incredible political incompetence in the last few centuries from some of the most intelligent and highly educated people in the country. I can't foresee it ending well if your average Joe was thrown into such situations.

I just can't imagine any circumstances worse than what we have now - public school, out-of-touch lawyers and other professionals who's very way of life is based on a self-serving, power-hungry and nepotistic outlook. 

The average Joe is exactly the kind of person I would like to see. Even ASBO scum or hookers and junkies or dirty foreigners or the illiterate would be preferable. 

&gt;Though I must ask, why do you see it as necessary to exclude anyone who expresses a desire to govern?

I guess it might be a matter of worldview to see that anyone who desires to lead or be in power is unsuited to it.

&gt;I've always felt that the vast majority of politicians enter that line of work with a clean conscience, honestly trying to change the world for the better.

I don't think this is the case. Our politicians are the type of people who demonstrate their ability to conform by working towards success in school exams and then university. They have the stamina to sit through university and then operate in professions such as law and accounting. They have likely attended exclusive institutions in their educational and professional lives. Even superficially, you can see they don't represent the population. The filters are designed to select venal goody-goodies. 

My option 2 would mean that communities select their leaders. You might translate that to work in the existing constituencies and have the same parliament but the MPs are not people who put themselves up. They would be people who are selected by the people who live in the constituency and who know someone who they think would do a good job. Maybe each constituency could come up with their own way of selecting someone but it would have to prohibit any competition in which a candidate can promote themselves.",0,1373816749,null,0,false,0,cb2fyuo,t3_1i9nxf,t1_cb2fyuo,t1_cb2el9y,null,1430471516,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It's like when your girlfriend is about to dump you and you dump them first. So juvenile and hilarious. 

The funniest part is where so many people are talking about disrespect? How is it disrespectful to say Liverpool are nowhere near the top? The club has been closer to the middle of the table than the top for 3 seasons running, that's the epitome of a mid table club. The people who have problems with him biting seem to forget that he was serving a suspension for exactly that when he joined Liverpool from Ajax. The real reason why the fans are reacting in this way is because they are afraid of losing their best player, and they are afraid that the club will earn less money from his transfer. To say otherwise, like they have been on the front page, is ridiculous. I just find it ridiculous. I really hope someone shows Suarez all the hate that is on the internet and it strengthens his resolve to leave.

For example if you household income is £800 per month spending 50% of the income on rent makes sense, anything under £400 (in the cheapest towns) is going to be slum like. If your household income is £2,000 per month and £1,000 is going on rent then priorities are wrong.

I stick to the 33% figure that has been mentioned, although at the moment I'm probably spending 20% or less on my rent. My peak rent outgoings were £1500 a month and although it was worth it (awesome place) I would much rather live in a cheaper place (as I do now) and save the surplus money. Ideally if your rent is &lt;33% of your income your total monthly outgoings relating to housing (eg: utilities, council tax) should come to under 50%, which gives you a great deal of leverage. If you're spending 50% of rent and another 15% on bills you're going to be left with nothing.

An ideal financial situation is one where you're able to save a significant amount of money per month, if you're living month to month then you really need to re-evaluate your situation although if you're a new earner (eg: a graduate) expecting your income to go up it can be *okay*.

It's just that I wouldn't want it to be anything like Tennant's final (and possibly) worst episode where they are being overly dramatic and making it this sad, sad ending. It was embarrassing.

If the Doctor happens to run into Ian who gets caught up in the action, I think that would be a neat take on it.  Or something were the Doctor just happens to run into him somewhere. Ian doesn't see the TARDIS or anything like that, just meets the Doctor (who doesn't introduce himself). The Doctor recognizes him immediately, Ian is curious...he feels like he knows the man, but doesn't recognize the face. The Doctor never reveals who he is, but yeah... something like that. A nice moment with a past companion, nothing crazy.

Past companions? That would be cool. The ""goodbye tour""? Visiting everybody, sobbing like a baby about not wanting to go... no, let's not do that...the least Doctor-like thing you can do. 

People can downvote me all they want, Tennant's finale special was atrocious and just bad from beginning to end. Not even Tennant could save it. If I want to watch someone crying for 20 minutes visiting all their old pals I'd watch a soap opera. It was a shame because Tennant was magnificent and had a fantastic run, but the last two episodes were just... bad.  I hope they give Matt Smith's Doctor a much more dignified and respectable final two episodes.

Options from getting from Gatwick - Train or Coach.  Coach is generally cheaper and lands you in at Victoria Coach station - see:

true,ac_musicgirl,null,null,"I personally think that Eccleston was a great Doctor. He was passionate, intelligent, and brave, but easily irritable and sassy. He had his soft moments. He did a wonderful job being the Doctor that had to face trapping his race in the Time War. He was bitter, but slowly warmed up thanks to the help of Rose and others. He proves that he does care for others, an example being when he sent Rose home to ensure she wasn't going to get hurt fighting the Daleks. The scene with her in the TARDIS watching the hologram was emotional and personally I think it was very moving. I think the reason people didnt like him was because he only stayed for a season; this made it so that he didn't really blossom or devolop as much, and he left just as the show was starting. They don't give him credit because of his short stay, but in my eyes, he brought a lot to the table. 
Now, Tennant is probably my favorite out of the recent Doctors, but he was also my first, So I would probably be a bit more lenient towards him. I think many people like him because a lot of people thought that he was the most attractive of the Doctors at his time. There's always going to be a few folks who watch the show simply because of an actor. The Tenth was brilliant, adventurous, charming and had his silly moments; however, he had great emotional episodes. His acting was strong, and most warmed up to him quickly. 
Now, the Eleventh.... I honestly hated him at first. I thought his entry into the show was rather... Unnesesary. The whole ""I don't want to go"" scene is a tear-jerker for me, because it's so emotionally powerful. Three seasons of being optimistic and saying allons-y, that was a ton of bricks. Then this crazy guy all of a sudden takes his place. I was staring at the television, thinking, why, why would you ruin a beautiful moment like this?? 
I also thought that Smith's Doctor was wry childlike and immature, and sometimes he just got plain dark and creepy. I didn't really like it, and it took me a little while to get used to the dramatic change. I don't like that Amy and Rory stayed with him up until the first part of season 7- but I really like Clara's story, actually. What with Oswin in Asylum of the Daleks- that was a great episode. Other than a few episodes, I don't like how his Doctor was so silly all of the time. I liked it when he acted like a strong leader, a force to be reckoned with. You're not going to get that feeling from a guy who acts like a little kid. 
Also, I know a lot of the teenage girls/adult women watched the show because they thought Matt Smith was attractive. This bothered me, because I never really saw it. I've had too many conversations where they don't know what I'm talking about because they skipped 9 and 10. 


TL;DR: 9 was a great Doctor to begin with, he just didn't stay long enough. 10 was a great Doctor, adventurous and a leader. I didn't like that 11 was so bouncy and crazy. 

These are my opinions, I will not disrespect anyone else's.

Edit: I also feel like in an episode of 11's(maybe Rings of Akhaten? I don't remember) he said a really long speech and I thought I heard something similar in the classics. I'll look for it but I don't remember it. I just remember the last part: ""come on, Clara, there's work to do!"" And the original was with Ace instead. Maybe McCoy said it?

The only pro hate speech argument with any traction is that which argues that hate speech can contribute to an atmosphere of hostility to blacks, gays, or women, and make it more acceptable to physically attack/harass/intimidate them. But then this has the problem of divorcing the responsibility for actions from the person who commits them. Direct incitement to violence should be illegal, but it should be illegal regardless of whether it is racist or not, as indeed it is. And ""indirect incitement"" is a contradiction in terms.

Hate speech as an idea only has traction because racism/sexism/homophobia has replaced sexual/scatological/heretical language as the de facto profanity of our era.",0,1373821785,null,0,false,0,cb2hh29,t3_1i9wkl,t1_cb2hh29,t1_cb2f98z,null,1430470806,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

You voluntarily choose to put yourself in that situation, receiving hate for a physical characteristic is not voluntary. Of course only a white, straight male would make such a comparison.

&gt;some ideas are inherently offensive

Offensive speech != hate speech, obviously people will always be offended by differing view points.

&gt;The only pro hate speech argument with any traction is that which argues that hate speech can contribute to an atmosphere of hostility to blacks, gays, or women, and make it more acceptable to physically attack/harass/intimidate them. But then this has the problem of divorcing the responsibility for actions from the person who commits them.

Again, my definition of hate speech is not an expression of beliefs therefore does not contribute to an atmosphere of hostility in the same way other speech does, offensive ideas may do but as you say it removes responsibility from the individual who commits violence.

&gt;Hate speech as an idea only has traction because racism/sexism/homophobia has replaced sexual/scatological/heretical language as the de facto profanity of our era.

I'd also add that it only makes sense to spend less if you earn much, because you'll be able to save much then (and having savings is a big achievement).

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"You can get the train from Gatwick. There are big signs in the airport for the trains. Croydon is north from Gatwick so get on a train going north into central London. Croydon is however south from Heathrow which is more in central London but I would advise you to fly to Gatwick as otherwise you would have to find your way across London and then get another train south. It's the same line I travel on a lot. There are two companies that run this particular line: First Capital Connect (dark purple trains) and Southern (yellow trains). From personal experience, Southern have nicer, newer trains so if you have a choice use the yellow ones but they both go to the same places so you can take either. There [will be one of these](http://www.atoc.org/clientfiles/images/Imagesforarticles/On-time-departures-board.jpg) on the station platform which will tell you the final destination, time and platform number. If you fly into Gatwick, you can get trains going to London Victoria or London Bridge and these should stop at East Croydon but check each train does before you get on just in case. If in doubt there will be people on the platform to ask. 

You can check train times on [this website](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/); just put in the station you are going from (Gatwick Airport) and going to (East Croydon) and the time of day and it will give you a timetable of all the relevant trains around that time. You can buy tickets at machines in the station or at the ticket office you walk past on the way to the platforms. If you want you can book tickets on the website, pay now and collect the tickets from the ticket machines at the station the day you arrive. They will email you a code [like this](http://i.imgur.com/asYnSYC.png) which you enter into the ticket machine at the station and it prints your ticket. Booking ahead will save you a bit of money but the ticket one-way should cost around £5. Trains will continue until around 00:00 so 22:00 will be fine. 

Don't worry about customs. It is just a long line of desks [that looks like this](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/multimedia/archive/00286/ukborderagencypassp_286894c.jpg). You go up to a desk and give them your passport and they scan it and let you through. Provided your not wanted by Swedish police it will take less than 30 seconds at the desk. There will probably be a queue though as everyone has to do it. EU people are treated the same as UK citizens so [follow these signs.](http://www.standard.co.uk/incoming/article7660233.ece/ALTERNATES/w460/Gatwick+queue) 

You wont need tube tickets. Croydon is slightly outside of London and the tube doesn't extend that far so you can't use it. 

I'm not sure about the bus, sorry. In the rest of london you can buy them on the bus so it's probably the same. 

[Citymapper](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/citymapper-london-transport/id469463298?mt=8) is a good app.  My friend has but i've never used it. It claims to track tube, bus and [the bikes you can hire to cycle around.](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/cycling/14808.aspx)

They will just die out over time. Membership has dropped dramatically over the years see: http://m.newsletter.co.uk/news/regional/orange-order-numbers-in-decline-1-1886073

The young people you see on tv etc are bandsmen. These are not affiliated to the orange order. 

Bands are popular because if you are a kid in a loyalist area, maybe you have no job, prospects, you might be from a single parent family. Being in a band gives you comradeship, a sense of purpose, a lovely uniform to attract the ladies. 

Yes a certain amount of it is lets annoy the taigs but generally they just do it because it gives them a sense of respect and purpose. There is a lot of good in the band culture but they really need to tone down the sectarianism and make it more mainstream. 

When I was at queens I was friendly with a guy in the young unionists. He once said to me ""you Catholics all think we sit around plotting the downfall of popery, in reality they are just arguing over what sandwiches to have on the 12th"".

Yip the orange order is fuckin bizarre with their weird uniforms and extremely dubious interpretation of history (king billy was backed by the pope and he was gay). But for their members it is a social thing. 

Out of 5000 parades only around 6 are contentious. The main problem is the orange order are shite at PR and the sinners run rings around them. 

It suits dissidents to cause trouble in ardoyne. It suits the orange order to cause trouble to make themselves feel relevant.

But despite all that you still don't have the adult self control to avoid further profanity. What are you so angry about?

I'm not sure why you're under the impression I'm angry. I went to sleep last night. Don't take this personally, but I don't care about you enough to stay up all night. That aside, is that a terrible attempt to discredit my argument with ad hominem attacks? And you kept insisting that I wasn't even making a point, yet you'd attempt to rebut it anyway, and then complain about the fact that *I'm* the one attacking your character in place of an argument.

You're a very confused little man, aren't you?

&gt;Anyway, of course people that are freed from the shackles of illegal status can become more economically productive - that's obvious. The POINT is that this group of people are not likely to be the kind if economically productive people that would pass any kind of criteria test - hence one of the big reasons why they are illegal in the first place. So you act of ignorant good will is just a post dated removal of any kind if quality control on immigration. Which is a system that only an incompetent official would design.

So this arbitrary set of hoops immigrants have to jump through just so happens to be the perfect test of a persons' willingness, motivation, ability *and* desire to become economically productive at some point in their life? Please provide some evidence to back up your claim that the majority of illegal immigrants would not be economically productive, if they were allowed to work and study legitimately.

Come on, you're arguing an absolutely stupid point here, and providing nothing to back it up. I'm not even sure you yourself believe this nonsense.

&gt;If you think that points like this are simply people saying ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE TERRIBLE it's just another example of your angry ill informed ignorant ramble.

&gt;Idk why it's called 'making an effort', perhaps it should be called 'being thoughtful' instead. 

Two different things. One is going the extra mile to fix/impress something or someone and the other is an act that shows a person or persons that you care for/about them.

true,ThePaisleyLady,donna,Donna,"Very much agreed.  I have read an article about this very subject, but I cannot remember where.

It made me think also that since Moffat took over, none of the companions have real families.  Rose, Martha, and Donna all had close families who worried about them, and who held The Doctor responsible for their safety.  It meant that the characters had lives outside of The Doctor, which made them more well rounded and realistic.

To me, Amy finally getting her family should have been a MUCH bigger deal.  She had been alone all of her life.  But when she was finally reunited with her parents, she didn't seem to care about them at all, and even seemed a little annoyed that they might hold her back from her travels with The Doctor, even though she never took the time to explain to them who he was.  I know that time had been rewritten, so technically she probably gained memories of growing up with them.  But regaining her memories of The Doctor should have also let her remember her lonely childhood, which I would hope would make her appreciate them more.

And then there is Clara, who loved her parents but was conveniently orphaned.  And while she cares about the children she nannies, it is still just a job.  

No families = a certain ease in letting The Doctor become their entire lives.  Nothing else matters.  They don't even have anything left to go visit.  It might be part of the reason Rory's dad was so popular, for the brief episodes he was a part of the show.  He gets a letter explaining what happened to the Ponds/Williams.  Her family does not.

I am beginning to think that Amy isn't my problem.  Moffat is.  Because although I felt the story of this last season was intriguing, I quickly lost interest in Clara.  She became very bland.  I didn't even pick up on the ""flirting"" which everyone assured me was there.

Ugh.  I hate feeling like something I love and which has become a large part of my life (cosplays, fanart, RPGs, and loads of merchandise) is slipping away from me.  I feel like the show is jumping the shark, and so much of my identity has become wrapped up in being a Whovian that I am too embarrassed to tell anyone in my real life.

We'll get there eventually (God willing) but for now we have to accept that players will see the grass being greener on the other side.  

That being said, I DO have my frustrations about the way he has conducted himself during this transfer window.  If he had just stayed out of the media and privately told BR that he would like to leave, then I'd be more than ok with it happening .  His behavior now though of talking to the media constantly angling for a move is hurting the club in the sense that it could possibly lower any potential transfer fee or (if recent interviews are to be believed) lower morale.  

If Suarez wants to go, then fine.  He's given us two amazing years and kept us afloat practically all on his own.

Did I say this? I don't think I did. Stop building straw-man arguments and thinking you're making brilliant counter-points.

&gt;and as I don't have a recent study to demonstrate a seemingly obvious link between things like *education, work experience, net worth and economic productivity*

All things that illegal immigrants would be able to earn/receive were they granted amnesty, which is exactly my point. It's the *system* that keeps them there, not the fact that ""they're the type of people"" that end up there, as you claim. Provide some evidence if you're going to make these moronic claims, that's all I'm saying.

&gt;(really I have look argue that point. That point?)

I'm not even sure what you're attempting to convey here. Try using spell-check and thinking before hitting save, maybe?

true,[deleted],null,null,"While you make an extremely persuasive argument, we can't just ban them. Despite all the ridiculous 'history' and triumphalism, the Orange Order is fundamentally an organisation about identity, as much as we all hate to admit it. There is an ounce of identity and heritage amongst the shitstorm that is Orangeism, effectively their saving grace, a forcefield which makes the OO invincible to all attempts to do away with it.

The next best option would be a reform. When I say reform, I mean making the Orange Order into a completely different organisation. [From their official website,](http://www.grandorangelodge.co.uk/what-is-the-orange-order) the Orange Order claims firstly to be a 'Protestant fraternity.' A reform should get rid of that and make it open to everyone regardless of their religious background. The site explains ""Our name comes from William III, Prince of Orange, whose victory over despotic power laid the foundation for the evolution of Constitutional Democracy in the British Isles'. This should be changed to ""and is kept because of his Act of Settlement which created the first basic form of Constitutional Democracy in the British Isles'. The whole theme of him being a good guy who defeated King James, the baddie, should be scrapped. He should not be presented as someone who gave everyone liberties by defeating the evil Catholics. 

The organisation should be renamed the New Orange Institution. On all its official resources, the new Orange Order should recognise the past affiliations of the Orange Order, but heavily emphasise its modern reinvention as a democratic organisation promoting Prince William's struggles to deliver rights and liberties for all (or however they would phrase it). They should note that while it was an organisation originally set up after the Battle of the Diamond to defend Protestants, it does not serve that purpose today, and it wishes to promote respect for all people of all cultures, and defend the cultural rights of all.

It should also not be a 'patriotic' organisation. The whole reform process will be extremely painful for the Orange Order, but necessary for it to be compatible with modern society. A few people here have commented that the Orange Order has an ageing membership, and they'll all 'die off'. That is a force which will help when pressing for reforms, when there are simply less Orangemen, and more people living in the present, in a modern, secular society.",0,1373837516,null,0,false,0,cb2mly6,t3_1i9x7w,t1_cb2mly6,t3_1i9x7w,null,1430468315,10,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,10

It would be an awful lot cheaper to give the cat to a loving home in italy and get a new cat in the UK. In my experience cats don't always take change very well, at best the 6 or so that I've had seem to tolerate it begrudingly. After all, this is a fiercly territorial animal that won't stray further than a couple of hundred meters from its food and water source. What seems sentimental and loving to humans might be a frightening experience to a cat (like being in the hold of an aircraft for several hours then arriving in a strange land that has different weather, different trees, different birds and animals, different buildings etc.)

I love cats, and I love the cats I've had... but honestly, I'm not sure cats are really capable of reciprocating that. When I've moved cats with me, its been out of convienience to me. I suspect if they *could* have made a choice, it probably would have been to see the back of me and stay where they are. But I don't think cats can really understand love, and I wonder whether they even really understand the concept of time. They seem to just oppourtunistically go with the flow.

Anyway, good luck with whatever you choose! Sorry if that sounded preachy, it isn't meant to be. I had no idea it was so hard to move a cat around the EU. ",0,1373838943,null,0,false,0,cb2n28j,t3_1iah7g,t1_cb2n28j,t3_1iah7g,null,1430468102,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

He did really well at Monaco, and was bought by arsenal where he was in the top 5 strikers in the world. An unbelievable player, even better than the one we saw 2 years ago for us. He had 3 seasons there, and wanted to win trophies, so decided he wanted to move. To be fair, he was treated like shit by the arse fans etc.

At City, he did well in his first season, but was benched for little reason, so he, very understandably, wanted out. He had a spat with Mancini, who doesn't know how to keep a striker happy, and was never played again. Going on loan to Madrid, where he did pretty well, and then to us, where he was sublime.

He's a really, really good player. And you come across as an absolute moron saying what you've just said.

Day 1 :

* Start at the Big Ben by getting out at Westminster tube.

* Walk to Buckingham Palace through St James' Park. I dont know about the changing of the guard, but I think you should at least see the Palace.

* Walk along the Mall to Trafalgar Square. Here you can also visit the National Gallery

* Walk to Covent Garden. Its a 5 minute walk from Trafalgar Sq. I would recommend visiting the Transport Museum while you're there if you can.

* Walk to up Tottenham Court Road to Oxford Street and wander along the length of it. Personally, I dont think it's that special and you'd be as well to head to one of the Westfields if you just want standard shops.

Day 2:

* Go to St Pauls Cathedral, then travel to The Tower of London. I think its awesome just to see from the outside.

* Cross Tower Bridge - I would recommend going up it and seeing the view from the top.

* When on the South Bank, just keep walking West. This will take you past the Tate Modern if you want to visit. You'll eventually get to The London Eye.

You should be able to fit plenty more into this day, including visiting anywhere you passed yesterday, as you'll end up again in walking distance to everywhere you were on day 1.

Day 3:

* Go to Kensington and do all the museums. The V&amp;A is awesome, but so is the Natural History Museum, and the Science Museum. And theyre all free!

Day 4:

* British Museum

I appreciate that I've made Day 1 super busy, but I figure a lot of the things you want to see are very much 'oh look at that, now onto the next thing.' Then leaving space on the other days means you can return to anywhere you've missed out on, instead of rushing around on the last day.

I'd say try to avoid museums and Oxford St on weekends if you can.

Also, [Time Out] (http://www.timeout.com/london) is pretty awesome for listing things that should be seen/done.

I think it was clear we all understood last season was our transitional period and in a lot of ways it was and despite the 7th place finish it was kind of a success. 

**last season**

We survived more than half a season with one striker, we managed to shift a lot of ~~unwanted~~ unneeded players, start to implement the next generation of players into the ranks, establish a better transfer/spending/targeting policy, experiment with formation and style of play and capture some brilliant new young players.. in other words we got all the fundamentals out of the way and now its time to work on the advanced stages of the recovery process.

**20 more goals**

If we want the 20 more goals BR is desperate for us to acquire then we need to be getting them from the midfield/wings, last season Suarez for a long time seemed to be the only person capable of scoring (not entirely true but it certainly felt that way), ideally id like to see more attacking prowess from the wings which is why i feel although pretty green still Ibe and Sterling could/should gradually start to take on that role as they evidently can score, assist and have that drive to fight to the end to prove their worth. 

**Stevie G**

for a while at the start of the season i thought Stevie was showing signs of fading but mid way through the season he came back to life and became dangerous as ever, its going to be interesting to see where he fits in and what role he takes up this season, id like for him to be more attacking orientated

**Keeper wars**

Reina and Simon are going to create a looooot of competition for each other.. it's going to be interesting to see what the outcome is because there's no way Reina will be happy becoming second string and yet Simon will be doing all he can to take that number 1 spot, I personally think for this season anyway Reina will stay as first choice but fueled by competition for his place he becomes a lot like the player he once was in his glory days and fueled by his desire to take the 1st spot simon even though lacking in playing time continues to train and improve 

**suarez** 

does he have the right to leave? after all he did for us last season there is nothing we can really do to repay him, but for all the negative light he put upon himself and the club some would argue that he owes us. 

if he stays then I know he'll still play 110% of his ability in an attempt to get us into the top 4 and CL, if he goes ill be devastated but i dont think the club will allow it and besides nobody but the club and suarez know whats really going on despite all reports

when he got suspended at the end, i noticed a lot of players particularly sturridge take on the 'just put it in the net' attitude and it worked very well for him and although you could still see certain players still scouting for suarez when near or in the both (especially enrique who looked lost when there was no suarez to pass to) the whole team started to almost accept the fact that they have to create the chances themselves ",0,1373844588,null,0,false,0,cb2ou6v,t3_1ial47,t1_cb2ou6v,t1_cb2o3wq,null,1430467264,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,Nark2020,null,null,"According to various people, notably the blog Harry's Place and associated writers, and presumably Twelvebore here, the entire left wing of British politics including UAF are all sympathisers with Islamism. 

So, when you see people from Respect or Stop The War doing a protest against, say, the Iraq war, their real agenda is to bring in Sharia law, chop off women's heads and kill all the Jews. Same for anyone who's against Palestinian or Lebanese kids being bombed to pieces by the Israeli airforce: there are no pro-Palestinians who are not also anti-semites who want to push all the Israelis into the sea. 

The people who hold this view of the left fall into several broad categories: right wing fifth columnists trying to discredit the left, people who like causing controversy for the sake of it, people who used to be on the left until they fell out with their friends and went the other way, and some well-meaning liberals. 

Quite a lot of them are people who supported the Afghan and Iraq wars: those wars haven't gone quite as they expected. In order to avoid the cognitive dissonance, they have to try and claim the moral high ground back from the left by making these various accusations.  

It's a cock-eyed view of politics, because it assumes that all wrongs are equal. So that if some academic, say, criticises Israel using some clumsy language (e.g. 'Jewish money'), that person is just as bad as someone from the EDL who likes getting a gang together and chucking bricks through corner shop windows. 

But it's a popular view, especially on the internet.

We went out on a 16 mile bike ride (not so fun for me as the bike was my dads and didn't fit me and had mountain bike tyres on rather than road tyres, and apparently the front tyre was on backwards and the brake pads were in the wrong position so constantly rubbing against the wheel....basically a combination of things which made it extra hard for me, especially as I was the most unfit of the group and there were a lot of hills, grr), then my sis and I had a shower with the hosepipes they use to wash down the horses after they race. It was bloody freezing but very refreshing. We had to shower in our sports bras and running/cycle shorts though but it did make it look like we'd taken part in the triathlon a little as they were using the horse showers too. Then we went to the pub for a couple of pints (cycling back was fun...), ate dinner and the adults danced around to old music on the dancefloor. Camped there overnight, which was fun but very uncomfortable. 

Today we went to Brinham Rocks and my sis and I were scrambling around and climbing on them, then we came home.

Many people think grammar schools / private schools are *only* for the posh and snobbish, and they don't want their kids to turn out like that, but it's not really the case.

Just because it happens in some places doesn't mean it happens to everyone. The orange order has brings no trouble in loads of locations, for example in Lisburn the 12th went very peaceful, the lodges who held the 12th cleaned up the field after them.

I disagree with parades going into Catholic areas, why would you want to parade in front of people from those areas? New routes should be made to go through the places that want them and will enjoy them.

Also what about the Republican parades, bonfires etc? You mention everything here but those, why not ban those as well?

This ""Share future"" really gets to me, all I do see is the government picking away at the protestant culture. In order for a ""shared future"" to happen I think we need a complete reform of the bigots within the government. SF and the DUP just pick at each other, I don't vote but if I did why would I vote for someone who has killed someone previously, spent time and got out on the Good Friday agreement? Why would I vote for someone who get super injunctions to hide the truth?

OO would be the last place to reform this country.

What should be done with the OO: Ban alcohol? I remember when I used to watch the 12th as a child and you'd walk up to the field for some sandwiches and an orange juice... Now you walk up for a beer to be pissed up the wall later that evening and I would say alcohol is why so much shit happens.
