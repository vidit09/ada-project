Obviously this article, being a Birmingham newspaper is trying to stir things up a little bit.

Birmingham council will have enough homeless of its own so wont be thrilled about those being displaced from London, but its unlikely they will have a duty house most of them.

The Laws around duty to provide accommodation are reasonably straightforward.

Once a decision has been made and duty has been ended there is no further duty until there is a material change in circumstances.

So for the people in the article who are intentionally homeless once Newham stops paying the B&amp;B no further duty is owed to them from either London or Birmingham.

The pregnant girl when its determined that she is owed full housing duty this is still the responsibility of Newham – likely that they will house her in private rented in Birmingham (so still a strain on services in Birmingham)

Regardless, not every school serves food to the same standard, and being forced to eat school dinners, is, frankly, absurd. It's not going to help - Schools regularly have unhealthy things on offer, and little in the way of vegetarian options. Not the least, kids with food allergies are going to have a much harder time.

So long as the kids can get to chose what they want to eat in school, there's nothing stopping them from just getting the ""bad"" foods on offer and getting none of the ""good"". When I was in high school there were plenty of days that I got nothing but chips. 

I ate far better when I left the school premises, because the school food just wasn't very good. They had a lot of options, but all of it felt like it was frozen and just warmed up. There were plenty of sandwich shops and other things in my town, so I ate far better then - sure, I also had sweets, I'd buy a bottle of Dr Pepper and maybe a pack of sweets or two, and in hindsight, I often had too much, really, but I had better meals, more filling meals, by not eating in school.

Primary school, sure, we had good meals, but my high school was not good. I mean, it wasn't horrible - some of the stuff tasted ok, but it wasn't worth half the price.

Unless they can attest to a decent standard of meals, and ensure that every pupil eats a balanced meal, and isn't able to just cherry pick certain items from the menu, they're making things far worse. This is of no benefit to children - perhaps in some outlying cases where the parent gives the child 4 chocolate bars and a bag of crisps, but then, if they are what this is trying to solve, why are they, specifically not being targeted - also, does anyone *actually* do that?

In the school I went to, the packed lunches other kids had always seemed nice, and there were kids ranging from the poorest of people to some very wealthy. The ones that tended to eat the worst were the ones, like me, that got school dinners - because it was like a buffet type system, you pick and choose from everything on offer, and then pay for what you got at the end, I would often end up with, frankly, not great meals. Primarily because, I have no idea how, but all of the vegetables were like rubber.

I'm not talking about a lifetime ago, either, 9 years ago, and 4 years ago for my little brother, and he had a similar experience. Granted, this is all anecdotal, and it's in one school - but the point remains, unless you can set a nationwide standard, and ensure that they are followed, and then additionally ensure that you always have alternatives for people with food allergies and those that are vegetarian and so on, you're going to be making things worse. I find it hard to believe that this would be an improvement, overall.

When I have kids, I will be giving them packed lunches because you can make sure your child is eating properly. No one at the school is going to go personally to every single pupil and make sure they eat their food.

Edinburgh's population doubles - and it's not a big city really, so the infrastructure and facilities (buses, roads, litter bins, restaurants, cafes etc) all end up failing or being too crowded to use.

There are some gems in the shows, I'll admit, but at least 60% of it is guff... though nobody likes to really admit it.  It'd be nice if there was at least some quality control on submissions.

Then there's the marketing - giant racks of posters everywhere, flyers (oh God, the flyers!) and 'quirky' teams of marketeers selling their amazing, vibrant 'one of a kind' show (*warning*: may not be quirky, amazing, vibrant or 'one of a kind' - in fact, if you have to big up the sell, it's probably terrible).  About 80% of these flyers end up in the gutter, or in overflowing bins (see previous comment about infrastructure collapsing).

Then there's the Tattoo - because everyone loves late-night bagpipes, gunfire, flyovers and fireworks in their back garden 7 nights a week for 4 weeks.

Add to that the general 'Saturday night' vibe 7 days a week - fun if you're able to take part... but with drunk folk, noisy clubs with 5am licences, and the general 'it's not our city and we're here to party - someone else can deal with the aftermath' feeling you get from a huge number of visitors, crap if you're trying to sleep.

Oh and don't forget the bonus STDs and increase in crime rates - 30% increase in reported STD cases in the 3 months after the fringe has left town, and an increase in crime overall...

*TL;DR* Try getting up for work in the morning when you've not slept due to drunk parties, get on a bus which is late and full of confused tourists, go through a city that's gridlocked and covered in litter, to a workplace that's surrounded by people flyering you with garbage to work at a desk when there's all the fun (and noise) of the fair outside your window, where your favourite sandwich place has an impassable queue out the door, then find your after-work pub is full of loud, inane showbiz types, and there's nowhere 'quiet' to go for a lie down, and you start to hate it.

Still *TL;DR* - It's a big shit actually.

Those parents who are going to make the effort to give their children a healthy and nutritious lunch shouldn't be forced to let them have school dinners. But those parents are a tiny minority. Most are happy to let the school dinner or Mr Kraft take care of their kids' nutrition for them. It's not fair on those children who get shitty packed lunches because they have lazy parents.

true,Galerath,null,null,"The mortgages which kick started the problem were insane, we're talking about 99% mortgages sold to people with bad credit. The banks, when they provide a mortgage, are not offering an off the shelf service, they're supposed to be making an investment which is then bundled into a CDO and sold on to investors.

What the banks worked out was that they could collude with the rating agencies to get AAA ratings on high interest, unsecured loans and mortgages, and sell them on at a premium. This encourages lower agents on the securitisation chain to push people to take out bad debts. 

The result was people who were not in a good financial position were either tricked through fraud or heavily encouraged through marketing to sign up to these mortgages.

Now the question is, who do you blame?

A: The people who took out mortgages they were told they could afford to purchase their dream home in the mistaken belief that the house prices would keep rising? (I.e. the uninformed consumer)

B: Bankers and regulators who worked together to encourage a situation where uninformed consumers and investors were being shafted in the name of short term profits?

Of course the answer will depend on whether you are 'Left' or 'Right' wing. The Left will blame B, the Right will blame A, because the Right make the demand that all consumers be informed consumers.

Others will say that they should be free to protest, and punishing them is a thinly veiled attempt at stifling the right to protest.

All I know is that the law states that they need to be arrested for trespass, no two ways about it. Fortunately for them, this also serves to strengthen their protest because it brings even more public attention to them and their cause.

Furthermore, they had to know that they would be arrested for this act of ""civil disobedience"". And they still went ahead with it anyway. So at the very least, they've raised my awareness of the their cause (*although I don't necessarily agree with their point of view*) and they have my respect for performing such a cool stunt, fearless of the personal consequences to themselves.

If they had performed a stunt that was more physically disruptive, like blocking the London underground from running during rush hour, or something that actually endangered lives other than their own, then I would have a totally different reaction. But in this case, as far as I know, they have not endangered anyone but themselves, and the disruption they have caused is minor.

Also, they remind me of that ""spider-man"" guy in New York (I think?) who was climbing buildings (illegally) without any rope/harness assistance.

This is one of the worse parts in my opinion. It seems like the government are doing more and more to put state schools at a disadvantage to academies, pushing these schools to become academies just so they don't have to put up with these stupid rules (and get a decent amount of funding, like one of the secondary schools near me did). 

It's ridiculous. They'll decrease the quality of state schools on purpose and then use to as a reason why academies are better.

Both Traoré and Yun appeared to be quite involved in the final third, so I had a bit of optimism spike that we might become competent down the left flank when August comes, but no sense getting too worked up over a pre-season game, and after 90 minutes we hadn't produced a goal. I'd like to see what Yun and Traoré could do at the same time, with the latter playing in MF.

true,hexapodium,null,null,"Oh, undoubtedly prison meals (at a cost of something like 74p per meal on ingredients, I seem to recall) are better than school meals. Prison food is often prepared in-house by people who'll have to eat it later, as opposed to being reheated prepackaged stuff supplied by contractors. Plus, malnutrition in prisons would be a major crisis: they're already not the healthiest environment, and feeding people well is among the cheapest ways to cut most incidence of disease. With kids in school, it's only one meal a day, so it can be justified if it's less nutritious than the cardboard it arrives in on cost grounds, and the effect is masked on all but the poorest kids, whose poor health is then blamed entirely on the parents. If that happened in prisons, there would be no diffuse scapegoat to blame, and a bunch of awkward inquests and things would happen.

The simple reality is that for the very poorest kids, a subsidised school meal might be the only time in the day they're sure of getting any food at all - particularly with the rise in food poverty we're seeing at the moment. It *should* be a no-brainer to say that school meals should be  healthy and tasty first, and cheap as a next consideration. Then you can probably also embark on programmes like offering kids on FSM a subsidised or free breakfast at school as well, since the stats point to hungry children being one of the groups who most underperform relative to ability. 

In terms of packed lunches, I suspect the trick is to resort to market forces: expand free school meals so that any child who wouldn't be able to afford a school dinner rather than a packed lunch, now can (which is not the case at the moment, there's something of a 'lunch trap' particularly for bigger families, since FSMs are assessed by household income not income + number of kids in school), subsidise all meals to the point where they only slightly exceed the average cost of a packed lunch. At this point it becomes perfectly reasonable to choose either on cost grounds, or provide a packed lunch for special dietary/religious requirements. Though ideally schools should be able to deal with just about every exclusion short of air-veganism.

The other side of the deal should be an attempt to stop people buying four portions of chips for lunch - a 'package meal' option that at least makes kids receive a relatively balanced meal. Enforced eating of everything is awful though, and is demonstrated to be how children develop a hatred of particular foods into adulthood.

I've now corrected my usage to the more general definition and I'm using ""JSA"" instead of the programme's use of ""benefits"".

Since you seem to be having difficulty with this, let me spell it out for you.  The programme was using ""benefits"" synonymously with ""jobseeker's allowance"".

Also, if you want to use the term ""pension-age benefits"" rather than ""pensions"", then go right ahead.

This is my point: JSA is 3% of the welfare budget.

Family are not sectarian, though slightly Republican. I'm now living in London. This year is the first year I won't be living in Belfast during the 12th.

The 12th is a disgusting and hateful period every year. It's a celebration of an Age old division and promotes distrust and sectarianism for both sides. Town centres close and nobody can go to work, Northern Ireland takes the day off and if you are a Catholic in Northern Ireland, you have to find something to do during the day because you certainly won't be going to the Marches.

Every year they are billed as being inclusive to everyone, but when you have [local politicians](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-23089437) saying that it's OK for a culture to celebrate flag burning, you know there's a problem.

The people in Northern Ireland who still stick to the Tribalism will never let the country evolve beyond that, either as part of the UK or part of Ireland. Issues like Jobs, Hospitals and the Economy are lesser problems to these people. 

What happened when a major Belfast Hospital had it's Accident and Emergency department planned to be cut? [100 people protested](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-14322505).

The benefits system is a total joke. There's supposed to be a social security net to catch you if you fall, but there's almost no help at all.

With regards to housing benefit/local housing allowance, I'm entitled to all of £253/month. My rent is £525 for an unremarkable one bed flat. This is pretty average here. The £253 I get is because, as somebody under 35, I'm meant to either still be living with my parents or sharing a house? Even if I was sharing a house, £253 is not enough. I've gone through Gumtree and Spareroom.co.uk and all that I could find that met that budget were either student digs, or landlords who specifically said DSS was not allowed. When not even half of my rent is being paid, I don't see how that's contributing to inflated rents asked for by BTL landlords.

Somehow, from my £310/month JSA, I'm supposed to find the £272 difference in rent, and pay bills, and feed myself, and somehow pay for transport to/from interviews.

It's a complete farce. The young are discriminated against.

There shouldn't be. Any employer who lets you do this is breaking the law. Think about what kinds of employer don't mind breaking the law.

If you do this and are caught your employer will be fined, you will be deported, and things will not go well for your wife.

If you assume you've got £0 saved, £0 private pension and £0 other sources of income, you'll be entitled to:

£200/year winter fuel payment

Which totals up to £14,760 of benefits if you assume rent of £100/week and council tax of £25/week. At this level, this is completey tax free (NI and income tax).

We live in relative poverty. All my clothing barring underwear comes from charity shops. We have the utter minimum in personal belongings.  We haven't been away on holiday in ages and probably won't again for a while either.

true,TheFreemanLIVES,irish,Daaaarby Duck,"&gt; The people who are most loyal to Britain are the people who are under threat. Consequently, the Falklanders, Gibraltans and **Northern Irish protestant** who fear being forced out of the country to join another where they would be an extreme minority with negligable electoral impact make a concerted effort to identify themselves as being extremely British and loyal to make the rest of us see a distinct difference between them and 'foreigners'. It is also important to highlight the fact that they care as deeply about remaining British as **Northern Irish Catholics** 'might' care about joining Ireland.

For a start, losing the Sectarianism might make you seem a little less alien. I can't speak for Scotland or Wales, but assume they are the same as England in that they have worked extremely hard to reduce and marginalize all forms of discrimination so their new multicultural societies won't tear apart at the seams and so people can simply get on with living in peace and safety. Ironically enough, SF is fully aligned with this multicultural agenda, and quite possibly less alien to the modern UK than loyalists now are.

This then excludes anyone who cannot afford to work such a low paying job. We have developed a culture where business think its ok to pay people fuck all.


Companies should be made to pay a real livable wage to their employees that does'nt have to be supplemented with benefits or foodbanks, and yes some of these companies are small and could not afford to pay staff more, but maybe those companies could be given a stipend so they don't get used to paying very little and the employee doesn't need to claim benefits. However many of them are huge companies who pay their staff minimum wage and on top of that take slave labour through workfare, this means that big companies get to be successful and destroy their competition of small businessmen who don't receive slave labour.


edit: Another key problem. What were these people claiming the most benefits and spending the most money on? Housing. If we actually built houses and a decent house cost a reasonable amount of money and rents came down we could spend less money of housing benefit and people would be able to afford to work a low paid job. But do we build quality houses at the rate we need them? Fuck no, most of the rich people in this country make a huge amount of money from land and property. They want to control the supply so they can keep prices high. Who are the biggest buyers of new properties? People who are going to rent them out because most people cannot afford it.

You could frame this situation as landlord profiteering from housing benefit rather than viewing the people on benefits as scroungers. So another thing you could do to solve the rent problem is (and this would be very mean to poorer people for a while) is to severely reduce housing benefit, this would mean people wouldn't be able to rent houses at the current market price, therfore if landlords wanted to make money they would have to drop their prices to keep the houses occupied.

I would 100% send in the life insurance documents, I think that's a very good piece of evidence, also when getting letters from friends/family I'd place friends with so called trustworthy jobs as a much higher priority.

You could also frame this situation as the landlords profiteering from housing benefit, rather than viewing the people on benefits as scroungers. So another thing you could do to solve the rent problem is (and this would be very mean to poorer people for a while) to severely reduce housing benefit.

The position they were in when they beat Arsenal at White Hart Lane in March: at that stage I never thought for a minute they wouldn't get into the top four. But losing Sandro was a big problem for them and set them back. They also needed more back-up at centre-forward and there was a heavy reliance upon Gareth Bale, and that ended up costing them. Even so, it was generally a pretty good performance from Tottenham. Yet you always wonder if they've got it in them to go again, to spend big or get the players in required to make that breakthrough.

&gt;Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City will all be there. So you're talking about Arsenal – who will be better next season, and will eventually sign two or three players to take them forward – Liverpool and Tottenham competing for that final spot. Last year was the bigger opportunity for Spurs to reach the top four, more than this year. This year could be tougher. It goes without saying that, if they lose Bale, that would be a massive blow. But the noises at the moment are that Tottenham are not willing to sell and he is not wanting to leave. So that is promising.

With regards Lennon, I think his work rate has improved massively in the last couple of seasons. He provides so much support to Walker its unreal. I did vote for him in last seasons Player of the Year awards and genuinely believe he deserves greater recognition.

Walker is a funny one, he impressed in his first full season, but last one was poor for him. Perhaps he takes too much solace in the fact that Naughton is no great threat to his place in the side. Would like to Adam Smith get a chance though.

(A floating license is a license for a piece of software (Lets say an E-book) which has a limited number of copies BUT once someone stops using it, it becomes available to someone else. You could pay a software company a £100k or so to make the CDS which would allow people to use that, reduce the staff of a centralised city library and have one or two dedicated to the loaning of a book. (Basic idea, someone submits a request on the software for a particular book from a library. They see the request and see how 
many books are loaned out, they then authorise it for a certain length of time and upon the time limit running out the software de-authorises the book.

Its financial independence, a complete accident of history, also helps.

The public school boy humour and investigative flair have always lived side by side, and it is to Hislop that we owe the continued existance of the later (he convinced Paul Foot to return to the Eye after taking up the Editorship from a kamakarzi Ingrams.)

The strength of the Eye, and why it's investigations are so good, is that if I call up to blow the whistle on my boss I know they will go to prison rather than betray my trust.

true,cxsmith,null,null,"I'm a bit late to this thread, but if you've still not arrived I will try to help with the Edinburgh side of things.

* Edinburgh Castle - in the very centre and commanding views of the entire city, as well as having lots of stuff to look at inside and numerous different buildings, some several centuries old. Nowhere near free though, as another poster suggested. Adult tickets are £16

* The Royal Mile - street running from the Castle to Holyrood Palace (also worth a visit). Unfortunately there are far too many shops selling rubbish souvenirs, but the High Street in particular is amazing during the Festival(s)

* The Botanic Gardens in Inverleith (worth walking through Stockbridge to get there) - lots of nice trees, at least one rock garden, greenhouses with exotic plants, and best of all it's free entry. Inverleith park just across the road is also very nice, and you get a great view of the city centre from there

*Arthur's Seat - one of the many hills in the city, just around the corner from the Palace and you can easily climb to the top. Very peaceful and despite its location it feels quite removed from the city

*Galleries - there are numerous galleries in the city. At the bottom of The Mound there are two gallery buildings linked underground and there's a big gallery on Queen Street, about a five minute walk from The Mound. The Dean Village has the Gallery of Modern Art and is worth visiting in its own right. There are also some smaller galleries dotted about

*Edinburgh Zoo - animals, including pandas

*Scottish Parliament - bottom of the Mile. Ugly on the outside, nice inside

*Museums - several in the city centre, but the biggest and best is on Chambers Street. Has recently re-opened after being closed for renovation for several years

*Princes Street Gardens - below the castle, nice on a sunny day though also very busy.

Edinburgh is a fairly small city and you could easily see all of those places by walking from the city centre, maybe apart from the zoo which is a bit further out. However, you can buy a day ticket on any Lothian bus for £3.50 and get on as many buses as you like for the rest of that day. The 22, for example, cuts right through the middle of the city; the 35 travels most of the Royal Mile (bottom to High Street); and the 26 will take you to the zoo. They're also mostly quite nice and clean and all easily accessible for those with mobility problems. Of course if you've already been you may know all of this already.

Edit - a few more things. Calton Hill, the Scott Monument (highest monument to a writer anywhere in the world, apparently) and St Giles Cathedral are also worth visiting.

The above however, does not mean a person is necessarily innocent. Is it right to compensate guilty people with public money for effectively not having a crystal ball?

People should have to prove innocence to a similar degree to receive compensation, otherwise we'll pay out more to the bad guys that got lucky than the genuine victims or miscarriages of justice.

I can't speak to all authorities, but where I live borders two separate ones - so I use libraries provided by different councils. Both those councils require applicants wanting to get council housing to use online bidding services - generally they ""release"" the properties at 8AM on a specific day [Tuesday, I think], which people then bid on. If everyone has to use a centralised library that creates a cost disincentive, as well as pressure on the resources within that library.

Then there's the [eventual] rollout of Universal Jobmatch and Universal Credit, which will necessitate regular access to online services. See the argument above.

Keep in mind guys Lucas's standing among his teammates, he is more vocal than Agger, and has become a father figure for many of the foreign players.  Everyone loves Lucas, and his attitude and work rate really epitomizes our club.

Agger would make a fantastic captain, he's shown that with Denmark.  But I personally think the new VC will be Lucas Leiva.

In fact, it is far easier to get the necessary nutrients into a cooked meal – even one of mediocre quality. Only 1% of packed lunches meet the nutritional standards that currently apply to school food.

[Straight off their website](http://www.schoolfoodplan.com/plan/)

From their longer version:

&gt;The vast majority of packed lunches are simply not nutritious enough. That is not a matter of opinion, but of empirical fact. Research published in 2010 by Dr Charlotte Evans of Leeds University revealed that only 1% of packed lunches meet the overall nutritional standards that currently apply to school food (see chart below). A random sample of 1,000 packed lunches found that 85% contained sandwiches, while two thirds contained sweets, sugary drinks and savoury snacks such as crisps. Only one in five contained the recommended proportion of vegetables. 

I believe the survey they cite is found here: http://jech.bmj.com/content/64/11/977.short

Essentially: ""1.1% of packed lunches met the food-based standards for school meals in England"" - i.e. those the schools have to adhere to.

I'm not trying to claim that teaching is an 80 hour week every week (though there will be some weeks where it is), but it's a darned sight more than 40.

She will then on average do 1-3 hours of work every evening as well as spending most of the day on Sunday doing various bits of paperwork.

Classrooms need to be set up before the children arrive and tidied after they leave. Many children do not leave promptly. Then there are after-school clubs which teachers are expected to run. Not to mention staff meetings that they are expected to attend.

Lunch is 1 hour but she doesn't get an hour as she often has to use part of her lunch break to tidy up after the children and set up the classroom again for the afternoon lessons. On average she spends 30 mins eating lunch, often at her desk doing planning or marking. That's not to mention children take time to leave the classroom. believe it or not, they DON'T all fly out the door as soon as the bell rings.

Non-NQT staff at my other half's school do indeed get half a day toward s planning but if staff are off sick or out, teachers are expected to cover in their ""non-contact time"". Teachers are regularly sent on ""training"" courses, many of which are pointless box ticking exercises in themselves.

Then there's the marking, the setting of individual targets for many children for some pieces of work, the lesson planning and target setting for each lesson, the creation of resources for lessons, the ""levelling"", which is another paperwork heavy, ongoing assessment process, the mentoring of TAs and students plus the paperwork that entails, the yearly reports plus additional paperwork for children with special needs.

So Benteke has more (and better) Premier League experience, while Soldado has more overall consistency. It can be sort of summed up by saying Benteke is more proven in the league, while Soldado is more proven overall. Benteke is younger. As for loyalty, I see four or five scenarios:

1) We have a poor season, Benteke more or less repeats his performance: Bale leaves, he probably leaves

2) We have a good season, Benteke more or less repeats his performance: he most likely stays

3) We have a great season, Benteke more or less repeats his performance: he stays

4) We have any kind of season, Benteke has an average one: he stays

5) We have any kind of season, Benteke has a poor one: he stays, or we look to sell 

Obviously I limited these to what I thought were the five most likely scenarios. If he's *significantly better* then he's probably more likely to leave, but that's tough to say, because if he's great, we're probably great too. He also seems to perceive the club as more than a stepping stone, but again I'm not him. So who knows.

When the group was at Winter Quay, Rory was *intended* to be zapped by an Angel at the Quay and used as good in the farm.  The old Rory is the intended consequence.

HOWEVER:  Rory, knowing his fate, creates an intentional paradox that would prevent him from being zapped at the Quay.  He kills himself first- the paradox arising from the fact that he cannot witness himself die, and then die again a few minutes later.

This paradox destroys the Angels' farm and poisons them all, and the universe resets time to the most stable state before the paradox arose.  This is when the group is in the graveyard at the end.  

One angel managed to survive, and is the one which sends Rory and Amy back.  This is NOT the same zap which caused us to see Old Rory- that timeline was erased with the creation of the paradox.

I was meant to go to a book launch at work tonight for part of my job (rather, the handing over of it) but there were some major work related dramas this afternoon and I was full of cannot be arsed-ness come 6pm, so I went to Waitrose instead, where I spotted a vast number of tall, good-looking men all crowded around the cheese section looking mightily confused. Ladies, North London, 6.30pm on a Friday night: you know where it's at: start reading up on your cheeses. 

Tomorrow there's too much to choose from. A couple of friends are putting on some bands and a barbeque and then there will be dancing til 3/4am and there will be lots of people there that I love and haven't seen for a while. These nights are always major fun. Then there's a friend's monthly club night and I bloody adore this particular night (but not the sauna-like temperature); just had a text from friend demanding I come to an all day festival if I have nothing to do tomorrow (and I notice I have music buddies in at least two of the bands playing, one of whom I've been promising to go and see live for, erm, at least two years now - but frankly, the lineup sounds hipster as FUCK, so, I dunno). Finally, on my way home I spotted an NBA thing going on not far from me, and I really quite fancy that too. Idk what the deal is around how to get in etc though.

I may just sack the lot off and stay indoors and watch films instead. Because I always do that instead of partying, right.

Sigh. We all know how this is going to end. 

In the meantime I have nice food and some surprisingly palatable Riesling while I try to make my mind up.

Do these useless jobs keep the economy moving? If by that you mean they allow the super rich to maintain their hegemony, then yes. 

There is no need for someone to work in a job if they are raising children. The only reason people have to do that is because of policies that were put in place to make people have to work more and more hours to maintain a decent standard of living. It is artificially the case. Until the seventies only one person in a couple had to work in order to support a family. 

In the modern world there is no reason we couldn't all do just ten hours a week of work to keep society going. Even that might be surplus so those who would like to occupy themselves with raising offspring or doing something less well defined could be allowed to do that.

It happening again after the fix is going to make airlines seriously lose all confidence in this plane. If this happens in the air though you're talking a possible burning plane falling out of the sky from a known issue. 

Boeing must be seriously bricking it right now. And then some. 

Also the article says: The two batteries are not used when the 787 is in flight.

Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought the whole point of these batteries was to save fuel during a flight by not using the engine bleed to power essential electrical systems.

The boeing 787 reflects a completely new

There's no doubt others could wear the armband (i.e. Vertonghen, Lloris, Kaboul), but those are the three AVB chose last season, aside from the now departed Billiam Gallas.

It will be interesting to see who AVB makes his vice-captain this season as he seems to lean towards players who have served the club longest.  Thus, I could see Azza wearing the armband, but wouldn't rule out Vertonghen or Kaboul if they prove their worth as leaders in the preseason.

The fact is they want the best product possible, and if adding paul to that would help then they'd be for it. They're all massive fans of the show in that respect(colin baker even writes doctor who in his spare time).

The fact is that the Eighth Doctor has had to earn just about all the success he gets in that respect(he became the star of big finish in the main range for his sales, earning his own ""eighth doctor adventures"" range and now gets his own boxed sets) and with only one tv adventure I'm 100% sure they wouldn't begrudge him that.

Besides all that, but he has the most off screen story to fulfill anyways, and because of how his character has been chosen, the production values of the tv movie, and indeed many of the longer running things that were added to the continuity from the eighth doctor's ""era"" and beyond, the eighth doctor is just as rooted in new who was he is classic.",0,1373663354,null,0,false,0,cb1fljv,t3_1i1kg2,t1_cb1fljv,t1_cb1f28v,null,1430488831,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

**SO...**, I would conclude the fire was probably not directly related to the recent lithium-ion battery issues and is due to something else.

Directly below where the fire seems to have been focused is the crew berth and below and to the rear of that is the galley -- though again a galley fire would have to be pretty massive to stretch up to that part of the tail.

I'm just spit-balling here, but my instant guess is someone was doing something they shouldn't have been in the crew berth... edit: although reports say the aircraft was empty at the time. Perhaps something was left in the crew berth?

These are all functions that are typically in use while on the ground (or when the engines are either off or have failed).

HOWEVER, if you read my other post, the position of the scorch marks is not consistent with a lithium-ion battery fire (which would be centred around the rear cargohold door instead of the tail). Infact, the scorch marks are right below the crew berth and galley... my guess is either a galley fire (pretty unlikely considering those things are obsessively engineered from the ground up with safety in mind) or someone was doing something dodgy in the crew berth... infact, the more I look at the closeups the scorch marks seem like an almost perfect map of the crew berth.

Here is a picture of the inside of the berth - http://www.nycaviation.com/newspage//wp-content/gallery/up-close-with-uniteds-first-boeing-787-dreamliner/united-24.jpg it's crawling height only, but you can see how big a fire would have to be if it started in the galley (which is beneath this space) to penetrate through to the surface of the plane.

true,megamouth2,,Jagerbombs and/or sherry and/or Desperados and/or G&amp;T,"&gt; Also, the Aussie bowler who scored 98 runs as a Number 11, breaking a world record, Ashton Agar, is the next big thing, I think

The thing is... I agree, but only up to a point. His placement in the batting line-up seemed to reek of: ""Huh. Here's this new kid. Dunno if he can bat. We'll stick him in at 11,"" so I'm wondering if his achievement is really as good as it's portrayed to be. Or maybe I'm just jealous because my top score at number 11 is around 7*, and my batting average is probably around 5. But... anyway, let's also not forget that Broad was tossin' 'im lollipops for most of his innings.

Still, though, it's made me think that teams should be more strategic with the batting order. Why not put in a guy who can actually bat at number 11 to stop a potential collapse? Especially if, like England's top order, form isn't really on your side. Granted, Trott's got a good average [over 50 in both test and ODI cricket], but Cook's not been able to have the same success he had before he became captain. 

And while we're on the subject of batting... it's sad that England haven't had a *really* good keeper-batsman since Alec Stewart. ",0,1373668010,null,0,1373668676,0,cb1h7s9,t3_1i68r1,t1_cb1h7s9,t3_1i68r1,null,1430488057,1,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,1

Good. Edinburgh isn't a 'party' city; those that want to get mad wi' it every night of the week can go to Glasgow, and quite frankly, I'd rather keep it that way.  

I live and work here because I love the city - I didn't come here for the screaming pubs and thumping clubs. If you want to impress folk with Edinburgh's vibrancy, I would suggest going somewhere in the New Town, like George st, instead of milling about the picturesque Old Town. Listed buildings rarely make for an impressive sight at 2am - must be the lack of coloured lights.

FWIW, I've seen better comedians for free than some of the Big Names during the festival (or outwith as a matter of fact), and I've had amazing fun going to local gigs and seeing local bands. 

Basically Edinburgh is what you make it and as another commenter pointed out, its the company that makes for an amazing night out - not the venue. Edinburgh is full of incredible secret places that are just as vibrant - hidden pubs that aren't quite what they seem, comedians that will split your sides without taking a week's wages, local bands that are every bit as incredible as the ones that tour the world. It just takes a bit of exploration and willingness to get out there and experience something more than just the bright lights and thumping bass.

That's what I love about Edinburgh and that's what makes it vibrant for me. Then again different strokes for different folks.

Just don't badmouth the city because its not in festival mode all year round. Glasgow is just a hop across the way for that.

Torres was and still is pretty hench for his size, same with Aguero. That can't be said about Soldado.

For me this is a factor, but the biggest factor for me is that La Liga has much more open football, whilst in the PL you'll find teams parking the bus against us, squeezing play, pushing the ball. It's more physically demanding and a little guy like Soldado might not be able to cope.

Then you factor in the goals he scores, which are mostly through balls which he poaches, and we're in even bigger trouble. Look at Bent, quick, great finisher, but that leaves him high and dry in the PL, you need more. That's why Torres, Aguero, Silva, Mata, Cazorla have all succeeded, because they're very good with the ball at their feet and have multiple dimensions to their game.

My local HSBC branch was the one with nothing but machines for depositing and taking money, checks, etc. Two or three employees to advice and help. No tills, no cash registers.

I wanted to close my bank account, so I went to Sainsbury's beforehand and tried to spend as much money as I could, to get my account balance down to zero. I've withdrawn some cash beforehand, so I only had a couple quid left. Got the balance down to 12p. This is where the fun begins.

The guy who was dealing with me closing the bank account said that they don't actually have any cash registers and he can't just take the money. He had to go to the basement, open the main storage vault, open the safe and take 12p from there. He also wrote all the papers, the receipt and shit. Took him at least 15 minutes.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; then sell these houses for way below the market rate entirely to people who intend to live in them

The problem with this is that you can't put constraints on what other people do with their property.

Once someone owns something, they can do what they like with it.

So there's nothing stopping these people from buying the properties and then immediately (or soon after) selling them for profit.

Thus you'd be operating (I think) as no more than a loss-making construction company. 

Just like the big council house sell off (which was a transfer of a massive publicly-owned asset into private hands), your plan offers no longterm benefit.

You're better off keeping the housing in the ownership of your cooperative and renting it out cheaply.

What's the benefit in people owning homes?     
What's the benefit in your contributors helping other people own property?

Note that if you do have substantial amounts of money then the government will help you (although current grants may all be allocated). I think they'll match on around a 50% co-owenership basis, but you need to have proposals in terms of 100+ houses.

true,burukuru,null,null,"Hey mate. This is advice from someone who just bought their big bike so I was on the same boat as you not long ago.

The reason you shouldn't buy your first big bike *new* is money. New ones go for around 6-8k depending on type and this will instantly drop 1k or more in value the moment you buy it. It will be brand new and shiny so if you drop it/scratch it, you will cry and money will pour out of your pockets. Unless you don't mind riding a wreck in which case, might as well buy second hand! And this is always money you can spend on better gear. If money isn't an issue then obviously go crazy!

I've never personally ridden a 250 so am not sure how much power it has; what I do know is I would rather not have anything less than 600 on a motorway. Your trips will take an age, the wind will throw you around, and you'll probably get to your destination rather tired. I rode down from central London to Guilford the other day (30 miles) and was quite happy on the 600.

As for the model choice, the usual advice I hear for beginners is a naked bike, eg. Hornet, Fazer or ER6n. You mention being interested in sportsbikes, I'm going to be picky here and say that a ""Ninja"" 300, CBR250  and probably the CBR500 are not sports per se. I would classify them as faired naked bikes. There is a big difference between a Ninja 600 (ER6f) and a ZX6r. Similarly I think the CBR600 is nothing like the lower models from the recent years. I remember trying out a 2011 CBR125 and it was quite sporty. 2012 was much more upright and resembling the Ninja 125.

That aside, the ER6f aka Ninja 650r are very good bikes. I know two people who own them and they are quite happy with it overall. They are quite upright in position and have a fair amount of fairing as well as screen to protect you from wind on longer rides. Do be wary of recalls on the 2010 model as it bit someone I know in the backside recently:
http://londonbikers.com/forums/1018366/kermit%27s-sick--post-sales-trader-experiences
http://www.autoevolution.com/news/kawasaki-issues-2010-er-6f-recall-22733.html

If you want to go full sport, the ZX6R and CBR600f/r/rr will be quite a feat for long journeys. the 600f is the most comfortable of all apparently and I still get a bit achey on some journeys. Having said that, some people swear by them, and even go touring on them so YMMV!

And remember, the bike only goes as fast as you twist the throttle and it will be nothing like a 125. I went from a YBR to a CBR600f3, with about 2 years riding experience on the YBR; haven't had an off yet so it seems it should be OK if even I can do it! You will have to relearn a lot of things but if you're careful, it should be fine. I would say, see how you feel on the DAS, if you can do it on a 600, try that. If you feel uncomfortable with the power, then step up to a 250/300 first.

Hope that helps.",0,1373671799,null,0,false,0,cb1ie8m,t3_1i6om0,t1_cb1ie8m,t3_1i6om0,null,1430487500,2,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,2

Is that because a lot of stuff is americans/australians which don't have as good motorcycle testing? Our CBT seems much more in depth than thier MSF and some states don't even require a full test right?

I party like its '99 and have no cares as to your partying ways, but its not a party if it happens every night.

\*sigh* Yes I have been up to town at night, Old Town and New. There's a fuckton of bright, multi-coloured lights in the New Town and significantly less in the Old. However this view is subjective etc etc, not arguing about this.

Again my personal opinion is that there are *way* more clubs in New Town than Old - though I think they try to swank it up by calling themselves bars as opposed to straight out clubs (which Old Town tends to do). I would however say that (again, subjective view) there are more pubs in the Old Town. The classic, old-man style of pub.

Not at all. I don't give a figs about what the council want to do with Princes st.

They never gained air superiority over us thanks to our radar. We could dispatch fighters to intercept them all the time. 

Without air superiority the converted barges they were going to use as transport would have been toast. The Navy (Still biggest in the world at that time) and RAF would have shredded anything that entered the channel. 

Even if they somehow got air superiority the Germans would have almost certainly failed. Just look at what D-Day entailed and then look at what the Germans had planned. D-Day was monumentally bigger, had a pipe line set up to supply fuel, and they still had supply line problems. The Germans would have run out of supplies and be forced to surrender pretty sharpish.

Do you know what it would entail to obtain a fully automatic Glock? 3000 USD or so each year for a class III licence. A transferable Glock 18 itself would run in the tens of thousands. The tooling and machinery required to make one well (illegally) would be even more, and anything not made well would more likely kill the person waving it around than anyone it was pointed at.

How many automatic weapons have been used in crimes? I'd be interested if you were aware of any statistics on that. 

I'm condoning it because I've taken the time to educate myself on it, since, like every human, I tend to be afraid of things I don't understand. I'm condoning it because your argument is basically from a position of ignorance and you're parroting this Joe Biden line about shotguns being fine but all else being instant death with no use. Why? Shotguns are only good for hunting certain things in certain circumstances. You want to hunt ethically and humanely you're not going to use a shotgun for everything. 

Like I said, it's not about ""need"". We live in a society where we want. We have disposable income and decide what we want to spend it on. I don't think anyone needs a PS4 but I won't piss myself when people go out in their millions and pick one up. Firearms are different in that they have the potential to cause great harm but _that doesn't make a difference_ if you're coming from the ""need"" angle since it's irrelevant. Not to mention that the vast majority of firearms owners are responsible and safe. When was the last time you heard of a mass shooting in Jersey? It's not a firearms issue. It's a societal issue; a mental health issue, a poverty issue; a criminal justice system issue.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"It's not really Brendan Rodgers making the decision with the money. It's the committee and I trust the committee. This Is Anfield had a great post about the members of the transfer committee: [http://www.thisisanfield.com/2013/06/liverpool-fc-transfer-committee-explained/](http://www.thisisanfield.com/2013/06/liverpool-fc-transfer-committee-explained/)

In a nutshell, the committee is comprised of (and I'm quoting from the aforementioned This Is Anfield article):

* **Brendan Rodgers**: ""Rodgers briefs his team on the positions to fill, the scouting team then provide recommendations and the committee collectively value the player accordingly, in terms of value and also wages.""

* **Dave Fallows**, Head of Recruitment: Fallows came from Man City along with chief scout Barry Hunter. Fallows' job is ""assigning scouts, filtering reports, preparing recommendations and presentations on the club’s targets, and compiling a database of scouted players.""

* **Michael Edwards**, Head of Performance and Analysis: According to the article, his role in the committee isn't exactly known but I suppose one can make some assumptions based on his title.

* **Ian Ayre**, Managing Director: It seems he's the main negotiator once a player is identified and a value is assessed. Surely there's a range regarding fees, wages, etc.

So between these four members, I feel pretty confident that the committee can spend 50 million pounds pretty wisely.

The potential 50m pounds from the possible sale of Suarez certainly sounds like a nice windfall but we are up against a lot of challenges:

* Other clubs will likely believe that with the departure of Suarez, LFC will be quick to buy a so-called ""replacement"" and possibly be willing to overpay. So perhaps other clubs will try and hold us hostsage and hold out for higher transfer fees.

* The lack of Champions League play (and no certainty that we'll make it this season w/o Suarez) will likely make some of the big-name players think twice about coming to Liverpool in spite of our potential and history and what not.

* So, w/o Champions League, there is the challenge of finding young, highly-talented players who will be willing to take a season or two to work their way into Champions League.

* In addition to finding talent that suits our playing style, Rodgers also requires players who have a strong character, that ""winning mentality,"" etc.

So, as many of us know, it's not a matter of ""oh, we have 50 million let's just grab such-and-such superstar."" It doesn't quite work like that, I'm afraid. So there are many challenges but I'm confident that the committee will make the right moves as they did in January. Granted, every player we want/need may not end up at Anfield but with each window that opens and closes, I think we'll get some quality each time and get to where we need to be.

If you have austerity and or you have other ancillary factors jobs growth can be affected as these issues are structural. It STILL means that Jobs aren't a finite resource in of themselves. Which is what you're arguing. 

The stimulus in the USA post 2008 and the effect of the Marshal Plan in Europe post-1948 proves that. Jobs were created by the stimulus which led to jobs being created by the action of the economy.

It wasn't as if there were only a finite number of jobs available and as people took them up they were displacing others who were doing those jobs. Capacity for employment varies and is elastic (we're not talking Price Elasticity here).

An ""immigrant"" taking up a job is not an ""immigrant"" displacing a job or vice versa. It's a fallacy. There isn't one job that moves between the two.

It just proves you don't really bother reading any social science, never mind economics and you don't do nuance.

true,brainburger,cnty-uk,London,"It does say 'British Citizen' on all our passports, including those from NI so you are right. I am just pontificating. It seems anomalous to me.

After the union of England and Scotland in 1707, there was a Kingdom of Great Britain, (including Wales which has never been a separate nation). The Kingdom of Ireland was at that time separate, but also ruled by the same monarchy. The native people of Ulster at that time were unambiguously Irish, though there were British ex-pats of course.

Then in 1801 the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was formed. which to my mind, conferred UK citizen  status on everyone involved. It seems only at the point of the Irish war of independence and the partition of Ireland in 1921 that the notion of the protestant residents of that part of Ulster being British came into being. I find myself wondering why a person espousing Britishness would argue they they have authority in a part of Ireland.

At the moment the government (particularly the Tory part) wants to foster a sense of resentment towards the disabled/unemployed/poor. In the way that populist politicians have done for years they single out a minority in society and turn the rest of society against them. By doing this they can secure a mandate to persecute them. It's been done all over, and it's being done now.

The Daily Mail likes to run stories about how bad benefit claimants are and reinforce stereotypes about it. That annoys me and I don't like it.

On the other hand the hard left and the far left are opposed to austerity and cuts. They seize any story or rumour about benefit claimants being victimised by inept or sadistic staff at job centres and cut away at any of the surrounding information and reduce it to a ridiculous sentence - the blog you have linked does that.

Reducing what may very well be a sad tale of how bad the DWP staff are into a single sentence removes any credibility and any ring of truth. 

The end result is very divisive. People cherry pick what information they read to meet their own preconceptions. So someone who thinks ""they're all scum"" will simply ignore the blog you've linked. People from the hard left will take it on board and see it as the absolute essence of the truth. 

However reasonable people will read it and think that it simply cannot be true - because it's so unbelievable..... and who will they believe? The government, and think it's all fine and nothing is wrong.

One final thing... I've seen this throughout my life. People want a little victory, they don't want to ""have lost"". So when they fuck up and make a mess of things they tell a slightly modified story to make it look as if they were cheated. I suspect that's an aspect of many of these stories.

Additionally when you think about it, if someone kills themselves because of one thing - could you not also put it that everything else was wrong (or felt wrong) in their life and this was the final thing that triggered it?

For example if someone kills themselves because their 'boyfriend left them' then wouldn't it be reasonable to say that perhaps other aspects of life had made them place undue value on the relationship to this point? 

I certainly could understand though a schoolboy hanging himself rather than face the daily physical and mental bullying he endured at school. You could argue that's a single cause. However I wouldn't want to claim I could fully understand it without a great deal of time spent looking into the boys life and circumstances - and even then I'm of course not an expert.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"While this is good news - yet another cobweb from the Bates era dusted away, as he seemed to have a vendetta against BBC Radio Leeds - I honestly don't like BBC Radio Leeds' coverage of Leeds United. Or didn't like it when they were able to fully cover the Whites, I should say. The quality of Yorkshire Radio these past few seasons (dodgy broadcasting facilities in places like Exeter's ground aside) has been far above the old BBC Radio Leeds coverage.

However, I ought to say that I am slightly biased because I live around 100 miles away from Leeds and get a decent reception on the old DAB radio, while there was only one spot in my house I could hear Radio Leeds out of with some semblance of clarity. Even worse was on the drive back home from a game: I'll almost always have a decent reception with Yorkshire Radio on the ride home (by the time I lose it in the hills, coverage has long finished), but Radio Leeds was always unintelligible for me before Adam and Eddie were done talking.

Anyway, location bias aside, here are the qualms I had regarding the quality of BBC Radio Leeds coverage. The main one is that they didn't spend enough time on the game. I think (but could not say for sure) that Yorkshire Radio spend more time covering it than Radio Leeds did, because Leeds United is Yorkshire Radio's main focus. Yet this was not their only problem - even bigger than that was the fact that half the time they **didn't even concentrate on the game while it was being played.** That used to annoy me to no end.

When I say all this, I am specifically referring to a feature they had where you could text in a message and they would read it out. While the game was playing. I still remember how annoying it was in the 07/08 game we lost away to Huddersfield: 'Janice from Leeds says, ""Come on the Whites!"" Mark from Halifax says, ""Fifteen points, who gives a duck? We're Leeds and we're going up!"" Andy from York says, ""We just need a goal now and that will do it."" Oh, wait a minute, the referee has just shown Douglas a red card! He's off - Leeds are down to ten men.'

Admittedly, if they just scrapped that feature then my biggest gripe wouldn't have existed, but it marginalised Eddie Gray (their broadcasting team of Adam Pope and Eddie Gray was well ahead of the rival Yorkshire Radio team at the time, Michael Weadock and Peter Lorimer/Norman Hunter), until after the game. That said, Thom and Eddie are the definitive duo for me now - I don't see how Radio Leeds can compete with that.

I suppose that the biggest problem people have is the amount of money Yorkshire Radio loses every year, but my theory is that - especially while Bates has been in charge - Yorkshire Radio has been a vehicle to write off losses and help keep LUFC's books looking relatively healthy. If Yorkshire Radio didn't exist, the losses would have probably been incurred by the Centenary Pavilion or Billy's Bar. It certainly is suspicious how all the staff members seem to be paid in expenses instead of a fixed salary. Of course, this might change with the new owners in charge.

Anyway, this ends the longest and most self-interested post you'll probably see from me. I hope that BBC Radio Leeds can improve their coverage from last time, but I hope that Yorkshire Radio keep going because I'll be listening to them for sure.",0,1373728046,null,0,false,0,cb1u9sj,t3_1i5e4v,t1_cb1u9sj,t3_1i5e4v,null,1430481834,3,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,3

However, the folks from Spain and Italy and Australia and wherever it's warmer are still wearing thicker coats and sweaters, because they're cold. It gets a little dampish here, so in the winter it feels colder than it is and the wind is a little cutting. 

If you're from a warm place, bring a warmer coat and expect to need sweaters (""jumpers"") for longer. It's really pretty mild here though, aside from how shitty the wind can get sometimes, but you might want to just have something wind and waterproof. My advice is don't bring an umbrella, they're ridiculous to use in the wind, and it hardly rains here; it's more like frustrating mist.

&gt;The Daily Mail has a long history of anti-Irish abuse but editor-in-chief Paul Dacre has ordered Ireland on Sunday's English editor Ted Verity - a former Daily Mail royal reporter - to recruit a team for the planned launch in two months time. Dacre was a leading executive at Associated during the IRA's Nineties bombing campaign when the Mail's leading writers called for Irish people to be banned from UK sporting events and fined for IRA disruption to public transport.

&gt;The paper's failure to discriminate between right-thinking Irish people who opposed the IRA surprised few, as readers had become used to its trenchant attacks on everything from immigration to its hatred for the European Union.

&gt;Its anti-Irish tone has been unrelenting, whether it has been negative stories about the drinking exploits of the Irish football team or the State funerals of Ireland's founders. In 2001,the Daily Mail criticised the State funerals for Kevin Barry and his comrades. The paper labelled Ireland's national heros as murderers and accused them of killing unarmed British soldiers. Ireland on Sunday's sister paper the Evening Standard - which Dacre once edited - also regularly ran cartoons featuring Irish people with grotesque and simple features.

&gt;London's current mayor Ken Livingstone was so appalled that he boycotted the paper because of what he believed to be it's anti-Irish bias.

On arrival at Kings Cross Train Station, head to platform 9 3/4. Its located between platform 9 and 10 (obviously), just look for the school kids walking into a brick pillar. 

Take the train (theres only one a day, and its a steam train! Choo Choo) and it will head north, probably. Loch Ness is the 81st stop and will take 19 hours. No food, drink, sleeping or sitting is allowed on the train.

The monster usually heads to the north shore around 7pm. There will be LOTS of swimmers and divers. For the full effect you will need to bring your own breathing apparatus and wet  suit. Expect to be in the water for 3-4 hours. You can camp in the woods, but bring a tent! Tents are legal to be used in Britain, but illegal to buy (I know! Madness) so you'll have to bring all the gear from wherever you are coming from. 

Thats about it. Oh, the Royal Family. They are a virtual construct used to lure in tourists, they dont exist in a physical form. You may contact the Latvian Embassy (based in St Albans) for a pass. This entitles you to one (1) visit to Madame Tussauds where the original hologram models are stored. Just ask on arrival. If there is a queue, dont worry about it, you got the pass from the embassy - just go up to the front and demand to be let in. If you encounter resistance from security or the peope queuing - just ignore it - its part of an elaborate ritual we do called Queuejumping. You are entitled to jump any queue with the appropriate pass. Do not let anyone stop you, and dont be afraid to throw a few punches. If the ""police"" turn up and are wearing Blue or Black, they are not the real police. British police only wear Green Uniforms. All others are imposters.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; No, but the law shouldn't waste any time on you if you choose to be an idiot.

I'm not sure what you're talking about?  You seem to have anthropomorphised the law.  The law has no time to waste, it's not a person.  The enforcers of the law would not have to waste time, I'm specifically asking for them to spend no time at all on me (well, a hypothetical me, I don't even ride a bike): so we're in 100% agreement.

&gt; But I can't see why anyone should have to give a toss if you care so little in the first place. 

What exactly is it you think I'd want from anyone if I'd smeared my brains across the road, let alone the law?  I certainly wouldn't be asking anyone to give a toss.  What I am asking for is the absence of something from the law -- interference.

The point is that should I wish to be wreckless with my own property (if I own one thing for certain, then it's my body), then I should be able to.  Once I am not able to do so, then my body is not my property; it's the state's property and there are a set of conditions for its use.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"When I read it the obvious inference was the governments welfare cuts are driving those dependant on welfare to suicide, From the article: 

&gt; *""It is thought the numbers of deaths has sharply increased since the Coalition government’s severe cuts to social security benefits""*

I don't doubt that the number of deaths has increased - but there are almost certainly multiple explanations, not all of them bad ...

* Firstly changes to who qualifies for incapcity benefit has made it more stringent - as a result those that recieve it are more likely to be at the severe end of the incapacity spectrum. Many causes of incapacity can and will ultimately claim the lives of those people (for example cancers) so a higher death rate could be explained away as a byproduct of demographic changes to incapacity claimaints.

* Suicide specifically is more likely to occur in those in a more advanced state of illness - so a higher rate would naturally be expected if (as I suggested above) stricter criteria has shifted incapacity claimaints towards the more serious end of the spectrum.

* Suicide is an incredibly complex and almost always multifactoral human behaviour.

true,Mr_Rivers,null,null,"Yes, let's be skeptical, let's also not downplay the role not having ANY MONEY, which means no food, no heating, no clothes, no bills paid, no kind of any self-improvement plays on suicide.

I get ESA, I had to appeal heavily to get it, even though I have 2 signed letters from consultants, a signed letter from a therapist, 2 chronic conditions which I am on a host of medications for and was put on anti-depressants for being heavily depressed.

Now, remove the benefits that I and my parents had to fight tooth and nail for. I am left with no food, no computer (which is a massive morale booster, not to mention the best tool for self-improvement), no way to improve myself (I had spent the same year I was appealing going to college) because I wouldn't be able to afford the bus, the meals I needed when I was there, or the tuition fees which were a part of it. 

I would have given up. You feel like the system has given up on you, the last people that can help you have thrown you under a bus, and that without any money, and the fact the government won't even recognize your need for help, you really have no hope of either improving your lot, or simply existing in relative comfort.

If my benefits had stopped, there is a fair chance I would have contemplated suicide. There are other factors there, yes, but you should always feel you have the government to fall back on when you are most in need. They pulled the rug out from some of the most needy people; to try and downplay this as something else is not fair.

People say it's only money, and that money isn't everything. Speaking as someone who doesn't have health, wealth or happiness, when the only thing you can truly rely on is the 'cripple check' (the name I used to call it)  coming on time.

No he is not. Not at all. Ibe is stronger and more direct, but Sterling's ball control and skill are far superiors to Ibe's. I'd say Sterling has a better footballing brain as well, he is a better passer and makes better runs. Sterling could be genuinely world class if he keeps on progressing the way he is.

Covenants like this have been thoroughly thrown out by the courts. 

They were popular amongst developers of housing estates c 1960's to enforce conformity in outside decorating, as it was thought to be untidy to have terraces and adjacent semi-detached houses painted in different colours. This was thrown out by the courts.

The Milton Keynes Development Corporation sold land to developers on the condition that they enforced certain covenants on buyers of the properties. Building the city from the ground up, every home was provided with cable TV and one of the covenants was that no home should be able to erect a TV aerial or satellite dish. Unfortunately MK's cable was shitty quality cable by today's standards, and didn't carry Sky exclusive channels, so now the covenants have been broken by 80% of the population (and this cannot legally be challenged). 

So whilst covenants do still have some applications, you're overstating their value and validity if you think it could apply to preventing people from selling their own homes for a profit.

Even in the case of shared-ownership properties whereby the owner is only selling a 50% share of the property (the housing association retaining the other 50%), it has not been possible AFAIK to prevent owners from charging ridiculous fees of £10,000+ (to keep the extra profits for themselves and to deprive the housing association of them) for transfer of the key. So this is one way that owners might evade your proposed restrictions.
