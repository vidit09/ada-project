Rodgers is a very good manager and I don't think he would play Sakho at LB if Enrique were fit, there is just no way. He thought that even with 4 CB's we would still win the game against Southampton which is a legitimate assumption. Our midfield just decided to not show up and that is why we lost. 

And going back to your CF: Rodgers pointed out several times that our attacking players are able to play in several positions. Aspas played the majority of last season as a CF so he would be the logical replacement. Moses, according to Rodgers, can also play at CF. So risking Sturridge, still our best CF, against Manchester United, the biggest game in the league, makes sense. And he won it for us.

I've offered alternatives for those on loan so that it reflects both our possible squad if loans were recalled, but also if that wasn't possible in time. In the case of having Lamah instead of Ki, I would move Pozuelo into the middle, put de Guzmán further back and have Lamah on the wing.

No doubt all of us would really have wanted this win, and to stay top of the table, but I think this loss may have positives. Firstly, we haven't really played attractive possession based football since the game against Stoke. Arguably, its hard to do so against Manchester united and Swansea, but nonetheless, at least now its blindingly obvious.

So we dropped points early on in the season, disappointing but rather now than later and rather now so that Rodgers can see the mistakes he made (as well as certain players not performing) and learn from them rather than take the gamble again in the future.

Lastly, this was a much needed dose of reality for us the fans, and probably some of the players. We need to realize that we were leading the table after 4 games and that was sure as hell not a reason to be predicting title challenges while overlooking bad performances.

[They don't really](http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/scottish-independence-polls-blow-for-snp-1-3099478).

Infact, I see a lot of *""depends which polls you look at""* and *""the yes campaign are gaining momentum""* comments on Reddit. But, if you go back and [look at the polls](http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/scottish-independence) they haven't ever really shown that bar one or two outliers.

Most polls seem to sit around 30-35% YES, 50-55% NO. This is particularly true of polls with a simple yes/no answer to independence. Polls that include devo max tend to favour that as the outcome at the expense of the No vote. Out of the 20-30 odd major polls, only a handful have shown a difference of less than -5 points... so even on a good day as things **currently** stand the yes campaign need to bring about a considerable swing.

I would agree that it's certainly not outside the realms of possibility that events could swing the campaign in favour of the yes vote... however IF the current trajectory continues then it will probably end up being a 50-60% majority NO vote. 

Here is another thought to... if it ends up being a single percentage point majority (which is perhaps one of the more likely outcomes for a yes vote) that might be sufficient for a second referrendum to decide between pressing ahead with independence or going for devo max. Remember, a yes vote doesn't remove Scotland from the UK... what it does is give the SNP the democratic mandate to seek a settlement with the UK government in westminster to exit the union. Precisely what the terms and timetable of that settlement are will be down to the politicians involved - mostly on the westminster side since it will be down to them to legislate to facilitate Scotlands exit from the union. 

It would theoretically be possible for the SNP to unilaterally remove Scotland from the union using the yes vote as a democratic mandate. But that would be a pretty disasterous 'last ditch' move for all involved, as it would crush buisness and consumer confidence probably plunging both nations into another recession. Furthermore, it would leave huge diplomatic issues undecided - ranging from allocation of the radio spectrum all the way up to the distribution of oil and even the precise borders of this new nation. Given that Scotland is considerably less populous than the UK, and our shared financial and political hub is located in England (at Westminster), unilaterally leaving would be akin to running away from your parents house as a teenager (i.e. achieving full independence, but with nothing but the clothes on your back).... so in many ways the Scots will be at the mercy of the Westminster gov. when it comes to a timetable for exit.",0,1379803991,null,0,1379804515,0,cccv7q6,t3_1mud29,t1_cccv7q6,t1_cccunts,null,1429386268,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; A much better question would be what is going to happen to the SNP and Salmond in particular if/when the outcome of the vote is no?

Probably nothing in the short term - in the slightly longer term, Salmond is 58 (so will probably retire in the next decade) and the next set of Scottish parliamentary elections are in 2016 (having said that, Scottish Labour are not putting up a particularly effective opposition at the moment - so I wouldn't say a no vote then SNP win was out of the question).


&gt; Are we going to see decades of never-endums like in Quebec.

It's a cute slogan, but are you suggesting that if the Conservatives win an election then Labour should pack up their bags and not contest the next election? Parties have policies - if people vote a party into power, it's reasonable to expect them to follow through.


&gt; Will we see an aggressive element of Scots nationalism like we saw in Northern Ireland?

No.

&gt; Will the seperatists even accept the outcome of the referrendum?

Yes.

&gt; At any rate, even if the outcome is a yes vote it seems like it will be by such an incredibly narrow margin that it will essentially be 51% of the nation pulling 49% in a direction they don't want to go in. Scotland will basically be in the position Belgium is in, where it became independent and a massive swathe of the population have basically regretted it ever since.

Whoever wins will proclaim themselves to have ""a mandate"" - that's a certainty. But I think it's worth remembering that in most UK general elections, the winner normally gets around 30% of the electorate. That seems to be sufficient.

Programmers are proven to have a different way of thinking, due to conditional type programming. If, Then, Else conditional logic enables a progmatic approach to life. Learning ""a"" language is not good, learning programming could be a great carrier choice.

I think you say ""present-day"" with the idea business is going away, unless theirs a communist uprising im missing that its more hardcore than China's where business is prospering - i am doubtful for of the insinuation.

Business is _the_ most common culture today within the UK, practiced 9am to 5pm by majority of citizens five days a week.

You don't need to run a business to apply business skills as its education it is far from specific and helps with everyday household financial requirements in addition to assisting to prosper within an structure of an organisation. Not mentioning enabling the opportunity to take said skills and become an employer rather than an employee.

Take our legal system and ""Cival Law"" based on Contracts, the origin of businessmen of the sea to sort out their disputes. What class teaches contracts, other than business?

Whilst, classical music can be applied. Well, when listening to Classical FM. You talk about legacy programming languages, which can be compared to legacy classical music - dated and past its time. Way to ""specific"" as you mention.

I think most people would prefer to ready their children for the real world of working life, with summer holidays to do things for enjoyment like every generation before them. No one on their deathbed wishes they spent more time at work, they do though wish they were able to live a good life and leave a legacy for their loved ones.

On that note very little of the current generation in retirement are wishing they knew more about classical music, A lot of people look back and wish they used the time they had to do things for enjoyment.

Exposed and Forced are two difference things, i would not force classical music on anyone - as i would not programming or business skills. That is up to the children if they have a path they wish to follow with guidance from their parents of which type of school they should attend.

With Allen or Henderson playing alongside Lucas, or even each other in the middle, there would be more energy. You also keep the creativity and vision that Gerrard brings to the table, but when he lets people go or can't run back then there is cover behind him.Also when he does bring out the lung busting run which does make an appearance every now and then he's doing it from higher up the pitch.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;So if local crops fail, local people starve?  Here in the UK we'll only be eating spuds and locally grown crops in the winter?

Permaculture offers similar or higher yields than industrial monoculture, it also doesn't deplete the environment and isn't dependent on large amounts of nitrogen fertiliser.  There are also many technological improvements we've made since medieval times (and will continue to make), as well as many crops we've discovered since which are amenable to our climate - not to mention our climate is changing and will continue to change.  But yes, more people will need to grow their own and their neighbours' food.  It's worth bearing in mind that the ""half way round the world"" Caesar salad is going to go the way of the dodo whatever you feel.  Such things were always unsustainable and will become unaffordable to all but the very wealthy - so, you have to ask yourself if you think the destruction of the planet is worth it just so a very small fraction of people can continue to have such luxuries.  Even if you do, the prices they will pay will continue to ramp and thankfully the freight aircraft which bring them will become fewer and fewer, so you might as well plan for an old age, or a future if you don't make it, where your children eat local produce again.

&gt;I think that the more you think about whatever radical ideology you hold, the more it'll make less sense and seem more unworkable.

This isn't even about my ideology - either we make some radical changes or the planet will force us to. I have many ideas about what I would like to see, but if you try to continue life as always, be prepared for it all to go tits up anyway sooner than you might find comfortable because of all the exponentials, and with far less choice than a planned path will offer you.  There's this thing called overshoot and die off which is a fairly cast iron law, and it's coming to a supermarket/petrol station/manufacturing plant/office/home near you sooner than you think.

&gt;Do you want us to get rid of the police, fire services, NHS?

If we're moving away from the inevitability of economic and environmental decline and talking about my ideology now, then no, I want to see all those things continue, but in a radically different form. All would be mutually run, by their workers and the communities they serve, and interconnected in syndicates geographically and with other mutuals and worker-self-directed enterprises with which they are linked in their sectors.  Policing is somewhat the odd one out here, as though I foresee a need for community self-defence teams to tackle crimes of passion and the few persistently or seriously anti-social/mentally unwell individuals who are violent/dangerous, under a genuine system of anarchism one could expect to see acquisitive crime drop off a cliff since inequality would be massively reduced and the artificial scarcities created by it, and by the State would be gone.

&gt;Cancer needs to be cured, malaria eradicated, internet speeds increased, life spans increased, technology advanced, interworld communication and mars colonisation.. Do you agree that humanity needs these things?

They are all noble goals and humanity collectively would have much more time and freedom to pursue them.  People do these things currently for profit or for love/interest.  The first inducement would be gone, but the second would be stronger than ever and there would be far far more people in the game and with access to the information and the tools to make them a reality.

&gt;Look around you mate, everything you have people made because they were paid to make them. Democracy and capitalism give people inspiration to create and advance us as a species, it's undeniable!

Gerrard needs to be taken out of the anchoring two.

This solves the problematic right wing area. Henderson/Lucas/Allen vie for the two anchor positions. It also means that Gerrard doesn't have to tire himself out trying to do everything.

Of course before starting typing I should have realised that equivalent data from 35 years ago is not so easy to find... Maybe I'll come back with that later, or not.

In the meantime I did find [this - Regional Gross Disposable
Household Income (GDHI)

I'd pick Linux &gt; Windows &gt; Mac

Nobody mentioned Fluxbox, so whats the issue? Isn't that part of the beauty of Linux/POSIX that you can strap whatever you want on?

&gt;Will it snap in to AD and be managed via a snap-in to the usual interface? Right then, I don't care about it. I'm too busy dealing with trouble tickets. And I say that as an AIX admin.

It can't snap onto AD because MS try hard to stop it doing that, if they used open protocols, or published their protocols, sure it would.

I probably own a few thousand Bowie tracks and my favourites always change, but [all the madmen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlVbLgxokEo) is my current favourite. His voice makes my legs quiver sometimes. Although I don't really find him attractive (he's really short and I like younger men), I'd still marry the fuck out of him, just to wake up every morning to a bona fide FUCKING GENIUS. 

I had to stop myself from crying three times when I saw his exhibition at the V&amp;A. Strong feelings bro. 

Oh god, Bowie. Cannot count the ways in which I love thee. Although some of your acting performances leave an awful lot to be desired.

&gt;EDIT NOTE: the category examples are based on current mobile configurations and broad indications from ISPs

They keep using the filters that TalkTalk provides, an optional service to customers worried about their kids going on Facebook, as an example of what will be mandated by the government.

I had parental controls activated on my phone for several months as GiffGaff's mechanism to turn it off was broken. These are now required (I believe) by default on all phone subscriptions, so they're a good indicator of what any general broadband filter might look like. I never had a problem accessing Facebook, Twitter, popular forums like Neogaf, or even Reddit. I don't go out of my way to look at porn but I don't shy away from other 'controversial' material, and I never encountered a blocked page.

But you know what, this is actually more worrying. If this filter is going to be a massive inconvenience, we have nothing to fear. It won't last a week if the average Tory voter can't access the pages and services they use even 5% of the time.

And yes most of us have lashed something like that together at one time or another.  It's kind of like programmers writing their own compiler.  It still doesn't work as well as AD's management interface does.

No actually that's complete bullshit because the EU forced Microsoft to provide the specs for the AD protocols to the SAMBA team, hence Samba 4.  However it has no interpretive layer so you can't feed it an AD policy or fully manage it from the console; but bits of it DO and can be.

The Daleks and the Time Lords were engaged in The Last Great Time War.

The whole war is ""time locked"" so that no one can visit it. We never see the war, we just hear bits and pieces about it whenever he feels especially guilty.

A lot of this is in the End of Time series' (right before David Tennant regenerated).

I still think Martinez is probably a better tactician, but Rogers has really gained my trust and I'm happy we got him. One thing I didn't account for when I wanted Martinez was how he would perform in the transfer market after going from a shoe string budget at Wigan, to actually having cash to spend. That's one place where Brendan has done well, bringing in players like Coutinho and Sturridge at prices that look like absolute bargains now. It's too early to completely judge Martinez's transfer dealings this summer, but it looks like he's struggled buying players for value (not counting the players he loaned). James McCarthy was definitely over priced and Aroune Kone at 31 is not a great signing for a team looking to move forward. 

Okay so I'm kind of rambling now but I just wanted to give Brendan some kudos. It also seems like he has improved massively his attitude and demeanor as being manager of Liverpool Football Club. Last season he sounded a bit out of his depth and unsure of himself.

They look for simple answers to complex situations. The world is way too complex for singular answers.

There may well be a small minority of Muslims in this country that would like to impose Sharia Law, i am going to bet that there is probably a small minority of Christians that would like us to live by their doctrine as well. We have 1000 years of legal precedent and a separation of church and state enshrined in law, so every time you throw the ""sharia law"" argument about you show hoe ill-informed you are and why you should not be taken seriously.

While the Angels and the Vashta we can relate to from our childhood or current small phobia, it can be dealt with. Who hasn't been home alone at one point and heard something next to you, or heard a sound from a room that's empty? Once that spark of fear is lit, you're hiding in your room reading something funny or listening to music.

Rich is someone who has a choice in most manners and probably owns their own home, and several others.

e.g. 

""I'd like to buy that car, here's a spare £100K I have lying around.""

""I want that house there.""

Now consider that ""that house there"" in the UK is a minimum £500K+ in most areas I've looked at outside of London. That's about 10x the £60K wage. This is considered ""unaffordable"". 


Most engineers are able to earn around £50K to £60 in the R&amp;D sector and up to double that in the financial sector (London). Engineering is not a ""rich"" profession. Banking, doctor, lawyer is. They get a substantial amount more than £60K.

I still think Mata needs to be in there, he is pretty much gelled with the team to be left out. 

I read a very similar and interesting article about JM the other day, as per that they say JM builds a team which is not very mobile or fluid as our players are. He likes to build a strategy around a team which has 2 holding/strong players in defence and midfield who keep the defence line and midfield line in their position instead of shifting it far back or far ahead. And since we don't have that many players to do so, its taking time to adjust to it. 

But it looks like precisely the reason why Ivanovic would be passing the ball forward instead of crossing it far too ahead. He is one of those key players in his strategy to keep a static and strong formation. The AM and strikers would be the only ones who would be moving ahead for an easy goal instead of long shots. 

But hey, thats my interpretation of what I read and what I am seeing now, I might be wrong. 

Spurs are doing good but their midfield plays in a very confused manner, the lack of a substantial figure who could command the line is missing. I am guessing its because of Bale gone and Lennon missing. Don't get me wrong their midfield is very talented now but nobody is there to hold them well.

&gt; Having a couple of illiterate kids who dropped English isn't beneficial to anyone.

The current system seems to produce illiterates. Another thing it produces is highly literate robots who, despite having great linguistic technik are absent any intelligence whatsoever (again the Eton gits come to mind). 

If you dedicated your life to learning music, you would quickly discover that it is essential to have a decent command of language in order to communicate with others, which is what the arts are about. Via the need to communicate you might discover an interest in literature and realise that broadening one's understanding of the world would make you a better artist. This might even lead you to have an interest in biology or something which, when you come to it via a natural process of discovery, would be far more compelling than some dry bollocks being forced on you by a frustrated teacher with an inadequate understanding of the subject.  

EDIT: It's also important to note that there are people who struggle with literacy and could manage to get through life without being metaphorically punched in the face every time the issue of reading and writing comes up. Instead of creating an environment in which certain holy cows must be worshipped in order to be recognised as a worthy participant in society, intelligent people would make space for every proclivity to be expressed.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; My point was that it will be much easier for the separatists to compromise on devolution but not get independence than it will be for those Scots who identify as UK citizens to be told that is no longer going to be the case.

I don't see why - both have something they believe is the best outcome, but the vote is simply yes/no.

&gt; Ultimately for the separatists losing means pushing on with the lives they already have -the status quo. For the NO camp compromise will mean potentially losing their desired nationality, their ability to move freely in the EU (if Scotland can't quickly rejoin), it might mean losing their jobs and livelihood if London registered businesses start to pull out etc. Then what about Scots in the British army/navy and RAF. Those veterans of heavy fighting in the middle east might not want to be transferred to a coast guard sized Scottish 'self defence' force... These are just a few examples.

Let's take each one in turn:

* Voting no may unfortunately mean losing freedom of movement. The UK will probably have an in/out referendum on EU membership in 2016; if you vote yes in 2014 then that referendum is moot, if you vote no in 2014 then the result will largely be determined by the rest of the UK. Every single Scottish voter could vote yes to stay in the EU yet still find themselves outside of it.

* Saying ""quickly rejoin"" implies that Scotland would leave the EU? I don't believe anyone has proposed that. Scotland would remain in the UK until both the UK secession and EU accession processes were defined, and transition from one to the other on the same day. At no point would it be outside the EU.

* Some businesses may well decide to move out of an independent Scotland; on the other hand, some may well decide to move in. This same point was raised repeatedly before devolution itself - the CBI were also [against that](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/news/09/0908/scotland.shtml) (there's an interesting analysis of CBI Scotland membership [here](http://calumcashley.blogspot.co.uk/2011/01/cbi-scotland-who-does-it-speak-for.html)). London seems to have an inevitable pull on people and jobs at present - independence would not solve that problem for the rest of the UK, but it seems quite likely that Scots that currently feel they ""have to"" leave for work may actually decide that independence brings opportunity.

* The UK armed forces would be divided between Scotland and rUK. It seems quite likely that some Scots currently employed by the UK armed forces would not want to join the Scottish equivalent - then again, some would. I'm sure you can find an anecdote about someone who'd think being in the Scottish armed forces was somehow a ""lesser"" role, then again you can probably find someone wondering why he wound up in the middle of a desert on Tony Blair's say-so.

I think your examples are coloured by your own perception that independence would be divisive. You seem to believe that both yes or no votes would lead to that outcome - I don't think that's the case. Irish independence was undeniably a bitter process, but it was rooted in some very painful history.

While this is true, it only takes one slip up and you're behind, which is a difficult position to get out of.

I think Hughton's tactics are great, but need a little tweaking. Firstly, we should not be going into every game (home or away) just with the objective of not letting them score. We probably could have got a point from Villa if Hughton had been a bit more willing to throw players forward. It worked for last season as the aim was to stay up, but we should be in this league to compete. Secondly, he is stubborn and does not seem to like changes. Snodgrass was having an absolutely awful game yesterday, yet he played the full ninety minutes. Chris should be more harsh on under performing players. Lastly, I feel that when he does make changes they are not the right ones. Taking Redmond off and not bringing a creative player on cost us yesterday.

However, I feel he has built a fantastic, top half potential team at Norwich and I would be devastated if he were to lose his job. The wins against Manchester United and Arsenal were won with defensive football. Once a few things are changed I have no doubt we'll be unstoppable this year.

Basically we look absurdly good when we are in control and attacking. When all four of our strikers are involved in play. The second we try to play a bit deeper our two man midfield is completely overrun and we basically lose four players. 

It has happened in every second half so far and I can not for the life of me understand why Brendan has not done something about this yet. We are more or less playing a 4-2-4 formation, and neither of the attacking players will drop into the middle to help Gerrard and Lucas. We are trying to play a passing buildup, but have no one to pass to until we get the ball deep into the opposition half.

Yesterday this problem was obviously going to show even more considering we had no fullbacks to assist the midfield. Meaning that Stevie and Lucas was completely isolated between two almost flat fours in either end of the pitch. Why we didn't drop Hendo down into midfield and played a 4-3-3 is really beyond me. 

Also Aspas does not work behind the striker. He needs to play up front or on the wing where he can actually use his strengths; challenging players one on one.

Yes.

I have found that Twitter can get some great results.

Recently I tweeted a local PCB (printed circuit board, electronics stuff) manufacturer asking them to price match another PCB manufacturer.

I ended up with BOTH PCB manufacturers courting me for their business, favouriting my tweets, and subscribing to my Twitter feed (I send about 1 tweet every couple months!).

Finally, I gave one of them my business and I got a great deal.

Same with my ISP (TalkTalk). I send my network complaint via Twitter and I get prompt and great service.

EDIT: I'd just like to add ...

The PCB company who got my business was a local one, in England. I really did want to give them my business but their prices were a bit too high for me to make the decision. They were trying to negotiate via Twitter which was going to look really bad for them because my counter-arguments would have simply sent their potential customers to the (cheaper) competition.

In the end, I contacted them via email and told them exactly why I **wasn't** going to use their service. They quoted me a price that was about 10% more than the competition and I could live with that. (we've talking the difference between about  £150 and £170)

PCB manufacturing is fairly cutthroat so they will actively pursue customers. ",0,1379849996,null,0,1379887355,0,ccd4oir,t3_1mw0wl,t1_ccd4oir,t1_ccd4ivx,null,1429381780,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

I hate to say it but physically he is showing signs that maybe we need to do with him what ferguson done with Giggs. And that's start dropping him more and more for lesser games(no offence to a team that's just deservedly beat us) so he can be influential in the bigger games.

Did we really need Gerrard yesterday? We could have started Hendo and Lucas in the center. Played Alberto in the hole, Aspas right, Moses left, and Sturridge up top. Have the returning Allen on the bench or even reward one of the two U21s that done so well against Sunderland.

The reason this works well with Brazil  is that the two full-backs are Marcelo and Dani Alves, who can run the whole wing and provide support for the lack of width in the offense, allowing Neymar to move to the center. 

Defensively, Paulinho/Luis Gustavo are very physical players who work as destroyers. I think this would work well with Rami, but as good as Lamps is defensively, I don't think he has the pace to cover that much ground and still fill for the defensive holes left by the full-backs when they are ahead.

I went to the CAB, they wrote to all my debtors (about 10), they helped me work out a reasonable budget, they basically dealt with everything, stopped the debt collectors phone calls, the lot.

I ended up paying token sums to the debt companies each month. At one point it was £1 per month each, so £10 in total.. It kept them quiet mostly.

I was panicking and stressed but CAB helped me get breathing space and work out what to do for the best. They explained bankruptcy and voluntary agreements and would have helped me get that done had I chosen to go that route.

I decided to avoid bankruptcy (though now I am not sure it was the best choice) and am still making token payments. The debt companies are now offering reduced payment for final settlement. If I could come up with about £6k I could clear the lot. I just need to get £6k together.

In short, £6k is not a big enough debt to panic over, to leave the country or to go bankrupt over. Get to CAB or another debt advice agency. Come clean with them, they will help you.

If you are getting multiple calls from people you owe money, don't speak to them. Tell them it is with CAB. Some will still be arsey, but YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEAK TO THEM.

It's not that he strikes hollywood balls with his feet.
Yesterday we had (compartively to Enrique and especially Johnson) two very immoveable fullbacks and against the swans our back was astonished by the pressure, at the end there wasn't any movement in the back. He decided, to try it wide instead of pass the ball in a risky way. I take that hundred times over risking goals directly. Apart from that, he stood his man again so fucking good yesterday. Shot-blocking as well as be quick on his feet [think about how he shielded [or 'jose-enriqued']that one ball out] and just be there when needed. I don't say, it couldn't be better, but I'm happy enough about his performances as that I want him to be overcritizised about something which he'll learn over the time and which isn't entirely his own fault.

But it is **far from certain** that Scotland would automatically join the EU or even be allowed to.

&gt; The UK armed forces would be divided between Scotland and rUK.... []... ""lesser role""

I think if you look into the current opinions of forces personnel it's less about jingoistic nationalism and more about simple career prospects. Imagine for example an AS90 artillery gunner... Now lets say an iScotland defense force has decided it won't use the AS90 system... after all, why would a small self-defense force want an expensive expeditionary artillery platform designed to stop the Russians advancing into Germany (especially considering most of the AS90 maintainance/training/ infrastructure is located in England and would have to be rebuilt north of the border) -- So there will be very little career prospects for a veteran AS90 artillery gunner in this new fabled Scottish army. It doesn't matter how much he loves Alex Salmond  -- its about where his life will be better, and for him the prospects for promotion, money and happiness will be in the British army. If you go and read the AARSEforums or other forces media you'll see that is basically the general consensus... most forces personnel seem to think the SNP plans are half-baked and under-ambitious, and that there will be few career prospects for veterans - especially those of platforms that will not be acquired by the Scots (which is most of the RAF and any army heavy-armour). 

This may come as a suprise - but soldiers actually **like** going to conflict zones and fighting. They don't join the army with dreams of polishing boots in a barrack block. For them the prospects of actually getting their hands dirty and **being** soldiers, rather than looking like soldiers will be in the British army. It is for that reason the British army still has a lot of Irish and commonwealth recruits who join specifically to see action.

&gt; Scottish independence is simply the logical conclusion of devolution.

My suspicion is that there won't be independence. Statements like yours are the sort of naive thoughts of younger adults - with very little to lose, and more interest in the philosophical aspects of independence. But I garuntee when you are in your 40s, with children to look after, a job to hold down and bills to pay that the thought of change on this scale will send a cold shiver down your spine. Sometimes risking stability isn't worth small rewards, and from the polls that seems to be the opinion of the majority in Scotland.

Never the less, were it to happen independence **will** inevitably be divisive, because it will create winners and losers on a big scale. There will be Scots who never forigve Salmond for destroying the lives they had made for themselves - and this may be particularly true if you end up with a likely situation where entire communities end up losing their industry due to the relocation of buisness. Ultimately that's what happened in the North of England due to industrial reform in the 1980s... and 30 years on they're no closer to forgiving or forgetting.

true,putmeinthezoo,river,River,"***Spoiler Warning for anyone not caught up through Season 7***

I still think it's the Tardis. The episode was about what you have faith in, not what you fear. 

The Doctor fears himself and what he has done in the past and what he has the potential to do. In AGMGTW, River tells him that he made everyone hate him. In Pandorica Opens, everyone hates him. In Let's Kill Hitler, the first image is of himself and he asks for someone he likes instead. In Amy's Choice, there's the conversation about self hatred with the Dream Lord. There are also several conversations between 9 and 10 and various characters - the Daleks in particular for both, and the genocide he committed as 10 in Runaway Bride. And of course now we know about Hurt's Doctor, who was denied the title of Doctor. There's no way he has faith in himself, so why would he be the image in the room, and in particular, the image of Hurt?

The Tardis, on the other hand always comes through to get him and his companions out of impossible situations, makes his new screwdrivers, and most importantly, takes him where he needs to be even when he wants to be somewhere else. Sexy said so herself in The Doctor's Wife. When it is destroyed in End of Time and sent back with Rose in End of the World, you can see how heartbroken he is to lose his one lifelong friend. Finally, there are the conversations with Amy and Clara about ""in the end the companions move on, but you and the Tardis are companions forever."" Plus, the cloister bell sounds when he opens the door. ",0,1379858023,null,0,false,0,ccd5u9x,t3_1mw1kv,t1_ccd5u9x,t3_1mw1kv,null,1429381227,15,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,15
true,RupertSacamano,lfc68,,"Think that's a biased point: I understand what you mean, but first of all, I'm convinced of that he's able to learn that. In my perception he doesn't seem that uncomfortable on the ball, even if his passing is behind others - there are goalkeepers, where you have to fear, if they even hit the ball. I'd put him somewhere in the middle, but with enough to potential to improve it and become a decent passer. ONe shouldn't forget, that he came from a club like Sunderland to Liverpool, at this point to fulfill Reina's footsteps. That he has/had his struggling with these expectations, was more or less apparent in the Stoke match, where he produced had a couple of failures in the first 60 minutes. But he grow from match to match, he seems to be securer week in, week out. That's why I'm confident, that he's also able to cope that passing issue.

On the other side, I just don't rate that problem as big as others do, what doesn't mean, I don't understand what they critizise. I could imagine, that my opinion is influenced by the general status of the whole team, that there are bigger worries we should care about and I'm just glad to have him between the posts, rescueing our arse more than once this season.

    Avoid simplistic explanations for suicide

Although a catalyst may appear to be obvious, suicide is never the result of a single factor or event and is likely to have several inter-related causes. Accounts which try to explain a suicide on the basis of a single incident, for example unrequited romantic feelings, should be challenged. Where relevant, news features could be used to provide more detailed analysis of the reasons behind the rise in suicides.



    Encourage public understanding of the complexity of suicide

People don’t decide to take their own life in response to a single event, however painful that event may be, and social conditions alone cannot explain suicide either. The reasons an individual takes their own life are manifold, and suicide should not be portrayed as the inevitable outcome of serious personal problems. Discussing the risk factors encourages a better understanding of suicide as part of a much wider issue and challenge for society.",0,1379861417,null,0,false,0,ccd6kut,t3_1mw21j,t1_ccd6kut,t3_1mw21j,null,1429380883,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

true,putmeinthezoo,river,River,"That was the point of the episode. The gambler had faith in luck. We don't know what he saw in his room, but probably something to do with money, so he fell back on his faith in luck. The girl had faith in her religion. Her fear of her father (shown in the room berating her for school failure) made her fall back on her religion. The nerdy guy feared girls, so he fell back on his fantasy/RPGs/books/etc after he saw a bunch of scantily clad girls laughing at him. 

When I first saw the episode, I figured he saw young Amelia in the room and that they went back into that room at the end. I thought he had fear of screwing her up like he did with Rose and Martha and Donna. 

But on rewatching, you can see the reflection of the Tardis in his eyes and hear the Tardis noises, so the Amy idea didn't make as much sense. I suppose it's possible he saw himself as his fear, and the Tardis is the faith he falls back on, but since they are intertwined both may have been in the room.

* [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10016013-harry-potter-and-the-methods-of-rationality) by **Eliezer Yudkowsky**    
While it is technically fanfiction, it is absolutely wonderful and well-written book. It's 'plot' is Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality is ""A work of alternate-universe Harry Potter fan-fiction wherein Petunia Evans has married an Oxford biochemistry professor and young genius Harry grows up fascinated by science and science fiction. When he finds out that he is a wizard, he tries to apply scientific principles to his study of magic, with sometimes surprising results.""    
I mean how can anyone not read that?

* [The Last Song](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6400090-the-last-song) by **Nicholas Sparks**    
Yes yes, I know. It's supposed to be teen girl nonsense but I read it anyway, I'm a sucker for stuff like this. The book is pretty average with a punk girl finding a nice guy and his parents opposing her.    
What is interesting is that somewhere near the end, the book turns from ok to good because of the main character's relationship with her father getting swished up because of an 'event'. It's a spoiler so I won't go into more details but suffice to say that it's worth a shot if you're lonely and sad.

* [The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2429135.The_Girl_with_the_Dragon_Tattoo) by **Stieg Larrson**    
I'll just say it was brilliant, fast paced and very very interesting. Definitely would recommend.

* [50 Shades of Grey](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818853-fifty-shades-of-grey) by **E.L James**    
I didn't enjoy it very much. I knew I was going to read something weird but if it had been well written, I would've enjoyed it. You know when someone publishes an article in the local newspaper and even though you know nothing about the topic, you still clearly feel that he's bullshitting? That's how I felt. It's almost as if the author had googled 'kinky sex' and listed the top 30 suggestions in the book. Would not recommend.

* [Perks of Being a Wallflower](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22628.The_Perks_of_Being_a_Wallflower?ac=1) by **Stephen Chobsky**    
Let me make one thing clear. Reddit hates the movie but I loved it, I'd watch it thrice if I had to. So I obviously picked up the book as soon as I saw it.    
The book is written as a collection of letters Charlie sends to us, the anonymous bro. I have to say I am not a fan of that format, it really took me a while to get accustomed to reading everything in third person. Other than that it's an awesome book that deals with issues that are usually teenage but in a very mature way. Would recommend.

*I am currently reading*

Nothing at the moment, will probably read Harry Potter again to satisfy my hard on for Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.

Have you actually bought a ticket with Ryanair? Go to the website and have a look. A lot of them are advertised as free online check-in. The ones that aren't do charge you for online check-in. It's included in the listed price so I don't have a problem with this.

No. With Ryanair it's a hidden charge. There's no mention of how much carrying luggage will cost until you've started the process and selected a flight. With BA it's explicitly listed as a completely different ticket.

They have driven my mother to tears and rage on several occasions. As someone who has been suicidal in the past, and has gone through ATOS claims systems for years, it doesn't come as a shock to me that claiming on ATOS benefits would drive someone already on the brink of suicide to actually do it.

The writting is straightforward and the prose is actually painfully basic (""*...said Harry softly*"", ""*...said Professor Snape loudly*"", ""*...said Ron airily*""). By the seventh book I was glad to see the back of it, and felt like I'd just flogged a dead horse simply to get closure. 

In and of itself I guess I'm greatful to the books, they encouraged me to read at an important age. But on the flipside the series ended up being contorted into a truly terrific beast of capitalism, and falsly elevated Rowling to the status of literary demigod.

If he had, say, 20 minutes instead of 5, maybe we wouldn't have had to score in stoppage time. It's not an easy call to change up a lineup that's playing so well but is unable to find the back of the net thinking that the goal will eventually come. I get that. I just feel that AVB is often a bit late in making his subs and that doesn't allow the subs to make an actual impact in the game.

[I stayed at this hostel](http://www.hostelbookers.com/hostels/england/liverpool/44314/) when I went last season with a mate. We had an entire room with a TV  for ourselves. The rooms and bathrooms were very clean, lots of friendly people and free breakfast, all for £10 a night per head.

Its very close to the stadium, cost about £6 for a taxi. We even walked back from the stadium without issues after the match because we couldn't get a taxi after the match.

The problem is, when players move to close down a player like townsend who will shoot it's only useful if the player can actually score, or makes the correct pass into space.

Yes, the shooting threat of Townsend will open up space, but what good is it if the end product is constantly a tame shot into the arms of the opposition keeper.

The reason I think Lennon could easily take his place back is because Lennon can provide crosses/passes from the byline which Soldado thrives on. We have players like Erikson and Paulino in the middle, who can create the space Lennon needs to get in behind defenders. With Lamella on the left who can also stretch defences in partnership with Lennon. Lennon also has the ability to swap sides and play on the left, as he often did with Bale at times, which will afford Lamella the chance to play on the right and takes shots as well.

The only problem I have with Lennon is that his crosses can often be as lacklustre as some of Townsend's shots. I'd be happier if Townsend was blasting the shots and hitting defenders because a loose ball could easily be turned in by Soldado.

And quite a few run-down bits, you can't deny it. 

Elsewhere Brighton and Barmouth both get votes from me. Brighton really is lively - the beach itself is totally overrated but the town is great. So much to do. Barmouth has a kind of decaying charm that I really like. North Norfolk is also a seaside area with great scenery, and some nice little towns. Sunny Hunstanton is actually pretty nice when it is sunny.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; The likelyhood of the UK unilaterally leaving the EU is literally miniscule. The referrendum isn't designed to leave the EU -- it is a complex piece of political bargaining to try and force the EU to reform.

I have heard this argument, but I'm not sure I understand it. A vote to leave the EU will render further EU reform moot; a vote to stay in the EU will strengthen the UK's position because… the UK has chosen to remain in the EU?

I suspect most of the EU sees that referendum as an internal UK matter, arising from internal Conservative party angst. But clearly the no vote there is not going to be ""literally miniscule"" - the split is not going to be 99% yes and 1% no.

A significant number of people in the UK do want to leave the EU. I don't think that feeling is particularly widespread in Scotland.

&gt; But it is far from certain that Scotland would automatically join the EU or even be allowed to.

There are a couple of things you can be certain about - the referendum decides *if* Scotland should leave the UK rather than *when*, and nobody out of Scotland/rUK/EU would benefit from Scotland being temporarily outside the EU.

Although most of the delay for EU applicants is due to harmonising their local legal systems with EU law (a process that has already been done for Scotland), let's say the EU turned round and said ""OK, it'll take 4 years"".

I don't believe that timetable is realistic (look at the speed with which German reunification, arguably a much more significant event in the EU's history, was completed), but let's say it was. Do you think that a 4 year delay is really significant when the decision is about where Scotland should be in 50 or 100 years?

&gt; I think if you look into the current opinions of forces personnel it's less about jingoistic nationalism and more about simple career prospects.

That argument is made about people outside the forces too. It's why many people in Scotland, and a great many from other parts of the UK, all gravitate towards the south east - it's where the money is.

And yet people do have motivations other than money in their lives. Our armed forces are professionals - some of them will choose to move from the UK forces to Scotland, and the newly enlisted will also make a choice.

I don't think it's realistic to believe that Scotland would be unable to raise the armed forces it would want.

&gt; My suspicion is that there won't be independence.

Ever? Scotland has clearly benefited from participating in the UK, but I don't think you can assume that the relationship must exist forever simply because it does now.

To my mind, Scotland has as much if not more to gain from positive participation with our EU neighbours.

&gt; Statements like yours are the sort of naive thoughts of younger adults - with very little to lose, and more interest in the philosophical aspects of independence. But I garuntee when you are in your 40s, with children to look after, a job to hold down and bills to pay that the thought of change on this scale will send a cold shiver down your spine.

Unfortunately, I am in my 40s with a job to hold down. I also have the requisite wife, children, and mortgage to look after. And yet I am still planning to vote yes in 2014.

&gt; Sometimes risking stability isn't worth small rewards, and from the polls that seems to be the opinion of the majority in Scotland.

Maybe so. Although I think the claims of risking stability are largely overblown - I remember many of the same claims being made about devolution itself in 1997 (interestingly, ""[uncertainty](https://lh3.ggpht.com/-n9XvfLtGhJI/UR7ZrbB_32I/AAAAAAAAANs/qlYnw5zzZU0/s1600/Donegallplacebelfasthomerule.jpg)"" was also the overriding theme over Irish Home Rule).

I am moderately left-wing but have been pretty apolitical to date. Sometimes I vote, sometimes I don't. I have never voted SNP, but the fairly sensible way they've governed Scotland for the last two terms has impressed me.

I didn't attend the march, but went to the rally afterwards just to get a feel for who was taking part. There were your usual groups of Radical This and Socialist That, but I would say 75%+ of the people there were utterly normal - people in their 20s to their 70s, all planning to vote yes.

I don't see it as divisive at all. It's not about ""getting at"" England, or saying that Scotland (or Scots) are somehow better than other countries. It's about looking at the political direction that the UK is going in, and deciding you'd prefer something else.

Perhaps the vote will pass, perhaps it won't. We've been promised further devolution in the event of a no vote, but perhaps it'll be a repeat of 1979 (alternatives to devolution were promised by the Conservatives if Scotland voted no, Scotland voted no, the subsequent three Conservative governments took no steps towards devolution whatsoever).

But I am reasonably sure that I will see independence in my lifetime. I am absolutely sure that my children will.",0,1379876763,null,0,1379877647,0,ccdbd2s,t3_1mud29,t1_ccdbd2s,t1_ccd5iaj,null,1429378651,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The burger patties sweat out a puddle of grease each time you cook a set (eight per half-grill at the store I worked at). After a few sets you have to stop and squeegie the grease into buckets (long and thin, letterbox shaped things) on either side of the grill, because it has entirely covered the grill.

Breakfast patties fill the plate with grease in a _single set of six_.

On the plus side, the egg mcmuffins are actually made with real eggs, contrary to popular belief. Its just a little circular metal ring, they're cooked on the same hot plates as the patties are.

The last labour government made some important reforms that were necessary - don't forget devolution was effectively facilitated by them. But they will be forever tarnished by Iraq -- both north and south of the border. The current conservative/lib dem government have been seemingly bizarre. Ultimately Scots might not have voted conservative - but nobody in the British isles voted for our current government...  

There have been some interesting articles looking at this recently showing actually while the Scots are slightly more left leaning both are actually shifting slightly rightwards over the long term. 

I agree independence may happen one day - but I doubt it. Bottom line is that union makes sense now as much as it did in 1800... And remaining in a union is the path of least resistance. Personally after the likely no outcome i would like to see more devolution... So  the Scottish government are forced to raising all the cash they spend. It's no wonder people say they are impressed by the way the SNP have governed, after all Alex Salmond reaps all the political benefits of spending money without any of the political consequences of having to raise it through taxation... Hence why Westminster is perceived to serve its own interests while Holyrood is so sparkly-clean. I think that realisation will kill independence in the long term.

So when the Doctor stepped into his own timeline. She fell out of it and into the one place that the Doctor was worried he would end up.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; I suspect this perceived difference in English political direction is as much a machination of the SNP as anything else.

Not really. The smoking ban was introduced a year earlier, they're proceeding with plain-box cigarette packaging and minimum alcohol pricing (both were dropped by Westminster), and then there's the usual canards of prescriptions and higher education.

Independence would mean changes like a written constitution and the removal of nuclear weapons - neither of those would even be proposed at the UK level.

&gt; There have been some interesting articles looking at this recently showing actually while the Scots are slightly more left leaning both are actually shifting slightly rightwards over the long term.

I think independence would give the Scottish Conservatives a much-needed kick up the backside. There are many people who would describe themselves as (small-c) conservative in Scotland, and at present they really don't have a party to represent them.

&gt; I agree independence may happen one day - but I doubt it. Bottom line is that union makes sense now as much as it did in 1800...

Other opinions are available. ;)

&gt; Personally after the likely no outcome i would like to see more devolution... So the Scottish government are forced to raising all the cash they spend.

This was the so-called ""devo max"" option; devolving everything but foreign policy. Unfortunately it was vetoed by the three main Westminster parties so the choice is a simple yes or no.

&gt; It's no wonder people say they are impressed by the way the SNP have governed, after all Alex Salmond reaps all the political benefits of spending money without any of the political consequences of having to raise it through taxation...

Scotland is funded by a block grant; an annual lump sum from the UK Treasury. That money does not come out of thin air - almost all of the money spent on Scotland is raised in Scotland. How Scotland spends that money is up to it.

Now Scotland is, like the UK, running a deficit - we are spending more than we earn. That is not, in itself, unusual (the UK has been running a deficit for the last 30 years). However Scotland is running a proportionately smaller deficit as a percentage of GDP than the UK; about 5% for Scotland, vs 8% for the UK.

I would encourage you to read the latest [GERS report](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Economy/GERS) on Scotland's finances.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; Not really. The smoking ban was introduced a year earlier

That was primarily because it was faster for the comparatively less-busy Holyrood parliament to pass laws on than Westminster, not because the UK was moving in a different direction. Infact you may recall the smoking ban in England was a foregone conclusion at roughly the same time - just differences between the two parliaments meant it took a long time to legislate here. 

&gt; A written constitution and the removal of nuclear weapons

As a lot of commentators have said - even if a yes vote does happen it seems unlikely at the moment that Trident will be coming off the Clyde anytime soon. The leaked conservative plan seems to be to push for it to become an overseas territory of the UK, probably in exchange for concessions in other controversial areas like currency, oil, EU membership and defense. It might not be politically popular either side of the border but the UK can't afford to relocate it at the drop of a hat and the USA/NATO in particular will apply a lot of pressure on Scotland to accomodate the UKs strategic nuclear deterrant (as they won't want to see the worlds 2nd nuclear power unilaterally forced to disarm for purely economic reasons) at least in the short-mid term. I expect it would be about 10-15 years of UK soverign territory and would then become a joint British-Scottish NATO base. The SNP plans for it are pretty ludicrous at the moment... turn it into a port for their 'Navy' which would essentially consist of offshore patrol vessels... but Faslane doesn't have the facilities for those kind of vessels and converting it would be punishingly expensive. Unsuprisingly as a base for submarines over the past 60 years it's made up almost entirely of submarine berths and resupply facilities that are not appropriate for other vessels.

&gt; I think independence would give the Scottish Conservatives a much-needed kick up the backside

I agree there. The conservative brand is so toxic in Scotland that it actually masks the entire right wing which is far from insignificant.

&gt; This was the so-called ""devo max"" option; devolving everything but foreign policy. Unfortunately it was vetoed by the three main Westminster parties.

Actually this makes sense to me - I can see the merits of having a simple yes/no question to try and decisively put an end to this now.. THEN have a subsequent devolution settlement. After all, devo-max isn't a simple thing in its own right - there are a lot of different aspects to consider as to what precisely it will contain. My guess is after a NO vote whatever the devo-max package is will be carefully constructed so as to avoid laying the groundword for a future seperatist movement. After all, one of the biggest arguments for remaining in union at the moment is the fact that both nations are so deeply entangled at an institutional level. Removing that barrier through devo-max is risky for Westminster in the long run... so this makes sense.

&gt; That money does not come out of thin air

I appreciate that - but never the less spending powers largely sit in Holyrood while taxing powers rest with Westminster. Hence why Holyrood can *""do no wrong""*, because it isn't fully accountable for its spending commitments. Just think about some of their most popular policies - free education and prescriptions, while the conservatives austerity programme is universally despised across this land. It isn't really fair that Westminster should bear the burden for necessary fiscal constraint while Holyrood can pass blame onto them for not being able to fulfill their spending desires.

Personally I think it would be good for all involved - it would take some heat off westminster and put power into the hands of Scots at a local level. It's all very easy to say X, Y and Z will be free in Scotland but at some point somebody has to pay for it.",0,1379880910,null,0,1379881257,0,ccdcsfc,t3_1mud29,t1_ccdcsfc,t1_ccdcdw7,null,1429377914,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,b00ks,num30,Sandro,"Notice my criticism was not aimed at the attacking half of our squad.  The realism would be that our keeper has two weeks in a row made the same error against a team we were absolutely annihilating.  One of them got caught and we gave away a free kick, and the second could have seen the game drastically changed.  I'm assuming that both are honest mistakes, but not mistakes that I'd like to see my keeper make two weeks in a row, imagine if it had happened against United, City or Chelsea.  Forgive me for not putting my head in the sand and ignoring an issue just because we got three points.  I believe the talent in the squad we should be better.

My comment in the other thread about us getting lucky was really referring to the fact that we broke the deadlock of a game we were dominating with a minute and a half of stoppage time left.  I know it doesn't matter when you get a goal, as long as you do... but we very well could have walked out of Cardiff with a draw, infact we were dangerously close to doing so.  (Marshall deserves most of the credit here).  That to me is luck or good fortune or whatever you want to call it... 

Don't get me wrong, I'll take calls our way and I'm stoked that we won away from home and I am not trying to be a naysayer about our current squad.  I just know given the talent we have both in our starting XI and on the bench, we can (and should be) finishing off teams earlier than the 92nd minute.

* 35% of all A&amp;E attendances alcohol related, rising to over 60% on weekends

* Almost 50% of violent crimes involve alcohol

* 1/3 of all violent crimes occurred inside or just outside of a pub, bar or club
 
* 80% of 'disorder' crimes involved alcohol
 
* 30% of rapes involved either the attacker or victim being drunk at the time. 58% of men imprisoned for rape were drunk at the time
 
* 116,000 NHS staff were assaulted by people under the influence of alcohol
 
* Alcohol is a factor in 35% of domestic violence cases

* Alcohol was involved in 15-25% of all suicides, and 65% of all suicide attempts. 

(source: http://www.ias.org.uk/uploads/pdf/Women/bs_alcohol_violence.pdf)

So really, if we want more drugs legalised (and we probably should want this for the reasons named above), how about we show that we can be responsible with what we already have? Alcohol is legal, but causes enormous social problems, health problems and crime problems because people abuse it. I know that not all illegal drugs would be abused like this, but frankly the government can't be seen to condone drug use (by legalising it that is essentially saying that it is ok) when we have so many alcohol related problems with a legal drug that has been around for ages and is legislated incredibly tightly.

Note that throughout I talked about abuse, not normal use. I don't believe everybody who ever uses a drug will become a violent, useless junkie.

The worst thing about this PC is that it omits a proper video card, so it won't be very good if you want nice graphics when gaming.

It's not benefit 'fraud' that people are concerned about. Fraud levels are very low, but most people who use the word 'fraud' are using it inproperly. However their meaning is clear. What people actually mean is who 'deserves' to be on benefits. 

A disabled person or someone who worked for a while and lost their job and is busy looking for another - most people would agree that they deserve benefits. 

Someone who dropped out of school, got pregnant and had 5 kids - they don't deserve benefits. Someone who sits at home or in Ladbrokes and drinks all day - also doesn't deserve benefits. They're not necessarily committing fraud, but most members of the public will see that as abuse of the system as it was intended.

While actual fraud (i.e. lying about having more children to get extra benefit, or lying about having a job, or lying about being disabled) may be a small fraction of a percentage, many people do see undeserving people who have made awful decisions and taken no responsibility for themselves who are living a pretty good life on benefits. It may not be luxury, but it can be pretty comfortable.

Just 1hr ago I got back from a mates house. He was annoyed that a new council tenant has moved in next door (4 bedroom old-style terrace on 3 floors). The family stay at home all day and he hears them up all night. He talked to the guy, and they are definitely unemployed. My friend trudges to work at 7am every day and pays £800/month to rent there. It's hardly surprising that it makes people angry and yell about abuse of the system when he works his arse off to live in a nice place that some other family is given for free.

I believe employers are required by law to keep interview notes and send them to you if you request them. Maybe there's no need to go that far but just honestly ask what you could work on to become more indispensable to your industry? What did the other candidate bring to the table that was missing from your application?
  
Also, to put things in perspective, I have attended many interviews as an interviewer (although I wasn't the final decision-maker) and it was a really sad day for me when I realised that even if someone says all the rights things at the right time, you don't LIKE them as much as someone else and they leave you feeling a bit bleh, even if they were lovely people.

I copied out the advice provided by the Samaritans for journalists writing about suicide to explain why a tabloid story about an unfortunate mans death was a shoddy, disgusting piece of journalism, which the OP has misinterpreted as me saying that the Samaritans have claimed that there is no link between economic factors and suicide. Which is obviously not the case.

The problem at the moment is that suicide is linked to recessions as people lose money, as the longer economic stagnation goes on the more people use up their savings, have been unemployed and the like. There are thousands of cuts, all deep, all which influence people's decision to end their own lives.

The problem therefore is that people who are now killing themselves are not doing it because of benefit cuts. They are doing it because of years of economic turmoil, poor understanding and valuation of mental health and inadequate councilling options. Benefits changes can therefore act as a catalyst, but they are often not the cause in and of themselves.

Instead of considering any of this, many journalists are simplifying the issue in order to sell papers and make political attacks, which is shoddy journalism.

true,chrysics,null,null,"Honestly not very enthusiastic about any of these. One of the main reasons the old new one is so ugly is the way they insisted on squeezing 'Everton' into the shield when there just isn't enough space to keep the design balanced when the other main element - the tower - is so narrow. So they've gone and done exactly the same again with these. 

The one on the left is ok-ish, I guess. It's mostly just the old badge, with the shield proportions &amp; the badge/wreath positioning distorted a bit to squeeze the club name in there. I suspect that one will grow on me much more than this season's. I could live with that.

The middle one is just a complete mess. I don't know what they were thinking. 

#3 is the bolder option in some sense, since it moves away from the traditional shield shape. The shape they've replaced it with isn't very exciting, but it retains the internal elements of the crest (i.e. doesn't try to move to some totally bland generic design). It's not great, but I kinda like it. 

[edit: #3 has grown on me a bit already. Definitely my preference out of these options. But I expect #1 will win the popular vote.]

[another edit: I must say, I like how they've dealt with the tower here. Not so fussy as on the old crest, but recognisably the tower from the old crest.

2. Álvaro needs time to bed in that team. I'm not too concerned about his début performance, but he got an assist so not a bad start.

3. No mistakes today. They didn't get a sniff because, unlike Liverpool, they didn't give us one. There are a lot of teams in this league now that can't score against us so long as we don't fuck up - not like it was before, where most teams had quality that we just couldn't cope with.

4. A lot of people were seriously worried that Michu had a lucky start and would tail off. However, it's now fairly obvious that he is vastly less effective as a striker, but he'll always be a threat in midfield.

5. More than learning about ourselves, I'd say I learned a lot more about Palace. They had little to no fight in them today, and from their perspective they need to get results against teams like us at home if they want to survive.

There you can visit Cragside and its Gardens.  Cragside was the first building in the world to be lit entirely by electricity, the old hydroelectric station is still there.  There's also a host of smaller villages and ruins dotting the coast.

&gt;“Mcat is also used. It is pretty horrible stuff and makes the skin smell of fish.
“It is a real problem as it is coagulating in the barrel when it is injected and this is leading to blood clots that can be very dangerous.


""Mcat"" (the proper abbreviation in this fashion is mmcat. Known by those not trying to sound smart as mephedrone.) Is fully water soluble. While coagulating cutting agents are a problem, mephedrone is not to blame.


&gt;These new drugs are putting emergency services under more pressure, all these things have a huge implication for workload.



The drop in opiate use, particularly heroin has lead to a significant drop in ODs and ER visits. Most drug users will never appear on the radar of health services.

&gt;“Most of the mental issues we treat are associated to drugs.”

or is it "" Most of the patients we treat with mental illnesses have tried to medicate or escape their illness with recreational drugs.



Krokodil itself is a frightening concept with all the mystery around it, but it is solely a result of the russian government's refusal to provide opioid substitution treatment for withdrawing users. 

When supplies run low they will synthesise their own opioid, and lacking proper equipment it is commonly highly impure. In the UK when the same thing happens, users seek medical attention where they can be placed in OST. Some may turn back to heroin when it returns, but the constant contact with medical staff means that a some may never go back.

true,Downtotes_Plz,null,null,"Regardless of my IQ, I would like to preface that IQ is merely a single attribute of what makes a person. IQ facilitates quicker learning, (ideally) less errors, and allows for larger leaps to newer ideas. It's a gradient, and high IQ is like starting life with a trust fund; it makes certain things easier, but it's not going to stop you from throwing it away or doing anything remotely useful with it either. For a living I'm an entrepreneur. My favorite hobbies are riddles, video games, and prototyping random engineered creations. Favorite books are on neuroscience. I can't pick just one I'm an idiot moment. I have an abnormally high aptitude for fucking up relationships with girls. I don't know what my IQ is exactly. Once I tested at above 180, but I do not believe that test was geared towards high enough IQ's, which essentially nullifies the results. It's also an unimportant metric; it is what it is and I have no control over it. I can sleep well, remain healthy, etc to do better, but otherwise it's just a number. It's not really something to be proud of because I didn't really earn it. I can only be proud of what I do with it. Socially, it sucks because if I ever make an error, it's HURR DURR you're a genius, and if I ever do anything intelligent or remarkable it's HURR DURR we expected as much.

Mignolet isn't comfortable with it at his feet, and to be honest neither is Skrtel. This is an issue that Rodgers needs to address, much like last season when teams realised that the way to get the ball was to press Allen as he gets it from the defence (until his injury).

I think Gerrard and Lucas also had something to do with it, Gerrard almost seems like he wasn't showing for the ball at times, and don't get me started on Moses and Sturridge just standing on the last man not coming close for a pass.

true,martodve,1972crest,,"Imagine. Javi gets tired of being pushed back and defending, so he decides to go forward without Pellegrini's permission. He lands every pass with excellence, scores and assists with just a few touches. City's coaching staff like that and decide to take the risk and field him at the same place he played once more. The game ends 15-0, Javi scores them all, after the game he laughs and says: ""I guess defending isn't my thing after all."".    
Javi transforms into an even better-looking version of himself. He benches every possible midfielder on the Spanish national team and forces Del Bosque to revolve the team around him, causing Spain to win every single game at least 8-0 with every goal scored or assisted by Javi Garcia. He's like a magnet to trophies, the three stars on our crest now mean ""Three trebles in three years, all thanks to Mr. Garcia"".      
Real Madrid finally show interest, they can break the bank. They offer **ONE HUNDRED BILLION POUNDS**, which is, coincidentally, Garcia's release clause. With a year in his eye, he looks at Marwood and says: ""Thank you for trusting me."", then makes his move back to the Bernabeu, where he breaks his legs on the same slippery fucking floor I cracked my nose last year.        
He's out for six months. And then he comes on to make his debut. But he is not the same. Every time he touches the ball it goes straight into the opposition, resulting in a goal against Real. Everyone at Madrid is shocked. Javi is sent to Osasuna for about six months, where he destroys every opposition, so Real takes him back. But he does not feel at home anymore, so he accepts a random offer from his e-mail, which turns out to be from Benfica. Javi's ok with that, so he packs up his things and goes. There, he spends a couple of years, he finally finds form in a CDM role, he finally feels like he's getting it together again!    
Then an offer comes, it's from Manchester City FC. Javi thinks about it and accepts just as the window closes. A week later, he scores on his debut, he feels the power is coming to him again. A season passes and Javi is still gathering power, but frustrated because of the crappy situation that keeps him in defense. The #14 steps up and starts commanding the midfield. City wins by a huge margin. And the rest is written in the stars..

The sausage patties are made in 16's not 6 though. And of course the meat leaves grease: it's meat. It contains fat. Ever cooked bacon? Grease. Sausages? Grease. Mince? Grease. Pork contains more fat than beef hence the differences. And if you were trained properly you should be removing the grease after EVERY run of meat not when there's too much to cook. 

Shake/sundae mix is similar because, guess what, ice cream and milkshakes have really similar ingredients. That shit should only dry badly if the crew haven't been trained (and followed up on) to clean it properly. The only nightmare machine is the old Taylor as it's a bitch to fill/ strip daily. 

The cashier won't know when the lettuce was last replaced, and any grill/ BOP crew/managers should be able to manage their stock levels. If they're not, you probably don't want to be eating there, full stop. 

The real thing most likely to cause sickness is the milkshakes/ice cream. Generally because people don't remember to wash their hands before putting on gloves (if they even do) when adding more mix. This is a problem because it is usually someone from the grill that's doing it and they've been in contact with meat.

He has 40% of our league goals (I know dumb stat lol) and he has been working tirelessly at creating chances for himself and most importantly the rest of the team. His intelligence at the striker position is on par with Jermaine's and he has been inches away from multiple goals in the two games since the international break (most notably the post backheel vs norwich, and the rebound off Gylfi's fantastic crossbar effort today). He is a poacher, and his goals will come from 6 yard box scavenging and service from others. The lads have been creating for each other extremely well in the past 2 games and the goals are about to start rolling in.

Sidenote: As one of the people who is still excited about Harry Kane's potential, it's comforting to know that he is staying at the club, making appearances, and getting to learn from masters of the fundamental striking craft like Jermaine and Soldado. He couldn't ask for a better situation to be in at his age.

As a Brit living in Japan who regularly comes into contact with with many different people who think of their particular flavour of English being the correct one, it seems to me that it makes sense sometimes to refer to each individually. 

Saying that British English should be referred to as just ""English"" is obviously not warranted, however to say that British English is lucky it hasn't been driven into obscurity is absolute nonsense. English spoken in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, India and even South Africa has far closer roots to British English than it does to American English.

I am not in any way trying to claim that British English is superior, just that American English isn't quite as dominant as you seem to think it is.
