true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; I can imagene plenty of examples where it could happen. My point is if it did happen it would not be the fault of the cyclist. It would almost defiantly be as a result of ignorance, not driving I'm a safe manner or anger on the drivers part.

&gt; Unless a cyclist swerved into the centre of the road with little or no warning no driver need hit them.

I guess you have never encountered blind corners, hedges, parked vehicles or other obstructions that might prevent someone from seeing something until they pass said obstruction. 

The highway code you keep quoting also mentions that *cyclists* should ride with due consideration. By that rational they are *obliged* to consider a fast moving lump of metal travelling towards them from behind and how by cycling in the centre of the road, they are placing themselves directly in its path. 

Consideration remains a very much two way street. 

&gt; Prepare for some bad news - do a search for ""taking the lane"". You will find its a policy advocated by many if not all motoring(well, the AA atleast) and cycling groups, advocates and training schools.

Happily then, it hasn't caught on. Nor would I feel safe *as a cyclist* practising this. 

Look, I've checked your post history and you seem the militant sort. I don't expect much of this to sink in but since you keep parroting safety as the most important thing - let's agree that it is for a moment and consider the safety implications of deliberately positioning yourself in the centre of a road whilst travelling a comparatively slower speed to other traffic on said road. The only logical conclusion can be that it leaves you open to more harm and that adopting it as the default position to be in is a ridiculous state of mind. 

Any driver will have passed a hazard perception test - perhaps cyclists ought to have one as well so that they can consider what might be a threat to them on the road. The fallacy that cyclists are angelic road users who would be fine if it weren't for all those pesky cars is a silly attitude to take and the sense of entitlement is sickening. 

The solution? *All* that needs to happen is some mutual consideration. By all means take the centre road if an obstacle or danger is ahead - but don't choose it as the default position in which to be - forcing everyone trying to pass you to take action. Similarly cars should consider their speed and distance relative to cyclists when passing so that they can do so safely. Everyone wins.

I know that one of my friends also moved into our school in third year because her state senior school was so bad. 

Abolishing private schools is just ignoring the problem of poorly run state schools by getting rid of any competition they face.

In some industries you'll be just fine if you accept the first job and then quit after a coupla weeks to take the second, because there are a huge number of employers and employees.

In my particular profession, it's quite incestuous with a small number of very highly skilled people who all know each other both professionally but more importantly socially.

They might hold it open - looking for good staff is surprisingly expensive and time-consuming - or they might not, especially if you are, umm, more of a replaceable cog in the machine than a rockstar.

true,Eddie_Hitler,cnty-uk,Scotsman in East Anglia,"I'm not bashing soldiers either.  They do a very dangerous job to an extremely professional and high standard without complaining, no mean feat considering how the MoD have shafted them with the wrong kit and whatnot.

That said, I don't idolise or beatify soldiers.  There are an awful lot of them who are sneering, thuggish cunts who think that being in the Army gives them a free pass to do what they please, especially when home on leave.  They're only in the Army because it was last chance saloon to straighten out before they ended up in prison for years on end.  This is particularly true for infantry regiments and to some extent the Royal Marines.

You also get the middle class Officer rah types who go to university, then Sandhurst (or they join the OTC and get sponsored by the Army through their studies meaning they can avoid Sandhurst to a great extent).  They'll stay in the Army for about 25 minutes, quit and instantly get well paid jobs in the City or similar where they strut around walking on water because being in the military has made them better than anyone else.  They also tend to force a certain attitude and military values on other people - if the army was so great then why leave?  Probably because *ex-Army = instant hire*

Don't get me wrong.  I really do think HM Forces do a great job and the MoD/government would kindly refrain from shafting them, but servicemen and women aren't Gods and should be treated objectively like anyone else.

It's interesting to see things from the other side though.  We might think that the military is a hard world and a very regimented life which would suck balls for most and only a select few can properly hack; however, I saw an interview with an Army PTI (Physical Training Instructor) who said they see it the other way round and it's 9-5 civvy street office work, mortgage, bills etc. - **that's** the hard world which nobody wants according to them.",0,1378682258,null,0,1378682442,0,cc4fjjq,t3_1lz8cc,t1_cc4fjjq,t1_cc4bnh6,null,1429544195,32,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,32

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"&gt;I guess you have never encountered blind corners, hedges, parked vehicles or other obstructions that might prevent someone from seeing something until they pass said obstruction.

all the time - its why the HC requires you to drive to the conditions of the road. And to expect and anticipate the unknown. And of course drive at a safe speed that allows you to stop in a safe distance.

The fact that most car drivers fail to do so (probably because they see the speed limit as a target and not a limit) does not change that nor does it excuse it.


&gt;The highway code you keep quoting also mentions that cyclists should ride with due consideration. By that rational they are obliged to consider a fast moving lump of metal travelling towards them from behind and how by cycling in the center of the road, they are placing themselves directly in its path.

Or....why not ask the car driver to be considerate to the cyclist by asking them to not run them down if they hold them up for a few minutes/hours/days?

&gt;Look, I've checked your post history and you seem the militant sort

i am not a militant cyclist though - but I am very militant when it comes to misunderstandings/misinformation/ignorance regarding cycling and the HC. I drive as much as a cycle and I apply these same standards to my driving and I expect the same from others.

If I was a militant cyclists Id be anti car, I'm not anti car. I'm anti idiot driver or rider that would put those at risk.

And almost every rule that I spout regarding cycling are very rarely cycling specific. The issues you/some have over cyclists are equally true of horses, slow drivers, pedestrians, animals. The fact that I'm a keen cyclist just means Im drawn to cycling topics. And the fact that many see cyclists as 2nd class road users very much winds me up because it puts me, my family and friends in danger.

I do think though that we might have a slight wire crossed over the subject of taking the lane.

While a cyclist has every right at every time to cycle in the middle of the lane I don't necessarily believe they should - Though I do believe the world would be a much nicer place if car drivers knew the rules regarding it so when a cyclist do feel the need to take the lane they can do so with confidence. My issue is doing so when its required - when its not required I see no reason (personally) to do it.

But the idea of ""consideration"" is a strange one - and its one largely based on (as iv said) ignorance. There are vids online of drivers honking cyclists because they need to avoid door zones - would you say they believe the cyclist is being inconsiderate based on the fact they know what the door zone is? If they knew what the door zone is would they still honk, or would they be considerate enough not to intimidate a cyclist knowing that what they are doing is because they don't want to get killed?

Iv lost count of the amount of times Iv heard someone say ""if he just moved over I could fit (squeeze) though there""....Yeah, because that's sounds safe.

Because being considerate will get you killed due to bad drivers - and of course if there where no bad drivers cyclists wouldn't need to be inconsiderate...

&gt; The fallacy that cyclists are angelic road users who would be fine if it weren't for all those pesky cars is a silly attitude to take and the sense of entitlement is sickening.

Well...Not wanting to be pedantic but if not for cars only about 10 cyclists a year would die. 

But I understand the point you're making - im critical of all road users who break the rules without good reason - cyclist, driver, pedestrian.

&gt;Is that so hard?

Yes...and no....and sometimes.

like doorzones/narrow roads (see comment about squeezing past a cyclist) the perspective of a cyclist (as im sure you know) can be very very different to that of a car driver. Car drivers who never have cycled (most of them) constantly fail to empathise with cyclists - they see their actions as careless, disruptive, dangerous, antagonistic when they are often not...

This whole conversation though boils down to one simple truth - Take the lane if you fell its the safest thing to do to. Everything else is secondary.

If you live in your own place and/or intend to stay for at least another couple of years, I would definitely recommend LEDs. The electricity cost is one thing, but keep in mind that good quality LED GU10s do actually last the 5-10years advertised. You're not just saving in terms of electricity, you're saving money on replacing bulbs. Even if you're renting you can take your bulbs with you.

Just up front, with LEDs you'll have the option of different [colour temperatures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature) much like you have with fluorescents: ""Warm white"" (2800K) which is quite close to the light you get from your current halogen GU10s, ""Cool White"" (4000K) which is quite a neutral colour and finally ""Day Light"" (6500K) which is quite a harsh white. It comes down to preference as well as application as to which one works best. 

Without knowing your particular setup, I'd recommend two bulbs depending on whether you have dimmers installed or not. If you're dimming, [Megaman 6W](http://www.megamanuk.com/products/led-lamps/professional-series/reflector/gu10/141401/). They have a 7W version as well, but the extra cost is not worth it if your current installation is well designed; should you need the extra oomph, though, then perhaps go for it. The current batch comes with a two year warranty for either of them. If you don't have dimmers, [Kosnic 6W](http://www.kosnic.com/products/2747/).

true,Jazzspasm,cnty-expat,"Expat - Yorskshire, then London, currently the Colonies","Scientists shocked, SHOCKED to discover that our ancestors might not have been randomly throwing rocks at the sky but perhaps may, maybe, have had some kind of plan that we're not aware of but can speculate about.

""It appears that we don't have a clue"", said one scientist. ""However, we can confirm that something was going on and they weren't just bearded idiots that bashed rocks against their foreheads.""

That particular archeologist later specified that ""of course, that's just speculation. I wouldn't like to actually say either way.""

""Our digs suggest some kind of pattern which I can talk about without any sense of authority because much like everyone else, I haven't got a clue.""

Previous theories suggest that the people who built Stonehenge might have done it for some reason, perhaps even a purpose, and more surprisingly, a purpose we don't understand.

""I think we should turn it into a theme park. After all, that what it was back then, int it?"" Said Barry Starbucks. ""Silly daft beggars only did it because they had sod all else to do, eh""

What we can all confirm is that ancient men and women didn't build Stonehenge because of any connection between themselves, the earth and the wider universe. 

Mr Starbucks added, ""If any of that nonsense were true, then we'd know it by now, wouldn't we?""

While it's comforting to know that ancient man didn't have a clue after all, lacking penicillin and computers, or even the ability to leave evidence of maths, language or any kind of science whatsoever behind, proving how primitive they were - we will always wonder at Stonehenge and how those incredibly thick and ridiculous, unwashed and disease ridden, basically just-made-it-out-of-the-caves primitives somehow put together a feat of engineering genius that leaves modern engineereds completely stumped, be they architectural, cosmological, astrological, geospacial, historical, sociological, psychological, economical, mathematical, logistical, geological or archeological engineers - all completely without answer. Which is why it's just a museum piece and should be treated as such.

What is comforting is knowing how much more advanced we are than those smelly, bearded cavelike people who built it, probably slaves because speculation, and doing it totally randomly because there's no evidence to prove otherwise. Really, it's not like anyone would volunteer, right. There's even remains of bones, proving that many people died around there. That must have been primitive sacrifice. Right? There's no way those fur wearing, one step beyond monkey, superstitious, non electronic device using primitives could possibly know something we don't.

Right?

*The visitors centre is open 6 days a week.*

*Personally, I suggest you book to go there at dawn, turn up an hour beforehand. Don't just turn up, book ahead.*

*Do it the week before or after summer or winter solstice, before or after the crowds. Get yourself in amongst the stones.*

*Go quietly. Be reverential. Open your heart and your mind. Have no expectations.*

*I've seen people lose their shit - kids start singing, folk leap about , running around laughing and holding their faces, some break down in tears. I once saw a person scream out loud and then sit down, smiling. Some, most just stand quietly with their eyes closed. Everyone takes photos of course. Some feel nothing at all, but a faint tingle for being there, as they would anywhere special, like a pretty sunrise. That last is most people. The others are slightly less common but it happens more often than it doesn't*.

Meanwhile:

""Latest research suggests Stonehenge may have served as some kind of communual function, perhaps as a hospital or school, or parliament, or meeting place or centre for healing or simply random and brutal, primitive sacrifice because they had no control over their crops like we do today with science and more science and don't actually sacrifice anything at all. Do we?""

""What can't be confirmed and must never be mentioned because there's no evidence for it, is the unscientific idea that perhaps back then, people were connecting themselves with the earth and the universe. That is, of course laughable, because we haven't figured it out despite being so much more advanced than those funny people who had beards and wore furs. Or maybe they didn't wear furs and have beards. Who knows? But the probably did. Maybe. I don't know. But they were definitely thicker than us. Which is reassuring.""

It is the most common question asked when it comes to LFTR and confuses most people. 'If it is so good why didn't we do it before.' 

[This video attempts to explain that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbyr7jZOllI)

Essentially it was a combination of special interests and growing military paranoia meaning nuclear tech that could produce bombs as well as power was a sustainable business model.

The way I like to explain it though is that sometimes history throws up technology that gets overlooked for the wrong reasons. Take the diesel engine for example. Did you know that the inventor of the diesel engine, a [Rudolf Diesel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Diesel) first [demonstrated his engine in Paris at the World Exhibition in 1900 using peanut oil?](http://www.dieselveg.com/rudolf_diesel.htm) His own vision was for farmers to use his engine to work the crops that would also fuel their engines. 

Alas he died under mysterious circumstances and the oil industry convinced us we need petroleum based fuels for diesel engines. It took 100 years before we revisited Diesel's original vision and started raving about the the virtues of biofuels.

If you really want to freak out about how technology can be lost then you might want to learn about the [2000 year old computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Nzo2QEbk90) and just imagine what if....

true,Gettingworst,num26,,"Any football formation can be boiled down to creating triangles all over the pitch. the reason some teams are better at it is all down to the personnel in position. the midfield is the important part of AVB's 4-3-3 system, he need technical and versatile players and not someone who can only stick to one position. As I've explained in previous tactical post a few months ago, the midfield 3 and the 2 ""wide"" players has to be mobile with a good brain who can interchange with each other to fill in the gaps and create triangles to press forward. With the players we had last season, AVB can't really put that formation to test because we lack the personnel, but I think we'll see the team being pushed more and more into a 4-3-3 especially after they have more time to gel. 


I'm afraid Dawson will be left out sooner than later because at this time, he's our weakest link when we are trying to play a high line and he lacks the pace to cover the gap between himself and Lloris.

People do change there degrees, but it usually means starting from the first year again. Also living costs will be different depending on where you choose to study, London is a lot more expensive to live in compared to say Sheffield.

Also is it a Bachelors or a Masters degree you wish to study, as these have different tuition fees.

Visas are another thing, the UK Boarder Agency looks into student visas very seriously, as some people use them as a way to get into the country to work and not study (which is illegal). Also you will be asked can you look after yourself financially for your period of study.

It'd most likely be for a Master's degree, but again, I'm not certain. Some general information about the experience of applying and testing would be really helpful. Would the school help arrange visas, or is it an endeavor I'd have to undertake myself? Do they check to see if you are able to finance your studies? If so, how do they do this?

By general education, I mean classes that (at least here in the US) EVERYONE has to take their first year or two, that are unrelated to what you're ultimately going to study/get a degree in.

Assuming you get accepted by a university, you'll then have to apply to UKBA for a student visa (properly known as a Tier 4 visa). You need to meet the criteria in all five of the following areas to have the visa approved:


* Your course of study -- assuming you're studying a normal undergraduate BA, BSc, BEng degree, that's fine
* Your education provider -- again, if it's an accredited university (i.e. one which can issue its own degrees), then no problem
* Your English language skills -- you don't specifically say but I get the impression you're American, in which case I'm sure you've got some kind of grasp of the English language :)
* Confirmation of acceptance for studies -- this one's straightforward, you don't get the visa approved until the university confirms it's accepted you
* Your money -- this is the trickiest part. Over and above the cost of tuition (which could be around £20k p.a. for international students) you **must** prove to the UKBA that you have enough money to live on while you're studying. This means that you have to show you will be able to have immediate access to at least £800 per month (£1,000 per month if in London).

That's a broad summary of the rules. In actuality they're very detailed and with lots of small print to adhere to, though, so do spend as much time as possible reading through the [Tier 4 student requirements pages](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/studying/adult-students/) on the UKBA website.

For this as with all other immigration questions, you're most likely to get the best help over on /r/IWantOut.

They vary greatly. My main banking is with HSBC, and I'm happy with the online system. Natwest's online system seems OK (but that's from looking over my partner's shoulder), Nationwide's always seemed a bit iffy to me, not a fan of their login process. 

With HSBC, the phone service could be better. Needs a way of speaking to a rep about non-account related things without having to enter details, and they all do seem to be Indians... but they do seem to be able to help with all the queries I've had once I've deciphered what they're saying.

Well, there is and there isn't.

There is an obscene amount of money in a tiny handful of top clubs, but for the majority of the rest (including virtually every club outside the premier league) they run at a loss or scrape by.

Added to which, one of the reasons for the money is the fact that ticket prices have risen to the point where a family who have supported a club for years can hardly afford to go to a single game any more, let alone be regulars.  Player's agents often make the excuse that the big players deserve the high wages because they bring the money in through ticket sales, when in fact that opposite is true.  Ticket prices *have to rise to be able to afford the players.*  They're a massive drain on finances, and have pushed the game, especially at the top level to the point where it's now becoming difficult for many fans to afford it any more.

Frankly, it's just like every other industry today.  A small handful of people at the top become obscenely wealthy, and their salaries rise exponentially, while everyone else gets poorer.",0,1378709206,null,0,false,0,cc4nzcd,t3_1lz8cc,t1_cc4nzcd,t1_cc48ert,null,1429540187,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

Motorway driving is probably much the same as you are used to, though you have to bear in mind that we have **lane etiquette** here which I don't believe you do.  That is, you should always be driving in the leftmost (outermost) lane that you can safely drive in.  You're expected to move right to overtake (undertaking is ~~illegal~~ generally considered reckless driving), and then move back left as soon as it is safe to do so.

Dual carriageways are much the same though we have a healthy sprinkling of **[roundabouts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundabout)** which can be pretty tricky if you're not used to them.  I know they're uncommon in the US, but I've no idea if Canada has them or not?  Once you have confidence they're fine but I found them hell when I was learning!

Otherwise, our towns and cities really vary.  There's no nice grid layout so it can be pretty difficult to find your way around, you need to be on the lookout for signs as you go (and definitely use a satnav!).  Small roads and frequent turnings may be awkward to get used to, there can be a lot going on.  You can always take a look through streetview on Google maps to get an idea of what you're letting yourself in for though.

If you enjoy driving and you're confident, I don't see why you wouldn't be able to get along fine.  Do bear in mind that most rental cars are manual transmission in the UK, so make sure to specify automatic if that's what you know.

To be honest though, I'd suggest taking the train instead.  Our public transport system isn't cheap, but it is pretty decent.

This is where the LFTR differs though  as all the science has been shown to work as expected and all the characteristics mapped. [Alvin Weinberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_M._Weinberg) who aside from being the original designer and  patent holder  of the current Light Water Reactors, was a big advocate for Thorium and Molten Salt reactors. In his own words he was not happy with his design that used high pressure water and required to be monitored at every section in every stage and wanted to pursue a safer more efficient reactor based on Thorium. To this end, as the director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, he pioneered two research reactors. The [Aircraft Reactor Experiement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_Reactor_Experiment) and the [Molten Salt Reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten-Salt_Reactor_Experiment). These ran for several years each and good science was taken from it. The over all assessment was positive but as outlined in my previous posts politics and an incumbent industry meant it was not politically attractive, and when Weinberg started publicly to expose the inherent risks and talk about safety with the reactor HE designed, he got quietly sidelined and was eventually removed from ORNL and the project died.

There is nothing wrong with skepticism and I encourage everyone to be critical in their thinking when it comes to things that seem too good to be true. But do go down that rabbit hole.

Already Murdoch-inspired politicians in the UK have cut the BBC budget so severely that the BBC World Service now offer a reduced service. In many countries overseas, the World Service is the only impartial source of information.

On the flip-side, if everyone else is doing it, is it fair to you that you don’t get it too? Isn’t the whole point of the system that people like you do get helped out and it’s up to the government to make sure the system works?

&gt; Why is it right that in a collision between a cyclist and a motorist that the police are told to automatically assume the motorist to be at fault?

It's actually the other way around. Police very often assume fault is with the cyclist—he wasn't wearing a helmet for example but sometimes just for existing. Riding too far from the kerb is an actual category to blame the cyclist for, but even so most incidents are because of substandard driving. It's just a fact.

&gt; Why is it right that in a collision between a cyclist and a motorist that the police are told to automatically assume the motorist to be at fault?

Because it saves lives. Currently drivers can largely get away with killing a cyclist and be back on the road with in a year or so, even when they are proven to be at fault; whether eating a sandwich, blaming the satnav, using a mobile, and simply saying ""didn't see him"" is enough to remove most culpability. The collision becomes just another ""accident"". [Strict liability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_liability) is a method of balancing the threat. The cyclist even cycling insanely is hardly a risk to anyone but himself. Inversely the very action of driving round 2 tonnes at 30mph or more is the danger. Even good drivers driving well kill people because it's inherently dangerous. You should also acquaint yourself with the idea of a [moral hazard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard) because driving is a perfect example—the risk of driving is outsourced to pedestrians, people riding bikes, and the insurance company. Strict liability makes it clear who should be bloody well paying the most attention on the roads, and reintroduces at least some risk if only deferred.

The point is mooted anyway because stats show that the driver **is** usually to blame anyway.

I think in light of the current revelations from Edward Snowden, people are far more likely to be intrigued by these sorts of things than they would have been a few months ago- and quite rightly so in my opinion.

I honestly don't know if this is a hoax or not, and this certainly isn't  usual m.o for the Lincolnshire poacher, but I would say the discussion generated by the original thread was fascinating; we didn't manage to conclusively prove anything really, but further to the original article, reddit was able to find out about the block of associated telephone numbers, and the link to Simon Mason.

What I don't understand is why someone who is known for their love of numbers stations, and who's known as a collator of data on the subject would have set up such a hoax in the first place? But it cannot be ruled out, unless Mr. Mason gets back to us.

But having said that, using a phone line to transmit this makes no sense, but then I guess that's the whole point of espionage! 

So there's nothing conclusive, and let's face it, unless we get a whistleblower popping in here, we're never going to know.

No. It goes on government salaries, buildings, equipment, military, more of their salaries and their pensions, shitty artwork, maintaining ancient monarchy... You wish it all went on education and roads. Here is some government waste to look over.


    £53 billion - Additional cost of funding pay and pensions for public sector workers over and above the private sector average, based on analysis of figures from the Office for National Statistics and the Pension Policy Institute
    £25 billion - Amount wasted through inefficient public sector procurementand poor use of outsourcing, based on an authoritative report from the Institute of Directors
    £20.3 billion - Cost to the economy of public sector fraud, according to the National Fraud Authority
    £5 billion - Amount paid in benefits to those with an income in excess of £100,000
    £4 billion - Losses to the taxpayer from RBS and the sale of Northern Rock
    £2.9 billion - Amount spent needlessly by the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills and Department for Culture, Media &amp; Sport, which should both be scrapped
    £1.2 billion - Annual subsidy to foreign farmers through the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy

Our figure is almost certainly an underestimate. A rigorous assessment of the public sector efficiency commissioned by the European Central Bank found that if the UK’s bloated  public sector were as efficient as that in the economies of countries like the US, Australia, and Japan, no less than £137 billion could have been saved in the last year.

In addition to the big ticket items, we have identified hundreds of examples of smaller sums being wasted. It is, however, all still taxpayers’ money and there is no excuse for waste, regardless of the amount involved. Among the culprits identified are:

    Arts Council: Gave a £95,000 grant to artists in Brighton for “Skip”, a rubbish dumpster outlined with yellow lights
    Crawley Council: Spent £5,070 on 12,200 hot drinks from vending machines for council employees, when the equivalent number of tea bags would have cost just £200
    Department for International Development: Spent £21.2 million on a road maintenance project in Bangladesh, later pulled due to “fiduciary irregularities” after it emerged that less than 10% had actually been spent on roads
    Durham Council: Funded a £12,000 clothing allowance to allow councillors to wear “Geordie Armani”
    Hull Council: Spent £40,000 on a concert in honour of the councillor who is Lord Mayor this year
    Ministry of Defence: Paid £22 for light bulbs that are normally 65p
    Prison Service: Paid £720,000 to professional actors for role playing that is aimed at helping inmates become employed

I can't find the words ""Test my holiness"" at all.

[Here's the post](http://marymagdalen.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/the-trouble-with-poor.html).

It just seems to me like classic public speaking. It starts with the headline ""The trouble with the poor is that they are messy"", which grabs your attention because it's shocking to say, but then if you read on, it basically explains in that sappy Christian way 'poor people can be messy and lie and cheat you and bother you - BUT - you must realise that if you feel like this you have grown complacent and don't want things changed, which is bad, and if the gospels teach us anything it's that it is better to have our lives messed up by poor people and help them, than have everything ordered and perfect and not help them""

It's simply a confession, saying 'I sometimes get annoyed with the drug addicts that come to my church, but then I remember I shouldn't and that it's probably best that they come bother me"" - it's the same boring middle of the road sermon priests will give every single mass.

The journalist has just taken the first part, the part where it says 'I sometimes get annoyed with the drug addicts' - and then made up other quotes to make him seem like a complete twat, and then printed it.

That's really bad, I hate that type of shitty character assassination journalism. Picking on a fucking priest, in atheist Brighton, taking his words out of context and then making quotes up. What a low life.

Anyway, according to the priest's latest blog post, the story has been picked up internationally now, and he is considering giving up blogging because of this original Argus article and the complaints it has generated. So there we go, well done newspaper, bullying and lying works yet again.

What I would say is this: Do **not**, under any circumstances, stretch yourself too far. The reason I say this is that I guarantee you will come up against a hell of a lot of things you never even considered when you looked around the house of your dreams, and every damn one of them will cost you money.  Some of these things will need to be sorted within a few days of moving in. 

Off the top of my head, things I've encountered are:

 - Carpets that are considerably dirtier than you remember them looking. Hire of a Rug Doctor: around £50 by the time you've bought cleaning chemicals. Though IME you need to go over the carpet several times with something like that to have any real effect, so it's a good idea to see if you can get a weekend rate and do the whole house two or three times over the weekend.
 - The previous owner took their curtains with them - every damn set. Expect to pay £30-50 per set for a cheap, thin pair of curtains; that price rises rapidly depending on the size of the window and the quality of the fabric.
 - The floor in the kitchen is shocking. Another thing you failed to spot. Expect to pay around £150-200 for cheap waterproof laminate and a weekend of hard work to fit - you'll find out a couple of years down the line that it wasn't very waterproof. Ceramic or earthenware tiles are lots better, but also lots more expensive.
 - Lots of domestic appliances you now need to own yourself. Boring little things like vacuum cleaner, lawnmower, that sort of stuff. None of it's particularly exciting, but all of it is another drain on resources when you don't need it.

The single best piece of advice I can give you when looking for a house is this: Make a list of things you want in your house.

That list will include:

 - Things you absolutely must have, and will not buy the house if it fails to meet all these criteria. This is usually things that you couldn't fix relatively easily - things like ""off-street parking"" or ""no sign of subsidence"" would usually go on here. (Telltale signs of structural issues are deep vertical cracks in the walls, doors that don't fit properly or have been modified so they are now considerably off square). Your list will include quick, easy ways to tell whether or not the house meets the criteria; you'll write the address of each house you look at on the list and tick it off as you're going around. You need to do this because after looking at 5-10 houses, they all blur into each other!
   - Type this list up and print a copy for every house you see. Save the file and keep it for when you move; there's every likelihood you'll have learned a whole lot of things about what you like and you'll want to build on that list considerably.
 - Things you'd really like to see but can live without. A reasonably new kitchen might be the sort of thing that goes here.
 - Things that are added bonuses. Great if the house has them, not the end of the world if it doesn't. Things that are cheap and easy to fix go in here.",0,1378720129,null,0,1378720776,0,cc4pete,t3_1lz3ng,t1_cc4pete,t1_cc4oy6k,null,1429539520,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Except we will **NEVER** run out of it.  

To produce 1GW of power requires 50sq miles of desert to be bulldozed for solar power or 100sq miles and 1000 windmills for wind power or 350,000,000 tons of coal or 200 tons of Uranium or **1 ton** of Thorium in a LFTR. 


[Thorium is found in small amounts in most rocks and soils; it is three times more abundant than tin in the Earth's crust and is about as common as lead. Soil commonly contains an average of around 6 parts per million (ppm) of thorium. Thorium occurs in several minerals including thorite (ThSiO4), thorianite (ThO2 + UO2) and monazite. Thorianite is a rare mineral and may contain up to about 12% thorium oxide. Monazite contains 2.5% thorium, allanite has 0.1 to 2% thorium and zircon can have up to 0.4% thorium.[60] Thorium-containing minerals occur on all continents.Thorium is several times more abundant in Earth's crust than all isotopes of uranium combined and thorium-232 is several hundred times more abundant than uranium-235.](http://www.targetmap.com/ThumbnailsReports/14104_THUMB_IPAD.jpg)

* Interactive [map here](http://www.targetmap.com/viewer.aspx?reportId=14104)

And we need not stop there. There is plenty of [Thorium on the moon](http://www.spudislunarresources.com/Images_Maps/global%20Th.jpg) and in all the asteroids in the solar system and even [beyond the solar system](http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=22959)

In short if we use Thorium at the efficiencies we get in a LFTR (97-99%) there will be no conceivable scenario in which we can run out of Thorium. You probably have move Thorium just sitting in your garden soil than you would need in your lifetime.

Our version of 'Ivy League' are the [Russell Group](http://www.russellgroup.ac.uk/our-universities.aspx) universities, and though it can look better to have gone to one of them, going to a 'lesser' uni doesn't affect you hugely. Lots of universities also offer a year's study abroad, so a good way to do it might be to go to a US uni and then go to their partner UK uni for a year. Current student fees for UK and EU students are around £9,000 a year - just having a quick look at the University of Nottingham [International Students Fees page](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/fees/tuitionfees/201314/ugcourses201314.aspx) which was the first one that came up for me on Google looks like it goes between £13,000 and £16,500 per year for international students.

We don't have big sports games or big support for college sport teams (apart from Oxbridge rowing, maybe), we don't have the Greek system at all, or names for years other than calling incoming first years Freshers. University is always 'university' or maybe 'college' depending where you go, not 'school'. People tend to live in digs for first year and then live out for years two/three/four.

true,veritanuda,null,null,"For the purpose of educating non-trolls I will explain this as rationally as I can.

&gt; A: That's not very abundant at all.

On the contrary, did you not see the comparison with other fuels. Thorium is energy dense almost as much  U235 with the added advantage of being entirely used up in a LFTR. 

In the UK the average [energy consumption per capita per year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_energy_consumption_per_capita) is  about 37979 kw/h which is 40g  of Thorium per person.

A more graphic representation can be found [here](http://www.globalartwork.com/2010/how-much-fuel-used-in-a-year/)

&gt; B: Just because its available does not mean it doesn't require more either more energy to extract than you can make from it or cost so much to extract that its completely unfeasible to use for energy generation.

Actually Thorium is currently considered a waste material in today profitable Rare Earth mining operations, they have to pay to dispose of it and has no inherent value because it is so common and there is no market (yet) for it. 

&gt;Thorium is hosted most significantly in the minerals: monazite, thorite, uranothorite, thorianite, and within larger mineral structures such as, carbonatite, bastnaesite, allanite and others. The majority of monazite is found in mineral beach sands, as discussed above, in relatively low grade, but in very large tonnages. These mineral sand deposits are typically on the order of billions of tons. Monazite is typically very high grade in thorium and rare earth elements; on average, monazite material grades 6% to 7% thorium. 

&gt;Owing to the high concentrations and the high-grade nature of these deposits, and the fact that they occur at surface, the costs of mining are consequently low and environmental impact is minimal. The ore material, which is sand, can simply be skimmed off the surface by way of dredge mining. The thorium oxide is liberated from the monazite by way of gravitational, magnetic and electrostatic circuit, employing a minimum of chemicals.

&gt;There is a very good reason why Nuclear power never kicked off: there is not economically viable sufficient supplies to power anymore than 10% of our electricity needs for more than 100 years.

Trying to compare a working LFTR with current nuclear technology is like comparing a mule with a sports car. They are simply not on the same scale in terms of efficiency. 

Current LWRs have inherent overheads and require large bodies of water to cool them, this leads to very large and expensive containment building and multiple engineered safety system in the event of an accident. Fuel is also inefficiency used in LWR and require complex and costly reprocessing of the solid fuel.

In contrast in a LFTR works at atmospheric pressure, has walk away safety features and fuel reprocessing can be done done in real time as the reactor is being used which is vastly simpler to perform and require little pre-fabrication.

To use the argument that Thorium reactors could not be economical is either woefully ill-informed or deliberately disingenuous.

It's really not. When I did my time with the TA we'd frequently get 4-6 hours a night for extended periods. It's definitely not fun but you can drop down to that for a few nights quite doably. That said I agree 7 hours is a desirable regular minimum in terms of sleep, but even saying 8, that still allows for 16 hours of waking time per day.

After the call-tracking program was exposed, few people thought twice about attaching the label “surveillance” to it. Government officials, though, have rejected the term, pointing out that this particular program doesn’t involve the NSA actually listening to phone calls—just keeping track of them. Their crabbed definition of “surveillance” allows them to claim that the NSA isn’t engaged in surveillance even when it quite plainly is.](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/07/nsa_lexicon_how_james_clapper_and_other_u_s_officials_mislead_the_american.html)

One of the NSA’s foundational documents states that “collection” occurs not when the government acquires information but when the government “selects” or “tasks” that information for “subsequent processing.” Thus it becomes possible for the government to acquire great reams of information while denying that it is “collecting” anything at all.](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/07/nsa_lexicon_how_james_clapper_and_other_u_s_officials_mislead_the_american.html)

If you would be so kind please provide me sources and figures for the availability of Uranium and it's it current costs to mine, so  I can  use  a known model. Also, if you can give me an example of a typical Rare earth mine's output and its costs to extract wanted minerals and discard unwanted minerals (eg Thorium) again with figures please. 

I studied Geology at college and so it all seems very feasible to me. But if it is true that Thorium is actually being discarded as waste in more profitable Lanthanide mining then I fail to see how it could possible cost more to store Thorium for processing into fuel than what we are already doing. Thorium has only one naturally occurring isotope, has a half life of 4.5 billion years and literally drops out of alluvial sand deposits.

I only have public [sources](http://www.mindat.org/min-2750.html) to rely on so any more detailed industry information you can provide would be great. 

We need to have this open debate and discussion. We need to have the figures. We need to have the case to make and so the more information available the better it is.

From the wiki page on Peak uranium:

&gt;European Commission
&gt;The European Commission said in 2001 that at the current level of uranium consumption, known uranium resources would last 42 years. When added to military and secondary sources, the resources could be stretched to 72 years. Yet this rate of usage assumes that nuclear power continues to provide only a fraction of the world’s energy supply. If electric capacity were increased six-fold, then the 72-year supply would last just 12 years.[55]

&gt;OECD
&gt;The world's present measured resources of uranium, economically recoverable at a price of 130 USD/kg according to the industry groups OECD, NEA and IAEA, are enough to last for 100 years at current consumption.[140]


Basically there is only enough Uranium to supply about 5% to 10% of needs for the next 100 years. It is completely unfeasible to replace oil/coal/gas with Uranium.",0,1378728395,null,0,false,0,cc4qhck,t3_1lz4f3,t1_cc4qhck,t1_cc4qfbq,null,1429539020,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It's actually *""well regulated""*, which is a slightly archaic way of saying ""properly discipled"" or ""in good working order."" 

But many people miss that the ""militia clause"" is a subordinate clause. The best example is if we had something like this in our Constitution:

&gt;&gt;A well-educated electorate being necessary to the preservation of a free society, the right of the people to own and read books shall not be infringed.

If that was in there, no one in their right mind would read that and think that because comic book, cook books, trashy romance novels, and speculative fiction are arguably useless in creating a ""well-educated electorate"" that they we not protected books under this amendment. 

No one would think that this amendment was a specific mandated that the government schools could loan books to students, but only in classrooms, so the kids can learn about government. No one would think this amendment somehow granted government powers while oddly being buried in a list of things the government is specifically not allowed to do.

Finally, if this amendment was repealed, we would all pretty much go on assuming we had the right to own and read books anyway, without the government having to giving us specific permission first. They would have to pass and ratify another amendment specifically granting government the power to ban books.

Yes in theory if you are good at time management and are mature and focused (as you are from the sounds of it) then doing 'extra-curricular' responsibilities such as a part-time job won't negatively affect your studies. But many students aren't like this; bearing in mind most students are between 18-21 years old, which I think most people can agree was not a time in their life when they were at their most responsible (I actually think doing a degree straight after school is a terrible idea, but that's a different discussion...). So I find the attitude of 'Oh just get a job you lazy git' massively insensitive and a coarse attitude. 

What it basically sounds like to me is: 'you may not be good at time management, may find it difficult to focus on your work or deal with stress because you are only at the beginning of your adult life, but if you don't have financial support from home then you don't deserve help, you'll have to take on more responsibilities and stress. Why? Because life is shit, and we shouldn't try to make it easier for people'. Yes this is an exaggeration, but do you see where I'm coming from?

Perhaps I'm biased because I have and continue to have problems with stress management leading to chronic fatigue, so looking for and taking on a part-time job again would be massively emotionally draining for me. I imagine (and hope) that most young adults don't have these problems. 

Does that mean that I should have my studies negatively affected just because I have stress/energy issues? I'd argue no, because this degree is extremely important to my future working life and higher education benefits not just the learner but everyone in society economically. So putting barriers in the way of academic excellence isn't really helping anyone.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;He didn't reduce the number of research engineers in the UK, the opposite he increased them.

You're right - there's no irony if you avoid looking at the issue overall.

&gt;Also the fact you refuse to engage with the notion that he might have had many reasons for wanting to move production away.

The reasons were well documented at the time. He didn't like having to deal with the local council, naming them specifically as a primary cause for leaving.

&gt;the fact they had just withdrawn their supermarket business wouldn't effect the credibility of their claims.

Only (again) if you don't look at the overall picture. Do you really think the press would decide that Tesco were actually good guys despite sacking all those staff because they were employing some more under a seperate business elsewhere? That's right up there with their full-page ads telling us about how Tesco are 'working with farmers' when it's easy enough to find out (to the point of common knowledge) how they *really* treat farmers. At that point, what difference does it make how much experience their CEO has?

&gt;Where do those companies make their devices?

I'm not sure that really matters when taken out of context. It only matters if they shift production abroad and then want praise for employing a few more people locally.

&gt;And where are they made? How are their sales doing. Is the main market UK domestic or international. Is it mostly EU or APAC or US? Do they do much with SA?

See above. None of the above questions are relevant unless the companies involved had a hissy fit about the law a few years ago, moved production abroad to avoid it and now want praise because their designers (and more importantly, CEO) didn't want to emigrate with them.

&gt;Honestly you don't appear to come across as someone who is an accomplished engineer or has ever made anything for manufacture. 

Which (still) makes zero difference.

&gt;You appear to come across as a bit of a small minded person when it comes to having a global business

Yeah, that must be it. I have zero experience of international markets because....you've guessed badly :-)

&gt;you dismiss, outright, without consideration, anything that challenges your views

Not true. You have to provide something more than 'this is big business! You couldn't possibly understand!' for it to really count as a challenge in the first place.

&gt;anything that the man behind the company says about why he moved operations

I read a lot about it back when it happened, and have referenced those events...but of course, he's running a company so it *must* be that black and white. Remember your words next time Michael O'Leary demands £2 from you to use the toilet on his aircraft - after all, you don't own an airline, what right do *you* have to ask questions? :-) 

&gt; at least don't criticise him because I know I can not manufacture in the UK affordably.

Sure, nothing gets manufactured in the UK in any way at all. Certainly not devices that already cost twice as much as competitors' offerings back when they *were* manufactured in the UK. Odd that prices didn't come down accordingly.

&gt;I at least don't criticise him because I know I can not manufacture in the UK affordably.

Why not? Running a business doesn't give you magical powers - and it's not like Dyson is at Jobs-level of design. The 'ball' he added to his hoovers hasn't changed since he did it in the 70's with wheelbarrows, and they didn't catch on. Adding a rotating beater to your hose nozzle similar to the 'main' one on the hoover is a great idea - until you realise that the suction is being used to drive the motor (so a lot of it is lost). And what about the hand-held dysons, that give just as much suction but come with an unmentioned nasty surprise when you find that the battery lasts less that fifteen minutes? Then there are the bladless fans, which aren't bladeless - hiding the fan inside the chassis doesn't mean it's not there.

&gt;I'd be very happy for anyone to prove me wrong (ie make it cheaper!).

There's the real rub; he moved his manufacturing abroad, saved a lot of money...none of which was passed on to the end price.",0,1378730076,null,0,false,0,cc4qrwi,t3_1lrn4u,t1_cc4qrwi,t1_cc2tyg0,null,1429538884,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I was pre-disposed to dislike her based solely on the fact that I don't actually like anything else I have seen Catherine Tate in, but in all fairness, I don't like Billie Piper either, so Rose wound me up for most of the first series after they brought it back.

I suspect that many people who don't like Donna, couldn't get past the abrasive personality... or her voice, which is rather grating at first. Maybe other people just didn't learn to love the character past the actress?

Also, as an aside, I'm so old that my favourite companion is still Ace. Mainly, I think, because she was the companion at the time when I first started to get into Doctor Who.

Over the last few years the press have liked to portray Arsenal as something of a crisis team, but the fact is that although they are unlikely to win the Premier League or the Champions League, they are a very good team with a manager who rarely lets them down.

As for Spurs, it's really hard to tell. We've lost our best player and replaced him with a lot of new players. Some look excellent, some look less so. We have no idea how they will gel. We might finished 3rd or we might finish 7th.

If what you are saying is correct then all laws would need to have some sort of umbrella amendment for them to be defined under. For example, to make a computer hacking law you'd need an amendment granting the government jurisdiction over the digital world. 

In theory yes. In practice, well the government overspilled it's banks a long time ago. 

For example, they needed to pass the 18th Amendment here to give government the power to ban alcohol, and they later passed the 21st amendment to repeal the 18th which is all well and good, but no one ever questions if the federal government has the power to enforce near total prohibition on the use of marijuana.

They would have a tough time banning everyday books though. Too many everyday people to marginalize. Same with firearms. While the mainstream media generally never met a gun control law they didn't approved of, more than half of all households in the US legally own firearms of one sort or another, so there's still tremendous resistance to any further restrictions.

I disagree. You might mean cycle lanes, but that's not the same as decent cycling infrastructure (and it's also not true, we have more than 25 miles of decent cycle route in the entire country). I'd say at least half of roads in the UK wouldn't be improved in any real way by a cycle lane, and the cost would be ridiculous.  You'd have to claim vast strips of land under emminent domain at massive cost to the government, you'd have to replant hedges, fill ditches, and in the end you'd be left with a cycle lane that gets used once a day tops. There are plenty of roads that need widening, but that's not a bike issue, that's a general road issue.

&gt;Average price is something between 15k[2] and 28k[3] 

The average price **paid** was given in the first link, and it's **£14K**. The average *showroom* price (The price you negotiate down, and not a price that represents what people actually pay) is £29K. Call the average £14K, because the average is £14K. That gives a total private expenditure (the vast majority of which pays material costs and labour) of ~£30Bn

&gt;next part

half of those are ridiculous. If you pay the government in tax and the government spend that money on something else, that isn't twice the cost. If I pay £100 VED and then they spend £100 maintaining roads that's a net expenditure of £100, not £200.

""war for oil"" is ridiculous and if you actually look at the amount of oil we get from Iraq/Afghanistan you can see why

""Increased levels of obesity"" work out costing us less because of the effect on  life expectancy

""Military support"" costs a lot less than the actual billing, because the navy don't cease to cost money when they aren't doing anything

&gt;Cycle paths don't degrade, 

yes they do, and if you don't build them as tough as roads they degrade faster than road surfaces would

&gt;It's 66£ per person in the UK.

so where do you want that money to come from?

 People who only smoked weed because they could get away with it may feel hard done to and drink and drive.

Cycle infrastructure is defined how I define it in this case: segregated space exclusive to bicycles and similar designs. Adding up paint at the side of the road doesn't count, neither do those dirt tracks across the Pennines. I'd probably have to set some minimum interrupt distance because councils like to game numbers by counting a 10 metre strips. Show me how many junctions segregate traffic like they do in Holland.

&gt; I'd say at least half of roads in the UK wouldn't be improved in any real way by a cycle lane, and the cost would be ridiculous. 

That's an interesting stat you've pulled from your arse. Every road is improved by segregated lanes because it saves lives and encourages cycling uptake.

Yeah, I must be insane right? Because I disagree with you and the established obscenity that is car extremism. Of course I have an agenda (a classic smear btw) because I want to see the 200 cyclists killed a year, the 2000 people injured not be just another statistic. 

&gt; However road safety is everyone's responsibility.

Fuck no. You are driving the two-tonne serial killer, it's your responsibility.

&gt; However road safety is everyone's responsibility. That includes teaching cyclists to wear helmets, take an appropriate position in the road and not cycle like idiots.. and also teaching little girls to cross roads carefully. There will always be the argument that being in a car gives you illusion of safety and you're still driving a tonne of metal at speed - and there's truth to it - but that doesn't mean every other demographic of road user can forget themselves and act like tits.

This is why people continue to die. Despite car drivers being the overwhelming cause of death and injury due to irresponsible driving, you are putting the onus on the victims to secure their own safety when they can do nothing more than stopping riding. It isn't the car, the road design, it's the victim's fault. Rape victims should have whistles and not wear short skirts, stab victims should be wearing a stab vest.

Safety is design, and the design in this case is stopping insulting the deaths of people who ride bikes with wilful neglect when it comes to providing a safe environment. 20 mph limits in residential areas as a minimum, enforcing driving standards like tailgating and driving dangerously around pedestrians and riders, but most importantly, segregated cycle paths and meaningful prosecutions.

The lorry in this case is claimed to have had a ""blind spot"" as a mitigating circumstance.

You're not insane for disagreeing with me, but you are for mistaking anything I've said for car extremism when I clearly said that road safety is *everyone's* responsibility. More on that in a moment.. 

&gt; Of course I have an agenda (a classic smear btw)..

Classic it may be - for a reason. But when you have an agenda it's an allegation you'll have to learn to live with. 

&gt; ...because I want to see the 200 cyclists killed a year, the 2000 people injured not be just another statistic...

So do I, that's why I say everyone ought to be responsible for road safety. I'm omitting *nobody* from that expectation. But then we get on to the juicy bit: 

&gt; Fuck no. You are driving the two-tonne serial killer, it's your responsibility.

There we have it. *That* is insanity. Implying any one demographic alone are responsible for the safety of everyone - implying that others aren't responsible for *their own actions* - that's inexcusable. 

Read my comments. You'll see I'm surprised that the lorry driver received a light sentence. I haven't once said anything to imply that drivers should not be targeted in this - or that they're not responsible for their vehicles. They are. **But everyone else are also responsible for their actions on the road**.

&gt; ..you are putting the onus on the victims to secure their own safety when they can do nothing more than stopping riding.. 

Wrong. They can do plenty to *help* secure their own safety whilst still being on the road. Why do cyclists wear lights? Safety. Why do they wear helmets? Safety. Why do they *not* run red lights as I've seen many other cyclists do? Safety. Why do they *not* weave in and out of traffic as I've seen many other cyclists do? Safety. Why should pedestrians be very cautious when crossing roads - and ideally use a traffic light system to do so? Safety. Why should pedestrians *not* walk out from behind large stationary vehicles like trucks or busses? Safety. 

*If you don't take these simple safety steps, you are increasing the risks to your personal safety*. 

You mention rape and stabbings... but why? Both of those are crimes deliberately committed by someone who made a concious decision to do so. Of the 200 dead cyclists and 2000 injured people - are all the other parties involved making a concious decision to attack someone? No. These are accidents that could have maybe have been avoided with proper caution from **ALL** parties. 

&gt; and the design in this case is stopping insulting the deaths of people who ride bikes with wilful neglect when it comes to providing a safe environment.

Then cyclists insult themselves daily by choosing not to wear a helmet or to pass through red lights. Pedestrians insult themselves daily by crossing roads when it is not appropriate to do so. 

&gt; The lorry in this case is claimed to have had a ""blind spot"" as a mitigating circumstance. If it's got such a blind spot it shouldn't be allowed on the road... 

I imagine you haven't ever driven a lorry? Have you not seen lorries and buses with stickers on their rears reading ""if you can't see my mirrors, I can't see you!""? Such is the nature of large vehicles. 

As a disclaimer, I *remain shocked that the lorry driver received so light a sentence in this case*. However your suggestion that nobody but motor-vehicle users are responsible for road safety is laughable. 

And what do I know about all this? I *am* a road user... I walk, cycle and drive. It must be mind-blowing that someone who has been behind the wheel of a big scary vehicle is also a flimsy meat sack on wheels and on legs - but I am. I do all three regularly...

...and I can see it's obvious that if you take to the roads with the opinion that you are not responsible for your own safety, but others are, you are part of the problem and not the solution. **Everyone is responsible for road safety.

true,william-in-the-hague,null,null,"&gt; There we have it. That is insanity. Implying any one demographic alone are responsible for the safety of everyone - implying that others aren't responsible for their own actions - that's inexcusable.

The bigger the threat the bigger the responsibility. If I'm insane then so is anyone with a driving license because they've bought into the idea that the larger threat (ie' motor vehicles) should be held to a higher standard than those that pose little to no threat at all (ie' people cycling or walking). You also have to call the Netherlands insane because they actually apply strict liability.

&gt; But everyone else are also responsible for their actions on the road.

That's just a cop out and a praise for inactivity. Vulnerable road users get killed all the time because of the threat posed even by good drivers. 

&gt; They can do plenty to help secure their own safety whilst still being on the road. Why do cyclists wear lights? Safety. Why do they wear helmets? Safety. Why do they not run red lights as I've seen many other cyclists do? Safety. Why do they not weave in and out of traffic as I've seen many other cyclists do? 

This is classic. Car kills person, that person is to blame.

&gt; Of the 200 dead cyclists and 2000 injured people - are all the other parties involved making a concious decision to attack someone? No. These are accidents that could have maybe have been avoided with proper caution from ALL parties.

When you choose to get in your car and drive you are making the conscious decision to raise the level of threat to every one. If you choose to use a phone or drive a lorry with a blind spot, you are again raising the level of threat even more. As a cyclist I can't kill anyone really but myself, as a car driver you can take out a bus stop full of pedestrians.

&gt; If you don't take these simple safety steps, you are increasing the risks to your personal safety.

I can do all that and more of what you suggest **and still die because the design of the motor-vehicle/road/human combination is atrociously unsafe**. I've come close to serious injury or death numerous times, and any regular cyclist will have similar stories.

&gt; However your suggestion that nobody but motor-vehicle users are responsible for road safety is laughable.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Unless you were there, I'd argue it doesn't say that much tbh.

I've been on a counter EDL demonstration in Bolton and the similar thing happened. I should start by saying that I am not a member of the UAF or any of the Unions who took part in the organisation of the counter demo, I just felt that it was a massive piss-take that the EDL were matching in a place like Bolton (clearly trying to stir things up). However, when me and my friends arrived at the train station we were asked before leaving by a policeman ""Are you EDL or UAF"" we said ""Neither, we're just not racist"" and he said ""UAF then, please head in that direction.""

The reason I mention this is because all the coverage on these matters seems to be 'Us Vs Them' and I have no interest in that. There is always a sizeable ""third party"" which never gets a mentioned because it doesn't fit into the typical paradigm, but they are there because of their own personal ideas.  

I think we all share the same 'anger' to a degree (after all, we're all being shafted by the same cock so to speak), its just that some people misplace that anger imo (sorry EDLers. throwing out foreigners isn't going to make your lives any better).

However, when I was at the demo, I saw blatant examples of police provoking violence, then randomly arresting people. Nothing much was happening until police ran into the square we were being kept in, started punching and arresting people at random, then quickly leaving. Once that happened people started panicking and bunching together, then people started being grabbed out of the crowd and arrested at random.

Also, the ""Asian Community"" were deliberately kept out of the square we were in for hours until the very end. Once they joined in and everyone started chanting together things seemed to become more rowdy and the EDL were pushed / batoned back by police. People on our side of the fray were cheering, although personally I just felt like were being manipulated like a board game or something.

So personally I wouldn't look too much into how many people were arrested as a sign of anything, considering how easy it can be to manipulate those types of things.",0,1378740848,null,0,false,0,cc4tmew,t3_1m0zx0,t1_cc4tmew,t1_cc4qgs5,null,1429537555,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

Similarly, manchester-London is promoted but as they're building a TGV-esque railway, these trains will run to other places off the network too, with the trunk of their journey going faster - see the tragic case in Spain in July as an example of a high speed train running into the slower lines as both an example and potential counterpoint, but the fact is that journeys across the country will be quicker from that trunk - you wouldn't build a motorway into a city centre.

I'd agree that if you're bigger and heavier you have to be more careful - but a child running out in front of a car could cause a multi-car pileup. A cyclist cutting in front of a lorry without looking or indicating could get themselves and others hurt / killed. It's not just about your net mass - it's about how *every* road user has the potential to cause an accident through their actions or inactions. No road user is exempt from that fact. 

&gt; should be held to a higher standard

Why cant everyone be held to the same high standard? If I'm walking I don't suddenly have a change of personality and decide I can do what I like on the road because I'm the slowest, squishiest thing around. If I cross a road I have the same responsibility for my safety and others (and hell, I care about not getting run over) that everyone else should. I should care about crossing the road... the cyclist should care about the pedestrian that looks like they're about to cross the road and the car coming up from behind should care that the pedestrian OR the cyclist may move out in front of the vehicle. Everyone pays attention - nobody gets hurt. 

I'm having a hard time seeing why that's a problem. 

&gt; This is classic. Car kills person, that person is to blame.
 
That's not what I said at all. I provided a list of safety measures that ought to be taken by various road users in order to increase both personal safety and the safety of others. 

And you know what? Other people *can* be to blame. If some kid runs out from behind a parked truck and gets hit by a passing car that had no time to react (even at 20 miles an hour, if you have 1m to stop, you won't stop)... *that kid is to blame* and should have been taught to cross the road in more appropriate places. It's a hard truth - but deal with it - that there are cars on the road is not an excuse for everyone else to forget their personal responsibilities to their own safety. 

&gt; I can do all that and more of what you suggest and still die because the design of the motor-vehicle/road/human combination is atrociously unsafe. 

True, but your chances go up - just as anyone using a motorbike might save their skin by wearing a leather bike-suit over a t-shirt and shorts. It's the same sort of thing. 

&gt; I've come close to serious injury or death numerous times, and any regular cyclist will have similar stories. ...Straw man. Classic victim blaming though through out. I have to presume you have an agenda and you are a recreational cyclist.

You say victim blaming but I don't think you know what it means. If you read everything I have said - not *once* have I said that cyclists are entirely responsible. **Everyone is responsible**. That's my agenda and there's nothing at all wrong with it. Preaching mutual responsibility for your safety and the safety of others on the road? How dare I. 

Recreational cyclist? Well I cycle on roads daily and have been in two traffic collisions as a cyclist - one of which wrote off someone else's car. I don't know how many times you have to get run over in order to know what you're talking about but hell, here I am suggesting that in fact everyone is equally responsible for their own safety.

The downside of this is that rolling stock is therefore considered an investment: the leasing company will look at the cost of the stock and weigh that against potential future income from leasing it to TOCs.  If the stock is only compatible with one line, the potential market is much smaller and thus the stock is likely a less valuable investment.

Because mandating pedestrians wear helmets and have licenses is stupid. Head injury afflicts drivers, but I haven't heard you demanding roll helmets.

You seem to want to shift the burden of responsibility to the vulnerable road users. That's great, but there isn't a safe place for people to learn how to become a safe cyclist in terms of road awareness. I've been shifting responsibility to design, for the most part at least.

&gt; that kid is to blame

He didn't choose for a busy road for a play ground. He didn't choose for all those parked cars to obscure visibility. You choose to see the kid as being faulty but not the location of parking a truck. That's indicative of the wider car hegemony—people get run over, tough.

&gt;  I said that cyclists are entirely responsible

Like I said to your white-knight, you chose to shift focus.

&gt; So assume away... but this bike riding, pavement walking, car driving - road crash victim is happy to suggest that everyone do their part to look after the safety of themselves and those around them on the roads. You continue to scorn that if you like - but you look a real berk doing it.

This sentiment is found in the Scottish Niceway Code initiative which has been shat on from a great height by any serious commuter cyclist. As a cyclist you're probably well aware of the scheme and the ridicule, no? Roads are unsafe, cars are unsafe so much so they want to enforce Automatic Emergency Braking systems to prevent another Sheppley Cross. Of course it wasn't the driver's fault it was the design!

My point is you are overstating the threat posed by the cyclist, over stating the agency a cyclist has regarding his own safety, and thus being an advocate of cyclists being responsible as a solution when it is largely impossible given current road designs.

I'm not sure if you've come across them, but ['Britrail Passes'](http://www.britrail.com/) are available to non-UK-residents and might be worth a look. They give open travel on railways (outside peak times, which isn't too much trouble because it affects relatively few commuter trains, mostly into London) for a set period (or N separate days). If you're on your own (or a pair) it can work out cheaper than a car.

listen to them both and compare them. proof is in the pudding. Besides its been speculated that this station was used as a numbers station by the british security forces for years (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincolnshire_Poacher_%28numbers_station%290). 

Location

Although the usage of numbers stations has not been confirmed by any world government, amateur enthusiasts have traced the location of the Lincolnshire Poacher's signal transmission to RAF Akrotiri, a Royal Air Force base located on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. The station is believed to be operated by the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) and maintained by the Royal Air Force members that occupy the base in Cyprus.

http://www.ukphoneinfo.com/search.php?GNG=01252+230607&amp;Submit=Submit&amp;d=nl the number is based in aldershot. although it was suggested it was a proxy number for a number that could be hosted anywhere.

typing in raf aldershot into google lead me to RAF Odiham. Given the near location and the fact that the Lincolnshire Poacher is most likely broadcast from RAF atokriti in cyprus. this is the most likely location of the phone number that links with the shortwave service.

the second call to the number in the follow on article find its out of action with the message.

""this channel is not available at this time please refer to back up channel romeo xray three nine (rx39). end.""

https://soundcloud.com/kernelmag/the-lincolnshire-poacher-is

Backup channel rx39 certainly seems to be a radio frequency adding more weight that this is indeed a legitimate secret raf phoneline and not a hoax.

Also in the follow up article the Kernal shows a screenshot of a text they received after calling the line stating ""This number is restricted please do not call 01252 230607 again."".

The Kernel, along with several of our readers, received a text message from a new number informing us that the “Lincolnshire Poacher” telephone number is restricted, asking us that we do not call it again. When we tried to call the new number that the text message was sent from, we were informed that the number was not recognised.

http://www.kernelmag.com/features/report/4947/did-we-take-out-mi6s-secret-line/

pretty concrete.

a backtrace on the number shows that the number is potentially valid and was registered to three. http://www.ukphoneinfo.com/search.php?GNG=07472041750&amp;Submit=Submit&amp;d=nl.

They have spent around ten years of working as party hacks and interns in addition to studying politics early on. They have often decided from the age of 16 that politics is what they want to do, and have tailored their entire lives round it.

Being a member of parliament is not an entitlement. Being a member of the House of Lords is not an entitlement (unless you are a hereditary, of course)

It is something that you have to put an insane amount of work, time, effort and expertise into for very little payoff before getting chosen as a candidate. Even then, most have to run multiple times and pray for a safe seat.

The vast majority of these candidates who are suited for the position, who have done the work, are qualified, and tick the boxes are rich white men. Hence politics is dominated, in each party, by rich, white men.

This is not racist and is to be expected, one should judge whether there is inbuilt bias by the percentage of rejected, qualified, black and ethnic or female candidates. For the conservatives, there are extremely few.

The question should not be whether there are Pakistani women in cabinet, it should be whether the interns, people studying PPE at Oxford, the rank and file who actually campaign accurately reflect modern Britain and how we go about changing that.

But, no. That is boring and doesn't get any focus. This is political discourse we're considering, actually trying to improve the nation through helpful dialogue would be insane, unheard of! Far better that we trump the one or two outliers who do make their way through irrespective of adversity and complain that Cameron doesn't get women when the only people he has to consider are incompetent (Claire Short, Warsi, Justine Greening) insane (Privy Patel)  or deceased (Mrs T) while ignoring the proper issues out there.",0,1378746649,null,0,1378751921,0,cc4vnjb,t3_1m1es2,t1_cc4vnjb,t3_1m1es2,null,1429536530,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

If Alstom were willing to build you the trains to fit our narrower loading gauge, it would require a lot of redesigning and re-engineering work, so you would probably end up paying twice as much for the trains.

You are trying to equivocate somebody not taking simple safety precautions like looking before crossing a road or wearing a bike helmet or indicating before you turn, with people (happens to men as well) who get raped because they didn't take safety precautions. It doesn't stand up because in the rape example it's an act committed with intent and malice and is deliberate, so really anything you or don't do will be beyond your control as a rape victim. Yes you can mitigate that by avoiding being on your own with somebody you don't know and other such strategies but that doesn't make you at fault because you don't do those things. The responsibility and fault would purely be that of the person committing the crime not the victim. 

Car accidents are just that, accidents, nobody intends to go out and run another person over and we all know there are risks to using the roads. If you don't take simple mitigation steps then you are accepting an increased risk of an accident (or consequences of an accident) by using the roads and really I don't think it's right to punish the driver unless they are in fact at fault and they did cause the accident through negligence. If a pedestrian or cyclist causes an accident by negligence then I find them to be just as much at fault. 

If you have a situation where the driver is clearly at fault but the pedestrian or cyclist increased the risks for themselves. For example a cyclist get's knocked over with no helmet in a slow speed collision but bashes head on the road and is seriously hurt then you have to say that they are both responsible to some degree, what that degree is would have to be decided by a court.

In this example the guy was not punished for knocking the girl over, he was punished for the actions he took prior to (sending texts while driving) and after the accident (deleting the evidence). It quite clearly says he wasn't at fault for the accident so therefore we have to infer that sadly the child in this case is responsible for stepping out in front of the truck.

After recently having an opportunity to enjoy an informal chat with Colin Baker at a private event, it's apparent The BBC is not taking them seriously at all. I don't mean in this protest, I mean, in general.

He said the thing the BBC fail to realise is that 5,6,7 &amp; 8 are all actually good friends in real life! So the BBC call them, and offer them an abysmal fee to appear at the 50th weekend. So they all talk, and turn it  down. A month later the BBC get back with another, less abysmal fee. So they all talk, and turn it down. The third time, another month later, they agree to do it, because this fee actually covers their expenses. I believe Paul also bailed on a way better paying job to do it, because Colin says they all love the show, but that doesn't mean they can do it for nothing.

Fast forward a few weeks. Colin was at an event with David Tennant. He asked David if he too had been approached by the Beeb to do the weekend, and from memory Colin (quoting David) said something like this:

""Yes, but only last week! There I am talking with Peter [Davison] and hearing you all get all these offers over the months, and I don't hear a peep! Then last week, I finally get the call, and they offer me the same bloody fee they offered you all in the first place! It's like they don't think Peter and I even talk! So I told them to stuff it!""

&gt;However. I like the idea the Premiership teams are absolutely the best that have ever been put together in the history of the world. Future generations might see our football games as some kind of high point they'll never have the resources to match.

I find the 'hyper-tuned edge' to be the thing that is an entire waste of everybodies everything.  The resource, time, man-power, money, effort and space that goes into making that merry-go-round keep on playing is biblical in proportion - and it's all for what?  ""The most high skilled game of football history will ever see"".  Well woopty-fucking-doo.  How about doing something worth while with all that effort?  People have and will enjoy all sorts of sports forever for the love of watching and playing.  There is nothing wrong with *doing it better*, but the point is, it has become completely absurd.  It's like spending 1000s of millions of pounds, acres and acres of land, months and years and decades of time - all in the pursuit of the biggest, greatest, and most perfect statue that ever will exist.  Would you think that was a cool idea - because 'people enjoy it'... or would you think - hang on, this statue is sort of big enough, and I think having *all* the sculptures in the world working on it is probably a bit much.  Maybe we could make it a bit smaller, and less 'perfect', and then we could also have some paintings n stuff dotted about.

No response not even to that? You really are victim blaming.

true,thafman,num23,,"There are 4 spots. 3 IMO are spoken for.

* City have improved massively and Pellegrini is no fool. For my money they have the best squad in the league.

* No chance that Utd. will drop out of the top 4, Moyes might take some time to fully adjust to the expectation of wining every game, but their squad will carry them to at least a top-3 finish.

* Chelsea are no longer the basket case they have been since they sacked Ancelotti. In Mourinho they have the best manager in the league and more world-class attacking mids than the rest of the prem put together. Last season we finished a mere 3 points behind them. I cannot see that happening again.

There are three teams competing for 4th:

* Last year after we beat them, the arse  went on a run of title wining form to sneak into 4th (the cunts). Now they have a settled squad in the 2nd year of the post Van-Persie era and Ozil can only improve them. Their depth issues get overstated but at least at striker if Giroud gets injured or loses form, they would have to fall back to Nicholas Bendtner which frankly would be hilarious.

* Liverpool for me are more of an attacking threat than anyone outside the top 3. Coutinho/Suarez/Sturridge is a wonderful front three and the whole team has started really well this year, I know you should never judge by three games, but beating United will have really energized the place.

* For us it will be all about if the squad can gel. On paper Lamela and Erickson could be as exciting as Reus and Götze, but might take a while to make it so. We have seven players who have never kicked a ball in English football before, this may be another transitional season.

In short its going to be really tough.

Water has been known to kill people by overdose and drowning, ban that as well? Or does utility come into your head at all?

As far as your question to me goes, pedestrians don't need to wear helmets because they don't actually fall over that often wheras cyclists fall off a lot more often and they have further to fall, at higher speeds. So it's really just a question about acceptable risk. I don't judge the risk to be great enough to walk around with a helmet as does nearly everybody. 

I agree that if cars and trucks can be designed better they should be, I don't even know why you are making that point. Cars are getting safer and better designed all the time. I would also agree that some people buy stupid cars that are more dangerous to pedestrians (bull bars on stupid 4x4's for example)

Your last paragraph there, I am not even opposed to, I agree cycle lanes are shite and traffic management could be a lot better.

It's pretty hard to ignore when your entire city centre is closed down for a day, and you get a bunch of yobs smashing windows under police escort. I guess the EDL have cleaned up their look in recent months, but both times I've seen them march personally in the two cities I frequent, the entire city was disrupted for a day and I was personally in a store when a window was smashed by an EDL guy. 

Plus if you do ignore them without a response it sends a message that Britain is not a place open for muslims or immigrations. This eventually seeps into politics, and you have asshats like Geert Wilders in Netherlands able to make a political platform out of it. I'd rather not have that.

true,crucible,null,null,"&gt; That's still not a problem in Spain, as they can and do change gauge mid-journey

Yes, but only the track gauge changes. From 1,435 mm Standard Gauge to 1,668mm Iberian Gauge (and vice-versa).

The loading gauge is the overall height and width of the train, and has little to do with the track gauge. See [this picture](http://beleben.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/network-rail-loading-gauges.png?w=499&amp;h=491) for example. The dark green ""W6"" is the most common loading gauge in use across the UK today. For a double-decker TGV type train you'd need the orange ""GC"" loading gauge.

For instance, I believe the railways of Ireland use similar loading gauges to the UK despite the track gauge being different at 1,600mm.

Anyway, HS2 will have to be built using commonly agreed EU standards, which I believe are currently:

* Electrified at 25,000 volts, using overhead wires

* Built to European loading gauge (I believe [""UIC B+"" specification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loading_gauge#Standard_loading_gauges_for_standard_track_gauge_lines))

* Built using Standard Gauge track (1,435mm / 4ft 8^1/2 inches)

* Top speed between 200 and 225 mph

* [European Train Control System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Train_Control_System) signalling

for all new high speed lines.

Just to clarify a couple things:

* OP is a troll. He's made 3 comments on /r/soccer and they're all complaining about Arsenal. If he was a regular user who was just bitching about a rival, that's cool but he hasn't contributed anything else, so his entire participation on /r/soccer is trolling.  

* He's also /u/Superluka and /u/TheRealNikoKranjcar trying to make a scene. He's made similar threads to this with both those accounts - lying in both, by the way. His first account was temporarily banned for making a series of bigoted statements - they're still in his comment history if anyone has the time and energy to take a look - he chose to [lie about it to you guys](http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1ki6dg/i_got_banned_from_rsoccer_for_this_comment/). His second account was banned for making more bigoted statements - again, still in his history - and [he chose to make a post lying about that as well](http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1lzdr3/be_careful_in_rsoccer/). 

Basically, he's a child and he thinks you're stupid enough to make his scene for him. If anyone who *isn't* one of his alts would like to clarify anything else, go ahead. 

**Update**  - I see SuperLuka is continuing to lie about not having his ban explained to him. From the modmail conversation after he was banned:

""http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/wiki/rules

parts 1, 2 and 3""

"" &gt;1 Follow Reddiquette

&gt;Everybody should read the page on Reddiquette since the rules apply in the soccer subreddit. The outline there is very simple and is not asking for much from users.

&gt;2 Do not flame or be aggressive

&gt;Don't call people names, flame them or be aggressive. Remain civil in discussions and debates and be respectful of others.

&gt;3 No racism, homophobia, or other offensive language

Very simple. It will be removed and repeat offenders will be banned.

that last line is the answer""

These were the **first two responses given to him** by mods. Yet, he claims it was because he compared Arsenal to MK Dons.  This guy is knowingly lying to you because he thinks you're all idiots. For all his ""We need to stick together, stop sucking up to the mods"" bullshit he's spewing here, he has no problems thinking the worst of the /r/coys community. As I've told him many times, he's an embarrassment.

It also includes this heartbreaking but beautiful passage.

&gt;One of the most influential figures in football history made his last public appearance while sitting in an armchair at home. It was 1982 and he was being interviewed by the BBC’s Sportsnight. In the last scene of a special programme made to mark the centenary of Tottenham Hotspur, Arthur Rowe, the manager who led the side to its first League title in 1951, was asked what the club meant to him. Rowe looks up, sets his jaw, then opens his mouth, then sets his jaw again. He is obviously struggling to contain his emotions. He tries once more to speak, but the words catch, his jaw quivers and he adjusts in his seat, his hand coming up to grip his chin as he attempts to regain the control he is losing. He succeeds and, his eyes coming up to look once more at his questioner, says simply: “I like them. They are a great club and to be associated with them…” – the words threaten to catch once more but he just manages to whisper them – “was nice”.",0,1378758664,null,0,false,0,cc507v7,t3_1m1j7z,t1_cc507v7,t3_1m1j7z,null,1429534401,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

true,nootashey,null,null,"I'm not talking about a situation where someone refuses an ambulance. I'm saying there are situations where the NHS refusing a midwife at a home birth could lead to a situation where a complication is spotted late enough that there could be a death.

To explain further...say a hospital has advised against a home birth. The woman starts birthing at home. Calls up labour ward. Labour ward encourage woman to come in. Woman refuses. Labour ward send out a midwife anyway. Midwife attends. Midwife spots a complication, she works with woman and persuades her to attend labour ward. Necessary action is taken in hospital and everything is fine.

In this situation if the NHS had refused a midwife the complication could have been missed initially and nothing spotted until the situation was very serious. At this stage an ambulance could be called but it could be too late.

That's what I mean when I'm  saying that the NHS would be on dodgy ground by refusing a midwife in such a situation.

I don't know if they would be wrong or right to absolutely refuse a midwife like that, especially considering that there could be an impact on other patients back at the hospital...but it's worth thinking about the consequences of sending or not sending a midwife.

I know our system is intended to create more opportunities for more players, and to put fewer of our fortunes in the hands of a single player, which is all well and good.  But the flip side of that is without a world-class magician like Bale, we don't really have anyone who can take the ball on their boots in the moments that matter most and find a way to put the ball in the net.  Moreover, even when it wasn't Bale doing the scoring, he was attracting so much attention from the defense that it freed up chances for others.  In his absence, at least thus far, we've looked pretty lost up front.  Just my opinion.

Again, I hope for all the world that I'm wrong and this campaign is the most successful in Spurs history, but the fact is we've played 270+ minutes of football this season and have yet to score in open play.

The EDL are not voicing an opinion, they are marching in order to intimidate, frighten and cajole.

The idea they represent is one of hate, control and fear.

It is in fact the duty of every person who considers themselves an equal member of the Human Race to show these people that not everyone is easily cowed by their brutish, evil methods.

It is the duty of each person to resist every attempt made by these people to assert power or show force, and if it is neccesary to use violence in the course of that resistance then we must.

As a member of the LGBT community, these people are actively advocating a policy of violence towards me. They want me to not exist. They want to kill me.

For example, a lot of the statistics quoted about the safety of home births are quite old.  But in an era when home births were strongly discouraged by doctors then only the extremely hard-core anti-traditional-medicine people would have them.  Which meant if there was a complication then these were the people who would completely refuse to go to a hospital, ever.  So that completely skewed the stats and made it look much more dangerous than it really would be for a reasonable person.

It's all very well James, saying that by pushing the articles down does not imply that you've been duped - but I can see no refutation of the actual claim that *the Kernelmag has been duped*.

Answer me this then, today you've retweeted all of last week's articles on Twitter, but you've been conspicuously silent about the two articles dealing with this ""We brought down an MI6 listening station"" story.

And the most ridiculous thing I've heard is that you have been publishing sensationalist articles on the subject of national security without proper evidence or attribution of source.

You haven't answered the question of why you published two major articles and seem to have provided no evidence or source. You've published without validated sources. This is highly unprofessional and you know are trying to cover yourself with statements on Twitter, claiming your ""source"" has gone ""batshit crazy"".

Is this how the Kernelmag does business now?

However. Let me be clear.

When is the Kernelmag and it's publishers going to retract these ridiculous fantasies?

If the EDL or any such groups as the BNP came into power, do you think you would be able to freely speak your opinions against them? No, it would be outlawed pretty fucking quick. History has repeatedly proven this multiple times just in the past 100 years.

People have their rights, as long as they do not follow them with violence against people who had no control over their arrival in life. Is it really okay for these people to go around beating the shit out of people or killing people (look at Greece)!  

Thing is, you sit comfortably with your life while other people are out there making people's lives hell because of one single factor, prejudice. If no one is out there to protect them, you might as well bring on outright Fascism. The police tend to be pretty shit at protecting against these attacks generally.

I'm sure there are arse holes in ANTIFA groups, but no more arse holes then any other group, the difference is, the ANTIFA are generally not kicking the shit out of people due to race, creed, sexuality or any other attribute the far right feels its self happy to oppress.

The same players have to play together a lot to develop understanding/ chemistry, but you can't leave top quality players on the bench for very long before they get impatient. The alternative is playing players out of position, Mata has never looked convincing on the right (where Jose has hinted he will start to play him), and Oscar is not as strong out wide either.

Strength in depth is a tricky problem. Look at our goalkeeping situation. We have two great keepers in Cech and Courtois, but it is going to be very awkward to accommodate both, and the end we will either edge out a club legend before his time, or loose one of the best young goalkeepers in Europe to another club which will play him regularly.

Granted, I don't have the numbers, but here's why: I'm not a professional. I don't have those numbers immediately to hand. I am a user of a website giving my interpretation based on my own interaction with people involved in the actual process. 

Now, I could always demand specific evidence on every single thing said on this subreddit, but my experiance has always been that if I spend hours researching the stuff and post it on here, it won't make the blindest bit of difference, some other joke 'dur toriez iz evil, am I right?' will get far higher votes and I'll end up having wasted hours trying to prove something that I know. Almost always, the demanding of evidence is more of an attempt to delegitimise what the purpose of the point is by someone who disagrees.

I also find it strange that you jump straight from demanding evidence to making a massive assertion that the people still in charge of choosing candidates are all local, old and men. These are the extreme, extreme minority and are usually outvoted by committees. 

In fact often when local authorities have been put in charge of the situation through systems like primaries you are even more likely to get female candidates, see Nadine Dorries, the Doctor lady and the like.

This is basically a Daily Mail reader's wet-dream, but none of them have a realistic possibility of becoming law! 

Many, if not all, of the above bills are up for second reading in the coming weeks - I wonder how many more pointless submissions about them will appear on this subreddit.

true,IAMA_dragon-AMA,smith,Smith,"&gt;How do you feel about your race being defamed in nearly every portrayal?

Most people think we're fictional, and those that don't tend to think that we're easily dispatched by shouting some syllables and faffing about with a sword. I like those guys; they're like delivery dinners.

&gt;How cool is Dragonvale, and more importantly, how cool is Dragontales? Is Puff a stoner who got that nick name when he dropped out of college?

Fictional, fictional, and... fictional.

&gt;How old are you?

Roughly 250. I can't remember minor (to me at least) events with much clarity, though.

&gt;Why do you pick on every adventurer in every DnD campaign?

1. Usually, they're the ones that pick fights with dragons, not the other way 'round.
2. Because they're crunchy and taste good with or without ketchup; plus their equipment tends to be quite valuable for trading.
3. If your DM is only giving you dungeons with dragons as the final boss, he needs to get some new material. Seriously, use a Lich King or a Vampire, or have it be a surprise attack from a bunch of ""statues."" ^(^^Don't ^^blink)

&gt;Have you ever considered calling BBC and asking for a role in Dr. Who?

Oh, that would be an absolute *nightmare.* First off, I tend to distrust cameras, since they bypass the aura of disbelief most humans generate around me (like the TARDIS' perception filter, but client-side rather than server-side). Secondly, it would be irrefutable evidence of the existence of dragons, which would cause civil and/or political panic *everywhere.* And third, of course, there's a very low chance that I'd be in a good episode, at least until 12's established his character well and we know for sure he's got a good writer behind him.

true,nootashey,null,null,"Come on, sending out a member of staff to plead with an individual to stop smoking is not comparable to sending out a midwife to the home of a mother birthing at home against medical advice.

They are so different you have in fact rather lost me on the point you are trying to make.

No the NHS is not responsible for someone's poor decision making. So if there was a death at a home birth attended by a midwife which was against medical advice, then the NHS should not be held responsible. But to extend that further and say that that the NHS should refuse to attend a woman birthing at home against medical advice......I think it's a difficult decision..and much less clear cut then people here want to admit. By not attending they further increase the risk to mother and baby. Using your own analogy I'd say refusing to attend is more akin to refusing COPD treatment - it is certainly not the equivalent of not sending someone to plead with a patient about cigarettes as I've already said.",0,1378770960,null,0,false,0,cc54ru3,t3_1m1rf2,t1_cc54ru3,t1_cc54fe4,null,1429532264,-11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-11

true,fragglemook,null,null,"I am not a lawyer. But I do have experience.  This is a job offer letter that you use to get the work permit in advance.  It is not a contract.  Contracts must have full disclosure.  Since it says ""the full contract will be given to you""....etc. this means there has been no full disclosure.

No contract, no obligation.  

But the government/immigration will view this as an **implicit** contract so as to facilitate administration and they will view the letter and your actions as supporting evidence.

Therefore, you must be seen to honour the terms you have agreed in the letter in order for the government to allow you to remain in country.  This means your intent must be to fulfil the agreement outlined in that letter when you enter the country.  If you decide to change jobs after you're in, that's your business as long as you have the correct visa.

One letter of offer and a granted visa can get you in the country.  If you decide to quit the first job early and have an offer of contract with another company after you enter the country, then that is your business, just as long as you keep immigration posted and apply for the appropriate visa when you take your second job.

Always make sure you abide by the letter of your visa.  Read and understand the terms of it and you should be fine.  

Immigration just want you to be there legally.  I'm sure they couldn't give a toss about who you work for as long as they're legit.

From experience, I would always have money ready to leave the country at short notice to apply for a visa to get back in the country because sometimes immigration want you to get out of the country for a month or two so it doesn't look like you're abusing holiday visas etc.  E.g. money for a backpacking holiday in Europe, France, Germany etc.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; Fair enough, but how far does that extend?

I disagree somewhat with /u/DogBotherer, in that I would say that property is a social construct which the state manages on our behalf.

It is not the state that ""created"" the idea of property - just as kids argue in the playground about who owns the ball or the stick they found, we as humans like to have the security of knowing that no-one can deprive us of our home or our possessions.

We can see [who is holding the book](http://i.imgur.com/hE6vgAJ.jpg), but we don't know who *owns* it. If we want to know the colour or the weight of the book then we can measure that, but the *ownership* of the book is determined only by knowing its history. 

We all tend to talk about property as if we know what it is, but I think our understanding of the concept, for most people, is that we squabbled with the other kids in primary school and the teacher said ""play nice, that belongs to Sandra"". 

I think that a deeper kind of understanding of property is necessary if you're to hold meaningful opinions on things like politics and justice. I think that most of us take ""what we know"" for granted, and don't really think about it very deeply.

I think, in particular, that we need to ask where property comes from, and that this kind of assessment challenges many mainstream political opinions.

Again I differ from /u/DogBotherer in that I think he makes a distinction between ""private"" property and ""personal"" property, where I am not inclined to do so. I think we tend to agree in saying that the world's natural resources, and the fruits of them, should be distributed more equitably.

No. CT's sonic costs that much for a reason, it's extremely difficult and time consuming to machine an exact replica with the complicated finish that the Sonic has.

Now, you did ask for an inbetween option, the only one available isn't available yet, it has a release date of October and it's [this](http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/13a8/). 

Universal remote, extends but like the Matt Smith universal remote it'll be plastic with a metal paint finish. It'll look better than the CO toy though.

Then again, if it's for one evening, don't break your bank, nobody at the party or whatever will care if you have the CO version, if you plan to Cosplay Ten again and do conventions I'd recommend breaking the bank and getting the CT, nothing beats it.

There are few common condiments that aren't free in a restaurant.  You wouldn't expect to walk into a McDonald's and pay for ketchup or salt.  Nor would you walk into a Taco Bell and expect to pay for taco sauce, whether or not you fancy mild, medium, hot, or fire sauce.  

Here we consider it customer service.  Especially when you consider the fact that the predominant call on in Edinburgh is for the brown and salty.  That chippy has to spend more money to service those customers because they're more likely to use more than necessary.  Handing over a customer on a rare occasion a few packets/sachets of ketchup seems like a small expense compared to the thousands of customers eating up his/her profits in grotesque amounts of the brown and salty.

To nickel and dime certain customers because of their preference seems a bit off.

I guess this can be seen in two ways. If births are now done by NHS hospital trusts and there's a minimal amount of people wanting home births, doesn't the low demand make it more possible to get to these few people?

true,Adinnieken,null,null,"Well, I seem to remember the English giving Scottish clan leaders ownership of the clan lands.  Thus allowing clan leaders to be land barons and kick the tenant farmers off the fertile lands they farmed and lived off of.  So those same said land barons could herd sheep, and the best that the former tenant farmers could raise on the lands they got in return were potatoes.  

So, damn right you can blame Westminster.  Maybe not the current government, but all the shit that has taken place over the centuries, sure.

Do you know in the 1970's there was a report was commissioned to determine whether or not Scotland could survive on it's own with the then discovered oil in the North Sea.  It was Labour and Conservatives that agreed to quietly keep that report silent because it said Scotland could very easily survive independently. 

If that wasn't a big enough slap in the face, only years later you had the Thatcher government closing down coal and steal mines, as well as ship yards without any consideration for the people that worked there.  There was no attempt to bring new labour sources into Scotland to replace the lost work.  

Who did that?  Was that no Westminster or am I so pissed that I'm no thinkin' straight?  Considering I'm dry, I don't think I'm so drunk I don't know what I'm talking about.  Thatcher was PM of the UK, and it was her government that systematically destroyed heavy industry in Scotland leaving thousands upon thousands unemployed, collecting pensions and eating chips.

Now I'm all for Scotland taking responsibility for itself.  Like ANY grown adult who sits there and blames his/her parents for how they were raised, that's all fine and dandy.  But at least for an adult they can set out on their own and take charge of their own life.  Scotland can't.  Scotland is constantly under the thumb of Westminster.  They're like an adult that wants to move out, wants to set out on their own, but the parent won't let them.  The parent keeps saying, ""I know what's best for you."" but nothing that parent does is actually beneficial to that adult child.  It only ever benefits the parent.  No matter what, that fucking parent always ensures it benefits them.

But you were saying how Scots should take more responsibility for themselves.  Doesn't that start with Independence? ",0,1378780362,null,0,false,0,cc58h7z,t3_1l498i,t1_cc58h7z,t1_cbw7sxb,null,1429530535,0,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,0
