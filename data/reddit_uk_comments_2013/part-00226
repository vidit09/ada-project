If their government can openly abuse the constitution and get away with it then the country is left with only one option: anarchy.

Both could work, and that way we have out *best players* out on the field, but I'm just not sure it would make the best team.  For example, Moses would probably suit as well as Henderson out wide.  

Not dropping Henderson and keeping the 3-5-2 will be very hard.  A suggestion above, which I liked, was to put Johnson on the left and Henderson on the right WB positions.  But, then, if Enrique is fit, the same problem re-arises.  

I just don't think we have the correct players for a balanced 4-4-2 at the mo.  Diamond perhaps, but as Rodgers has never really played either, and system-wise favours lots of width, it's a tricky one to call all round, but it seems unlikely he'd go that way.  Again, more likely Suarez in the hole, with 4-2-3-1, but he has said that he feels this doesn't best utilise both SAS (which, on recent evidence, is a point well backed up) - he prefers them both to play as ""9^1/2's"".

If I had to choose, I'd go for 3-5-1-2, with Hendo at RWB and Johnson at LWB, with Coutinho in the Coutinho-shaped-hole in midfield.

[We do not support the ""normalization"" or decriminalization of any form of sexual relations between adults and children. Such behavior must remain criminal and punishable to the full extent of the law.](http://web.archive.org/web/19991010055703/http://www.apa.org/releases/delay.html)
Straight from the horses mouth, as they'd say.

The APA recognizes child-adult sexual interaction as abuse. 

Here's a tiny portion of the hell child abuse causes.

[Results: Youth with sexual abuse histories were more often female, had higher rates of social chaos and associated physical abuse and neglect, and had higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance abuse disorders. Chronically abused subjects came from the most chaotic and abusive backgrounds; were younger when first abused; had the highest number of abusers; were more likely to have been molested; and were more often abused by their father/stepfather and/or their mother/stepmother. Using logistic regression analyses, sexual abuse histories were predicted by sexually inappropriate behaviors, symptoms of PTSD and borderline personality disorders, dissociative symptoms, substance abuse and animal cruelty.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/014521349500087O) They compared non-abused to isolated events, intermittent abuse, and chronic.




[After controlling for background characteristics identified as risk factors for both child sexual abuse and depression, severity of child sexual abuse was significantly related to depressive symptoms only for non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans. Child sexual abuse variables accounted for more variance in depression than background variables only for Mexican American women. **Child physical abuse was the strongest predictor of adult depression and the only significant predictor for each ethnic group.**](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/10197407/)

[A particularly strong association between early sexual abuse and co-morbid depression/anxiety was found.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/12577276/)

[ Self-reported CSA-Child Sexual Abuse was associated with **increased risk for adverse outcomes**&lt;alcohol use, social skills problems, etc&gt;, controlling for family background. Family background risk factors also were associated with adverse outcome risk. Discordant pair analysis seems to provide an effective means of controlling for family background risk factors.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/11825135/)


[In the sample as a whole, those reporting CSA were more likely to receive lifetime diagnoses of **major depression, conduct disorder, panic disorder and alcoholism**, and were more likely to report **suicidal ideation and a history of suicide attempt**. Abused women, but not men, were also more likely to report **social phobia. **](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/10722174/)

[. Interviews with the nonoffending parents found that 76% of the children were thought to be less confident than before, 30% had fewer friends, and 20% were more aggressive. Increased sexual awareness was noted in 24%. School teachers reported that 28% still had behavior problems, 17% had repeated a year at school, and a further 17% had deteriorated in their school work. The sexually abused girls had significantly lower self-esteem than the control girls. ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/3676894/)

[Results indicated that the majority of children (71%) were abused 4 or fewer times. In addition, genital manipulation and/or fondling was the most common form of abuse. In 82% of the cases, there were no marital separations or family breakups of any kind within six months before or six months after the abuse. Many children (69%) displayed psychological symptoms. The most frequent were **nightmares, bedwetting, clinging behavior, inappropriate sexual behavior, anxiety and sadness**](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/3955424/)

[ **A 35% rise in behavioral symptomatology was noted for the sexually abused children following the onset of their abuse.** Forty-nine percent of the abused children showed no evident sign of emotional or mental trauma on pediatric examination. However,**the longer the duration of abuse, the greater the likelihood of negative effects in the form of emotional and behavioral trauma and school problems in the child victims.** When the children were forced into adult, and perhaps intimate pseudo-romantic behavior, e.g., passionate kissing and vulvar or vaginal intercourse, the more likely a manifest problem would appear. Violence, in this study, played a minor role in predicting behavior problems. Implications for prevention of child abuse are discussed.](http://m.sax.sagepub.com/content/2/1/29)

[Abused participants reported twice as many subsequent rapes or sexual assaults (p = .07), 1.6 times as many physical affronts including domestic violence (p = .01), almost four times as many incidences of self-inflicted harm (p = .002), and more than 20% more subsequent, significant lifetime traumas (p = .04) than did comparison participants. Sexual revictimization was positively correlated with posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSD), peritraumatic dissociation, and sexual preoccupation. Physical revictimization was positively correlated with PTSD symptoms, pathological dissociation, and sexually permissive attitudes. Self-harm was positively correlated with both peritraumatic and pathological dissociation. Competing theoretical explanations for revictimization and self-harm are discussed and evaluated.](http://m.jiv.sagepub.com/content/18/12/1452)



There's TONS more, I mean MOUNTAINS more. Most of the studies compare non CSA victims to CSA victims. So they have a bit of control group. They also try to work with matching family histories (adjusting for: divorce, drug abuse in the family etc) basically other factors that could influence their results.

Because they are more accessible than physics, mathematics, music etc., and because they are a hybrid of subjective and objective truth, people think that things are easy or obvious, and don't show them the respect of actually working hard to acquire a sound knowledge. Brand clearly hasn't done the legwork, he only knows enough to be dangerously ignorant by being generally aware of the current malaise and major issues, rather than harmlessly ignorant by being entirely oblivious. Unfortunately too, as he is a very successful and famous guy, he seems to have confused media proficiency with knowing what he's on about when it comes to politics and society.

But yeah, what marks this out as so fucking dumb is that he is influential. The platform he gets given, with interviews like this, plus his habit of regurgitating thesauruses at will, makes people that trust and like him (a huge sweep of the country) think he has the answers. The thing is that it isn't Russell Brand that will be the real danger, but what he's doing is bringing ideas and 'paradigms' (his new buzzword) into the mainstream that rightly were seen as puerile and beyond the pail because of the events of the last century- and even relates to what is currently happening across the arab world. But what he's done is he's now laying the ground for people far more active in their ignorance than him, and far more unpleasant of character, to advance their arguments. The current system has problems, but now, rather than people looking to use their stake in a democratic system, morons will think that a non-democratic solution is worthy of discussion because of a jumped-up comedian who confuses fame with virtue. If he just said this amongst mates, nobody would give much of s hit, if he said it on one of his shows people would be fucked off, doing it being interviewed by Newsnight's Paxman was always going to produce a genuine shitstorm.",0,1382832620,null,0,false,0,cd0bcq4,t3_1p9tb9,t1_cd0bcq4,t1_cd0b2qi,null,1428972250,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"See I disagree with your analysis.  Western developed economies are being hollowed out by corporations decamping to the developing world and globalised finance, all of which happens at a level above the power of individual States to resist.  Multinationals no longer really even need access to our individual markets, because there are markets developing which will dwarf ours.  Overlay this with climate change and energy issues, and our likely future is a continued and increasingly painful long drawn out descent.

So coming back to your point on the grinding poverty in India and the lack of revolutionary fervour there - firstly, there is radical dissent, horribly violent dissent, remember [this](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-20849295)?  Secondly, it's the very fact it _is_ enduring and unremitting poverty, arguably even a modest improvement over life before, as a measly amount of the BRIC growth trickles down to those at the bottom, means that the pain is less sharp.  However, undoubtedly countries everywhere with growing inequality will start to lose social cohesion and stability, especially in the context of climate change and exhaustion of energy and resources.  

But, the key point is that our scenario in the West is quite different.  We have made many major and substantive gains for working people over the decades and centuries by concerted dissident action and political pressure, but now we stand to lose many if not all of them in this process of hollowing out.  Western taxpayers have subsidised corporate globalisation and provided the resources - legal, military and financial - for the preparing of a fertile substrate in the developing world which transnationals can exploit, and the thanks we get is capital flight and desertion by those we subsidised to more attractive, higher profit growth economies, whilst we are left to stagnate and ultimately implode.

The human fact, backed up by the full weight of social science research, is that it hurts more to lose something than never to have had it - it may be _better_ to have loved and lost than never to have loved, but it sure as hell doesn't feel like it at the time.

You seem to be on the right track and it's the position of the YES side that the money Scotland contributes into the 'pot' is more than is returned via the Westminster budget (The yearly block grant).

The UK 'pot' has had a lot of things to pay for recently which Scots generally are not interested in contributing towards, such as invading Iraq, Afghanistan and maintaining Europe's largest Nuclear arsenal. 

Therefore, rather than contributing towards a pot that pays for lots of things Scots don't want, Scots raise and keep their own cash and raise/lower taxes appropriate to the needs of 5.2 million people, rather than allow a country of 63 million people to decide whats best for everyone. 

My argument is that Scotland will benefit from keeping extra money that Scotland raises right now and also saves a shitload by not being forced to contribute to UK SuperPower fantasies.",0,1382834871,null,0,false,0,cd0c33l,t3_1oxj0k,t1_cd0c33l,t1_ccxs49x,null,1428971908,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

true,TheSunsArchitect,lfc68,,"A diamond is viable, offensively, largely because of attacking fullbacks. 

The attacking ""in possession"" formation would actually end up looking something like this: http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=1l84 

As it is a very central driven formation, the width comes almost entirely from the fullbacks, and it most certainly would for large parts of the game against Arsenal, because the battle will be fought in the centre of the park, with both sides being possession based. 

It would require us to defend very tight, very narrow, as we would leave massive holes through the middle. Luckily, our team today, utilised the heavy press to their advantage. Against Arsenal, however, it's another story.

- River: interesting idea, having the Doctor interact/fall in love with another time traveler, and the out-of-sequence angle was also cool. But now it really seems like we've hit all of the important beats in their relationship save one [(the screwdriver)](/spoiler), so any additional stories with her apart from that one are just padding until her story is completed. Kinda makes me wish [Twelve gets a new screwdriver when he comes in...](/spoiler)

- The Angels: scary as hell in *Blink* the first time I watched it, but the fear is lost once we actually see them move later on. And *Angels Take Manhattan*... Really? [Statue of Liberty play](/spoiler)? Really?

- The Crack: Actually, I kind of like the idea that time and space can ""break"" like that, but the way the conclusion of that series was handled rather hurriedly. Anyone could've predicted what was in The Pandorica, and *so much deus ex machina* Although I suppose that's the point...

- The Silence: interesting enemy, but their importance has been teased at for far too long. They keep hinting at it without ever explaining why.

- The Doctor's Death: ...I got nothing on this one. I cannot explain anything that happened in Series 6.

- Clara: Oooookay, so she's the Impossible Girl because [she's seen every form of the Doctor, but only Matt Smith listened](/spoiler)? And this makes a difference... why? Plus the way they kept putting emphasis on ""OOH, SHE'S THE IMPOSSIBLE GIRL, WHY IS SHE IMPOSSIBLE, I NEED TO KNOW BUT YOU WON'T FIND OUT UNTIL THE FINALE!"" Really annoying.

It seems more like the Time Lords had access to technology that could artificially overcome the regeneration limit. They also had access to technology that could help them steal regenerations from other Time Lords. But maybe Moffat will have some new explanation to override everything. Who knows?

Also, with point 2: who even knows what's up with the Master's current body? I wonder whether they'll get around to explaining which body he's on. Prior to the new series, he had developed a habit of nicking other people's bodies.

Hendo gets all the plaudits, but Lucas is actually a great runner. Plenty of times this game and in the past where you see him charging across the field to help the fullback. Every time he goes on a sprint, it almost ALWAYS ends with him winning the challenge. He's like a homing missile. 

Steven is our captain, but everytime I watch a game it feels like Lucas is our general. He brings with him so much composure and tactically he's always on point. Watching him off the ball today was brilliant. He opens up passing lanes with his runs. Even when hes not on the ball, he is directing the play. IMO he's our maestro in the midfield.

true,sacredstones,null,null,"Agger in as DM over Lucas? Why? I think thats a bit drastic. Even though I love Allen and I think he'll be a huge component of the team in the future, I think we'd be fools not to play Henderson. It'd be a big ask of Allen to come back against Arsenal where he'll have to do a lot of running against the creative likes of cazorla, ozil, ramsey, and wilshere. 


As for our backline this is a huge headache..3 or 4. Today I was hoping that we'd go back to a 4, sort of as a practice run so that we could use 4 against arsenal. But now that the game is up, I think its too risky to switch from our current formation. It'll be tough because Kosclieny is a great reader of the game and is quick to cut out counters, but If we play 2 up front we'll have someone to take advantage of the BFG's lack of pace. 


I think we'll field a very similar team to the one today. I kind of doubt that Coutinho will start. Henderson had a great game..but he's still yet to shine in high pressure games. Arsenal are definitely gonna press the ball hard, so hopefully he can keep up his current confidence. I say start Hendo and bring coutinho in as a Sub when arsenals midfield is tired.

You haven't actually countered my point though, that is that Torres has never been and (again in my opinion, I'd love to be proved wrong) the same player after the string of injuries he suffered whilst playing for Liverpool and the Spanish National team.

It is my opinion that we never should have bought him when we did, he wasn't on great form, it was the wrong time of year and he appeared to be moving to us for the wrong reasons. It's my opinion now that we should get shot of him if we can, to be fair, right now I'd be happy to get rid of all of our strikers apart from Lukaku. None of them (in my opinion) are that great, none of them are cutting it in the top flight shall we say. Of course Eto still has time, but anything other than a squad/impact player... I'm not so sure.

It is also my opinion that Torres will never be considered a Chelsea Hero, for all his hard work on the pitch (look i don't hate him and appreciate many elements of his game) When I watch him play I don't see a player who loves the club he plays for. I see a player who wants a crack at fluking the golden boot again. He's no Drogba, Haisselbank or Zola. He's just a good footballer who's not as good at scoring goals as he used to be.

I was responding to an post entitled ""Torres has suffered critisism, now give him praise"" I still don't think he's done enough to warrant that praise as a striker (not a footballer, he's a good footballer), which is what we paid £50mil for him to be, to score goals to win us major competitions

No. Funding for graduates is INCREDIBLY competitive in the UK, even just for tuition fees let alone any other costs. Funding at Oxford IS more common, due to the amount of cash it has, and the tier of students, who are able to attract outside funding.

But even then I believe it only a bit less than 50%of graduates who have any kind of financial support. If we remove the taught masters students from the mix and count only PhDs, that will rise noticeably, but still leave lots of people out.

He's got YNWA tattooed on his knuckles! He's the vice captain! Why isn't he playing?"" I'd rather Sakho right now. The set up we have makes sense. Toure and Sakho are both comfortable on the ball and can bring it out. Skrtel is there purely as a defender. The box is his fucking castle. We're basically deciding between Agger and Sakho, and I'd choose Sakho. He's faster, better in the air, and generally more aggressive. It's a shame Agger is benched but that's the way it is sometimes. He might end up leaving but it's not like we'd be left in the lurch. Sakho is only 23 and only going to improve. Right now we are winning and the only way Agger will come back is if we start losing or Sakho fucks up.

I think one thing that we are lacking for games like this is youngsters at the right stage in their career. We can have the likes of O'Neil, Henry, Barton and Kranjcar doing a professional job, but we have nothing like Ings, Vokes and Trippier to call upon. Even Austin and Phillips are here on a kind of second step of progression in the game. No-one can question the importance of rolling up your sleeves and doing a job, but for games like this, and it should have been a big one, some cliché fire and passion would come in handy.

The passing routine is frustrating if it isn't creating chances. We had 61% of the possession but only 6 shots. I think we needed someone extra running into the box to support our attacking. Hoilett is no longer inspiring confidence down the wing. I think it's time to give Phillips the chance to show he's up to his price tag, with SWP getting a shot down the other side. Harry's seeming devotion to Jenas is reminding me of Bosingwa's constant selection last year.

true,Lilday,England,[Red XJ6N],"I've had the bike for 7 months now and done 10,500 miles.

Note that mine is restricted to 33bhp by the throttle, so your experience will probably be better than mine regardless.

For the first...I'd say 2000-3000 miles I got really bored with the bike, I mean I came from a sporty 125 so the seating (which is very comfortable) didn't feel right, and I thought the gear box was very clunky (I don't know if you've noticed on your learner bike).

However, after getting used to the bike and throwing some cash into mods (Most importantly an exhaust and HEL braided hoses - Both of these are a must on any bike IMO) it has definitely grown on me, and I can see myself keeping it until Spring 2015+ easily. I just have no reason to upgrade.

It is great on the commute (My old job was 80 miles per day, now I'm only doing 10 a day) and it has done great in both. Never let me down once.

Now that I've had time to sit with the bike and enjoy it, I really would recommend it to anybody. I've been out into North Wales at least 20 times on it easily putting out 300+ mile rides and it has been great. I'll try and get some videos up. Even with the 33bhp restrictor I can stay with my friends on ZX10/GSXR1000 etc. Of course, they can fly away if they want to...but we are on public roads...there is no reason to progress more than we do without becoming dangerous.

So yeah, great bike. I've posted a build thread on this forum (The american version of the bike is the FZ6R):

true,battlesmurf,,do it for redders 24/7,"Fair bit to take out of this game really. On the positive side Blackstock has had a great start to his time here and will be confident and hopefully score some more goals, Smith's confidence must be at an all time high 3 goals in 2 games is just great. [As well as this amazing build up play](http://i.imgflip.com/4f865.gif). I don't really see the game that negatively to be honest, a few players underperformed but we easily could've won it with Murphy's miss and Tom Lees getting an owned goal, I mean these are hardly issues that will continue to haunt us throughout the season. I see it more as a loss from 2 individual mistakes rather than some large issue that needs to be fixed. Plus we were playing away in a derby which we usually do pretty shit in anyway. I guess I can now see why McDermott brought in Zaliukas and I think it could be a good idea to put him in next week, although I'm not sure who he'd replace, perhaps Lees? Although I didn't really pay too much attention to which of our backs wasn't performing amazingly.

I'm also wondering how Blackstock fits into this, from what I heard from a Forest fan he's the kind of striker that needs good service to score goals, which I can see coming from Ross (or Austin I guess), but this would mean taking Ross out of the front 2 and perhaps putting him in Austin's attacking midfield position (assuming we keep the 3-5-2). I think Smith has earned his place up top so I don't think he should be moved around. I think if Blackstock is started against Yeovil we will have the same setup as we did when he came on for Murphy. 

I can see us having a formation like this for Yeovil. It would mean dropping Murphy and moving Austin into his position with Ross being the sort of play maker behind the 2 forwards.

true,chilari,eng-shropshire,Shropshire,"There is large scale redevelopment and house-building going on in London, but it's concentrated in large sites that used to be industrial or even scrubland. Look at King's Cross - 67 acres of new build over ten years, some of which is open like Saxon Court and Rubicon Court, some of it ongoing like the office buildings closer to the station and some not begun, like the residential buildings that are planned for the inside of those gas starage towers. There is stuff being built. But it's on sites like this one - large sites where everything is brand new, build ona long timetable.

Perhaps some streets, though, could benefit from smaller projects like that. The problems, though, are numerous - they'd be very expensive, partly because of the cost to compulsory-evict residents, some of whom will own their houses; then you'd got to produce a design that is sympathetic to the area, and not too much taller than the surrounding buildings, or you'd get objections from the local planning authority. Then of course is building something on a city-centre site with residential neighbours - never fun, and certainly not easy for a contractor to maintain a good relationship with residents, which is important to their reputation. Plus there's the affordable housing subsidy - required by the government if you're not building ""affordable"" homes in the first place, to enable them elsewhere.

And then there's the problem of the housing market. In three years time when this project is complete, the housing market may have fallen so much that sales of the properties doesn't cover the cost of buying the land, demolishing existing houses and building the new flats. Any developer seeking to enact a project like this is going to be wary of the risk of losing literally tens of millions of pounds if the housing market has dipped by the time they finish. Plus, even if the housing market hasn't dipped witht his project, by the time thirty developers have each done this at three or four sites each, increasing housing provision by 40% or 70% or whatever at each location, simply because there's less pressure on housing, housing prices will fall - so their first project might be in profit but by the time we get to project number 5, started 2 years later, things might not look as good for them. They'd literally be undermining their own market if they build too quickly. And while they're building, the house prices on that street drop a little to account for the ongoing construction work and its disruptive nature - the noise, the delivery trucks, the dust, etc - which might hang around a bit after the project is complete.

From a developer's point of view, small scale projects in residential areas aren't profitable. But large scale projects on huge abandoned industrial sites, where there's nothing there to begin with but a bunch of old buildings ready to fall apart and a lot of wild plants and discarded shopping trolleys, there there could be profit.",0,1382874901,null,0,false,0,cd0knn0,t3_1pb2qr,t1_cd0knn0,t1_cd0kefb,null,1428967880,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

Any over or under estimation of your usage can easily be rectified by submitting accurate meter readings. You should ALWAYS make sure you take a note of readings when you move in or out of a property and submit them to your supplier. Most problems occur when people don't inform the supplier of changes.

As soon as a supplier has an accurate reading they can't be overcharging you so if you get an estimated bill but your next bill is based on a real meter reading then you haven't overpaid.

Energy companies are only legally required to read your meter every 2 years but most will attempt readings every 6 months and they all allow you to submit your own readings.

If I'm honest, I think RVP is a more effective player and Rooney is a more all round forward.  Hell, I think Negredo seems to be a more effective player from his time in a blue shirt so far.

Aguero's worth doesn't really lie in how many goals he scores per game, nor how good his heading is; it lies in the fact that he has a quality that only a tiny amount of people have, he knows how to wear the shirt, to nick an old saying.

Yaya is the opposite.  He's an excellent technical player who is mainly a total flake.

Aguero is a player that has enough technical skill and intelligence to make him an excellent footballer but has become a footballer approaching world class because of their mentality.

Football isn't really about how well you play away at Chelsea or in the World Cup Final.  The motivation there is self-evident, it's a massive game and it's a worldwide event.  

Having the motivation to pick yourself up and keep gambling to the final whistle when you're away at West Brom is an entirely different skill, and one that City do not possess enough of.  We're a team of superstars and players who are approaching that world class bracket though who struggle to be motivated for 75% of that games, and that is absolutely criminal for any professional team let alone one of City's ambitions.

You could argue that Aguero misses too many chances and you would probably have a point, but the number of chances that he creates doesn't diminish as the game goes on or the result seems distant.  He's constantly alert and buzzing around no matter what events are happening on the field around him.

Whoever is in front of Sandro can attack with confidence knowing that he is behind them to mop up any counter. And if Sandro attacks, than the other player pivots and stays behind to take his position. It worked incredibly well last season with him and Dembele. And it's looked just as good with him and Paulinho. 

Sandro and Paul to start. Dembele for rotation with Paul throughout the season depending on the tactical/injury needs.

Given how few mortgage providers have signed up to it, the fact you can get 95% mortgages right now without any government intervention.  I think its pointless.

But I think it is more about political gaming.  The quote about americans considering themselves *temporarily embarrassed millionaires* springs to mind.

Young voters, you are just a temporarily non-homing, honest!

Everyone talks about prices, whilst ignoring demand and supply.  Demand in London is huge, I moved here after uni for work, and frankly I can't get half as good as lifestyle in any other town.  Now I am running my own company and we are considering where to be based, it again is coming back to London, or maybe perhaps Hong Kong (which also has insane housing problems).

Quite frankly we could have a nice office in Bristol and all that, but there simply isn't the easy supply of talent.  I don't care that I have to pay £80k to get a decent programmer, because I can get one tomorrow, the fact we've got the ability to have face to face chats with our clients, taking only 30 mins from the office.  Or 1 hour to LHR.  The difference between a 2.5 hour journey to have a meeting and a 5 hour journey is big, sure you could fly to Paris maybe at a time convenient from bristol, but its not quite every 30min.

So we're left with a place which attracts companies and people, but we don't build out thanks to green belt, we don't build up thanks to planning rules and lack of key infrastructure support (ie power n sewage).

true,ksturgis,null,null,"Honestly, this is the first time you have actually made the effort to make an intelligent, thought out post. To be honest, I don't harshly disagree with a single point you make. 

I completely agree that the decision to purchase Torres was simply irresponsible. It's clear that Torres was a prized striker that Roman had his eye on for a long time, and was never going to let him get away. I agree that the writing was on the wall long before Torres put on the blue shirt. His biggest strengths (speed, quickness, instinct) were quickly fading and the evidence can be seen even in his Liverpool days. 

But I **never** attempted to suggest that Torres is, or even could be considered a Chelsea hero. His contributions to the club pale in comparison to true club legends like Tambling, Wise, Zola, Dixon, RDM, Drogba etc. I don't think anyone would even attempt to suggest Torres' name belongs on that kind of list. 

I can even agree that with Lukaku on loan, our current options at striker are underwhelming to say the least. I don't know if I'd go as far as to say that cutting ties with all sans Lukaku would be wise given the fact that it would leave us with one striker who still lacks proper experience at a top club. That said, I do think the only striker *worth* hanging on to between Ba, Torres and Eto'o is (in my opinion) Torres without a doubt, because he has more to offer than either Ba or Sammy. 

I think the only subject we seem to disagree on is the original post, and whether or not Torres deserves any praise. As I've stated before, Torres has never deserved the vitriolic criticism he's received during his worst moments, nor has he deserved the glowing accolades many supporters have thrown at him when he's done some of the things he's expected to do as 50m pound striker (like rounding Victor Valdez at the Camp Nou). But through it all, he's had to endure far more unfair criticism than he has received undeserved praise, and I DO think that he's finally doing some things that actually merit some plaudits. Am I saying he's player of the season? Of course not, but he's playing better, scoring some goals, and doing what's expected of him. He deserves a pat on the back, and a few words of encouragement. And it's always tiresome to see fans on this sub who absolutely cannot give him any small amount of credit without reminding everyone about his failures in some capacity. ""well he's still not scoring in the league...well he might be scoring CL goals, but not against good teams!"" Just give it a rest! The last month he's shown far more positive signs than negative, and in my opinion he deserves some praise without any backhanded critiques to go along with it. 

As for your final point. My ""take that shit somewhere else"" comment was solely directed at your pretentious *I've watched this game longer than you, you clearly don't understand the game* attitude, which is not only unfounded (for all you know I've been a season ticket holder since before you were born), but it's also an obnoxious ignorant attitude that already runs rampant in r/soccer, that is making it's way into this sub at an alarming rate. I'm not suggesting you ""go anywhere"" and to be honest, I could give a shit whether or not you're a mod, or someone who's joined the sub last week. That sort of attitude has no place in this sub, and to be honest, I expect mods like yourself to be among the LAST to stoop to such a level. I sincerely hope that just because you're a mod, you don't feel a sense of entitlement that allows you to engage in such childish discourse. 

I think our back and forth has run it's course and I hope, if nothing else, we each have a better understanding of our opposing views. I honestly respect your views, and for the most part agree with a large part of them. Apologies for the lengthy response.

&gt;He might end up leaving but it's not like we'd be left in the lurch. Sakho is only 23 and only going to improve.

Really? I know it seems like we have a ton of CB options right now, but keep in mind that Toure is 400,000 years old, and that Skrtel is (as he showed last year) prone to runs of truly embarrassing form, even though he's playing quite well at the moment. Or, of course, either one of them could easily get injured. In the future we'll probably have Wisdom as well, but he's definitely a long-term option, especially if Derby keep playing him at RB, so I doubt he'll be ready to come right into the team at CB next year.

&gt;Let's not pretend Agger started the season well either.

He did give away that PK in the first match, sure, but that would've been pretty difficult for anyone to avoid; I'd say it's quite a different error than, say, Sakho nearly putting the ball into our net for an own goal. And it's worth noting that every single clean sheet we've had this season was with Agger on the field. He didn't start the season in top Agger form, no, but nobody really started the season in top form aside from Mignolet. The team as a whole hadn't put together a decent second half until yesterday.

&gt;There's a lot of ""He's Danny Agger! He's got YNWA tattooed on his knuckles! He's the vice captain! Why isn't he playing?"" 

I don't think this is so easily brushed aside, though. There's a reason he's the vice captain and a reason he's so beloved by the fans. He's a good leader and he has the right spirit. Currently, I think Toure is filling that role on the field -- and he's great at it -- but he's also 32 years old. In a year or two, he's going to be either retired or pretty useless, while Agger will still have at least a few good years left. I think it'd be very stupid to let a vice captain and a man who's played very well for us *for years* leave just because our back three has been *decent*  without him in a short run of games against pretty unimpressive teams. If Kolo-Skrtel-Sakho somehow manage to hold Arsenal scoreless, I might change my mind, but given that they coughed up two to *Newcastle*, I'd say that's pretty unlikely. 

I think if we let Agger leave, in the long term we are really going to regret it.",0,1382883842,null,0,1382884199,0,cd0m52y,t3_1pb1kr,t1_cd0m52y,t1_cd0jtro,null,1428967115,31,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,31

- Olive Shed, by the M-Shed on the river (where the Industrial Museum used to be) also a little more pricey than standard, but lovely food and has a really good reputation (I think Raymond Blanc may have written that he loved it or something like that - so if you're trying to impress someone it might be the right place).

I'll get in to work at 8:55am bang on, same as every day. No trains delayed, no madness, nothing.

5:30pm on the dot, storm will hit, trains for the next 4 hours cancelled, 50 minute train journey becomes a 3 hour train journey stuffed with people like sardines and I get home at 1:30am.

Trains next morning will be fine again.

Always happens.

Email from South West Trains:

&gt;*We are advising passengers not to travel tomorrow (Monday 28 October 2013) as weather forecasters warn of hurricane-force winds and heavy rain across the south of the country.*

&gt;*We will be operating a significantly reduced timetable on Monday, with the majority of services not expected to run until at least 0800. Across the network, trains will run at a maximum of 50mph as a safety measure in case of obstructions on the tracks. This will result in extended journey times on services.*

&gt;*Maintenance teams are checking high-risk sites to carry out work to reduce the impact from flooding and fallen trees. Extra staff are also being deployed at key locations across the network to help keep trains running. Test trains will run from early in the morning to check routes are safe to operate.*

&gt;*The alterations to services are designed to maintain safety across the network, give passengers greater certainty on what trains will be running, and help avoid knock-on disruption.*

*There will be no service between Ascot and Ash Vale, Salisbury and Bristol, Virginia Water and Weybridge*

&gt;*A very limited service will operate on the following routes:*
&gt;*-Aldershot to Guildford *
&gt;*-Chessington Branch *
&gt;*-Hampton Court Branch *
&gt;*-Shepperton Branch*

true,1eejit,ni-derry,Derry,"David Mitchell:
&gt;But there's one area where our opinions obviously differ. I think that the unprecedented involvement of politicians in the regulation of the press has, in the long term, the potential to be catastrophic, and is too big a risk to take in an attempt to redress the obvious wrongs in the culture and conduct of newspapers. You think that there is either no risk, or a small risk to set against the bigger picture of injustices committed by the press.

This is basically what it comes down to. Mitchell thinks that the risk of 2/3rds of **both** Houses of Parliament amending the independent press regulator in a draconian manner is too great for the payoff, Coogan doesn't. 

Personally I'm with Coogan on that, the House of Lords in particular would **never** have a majority (let alone a 2/3rds majority) for such measures. *And if there was such support did they could just introduce authoritarian constraints on the press ex novo rather than modifying an existing Leveson-style body*",0,1382887629,null,0,1382887846,0,cd0n4i5,t3_1pb6o8,t1_cd0n4i5,t3_1pb6o8,null,1428966657,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I live there, I don't think its the greatest city, but it does (i think) offer a solid overall quality that many cities don't.

It has no end of pubs, inc a few that are regarded as some of the oldest in the country. Its got two rather fantastic cathedrals (if you like that sorta thing). Its a very old city so it has no end of history, interesting architecture and culture. It has every shop you would ever want, and some fantastic restaurants, it has 2 very good cinemas (and 2 not so good ones). The streets are clean, it has a low crime rate. It has 3 very good music venues (inc the art center which is wonderful), the house prices here are reasonable (well - in the surrounding villages at least), it has a leading university with a very good art center. It also has one of the best librarys in the country. And finally....because its out in Norfolk the city doesn't get a lot of through traffic, which makes it somthing of a hidden gem.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; This is the type of misinformed irrelevant point that Steve Coogan is arguing against. Did you read the article?

Yes; I just disagree with it.  That's okay isn't it?  I don't disagree with the perfectly modest, unsubjective laws (equal prominence is fine).  What I object to is the establishment of _any_ sort of committee, or regulatory body.  They do not work, and will never work.  Concentration of power is always going to fail.  Did you read David Mitchell's response, which seemed fine to me?

&gt; I think that the unprecedented involvement of politicians in the regulation of the press has, in the long term, the potential to be catastrophic, and is too big a risk to take in an attempt to redress the obvious wrongs in the culture and conduct of newspapers. You think that there is either no risk, or a small risk to set against the bigger picture of injustices committed by the press. I don't think you're insane to think that – I just don't agree.

---

&gt; Leveson's proposals won't neuter the press

Of course they will.  Any regulation leaves the regulating party with power over the regulated party.

&gt; politicians wouldn't regulate the industry

Of course they will.  What country have you been living in?  There are no independent regulators.  For example, see the ""independent"" IWF.  Ofwat, ofgen, ofanything.  They all bend to the government decree's in the end.  They have to, they are funded by the government, therefore they cannot be independent (even if that funding is raised by taxing the regulated party, it is still the government that holds the power to do that, and set the level).

&gt; and the problem isn't only that celebrities are lied about - ""ordinary"" people suffer the same or worse.

My argument stands -- it is the price we pay.  I'm not minimising the damage the press can do to both celebs and everyone else; the problem is that as soon as you give anyone the power to control the press (beyond our existing libel and slander laws, but they are nothing to do with the press directly) then you are creating a giant hole that politicians can drive corruption through.

The problem with all regulation is that it's judged on it's intentions rather than on its results.  Anti-terrorism legislation has good intents, but is documented as having been abused.  Why would press regulation be any different?

It's naive to think that when the chair of the press regulation committee's son is photographed taking cocaine in a club, that pressure wouldn't be brought to bear.  I can't even think of the number of stories that _already_ probably aren't reported but would be in the public interest.  Why would that be improved by having a regulator?  

The answer to free speech you don't like, is not a gag, it's more free speech.  Better would be to start breaking the cosy little relationship between politicians and the press that exists now.  No access no story is a ridiculous state of affairs.  That would do more good than regulation.",0,1382888763,null,0,1382889263,0,cd0nglk,t3_1pb6o8,t1_cd0nglk,t1_cd0mzha,null,1428966500,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Regarding the Dembele situation, I think we've seen Paul and Dembele should not play together, as they are both players that are always trying to *sort of* attack - rather than pivot off of each other. We need that CDM in Sandro or Capoue behind one of them to provide the security that when they push forward, there is an enforcer behind to mop up any counter. 

This is looking like the best pairing, much like Sandro and Dembele was incredibly effective last season before his injury.

true,shakawhenthewallsfel,lfc12,,"&gt;Sakho, whatever you might think, offers a lot more than Agger.

Does he? He's taller, sure. But he's shaky on set pieces, and he certainly doesn't offer the leadership that Agger does. In the long run he *may* prove to be the better choice but I think it's extremely premature to discard Agger in favor of him after a short run of halfway decent games that were, again, mostly against pretty shit teams. 

&gt;We've got Wisdom, Ilori, Sakho, Skrtel, Coates, and possibly Kelly

Kelly isn't a CB, and Wisdom may not be either by the time we get him back. Coates is not good enough, and maybe this is harsh but I don't think he ever will be; I highly doubt we'll ever see him as a fixture in the first team. Ilori is an unknown quantity, but given that he literally hasn't played a single minute yet it seems pretty retarded to discard our vice captain just because we have him as a backup. In terms of guys who will be first-team quality over the next few years, we have Sakho, Skrtel, Agger, and *maybe* Wisdom.

&gt;Agger we'd buy another CB too.

Who? You may recall that we had some trouble attracting the targets we want this summer. That's no reason not to go for it, of course, but I think it's going to be way easier to keep Agger than to try to replace him with someone as good.

&gt;You seem to think Agger doesn't want to leave either. I think he does.

I think it's much more likely that people on the centre right complain about media bias because of the fact that in polling of journalists a vast majority self-identify as being left of centre rather than right of centre.

A team here couldn't rely on regular continental support, it would have to draw significant support from London itself and I don't believe the game is big enough at the moment for that to happen, it might be one day and a team here might help it to that level but for now I don't think it's a good idea, it would certainly be a risk.",0,1382891299,null,0,false,0,cd0o9fb,t3_1pbi61,t1_cd0o9fb,t3_1pbi61,null,1428966125,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I would guess there are perhaps 30,000-50,000 genuine fans in the UK, with similar numbers in Germany (who are much more likely to fly to London for a game than the US). So, in terms of fans, there's probably enough to fill a 30,000 seat stadium on a regular basis... which should be enough for a franchise.

However, there are many obstacles to having a franchise in London. Finding a suitable stadium would be very difficult (there's talk of Tottenham re-designing their new stadium to accomodate the NFL, but the current soccer stadia would really struggle to include regular NFL games while maintaining a quality pitch). There's also the issue that things like wage-caps and the NFL draft fall foul of EU employment law... I don't see the NFL changing just to accommodate EU law, but I also don't see the EU granting a legal exception to the NFL, so I don't see how that circle will be squared.

true,chilari,eng-shropshire,Shropshire,"For my part, I similarly know what will happen: after a night of rain, the road to work will be flooded in three places. One of these locations, on the A454 in Shropshire between Swancote and Wyken, will be particularly bad; at 7:30am I'll just about manage to drive through it at 5mph, though shortly afterwards it will be closed.

The other two spots where it'll flood, either side of Trescott in South Staffordshire, will not cause closures - though the ford at Trescott will get shut. On the way in to work in the morning, some cunt in a 4x4 will drive very quickly in the opposite direction through the second of these flood spots, near the sewerage works, creating a bow wave that washes completedly over the top of my car, temporarily blinding me and making me flinch.

On my way home, passing the ford at Trescott, I will see the roof and only the roof of a car in the ford, in spite of the earlier closure and cones, the measuring stick showing the ford's depth and so on.

Following the closure of the A454 between the Royal Oak roundabout and Bridgnorth due to flooding near Wyken, the rain will stop around noon and the water will drain away by 4pm. However, the road will remain closed, and rather than drive through that section of road at 5pm, I'll be diverted to the right, off towards Sutton Maddock - a small settlement with a petrol station that's half way between Bridgnorth and Telford. I might decide to take the rural route, cutting the corner, but frankly the relative sleeds its possible to travel at mean it's probably just as quick to go all the way to the Sutton Maddock roundabout, then back into Bridgnorth from there - a diversion route in total about 4 times the distance than the route being diverted from. The A454 near Wyken will be reopened at about 6pm - several hours after it could have safely been reopened and far too late for me to be able to use it.

This is my prediction. I have been working in Wolverhampton less than 2 years and if what is described above happens exactly as described it won't be the first time, or the second, or even the third in that time.

Here, I made a map: http://goo.gl/maps/uLfPN You can see the diversion and I've used C to mark the location of where the flooded bit of road will be that causes that great big diversion.

Torres. Man of the match for me. Missed a sitter then made a beautiful run and low cross for Shurrle. And finally, in the dying minutes, scores the winner. One assist, one goal despite limited service from the midfield.

Despite the fact that City's CBs weren't first-choice we decided to play on the wings. Oscar I felt didn't have enough of the ball. Like I said, City dominated in possession, but then again we killed them on counters.

true,WillSpur,flair2,,"My thoughts:

- Eriksen should be starting, Holtby wasn't bad. But I can't help but feel constant minutes from Eriksen will only benefit, he is the bigger talent and threat. 




- Andre really needs to shift away from even *travelling* such key players to the Europa games, let alone playing them. It tires/takes it out of them, look at what happened with West Ham, and look at what happened today. We are essentially qualified now.




- Townsend still looks as good as he's ever been, and really does look like *he was born to play for spurs*. So much drive and passion to play, even after he had that nasty fall. 


- We have serious problems unlocking teams defences, this kind of links in to my first point with Eriksen. If Lamela was playing regularly and was in the likes of his Roma form (I know he isn't), he also would be a great solution to our problems (Townsend - Eriksen - Lamela).




- Chiriches looks good, but he needs to take not so many risks with his play. Overall though he continues to look like a solid defender for us. 





- On the bright side, we're not playing that well and still finding results and evidently a side that needs to settle and find its stride - however we got lucky today. Very soft penalty. 


- We are too **SIDEWAYS**, not enough movement and not enough penetration/forward passes (again, see above  regarding Eriksen). It's always the same passing it around the box with not enough ideas what to do with it. 


- This is obvious, but we need to start scoring and and scoring more...sharpish. The way the top 6 or even 7 is looking this year...goal difference is going to be incredibly important.

We don't have the players to suit Soldado. Our wingers play more as inside forwards and show almost no desire to cross the ball. Our fullbacks usually do most of the crossing, and Walker can't get a ball past the first man. 

I think Adebayor is the missing link. I think his hold up play would add a lot of fluidity to our attacks. Soldado has good movement and has shown he can play creative passes around the box, but I think Adebayor would be an improvement.

We used to have players like Keane, Berbatov, Modric, VDV etc, who were adept at interplay in the box and really carving open defences. At present we don't have any strikers of that ilk (possibly Adebayor but he doesn't look likely to play in the Premier League for some time). The only players we have that look likely to open up a defence are Erikson and Holtby, and both are still finding their feet.

These people are morons, ignore them. I have no idea how they are upvoted nor what exactly their experience is but no GK coach worth his salt would see his decision to come off his line to meet the ball as a bad call without the retrospective problem that occurred. In fact, people are currently praising Lloris for doing exactly that. It became a problem because of lack of communication, the initial decision was correct.

It was an absolutely fine decision. He saw a potential gap and moved off of his line quickly enough to deal with the situation before it developed into a problem.

His mistake was not anticipating Nastasic's movement and calling for it, not that he came off his line in the first place. Due to this, when Nastasic moved he had that tenth of a second of hesitation, during which time he re-decided to go for the ball then shouted too late for Nastasic to react and stop his header.

The problem here wasn't one of decision making, it was one of not anticipating the flight of the ball and the speed at which Nastasic was back peddling properly.

The tenth of a second of hesitation is just how humans react to a new variable in an equation during which time fast moving objects such as ball have travelled a bit, in driving they call it ""thinking time"". If you know a way to coach thinking time out of situation that has changed from one scenario to a different one for a goalkeeper, you let me know and I'll give you 50% of my earnings for the next ten years.

As I said the biggest impact on smoking has been educating kids that it kills you (more teenagers in this generation say they wont smoke then ever before) and the smoking ban indoors (which let me tell you I'd never go back to having to sit in smoky pubs again).

The best way to combat things like obesity is the same way. If there was evidence that you could tax something to reduce it's consumption without increasing poverty (as some people will forgo other items to get their 'fix') then I'd be all for a fast food tax or something. It just doesn't work that well.

I don't see smokers as some oppressed minority, they can still smoke all they want, the government has spent decades trying to make smoking socially unacceptable for the good of the nation and I can't say I disagree with it.

&gt; But the UK doesn't have violent crime rates anywhere near that low

Violent crime rates in the UK are relatively low. But more importantly, the MURDER rate is extremely low, which is the relevant stat. In 2012 the murder rate of the UK compared the to Japan is 300%. The murder rate per capita of the US to Japan by contrast is 1200%, and four times that of the UK. The gap was less historically: within the last two decades the murder rate of the UK and Japan has often been even.

Thats a staggering difference. 

Of course violent crime exists in numbers that are problematic. One violent crime is problematic. There are ""plenty of rapes robberies, assaults"" even in places like Japan and Iceland.

But by international standards the number of gun deaths and the number of murders in the UK is very low. And that fact is a major prop in favour of gun controls, both in policymaking, and in public opinion.

Handgun laws are the way they are in the UK due to specific prominent handgun murders. The public attitude toward them is framed entirely in the context of gun deaths. So those are the stats you need to look at in understanding both the laws and public feeling generally.

I don't think we can say for sure that Suarez would leave at the end of the season even if we kept our current position in the table. Any English club good enough to finish in the top 4 and qualify for the Champions League is good enough to win it. English clubs have been very competitive in the CL for about a decade now (last year excluded). I'm just saying that if we do find ourselves in the CL next year, I honestly don't think Suarez will be itching for a move away as much as he was this past summer, if at all.

With our scouting dept and the huge improvement in our squad over the last 2 windows, we could do great things to our squad in the next 2 windows.

Overall, I think the calibre of our squad next season if we were to finish 3rd-4th would dwarf our squad from 2004/05 in terms of talent, and therefore it wouldn't be so out of the question for us to win it.

Again though, this is ALL hypothetical so even as I was typing this I felt my point was moot, but so be it. I think this conversation will be much more relevant 6 months from now anyway.

&gt;""Yet even after thorough police and child welfare investigations, some pedophiles are found to have no history of sexual contacts with children. [...] Seto &amp; Eke (2005) followed a sample of child pornography offenders for an average of 2.5 years. The majority of these offenders would likely be diagnosed as pedophiles (Seto et al. 2006). A small proportion (4%) committed a contact sexual offense during this time period. This suggests that having a sexual interest in children is not a sufficient factor to explain sexual offending against children. In Seto &amp; Eke's (2005) study, child pornography offenders with any kind of prior criminal history were more likely to commit a contact sexual offense, or an offense of any kind, during the follow-up period. This finding suggests that it is the pedophiles who are more likely to engage in antisocial or criminal behavior of any kind—which would include individuals who are impulsive, callous, and willing to take risks; individuals who become disinhibited as a result of substance misuse; and individuals who endorse antisocial attitudes and beliefs such as a disregard for social norms or the laws—who pose the greatest risk of acting upon their sexual interest in children (Seto 2008). In contrast, one would predict that pedophiles who are reflective, sensitive to the feelings of others, averse to risk, abstain from alcohol or drug use, and endorse attitudes and beliefs supportive of norms and the laws would be unlikely to commit contact sexual offenses against children.""",0,1382903607,null,0,false,0,cd0sxyj,t3_1p7v40,t1_cd0sxyj,t1_cczyf8t,null,1428963942,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Your ""kind of not getting it"" is just ridiculous, and if you ask me, is just willful incomprehension. Nothing beats the security of knowing that weapons, particularly concealed weapons, are not readily available to so-called ""decent people"" (of which one in so many must have an undiagnosed mental health issue on the basis of statistical distribution).

In British society ""decent people"" have no need for weapons in their homes, since they are protected in society and aren't living on the edge of nowhere in a self-survival mentality that demands the right to use lethal force for a sense of protection. To be honest the very idea of some distinction between ""decent people"" and criminals is just a logical fallacy. 

Frankly all allowing weapons to be used for ""self-protection"" does is escalate the levels of violence and fear everyone lives under. And whilst it is true in a few minority of inner city areas in the UK people do live in fear of violent crime such as mugging, all easy access to fire arms in the general population will do is make criminals more jumpy and less likely to take risks such as letting their victims walk away.

He's absolutely right to criticise the home support. More pressure on the team to make big achievements makes for a tense atmosphere at home games as people stupidly think we'll be able to walk over most of the teams in the PL.

I believe it's also to do with the aging population the average home crowd. The massive ST waiting list (like 45k now isn't it?) is evidence that people aren't giving them up and that WHL just doesn't have the capacity to match demand. Young people, who are generally louder, aren't able to go to games as they're priced out with the lack of home tickets going to non-STs and the prices continually rising. Then there's StubHub as the massive ""fuck you"" cherry on top.

There's a reason a lot of fans are negative at the moment - some say it's AVB's style because it's not attacking enough. But I think with fans paying so much for tickets, and a lot of the people who are willing to sing priced out of going, it seems like that's the biggest cause of the problem to me because high prices breeds high expectations. Our current expectations are driven by the hype of we should be winning everything.

The mortgage payments set him back £700 pcm.  There were other identical flats nearby going for £2000pcm on the private rental market and he literally couldn't have afforded it as his take home pay was a shade under that.

As a result he took dozens and dozens of shots throughout the season that really had no chance of going in. Obviously some did, but I felt most of the time we just wasted possession.

Now we have players like Sturridge, Coutinho, Hendo, Gerrard as well as our full-backs all able to provide him with quality, consistent service and he's much better at linking up with others as well. He knows that he's not the only striker on the team who can score a goal and he doesn't have to create chances for himself out of nothing like he used to.

Long may SAS continue, I can't wait to see them link up with Coutinho and Hendo again. It's been so long.",0,1382904415,null,0,false,0,cd0t9ku,t3_1pbjq6,t1_cd0t9ku,t3_1pbjq6,null,1428963790,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Many of us would love to part-take in target shooting with handguns. I certainly would. I've done shotguns, archery, crossbows and large rifles.

&gt; The problem with handguns is that it's difficult to come up with a legitimate reason to want/need one (and therefore introduce them into the UK) other than it being nice; the nature of that weapon is to kill a human, concealment, limited use in law enforcement or use in crime. Ownership here is about hunting or target shooting.

I'm glad to read that. I'm not so much a fan of the Concealed Weapons a lot of folks in the U.S. work with.

&gt; Funnily the whole ""restricted access"" view of the UK's gun laws are a) a myth and b) entirely self-inflicted. Practically every single person on an average British street could have a gun with very little time and effort - they simply choose not to!

Considering we can own Barrett 50. Cal weapons seemingly easier than our U.S. Counterparts indeed!

I personally would love to see less restrictions on the type of firearms, no public carry (Unless you're moving to a range or something similar, maybe a city/town/village carry prohibition?) I'd love to do some range shooting with an LMG, Handgun or semi-auto rifle... just because. But that's me.

true,Petrified_Waffle,flair7,,"I defintely see OP's point, because let's be honest the creativity is lacking and has done since last season. I think the main point is that we have won 3 games 1-0 with a penalty in each, and yes, 1-0 is 3 points, but you can't rely on a penalty every week to win games. If that penalty hadn't been given would we have scored? most likely not because we didn't get in behind, test harper or cut them open anywhere near enough. 

Admittedly the team is gelling, although i don't think even Villas Boas knows his best eleven yet which makes the process a little longer. We are keeping more clean sheets which is great and gives a good platform to build on, but as we saw with West Ham if you don't score first in these type of games then its almost impossible to get the win as their just gonna continue to sit back and frustrate. I think thats where the worry comes from, because we need to win these 'bread and butter' games if we want top 4 this season and we are really struggling over the line so far, which won't always be the case (e.g west ham)

Having said all that i don't think we should panic yet as we are picking up wins whilst not playing well and it will take time to win these games in the style that the top boys do, but we do need that creative spark when we get to the buisness end of the season.

Also, it would be lovely to hammer someone 5 or 6-0. I honestly can't remember the last time we did that!

Thats why the gun laws and level of gun ownership are what they are in the UK. The correct belief that their presence in most situations makes deaths vastly more likely, and a number of specific historical events where large numbers of gun deaths led to a public reaction.

Bringing non fatal crimes into the analysis is as relevant as bringing embezzlement or or fraud in. People aren't concerned that guns will make them more likely to be a victim of crime, whether by domestic violence or being burgled, or assaulted at random, or getting robbed. They are concerned that people are more likely to die when such a situation happens.

I suspect in the context of the UK discourse a higher level of violent crime would make support for gun restriction STRONGER, as the number of situations when a person would be at risk of death were the assailant armed would increase.

I suspect were we to have Japan levels of violent crime then there would in fact be significantly fewer firearms restrictions, as the widely publicised shootings and the public fear of violence that led to their existence would have been fewer or not present.

TLDR: I am not sure why you think more violence and crime should relate to more support for guns. Guns are a problem because they cause more DEATHS, both intentionally and unintentionally, not that they cause more (or less) crime/violence.",0,1382905885,null,0,1382907973,0,cd0tuyk,t3_1pbt8v,t1_cd0tuyk,t1_cd0tns4,null,1428963443,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

""When introducing someone to a show, the going is rough if the first few episodes aren't particularly good. In the case of the new run of Doctor Who, it's tough to get someone to watch past the first three episodes. You can show them an amazing episode from later on in the series, but typically the reason that episode is amazing is because it relies on things you learn earlier or it reveals potential spoilers.

Blink is amazing not only because is it a great episode, but it is shown through the eyes of a one-off set of characters. They learn about the Doctor and his powers the same way a new viewer does -- confused and ripped out of their normal lives for an amazing ride. It gives new viewers a taste of what Doctor Who is all about -- science fiction with heart and humor -- that gives them the push they need to get through the first few episodes and become true Whovians without ruining the experience of the earlier story arcs."" - /u/coldstar

I think you have missed it, although I should have included the point you now make, and why it is not seen as especially relevant in the UK discourse, as my post did raise that issue:

I think the point is that we simply don't believe in the scenario you lay out.

The successful use of guns for self defence is not at all common, especially compared to the number of homicides.

Its LOVELY when it happens, but one has to be realistic, and accept the world is not an ass kicking Bruce Willis movie, but one where a gun in the home is many times more likely to result in an accidental injury or death than it is ever to be used against a home invader.

So when I referred to deaths, I was NOT referring to the idea that the rapist would get shot as being horrifying. In fact you can read everyone one of the ""Deaths"" I emphasize as referring entirely to innocent people, victims, or suicides. I wasn't including the idea of the rapist/assailant getting shot at all. Because I think that is largely a macho iillusion, which is a stance largely supported by figures.

The incredibly rare chance that I will ever get to shoot a wannabe rapist is so not worth a significantly increased chance of the death of myself, my family, or any other innocent person, even those I don't know, that it doesn't even seem worth considering. Points regarding gun safety can obviously argue against the accident/unintentional numbers. However I CARE about the innocent kids of parents who are total tools and don't look after their guns. I want those kids and those they associate with safe. In the scenario you lay out it is the woman who is more likely to end up dead if guns are freely available than the rapist. 

That said it may be we value the idea of revenge upon assailants somewhat less, so that the idea of being able to injure or killer a wrongdoer has significantly less worth attached to it. Personally I couldn't give a shit what happens to anyone who threatens me or my family: my only concern is mine and their safety. Statistically THEM *having the ability to be* armed is much, much worse for that calculation than ME *having the ability to be* being armed.

I suspect that is probably at the root of much of the UK mindset you are trying to investigate: the idea that widespread gun ownership makes you safer through its powers of self defence would be near universally mocked. The feelings are not, I suspect especially strong. Its just thought of as somewhat naive.

*Further edit to make a personal point of only partial relevance:* Personally, were I in a society it was easy to get a gun at short notice, I would, without question, be dead. I would have shot myself. It was only the time it took to acquire a firearm in this country that gave me time to recover enough to seek help, along with a failure using another, significantly less instantly fatal, method. So I am insanely greatful they are neither easily attainable, nor widely present.

I know a group of people from my uni went down to the game last year and the vast majority went for the spectacle of the thing rather than any real love of the game. Once it becomes a regular thing that novelty disappears 

On top of this no premier league club is realistically going to be willing to share a pitch. The rugby world cup is being hosted here in 2015 and a lot of pressure was placed on premiership clubs to get them to open their stadiums for even a couple of games let alone a full blown season of games that average 3 hours each. Potentially west ham's old ground might become available when they move to the Olympic Stadium.

Also sports is already a bit of a saturated market in the UK generally and London especially. Only counting the top flights of winter sports that it would be competing against there are six football clubs, two rugby union clubs, a rugby league club and endless other more niche sports. Added into this mix are occasional big event boxing and tennis matches at the O2.

As others have said it seems unlikely without building a large London grass roots first and I just don't think the sport is there yet.

true,Link_95,k9,K-9,"Start from Rose (episode 1 of the modern show).  The first few episodes are kinda boring, but they get better.  Netflix has every episode of the modern series except one 10th doctor special and one 11th doctor christmas special for some odd reason but they have little to no effects on the overall story so it doesn't really matter if you watch them.  Netflix also doesn't have the 'current' series, but I imagine they'll be adding it soon since it's been a year after the series began and 5 months since it's ended.

Once you finish the modern series (maybe you'll be able to watch every episode in time for the 50th) you could go and explore the classic show if you'd like to.  It has a much different feel to it, it's much slower paced and the acting in the first few seasons isn't that great but it's charming.  Plus you'll find that you appreciate the modern show more (that's what happened to me) because of the updated special effects, acting, and dozens of references sprinkled through episodes that will suddenly make sense as they were referring to the classic show.  Take the current series for example, 2 monsters that haven't been in the show since the 60s/70s have showed up and you can't really appreciate how awesome it is unless you've actually seen the classic episodes they appear in.

Not bad for a city with a population of 20,000! 

The train station is well connected, at the bottom of the hill next to the big Tesco: about 14 minutes and you can be in Cambridge, and there's a train every half hour into King's Cross. As I said, there's plenty of shops. Sainsburys, Waitrose, Tesco, WHSmith, Blockbuster, a bunch of takeaways and hairdressers, and special mention to the Topping bookshop which is world class. The city just got fibre optic this year as well.

The place isn't perfect. The area around Deacon's Lane can be pretty rough, most of the social housing is concentrated in that area. Most of the crime seems to happen in the North West of the city, around Upherd's Lane or just outside Cromwell's House. Mostly ASB though, and crime is [down 20%](http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Ely/Crime-in-East-Cambs-is-reducing-apart-from-burglaries-20130411133225.htm) in 2012/13. Very safe place in general. Areas like Barton Square can be dominated by students from the school in Ely. May be a bit quiet for some, there's pretty much no night life, but as I said in 14 minutes you can be in Cambridge and an hour and you're in King's Cross so if that's what you want you can do that.",0,1382909929,null,0,false,0,cd0vfk7,t3_1pb6du,t1_cd0vfk7,t3_1pb6du,null,1428962710,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Lastly, although we are in desperate need of multiple exchanges, I would not forget market forces. ie the moment it looks as if running a bitcoin exchange is a profit making viable business, expect an external party (think of travelx and similar) to jump straight in and leverage their entire FX business expertise to undercut and wipe out any independent exchanges.

Another reason I am pro-knife, so to speak, is because they are obviously useful for many purposes. Admittedly, some blades are clearly designed for only one purpose, but ultimately knives are a multi-purpose tool and have legitimate non-violent uses.
In addition to that, because the public don't carry guns and the police also do not (usually) carry guns, then criminals usually don't bother with guns themselves, as they are rarely outmatched by their victims anyway. Giving the public guns ensures that criminals MUST use guns as well, if they are to stand a chance.

true,EJR94,lfcflame,,"Well, I'd say we're Arsenals real first test in the league. Mertesacker and Koscielney might look solid against some of the lesser strike forces in the league but the pace of Sturridge and the trickery of Suarez I can't see them keeping up. Mertesacker is going to have a nightmare keeping up with either of them and his job is made even harder by Flamini being out. 

This, however, is our first game against a quality attacking midfield. Lucas is going to be overworked and as much as I love Coutinho, we need Henderson otherwise we'll be ripped apart. I think our defence should be able to cope against Giroud but we'll have three CBs against one striker and one defensive mid against 3 attacking mids (assuming we line up in a 3-5-2 again) which gives them far too much space.  I think we'll win personally, SaS are just too good at the moment and Arsenal will concede. But, I don't think we'll escape unscathed, there will be goals at both ends but we should edge it. Also knocking Arsenal's momentum would be great for our top 4 chances. I know we're third but I think it'll be a challenge to get top 4. That said both City and Chelsea looked poor today, looking at their teams you can see plenty of weaknesses and their style of football just looks like league one level. Chelsea, City, United, Spurs all look worse than us so far but the league has never ended in November, we still could combust at any moment

The 10 year average 1995-2004 of deaths from hurricanes: 21

The 30 year average 1975-2004 of deaths from hurricanes: 15


http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/hazstats.shtml

And that is per season I believe, with more than one per season. 

If you want to talk about wind speed, the great storm had gusts measured at 122mph, and according to the BBC: Katrina's sustained wind speed was approximately 200 km/h (124mph). Ok that is sustained, but if we look at the first two of 2012 we have:

Tropical Storm Alberto
&gt;At 2250 UTC on May 19, a ship near Alberto reported winds of 60mph

Tropical Storm Beryl

&gt;made landfall near Jacksonville Beach, Florida, with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). The storm was the strongest pre-season tropical cyclone to make landfall on record. It quickly weakened to a tropical depression

I think our storm was closer to a Hurricane than a bit of breeze.

&gt; Arsenal like expected are enjoying nothing but a good fixtures list.

Pretty much this, I roll my eyes when pundits salivate over Arsenal.

Yes, nine weeks in Arsenal have won most of their games in an uncharacteristic (for the past... 7 years) fashion. But honestly who has been their most difficult opposition?

A Spurs team that hadn't scored in open play on Week 3, Swansea on Week 6, or West Brom, that had recently defeated Man Utd., on Week 7?

Or perhaps their most difficult match was their home and season opener to Aston Villa, a team that's currently resting in the lower third of the table.

Tuesday marks the long march for Arsenal. Chelsea, Liverpool, United, Saints(5) and then a two week reprieve before they face Everton and then City away. That's just league matches too.

I reckon once Arsenal have to face some ranked opposition and not bottom feeder teams like Palace and Sunderland, their grip on first will loosen and they'll revert to their former ways of choking and losing. I don't hate Arsenal, I think they keep competition in London more interesting, but I can't stand this 'we're winning the league' bullfuckery.

Morningside Road has turned into somewhat of a clone high street.  I can vaguely remember the days before the chains and coffee shops moved in.  Caffe Nero used to be an outward bound shop called ""One Step Ahead"", and the Waitrose was originally a Safeway then Morrisons.  I'm sure M&amp;S and Superdrug haven't been around forever, although The Merlin has :-)  The traditional Scaramouch stationary place died a few years ago.  The unit was derelict for a while until it was redeveloped and bloody Sainsbury's moved in, and I see the church on the corner of Hermitage Terrace is now a Pizza Express.  Even the barber in the old station office has now closed as of a few months ago.  That was a key fixture in my childhood.

Rose Street is just boring as it's quite dingy and I hardly ever bought anything there.  George Street is expensive boutiques not aimed at me, and Princes Street is yet another clone high street.

true,thomasfk,lfcflame,,"* Arteta will not miss the match (he serves his 1 match ban in the Chelsea game mid-week)
* I give it less than a 1% chance that Bendtner starts unless Giroud is injured. He is too good to leave out.

In terms of comparing strength of line-up:

* With injuries to Walcott, Ox, and Podolski, they are missing some key wingers to their side. I give Liverpool's attack the edge.
* Their midfield is miles better than ours. Our only hope is that the organization of Gerrard and Lucas and the pressing of Henderson can make it difficult for their creative players.(Yes, I am suggesting that Henderson should start this one over Coutinho to provide some pressure on their midfield. If I am certain that Coutinho is 100%, then he would get the nod.)
* The defenses and GKs I would rate about the same.

Basically, with their strength in midfield, look for Arsenal to keep a lot of possession and limit the touches that Suarez and Sturridge get on the ball. With all of the possession they have, they will be pressed high up the pitch.

Our best avenue to attack will be on the counter. BvB proved midweek that they are susceptible on the counter and that will be our key strength in this game. We have speedy players in Sturridge and Suarez and 3 midfielders that are all capable of playing a good ball from deep. There will not be much space for our players in midfield, so most of our attacks will have to be swift and precise.

If we decide to play a 3-5-2 with wingers pushed up the flanks, that could provide a different dimension to the game. For one, without any real wingers in their side (out to injuries), most of their play will be possession based build up through the middle. The players they do have out wide will always be looking to cut in. They don't really have any touchline wingers so to speak at the moment. That leaves our wing backs with room in front of them to pin back Sagna and Gibbs. We could be over-run in midfield though by leaving our 2 forwards up top.

We got the last train back and, walking through the station, a wee boy came up to me and wanted to know if I was a millionaire (fucking hardly!). He was with his mum, two sisters and dad, and they were lovely but obviously quite poor (his dad was missing a couple of teeth and wearing a dirty old tracksuit) but he was made up when I had a natter about them and tried to explain that they weren't *that* expensive. I felt like a bit of a cunt afterwards, since it was pretty obvious that they had nothing but his dad was made up that I spoke to him, which was nice. I come from a working class family and a shite area, and stuff like that always freaks me out a bit, since it's not like I feel any better than people who are still in those areas. It was a weird end to the night.

We were due to go to a gig last night but the rain was going sideways so skipped it and stayed in with booze, a brain-shaped jelly and Strictly instead. Today was just a bit of food shopping and listening to the roof trying to blow away. I'll be able to afford a replacement one day.

This week:

1) Big job-cum-house clearance tomorrow, which should hopefully tide me over for most of the week. An old bloke's died and his daughter wants his house cleared. He allegedly has a lot of nice furniture and about a thousand books, most of which are ""old"". I'm expecting a fuck ton of Reader's Digests but you never know, there might be a Gutenberg in there somewhere.

2) Book accommodation for a wedding we're going to in Italy next year. I've been putting it off as I can't really be arsed and there's been other, more important stuff to pay for, but we might as well get it over with i suppose. I'm hoping for a self-catering place, as it's in Amalfi and the produce there is to die for. Also, cheap.

3) Figure out what I'm doing with the dog for Hogmanay, as we've booked dinner and tickets for a club night. I don't think my usual kennels are open over New Year, so I might be landing him on my parents. At least we got Christmas sorted today, though and I'm not hosting which is a definite bonus.

true,why_am_i_itchy,null,null,"&gt;So if giving the public guns means that criminals get them too, do you have lots of criminals running around with shotguns?

Shotguns are not (legally) available for self defense.
Shotguns are less easily concealed.  
They are for hunting.  
Few people hunt.  
Therefore few people own them, therefore few criminals will be troubled by them.

&gt;As I understand it, an FAC can allow UK citizens to own a shotgun - and many do. 

I think 'many' is an exaggeration.

&gt;Therefore criminals must be armed with plenty of shotguns...?

There are sufficiently few shotguns owned by the public for the vast majority of criminals to not regularly encounter them. Hence the fact that criminals tend not to make use of them themselves.

&gt;If not, why not use the same FAC system for a pistol? 

Pistols are unlikely to be used for hunting.  
Pistols are only likely to be used for crime or self defense.
What you are proposing is to be able to carry a pistol for self defense. 
This raises the issues mentioned in my previous post. 

&gt;Seems like your laws are so strict that they do a good job of keeping the shotguns out of the hands of criminals - why not carry that over to pistols...?

You know what does a better job? A ban. Hence, the ban. I doubt legalizing pistols would prove more effective at keeping pistols away from criminals than a ban.",0,1382924830,null,0,false,0,cd11b02,t3_1pbt8v,t1_cd11b02,t1_cd0wn1z,null,1428959902,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

I didn't mention it before because you were getting angry at people who comment on your appearance, and I didn't want to attract your ire.

This week I would like to:

1) Update my CV and start sending it out to companies. I'm on a temporary contract until Dec 22, and I really don't want to be sacked three days before Christmas. That would suck in a way that even Santa couldn't fix. But applying for jobs is such a shlep, especially when you have to come up with excuses to book time off for interviews from your current employer. There's only so many times you can have a ""plumbing crisis"" before you start to look flaky.

2) Do something about my books. I have many hundreds of them and I live in a tiny flat, so it's about time I did something other than make waist-high piles of them in my living room. The problem is, buying bookcases would be an admission that I'm here for the long haul. This isn't where I pictured myself living, so I need to keep up the pretence that I'm going to move any time now. 

3) Go to bed before 1am and get more than 5 hours of sleep.  I don't think I have for about 20 years, so I'm probably due an early night. Trouble is, going to bed is just so *boring*. There's always something more interesting to do instead. There's always a book or a wikipedia entry to read, or a film to watch, or some fool on reddit who needs to be argued with.

United weren't playing that badly up to that point anyway, having beaten Swansea 4-1 away and getting a point against a strong Chelsea side. Spurs on the other hand had barely squeaked by two poor sides with the aide of a couple of penalties, and had a bunch of players who didn't really know each other.

Not to take anything away from Spurs in general. The next time Arsenal play Spurs I think Spurs will be a much different, and better, proposition. I just think we'll be the strongest test Arsenal would have faced (if we play to our potential) up to that point...so I'm waiting till after that and a couple of more tough matches before I start getting **too** worried about them.

To be honest, I'm trying my best to wait until after we play Arsenal before I start seriously thinking about our potential as well. I'm happy with where we are but up to now this is how I expected us to do.

Same with Sunderland back in 1999-00 and 2000-01. They were 2nd in December 1999 (I remember because my grandad was insanely happy about it and it was the same month I moved to America) and yet struggled in the 2nd half of the season.

I'm not saying I think Southampton will collapse and be in danger of relegation, but teams frequently follow the same pattern and end up in a more predictable position eventually. They've only lost once this season so it'll be interesting to see how they cope if they hit a bad run of a couple of games.

* The inverted winger strategy is notably difficult for some of our players to work with.

* Few attackers are using their positioning (without the ball) to create space, so opposition defense is staying solid. Soldado and Paulinho are the only ones that seem to be trying this.
