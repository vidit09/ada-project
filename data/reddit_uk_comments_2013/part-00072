I have not bought the single, I would not consider myself part of the campaign. This is not my issue. Hating Thatcher is not my issue. My issue is cultural censorship. To not play the song properly is to not recognise the opinions of the many thousands of people who bought it. Opinions just as valid as those who will be mourning in St Pauls on Wednesday.

All you have to do is look at the effect she had on this country; then you must see that this issue isn't just about of playing an offensive song which might upset a few people. This is about the writing of history. If thatcher will be remembered as being good or evil (or most probably somewhere in the middle). The right wing press have been vilifying any attempt to criticise her this week, because its 'disrespectful'.

true,PlayingForTheShirt,,Bangor,"C1 and C2 are still technically intermediate leagues despite a lot of amateur setups but Ards are being investigated into amateur contracts that aren't actually that amateur. Main reason I know this is because two friends of mine are being investigated - haven't heard anything else about it since but hope all goes well as I've a lot of time for Ards FC and would like to see them return.

Didn't know he was on just a one year. I suspected things wouldn't work out for Tim as he just didn't impress in his backroom role at the Glens alongside Young and Batey. It's a shame as I really liked him as a player.

It's tough to come by managers but the Distillery name still carries weight in any division and I'm sure someone will find it an attractive job if they have ambition. Really that's what LDFC need right now from any new manager - someone with ambition and a kick up the arse mentality. 

You do have a good youth system - I've a couple of folk I know (Cooling to namedrop one of them) who have been through it. 

Can I also ask how young Stevie Gordon is getting on? Another shameless namedrop of a friend (gotta love local football!). He's really eager to play for the Glens we sat in the same section in The Oval as kids and would love to see him progress from strength to strength - even if I still tell him everytime I see him that I'm a better footballer than him; for the record I can't namedrop myself, no Irish League team seems to pick up on my talent! :(",0,1365902369,null,0,false,0,c9epf6i,t3_1ca11w,t1_c9epf6i,t1_c9ep12h,null,1431566136,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1

true,Zeeeeeeego,smith,Smith,"In spite of all the negativity towards Series 7B (and maybe even some downvotes), I first like to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the episode.

My opinion as of late is that Moffat, from what I've seen, usually knows the direction he wants to take the story and the show in general. Series 5 began much in the way that Series 7B has. We had Amy introduced as his companion, someone that chose to run away with him as others have done before her and would do after her. The general story arc of the crack in her wall was introduced as well. The plot of the crack was not visited again until Time of the Angels and Flesh and Stone. Before everything was concluded in the final episodes, Moffat slipped in evidence and nods towards the story arc. And during Amy's time, her initial development wasn't very strong. We got the gist, but we did not who Amy truly was or who she would become until she developed over the course of several episodes. 

Clara began as a girl choosing to run away with a madman in a box. In The Snowmen and Bells of Saint John, we were introduced to the arc of The General Intelligence. Since then, it hasn't been touched. Perhaps Moffat has included some hints, but none that I have made notice of. We, as noted by many, are not seeing that much development on Clara's side, but we've seen glimpses and bits of who she is and who she can become. 

As for Series 7A, I can't argue against some of the episodes being rather lackluster and preposterous. I'm not sure what happened there, but I did like Asylum and Power of Three. I think some of the negativity and doubt stems from the fact that Clara is new and we still have to adjust to her after the brutal and rather unimpressive removal of Amy and Rory (however, it still did hit me emotionally). Also, Doctor Who has had many quick resolutions to episodes in the past. There have been some in Clara's arc, and knowing that it's had them in the past doesn't bother me or take away from the story. I don't think it's necesarrily a bad thing, but I don't believe it should be used excessively, and I don't think it has. Lastly, perhaps it stems from some people's self-fulfilling prophecies. When you look for reasons to dislike another episode or be disappointed, by God, will you find it. The reverse is true; if you look for reasons to really love it, you'll find them. There are these behaviors and attitudes support only with the solely relevant information they can find. I have never watched an episode of really anything looking for reasons to like it, love it, hate it, despise it or appraise it. I go in neutral and I don't think there's enough of that going around.

**tl;dr** I thought the episode, and previous ones have been good. Amy developed slowly and her introductory story arc developed slowly as well. Same seems to be happening with Clara. Clara is new, Doctor Who has had quick-resolutions to episodes like ""Cold War"" before, and many people seem to be exhibiting cases of self-fulfilling prophecy.",0,1365902445,null,0,false,0,c9epfzf,t3_1c9y99,t1_c9epfzf,t3_1c9y99,null,1431566122,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

Since this is a British show, characters almost always speak with British accents, of course, but when they portray Russians (who are supposed to be speaking Russian, but speak English so you don't have to have subtitles everywhere), they still have British accents.

The US didn't invade India, they invaded Afghanistan, Iraq (leading to the death of 2.5% of the entire population) and murdered Gaddafi... wait Libya didn't have much of a problem with Islamic extremism until after the invasion? The same with Iraq, internalised violence didn't kick off until 6months after invasion when James Steeles torture militias had been trained. Bin Laden supposedly the worst of all muslims, even if we can believe he wasn't a puppet of the CIA for his entire existence instead of just prior to the 90s but that doesn't matter, said things like the war he is waging is a direct response to US activity in the region:

&gt; God knows it did not cross our minds to attack the towers but after the situation became unbearable and we witnessed the injustice and tyranny of the American-Israeli alliance against our people in Palestine and Lebanon.

* Algeria: various coupes, colonial abuse, then a civil war broke out when the government cancelled elections fearing loss, censored opposition, and the military unleashed themselves on the population. **The violence was political.**
* Somalia: destroyed by colonial fighting up to and during WW2, civil war, abandoned by western forces, the people largely fell back on traditional islamic culture, West is currently drone bombing civilians. **A colonial wreck.**
* Sudan: another British colonial wreck, civil war destroyed the country 1950 with repressed regions demanding political equality, second civil war ~2000 when oil revenues was 70% of export earnings saw tribal groups fought over the lucrative control of the territories. **Violence was economics.**
* Lebanon: they have religious extremists of another kind living next door who have invaded them every decade for 40 years. **Violence is political.**

I could go on.

Remember, the civil wars happened in Europe two to three hundred years ago and there is still animosity in some regions. The places you list haven't had time to settle into democracies and when they do like Iran 1970 which had excellent and enlightened living standards got destroyed by American intervention. The common denominator is war, poverty, inequality, colonial subjugation and active regime change via violence to crush any localised strong nationalism in favour of quasi-proxy states that align closely to the economic interests of the west.

So basically, when I was a kid I got all the shittiness of being an outcast because I was a nerd, but now that I'm an adult, I get shittiness from my own people because they assume I'm not ""one of them"" 'cause of how I look.

I think are weak.  He has been a vocal critic of the religion and its teachings for over a decade, and made books and television shows about it, gone around the world giving talks about it.  Yes, he can have an opinion on Islam still without reading the book, (and it wouldn't necessarily be and inaccurate or misinformed one either), but really?  I mean it's at pretty fundamental element of the religion.  He couldn't take the time to read it?

Barcelona take fewer shots per game than us, but are insanely more clinical. Obviously part of that is down to the difference in quality of players overall, but it also sums up one major area of our attacking play that stills needs a lot of work - patience in decision-making.

Right now, it feels like the team occasionally gets a bit restless or impatient when they pass the ball around and an opening doesn't just 'appear'. You end up with players making silly decisions, e.g. crossing when it isn't on (which is most of the time with the height and positioning of our attacking players), or just blasting shots into defenders from outside the box.

I'm hoping that over time, the team will continue to develop faith in what Rodgers is trying to do, and continue to be happy to hold the ball and work it around, stretching the opposition until openings make themselves available. (Failing that, certain personnel will be moved on for those that are more natural fits for what Rodgers is after).

As for the defensive graph, it again just sums up that keeping the ball is as much a defensive strategy for Rodgers as an attacking one.

Really?

&gt;""With time"". How much time are you talking? It's already been almost an entire season.

That's nothing. We took 18 points from the final 19 games of last season, that's relegation form for half a season. BR didn't exactly inherit the best squad in the league.

&gt;He seems to accept draws that should be wins way too often.

We don't set up for draws and generally we dominate most teams so i'm not sure what you mean by ""accepting"" draws. Poor finishing is a major factor, and it has been for 3 seasons now but we have significantly improved our goalscoring stats this season.

&gt;If there isn't any improvement by the end of next season something needs to happen.

This is obvious. What's also obvious, is we have already improved in certain aspects and regressed in others. More than anything, we just need to be more ruthless - but that's extremely difficult when there's 6 games left and you have [technically] nothing to play for.",0,1365907461,null,0,1365908274,0,c9eqxs5,t3_1c9tus,t1_c9eqxs5,t1_c9enq04,null,1431565418,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2
true,_Sagacious_,num23,,"Hey guys, first post here.

This, for me, is the first season where I'm not desperate for us to make a large number of sales/purchases.

The first thing most Spurs fans are addressing is strikers. Our 2 CFs aren't scoring, CFs are judged on their goals and games are won by them.

But I'm not all that bothered, except for us traditionally being in end-of-season free fall we've played very well this year. Our goals haven't come in the traditional manner but they have come. Adebayor plays a supportive role, he plays with his back to goal and specialises on hold up play, this lets us bring in goal scorers from other positions. Now lets say by some miracle we bring in a Falcao - we won't - a much more capable CF, he will score goals but that will also make him a much more selfish player. That may not be the best thing for our team. All I know is we're playing well now and anything could disturb that.

However, JD, love him as I do, isn't good enough, and the fans have learnt to hate Ade following this season so they're both probably out.

The favourite to come in - on here at least - are Remy and Benteke.

I don't think either are good enough, both play best on the counter, we already have more than enough talent in that area we need a man who's good in a packed box, Benteke looks that type of player but simply isn't. The fact of the matter is that we will never pay for the level of striker we need (20m+)

Ade was great last season playing with Vdv. I think we should pick an AM from Gylfi and Holtby and try and recreate that bond and understanding with Ade. This also moves Bale back out to LW (or at least roots there and plays a free role) which I'd prefer. Obviously right now we need a goal scorer, he scores so put him close to goal, but I think that's only a quick solution.

As for the rest of the squad we finally have good depth for the first time in a long time, although it'd be great to have Townsend back right now. We never know who next will be out for as long as Kaboul or Sandro, so we can't assume we'll have our first team for the majority of the season.

I hope we keep Thudd and Parker, Thudd gives AVB great options and Parker was the crucial piece in seeing out the last 10 minutes of games IMO - the problem we had with the first half of the season.

I still have faith in our full backs and would like us to get behind them rather than us panic and buy.

Also, is 433 what AVB wants, do we know that for sure? I for one prefer 4231. I also believe in the modern game there's so much fluency between all these formations.

Most of all I hope we keep AVB. Even if we lose every game left and finish 6th, I pray we don't.

Second league match against City: we could've either won and been up there with the Manchester clubs or lost and been dragged down into the race for the Champions League spots with the London clubs. We lost and so the tone for the tail of the season was set, forcing us into a mad dash for points.

Last week's episode was one of the best in New Who, and they followed up with this - what I can only call a return to mediocrity. Zero character development, poor pacing, awful plot resolution.

It could have been used as a way to expand on her character, but instead was put in just to throw in a cliche without reason.

That's arguable...no, that's very very arguable. I'm a biased comic book fan though, who detests that portrayal of the Joker. Don't even get me started on his current iteration under Snyder. Still, to say Heaths ""Joker"" and Hannibal are with out emotional characterization is flawed. They were written with like people, deranged and psychopathic people...but still people. 

&gt;So why do aliens need to be humans in silly costumes instead of a completely alien being that cannot be reasoned with by more appeals to emotions?

Because than you have a character that is nothing more than a walking plot device. It does work in some cases, when that's the desired effect you want (see: Alien and The Thing) But with characters who have personality and speak, they need to be written like something more that cardboard cuts outs used to move a story along.

These recent fan ideas almost always *subtract* from her character rather than add to it. It's frustrating seeing theory after theory excitedly pushed forward that are big on out of left field surprise but gut storytelling and character development. They sometimes virtually erase Clara as a character, telling us she's actually someone we already know (the Doctor's daughter, granddaughter, etc.) who hasn't been as developed this season or perhaps any season. No thought goes into where to go from the surprise reveal, what little opportunity this change actually brings, or what effect it would have on the investments already made.

The Cold War existed between the Western world and the USSR because each side felt the other was a threat to their peaceful existence, but because they were more or less equally matched in military capability, particularly with nukes and MAD, they never actually engaged in overt combat.  The Cuban Missle Crisis was simply an extension of that, where the Soviets were going to base nukes in Cuba which was a clear and present threat to the security of the US, but not a cold war in and of itself.

You could argue that North and South Korea are in a cold war as well, but hardly one with global consequences.  Whereas The Cold War was predicated on the idea that both sides could annihilate each other, for North Korea the state of balance is that their regime would effectively be destroyed by a massive overwhelming response if they actually committed an act of war, but not mutually assured destruction.

At any rate, as a plot device, it makes sense to go back to the Cold War if the premise is the ability to destroy the world with a single overt act.  Each side had their finger on the button and was waiting for any excuse to press it.  I don't think it would work as well today as a plot device, the technology and geopolitical realities make it far less likely.

Transcript from Wikipedia for the Video-disabled.

The Doctor lays an unmoving River Song on the floor of the TARDIS, terrified she has been slain in the gunfight. He prepares to give her mouth-to-mouth, but realizes she is only holding her breath with her eyes closed. She gets up to flirt with him. She has escaped from Stormcage and asked some Sontarans if they were out on a hen night, only for them to chase her halfway across the galaxy. As he chastises her, she notices the gold dress he chosen for her for their first visit to Caldoron Beta five years before, hanging near the console. She demands to know whom he has brought and storms up the stairs to find the hussy. A second later, the earlier River returns from the TARDIS wardrobe, demanding to know whom he is talking to. She returns to the wardrobe. The older River returns, demanding to know to whom the Doctor is speaking. When he denies talking to anyone, she resumes her hunt.

A third River enters the TARDIS, actually wearing the gold dress. This version of River was expecting to meet the Doctor here, but on seeing an identical gold dress hung by the console, asks why he has bought another. The Doctor asks her to step outside to check if the light on top of the TARDIS is working. She does.

The youngest River reappears, certain she has heard voices. The Doctor tells her he was talking to himself and she bustles off again. The second River returns to the control room, likewise convinced she heard the Doctor talking to someone. The Doctor brusquely activates her Vortex manipulator to send her back to prison. The third River re-enters the TARDIS. She is followed by a second, older incarnation of the Eleventh Doctor in a tailcoat, who tells her she's in the wrong TARDIS. River is amused at the prospect of two versions of her husband, but as 'her' Doctor ushers her out, she calls back to tell the younger Doctor that she and her Doctor are off to see the Singing Towers of Darillium. The two Doctors share a brief, sad moment, knowing this trip is the last she will see of the Doctor's Eleventh incarnation before she dies in the Library in the Tenth Doctor's presence (""Forest of the Dead"").

As the older Doctor leaves, the youngest River returns to catch a glimpse of them together. She asks him about it but he refuses to tell her, using River's catchphrase, ""Spoilers."" River jokes that his secrets will be the death of her and walks past him. The Doctor pauses to have another sad moment before taking the youngest River on their date.",0,1365916943,null,0,false,0,c9etjdm,t3_1c9y99,t1_c9etjdm,t1_c9ervi2,null,1431564193,13,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,13

On the bright side, I still enjoy Matt as the Doctor, and I'm liking Clara and the mystery surrounding her. Also, I've loved almost every episode Moffat has ever written, so as long as we still get more from him, I'll be happy. (Can't say I liked his Christmas special two years ago, though. Completely forgettable. I don't even remember anything aside from it being very Narnia-inspired.)

Thinking about it now, all of my favorite shows have season-long plots, or a plot running over the course of the entire thing. O_o Huh.

I don't really have much in the way of empathy. My accent is also basically fixed. I grew up in Wales and then spent the last seven years in Scotland. I speak English with a Wiltshire accent. The only place in England I've spent any real time is the Scottish borders.

As such my accent is part of who I am. The idea of intentionally faking another accent just to fit in seems thoroughly unpleasant to me.

I've never experienced my accent changing and as such have no mental reference point for the concept. I have no idea how it works or why people change.

* When cartoons of Mohammed are published we see mass violence with out fail. Can this be said of all religions?

* Why are the vast majority of suicide bombings carried out by Muslims? If you dispute this fact, search ""suicide bombing"" in a news archive and see how difficult it is to find one not perpetrated by a Muslim. The only non-Muslim group that comes close is the LTTE, who have carried out 150, the last in 2009. There have been more suicide bombings carried out by Muslims in the last 9 months than all LTTE suicide bombings combined.

* Aapostasy punishable by death in Islam but not in Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism etc.

* Homosexuality illegal in almost every country where Islam as the state religion, except two.

The is a very common, but logically flawed line of reason, highlighted by [Derek Parfit](http://wikisum.com/w/Parfit:_Reasons_and_persons) in his seminal Reasons and Persons.


&gt;Parfit argues there one can appeal to the act-consequentialist morality even when many people are involved. The following five mistakes are responsible for people concluding that an individual making an altruistic decision with many people involved has made no difference.


Points 3,4 and 5 are relevant.

* The ""Share-of-the-Total view"" where the total good of an outcome is merely distributed in equal parts to the participants.
* ""If some act is right or wrong 'because of its effects', the only relevant effects are the effects of this particular act."" 
* Ignoring very small chances when they either a) affect a large number of people or b) are repeated many times.
* If some act has effects on other people that are [very small], this act cannot be wrong 'because' it has these effects.
* If some act has effects on other people that are imperceptible, this act cannot be wrong 'because' it has these effects.

And remember Redknapp saying he would have to take a pay cut, and his agent said he wouldn't take one. After a bunch of drama, we agreed to a severance package of 5 million on top of his contract. Given that he had two years left on his Man City contract, divide that number by 52*2. That equals an additional 48k a week for two years.

Sam Harris, wrote an entire book about the actions of Christians that doesn't revolve around ""science based"" and philosophical reasoning and criticises Christianity in practical terms in the same fashion that he also criticises Islam.

The only thing that worries me is the BNP and their ilk, is that they may soon have the monopoly on public criticism of Islam if rational critics like Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins are silenced for fear of being called 'racist'.

The attempt at silencing rational criticism of Islam is very dangerous.

At present, serious discussion on Islam is dominated by extremes. Anyone on the middle who tries to open the kind of frank and fair discourse we see about Catholicism and Scientology is decried an ""islamaphobe"" and is thus silenced for fear of being tarred a racist.

Greece, Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden and Finland have all given majorities to far-right parties speaking on platforms primarily focused on immigration and Islam because no one in the middle is seemingly able to talk about it.

The sooner those in the middle like Harris and are allowed the freedom to speak in an honest and measured tone about Islam, the sooner we can take power away from these kind of extremist one-issue parties like the BNP.

true,Agmedal,null,null,"Player of the year: Mata (2nd Cech, 3rd Hazard)

Player that impressed the most: Azpi. More or less cemented his spot, has been solid throughout the season, really went from option to first choice and always puts in a top effort. (2nd Luiz - remember the days when he was always on the verge of either doing something brilliant or totally screwing up? Gained a lot of maturity and put in some great performances including showing versatility by playing well in midfield, as well as showing some real passion when other players seemed to be going through the motions at some points in the season)

Player that didn't live up to their game: Hate to say it, and maybe it's a case of having such high standards, but I'd have to pick Terry as having a quiet season and really looking out of sorts in some games.

Favourite stories of the season: 1st: Essien playing some top quality football on loan at Madrid. Love this guy. 2nd: Lamps' run towards the all time high Chelsea goal-scorer spot. (Will be 1st on my list if he makes it) 3rd: Torres' finding some form and looking hungry towards the end of the season.

Things I'm looking forward to most next season: 1st: Ramires turning into a Makalele-defensive / Lampard-offensive super beast. 2nd: A top class striker coming in and banging in the chances that some combination of Mazacar creates. 3rd: Oscar elevating his game to Mata / Hazard status.

Things I'd love to see but which may or not happen: 1st: The Special One comes home. 2nd: De Bruyne recalled and runs our midfield Ballack-style. 3rd: Lukaku is unleashed. ",0,1365925754,null,0,false,0,c9ev96n,t3_1c9st8,t1_c9ev96n,t3_1c9st8,null,1431563384,4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,4

Bear in mind Saddam caused far more deaths than this during his invasion of Iran (700,000 Iraqis and 300,000 Iranians dead) and the Kurdish genocide (180,000).

The WMD argument was totally invalid the Iraq invasion was also a huge fuck-up, I don't think many would debate that.

Making the tax payer fork out £10million for what is a state funeral in all but name for a divisive partisan political figure who at least a quarter of the country detested. It's a conservative party political broadcast and I'm paying for it. Fuck that! 

No one would be protesting if she was having a private family funeral, far fewer would be protesting if she was having a scaled down memorial service. 

She is getting the biggest funeral of a politician since Winston Churchill. Her 'tribute debate' was many times longer than what he got. Churchill united the country, Thatcher divided it. Churchill helped save us from the Nazis. Thatcher labelled her own country men and women as 'the enemy' and enjoyed helping to destroy communities that did not vote for her party. 

We can argue till Kingdom come about what would have happened anyway and what was her doing - but she's the one who said 'There's no such thing as society' she's the one who militantly opposed any collectivised empowerment of working people and used the police to quash dissent. 


The Tories want to label anyone opposing the conservagasm as 'picketing a funeral' we're all meant to applaud her neo-liberal policies and agree to have her made in to a secular saint because she's dead? No fuck that. I didn't agree with her then and I didn't agree with her now! 

The funeral hasn't happened yet and already people are being attacked for picketing it! Protesting the cut to housing benefits in Trafalgar square is NOT picketing a funeral! Nor is protesting ATOS' involvement in disability assessment. Nor is protesting cuts in State pensions for nurses. And you know what? buying a song from a 1930s musical isn't picketing the funeral either! It may be bad taste but if thousands of people in the privacy of their own homes want to buy and listen to that song that's their business. It's really bloody amusing to hear the erstwhile free-marketers on the right bleat on demanding that the 'socialist' BBC censor the song in the charts. Because when the market produces a result they don't like - that's when it needs regulating?! 

Americans have told me that when Reagan died hardly anyone dared to speak against him or his policies and that history was re-written because of this self imposed censorship. That all the bad stuff he did was swept under the carpet. Do we want the same thing to happen here? Do we want to let one side brand any sort of opposition as 'disrespect?' 

I want Thatcher to have a decent Christian burial and I want her friends and family to be allowed to mourn privately in peace. 

I don't think I'm a terrible person because I object to it costing £10million at a time when vulnerable people are seeing their benefits cut. I don't think I'm a terrible person for thinking we should be allowed to oppose Thatcherite policies publicly at a time when they are being forced down our throats as the holy wisdom of Saint Thatcher. 

I AM SERIOUSLY SICK TO THE BACK TEETH WITH THIS SHIT

Rose, Martha, and Donna all react in ways that I believe normal people would react to meeting the Doctor and exploring time/space.

Amy and now Clara seem to pop right in with minimal reluctance. 

In 'Rose' Rose ends up saving the day, but only by swinging on a chain, nothing as ballsy as standing up to a sun god. She remembers her life back home, and several episodes feature a return to her mom/Mickey, and show her having actual feelings about the life she's left behind. 

Seems like Amy and Clara can't wait to get away, and become far too familiar too quickly. They don't ask too many questions, and are far too accepting of what they are experiencing. 

9/10's Companions were along for the ride, but it feels like Amy and Clara are the ride. Too much story is focused directly around them. 
They are no longer just normal people the Doctor has chosen. Now they are special too. Not that this is a terrible thing, as it has lead to some very interesting episodes, but I hope it isn't the norm here on out. 

I like Clara (certainly more than I liked Amy), she's perky and clever. But anyone that can see a bunch of dismembered bodies without a tear or a gasp, and who are far to eager to step up and take over for a 900 yr old alien genius when the episode climax comes, bother a bit. But it has only been a few episodes. We'll see how this plays out.

true,michaelisnotginger,cnty-scotland,"Scottish-Italian, will deep fry your pizza","Ok again sorry I couldn't reply sooner was at the gf's last night.

1) I do agree that an independent Scotland would (eventually) be part of the EU. However I do not think it would be done, or nearly be done, by the proposed independence date of 2016. The issue of Catalonia is not that the Spanish constitutionally object (btw for an example of how NOT to treat an independence movement see Spain/Catalonia) but that I think that they would make it difficult for Scotland. The EU would like to have Scotland within it certainly but ultimately they can buy their oil on the market and would pay the same whether it's sourced from Venezuela, Norway or Scotland. And if Scotland gets everything it desires - fast-track membership, perpetual retention of the pound etc - that sounds a very positive message to Catalonia, to the Lega Nord, to Corsican separatists, that those nations wish to quell. I seriously think you underestimate the problems Scotland would face.

Also I do think it's ironic. If you think that Scotland and the UK's economic problems are interrelated, surely it's better to be part of a bigger voice so you can elaborate on these problems and help solve them? Why would you be independent when on almost all EU issues (barring the referendum) Scotland and the UK share roughly the same policy, and there is no discernable difference in public opinion in the Eu between the two countries? Wouldn't it become just another union?

3) I think this is the issue the Yes Campaign are most contentious on. Yes the Yes Campaign are pushing for a lower corporation tax to incentivise businesses, but you can see how Ireland's corporation tax annoys the EU, and with the amount of public spending The Yes Campaign are promising, unless they can attract businesses there's going to be a gap between what is possible and probable. According to military friends the Scottish Defence force is simply not feasible on the budget being allocated, because while the amount allocated to Scotland initially seems small, Scotland also benefits from cross-border military spending, expenditure and exercises (BATUS). Again anecdotal but my father works in an engineering business crossing borders with the higher education sector and another EU country. Were Scotland to become independent, they'd have to move or downsize their operation; it's in the contingency planning. Admittedly, anecdotal. 

Scotland currently spends less on public spending true; however public spending in the UK is supposed to drop below 40% by 2017/18 while Scotland's will stay the same or rise under an independent government

Yes I meant interest rates sorry if that wasn't clear. I do think that having differing interest rates to the desires of your economy (ERM, Eurozone) is potentially disastrous. A scottish pound would work but to me keeping the Bank of England is admitting that Scotland's economy does not hugely differ from the UK's.

4) True no one can predict the future. But I would argue that Union is enormously beneficial. It has a lot of things within it (shared borders, culture) that we take for granted. A border, whether physical or mental, is a symbol of exclusion between those countries. Nationalism is inherently about saying that your group are different, culturally, socially whatever to that group. It's why I like the concept of Britishness - I can be Scottish or British. Independence will take that away from me. As for deliberations within the EU, I think a two-track system - with integration for the core unit and an outer tier comprising of trade links (Sweden, Denmark, UK, possibly czech Republic etc) is very possible. But this is all crystal ball.

5) Again you're right that scorched earth policies are in no one's interest. But can you see the discrepancy in Scotland saying it wishes to be free of the UK, partly for economic reasons, yet still wishing to have a say in decision that could affect the UK? I don't think there'd be any appetite for it whatsoever

6) I've already said that I'm glad the Yes Campaign has not gone on about oil for its whole campaign - it's a good sign. However £10bn of an economy that spends roughly £60billion is a large amount. Scotland COULD go independent with or without oil, but accounting for its volatility, especially considering public spending, welfare etc plans would be a massive headache? It adds a huge layer of risk and uncertainty, especially considering the financial commodities supercycle is thought to be coming to an end. 

Here are two very interesting PDFs on oil and the commodity cycle

&gt;  Scotland introduced a smoking ban a year before the rest of the UK, covers the cost of prescriptions... Scotland is almost certainly going to finally try and tackle its alcohol abuse problem (it costs us £3.5bn a year), 

These are things that the UK and the Scottish government both agree on. Same with same-sex marraige. There might be a year or 2 years delay but the policies orientate to the same point. 

&gt;it is aiming for 100% of electricity to come from renewables by 2020 (the current figure is 39%; twice the UK government's target for 2020),

This is partly because of Scotland's superior vantage point for renewables (hydro) but a lot of that is from wind power, which ran at 27% capacity in 2011 iirc and cannot provide baseline power.

&gt; but I think you can already see a difference between Scottish and UK politics.

Currently, yes. In the New labour government there was less of a difference. It is likely that when the recession is finally over that there will be again less difference. If devolution continues as it is going to then I think Scotland can remain under the umbrella of the Uk without having to go independent.

And that's where I think faking it will fall down, dialect, not accent. Not to mention the fact that very few people can speak with an accent other than their own accurately. By all means, if your accent is particularly strong, try to make it a bit more understandable, but this will happen over time anyway. Being American will earn you friendly teasing, pretending to be British will earn you genuine ridicule.

My dad actually did change his accent when he moved to this country; he's from South Africa, white, and it was the 1980s when there was a lot of bad feeling towards South Africa and white South Africans because of apartheid. Ironically, he felt the need to disguise his heritage because people assumed he was racist. Although he has no trace of an South African accent now, it took several years of being completely immersed in British accents to transition fully; it's not something you can learn before you come.

true,not_shakey_byrne,,Leeds - GSXR1000k7 / Duc 996,"I think it's more to do with the age of the pipes and the type of bike. 

In normal use the the ""wadding"" will burn off eventually so very old pipes will have burnt off more than newer ones. 

Some types of bikes and/or modifications make the bike more prone to eating it's wadding. I get the impression that twins are more prone to due to their larger cylinders. For example my 996 is chipped so ""over-fuels"" sometimes when you come off the throttle. The excess unburnt fuel goes into the exhaust catches light off the heat in there and sometimes burns off the wadding with it. If you've been on a hard run and then come off throttle and cruise to lights or something you'll sometimes get pops and bangs out the back - sounds exactly like the traction control you get in WSB - they cut the spark deliberately but it causes the same over-fueling. If you're really abrupt with the throttle you can get a flame - mine has no CAT so other than the wadding its not a problem if you've a CAT this is really bad news. I'm assuming the previous owner had the same thing so the pipes have had a hard life.

For mine i knew they needed done because a) the bike was really loud - even for a ducati. b) When you turned the exhaust upside down you can hear the bits falling from end to end. If you've ever seen a kids ""rain maker"" [0] you'll know what i mean.

My cans are ""Laser"" and even with the wadding problems I've been really pleased with them. My other bike has a Leo Vince corsa system. Its a thing of beauty, a pleasure to work with and sounds incredible with but it cost huge ££££ if it hadnt been on the bike when i got it I'm not sure I could justify the cost.

Her argument was that the government can only act through people, and people must look after themselves first, and their neighbours second. She didn't believe society was a thing in itself, but rather she saw a network of individuals.

This translated into action by the government taking steps to lessen the tax burden and reliance on the state, and allow people to freely meet each-others needs through the market and charity. Whether this was successful is another issue.

true,TheMentalist10,null,null,"Okay. So it sounds like you're going to be spending most of your teaching time on Heslington West, the original campus. You may, on occasion, have cause to visit Hes East, the newer development, whether for moved lectures or social events (such as Live &amp; Loud, the gig during Freshers').

With that in mind, there're lots of people on Hes East, where the general standard of accommodation is higher given how new it is, who 'commute' to main campus every day. It's about a 15 minute walk, and there's a regular, free bus. The campus is increasingly self-sufficient, and the accommodation (Goodricke, for example) is really nice. Something to consider. 

It sounds like you aren't too bothered by having the newest, though, so may priorities other things above that. Without a shadow of a doubt, the nicest accommodation on main campus is in Vanbrugh college and is known as Donald Baron of Barbara Scott Court. These are en-suite rooms arranged in houses on 3 or 4 floors consisting of two 'flats' (corridors) of 6 (typically 3 girls, 3 guys) linked by a massive kitchen in the middle. You're the nearest point on liveable campus towards town, though it's always a walk (I've done it in 12 minutes when rushing, but typically 20), and you're pretty well-placed on campus too (3 minutes from the area considered the campus nucleus, Market Square; 4 from the library; 7 from Derwent, where Politics is based). This is my recommendation as it's where I've spent my first year. 

If you don't want the best, the rest is much of a muchness. Note that being in Derwent won't necessarily mean that you're closer to all our stuff. I'm right next to Philosophy (half of my course), but all my lectures are in Physics, near Central Hall. Some places to avoid: 

- Vanbrugh/Wentworth E is really run-down

- Similarly, James College, N Block needs some work

Other than that, though your non-Barbara Scott/Donald Baron accommodation won't be the prettiest from the outside, it all does the job. If shared bathrooms don't bother you, you'll have a wider range of choices than if you're pursuing the en-suite accommodation. 

In terms of College Spirit, Vanbrugh is geographically and ideologically affiliated with the music department. Derwent is known as the party college, though not for any particularly obvious reason other than the fact that they throw some great events (Big D, Christmas D, [Anything] D). Vanbrugh has Volume, its club night on campus, which is relatively new and rather enjoyable. 

Ultimately, wherever you are, you're not far from everyone else and are sure to find a load of people to visit elsewhere (the only reason I've seen all the accommodation).

Feel free to ask for clarification or more information on any aspect of accommodation or anything else to help with the application process. ",0,1365942273,null,0,false,0,c9ex9pu,t3_1c39qf,t1_c9ex9pu,t1_c9evdop,null,1431562362,2,false,universityofyork,t5_2ss68,2

&gt;STEVEN MOFFAT on THE ICE WARRIORS

&gt;“Oddly enough I slightly resisted them. I was slightly worried. First of all, I don’t think we still have to go into the back catalogue of the old show anymore. Originally we did that to affirm that this new thing really was that old thing. Now that both shows are sort of merged together no one really bothers to make that distinction between them anymore. And I always thought they were slightly rubbery, slow-moving, and you can’t hear what they’re saying – and that’s kind of the archetypal slightly silly monster. But then Mark [Gatiss, writer of episode three], during a phonecall which was meant to be about Sherlock, started pitching me a couple of very, very clever ideas about what we can do with an Ice Warrior, and I went for it at that point. But we were very concerned that the design hasn’t been seen enough to be updated, in a way, so it’s a super-version of the original. Sometimes you think a design should be upgraded because it’s so familiar – that one slightly less so. You will be seeing an Ice Warrior in a familiar form, but with at least one big surprise…”",0,1365943493,null,0,false,0,c9exftw,t3_1c9y99,t1_c9exftw,t1_c9eue7d,null,1431562282,10,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,10

If you find moral equivalence between events 400 years apart you can pretty much justify any act of terror today. Likewise any tract of land can be considered contested. In reality NI can no longer seriously be considered 'contested' since the Republic dropped it's claim.

&gt;How can it be brave for a woman in Britain to order a conflict with a much poorer nation over another relic of colonialism and imperialism thousands of miles away?

Economics are largely irrelevant when you consider the logistical advantage Argentina had over us. The course of the war may have been a few exocet missiles away from a different outcome. Either way the simple fact is the Falklands war was about a claim over land whose people living there did not agree to.

I think it's looking like Derwent or Vanbrugh then. Definitely somewhere on Hes West. What can you tell me about some of the other colleges and their reputations (e.g Alcuin and Halifax,)?

If you don't have any luck getting a ticket for either date, 'add unlisted' on [Scarlet Mist](http://scarletmist.com/) - I've had success in getting sold out tickets on there probably 95% of the time over 30-ish gigs. It's a fan to fan ticket site and often they forget to include the booking and postage charges they've paid, so you'll actually end up getting a ticket for less than you would by buying your own. It's not fail-safe though, of course. 

Warning re the links on Songkick: each ticket company charges reasonably different amounts for their booking and postage fees (including electronic 'postage'!). You should always proceed to the 'check out' stage on ALL available sellers to do a cost comparison before going through with a purchase. They are high in the UK. I think I paid £38 for a £28/30 single ticket last year. 

Shepherd's Bush Empire isn't the greatest. A lot of people complain about the sound there. But it really depends on where you are. If you get a standing ticket and can get close to the front you'll be okay. It's reasonably accessible. The beer is freakin' expensive. 

Don't know about the Manchester venue, I've never been. But look at your train costs, because you can pay vastly varying prices depending on when you book (£30 to hundreds of pounds).

Mmm, that is a bit confusing: Vanbrugh has the nicest bits (Donald Baron/Barbara Scott Courts which are essentially the same place), but then there exists in legend a block called Wentworth E. Nominally attached to Wentworth (the nearby post-grads college) but functionally part of Vanbrugh, it's an evil place. We don't go there.

Halifax is lovely, but also on Hes East, so discount it if you want to be on main campus. Most of the Alcuin accommodation is pretty nice, albeit fairly nondescript. All of the en-suite blocks, at least, are perfectly fine and have good kitchens, but the whole college is a little out of the way for my tastes. Not far, just a little too far for me to bother with. It's the North side of campus, near Economics, Chemistry and the library.

James is like if Alcuin moved into the middle of campus but sacraficed some of its accommodational quality. Parts of it are nice, and you should be able to tell from photos of the different parts which bits to avoid. It's nominally the sports college due to proximity to the main campus sport's centre, but this doesn't mean much at all. James D was my original consideration for first choice.

true,Anotherfuckwit,english,England,"A key industry in Liverpool up until the 1980's was based around the docks. Thousands of people became jobless in the city as a result of the government's lack of support. The knock on effect was disastrous for the whole of Liverpool (and other towns and cities for similar reasons) and there were riots throughout the land. Margaret Thatcher was the orchestrator of the policies which changed the country from being an industrialised nation, leaving millions of labourers out of work and with no hope of becoming re-skilled and finding jobs. Her argument was that it made the country more competitive and richer on the whole.


At the same time and from the previous decade, football (soccer) crowds had a bad reputation as many games were enshrouded by violence as 'fans' from opposing teams used the matches as an excuse to fight with each other and sometimes ruin matches by running onto pitches, etc. England became infamous for football hooliganism. One result of this (that Liverpool fans were directly involved in - Heysel) was that English teams were banned from playing in European competitions, another was that grounds around the country fitted high iron fences that segregated and caged fans so that they couldn't 'escape'. 

At one match at Hillsborough in Sheffield, a cup semi-final, between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, Liverpool fans began spilling onto the pitch, which at first seemed strange as they were fenced in. TV pundits commented on the 'typically appalling' behaviour of Liverpool fans and then, as the story began to unfold, we witnessed on our screens the deaths of many people, young and old as they became crushed against the fences by crowds of fans apparently still fighting to get into the ground.


Following the police reports that thousands of Liverpool hooligans and yobs turned up without tickets and forced their way through barriers, the National outrage was swift and divisive. Whilst many people, including Margaret Thatcher's government were damning in their vitriol towards Liverpool and football fans in general, others were distraught with grief as we discovered that the people who died were normal, everyday people, children, grandparents and so on. A Liverpool fan based organisation began to question the official version of events from that day as the accounts given didn't seem to add up. Margaret Thatcher's government were not interested.


A few months ago, after years of campaigning, the official documents surrounding the disaster were released. It turns out that the police and crowd management systems were entirely to blame - there were no drunken hooligans, no ""thousands without tickets"", merely an ageing turnstile system that couldn't cope and a police decision to open a large gate herding thousands of fans, all at once into a tunnel heading to a dead end, literally. The report shows how senior police officers lied and and actually changed the written statements of junior officers to purposefully transfer blame from themselves to Liverpool fans. And most of the country believed them.


In death, Margaret Thatcher has, once again, divided the country. Many wish to celebrate her life and her accomplishments, turning an tired, labour driven country into a global player in stock markets and a world leader in capitalism. Others are celebrating the death of a leader whose policies drove many into poverty and whose 'iron' will meant she would ignore the collateral damage her right wing policies created. By coincidence, her death occurred the before the anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster. Whilst some clubs are holding a minute's silence out of respect for her, The Liverpool fans are making it clear, their remembrance is for their families and loved ones who died.

I could go on but you'd just get bored and I would offend SOO many people so ill stop there.

A few people have suggested I'm trying to link thatcher to the cause of the incident. No, to link Thatcher to the banners in the picture. That's all.

true,v1s1onsofjohanna,null,null,"I'm just so amazed at the dislike for Rings of Akhaten and even more surprised by the love of Cold War. Akhaten had such a warm, human core to the story. And Clara really shined with her compassion and ambition throughout the episode.

Meanwhile, Cold War was a simple story of an intelligent but at the same time terrifying monster that wants to go toe-to-toe with a human military unit because of the human instinct to kill things of the unknown with the Doctor stuck between them. The story is, if I may say, the most tired plot device in all of Doctor Who. It's not even unique to this Doctor. (Silurians anyone?) It seems a lot of people got enjoyment from the professor character. I found him somewhat amusing but not nearly to the same degree as others. Maybe because I didn't recognize his cameo appearance.

I don't know. I found the world of Akhaten interesting and thought-provoking. I mean, psychic currency? Only things of true sentimental value? So cool! And its story was simple in scope but all the more moving. I admit, the singing scenes while seemingly cheap and manipulative to some, was very effective on me. One might ask how the destruction of a god the size of a planet by ""THE. MOST. IMPORTANT. LEAF. IN. HUMAN. HISTORY."" is simple in scope. Well, it's really the message that's simple. It was all something a person could digest and identify on a personal level. Cold War's message? A ham-fisted cold war metaphor that if parsed and sanitized to any sort of abstract idea would just be the fragmented sentence ""Understanding."" or ""Tolerance.""

The move to the black didn't come until after Blair was elected (although it was thanks to Ken Clark this was possible). Overall the deficit in New Labour years pre-2007 was comparable to that in the the Tory years. In this time the privatization and centralization that Thatcher and Major started, Blair and Brown turned into a art. It only went wrong when the deregulated banks (a work of Lady T) collapsed.

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"There was a wide scale cover up, not just police witness statements but also paramedic statements were changed. Some statements were changed by senior police officers without any apparent knowledge of the front line police who'd given them in the first place. Those campaigning for justice allege that the documents released in the latest enquiry were incomplete and they are demanding to see Margaret Thatcher's correspondence on the issue. 

Further more, Sir Norman Bettison, who was in charge of South Yorkshire police at the time, was required by his force to resign recently to avoid the embarrassment of independent police commission investigation. He is still being personally investigated by independent body and he is facing a gross misconduct charge. 

He's a contender for most corrupt British police officer ever http://www.upsd.co.uk/sir-norman-bettison/ linked to scandal, after scandal, after scandal... 

Let's be clear, even before Hillsborough this man's shit stank to high heaven. Cases he was meant to be investigating just 'disappeared' thanks to his hard handed tactics in dealing with strikes he's linked to unexplained deaths.. if Hillsborough had been investigated a lot would have come to light, a LOT of people had an interest in this man not being investigated. 

The day after the disaster Thatcher visited him, they had discussions, notes were made - then the cover up happened.

Either Thatcher was complicit or she was negligent, simply arranging a decent inquiry would have exposed many of the falsified documents and other areas of corruption with the force. There are police officers who only found out last year that their statements were altered because no one bothered to check with them. It is the responsibility of parliament to police the police. This was a major disaster and it is normal procedure in such circumstances for full, independent inquiries to be launched. The delay in beginning the inquiry, conveniently waiting until Thatcher was nearly dead, is in itself suspicious. 

Even in 2011 the Information Commissioner said that the documents showing Thatcher's correspondence on the matter ought to be released. More than a year later they still haven't been.

You don't get £6 million and chuck it in your natwest current account. If you don't understand the reasons why, then thats at least part of the reason why you don't have £6 million to your name.

People who earn monthly PAYE earnings might get up to ~£150K per year at the top end. Individuals earning beyond that though aren't doing your normal 9-5 jobs and aren't paid in a straightforward way. Partly this is probably to exploit the tax system, but I expect its also partly just a consequence of the fact that someone so uniquely indispensible enough to earn that kind of cash, is likely to earn it in a non-conventional way.

Thatcher is a great example, since she spent most of her retirement giving speeches in the US for tens of thousands of pounds a time. People paid her to do an honest job - she bought a house with it and arranged her money to minimise her tax liabilities. It's no different to the software engineer with a Ltd. company who writes off his car against VAT as a buisness expense. Only an idiot would pay more tax than they have to - it isn't against the law.

Whilst on one level I suppose it's not that different to the multinationals who abuse the corporation tax system. But the fault ultimately has to rest with governments for failing to enforce proper taxation by passing laws that close convoluted loop-holes... and indeed governments are clamping down on it.

Heck in The Snowmen the Doctor even gives G.I. the idea for the plot in Web of Fear.  you can even follow the whole ""Web"" theme too.  for some reason G.I. really likes snow and webs.  Bells of Saint John is the G.I.'s attempt, yet again, to control using a ""web"" the internet, the world wide web.  

In 1995 there was a direct to video production called ""DownTime"" think of it like Torchwood prior to torchwood.  Elements from Doctor Who without the doctor in it.  the Great Intelligence made a fourth attempt to conquer the earth by trying to get into every machine and being on the planet.   the whole planet cocooned in web which was one mass of thoughts in one global body.  Sound familiar? For whatever reason the Great Intelligence...for being so ""smart"" does tend to use the same themes over and over again. even attempting the exact same plan twice.  

What i'm trying to get at is for being called the Great Intelligence he's really not that smart.  In the Doctors 2nd regeneration he used the Yeti's twice.  Yeti's in the snowy mountains...yeah that made sense.  but utilizing them again in London? seemed really out of place and it's even noted in the episode. the Great Intelligence is just really into using the same things multiple times.  putting a different spin on the same plan.

true,nannyplum,null,null,"Thatcher has been dead a long time in terms of politics. As an individual, she was ousted by the Conservatives and that was pretty much the end of her. 

Am I celebrating her death? Not really. I mean, OK. I hated her. I hated the Tory party of the 1980s. Hell no, actually I just hated the 80s. 

I still live on the crappy council estate I was brought up on as a child. This ex-mining/steel community was decimated by Laissez-faire economics and the destruction of state-run infrastructure. All our industry was taken away, and never replaced. We have people here that have remained stagnant and unemployed for almost 30 years. They have had families of their own who see the only way of ‘getting on’ is to leave home in early adulthood, become underemployed or unemployed, have children, obtain a flat and carry the cycle on. It’s not their fault. The seeds were sown for this back when we were encouraged by the Thatcher government to abandon the idea of ‘Society’ and just look after number one. Our local School failed my generation miserably, and was closed down almost a decade ago. 

The New Labour government and the Welsh Assembly tried hard to ‘regenerate’ the area. However, doing up some houses, installing a park and having fancy new shop fronts didn’t give people the desperate job-boost they needed. This isn’t just Wales. This is UK wide and repeated everywhere. I'm sad for small towns and people forgotten in the quest for bigger investment in overseas imports and the banking sector. She introduced aggressive capitalism to this country. I don’t believe that that philosophy benefits everyone. Just a few. 

So I’m not ‘Partying’ over her death. But I won’t shed a tear for the person who was responsible for so much social decline, and the fattening up of the already rich banking and business community. 

I’m probably talking shit though. I’m not the best educated person here. I’m just going by what I can see around me, out of my window right now. It's no wonder people around here are having all-night parties in celebration. They have long memories and those scars run quite deep.

true,elduderino1981,null,null,"Who was your first Doctor - when did you start watching?

Seventh, Sylvester McCoy. I was 7/8 when I started watching, the last two series before it was cancelled. Being so young I'm sure there was lots I didn't understand but remember loving McCoy's portrayal and being quite scared of the monsters/aliens. Re-watching the episodes years later the special effects are extremely dated but Sylvester McCoy still impresses me, his version of the Doctor was quite whimsical and had some interesting eccentricities. There's a distinct mad professor vibe to him, it made sense to me that his companion Ace would refer to him as ""professor"".


Do you have a favourite Doctor?

Fourth, Tom Baker. He had the largest personality, could go from manic grin to intense brooding within the same scene. His delivery combined with that large frame and the outfit with that famous scarf make him the most impressive to me.


Favourite/least favourite episode(s)?
City Of Death is brilliant, classic fourth Doctor episode written by Douglas Adams. The early Stephen Moffat episodes are among my favourites since the revival, Blink probably being the best.

Least favourite, Logopolis was a poor way for Tom Baker to leave the show. Castrovalva was also a very weak story for Peter Davison to be introduced as the fourth Doctor.

I'm also not a huge fan of the First Doctor episodes I've seen, apart from the first Dalek episode. William Hartnell's Doctor doesn't have much appeal to me, the crotchety old man on screen always seemed too frail and weak compared to his later incarnations. Admittedly the production values back in the 1960s were extremely low, combined with most scenes shot in one take, it is maybe a bit harsh to compare the First doctor to later ones.


Favourite companion?

I have a soft spot for Ace as she was the Seventh's companion when I started watching as a child. I need to see more of Romana, her second incarnation in City Of Death had a wonderful chemistry with the Fourth Doctor. Since the revival, Rory is probably my favourite, I would have loved his father played by Mark Williams to have become a semi-regular companion but it looks like that ship has sailed.


Favourite enemy?

Daleks from the old series, I don't think they've quite got them right in recent years. Since the revival the Weeping Angels.


Is there a Doctor that you would say goes under-appreciated or underrated?

Colin Baker as the Sixth Doctor is underrated. His portrayal was incredibly brave, making his Doctor initially an arrogant, smug, stubborn and rude character did not go down well at the time. I find him fascinating to watch as he's throwing childish tantrums and patronising his companion, while underneath the bravado he is still the same brilliant timelord. The plan was for the Sixth Doctor to have at least five years in this incarnation to allow for plenty of character development, it's somewhat of a shame that Baker only lasted two years before being the only actor to be fired from the role.

Peter Davison doesn't get mentioned a lot either as a favourite, he had a much more grounded and human approach to his version of the Doctor compared to his predecessor Tom Baker. Davison's vulnerability and sensitivity is best encapsulated in his final story The Caves of Androzani where he sacrifices himself to save his companion Peri


Do you think that Doctor Who should have been cancelled back in the 80s?

Doctor Who was not treated with the respect it deserved during the 1980s, the firing of Colin Baker, the 18 month hiatus in 1985/86. It became inevitable as US imports and contemporary films showed up the lack of budget and relatively poor special effects of Doctor Who. Ratings kept dropping until they were so low at the end of the last Seventh Doctor series in 1989 that something had to give.


What did you think of the Paul McGann Doctor Who film?

It was a fairly rotten attempt at retooling the show for an American audience. Far too many guns, the half human nature of the Eighth Doctor, his compnaion/love interest and the preposterous chase scene made it one of the more embarrassing entries into the canon. It's a shame it turned out the way it did as Paul McGann had the potential to be really good in the role.


How did you feel when you discovered Doctor Who would be coming back to the screens in 2005?

Excited and nervous that it wouldn't work after the disastrous TV movie.


Do you think that the new version ties in well with the old ones?

I think the writers have done very well to maintain consistency with older series. There are many characters/enemies that have been brought back with great care/respect given to their original incarnations. Sarah Jane, K-9 and the first Dalek episode would be very good examples of this.


Have you met any of the cast, production team or writers? What were they like?

Nope


How long do you think Doctor Who will run/how long would you like it to run for?

It should run for as long as the BBC, no reason why it shouldn't if it's treated well by the people in charge and public tastes don't change too much. It has the perfect format for a scripted show, the main character is an alien who can travel anywhere in space or time and can survive a change in actor by transforming into a new incarnation. 


What do you think of Steven Moffat's era compared to Russell T Davies'?

Russel T Davies did a fantastic job bringing the show back and making it as popular as it became. While Davies' era might have relied a bit too heavily on emotional manipulation for my tastes, Moffat's more complex plots and fast paced shows appeal to me more.


What do you think that the 50th anniversary means for British culture and television?

It's extremely impressive for a show to have run for that long, albeit with a bit of a break in the 90s. It's something to be proud of.


Are you excited about the 50th anniversary, do you know much about the episode?

Looking forward to it. I've heard David Tennant and Billie piper are confirmed, Ecclestone is definitely out. I've also hear that all eleven Doctors will be featured somehow.

And then you get the people saying ""Oh haha look at the crazy Turks at it again"" when some ridiculous thing comes along, but not realising some of them are dangerous. Gala fans are even worse than Millwall fans who get more stick than a forest from those wankers! I mean everyone on /r/soccer shits themselves when there are homophobic or racist chants from an English team (NOT AT ALL SAYING ITS OK) but then when Gala fans or some non-UK club go start a massive brawl and raid a TV station it's all THE PASSION!!!! 

Just a double standard I guess, and I am not way saying it's in anyway OK for Millscum and other english clubs to do offensive chants, just saying that the people over at /r/soccer seem to have a stupid double standard about UK fans and non-UK fans.

I'm assuming you mean Aramaic not Amharic. There is no Aramaic Bible as such aside from later translations, there a few verses in the Hebrew Bible written in Aramaic, but the percentage is very small. People get confused by films like Passion of the Christ which depict Jesus speaking Aramaic and asume that the New Testament must have been written in Aramaic too, which is wrong. A coloquial Aramaic was the English of that area of the world serving as a common language for speakers of Ge'ez, Sabaean and Hebrew etc, but all scholarly work was carried out in Hebrew. The majority of the original version of the Bible was written in Hebrew, so it's probably worth asking if he's read that version of the Bible than any version that may have been translated into Aramaic at some later point.

Richard Dawkins has professed his admiration for the prose of the King James Bible, so at the very least that version.

This question however does demonstrate why Dawkins and Harris etc. will probably never read the Qu'ran. Because as soon as you read a holy book, people will move the goalposts and say it isn't good enough. ""...but what version.""

Furthermore, whilst Ivanovic has his days, he was poor today, especially on his marking for Aguero's 2nd. Definitely not good enough for central defence, Terry would've been the better option.

Finally, Azpilicueta. I had my initial doubts over him then some good form turned it around. However, he is definitely not the long-term solution. Arguably our worst player today and City's best. He was absolutely shocking and I'm embarrassed for him. Wasteful, weak and absolutely shit.

true,lemonmylyman,1953,,"Woof.

* Mikel and Ramires must get very annoyed. Whenever Mata/Oscar/Hazard forget to track their wingers, these two have to push wide, opening up a lot of space in the middle, where Yaya and Barry get to roam around free due to the AM not doing his defensive duties. Defensively, the transition from offence to defence is so poor in this 4-2-3-1 that we will be punished by responsible wingers and box-to-box midfielders (Yaya).

* Bertrand must immediately be loaned out to a German team for a year so he can learn how to use the ball in the most effective manner.

* Dave had a bad game. He sometimes struggles against the best players defensively, but that could also be because the winger falls asleep. With better offensive full backs today we could have created more in the last 10 minutes.

* Offensively the biggest concern should be the lack of proper chances. The last 20 minutes had some lovely Hazard play once or twice, but we didn't actually create anything massive except the Hazard-dance-come-Ba-shot. It was a lot of running, a lot of passing across the box, and a bunch of overhit crosses. Throw in a few inaccurate long-passes from the back and you can understand why it was more frustrating to see our futility when City looked a bit rocked by the 2-man attack.

* I was surprised at the lack of substitutes in the final 10 minutes. After our goal, we had 5-7 minutes when we looked semi-dangerous (i.e. Hazard drank a concoction of energy drinks and everyone got excited), but then we kind of fell through again. I was hoping for one of Moses/Lampard for Dave/Oscar. Just to give us an extra lift when we struggled to figure the Lescott substitution. If not that, throw up Ivanovic and Luiz to battle. Did Benitez not see Dortmund vs. Malaga? That shit works.

Conclusion: We lost because we can't turn possession into chances, no matter how many passes across the box we try. Oh, and our full backs didn't perform.

true,Rozo-D,mccoy,McCoy,"The episode where he leaves Susan is ""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"".  basically the Daleks mess up London in the 22nd century and Susan falls for David, a freedom fighter.  Instead of the Doctor allowing Susan to choose to either stay with David or continue on with him in the TARDIS he locked her out of the TARDIS and left.  She's crying and pounding on the door to be let back in but he just leaves saying he'd return one day.  Which takes awhile.  She doesn't meet him again until his 5th regeneration.  

However depending of if you take this as canon or not but she did spend a lot of time with the 8th Doctor.  In the Audio plays she's with him a lot (audio is pretty much canon really).  Also in the book Legacy of the Daleks the 8th Doctor goes back to where he originally left susan.  they have an encounter with the Master and Susan ends up taking the Masters TARDIS.  therefore, technically, she must currently have access to a TARDIS.  

EDIT: on a side note folks should really read the books (they're quite good and actually explain a hell of a lot) The 8th Doctor did A LOT and during his 8th regeneration it explains more about his family.  It's a spotty history and it's kind of muddled but the Doctor is one of about 40 cousins created by the Loom on Gallifrey in the house of Lungbarrow.  He goes back in his 7th form to visit his family who have pretty much disowned him at this point.  It's believe his Father was a renegade time lord named Ulysses and (this is very much open for debate) his mother was a human named Penelope Gate from 19th century earth.  Thus the reason why the 8th Doctor says he's half human (again though, rule #1).  He's been married several times and has quite the extended family.  brothers, sisters, sons and daughters.  in his 8th form he adopted a girl and raised her until she was a teenager.  she was also a Time Lord.  He had great grandchildren because the girl he raised also had a daughter and Susan has a few kids.  It's quite a hard history to follow as he's never truly honest and you really have to piece it together via small hints he's dropped in the tv show as well as the books and comics.  in the episodes tomb of the cybermen and curse of fenric he states that most of his family has died or, and this is key, ""gone missing"" e.g. susan.  It's never been stated exactly if Susan is dead and many believe she is not.  Remember she may or may not have access to a TARDIS but we haven't heard from her in a very long time.  Her children really aren't time lords as they only have one heart.  She asked the Doctor if one of her sons could study on Gallifrey and he doubted it possible since her son only had one heart.

Every time we got a new manager after Rafa was more or less adding 2 seasons' time/work/growing/learning to realistically(for sure, no joke) challenge top 4 and maybe title if something miraculous happened.

Before one gets foaming at the mouth and racking their brain over stats and what teams can hop us and all that, you gotta realize we are fielding a relatively new team. We basically have been every season since Rafa left. Liverpool has been all over the place in terms of formations, tactics, etc these past seasons.

I'm not necessarily saying its impossible for a team(that hasn't been in top 4 challenging shape) to challenge top 4 and take one of the spots at the end of a season. Perfect example was Newcastle's run last year where they held a decent position in ranks for a team that was 12th the year before and newly promoted. But as you can obviously see, it's a different story for them this year.

I think Rodgers's practices and ways of running things are major steps in the right direction. Give him more time to build up and get the kinks out and I think we could be a lot more consistent.

It may be difficult for people who recently started watching Liverpool to understand all this since one might be puzzled how Liverpool went from years of back to back securing of a top 4 spot/being called one of the Big Four, to a team that has fallen spaces below fourth.

Having the ability to field the similar formations and teams for consecutive seasons is more or less the way Liverpool needs to get back into competitive shape. I don't think there's any tycoons ready take over and pump our transfer budget to a huge sum. We're going to have to do it the proper way.

Whenever we get a new manager, things require a fair amount of time. Liverpool right now is still growing and not all there yet. Don't focus on little stats and theoretically getting 5th. If we get it, we get it;if not oh well, we're still working on things. 

**TL DR** It will take some time to get back into the shape we were in oh say 08/09 and earlier. Smart investment, consistency and logic in choosing sides, and just grinding things out til something clicks is what we need.

Remember Liverpool's teams have been extremely different every season since Rafa left. We need time.

Of course, the football membership scheme was just one of the loony toon schemes that got her defenestrated a little later.

Just because some people behave distastefully, doesn't mean she wasn't incredibly corrupt, and that they have no reason for jeering her. Just consider, for one, what she did directly to the families of those killed in Hillsborough. She gave the green light for them to be viciously slandered by the official institutions of the country, to be mocked and jeered at in public, so that it took nearly 25 years for their names to be cleared! She grossly abused the power of her position. Grossly. She knew all that disgusting truth of what went on, and she piled huge pressure on the innocent for her own gain. She knew this put the Police firmly in her corner - so what did the truth matter?

A disgusting and corrupt person. You might want to demonstrate your higher principles in this, but do not mistake the anger as unjustified, and if you are so prettily concerned with ""evidence-based solutions"" and your (self-percieved) lovely sense of fair play, perhaps you might actually read some of the many, many articles written in which her corruption is detailed.

I think it's important you don't just sound sonorously independent-minded and judicial about this - so why not google a few things and actually read the evidence of how fucking corrupt she was. It's not a conspiracy, it's all there in writing, and in peoples' memories.

I felt like the ending of Cold War, leaving them to circumnavigate the globe to get to the Tardis, was like a call to the audience saying ""Pay attention, you might miss something important."" (The next episode will assume you watched the last)

That being said, Moffat has written in certain themes in the stories featuring Clara...

* Matter can remember/have a will (The Snowmen)
* People can be controlled and ""downloaded"" remotely by things unseen (Bells of St John: Wifi possession)
* Memories have significance (Ahkaten: A culture whose currency is based on sentimental value and a star who feeds on ""stories."" Clara saves the day by doing the opposite of the doctor; instead of recanting her life story, she calls on the significance of everything that doesnt happen, the infinity of variations that, by chance, we dont experience.)
* Self sacrifice/martyrdom is sometimes necessary, but recalling your best memories can dissolve any bad situation if you let them (Cold War: The Doctor comes real close to blowing everyone up in the sub to prevent war, but it's Clara who clears the air when she made Skaldak remember a time when his family was alive, which makes this the second time Clara has saved the day using the power of memories.) 


The whole memory theme is a favorite of Moffats. The Doctor was called back into existence when Amy remembered him, The Silence are ""memory proof"", and The Doctor restarted his relationship with the universe by deleting himself from every database. I wouldnt be surprised if Clara is simply a memory of her first self, diffused and repeated throughout time somehow. The way Cold War emphasized how she felt about death before showing The Doctor willing to martyr himself and everyone else could be foreshadowing the future death of Clara, which could be such a sci-fi clusterfuck that her death results in a ripple of Clara reincarnations throughout time (the infinity of days that we dont experience, harking back to Ahkaten), with her last words being ""Run you clever boy, and remember."" (also harking back to Ahkaten, when The Doctor tells Clara ""we never walk away"", but then tells her that when theres danger ""Run like hell."" I'm guessing Clara will end up saving The Doctor somehow. She will stay, and Doctor will be forced to run. Much like the ending in AOTD)



Even if I'm right, no one is going to be able to say how it is until that episode is released. This medium has extremely loose standards for what qualifies as psuedo-science , so Moffat could write it in that Clara is somehow the product of a future regeneration throwing a carrot into the time vortex and we'd still buy it.




But now I must stop procrastinating, and go type the 10 page paper on how Doctor Faustus reflects the after effects of The English Reformation, which I havent started, and is due in 20 hours.

But from a narrative standpoint having a companion from the past is really difficult to do.  

First of all there's the vernacular.  Clara Poppins would only be able to make references/understand references from Victorian times.  

That leads into the learning curve of not only having to explain the complex timey-wimey stuff, but also basic 21 century technology as well.  

And then there's the spoilers.  I mean, there's always spoilers when he takes a companion into the future, but this just seems different. Like taking Amy to Starship UK seems a lot different than taking Clara Poppins to a soviet sub in the 80's. With that kind of knowledge Clara could really do some damage in her own time (Not that I think she would)[Spoiler](#s ""Sort of like Adam in The Long Game"").

That means, too, that she'd never be able to go back to her own time.  Taking Amy and Rory into the far flung future wouldn't do too much damage because the stuff they see is so strange and unbelievable that it wouldn't be too bad whereas Clara Poppins with knowledge of anything within the next 200 years would really screw things up.

Clara saves the Doctor while giving him a cathartic moment to forgive himself (something each of her past lives has done by allowing him to move past the Time War, or at least the Daleks, and by allowing him to move past Amy &amp; Rory by getting him back into the hero game).

It wasn't just some throw-away line. It wasn't just fan-service. It had a very real point. These episodes may all be ""standalone"" but Moffat is clearly building to something BIG with Clara and her effect on the Doctor.

EDIT: Forgot to mention that one of the major points of him mentioning his granddaughter was to show that he was losing at his own game. He believed Clara to be ""impossible.""

Under Thatcher 

My grandma had to teach my the three Rs because I was in a class with 60 students and didn't get teaching time. I remember spending lessons helping to sellotape old books back together because the school couldn't afford new ones.

Instead those affected spent the next 25 years in, essentially, a hunt to dish out blame. Instead of accepting that no-one being in ""the wrong"" would make a blind bit of difference to anyone, they spent right up until last year or so relentlessly and obsessively chasing their white whale.

It's sad, it's pointless, it makes no difference whatsoever, and people have wasted their lives and never really gotten over the deaths of their loved ones because instead of saying ""let it go, move on, live your life"" those around them and indeed the entire city decided to make this out as if it was some essential cause which everything rested on. It wasn't, it isn't, it couldn't have been.

Hillbourough resulted in two tragedies.

Although I have, in fairness, seen relatively little of them I think that it's quite clear why Warnock has represented England and Drury hasn't. Warnock simply has more to him: pace (though that may not last for much longer), set piece delivery, the ability to bomb forward and a long throw.

Drury doesn't really have any of those, but I don't remember him setting a foot wrong yesterday. He's the kind of full back you can tell to never pass the half-way line and be happy in the knowledge that he will hold his own, as his positioning is pretty good. There were a few times when an impetuous player would have gambled on a 50/50 ball and left his wing open (Byram did it once or twice in the first half), but Drury just kept backpedaling and not letting them run down his wing. On the other hand, he's reluctant to take the ball too far forward and his crossing is poor.

I do feel sorry for Drury, because he was a far better option at left-back than Peltier but he still got overlooked, then got injured when Warnock had to use him, which led to the signing of Stephen Warnock. He's been the invisible man ever since. He's the only signing that Neil Warnock seemed to have something against, and I'm not sure why - it must have been a problem behind closed doors.

true,worotan,null,null,"She covered up the devastating criticism of the Police. Whatever I think of your excuse for her for allowing a public body to lie to the public in the self-interest of those currently serving, you cannot ignore that Thatcher gave the official seal to the lie that the fans were to blame, not the Police.

She was more prepared to believe anecdotal evidence than a clear official report. Whether you think this was just casualness rather than corrupt collusion with the Police who had helped her crush her opponents, I am amazed that you can deny that she covered up the truth. Do you prefer 'concealed?' She was told privately that it was the Polices fault. She publicly, and repeatedly, blamed the fans. When that comes from the top, it impresses people, as they all knew.

She didn't have to say that she was happy that the Police 'were shit.' She had to act on the report for the good of the British public, and root out the corruption she had been informed about. She didn't - she promoted the ring-leaders, while those that tried to tell the truth were harassed and bullied into misery so that people would feel disgust at them, not solidarity with them. Maybe this too is a partial version of what happened, but it is a version that has been accepted even by the Policeman who 'allegedly' set up the whole frame-up.

&gt; The thing is, that link is, if anything, more sympathetic to Thatcher, as it directly states that the government saying ""it was due to drunkenness"" was not out of a desire for a cover up but because they themselves had been informed so.

You're quite disingenuous about this. Did you really not see that the people who had told her this, were the ones that the independent report said had been at fault? If she still preferred their anecdotal and partial anecdotes over an independent official report, then she is not being shown in a more sympathetic light. What planet do you come from? She was told lies and preferred them PUBLICLY to the truth that she accepted PRIVATELY from an independent report. From that point, she took part in the cover-up, telling lies that were expedient. She had been clearly told what had happened; she wasn't prepared to allow that information to be made public, and stopped her Home Secretary from doing so. What part of that do you think is inaccurate, or sympathetic to the idea that she wasn't trying to stop the truth from reaching the public?

You might think it is better that the Police should not be criticised for mistakes that led to 96 people dying, and that the man in charge of making the gross and stupid mistakes that led to those deaths should be promoted to one of the highest positions in the Police over the heads of competent Policemen and women, but it does not alter that it was covered up, and that the cover-up was condoned and given public backing by the Prime Minister.

&gt; I personally had never heard that Thatcher had been implicated in a cover up

You've just read two reports about her handwritten note which allowed the truth to be 'not spoken about' - if you don't like the term cover-up - and yet you still don't think it's possible? You see, they all did a good job of muddying the truth all those years ago, adding some doubt to peoples minds. If you are still unconvinced, use your initiative and do some reading. There

&gt;  and I still haven't.

Yes, you have. You've just been shown evidence, you just choose to interpret it bizarrely. I mean, saying that the suppression of the evidence that the Police were at fault rather than the public, was because the government didn't want to criticise the Police, and just wanted to say that they were happy that the report had been properly conducted, is the whole point! What is that if it's not a cover-up? No-one lies, they just don't mention the relevant evidence and encourage everyone to look in the wrong direction by blaming the public.

You are never going to get a video of Margaret Thatcher confessing to this. But you have read that she was concerned that the ""broad thrust"" of the report constituted a ""devastating criticism of the police"". That criticism was only officially revealed 20 years later.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"We have had a couple of stupid moments in recent years, the most notable being the moron who got on the pitch and slapped Chris Kirkland. Aside from that, my only memories of brainless behaviour from Leeds fans involve Millwall, which can be put down to attracting people who aren't real fans but show up in the hope of starting or finishing some trouble.

The first was in the Play-Off Semi-Final, when Becchio scored *that* goal, which prompted some Leeds fans to get a bit overexcited and jump over the advertisement hoardings to celebrate on the pitch, which I think was something of a retaliation for the Millwall fans doing the same thing (only in much greater number) during the away leg.

The second was also a Millwall game, this time a league fixture (I couldn't say for sure which season, but it was after 07/08 ). I was in the car park closest to the store after the game, and as I listened to Yorkshire Radio in the car there was suddenly a flurry of activity. People past around me, heading to the road behind my car; youths jumped over the nearby fence, and chants of ""Scum! Scum! Scum!"" filled the air before eventually the police rode in on their horses and broke it up (at this point people were running back the way they came from - including going over the same fence). I don't know what actually happened, as my curiousity did not outweigh my desire to remain safe. My guess is that it was just the Millwall coaches leaving the ground and some people were just feeling like making trouble. I should add that I have **never** witnessed anything like that before or since at Elland Road, so it really was a freak incident.

On the other hand, I have other experiences that counter the above. For example, away fans are often allowed to walk around Elland Road in their own colours; no one minds if they go into the store or park in car parks around the ground. That includes Arsenal, Oldham, Hull and Huddersfield fans. I've never seen one harassed by a Leeds fan (although one female Blackpool fan did once make a snarky comment to the face of a female Leeds fan, regarding how she was dressed). This even includes a rather extreme case when, following a 2-1 Carling Cup defeat to Leicester, the entire away support were allowed to march on the streets outside Elland Road to their car park, while singing ""We all hate Leeds scum!"" the entire time.

Elland Road is very much a family friendly place, nowadays. Some people would tell you that it's *too* friendly. Of course, there is still a lot of swearing, unsavoury chants are often heard and some merchandise vendors outside the ground sell 18+ material (I'm specifically thinking of a Leeds scarf with a naked lady on it), so it's not exactly a bastion of morality. But there are designated family areas and the club's membership scheme for away tickets has done a lot to root out troublemakers.

**TL;DR: fans of Leeds United have really cleaned up their image, although there is still a very small element of troublemakers, and some people would rather go back to the old days. In reality, I think that the sterile image of the modern game, combined with being humbled by a long spell away from the top tier, has really pacified fans.**",0,1365967432,null,0,1365968007,0,c9f3wda,t3_1cbj76,t1_c9f3wda,t3_1cbj76,null,1431559238,6,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,6

You can buy out their share(except in certain areas where they always retain at least a 10% stake in the property)When you sell the property the Scottish goverment gets a proportional share of the sale price.

I can categorically say that Thatcher created, at least in Liverpool, a virtual ghetto.  Many won't agree but when you take away industry, you take away hope, you take away chances for young people.   The social and economic problems faced by people in Liverpool can be traced back to the wholesale destruction that Thatcher inflicted on people, of course this wasn't just happening in Liverpool but Yorkshire, Hartlepool (British Steel) and many other places.   The Thatcherite government toyed with writing Liverpool off following the 1981 riots (which I remember as I was living in Toxteth at the time) See here:  http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/dec/30/thatcher-government-liverpool-riots-1981

I think it was a shameful time for people in a wider social scope than we think, greed was rewarded and people were pushed down the ladder of consideration in the race to get richer and richer.

History: I've done the American west, Jack the Ripper (coursework), surgery (sources exam) and medicine.

Know your names and dates off by heart, and try to get a good sense of things work chronologically. Quick thinking is also essential: coming up with strong point fast in an exam. 

German: so far I've found German to be an absolute breeze! I've finished all my coursework (speaking and writing assessments). If your school runs an exchange, and you can afford it, GO ON IT! It may seem scary but I've been on four and it's truly invaluable for pronunciation, confidence and learning some hilarious German slang! Cram in as many impressive grammar structures as you can, easy to adapt and will get you tons of marks! I've got two excellent teachers, so I'm pretty lucky, but I'm sure you'll be fine either way! Presumably you're doing German at the moment? 

For me, GCSE was radically different to year 9 in terms of workload. Don't let yourself fall behind, as it's very hard to make it up again! Put in 100% effort from day one and the rest will be fine.

No one in their right minds would *welcome* being told that the police, whose conduct the government was ultimately responsible for, had been involved in a cover up.  Instead she wanted the language to be changed to say the government ""welcomed the thoroughness of the report and its recommendations"".

*All that is is wordsmithing over the wording of a statement that was released at the same time as the report*.  It is not evidence of a cover up, since the report was published, and there is nothing in the article that implies they were trying to cover the report up.  That proves nothing (absence of evidence is not evidence of absence), but I'm not **saying** there wasn't a cover up, I'm saying I want to see something to back that assertion up.

The only other thing the note says is that the report was a ""devastating criticism"" of the police.  Well no shit Sherlock, it **was**.

So thanks for making assumptions out of nowhere on my behalf, and as you treat me patronisingly and as an idiot, I'll feel free not to read your long articles. Thanks.

Perhaps you could get away from the idea that I'm trying to attack ""lefties."" As I at no point attack people who are on the left - perhaps my comment ""be they from the right or left"" might have tipped you off on that. I still am not interested in reading a long discussion on the nature of divisive politics from someone who misreads my clearly undivisive comments.

&gt; The self-proclaimed left and the arts are as full of self-interested wankers as is the right.

You see?

I made a mistake and wrote the Arts Fund rather than the Arts Council. But didn't it occur to you, in reading the first line about it being a fund for buying art works on behalf of the nation, that I may have used the wrong term?

&gt; it sounds like your acquaintance's ""impeccable liberal credentials"" might be that she's a member of the labour party, in which case you've just told me she's a small-t tory instead of a capital-T one. The labour party haven't been ""properly"" left wing since 1995, and their ""social democratic"" credibility is rather weak, too.

I'm aware of the shift in the Labour Party, having lived in Britain for the past 30 years. I was pointing out that there is a perceived set of liberal credentials that are used by people to represent themselves publicly where there is funding for liberal projects. Not a revolutionary comment to make, one that is well-known, if only because Arts Council (there we are) funding requires certain set criteria to be met for them to provide funding, so that real need can be ignored if it is not presented correctly to them. You can take courses on it, its so well-known.

It's also a big reason why you can't tell who genuinely cares about left-wing issues, as it now pays to be a nice left-wing person.

I can certainly do all the writing that you say, but the point I was making was questioning the values of a body that does not even look at the advertising of the projects it pays for, never mind asks for a report that they would check, being more concerned with their public image, which is left-wing. That being my point - it is not just an ""ad hominem"" (God, you kids are impressed with using important-sounding terms) to point out that there is a professional left, but something that explains why a socially abusive situation - like interns - has no effective Public counter in the creative industry, which largely presents itself as liberal, certainly while New Labour were in power.

This has caused much cultural confusion, and it needs saying that the liberal arts really aren't so liberal.

&gt; the loudest voices for equality, that drown the rest of us out, are not interested in equality, be they from the right or left.

You see, not divisive - recognising that it is a problem of public life, not one political division.

true,worotan,null,null,"&gt; Margaret Thatcher voiced concern that a 1989 report into the Hillsborough disaster constituted a ""devastating criticism"" of police, previously-unpublished Cabinet papers revealed on Wednesday.

The comment came in a handwritten note by the then-prime minister in the margin of a civil servant's memo informing her that Home Secretary Douglas Hurd planned to welcome the broad thrust of Lord Taylor's interim report on its publication in August 1989.

The prime minister, now Baroness Thatcher, had already been warned that the interim report was ""very damning"" of police but attached ""little or no blame"" to Liverpool fans.

The interim report found that the chief superintendent in charge at Hillsborough had ""behaved in an indecisive fashion"" and senior officers infuriated the judge by seeking to ""duck all responsibility when giving evidence"" to his inquiry, she was told in a memo from a senior civil servant.

The memo made clear that Mr Hurd thought South Yorkshire Chief Constable Peter Wright would have to resign, adding: ""The enormity of the disaster, and the extent to which the inquiry blames the police, demand this.""

And it added: ""The defensive, and at times close to deceitful, behaviour by the senior officers in South Yorkshire sounds depressingly familiar.

""Too many senior policemen seem to lack the capacity or character to perceive and admit faults in their organisation.""

The interim report would ""sap confidence in the police force"" and could encourage aggressive behaviour by fans towards officers, said the memo, adding that: ""Liverpool fans - who have caused trouble in the past - will feel vindicated.""

But Mrs Thatcher made clear in her handwritten note that she did not want to give the Government's full backing to Lord Taylor's criticisms, only to the way in which he had conducted his inquiry and made recommendations for action.

She wrote: ""What do we mean by 'welcoming the broad thrust of the report'? The broad thrust is devastating criticism of the police. Is that for us to welcome? Surely we welcome the thoroughness of the report and its recommendations - M.T.""

There you go. Or do you think that Hurd would have read that and thought he could ignore her wishes? If so, you are ignoring one of the major points always made about Thatcher - her cabinet ministers said what she wanted them to. They did what they were told. And Hurd did what he was told, here. 

&gt; This would be the kind of evidence of a cover up we are interested in. Please link it.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"I think in the short term, say 20 years, it would not be a problem to use rUK's interest rates.

Although they would be a ""foreign country"", the country in question would be rUK - not Indonesia. As such they would continue to be deeply interlinked with Scotland's economy (and vice versa). The world is a different place now of course, but Ireland maintained a link to sterling for 50 years.

Think about the three main scenarios for interest rates in the UK: exceptionally low (0-2%, as at present), normal (4-7%), or very high (15+%). Very high interest rates are the only real concern, and it is unlikely that the UK will find itself going down that road voluntarily.

The primary problem with a Eurozone-wide interest rate is that the economies it spans vary wildly in their productivity - what's good for Germany is not necessarily good for Portugal. Scotland's and rUK's economies are unlikely to grow apart that quickly, if at all.

IMO the biggest danger with using Sterling is that Scotland could find itself a casualty of a run on the pound. A serious devaluation of Sterling would be difficult for Scotland, and at that point we might find ourselves needing to adopt the Euro (of course the same is true for rUK: current problems aside, the Euro's greatest strength is the overall size of the economies backing it - who's to say that it won't make sense for the UK too in 20 years?).",0,1365974045,null,0,false,0,c9f62nd,t3_1c9itl,t1_c9f62nd,t1_c9f3jij,null,1431558142,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

But set against that the Twentieth Century had some other stories to tell about mass-murder and genocide didn't it?

* Armenian Genocide perpetrated by nationalists.
* Bosnian Genocide perpetrated by nationalists.
* Augusto Pinochet's mass murder of dissidents.
* The Dirty War in Chile.
* The Shah of Iran's rule of terror.
* Francisco Franco's execution of dissidents.
* Rafael Trujillo's brutal rule.
* Papa Doc Duvalier's bizarre and cruel rule.
* Baby Doc Duvalier's continuation of same.
* Efraín Ríos Montt's... you know I'm running out of synonyms for brutal and corrupt regimes right now.
* Suharto's slaughters in East Timor and elsewhere.
* Mobutu Sese Seko's rule in Zaire
* Idi Amin's rule in Uganda
* Mullah Omar's Taliban... oh you thought Theocracy was left-wing? It's about as purely conservative as it gets.

This is nowhere near an exhaustive list and I have left off some of the big name hitters.

I will throw one more name into this post however because some would tell you that it is the one name which comes closest to summing up the terrible lessons of the Twentieth Century and surely tha one person most responsible for its primary trauma:

Mark Gatiss has this annoying obsession with making his episodes some kind of history lesson. Plus his humor is really cringe-worthy.

* The resolution made no sense and the HADS thing was a total ass-pull. I dont care if its a classic Who thing, I know a deus ex machina when I see one.
* The claw scenes were utterly laughable and destroyed what suspense had been built up to that point. Were we supposed to take it that he would crush their heads or something. It gave the actors nothing to work with.
* The characters were totally one dimensional; the captain with the solemn responsibility, the ambitious first officer who'll betray them, the quirky professor type  (""What about Duran Duran?! HAHAHA Im such a light-hearted character"").
* They dug him out of the ice, some moron unfreezes him, and THEN he turns out to be the alien leader. Talk about serendipitous.
* The Doctor and Clara just appear out of nowhere, heading for somewhere else again (this trick is getting REALLY tired now.), and they pull the same old trick of the Tardis disappearing. If Gatiss can't be bothered to write stories around the Tardis then he shouldn't be involved with this show.

true,worotan,null,null,"&gt; (note that they were telling her this before she had the results of the report)

You don't see that it was her responsibility to trust the Independent Report over what she had previously chatted about informally?

It doesn't matter that she was told that before the report was published(yes, I realised that she was told that before the report was published, duh). She had two pieces of information, and she prioritised the informal, partial, hidden information over the formally-acquired, impartial public evidence.

You know, if you believe she was so weak-minded as to just implicitly believe whoever told her a version of events first, and to believe that over an extensive independent public report, you really are not capable of interpreting events as anything other than a child's level.

She gave a clear message to the nation that she was on the side of the Police over the fans in what Taylors report said. The Police in charge were never disciplined, in fact were promoted. Her response to the report was to do what helped the Police hold up their story for over 20 years.

&gt; the government's official statement should not say something clearly ridiculous that the government was ""welcoming the broad thrust of the report"". No one in their right minds would welcome being told that the police, whose conduct the government was ultimately responsible for, had been involved in a cover up. Instead she wanted the language to be changed to say the government ""welcomed the thoroughness of the report and its recommendations"".

You can be unhappy that there has been corruption and mistakes, that need acting upon, surely? I'm not saying she would have been happy at being told about this, for Christs sake, just that she chose not to act on it, in fact to block the recommended actions of the Taylor Report.

Do you think an acceptable response to being told that senior Police figures have shifted the blame onto the victims to protect themselves, is to say that you're happy that the report was very thorough, but to make sure that detail is not mentioned by those responsible for acting on the report? Of course not, she was trying to play down the criticism of the Police. Why on Earth do you think that's an acceptable, rather than a self-interested response?

To clarify - of course she was not happy about being told ""devastating criticism"" of Police. That doesn't mean that not saying anything about this was an acceptable response. I'm amazed you suggest that it is!

You say there was no cover-up. No official action was taken to investigate those who had been shown to have caused the disaster, so that it was more than 20 years later before the full details came out, showing that Police officers had been coerced into changing their written reports. Fundamental corruption of the grass-roots level was allowed to pass officially for as long as the careers of those involved lasted. Their faults were covered up, officially. They were never investigated.

You're not going to find a piece of paper saying ""naughty me, I have prevented the full investigation of known corrupt senior Police Officers, signed Margaret Thatcher"" but you can consider that no-one was officially punished for Hillsborough. Their crimes were covered up. They were allowed to prosper in British society, rewarded and promoted, while those who were the victims were emotionally punished. How is that not a cover-up?

Officially, the Taylor Report became an opinion, some of which was acted upon as true - all seater stadia etc. - and some of which was treated officially as wrong - that the Police had caused the problem and then tried to cover that up. Their cover-up was allowed to continue for over 20 years, despite the government being urged to investigate it.

What part of cover-up don't you understand? You can read lots of reports like Taylors. If they aren't officially acted on, then they are meaningless. Thatchers note shows how she went about making sure that the report was not fully acted on, through misdirection of attention, as is necessary to corruption.

You don't seem to understand the actual point of covering something up. You prevent its investigation so that the guilty can continue in public life. That the Taylor report is available means nothing if the further investigation he recommended was prevented from taking place. It was only last year that the investigation did take place, and revealed the extent of the corruption of the Police this incident caused.

It isn't a ""pop-chart"" (btw are you 90? Who calls it that?)  it's a snap shot of what is popular this week. It's a snapshot of the public and in its trivial and silly way, it's an important historical document.

The game against Man City was the best I have ever seen him play, he terrorised their defence and was about the pitch like a man possessed (in a good way), and if he showed that effort and willingness everytime he stepped onto the pitch I would be overjoyed.

Part of me puts the blame of his lack of trying on his mentors, namely Yakubu and Saha, neither of whom were the most energetic on the pitch but when in form both could be lethal infront of goal.

Maybe it is a confidence thing with him, maybe in the back of his mind he is worried about picking up another major injury which has so far blighted his career, but hopefully he can put that chapter behind him and push on to be the player he has shown the potential to be ever since his early exploits in Europe.",0,1365978555,null,0,false,0,c9f7l9f,t3_1cbwwk,t1_c9f7l9f,t3_1cbwwk,null,1431557427,2,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,2

My secondary school had been wanting a rebuild for years (although AFAIK it wasn't falling apart like some other schools), it did finally get one just after the coalition came in to power (don't know who approved it).

And no it's not moving the goal post. It's called research. Even as if you consider the bible as literature, which a lot of biblical scholars and  history of religion folk do, you need to understand the root and method of transmission and the context they were written - plus the interpretations attached. 

To achieve a PhD in anything, and therefore an expertise, you need a literature review. You need to present the state of the art and understand what the different theoretical or philosophical approaches are before you situate your own conclusion. 

If Dawkins and Harris et al want to claim understanding, why can't they apply what their colleagues at Oxbridge and/or the Ivy League history of religion scholars do, they can even spicy it up with a bit of Anthropology. A lot of history or religion folk and anthropologists are actually athiests but they operate very differently. 

The problem for those two is that if they enter those fields, then their logical positivism begins to fray at the edges and creek. They would have to consider the different epistemologies and ontologies used by those scholars and be able to apply them. It's just too much hard work for them.

That allowed the corrupt Police to continue their careers. Even if she was not sure, she could have investigated them and found out. She did not want them investigated. She covered-up their corruption, till more than 20 years later a new commission - that the government significantly and clearly accepted in full - revealed the extent of the Police cover up.

I don't think you're a Thatcher shill, I just don't understand how you don't see that there was a cover up when the Police's actions were never investigated, despite the report specifically urging that investigation.

&gt; the entirely tangential government statement about the report. I don't give a shit about the government statement about the report, I'm after something to substantiate Salvaxe's assertion. What in that has anything to do with trying to cover it up? How is ""We welcome the thoroughness of the report and its recommendations"" some kind of cover up but ""we welcome the broad thrust of the report"" not? What exactly does that change in wording conceal?

That Government statement on the report was not tangental, it was the person who commissioned the report giving the official response as to what was to be taken seriously and acted upon in it. It wasn't just someone's opinion being texted in to a news programme.

The two sentences you quote are not relevant to my argument, the prevention of criticism of the Police is - so the problem I'm pointing out to you is that she - not I - associates ""we welcome the broad thrust of the report"" with conveying a ""devastating criticism of the police."" Which her government would not do, so that the criticisms were never investigated.The problems that were identified as requiring investigation were covered up and not investigated.

That's the point, the note shows that she - not I - considered the wording to be important in enabling her government not to criticise the Police. Or investigate them. To prevent that investigation from taking place, as it was not felt necessary by the person in charge. To cover up the problem so people wouldn't see them, and the suspects could continue in well-paid public office, deciding public policy, while the victims were officially said to have been what the Police said. Rather than the truth. Which was covered up, officially.

Do you need a piece of paper written by Thatcher saying ""I want there to be a cover-up'?!!! Her government prevented the investigation of Police whose actions killed 96 members of the public, and joined in their attempts to destroy the public reputations of the victims, which was always clearly a plan to shift the the blame and misdirect attention.

First off, remember it's a nation of immigrants - people who left Europe (and specifically the UK) to escape awful living conditions and forge a new life. This is the American Dream - the idea that you can just set out and create a life for yourself, and with hard work and ingenuity you'll be successful. 

This of course is very individualistic in nature, and the flip side of that of course is a strong feeling that everything you've accomplished *you did by yourself*. Then the government comes along and demands taxes off you, taxes out of your *hard earned money that you made by yourself*. And what do they want to do with that money? Spend it on welfare! Give it to people who didn't work hard and make a success of themselves! 

You see welfare (and to a less extent, taxes) are the antithesis of the American Dream, the founding ideal, something deeply embedded in the cultural mythos of the nation. 

But welfare also means ""Big Government"", and if there's one thing the Americans hate, it's the idea of Big Government. There are, as I'm sure you are aware, historical precedents to this! Liberty is a founding principle of the USA, and liberty is about personal freedom. Government, by it's very nature, restricts freedoms. So not only is Big Government representative of the colonial past, but it's against another founding principle of America. 

You're right of course that there is a certain rabid anti-communist streak in American culture, and calling somebody a socialist is basically an insult, but that rabid hatred of Communism comes from the fact that it represents the absolute opposite of everything America was founded on. ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his need"" is about as far away from the American Dream as it's possible to get.

I think I'm rambling now, but basically Welfare and Social Responsibility = Un-American because it's against the ""American Dream"".

Mrs Thatcher was in charge of the Home Secretary. The Home Secretary is is charge of the Police. She was told that there were lies that needed investigating in the Police, and refused to let the Home Secretary do anything about it. She prevented the Police from being investigated when she was told that they were lying.

By stopping the investigation, she allowed them to cover up their crimes. She personally did that, as the note shows. She wrote that she did not want the Police to be criticised, and they weren't. This was, as the report accepted in full by David Cameron 6 fucking months ago, the tactic of the Police to distract attention away from their culpability. The note is her telling the person in charge that her government is going to take the Police line. She didn't personally hide any boxes. But she told everyone to follow the line of those who were hiding the boxes, so that their story matched that of Her Majesties Government, which officially, is the truth.

Grab yourself a pork loin, order some curing salt off amazon and slap the right amounts of everything in a big ziplock bag and rub it all in. Turn it over in the fridge every day or two and after a week or so you have yourself some delicious back bacon. I even bought a cheap deli slicer to cut it up properly.

[Here's the cure mix calculator I used.](http://www.localfoodheroes.co.uk/?e=541) I lowered the sugar, though, since the first time I found it too sweet. I tried the drying part the first few times, and while I'm sure that results in an objectively better product, I was trying to replicate that bacon you get in the supermarket where it leaks a ton of water into the pan when you slap it down, so now I don't bother drying it. :P

THEN I went to a British shop and bought some HP sauce and learned to bake the perfect corn syrup-free sandwich loaf ([this recipe](http://blessusolord.blogspot.com/2011/06/yummy-soft-white-bread.html) baked in a [half-size pullman pan](http://browncookie.com/products/small-pain-de-mie-pullman-bread-pan-with-lid) makes enough for two loaves, or one loaf in a full-size pullman pan if you eat lots and lots of bread).

All of this stuff takes time and a little practice and dedication, but it's NOWHERE near as difficult as I ever thought it would be and the results are worth it. Far cheaper than buying even the local sub-standard fare in the shops, and it's fun to watch people's jaws drop when you tell them you made the bread and bacon yourself.

So I guess the problem with personal responsibility is, in a way,  that it isn't responsible, and it isn't at times ethical to advocate.

true,Radwancfc,null,null,"I know we talk about an overhaul every summer, but we need several changes to turn this side into a title-challenging one. We've got brilliant individuals in the likes of Eden, Mata, Luiz et al. but the team is not balanced. I'd say we need a center-back, two midfielders, a quick winger and a world class striker.

For center-back, I'd have Dede from Vasco de Gama, pacey foil for David Luiz and is a monster of a defender. Has had Neymar in his pocket when they've faced each other in the league. Doubt we'll sign a defender though, so I'd recall Kalas and/or Omeruo and integrate him/them into the squad.

For center midfield, we need a passer and a destroyer. I'm a big fan of Ramires and Mikel, but squad depth is crucial for a club like us, and Mikel is very very inconsistent. Several players I'd take here. Joao Moutinho is my favorite, incredible player. If not him then maybe Yohan Cabaye. Then there's Paulinho of Corinthians who's also brilliant who I'd sign as the 'destroyer'. There's also Kevin Strootman who's a lovely little player who can do pretty much everything a midfielder should do. Alternatives would be Marco Verratti (doubt we'd be able to get him though) or Victor Wanyama. Just stay away from Marouane Fellaini, very very overrated for my liking, and too expensive.

Hulk would be my pick for winger, still believe the lad would cut it in the prem, and he's basically built for this league. Reckon he'd destroy opposition fullbacks. Seems Andre Schurlle is a confirmed deal too.

Upfront, don't know who I'd have tbh, I'd definitely bring back Lukaku and give him minutes. I'd also like a forward who can link play with the trio behind him, not just a goalscorer, someone like Suarez. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is an excellent alternative though, and a very very good player, whom we could get. Maybe even Wilfred Bony who's scored shitloads for Vitesse. Would love if we signed Robert Lewandowski though - who would be my pick.

In: Dede, Moutinho, Paulinho, Hulk, Lewandowski. Would cost around 100 million, but that's just my two pence.",0,1365984757,null,0,false,0,c9f9jvx,t3_1cc5d3,t1_c9f9jvx,t3_1cc5d3,null,1431556503,10,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,10

Typically, unions are able to negotiate and bargain for better wages, better working conditions, better benefits,...all aspects that make the job livable. In a place with little union density, say hotels in Texas, it is a slow process to accrue a standard of living through unions.  But it does happen with organization.  This is done through density, or increases in membership within an area.  So while housekeepers at the single union hotel in Austin might make $9.50/hr; in New York City, where union density is something like 90%, they have fought for upwards of $20-something/hr.  

The trick is reminding management and the owners of a corporation that Labor is a central component of their business.  Labor should have a right to fight for a portion that relates increases in productivity, competitive wages within the field, as well as wages that take into account the macroeconomic factors like standard of living and inflation.  If Labor is not organized though (which is done through a union) they have no way of bargaining for this right.  They end up being exploited.  

The financial benefit is not direct.  The direct benefit is representation and organization.

We face few shots because we can prevent our opponents' opportunities for ""'ave a dig, son"" shots.

On the flip side, the shots we do concede tend to be much better than average because of this reliance upon soaking up threats before they become serious. When we fail to do this our opponents often have an easy time of scoring. This obviously causes the higher proportion of shots being goals. What we need to work on is preventing the kind of counter-attacks that lead to clear-cut chances. This should get better as the defenders get more used to playing with each other.

He met her first in his tenth incarnation, but it was Eleven who fell in love with her and was married to her.  
  
With that in mind, it's my view that the resolution of her story is intrinsically tied up with that of the eleventh Doctor.  
  
She might reappear later on for later Doctors yet, but her marriage with the Doctor will end with this incarnation.  I think she will insist on this, so that he doesn't feel the obligation to be tied to her for the rest of his life.

Indeed, I'm not 100% sure what the situation is currently, but when I left the UK a decade ago, so long as you were wealthy enough to consult a private doctor at a private clinic and obtain a private prescription, heroin was still effectively perfectly legal.  What has happened is that it's become increasingly impossible for anyone unable to go this route to secure legal heroin, the number of doctors licensed to prescribe heroin for the treatment of addiction on the NHS has been increasingly controlled and radically diminished, and most doctors who are qualified to do so [are fearful of or outright opposed to such prescribing](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1759719.stm).  This has been changing, as have attitudes to dependant drug users, but there's still and awful lot of poor understanding about the nature of addiction and prejudice against dependant drug users.  To be fair to GPs and general hospital doctors (I'm less charitable towards psychiatrists and specialists), negative experience of interacting with and treating drug users, as well as their lack of confidence in managing addictive behaviour, may make this understandable.

From what I understand he'd play either as a number 10 or on the left wing, and in either case he's got Mata and Hazard ahead of him. Seems like he plays in the exact same roles as those two, probably causing him to be a like-for-like sub which is rarely useful.

Its maximum depth is also 400m, which I didn't know before looking it up. [I suppose that gets to the heart of it (what one may reasonably expect the audience to know) but rough estimates of nuclear sub capabilities isn't exactly obscure or useless knowledge]

It's also definitely the class of sub seen in the show, in fact it's probably a Delta III given the episode is set in 1983. So the stated figures are even more advanced than the capabilities of the ship shown. And what I have to ask is ""why?"" You're underwater, in a sub, in the arctic; you're just as boned at 50m as you are at 700m!

true,EltonJohnsBallbag,flair7,,"**PROS**

♥ 15 goals in 30 games for a relegation-threatened side devoid of any real creative force. With only the (admittedly promising) Andy Weimann ever playing alongside him for support

♥ Can create goals out of nothing. See, for example, any of his strikes against Liverpool this season.

♥ Excellent hold-up play. The man is a fucking tank, and has that magnet-like quality to his frame, where 50/50's seem to gravitate towards him. Reminiscent of an in-form Heskey (don't laugh) or even Drogba (IN THIS ONE CATEGORY. RELAX). The same goes for attacking headers and aerial presence going forwards.

♥ Is young. Now I hate how some people completely overstate the importance of youth here, but it does have its merits. He has time to grow on an intellectual level, and he is not too stuck in his ways to adapt to a new system/team/environment. Will hopefully still have the desire and drive that youth brings.

♥ Will, most likely, be relatively cheap. The fact is, he's not a huge name playing for a glamourous team in an exotic league (e.g. Falcao, Damião) so will naturally not have as overinflated a price (fingers crossed).

♥ Would fit Spurs' system nicely. Whilst Villa are in the shit, they do play some nice attacking football (it's not Benteke's fault they can't defend). He's perfect for long-ball hold-up play, tiki-taka involvement with the more creative midfielders, and can be a presence when tracking back due to his size and relative speed. He doesn't need another striker alongside him and if he's getting this many goals with Weimann as trequartista then imagine what Bale would do to his game.

卐 Is relatively unproven. Yes, it's true, one great season in the PL does not a world-beater make. It has big potential to backfire.

卐 He could cost us. I know I argued the other way on this point before, but it's true. On this here other hand, we could be held to ransom as young players who do well in the PL can be costly (see Andy Carroll, Jordan Henderson, Stewart Downing. Hah, Liverpool).

卐 I...I'm all out on this one. Sorry. I've attempted an objective view for us all here, but due to the great season he's had and the stark contrast he provides to his shitbag teammates I just don't think I can say anything else against him. I was skeptical before, but he's won me over with his sheer consistency. I would like this signing to happen.

EDIT: 卐 Poor pass completion rate, as veridical kindly pointed out. Whether this is down to the quality of the balls played to him/the movement and ability of teammates around him remains to be seen. Certainly an interesting concern though. ",0,1366018492,null,0,1366035202,0,c9fi81j,t3_1cde5o,t1_c9fi81j,t1_c9fh0hz,null,1431552343,20,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,20

If she had had a solemn funeral, family-lead and in line with that given to other prime ministers over the last 60 years, I think that would have commanded the respect of most people and could have been a moment of reflection.

However the unusual step of giving her a full ceremonial funeral sends a clear message that ""this is a woman who commands a special place in the heart of the nation"".

In the case of this particular episode, the Doctor at least demonstrated some basic capability and knowledge that made it logical for the sub captain to defer him to as at least an expert on the subject. But the entire dynamic was so poorly handled: The captain takes orders from him; then he distrusts him completely; then he takes orders from him; then he distrusts him completely; then he takes orders from him... And there's never any instigation or motivation for the shifts.

A key example of this is in the sequence surrounding the interrogation: You can't talk to the alien because I don't trust you. But I guess I'll trust the girl you came in with, despite the fact that I have just as much cause to distrust her as you. And then... you know what? Screw it. You'll be in complete charge of the conversation and I'll say absolutely nothing despite the fact that 30 seconds ago I didn't trust you enough to have the conversation I'm now allowing you to have.
