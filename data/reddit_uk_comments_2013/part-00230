Sometimes it's like he is the only one in team capable of supplying those sublime incisive passes and creating and exploiting space. We look better with him in the team but the game also becomes a little lopsided. Navas, I'm not sure, is the ideal solution as lacks the ability to combine well with aguero, silva and co. Maybe someone like Mata would be better suited to our needs? Isco would've been perfect but he preferred madrid and that door is closed.

If we have say, Ashley Cole and Hazard attacking one full back, even if Gerrard/Henderson comes over to cover, it again will exploit our centre midfield.

I don't think your statement holds true at any point in his life, beginning, middle or end.

Orwell wrote a lot and one of the familiar themes (of many) in his writing is anti-authoritarianism. 

He saw political and social authoritarianism manifest in communist, fascist and indeed western democratic capitalist societies.

To infer from this that he had a particular distaste for 'leftists' is a little wide of the mark. Though I have no idea what you mean by 'leftist'. Do you mean all politics left of centre, or are you referencing particular communist dictatorships? Or, do you see it as all the same thing?

My guess is that the phone won't suddenly stop working if it can't contact the server, only that it locks after being told to.

It's hard to say for sure. Moses had a good season for Chelsea, but was still shipped out by Mourinho. And Mourinho's certainly a manager who has a 'type', and rarely accommodates players that don't fit his type - see how Mata's been relegated to the 2nd XI until he shows he can do what Mourinho wants from his wide players, or convince Mourinho he's a better no. 10 than Oscar. So it'll take more than Moses doing well - he'd have to do well and tick a bunch of Mourinho's boxes, and I doubt whether that will happen.

&gt; B) I know, but 5m for Ince is tough to pass up on

Who are we, Redknapp FC? I'd rather save that 5m and put it towards a single larger money first-XI signing; as I replied to someone below, there's two ways we build our squad from here, one being by signing for depth (Ince and the like), the other being signing new first XI players that push others into depth positions.

Most get their degree, and stop. Just stop, dead where they are and start applying for jobs.

They then whine when they are turned down.

Development specifically is not all about degrees. It helps, but it is not the only requirement and should not be the *only* thing you have to prove you can do the job you are applying to do.

People seem to be sold the idea, maybe when they are in uni, that once they qualify they will walk right into a job.

People need to take responsibility for advancing their career, and with development in particular, it's constantly changing. If you don't keep up, you won't have that job for very long. I also noticed many jobs now take jQuery as one of their requirements, and *many* of the degrees barely touch Javascript let alone any of the frameworks built on top.

I interviewed a CS graduate from Bristol Uni. Their CV said ""Very proficient in .NET"". I gave them a few questions. I asked them how would I use LINQ to filter a collection.

""What's LINQ?"" was the answer.

/facepalm.

Their CV also said ""Highly skilled in SQL (all flavours)"". So I asked them to write a query that included a temporary table and a nested query. They knew how to do neither of these.

That said... there was something that stood out in the stats to me:

&gt; Delph is a strong tackler, he has committed the second most tackles in Villa (3.7 per game) and he also has a low foul rate (1.3 per game

and then...

&gt; one of the biggest issues with Delph may possibly be his discipline, as he has accumulated the highest amount of yellow cards (4) at Villa.

... that doesn't really compute. Unless his bookings are for dissent (which I don't recall them being)

I feel like this criticism of Delph's discipline should probably be toned down a bit. Yeah he gets frustrated sometimes, but he's still young and relatively inexperienced. Yes, he should probably stay on his feet more often when tackling, but he's not playing an overtly reckless game.

Based on those numbers, you could easily argue that he's being booked disproportionately often, I think. Perhaps because people think of him as a sort of ""hatchet man"".

In the place I work, Radio 1 reigns supreme, hence my disdain for the media in general. Nobody needs Fern Cotton's voice at 10am, or at any point in the day for the rest of humanity's existence. Nobody.

But as for the four people killed in the storm, three of those people died in their houses, one via a falling tree and the other, also by a falling tree that caused a gas explosion. Staying in your home seems to be the issue, maybe if the media had been a little more realistic in suggesting that perhaps trees might fall over, rather than focusing on the record-breaking apocalyptic nature of the storm then nobody would have died. 

But hey, I'm not god, nor would I want to be so all I can do is speculate and confabulate. I'm not saying I want a storm that would shit all over the country, I live in Reading, which was allegedly meant to be right down the rifle sights of St. Jude and I'm fond of being alive. What I am against is sloppy journalism, Radio 1 is just an example as it was what was being pumped into my head at the time of writing. The warnings and fear that they attached to the storm made it something of a non-event that distracts people from real issues that can be controlled by humans. Issues such as the car bombs that went off across Iraq that day, the ongoing trials of the News of the World ""journalists"", the NSA bugging Angela Merkel's phone, the list goes on there are worthy news stories that are scary that receive far less coverage than they deserve for the impact they will have on people's lives and our society as a whole, yet instead we fritter away our time staring out the window going ""ooooh looks wet out there"". 

So I apologise for coming across as a smug dick as you so eloquently put it, have you thought about writing, I think you'd be good at it, that whole alphabet thing seems to come quite naturally to you. But it might not be simulating enough for you. But you sir, missed the point. By a long way.

I find this argument that ""It's because people want free food"" to be laughable. And actually pretty insulting to the people who use the food banks. I think you'd find that most people who are referred to them are actually fucking mortified about it - embarrassed and ashamed that they can't support their families.

There is no attempt to dictate what EU Member states must do with regards to maximum water usage in toilets in each state. The EU is not dictating a maximum amount per flush, above which it will be illegal to install a new toilet.

Indeed, as the text in this article points out, many EU countries already have laws about flushing. This includes the UK, which [since 2001](http://www.bathroom-association.org/press.asp?ID=179) has had a regulation dictating a maximum of 6 litres per flush for any new toilet installed.

Secondly, this study only relates to the ""Ecolabel"" system of consumer information. Ecolabels are EU-wide agreed definitions for when certain products can be deemed environmentally friendly. They have no legal weight, and are merely designed to inform consumers. Any producer whose products meet the thresholds can use the ""Ecolabel"" logo and terms in their packaging and advertising.

This study is merely trying to add toilets to the list of products which can have an ecolabel applied. It attempts to come up with a definition of what would be considered environmentally friendly in the world of flushing toilets.

It's this kind of scaremongering headline which gives the EU a bad name.

Blackadder seems to do well abroad as it has Dr House and Mr Bean behaving like children. First season isn't very good but last three are great.

Top Boy is pretty good gritty drama. Blue Planet is a good documentary series about oceans, ditto Animal Planet.

Royale Family and The Office are popular but personally I think they are junk. The IT Crowd and Shameless are very good, particularly Shameless.

Strike Back is good action bit like 24 but with swearing and sex. Ultimate Force is similar but tamer.

Silk is excellent legal drama.

Robson Green's Extreme Fishing is a funny, expletive filled fishing show.

The Thick of It is fucking brilliant political comedy. Absolute Power is similar but about the PR industry.

Spooks is a good very spy drama.

Fresh Meat and the Inbetweeners are brilliant portrayals of British university and secondary school respectively.

&gt; In that it wasn't mentioned anywhere except by tinfoil hatters. There's no reason why such a list needs to exist, and no evidence that it would exist.
&gt;Even if it did, what potential would it have? I fail to see why turning the filter off is some sort of blackmail opportunity.

If the list didn't exist, how would the ISPs know how had opted out. There isn't a centralised list, but of course all ISPs know who has and hasn't, and their lists are therefore subject to both leaking and court orders.

We've already people from social services on Radio 4 suggesting that the opt in list be used in custody cases.

&gt; We have had opt-out filters on the mobile networks for years. I have not yet seen a news story or evidence of this filter being disabled being used against someone.

O2's list was used for credit card fraud as they forgot to encrypt their transmissions using https for the first 48 hours.

&gt; Do you have evidence of that? If it was really happening that would be quite a big news story. I am willing to bet that they aren't.

Because filtering systems hide government ordered censorship within all the incompetent misfiltering.

When have you ever heard an opponent say, ""Your calm presentation and well reasoned argument have persuaded me."" So to say that his passion or ""sharp wit"" are ineffective is an unnecessary statement. He did not use wit.

&gt;Wit: an ability to say or write things that are clever and usually funny

Responding yes or no to such a question would have little effect as well. His words were not taken out of context and he did not misspeak. Galloway decided not to debate someone who, he felt, supported something he was vehemently against. He used a personal anecdote to support why he felt that way. ""Race"" was not a factor here, so the question was unrelated. That is why he did not address it. He did not care about that. Galloway was stating his dismissal of apartheid.

A service you often don't pay for, designed to be used in public. Do excuse me if possibly the ability to look at porn in Starbucks is perhaps a little too much.

&gt; If the list didn't exist, how would the ISPs know how had opted out. There isn't a centralised list, but of course all ISPs know who has and hasn't, and their lists are therefore subject to both leaking and court orders.

There is no real list at all - at best an additional record in a database that is used when the user's router connects and is used to set up a session in the authentication server, I would imagine. That's not to say a list couldn't be generated given some effort, but there isn't inherently a list.

If such a list were leaked (this hasn't happened with the mobile networks...), again, why would it be a scandal? This isn't a ""do you want to look at child porn"" opt-out filter where it would be newsworthy if a politician or celebrity had turned it off, it's a ""do you want to gamble/look at forums/do many other legitimate and normal activities, and also look at legitimate, legal porn"" filter.

This mythical list is the construct of scaremongers and people whose tinfoil hats really are too tight.

&gt; O2's list was used for credit card fraud as they forgot to encrypt their transmissions using https for the first 48 hours.

Source? Is this due to someone turning the filter off? No details, all speculation.

&gt; https://twitter.com/davelee/status/395284121163137024[1]

Please excuse me if I don't quite believe a single Twitter user. Not even a screenshot showing what happens when you visit. I'm on T-Mobile and I would try but I think the filter is already disabled for me, despite never asking for it (oh noes, I'll be on that list! Now I can't be a politician)

Given how popular the Guardian is and how popular T-Mobile/Orange/EE is, I suspect there is far more to the story for the only piece of evidence is hearsay from Twitter.

&gt; Because filtering systems hide government ordered censorship within all the incompetent misfiltering.

No evidence of said censorship occuring - we already know full well when a court order blocks a website and it would be relatively easy for it to come out if they were ordering sites to be censored. There are many principled ISPs who would happily publicise and fight against it. Even BT/TalkTalk tried to get the Digital Economy Act thrown out.

Besides, it'd be pretty obvious that a site not working with the filter obviously turned off yet working on other internet connections would be a sign that something is amiss.",0,1383232580,null,0,1383233111,0,cd3qhss,t3_1plq65,t1_cd3qhss,t1_cd3q2ke,null,1428912335,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

However not all recruiters are well versed in the industry they are recruiting in.  So for you or I we can clearly see and say that X is equivalent to Y or that X is not important compared to Y, someone with less knowledge of the industry can't. 

I've had recruiters dismiss my experience of RedHat because the client wanted SuSE; both are RPM based distro's, both follow the Linux Standard Base layout and both have the usual tools, utilities and scripts in the usual places.   So from an admin POV they are essentially the same damn thing (support contract licensing is obviously different).

Years ago I've had recruiters who outright called me a liar and hung up... in the first instance it's because I said Windows 97 (I checked, it wasn't a typo) didn't exist and in the second they wanted 5 years experience of Windows 2000... in 2003.  Yes, he wanted to find someone with 5 years experience of a 3 year old OS and wasn't accepting NT4 as a gap filler. 

For example my CV lists Apache, IIS, a few DB's and such.  But nowhere does it explicitly state LAMP even though it's Linux.Apache.MySql (MariaDB).PHP.

Which is, I feel one of the main reasons we have 'skills shortages' in IT: recruiters don't know the industry (or don't care if they do) and can't find someone with the exact blend and experience required, even though there are perfectly good people with those skills listed looking for work.",0,1383234138,null,0,false,0,cd3r4az,t3_1plz6f,t1_cd3r4az,t1_cd3nylc,null,1428912043,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I totally agree that we shouldn't necessarily play the same formation against everyone (and realistically coming away from the Emirates with a point would probably be a good result right now), but conceding goals isn't necessarily an issue so long as you're scoring, which we are. Winning games 5-3 rather than 1-0 would be an acceptable consequence of playing with such an attacking formation. 

Personally I think it'll be an interesting game if both teams come out fairly attacking-minded.

The 3-1-4-2, used against West Brom with Lucas deep behind Henderson &amp; Gerrard, looked far better than anything with the 3-4-1-2 - and quite frankly, better than the 4-2-3-1 looked at any point this season. So personally I think we should set up the same way against Arsenal.

Also, all of Arsenal's proper wingers are injured right now, which means they're not going to hurt us with a back 3 as much as they might've.

Lucas is a stalwart, but Gerrard, Henderson and Allen should all be rotated in order to minimise injuries and encourage the development of the younger two.  With Gerrard its tricky as he's such a figure, but I feel when its right Rodgers should be ruthless and haul him off if he's flagging and also allow starts for the Henderson and Allen maybe against weaker opponents.

Coutinho is a mainstay as he is young and the future of the club, but if the time calls for it he should make the odd substitute appearance to give a start to Sterling or Ibe. I wouldn't start him this weekend , but when fully match fit I couldn't leave him out.  Every so often he has had a quiet game and if thats the case, once again Rodgers should be ruthless and replace him.

Oh, you mean a diamond 4-4-2. Mate, you gotta specify; you realise just writing 4-4-2 means 2 CM's and 2 wide men, yeah?

Anyway, I disagree about the diamond:

- Why switch systems for the biggest game of the season and play something we've never played before? 

- Coutinho's just come back from injury, so he might not be 100% sharp anyway; does he deserve to automatically start?

- The fullbacks in the 4-4-2 can't get as high up the pitch as they can in the 3-1-4-2, so our attack will lack width - and given that Arsenal will be pushing their fullbacks up, you want to be able to attack or counterattack them with width",0,1383236930,null,0,false,0,cd3sa65,t3_1pm4ln,t1_cd3sa65,t1_cd3s53d,null,1428911429,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"&gt; When someone approaches a topic with no passion, then why would listen to something that they seemingly do not care about?

Ah this is my misunderstanding, because I misread the source of the video. The video is taken from an address, or speech, not a debate, and I was talking about his style in the context of a debate, which is unfair. Speakers, distinct from debaters, need to be interesting and passionate to engage their audience, and in this respect, Galloway is perfect for it. I haven't seen him in debate, so maybe he's completely different in that context.

&gt; When have you ever heard an opponent say, ""Your calm presentation and well reasoned argument have persuaded me.""

In politics maybe not, because none of them use cool logic and reasoned arguments (and perhaps that is why it is always such a shambles?), but in the world of science and industry, people's minds are changed *all the time* by a calmly, well presented argument, presented in slide form, accompanied by supporting figures and evidence.

&gt; His words were not taken out of context and he did not misspeak. Galloway decided not to debate someone who, he felt, supported something he was vehemently against.

I had never heard of Galloway before this video and I didn't know what quote the student was referring to. So from the question, it sounded like Galloway had at some point in the past actually refused to debate someone purely because they were Israeli. If that were true, it would be pretty racist in my eyes.

However, apparently the real facts are that he refused to debate someone who was directly opposed to him and also happened to be Israeli, which meant that the debate was unlikely to go anywhere because the opponent had too much of a vested interest in it. Is that right? If so, then it puts him in a very different light. But how are people to know what the true circumstances were if he won't set the record straight?

I agree a very good tell, although I've taken some by surprise when I did answer I'd be more than happy too.

&gt;In those circumstances it's not a case of me not knowing my stuff - it's a case of there not being people out there who are looking at the level at which I'm recruiting.

He has shown a propensity to stick with a pretty consistent XI so far but I don't think that'll be sustainable over the full season. 

What can be done is just rotate in and out a few players at a time, making sure you don't have too much change at once. Generally play kids or depth players in weaker games and/or at home. Also take into account your opponents strengths and weaknesses while doing this, for example say we are playing Norwich and you know they aren't great at winning possession in the opponent's half or scoring goals, maybe you would drop Lucas for Allen, or you decide to play aspas with Suarez to give Sturridge rest if we're playing a team who has shown to be weak at stopping chances being created around the box but are good in the air.

As a fairly lengthy personal anecdote, my parents house was built around 120 years ago (Portsmouth) and has pretty bad insulation, my current flat (Southampton) is in a refurbished but essentially rebuilt house with good insulation, my wife is Danish and I've stayed at both her student flat and her parents farm in Denmark. The difference was eye-opening frankly; being used to such an old house with poor insulation, I just assumed that everywhere was like that unless you were very wealthy. Perhaps a poor assumption I know, but it was all I'd experienced.

At my parents, you can feel draughts in a few places and they pretty much need the heating on for 75% of the day when it starts to get REALLY cold, and still need to wear a fleece if you remained downstairs. I have a powerful gaming PC that I also use to run computer algebra computations on for my work that is basically switched on all day doing something (but not usually overnight). My computer heated up my (upstairs) bedroom nicely, but when I walked out of my room I could feel the temperature change, even with my radiator almost always off during the day.

I moved out 2 years ago to my Southampton flat. My computer is now basically the only heating I need and it can get ridiculously hot inside in the summer. It's 22C inside right now and I've not had the heating on yet today and even had the window open for a bit. When the landlords maintenance guy came round to fix something in another flat, I asked about the insulation and he explained to me how they have special thick soundproof insulation in all the walls and between the two floors, and even showed me some of it as he had to pull out a bunch to see what he had to fix. I'm still amazed at how big the difference is between here and the house in which I grew up and as far as I'm aware, many older houses suffer the same problem.

When I stayed with my wife in Denmark I experienced basically the same thing. I was confused as to how I so warm inside despite it heavily snowing outside, and my confusion confused her as it is pretty much the norm there. Conversely, when she came to stay in the UK at my parents house, she was shivering and it was just a regular winters day. She is used to shovelling huge amounts of snow on her parents farm in central Jylland/Jutland in stupidly cold weather, but was asking how the hell it was so cold inside when it was barely below 0C. I've experienced a lovely -20C patch of Danish winter, yet it was still perhaps even too warm inside even during the night, a complete polar opposite to what many in the UK experience.

Sadly, I'm not really sure what can be done about it, as it's not like everyone has a spare chunk of cash to spend on some heavy, property wide insulation.",0,1383238788,null,0,false,0,cd3t2r5,t3_1plqm0,t1_cd3t2r5,t1_cd3mdmr,null,1428911058,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

My takeaway?...you reached the limits of your skill and dipped a foot over. The bike will always be better than you and that fact probably meant you were able to adjust last minute and save your bacon. 

Hope you get some more wheels soon mate, Loughborough....I went to uni there along with my other half...good times! Get your self down to the noodle horse (noodle house) for some consolation Chinese!!

It still might in fairness. 

At the moment while the trial is going on the media will focus on Brooks/Coulson. But the bottom line is - David Cameron employed Andy Coulson within government at a high level... while he was having an affair with the now disgraced head of a major newspaper, both of whom have been implicated in hacking the phone of a dead teenage girl. 

The next logical question will be... Did David Cameron actually know they were having an affair, he is after all a good personal friend of both Rebekah and Charlie Brooks. If the public believe he did, it means Cameron effectively opened up the highest levels of government to one of the seediest organisations on the planet. At best he'll look like a moron and at worst he's effectively stood by two criminals.

If the answer to that question is yes, it means the conservative party have just stepped waist deep in their first big puddle of scandal... about 14 months before election time. Some redditos may not recall, but it was in many ways the continuous stream of apparent scandal and corruption that helped to pull down the last Conservative government.

George Osborne supposedly persuaded David Cameron to hire Andy Coulson in the first place despite it being Coulson's News of the World that first broke the story of him being involved in the soon to be released memoirs of one Mayfairian dominatrix Miss-Whiplash-Rowe, who was the client of Max Clifford  who had his phones hacked but settled out of court on the understanding that he signed a confidentiality agreement.

The story of the dominatrix is itself blown out of proportion by the media, it seems.  The allegation is not that he used her services, at least that's not been claimed, it's that he home dined with her husband and kept their company.  That in itself is not a problem; people almost expect Conservatives to party with largess.  There's no real media stigma to being a champagne Conservative like there is with Champagne socialists.  The problem is how the story first broke and whether Osborne knew that (a) phones were being hacked, or (b) was blackmailed or pressured to press Cameron to hire Coulson who was literally sleeping with the hackers.

They don't. They've [changed the ratings count](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22903701) though since series 7 finished, so we'll see how it plays out then. 

RTD was about as hated as Moffat is today when he was showrunner. Moffat may have the hate edge because many people seem to think that RTD's version of Doctor Who was somehow the ""only true"" version and Moff's interpretation was bad just because it was different. If you look at internet communities with a lot of fans of the classic series like Gallifrey Base you will find that Moffat is even a little more popular than Davies, largely because he still hasn't made any complete rubbish episodes, unlike RTD who has written Aliens in London, Last of the Time Lords (not the first two parts, Utopia was fantastic) and Voyage of the Damned, all absolute lowpoints in the history of Doctor Who. And since you keep bringing up episodes that Moffat hasn't even written: What about Fear Her, Love and Monsters or The Lazarus Experiment? All of those are really quite bad.

Of course there are always different tastes. I would never in a million years understand how anyone could think that The Name of the Doctor was a bad episode. So that's your opinion, fine. But I have to absolutely disagree with one thing: Moffat puts his heart and soul into the show. He's probably the biggest Doctor Who fan on the planet, he loves it to pieces and works his ass of to give us the best show that he always imagined Doctor Who to be. And all while being under the immense pressure of having to please everyone all the time.

Ask a load of questions, you need to learn about what all the lamps do and what purpose they serve and in what situation you will use them. This used to be a lot easier when it was just a load of generics on dimmer channels but moving lights and LED's have replaced the lighting shows of old. [This book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Basics-Beginners-Guide-Stage-Lighting/dp/190403120X) is a good jumping off point.

Once you've got some experience and your foot in the door start asking if they have any paid roles while you search for work with your new found experience.

Once you have learned the following things.

* Lanterns and what they are used for
* Cable, it's applications and how to run it properly
* How to patch a dimmer rack
* How to read a lighting plot
* Fault finding, how to identify a problem quickly and fix it quicker than that

You then need to download [this](http://www.chamsys.co.uk/download) software and learn how to operate a lighting desk. Read the manual and you should have picked up enough to have a good go.

Likely some of these are the same people.

So based on hospital and A&amp;E admissions alone, your £10 would raise £350 million per year, which is not enough to cover the amounts required for compensation.  If you included outpatient appointments, you would get ~£1.2 billion, which is still not enough.


You would have to charge ~£14 for each hospital visit, and tack on a bit extra for overheads, admin, lawyers, etc, etc, so maybe £20 for each and every visit to the hospital.

Now, some people can't afford that, especially if they have a chronic condition that reduces employment opportunities, or are on a small pension, so you would have to increase the amount even more to make up for those who can't pay.

Sure, they have made mistakes. Their first year in charge was horrible. The Carroll transfer, Commolli, overpaying for players like downing, Adam and -to some extent- Henderson (I love him btw). 
They have been taught their lessons, however. Bringing in a manager with a great future ahead of him. Establishing a proper transfer committee. The transfers of Coutinho, Sturridge, Toure, Sakho. Showing the world that we are not going to get bullied by either other clubs or players with the Suarez saga. Not being willing to overpay for any player any more ( how's Willian doing btw?).

No, it to remember those same soldiers who got to the trenches and experienced hell on earth before being slaughtered.

It's absolutely not irrelevant if it's a fundamental condition of membership.

The only way that the United Kingdom gets away with asking other EU citizens to show their passport or identity card to enter is because of:

a) The historic nature of the Common Travel Area with the Republic of Ireland
b) That a) predates Schengen

It may be *conceivable* that the EU will grant an opt-out to Scotland during the accession negotiations, but that's by no means guaranteed as it would need the explicit consent and agreement of every other existing member state.

&gt; The only possible impediment is political-made

Well of course it is, because the fundamental treaties are politically made. 

If you want to join the European Union now then that means open borders and membership of Schengen.

true,Bobinti,k9,K-9,"Okay, viewing figures aside - what about the ratings? Haven't they gone down too?

I don't believe RTD's episodes are the ""only true"" ones, but I believe the show was better during that time. To be honest, some of my favourite episodes from series 1-4 were The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances and Blink (probably my all time favourite story ever)(and all Moffat). 

During series 7 it feels like the stories were too rushed, and there are so. many. plotholes. I'm 100% sure Steve does put a lot of effort into the show, but series 7 really lacked the feel of 'heart and soul'. The lack of 2-parters and the rushed endings proved that for me. I do take into the consideration that Stevey was also writing Series 3 of Sherlock and the 50th Anniversary of the show, but that doesn't change the fact that series 7 just felt bad.

I don't believe Russel was the absolute God send for the show, but I feel like he put a lot more heart and soul into it (the whole Sarah Jane Adventures and Torchwood thing gives me that impression), even when he was under immense pressure (the whole revival of the show must have been hectic - but ""Rose"" was possibly one of the best stories in the history of the show).

Basically what I'm saying is that I feel like Moffat wrote a lot better when he wasn't under much pressure (I much prefer his work in series 1-4 than in series 5-7), and now that he is under a lot of pressure, the feeling of 'heart of soul' into the show doesn't seem to be there anymore.

As for the viewing ratings for Series 8: I'm sure they would be much higher anyway, for 3 reasons:

1) The 50th Anniversary will attract much more viewers due to the hype
2) There is a brand new Doctor, and new Doctor episodes usually get a lot of viewers. Also Peter Capaldi is very famous, so many of his fans will probably want to start watching, too.
3) Steve wont under as much pressure

&gt;I want to point out a couple of things r/soccer and spurs fans dont seem to realize. 

&gt; 1. Lamela has been great these past two years, constantly improving (excluding the second half of last season) and showed lots of talent, but he was probably our most inconsistent player throughout the season.

&gt; 2. Most of Lamelas goals came in the beginning of the season when Zeman just threw everyone up top. Most of Osvaldo's too for that matter. Guess who was scoring for us in the second half of the season when we had a more balanced team? Well we didn't score much.. but Florenzi and Totti (who woulda thought) were crucial.

&gt; 3. You are not buying a superstar. You are buying a fantastic prospect who is quite shy and will need time to adapt to the epl, the new team, and life in England in general, remember Argentina to Italy isn't really much of a shock.

Being near making a block or tackle counts for nothing by the way. It's the block or tackle that a defender is bought for and makes the ultimate difference - franpr95

You want to make hardware? Do electronics engineering.
You want to teach at a school? Do ICT.
You want to learn for the love of it? Then you do CS.

There are trainee positions available but they're rare and the salary is smaller.
