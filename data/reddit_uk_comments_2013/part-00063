true,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,"Agree there. 

As for 

&gt;As to what happens to Henderson &amp; Shelvey, I think that'll depend on what happens to Downing. If he goes, there'll be a spot for players to rotate there. If he stays I could see 2-3 of Shelvey, Suso and Sterling going out on loans. 

I hope he stays for at least another season, for the very reason you mention: I really don't like the idea of Shelvey/Henderson playing on the wing. Firstly, they are yet to have a game where I think ""my, that was a great wide display"". At best they have been ""well... did fairly well for a central player forced to play out wide"". A bit like Skrtel at RB. 

Shelvey and Henderson's futures lie in central midfield and whilst some players, Downing and Enrique to name the most recent examples, benefit from experience 'elsewhere' on the pitch, I think it is hurting those two. I would much rather see them develop their game as future CM/AMs, be it with us or on loan. 

Both of them feel a bit wasted out wide and their tendency to drift towards their natural positions often leaves us vulnerable. Of course, you can argue that positional discipline should be drilled into them, nevertheless, I do not see the point in drilling it into players who will never be good wingers when we have, for our purposes, a perfectly adequate winger in the side already and a credible wide operation in Sterling, Coutinho, Suarez, Borini and, perhaps from next season, young Ibe. 

As for Suso, file that one firmly under 'to be loaned out' in my book. ",0,1364909674,null,0,false,0,c96xk67,t3_1bich6,t1_c96xk67,t1_c96xd16,null,1431700538,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

true,thatsgirlstuff,null,null,"I really enjoyed the rules, too. You got a sense that even if you, the viewer, didn't understand the rules all of the time that they were there and the Doctor had his reasons. 

I found that time having certain parameters despite its wibbly-wobbliness prompted me to think about the universe and time. It reminded me of articles and reading I'd done or philosophical ideas that i'd come across before and I really liked that. Things seem a bit more supernatural and a bit less sciency now than before. It's just a direction that I'm not particularly fond of as I've never really gotten into fantasty-esque stories or shows. 

I like the fact that Matt Smith's Doctor is very curious about everything, but it seems to lack some overarching ""cleverness"". He seems almost like an idiot savante and while some people may be really into that kind of character, it just really doesn't do it for me. It feels very Dr. Seuss at times. 

And yes, the show seems to be much more about the companions and about their relationships within that little system than about anything on the outside. I used to like how we would episodically meet characters who may or may not reappear later on and really get an idea for their character in a short amount of time. That made it feel much more like an adventure show for me. Then you learned, in turn, a lot about the companions and the doctor because of the ways that they interacted with the other characters. 

So many components (the plot points, emotions, motivations, jokes) are so obvious now that it's not as engaging for me. There are also fewer grey areas and fewer times that I find myself asking ""was that fair?"" or ""was it okay to let all of those people die because it was a fixed point in time?"" or whatever. The newer episodes don't make me think about anything greater. They just make everyone focus on things like cracks in walls and clues/occurrences *within* the Who universe. 

Sci-fi was always fun for me because it could take on really difficult questions and evaluate multiple answers because of its seemingly distant setting.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Even those that do aren't necessarily stupid. I mean, I'd say capitalism is bad.

The fundamental problem is the private ownership of communal resources - the land, minerals, oil, waterways, etc. that should be common to us all, for they are the product of no-one's labour. This means that people are denied their common inheritance in these resources (whilst some reap all the profits) and this is the cause of the great inequality in the world (nowhere is this clearer than the Third World which is rich in resources, and yet whose people are left in dire poverty). If it were possible they would have bottled and sold the air, and people would claim it is ""their air"" and could not possibly be shared for the benefit of all, whilst millions lived in needless poverty as they struggled to pay for their monthly air allowance. This is the exact situation we face with regards to the other natural resources, and there is really no defence for it, their claims to own the natural resources are as absurd as claiming to own the Moon or the stars.

But this has other effects too, as the private ownership of the factories, etc. means we have this current system of wage labour. However, this means that every business wants to extract the maximum profit from each employee, and so when the demand for labour is decreasing (due to automation) and the supply is increasing (due to outsourcing, immigration, etc.) this results in ever increasing inequality, as it results in simultaneous unemployment and overwork (as you can't complain about working conditions when there are 5 million people ready to replace you). There is a great waste of human potential in underemployment too, as millions are employed in unnecessary labour because it is cheaper than automating the work or necessary to provide competition. This is insanity when we could educate and employ all people and relieve the work burden on all.

Then there's the problem of globalisation, which means that the multinational corporations can play the nations off against eachother to get lower taxes and worse working conditions. This undermines democracy as it does not matter which government is in power when they must do whatever the corporations wish, or face the loss of their vital investment and employment, and so we end up with lower and lower corporation taxes, and a loss in public services like universal healthcare, higher education, etc. meanwhile fundamentally our society is wealthier than ever before - we have the best technology we have ever had and the highest productive capacity we have ever had. This is madness too. The private ownership of the mass media in a few hands also undermines democracy quite clearly, which Einstein covered well in [_Why Socialism?_](http://monthlyreview.org/598einstein.php)

Then there's the problem of economic instability, as the great concentration of wealth means that we rely upon the capitalists creating adequate credit to keep the economy moving. However, this is like a group of people building a house of cards, in which they are all sitting ready to grab their cards out in case it begins to collapse (this fear creates a collapse in itself). Severe recessions happen because the great inequality means the purchasing power of the masses drops below the point at which they can afford to buy the goods being produced at profitable prices, and so businesses have to make redundancies to remain profitable which worsens the crisis. We used easily available credit to try to offset this, but eventually the debt itself becomes unprofitable when there is no chance of redeeming it and the property isn't worth enough to seize and sell (especially in a collapse when all the properties are foreclosed and the prices crash), such a system built upon great inequality will never be stable, it is like building a pyramid based upon its tip. 

And finally there are the environmental problems. A major one relates to the structure of the economic system, for example, the private management of farms, etc. in to individual, selfish businessmen's hands means that each farmer is only concerned with maximising their own gains, and so they will use abundant fertiliser (ignoring the damage eutrophication can cause to wildlife), use the same maximised growth and consumer friendly strains of plants (risking crises in the case of agricultural disease), etc., as there is no management of the big picture.

And there is also the Tragedy Of The Commons as people only seek to maximise their own profit and so will happily exhaust communal resources, or even private resources if it makes them more money in their own lives. We can't really leave such vital management in the hands of private individuals who will make selfish decisions, when the consequences will effect the whole of humanity for generations. 

The case for a system of collective ownership of the Earth's resources, with a democratically based, scientific approach to management is clearer than ever before. All of these problems are ultimately the result of the private ownership of resources. We should aim to build a society we would all accept before we knew our place in it, no-one would wish to be a sweatshop worker or a poor farmhand now, and such great inequality should not exist at all.

By law both the UK and Japan require you to be living there (though as Godwinspeed said there is a leeway of at least a year), so yes, you are supposed to forfeit your license if you move between countries.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yep, I think that Doctor Who actually has a higher per-episode budget, but it has to spend a lot of it on locations, special effects and all the costumes/sets for the spacey things whereas Sherlock has repeating sets, then usually one main new set per episode, with very little post-production special effects (the main bits being all the words and stuff, which are easy compared to making a TARDIS explode, for example), so they can afford to spend more of their post-production budget on editing to make it look slick.

Some of the ""smoothest"" Doctor Who episodes are the ones that had only one or two sets, and therefore were cheaper to make comparatively (Girl in the Fireplace only had Reinette's bedroom, that room with the mirror and the spaceship which was also used for other episodes, for example, so they could put a lot of time and energy into making those sets perfect).

So yeah, it's like how a sitcom/romcom movie won't need half the budget that an action movie needs, because it has less set, less post-production special effects, less special effects while filming, less weird costumes (most of the extras on Sherlock will just be wearing their own clothes, whereas on Doctor Who they have to be wearing special costumes unless it's modern-day), and just less costly elements in general.",0,1364913476,null,0,false,0,c96yl0w,t3_1bi0xm,t1_c96yl0w,t1_c96uqdf,null,1431700055,1,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,1

It has a time and place, but I don't want that time and place to be Doctor Who. That was actually one of the few times with 10 that I went ""WHAT THE F?! That's the lamest thing ever."" was when he defeated the Master just because everybody at the same time thought about him and you know, about how awesome he was because he always saved everybody. It was entirely too magical lame for me. I feel like we see that a lot more often now. 

I also like your point about Matt's Doctor being a sort of idiot savante thing going on. In rewatching 10's stuff he says he's ""clever"" a LOT. Almost to the point that if he wasn't truly as awesome as he says he is you'd think he was a stuck up jerk. I think I like how that's the Doctor. There's a bit of dumb luck to it, sure, but at the heart of it - he's really, really clever. He makes brainy seem sexy. I loved that. He was like a super hero not because of his strength but more often than not, his smarts. 

Sure he's got the Tardis and that helps - but really, it's how gosh darn smart he is. Not that 11 isn't smart. He just seems more often than not a bit, well, bumbling? Like he's just trying a bunch of stuff until something works. I'm not sure exactly why he comes off that way to me. 

I LOVE the idea of ""all of time and space."" That is what draws me to this show. The awe of it. The vastness of it. The possibilities. Limitless. Something about these newer episodes, I don't know.

true,TheMania,null,null,"We ought ensure that everyone that is willing to work is able to earn a living wage.

Whilst you're right that lowering the minimum wage might help a few more people find employment, it changes the symptoms of the crisis we have before us (insufficient jobs brought about by insufficient spending) from one kind, unemployment, to another - working poor.

Your solution is that we ought lower wages, dividing up that insufficient spending between more people. Changing the crisis from insufficient jobs, to insufficient decent paying jobs. A far better solution is rather than split insufficient spending between more people, to instead boost spending - create jobs until there's enough that labour is no longer in over supply. That way each willing worker ought be able to make a living wage.

Taking the create more jobs approach (ie ending austerity) is not incompatible with lifting the minimum wage, although personally I agree we ought end the minimum wage. Not because I want to see working poor, but rather because I believe a [job guarantee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_guarantee) to be vastly superior. A job guarantee offers all willing workers a job at a fixed wage, whilst not prohibiting them from working for more or less than that wage if they desire to (ie in higher paying private sector employment or for low paid work they enjoy/perhaps the family business) without creating a welfare trap.

A job guarantee prevents a crisis of insufficient jobs from ever presenting, we're never left underbidding each other in a race to the bottom to see which of the 100 available workers are willing to work for the least pay from the 90 available jobs. That's the problem your solution has - that if there ever is an insufficient number of jobs - and there is - your solution requires wages to fall until some give up looking for a job (and/or resort to crime) and others become working poor. A minimum wage stops that race to the bottom, but leaves more people unemployed in total (your criticism) - a job guarantee though ends the jobs crisis.

I have had it explained to me that this is allowed to happen because each individual student/student group has the right to there own opinion, which is fine, I support that. But I find it odd that the union, allows groups to use its premises for groups focused on this issue. 

Then, when Aisling here tries to assert her own opinion, she is removed as the delegate? Maybe they will argue because the delegates represent the Union directly, but to anyone not aware of the goings on behind the union, walking through the union building that day would of given the opinion that Queens was very pro-life.

Cheapest return ticket probably around £70 if you avoid peak travel times.

At the Cardiff side - if you can get off at the Cardiff Bay train station, the DWE is a 10-minute walk from there, or maybe a 25-minute walk from Cardiff Central (or you can grab a taxi, or one of the regular Cardiff Bay buses if you prefer). There are a handful of other things which may be worth seeing in Cardiff - there's a very nice castle, and there are frequent events like open air concerts and such, depending on the timing of your visit.

Every time I've flown to/from Cardiff Airport I've always found it to be quite small - I've only ever used it for domestic flights, and wasn't even sure it handled international traffic. This may or may not be a good thing - e.g. I suspect getting in and out of Cardiff Airport by car is probably a lot easier/quicker than Heathrow or Gatwick, if the option is available, but flights in &amp; out will be a lot less frequent.

true,Variola13,null,null,"&gt;f this mismanagement is so ongoing, and there have been previous protests, then it doesn't take a genius to see that they University is not listening, therefore their method of protesting isn't working.

Short of buggering the VC with a marrow I don't think anything will work, I am pretty sure most of the protesters know that too. But protests to change things is not the same as protesting to make a point, which essentially is what most protests like this are about. The management have cut essential staff while raising the wages of management and hiring another layer of management, this is in addition to outsourcing the jobs. They have also sacked lecturers/researchers which did effect the teaching in the end. The students are pretty pissed at the attitude that they are an 'aside' rather than the important bread and butter of the university. 

&gt;If I get an infection and take antibiotics, and they don't work, my GP suggests another. You don't carry on with something that's ineffective just because it bolsters your ego and makes you feel important. They're tried ""occupying"", it's not worked. Maybe they should try something else?

There is some truth in that view, however I think it is misleading to paint all of the protesters as like that, or all of them as having  enough time to occupy buildings because their degree is not 'hard'. 

For me the protest has been a pain in the arse, power outage when machines are running experiments is not my idea of fun. But I still respect and support why they are doing it.

Kelly seems to have a greater idea of what is going on and has the hunger to learn about the squad. I think he, Coates, and Skrtel are going to be all competing for the starting job which might make them all a little better. 

There is no need for another striker. Sow, while good, is simply not needed. We have Borini who is 22, Sturridge who is 23, Suarez who is 26(?), Yesil who is 18, and Ibe who is 16. Fast forward 5 years. We have Borini who is 27, Sturridge who is 28, Suarez who is 31, Yesil who is 23, and Ibe who is 21.

true,satanspanties,,President of the Official Stellar Tortoise FC Fan Club,"Moffat's single episodes are still brilliant.  But larger story arcs seem to have lost their way somewhat.

Take what he did to the weeping angels.  In *Blink*, they had so much mystery and there was no way to really fight them, they were amazing.  In the *Time of Angels* and *Flesh and Stone* they completely changed their behaviour, which I understood in the context of the episode, but until then, I had thought of them as hunters, not creatures that made coherent plans.  I had adjusted to that by the time *The Angels Take Manhattan* came along, and the thought of them intentionally ""farming"" humans was a brilliant one, but then they thoroughly jumped the shark as a monster by the Statue of Liberty being an angle.  I'm sure you've seen the plot holes opened up by that one discussed at length.

Secondly, it doesn't seem like he really knows what to do with River Song any more. She's gone from this strong, independent, mysterious woman to... what?  Obviously the mystery was going to have to be solved sooner or later, but having lost that aspect, she seems to have lost her way as a character somewhat.

The Eleventh Doctor also seems to have less depth to his character than the Ninth or Tenth did.  The whole ""mad man in a box"" thing sometimes feels like it's all there is to him, he's eccentric for the sake of being eccentric.  This seems to be improving since he's lost the Ponds; we shall see, I suppose.

There is also a *lot* of annoyance at having series split up and separated the way that they have been, accusations that he seems to only be able to write one type of female character, and the feeling that many of the more recent stories have trite or unsatisfying conclusions relying on concept like love and memory, rather than the Doctor having a plan.

I don't think all these things can be put down to Moffat alone.  There are other writers on Doctor Who, and other producers.  The splitting of the series into two parts may be completely out of his control, who knows what the inner workings of the BBC are.  But I do think that many of these concerns are valid, and the reason Moffat as executive producer is paid so much is that he is the man who ultimately takes responsibility for these things in the eyes of the fans.

Personally, I find the more recent series' frequent reliance on ""extraordinary people"", the power of love and memories much cheesier than some of what we had before, although I will freely admit that certain scenes and lines under Davies definitely had something of a slitony whiff about them.

I actually disagree that Moffat wrote the *best* episodes.  He certainly consistently writes *good* ones, but my two all time favourites are *Midnight*, written by Davies, because it was interesting to see the Doctor so out of his element and the monster was both terrifying and never revealed, and *The Doctor's Wife*, written by Neil Gaiman, which I will freely admit was mostly fan-service.

I think the series under Moffat lost it's way a little bit, but not nearly to the extent that much of Reddit seems to think it has.  I'm optimistic that the coming series will find a happy medium.

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"I do think it's a similar formation, but I'm not sure that the roles are the same.  I think, especially in his last year, that there was a big disconnect between attack and midfield at LFC.  Gerrard was playing very advanced and Rafa played with true wingers (in their roles, not necessarily true wing players--Kuyt is a great example).  That created a gap between SG-Torres and Alonso-Mascherano.  For me, the difference is that you had, I'd say, the world's best CDM at the time help Xabi do his job.  So they were sort of stacked, with Alonso responsible for winning possession back around midfield and Mascherano playing deeper and more directly as a shield for the back 4, using Alonso as his immediate outlet when he won possession back.

At Madrid, he has Khedira as his defensive cover and Modric in the center of the park.  I've not seen as much of him since he moved to Spain, but Modric was more box-to-box at Spurs, so I'm assuming he typically will help cover some ground in the middle, so Alonso has two others to help bear the burden.

Anyway, that is less important.  But I just don't think Xabi is the CDM that some here think he is.

true,frankster,null,null,"What I mean is that there might be a fixed amount of demand for fast food which isn't very sensitive to the price of the fast food. That is, if a cheeseburger cost 10p more the quantity sold would not change.

If this was the case, the fast food company could easily pay a higher minimum wage and put the price of cheeseburgers up, without changing the number of employees. (The min wage government policy would basically mandate that cheeseburger eaters subsidise a higher wage for fast food workers...so there would be cheeseburger price inflation which was matched by increased spending by fast food workers. )

On the other hand, if demand for cheeseburgers is really sensitive to price, an increase of price by 10p might reduce demand by 5 or 10%. In this case, one might expect that putting the minimum wage up would require some job losses.

You are assuming the second case. But it might be closer to the first case. It all depends on the price elasticity of hamburgers which is not given.

Not least territorial integrity, shared cultural identity, manpower and resources. I wouldn't get too swept up in Scots independence. It's come at a bad time with the economy and the fact an unpopular labour government gave rise to an equally unpopular conservative coalition. But all the evidence suggests independence in Scotland is a non-starter. Because whilst the economic argument appears to be pretty moot, the uncertainty it brings to those issues I discussed above outweighs the nationalistic benefits. If anything, I would say the lesson from Scotland is you can pretty much discard economics as ultimately both side of the debate will distort the truth to such a point, nobody really knows which option is economically superior. Instead, the real driver for Scots independence has been a nationalistic party gaining power - and the benefit of doing it at a time when a predominantly English-voted Tory government is in power.

http://allrecipes.co.uk/recipe/5155/irish-champ.aspx

The key to a good champ is not to mash the potatoes to oblivion-don't use a potato ricer as that makes them almost glutinous, good champ is relatively smooth but still has body and is firm. And lots and lots of butter-proper full fat butter, none of your olive oil or low fat spreads, it has to be real butter (you can never have too much). Season well with salt and pepper, if you're feeling fancy add chopped parsley. The spring onions (or scallions) are chopped very finely-they need minimal cooking, in fact they are only warmed through before adding to the pototoes and it is the heat of the spuds that cooks the onion. 

Usually champ is served with sausages-I tend to build a volcano shape of champ and have three sausages lined up down the sides which looks pretty before you start pigging out...It sounds like superchamp has the sausages mixed in with the champ which probably isn't necessary as I think the brown sausage would take away from the creamy purity of champ, but I suppose you could get some good quality sausages, grill them (don't prick them before grilling or they'll lose their moisture and dry out). Once evenly cooked, slice into chunks and stir through. 

Adding parsnip sounds like an abomination to me-seriously, parsnip?? Its very sweet and would offset the oniony savoury goodness, but if I was asked to adulterate my champ with parsnip, I would cook it separately, boiled until soft enough to mash and then stir into the champ.

Well, I've given up sugar coating everything because it shouldn't be necessary, hence the ""Grown Up"" comment. People should be able to evaluate an argument without first having to have their ego stroked or their feelings reassured.

As it is at this point, I'd need to say things like:

*""Guys I'm not a tory and actually think they're a bunch of knobs, and I fully support the NHS and the notion of a welfare state, but in this case don't you just think that perhaps the university (END TUITION FEES NOW) may with the budget they've got (which is tiny because the tories are underfunding education!) may be forced to reduce the salary of its support staff (at least for a while till we get a better government) in order to carry on providing teaching for thousands of young aspiring students""*

But you know what? Fuck it, I shouldn't have to do all that reassuring just to make the point that the uni might be in the right to cut wages for support staff (essentially what they're doing). There's too much childish bullshit whereby if you agree with any single one action which people don't like, they assume you agree with everything they don't like, not to mention a lack of seriousness about the fact the the country is skint and that every time you spend more money in one place you take it away from another place.

&gt;Scattergun ranting about leftists-this and liberals-that is as tiresome as the hard-left uncritically decrying anything not covered by the worldview as fascist, surely you can understand that?

I could say the same about ""unerring free-marketeer"" lines ;) To be truthful in general I avoid reference to the whole leftist/rightist thing because it's generally a bad sign if a debate gets to those points, it signals that people have started putting each other in camps and basing all of their views of that person on their perception of that camp, not on the views actually expressed by that person -  however I've found that happening to myself so much recently (for instance, I agree notionally with the under-occupancy penalty although not with its specific implementation - this leads to a lot of people instantly treating me like I want to take all disabled people out into the country and shoot them - this *childish* bullshit about the tories ""hating"" the poor or the disabled is just ridiculous, people should be ashamed for saying such utterly idiotic things).

I don't think it is, I mean, I really think that with a lot of people they have to feel like I'm on *their* side before they'll accept any point whatsoever. If they think I'm on the *other* side they'll instantly dismiss my viewpoint, and a lot of the time anything and everything else I say too. I shouldn't have to apologetically propose every last point in order for people to look at them maturely and reasonably.

&gt;Much better for me to look critically at the points you make, when I don't think you're perpetually outraged at everything under the sun.

We discuss the issues that come up, we don't discuss the issues which are uninteresting :)

&gt;As for the Tories 'hating' the poor, I think it's more accurate to say they are ideologically steered to view poverty as predominantly a fault of the individual rather than a failing of a society that aspires to be just.

Certainly, I agree. That is not ""hating"" though, and yet you see so commonly these days people say such an idiotic thing and it gets support. It's the dialectical step above throwing faeces at things that make you feel bad inside.

&gt;overblown rhetoric the Government has been spouting

So far I've seen an awful lot of people talk about the overblown rhetoric and harsh language the government uses, people claiming they're called lazy and so forth, and yet I don't really see the government actually doing this. This could be just that I don't read enough newspapers, but I think there's such a common acceptance that the tories ""hate"" the poor and other such stereotypes that people get away with saying a lot of stuff which isn't true but which nonetheless reinforces their own prejudices against the tories and other right-of-labour parties.

I would rather Piazon or De Bruyne were given the opportunities he receives. They're better players with far more potential. It's part of a wider problem at the club where the younger players that we're developing don't get enough first team experience at the club, no chances to surprise and impress.

Take Kakuta, for instance. I think it's too late for him, unfortunately, although he's doing well at Vitesse. Despite not having successful Premier League loan spells he did well in France last season. We've spent time and considerable money helping him develop, yet haven't afforded him any chances in the first team.

Kakuta was way more trouble than he was worth right from the get go. Caused so much unnecessary shit for our club and was overrated. I think he is rubbish and hope he never comes back to our club.

But I'm not a fan of high wingers, having midfielder is more important and effective than running down the flanks and wiping in crosses. Especially with the players we have. So I went with the single pivot. The two biggest changes being putting oscar farther back in the top three and moving rammy to the flanks. In the double pivot we constantly see 1 or two players (super Frank and El Motto) leaving either Mikel or each other exposed from forward runs. Dropping back Oscar slightly would theoretically provide more cover against the counter for the holding midfielder (I think Lampsy would be suited for the role as well) but he will this be with hazard as they pass so well between each other. There is some disagreement on this sub about Rammy being better for the right wing or CM. I'd say he's a sub for either. Everyone agree his forte is his blinding pace and work rate.

The current UK government has an election pledge to drastically reduce the number of immigrants coming into the country -- this pledge is still unmet and, crucially, the government is currently being challenged electorally by a strongly anti-immigration party (UKIP) which means that if anything the entry requirements are only going to get tougher over the next couple of years.

There are basically three categories of visa still available if you don't have an EEA country's citizenship:

* Get offered a job in the UK paying over £150,000 -- there are no visa restrictions for the super-rich.

* Get a job with a company in the USA that also has UK offices and get an intra-company transfer -- these sort of visas are relatively straightforward for the employer to obtain

* Try to find a job yourself. Note that this is not easy: even if you're offered a job, unless it's on the [Shortage Occupation List](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/workingintheuk/shortageoccupationlistnov11.pd) (PDF link) then you won't be offered a visa.

The full set of immigration rules are on the [UKBA](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/) website. And there are plenty of people who have been down these routes before on /r/IWantOut, it's well worth x-posting there.""

true,[deleted],null,null,"I don't think that your general ideas are off the mark but there are some problems with your proposal.

&gt;So I went with the single pivot.

By definition that is not a thing. 

&gt;Dropping back Oscar slightly would theoretically provide more cover against the counter for the holding midfielder.

Would it? This would basically mean that Oscar has a very limited role and could never be out of position because there is no one to cover him. He would just have to be running back to where Mikel is all of the time otherwise a 3 man midfield would absolutely dominate the game against us. 

To be honest the formation you posted doesn't really make sense, we could never really be setup in that shape for large portions of a game, which is what I would consider a formation to be.

It seems that what you are trying to solve is the midfield problem we have in which the two central 'holding' midfielders don't communicate well and there ends up being large gaps in our midfielder. You want to solve this by leaving Mikel as a dedicated defensive player, which is fair. In the formation you posted though, controlled midfield possession is just not possible without Juan Mata dropping back, and the only place he can drop back to is Oscar's position, which is already occupied. 

Midfield possession and transition is a game of triangles because that is what allows you to beat a pressing line of players. If a team setup in a 4-3-3 against us [like so](http://imgur.com/lSakPig) then they would just run through our midfield all game. 

The 4-2-3-1 is favored because you can play your best attacking players centrally and keep those triangles when both [attacking](http://imgur.com/wmMiQMK) and [transitioning out of defense](http://imgur.com/Jlxyjfd).

In my opinion our problems with the 4231 comes from 3 primary issues:

1. Personnel - We are missing the dynamic holding-type midfielders to play this role. Guys like Khedira, Alonso, Bastian Schweinsteiger...We are missing a proper balance of attack, distribution, and defense. Right now it seems we don't have a single midfielder who can do all three. Potentially we could be okay if we had a midfielder who could keep possession and keep the ball moving well enough. Someone like Modric playing next to a defensive guy like Mikel. We would have to worry less about quick transitions against us because we wouldn't get caught out as much.

2. Poor pressing of the opposition midfield tempo-setters - This formation allows a lot of room for deep-lying playmakers to control the game around us. Against Juventus and Arsenal we deployed Oscar in the #10 role to defend this and it worked wonders. We should do this much more often IMO. 

3. Compactness- Benitez loves to yell the word compact from the sidelines but I've yet to see us do it consistently. All too often this season our forwards are pressing high but our defense is sitting deep. When you have Mikel and Lamapard running that midfield it is just wayyyy to much space for them to cover.

Now if we wanted to try and fix this using your ideas (giving Ramires more space, using a lone holder, dropping Oscar back, keeping a centralized attack) there are a a few options, but we need a bit more balance than what you suggested. I think two potential formations you could explore are [a Christmas tree](http://www.zonalmarking.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/christmas_tree_formation.jpg), which uses three central midfielders and two attacking midfielders ([alternative](http://www.zonalmarking.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/football_tactics_trequartista.jpg)), or a [Diamond](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Association_football_4-4-2_diamond_formation.svg).

If you don't think anything sky shows is worth watching, why do you pirate it? 

You can own the right to distribute something and we've had copyright laws to deal with copyright theft since before modern printing. I doubt the licence covers people watching through neighbours windows, probably because it's such a shitty way to watch things, it won't lead to society deciding to give up on paying for a licence.

Both involve infringing on the private property rights of others. Did you bother learning about the free rider problem? To answer your last question, the opening of the digital spectrum and lower costs for the likes of Netflix and amazon is enabling more competition than ever before (which is why I keep coming back to the point of more channels bring a good thing).

Higher demand is exactly what the economy needs. Business fail and jobs are not created because there is no demand. And this lack of demand is not caused by lack of needs or wants, but lack of purchasing power.

You seem to not account for the incentive to increase production and supply when your demand increases. Prices only increase when supply fails to meet the demand, and shouldn't it be a goal to meet all essential demands?

That falls into the '[Unlawful Act Manslaughter](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/h_to_k/homicide_murder_and_manslaughter/#unlawful)' category.

The only other way a murder charge would be successful is if it could be shown that the children's deaths were a virtual certainty of the starting of the fire, and that those who started it foresaw that risk. Again, there wasn't evidence to back either of those components (especially the latter).

A manslaughter charge is appropriate in law, and still carries a potential life sentence (but unlike murder this is not mandatory). I am fairly confident that Mrs Justice Thirlwall will be handing down a long sentence, but we shall have to wait and see.

If you have a lot of credit available to you - lets say a £1000 unused overdraft, 3 unused credit cards at £2000 each, that means you are able to rack up a debt of £7000 instantaneously.

Lets say one day you want to take £7000 finance deal for a car. This unused credit has to be taken into account by the lender.

The lender will see your earnings and know that you can easily afford the loan repayments. They see your credit history is good. But they will also see that you have £7000 of unused credit.

As a responsible lender they have to consider the possibility that you will take the £7000 car loan, and splash out on all your cards at once. There is a chance of your new loan being declined for this reason.

true,loveandmoney,1986,,"Have you every played Football Manager? If so you will be familiar with the dilemma of having a top quality backup keeper. This is why no club in the world, no matter how big or rich, has two world class goalkeepers. It is such a consistent and unique role that you can only ever afford to have one main guy and then an understudy. Look at Tottenham and Lloris and Friedel, even though Friedel was on a brilliant run of form and had gone something crazy like 200 games played consecutively they eventually edged him out.

In an ideal world, Cech would be our number 1 for another 3 or 4 seasons and then Courtois who would be approaching his prime as a GK would come in. But in reality he isn't going to wait that long, you can't just loan a player out *every* season until he is needed, it is ridiculous and unsustainable.

So it boils down to this: is the gamble of losing Cech prematurely, worth the gamble of getting Courtois ahead of his time and waiting to see if he becomes as good as Cech.

My personal opinion is that we should keep Cech for a long time yet (keepers stay good long into their 30's) and if Courtois can't wait that long (and I wouldn't blame him) then sadly we would have to sell him rather than loan him out year after year until his contract ends.",0,1364940793,null,0,false,0,c978rwi,t3_1bf3ba,t1_c978rwi,t1_c978fdf,null,1431695182,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

We've seen her regenerate twice, once from a child to, unknown as it cut out. *Impossible Astronaut*.
Once from Mel, I believe in *Let's Kill Hitler* to the River we know and recognize.

Possibly more between Astronaut and Hitler off-screen. Can't be sure, just an assumption by the fact the *Mel* character was very young and aged the same as her parents at the time, yet the little girl regenerated in 1970-ish?
But who am I to judge time-lord aging. 

On her age. Not a clue. Time travelers, you just can't measure it unless we're told. 

Time spent away from Doc in a nutshell?
.Child before regeneration in astronaut = Spent with Silence.
.After astronaut before Mel = Likely still spent with silence being raised and programmed after being found by the space suit which tries to eat her.
.Mel time = Now programmed, put into school time with her mother, etc, programmed to activate upon regeneration.
River young = Poisoned Doctor, saved him, forgiven, gone to university to become archaeologist.
River mid = Put in prison for murder.
River old = In prison, leaves occasionally with Doctor, also possible leaves with Vortex Manipulator *Unsure, I'd have to watch Smiths' few series.
River older = Pardoned after Doctor is no longer recognized as existing due to the paradox created by his return to the shadows and so on.
River older still = Unknown. 

See it's all wibbly wobbly timey wimey.

We've yet to find out about the screwdriver form the library, or see this new suit and haircut she described him turning up in when he gives her said screwdriver. But, I could be being picky. Also, I'm assuming that canonically the day River described about *The Doctor just appearing knowing everything about her*, is Let's Kill Hitler, as, officially she's the River we know then, and, the Doctor, well, knows all about her. That and if I recall she receives her Tardis Diary to keep track from that day on and The Doctor explains spoilers and such right?


Eh, that's all I have for now. I haven't watched through Smith series' in over 6 months so I'm out of the loop somewhat. But as far as I'm aware, I'm not missing any major plot lines here. We've seen her death in the library, her genuine birth in *Goes to War*, and the River regen birth in *Hitler*. So we've seen her first and last day. 

Yeh we're missing a fair bit still, mostly the end of her story, I doubt we'll learn more about the start any time soon. Although, at the back of my mind, I have this feeling River mentions being the little girl from the *Astronaut/Moon* episodes during *Let's Kill Hitler*, so I'm unsure about the whole time period there. She could age slowly, or time travel, so it's still likely she's only regenerated the twice we know of.

You're just making excuses for inaction while claiming that voting could change something. If you can't be fucked, fine, I don't blame you but don't pretend that people who don't vote are missing the opportunity to change things. 

Plenty of people are making the effort to do things in a different way.

&gt;and that can work fine to an extent, the issue is that for that possibility you need to get rid of the government (or reduce it at least) before you start, not after.

Well, you can't get rid of the government by voting. I hope that somehow people will get the inspiration to undermine the system before it crushes us.

&gt;
&gt;In fact it's rental costs. Private rents shot up by an average of £300 last year. No wonder 5 million people need housing benefits, but they don't keep a penny. It all goes to landlords.

For fucks sake.  Housing benefit IS part of the problem.  The current housing benefit system is contributing to the rise in rental costs due to the government essentially subsidising it.  With a lack of council housing  and housing in general alongside an increase of money available at the bottom end of the housing market, the only result is that rents go up.    The government is essentially inflating the rental market for no net benefit.

What we need to do to combat this is to build and provide cheap publicly owned housing with rental costs far below that of the current rental market, and build a shit load of these houses.

A worthy statement.  UK is approximately 3.3% black.  There's a kind of innate desire to have people to look up to that look like you.  It seems that we humans feel a natural kinship towards those that look similar to ourselves.  I can see how she might be sad about not having dolls etc. that 'looked like her when she was a kid.  

Still, 3.3% isn't that high, and given the demographic has increased by 40% since 2001, is it reasonable to assume black faces are few and far between because of prejudice or because of simple statistics?

The people who succumb to the monster believe a higher being controls their fate, and the beast feeds off their fear by there being a room containing each person's greatest fear.

Rory quickly finds an exit door leading out of the hotel that goes unseen by everyone else. The Doctor later explains that it's because Rory has no faith. The Doctor also says something about Amy having no faith, but wait, she has faith in the Doctor, and so he shakes her of that faith.

Rita, one of the other characters, notes the Doctor has a 'god complex' because he's trying to save everyone.

You could read faith to mean something other than an association with gods, but to a fair number of people, the implication was clear -- Rory and Amy are atheists.

The article was about the negative rhetoric used by section of the media and some politicians:

""An attempt to support and encourage unemployed Britons can turn into hostility against the EU, companies that outsource and unfortunately immigrants hoping to contribute to Britain"" 
""Many of us read articles taking opinions and statistics as the gospel truth without realising that articles can contain bias"", 
""Politicians often adopt slogans such as 'British jobs, for British people,' as opposed to advocating less low skilled immigration, a promise of more jobs, or better education and training for Britons."" 
""Mr Sheerman later clarified that he wishes the British residents of Huddersfield would get job opportunities before “someone who arrived from Eastern Europe yesterday.” Yet according to the Telegraph, ""those immigrants who do “take” British jobs are temporary, non-EU workers – many are young Australians, Canadians and so on with working holiday visas, rather than Polish plumbers.”

In terms of the myth that all or most immigrants are taking British jobs, its important to note that immigrants also create businesses, fill industries with skills shortages (NHS, TFL), replace people who have emigrated and make a positive impact on the economy as a whole. This information gets lost especially when people talk about Eastern-European's filling low skilled jobs that young unemployed Britons could do.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;Yes, I didn't know until DogBotherer told me that ""libertarian"" actually means anarchist.

I would disagree, and so would such respected entities such as the stanford encyclopaedia of philosophy. Anarchists will often claim this title, because anarchists as a bunch tend to really hate libertarians and anarcho-capitalists (generally going so far as to mock the term ancap as being invalid). The thing to remember is that language is defined by mutual majority consensus, and that the current mutual majority consensus is not that libertarian means anarchist, and whether the two used to be interchangeable or not (which they basically were) is irrelevant at this point. It's like saying ""Faggot isn't a slur, it actually means a block of wood"" - well, yes, it used to, but that's not its dominant meaning anymore, and no amount of ""well it used to/should be/could be..."" will change that.

&gt;It is very clear to me that the modern Capitalist ""Libertarians"" are nothing to do with anarchism.

Actually me and Dog (me generally being the more libertarian and Dog generally being the more anarchist) find quite a few areas we agree on, of course we find many we profoundly disagree on also. The two are not different in every way, you could almost say they're applying similar principles with different premises.

&gt;The anarchist philosophy is against private property and entrenched hierarchies and authority. The right wingers worship authority in the shape of corporate power and capital.

That's the thing, anarchists will claim that property rights imply coercion, while libertarians and AnCaps believe that a lack of property rights leads to immorality. I suspect there's no need for me to expand on this because you seem to be relatively well read on the issue but I'm happy to do so, if you want ""the other sides"" perspective :)

&gt;Many modern states exist with little effective defence.

Well, like, 2 or 3 lack a military yes. They're all realistically protected by powerful neighbours though. The primary reason for the state isn't just external security though, there's also internal security (that is, the police).

I would strongly disagree with this, and I think it's a fairly ill-thought out belief system. Yes, of course any state by the fact that it necessitates wealth transfer will have a concentration of power (That's basically the whole point, to have one entity within the state, the government, as the sole legitimate exerciser of physical force) - but that isn't necessarily the richest, in intention or in outcome, and there are numerous examples out there of this.",0,1364948414,null,0,false,0,c97bgir,t3_1bicww,t1_c97bgir,t1_c97b8rb,null,1431693845,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

He reacts quickly and has the pace/stamina to make the most out of threatening counterattack situations, on both sides of the ball. He also finishes well, I will give him that.

However, he struggles when the game slows down. His passing is weak compared to our other midfielders, and, while his vision seems sharp off the ball, I feel he tends to put his head down in possession.

He's a decent defender, better than Lamps (who is a pretty terrible defender) but not really excellent. His defensive positioning is not the best, but he does often make up for it with his pace. His tackling is also often very reckless.

Conclusion from all this? He's a fantastic player to have on the squad, and can be used effectively in a few different roles, but his effectiveness is limited by our style of play.

He was brilliant last year because we played so much counterattack, but our new, possession-based style has forced him to play a role he is not well suited for. He's great to have around because of his flexibility and work ethic, but I don't think he should/will be a member of our first 11 if we continue to play this way (which we will, because Roman says so).

As I dug it, the word ""libertarian"" originally meant anarchist in the leftist sense f it and it was co-opted by the Austrians but it's moot to me anyway. I understand that the modern day meaning refers to Ayn Rand nuts or whatever they are. Rabid capitalists? 

&gt;Actually me and Dog (me generally being the more libertarian and Dog generally being the more anarchist) find quite a few areas we agree on, of course we find many we profoundly disagree on also. The two are not different in every way, you could almost say they're applying similar principles with different premises.

That's nice. 

&gt;That's the thing, anarchists will claim that property rights imply coercion, while libertarians and AnCaps believe that a lack of property rights leads to immorality. I suspect there's no need for me to expand on this because you seem to be relatively well read on the issue but I'm happy to do so, if you want ""the other sides"" perspective :)

Unfortunately I lack DB's skills of reasoned discourse. I know enough about the An-Cap, Ayn Rand, Libertarian etc. school of thought to think it's just a worse interpretation of the psychopathic social system we have now. 

Thanks for offering to elaborate but I have seen enough already. 

&gt;Well, like, 2 or 3 lack a military yes. They're all realistically protected by powerful neighbours though. The primary reason for the state isn't just external security though, there's also internal security (that is, the police).

I don't support the existence of an army. The willingness of people to join the army is a sign of humanity's mental illness. Internal security is also a sham. I think the police exists to protect the government. If there must be a government it ought not need to be protected from the citizens. 

&gt;I would strongly disagree with this,

I don't quite understand what you said. But it seems obvious enough that modern states are part of an evolution from aristocratic rulers to industrial rulers. The main purpose of rulers is to get more stuff for the rulers.

That's not really true, however mostly due to the strong Australian economy rather than any else (i.e. not minimum wage policy). I spent a year in Melbourne during 2010, much of this time employed full time on the relatively low wage of $25 ($20 is about the minimum, depending on region and employment). On this low earning wage I was able to pay my weekly rent with only 4 hours work, frequent restaurants, spend time travelling, make considerable savings (which worked out well given the weak £ and strong $), and generally not have to worry much about money. If I were in a comparable job back here my purchasing power and quality of living would be far diminished. In fact, back in the UK I work more hours now to pay my weekly rent compared to the 'low' earning Australian job, despite earning above the UK median, and despite having a shittier apartment than the one I had in Australia.

This year I was a judge in the eisteddfod (I'm 18 and only the 11-13 year olds in my high school take part, everyone else carries on with lessons). Traditional things are reciting welsh poems, songs, or playing an instument, drawing, and writing a story/poem, all to be judged :) though this year I had to judge 12 Harlem shakes-_-
Basically it's a kids thing to celebrate it, everyone else just carries on, with maybe some welsh cakes thrown in. Wearing red and singing the national anthem is compulsory though :)
The most common song they sing is Sospen Fach (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sosban_Fach)

There's also a competition in primary school for the older kids, where they crown the bard,for the best story, and I remember they made a crown for them too.

Another thing I did as a kid was to go to St Fagans on St Davids day once, where we watched dancing and ate welsh cakes basically, you could check that out, that was pretty family orientated :)

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt; I understand that the modern day meaning refers to Ayn Rand nuts or whatever they are. Rabid capitalists?

Ah not completely. Rand was a nutter and while the US Libertarian party may be quite into her, I consider myself to have a fairly strong libertarian (note, small l = ideology, big L = the US political party) streak running through me, but I think Rand was as nutty as any of the nutters from the far left.

&gt;That's nice.

I think so. I really like Mr. Botherer, he seems like a very decent chap who's sincere and thoughtful, two qualities all too lacking in many people these days. Our politics are, in large parts, quite literally on the opposite sides of the traditional political dichotomy, and yet it's comforting and encouraging that even given that, there are areas where we're in agreement.

&gt;Unfortunately I lack DB's skills of reasoned discourse.

I'm not sure you do, keep reading, keep discussing issues while treating other people like honest, genuine, decent people, and you'll keep doing fine :)

&gt;I know enough about the An-Cap, Ayn Rand, Libertarian etc. school of thought to think it's just a worse interpretation of the psychopathic social system we have now.

I would disagree, feel free to ask questions if you desire to understand more about specific aspects (keeping in mind of course that I'm not exactly a standard traditional libertarian or AnCap) - I would call proper libertarianism highly mutual, with a great respect for life and for freedom and liberty, but a system which requires each individual to be responsible for themselves in ways that many people aren't prepared to be.

&gt;I don't support the existence of an army.

How do you propose a state defends itself from invasion or hostile external action?

&gt;I think the police exists to protect the government.

Never been robbed or burgled, have you? You might view the police as some evil monolithic force, but most of them are decent people like you or I, doing a job, and helping people who've been victims of crime.

&gt;But it seems obvious enough that modern states are part of an evolution from aristocratic rulers to industrial rulers. The main purpose of rulers is to get more stuff for the rulers.

Ok so here's the thing:

People require two things first and foremost from a state, before anything else. They require that it protect them from outside hostile action (invasion, etc.) and they require that it protect them from inside hostile action (murder, burglary, etc.) so we have the military and the police. These are the two minimum requirements for a state. If you have these, you have a state, if you don't have both of these things you do not have a state. The reason being that what makes the state what it is is that it's the one entity which is allowed to use physical force to accomplish things. The rest of us are not, I can't beat you up to get what I want, the state can. That's the point of a state, so that instead of every random villager who wants to nick your shit taking your shit, only the state can.

They do take your shit, in the form of taxation. This is obviously a requirement of them existing because it requires money to oversee the running of an army and police force. So we've got what a state is in its most essential form: it's the body which over a specific area of land has sole right to the use of physical force for the purposes of internal and external defence.

Now, from that essential definition, you can add on pretty much anything you want. Want to add universal healthcare onto the duties of the state? Go ahead. Don't want to? Then don't. They're not necessary functions of the state, just things we like. The nature of a state might be that it concentrates power in the hands of the already rich, but then there are clear examples where that isn't the case.

Look to small nations such as Iceland, or most countries with a population of less than 100,000. Or the Vatican, the guy running that doesn't even get paid (that's a half-joke, obvs.) - there are examples such as Chavez in Venezuala or Castro who lived in a shitty little house for almost all his life as a leader. It might be an occasional or even common feature of nationstates that they concentrate power in the hands of the rich, but it's not a *necessary* feature, it doesn't *have* to be that way. Let me know if that's not making sense.

Now if you want to continue with your idea of getting rid of states I'll pose two problems to you which face both DogBotherers crew and the other lot:

1) Who polices an area of land without a state

and:

2) What d'you do when Tonga decides to invade?

American libertarianism makes perfect sense when the town has common grazing and any second son (who won't inherit the family farm) can head out west and stake a claim to some unused territory - plant it or ranch it or mine it.

Once you take away the right to a roof over your head (or, at least, the right to free land on which to build your log cabin) and to build an independent living (grazing the commons or farming), suddenly ""libertarianism"" isn't the same thing any more.

Ah, there's my problem, I think most people are fuckwits and ignorami. 

&gt;How do you propose a state defends itself from invasion or hostile external action?

I don't. I can't answer the question really. 

&gt;Never been robbed or burgled, have you?

I have been and the police couldn't have prevented it and had no intention of reacting after the fact. Had there been any possibility of catching the perpetrators, I wouldn't cooperate with the police who might lead to imprisonment of the thief. 

&gt;People require two things first and foremost from a state, before anything else. They require that it protect them from outside hostile action (invasion, etc.) and they require that it protect them from inside hostile action (murder, burglary, etc.)

I think this is false. A bit too early in the AM to try for a detailed response. I think that humanity existed without police and a state military force for most of its history. Armies in the past were raised when Sir Schmuckface went to take the stuff of Sir Pissbrain in the next valley. 

I don't see how the police protect me. In third world countries I have visited the role of the police in being lackeys of the powerful is more obvious bt I think the same applies here. 

&gt;That's the point of a state, so that instead of every random villager who wants to nick your shit taking your shit, only the state can.

Maybe the humans will grow up one day and stop allowing this nonsense. 

But the state does not exist to provide defence. ""People"" never required defence and never nominated the state to defend them. I don't with your reasoning and I am too tired to rephrase what I already said - that the modern state is just an evolution of power. 

&gt;Who polices an area of land without a state

Individual communities policed themselves in the past, maybe we can learn from that. Maybe the need for police would diminish in a society where people took responsibility for themselves.  

&gt;What d'you do when Tonga decides to invade?

Offer those bloke a spliff and invite them to stay.

Then there was the ""Mels"" character, who had never been mentioned, and didn't make any notable appearance at their wedding, but she's apparently their best friend. And she was incredibly obnoxious. 

Then there's River. She mistook a banana for a gun. And it wasn't a quick ""grab without looking, and fire"" sort of thing. She *felt around for it* and decided that the round, squishy thing must be a pistol. Moffatt made her unimaginably stupid for a few seconds for the sake of a poor attempt to recreate a gag that was done in an earlier season.

The only reason for the episode to exist at all was to bring in the Teselecta. There was no reason for the whole ""Mels"" retcon, and no reason to be in Nazi Germany.  

TL;DR: Moffat took 45 minutes to say ""Teselecta are shapeshifting robots.""

There *was* two massive problems with our past which I find highly irritating:

Firstly that you get the stereotypical 'rather not work' Brits who could have filled a large proportion of jobs that were filled by mass immigration back in *the good times*.

Mass immigration is only good for skilled Brits (Employers). This is typically where the argument arises because the influx of immigration has had a direct effect on British politics and society whether you like to admit it or not. 

&gt;Immigration isn't the problem, lack of jobs is.

My round up is you cannot disregard *mass* immigration as having no involvement in young unemployment levels, nor can you blame fully those levels on immigration.",0,1364953436,null,0,false,0,c97d9ic,t3_1bjj0s,t1_c97d9ic,t1_c97c4fz,null,1431692995,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Yes, ""government force"" (eyeroll) should be used, for the reason I just stated, it is not a contract which affects only the two sides involved. The world isn't as simple as you'd like it to be.

Meanwhile there's a whole heap of people living in poverty who are no longer getting the essential goods/services they desire and infrastructure is crumbling. The economy is not making the essentials we require today.

If we were to implement a job guarantee to boost spending (you can't just ""gift money"" for fear of the welfare trap it'd create) and find that a large number of people end up just in make-work, then I would agree.

2. Alonso's gonna have a signing bonus, and it's gonna be more than 2 million

3. Your argument assumes that the younger player, in this case Allen, is only being evaluated over a 3 year period; the longer the younger player is at the club, the lower their yearly cost becomes, further widening the gap against Alonso.

4. That comparison at the end is false, because we shouldn't be prioritising midfielders in the first place; we're good there, unless we're picking up someone who can play Lucas' role (which Alonso cannot). Instead, consider what could be done if we put ~8m/year towards a quality CB.

Signing Alonso is us being wasteful with our money - Gerrard's doing his job, and Rodgers isn't showing any signs of wanting to move Gerrard further forward.

2. No one knows for sure except the writers/RTD. He has suggest that she may be the Doctor's mother or someone else important to him.

3. Part of his ""farewell tour"". He couldn't visit Rose as she was in the parallel universe, he wouldn't risk crossing his own time stream to visit her after she had already met him, so he traveled to before he had met her as Nine.

4. Short version, he wanted Jack to hook up with him. Long version:This scene takes place after the end of Season 3 of Torchwood. Basically, he's been through a *whole lot* of shit. 
[Context, BIG Torchwood spoilers](#s "" Jack's on an intergalactic walkabout, trying to get his head together because he's depressed.

To top it all off, he had to sacrifice his own grandchild to save the Earth."")  
Also, Alonzo's had to deal with the events in ""Voyage of the Damned"" although it's unclear how recent those events are to this scene. The Doctor probably picked up he was gay and saw a win-win situation.

5. She was the granddaughter of Nurse Redfield, the woman John Smith had fallen in love with during the events of ""Human Nature/Family of Blood""

I don't think that's the case. I think it has more to do with what Donna said to him in ""The Runaway Bride"". That he shouldn't be alone because he needs someone to hold him back. Strax *definitely* wouldn't tell The Doctor to leave the bad guys alive. And he's had alien Companions before, in the Classic series. [Romana](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Romana) was a Time Lady, [Nyssa](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Nyssa) lived on Traken, and [Adric](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Adric) wasn't even from this universe. [Leela](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Leela) is tricky because she could be considered alien or human.

So I think it's simply a matter of him needing someone to temper him. If it's human, great. If not, great. He hasn't had Companions who look less than human, though, but that's probably because so much of his lives have been spent with humans.

true,confusedpublic,null,null,"Your second paragraph makes a good point. But my counter is that whatever Rodgers and his team are doing is clearly not working. Some of our defensive mistakes can be put down to adapting to a new style of play, but that excuse only goes so far. It doesn't account for Skrtel turning from one of the best defenders in the league to the complete shambles of a defender before he was drop, and for Johnson's complete loss of all defensive ability. It's not just that our defending got worse, the *players* have become worse defenders as well.

A lot of our defensive problems have been due to problems such as positions; Johnson seems to have lost all positional sense when defending crosses coming from the right. Skrtel couldn't figure out how to line up with Agger to stop high balls/knock downs and break aways. I don't have any memory of Enrique being poor at defending crosses, but that's because I can only think of dangerous crosses coming from our left. That means that Johnson might be doing a good job at blocking them from the right, but Enrique is doing a poor job at stoping them from the left. Agger's defensive heading has been pretty poor, never mind Johnson's. The summary of this, is that our defensive positioning over all has been weak. It's no wonder our defence has improved with Carra on the pitch - sorting that out is one of his strong suits.

I'm starting to worry that our situation in defence is similar to what the Football Weekly/The Game pundits think of Arsenal: that the coaching isn't there and good defensive players have either not developed or actually become worse players (they point at Vermaelan in particular for this). So my worry is that, while Rodgers is clearly a decent coach in terms of ball retention, and attacking play, he simply isn't good at defensive coaching and he *needs help*. Obviously a defensive coach would have to compliment Rodgers, and finding the right man isn't going to be easy. I'm not offering up candidates, I'm not that knowledgable. I just perceive what I think to be a weakness in Rodgers and his team's coaching ability.

The above cuts across your proposed solution to our defensive trouble: even if we go out and buy two or three of the best defensive players in the world, they wouldn't fix the problem as a lack of quality coach would result in them either not maintaining their standards, becoming worse, or not pushing on and developing further in the team/league.",0,1364965727,null,0,false,0,c97hmkb,t3_1biy3s,t1_c97hmkb,t1_c97cyk7,null,1431690940,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,Wolfgang_Wolf,,Ceredigion,"I was born and raised in Aberystwyth, in Mid Wales. It is a bit weird as it is a University/tourist town in a traditionally Welsh-speaking area. I went to English medium schools as my family are not Welsh. I'd say almost half the pupils at my primary and secondary schools were English. Also, because of the University, my primary school had a class for non native English or Welsh speakers, so there were kids from all over the world, though the majority of them were from Malaysia. So my experiences are a little different.

In Primary school, probably because of the multicultural nature of the school, they went a bit overboard with the Welshness. This included hours of singing Welsh songs we couldn't understand. St. David's day was no different. There were the traditional costumes, with some of the boys dressed up as farmers. We wore real daffodils, not the fake shit you see nowadays. For the first few years we had an Eisteddfod, complete with mini chair trophies, but that stopped for some reason. One year we had to do a performance of a bit from the Mabinogion. I played an Irish rower, I seem to recall. We had to practice for weeks. 

Also, there was of course the learning about St. David himself. My favourite St. David story of mine is the one where he raises the ground from underneath him in Llandewi Brefi (which is named after him) so a crowd of people could see him make a sermon. Because there aren't any hills in Ceredigion. Apart from the ones everywhere.

Secondary school was a bit different. There was own clothes day, where the idea was to wear a Welsh rugby top. One year I wore my England football shirt. Fuck the system, maaaan. There was also an hour set aside for each year group to be told about how great Wales is. One year, this included watching Tom Jones's performance at the Brit awards.

I'm sorry I don't have any point of reference for it outside of school as it's just a normal day now. For me, it's definitely a kid's thing.",0,1364966020,null,0,false,0,c97hpgv,t3_1bjw1t,t1_c97hpgv,t3_1bjw1t,null,1431690901,3,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,3

I thought he was a good CB, but not as good as the likes of agger, chiellini or thiago silva.. the sad thing is that in football, managers have to be ruthless because a lot of the time(even more in chelsea with torres) they bear the consequences when they keep fielding a player who's out of form.. it boils down to the choice of whether they want to take a risk by continuing to field a player with poor form or axe him, play a more reliable player and potentially save their jobs.. I thought that Carroll had shown enough potential and late form(at the end of the season) to warrant a second chance... however BR chose to be ruthless and sent him off straightway.. Then sturridge came to replace him and he's been a peach so far.. So as much as i'd like to see skrtel come back and win player of the year again, I think selling him now before he gets too old and signing a younger, physically superior defender is more advisable, e.g Ogbonna or Dede.. like i said in my most recent post, I also wouldn't mind the younger Martin given a shot at CB",0,1364967661,null,0,false,0,c97i52n,t3_1bjj02,t1_c97i52n,t3_1bjj02,null,1431690697,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

Which bank? 

Many banks claim to protect businesses money but considering most every bank in the UK was effectively bankrupt just two years ago we can say with confidence that they do not have a great track record. 

Your last point is quite debatable. A healthy monetary and financial system is vital, but does it need a fractional reserve banking system? I would argue no. 

Exactly my point. You have valuable skills and a hell of a lot of people in the world are suffering and dying needlessly. 10,000 + die every day from preventable disease, another 5,000 from lack of access to clean water etc etc. Maybe you could use your skills working in economic development, supporting micro credit solutions in the developing world, developing sustainable economic models at the world bank, working in government to create mechanisms of supporting developing businesses that continue to lack access to credit from the big banks. 

I apologise for my curt words. It's just a shame that some of the most poisonousness industries in the world - oil, insurance, banking, hedge funds, advertising, pharmaceuticals - suck up so much of our best talent with the sole aim of profiting. 

Use your skills for good is all i'm saying. If you are happy that you are doing that then great and good luck to you. Just be aware that the world is a big place and most of the world will never be as lucky as we are and that we should take some personal responsibility and give back.

Clara is some kind of gestalt being created by the TARDIS' consciousness as a means of being closer to the Doctor in a human form. The template for this gestalt Clara is the ""real"" Clara, who died, or will die, at some point within the timeline of this and possibly the next seasons. Somehow, the gestalt form of Clara we see was based off a temporal echo, time's ""memory"" of the real one. The question is, which of these Claras is the real one. 

At this point I feel like my theory's just becoming wild speculation. But this is Doctor Who. There's lots of room for speculation. 

The short form of it: 

Clara meets Doctor. Clara becomes close to Doctor. Clara dies. TARDIS has moment of sentience, creates copy of Clara, sends Clara^2 back in time. Clara^2 becomes involved in wibbly-wobbly time paradox with the goal of guiding the Doctor toward some goal of TARDIS, original Clara, or both.

The idea is to protect defendants from being convicted of an offence based upon their past, rather than the actual evidence. Philpott's previous convictions didn't pass those tests, so that evidence wasn't allowed in - but he was convicted despite that.

When it comes to sentencing, however, the judge very much can (in fact, must) take into account everything from his bad character to his conduct in trial, remorse shown (if any) etc. His conviction for attempted murder will be relevant here, as well as his manipulative character.

If he showed tendencies of psychopathy, that would have been raised at trial (speaking in a legal context, that is).

Perhaps I'm not fully aware, but I thought housing benefit went solely towards rent, and not council tax, and that there are separate things to help with council tax? They specifically only mention council tax from that, and not other bills.

The unemployment, I'd like to see statistics of how many immigrants have left since things have gone wrong, how many jobs are taken by immigrants that could be done by someone British instead. It's easy to blame them, but without the data, there's no way to know - we could still be extremely short on jobs. With no immigrants, perhaps more British would be employed, but I also think it would still be the case that we'd see absurd amounts of people applying for handfuls of jobs.

Part of the problem is our education system, it is just dog shit at encouraging people to study the right things. So many do things like Media studies, and there's yet only small amount, in comparison of jobs available in that area, and so many people studying there are going to be competing against a lot of people. There needs to be better guidance to get people to study for jobs that there are actually more of. Plumbers and Electricians still are going to make a pretty decent amount of money, yet how many are really going into those lines of work?

Even when I was in high school, I studied business and we had a very small class, while there were 3 media studies classes. Then when doing my A-levels, the classes I was in for Maths, Biology and Chemistry were very small, my Art class was over double the size of any of those. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying those things are pointless, but things aren't correctly in proportion, too many are studying things where there aren't going to be enough jobs. How many skilled immigrants do we have where there are skilled British that don't get jobs? That is something I would like to know.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"Just to put it out there - you can't just sign any defensive coach and your defending is magically better. If Rodgers does want to get a defensive coach (and there's no signs he does), that coach has to be in line with Rodgers' style of play. 

Steve Clarke, for example, wouldn't work with Rodgers; Steve Clarke organises defensive units to play a deeper line, and to drop into shape rather than press. It worked with Kenny because Kenny only had very loose tactical instructions. But if Steve Clarke coached those defensive ideas for Rodgers, it would blunt Liverpool's attacking play; we'd go longer periods without the ball, reacquire the ball further from the opposition's goal, and because Rodgers favours possession-based attacking rather than direct passing, we'd take too long to get the ball towards an attacking position. Obviously we counterattack quickly sometimes, but its not our main style of play.

Also, Rodgers' first method of defending is keeping the ball; so the better the whole team gets at keeping the ball, and making better decisions about when to retain possession and when to try and create something, the better our 'defending' becomes, by virtue of simply having less defending to do. Right now, we're still getting there - there's still plenty of times players get impatient and shoot straight at a gaggle of defenders, or cross when there's no reason to. 

Lastly, Rodgers is asking more of his CB's than most other managers ask of their forwards. Rodgers needs his CB's to be mobile, and able to defend and cover much larger areas of the pitch than usual (because the fullbacks are further forward; they, too, have more ground to cover). They also need to be at least capable with the ball at their feet, and whoever comes in needs to be capable of dealing with aerial duels and physical centre-forwards. It's a big ask; playing like Barcelona was never going to be easy, after all. So that's part of the issue - the bar has been set higher, so even if some players played at the same standard as last year, that wouldn't be good enough.

Oh, and we obviously still need to buy defenders, ideally 2 CB's - I don't care who becomes our defensive coach, they're not gonna do well with a back four of Enrique - Agger - Nobody - Johnson.",0,1364975052,null,0,1364975275,0,c97jk1f,t3_1bkp3h,t1_c97jk1f,t3_1bkp3h,null,1431689958,43,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,43

He may be a big character at Swansea, but what happens when he walks into our changing room with World class players, still gonna be as confident ?. 

I think if Carra wasn't playing week in, week out because of his retirement and Skrtel was playing we wouldn't have this inconsistency problem. He was our best player last season and if you think he can't play to the keeper very well, you should see some of Ashley Williams back pases. 

If you think Ashley Williams is better than Skrtel your deluded. Even when he isn't playing well Skrtel is still being linked with Arsenal and Bayern. Yet we want to replace him with a guy that's been in the premiership for two years and pay £12 Million for him when Swansea bought for £400,000 from Stockport County 5 years ago.

May I point out that this is ALSO a lie. As much as I completely agree with the Guardian's agenda here it's important not to act with impunity.

Only 1% of the budget may be lost to fraud, this merely attempts to spin that there aren't large amounts of people simply living off their benefits. The issue with this statistic is that they're living off their benefits completely within the rules of the system while not committing any kind of fraud. Of course you can throw out that 1% statistic and try to spin the issue, it doesn't change the fact there's a large amount of wasters out there.

This isn't to say that there aren't a damn large number of people that need and deserve the system too, it's certainly larger than the number of people just using the system, but that doesn't mean there shouldn't be change in the system to limit the ways these cultural wasters can abuse things and to get them back into work.",0,1364978028,null,0,false,0,c97jyph,t3_1bjj0s,t1_c97jyph,t3_1bjj0s,null,1431689766,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

RE Cancer - flawed logic for two reasons. (1) Having a cure might theoretically shorten treatment overall (and potentially overall profits for treating cancer in the industry), but would be such a popular product for the company that develops it that it would be wildly profitable - so there is still a huge incentive to develop it vs competing pharmas. (2) People that survive cancer (as many are now) are going to live on to develop other conditions that need treatment - so even if the profits from cancer fall, other diseases will take up the slack &amp; then some.

I'm happy to that my parents are working class. But I am aware that the normal use of the label does not describe people in my current situation.

&gt; but hate the class system if it tells you you're middle class?

Indeed I do dislike things that tell me what I should believe.

&gt; And what's wrong with social mobility?

Nothing. Everybody should have the opportunity to be what they want. People who grew up in poverty should be able to be millionaires and prime ministers if they want, without fear of being held back by their background. People who's parents are nobility should be free to be a lorry driver if they want, without fear of social stigma. I don't like the idea that social mobility is about 'moving up', though. We need all professions, from toilet cleaners to CEOs of multinationals, and there shouldn't be such a gap in pay and respect between 'top' and 'bottom'.

Once you have social mobility, the old concepts of class become outdated. The lines become blurred. If you try to keep applying the old model you will give people labels that they don't identify with. I personally identify far more strongly with the working class than the middle class, so I don't like the outdated system that tells me I am now middle class. This study still uses the idea that there are classes (which is perhaps outdated now) but tries to find what classes exist at the current time, given the social mobility of the past. It doesn't try to force me into the middle class, but recognizes that there are people like me, the children of the working class that have moved into less physical professions, but don't feel that the old concept of 'middle class' describes them.

We all moan about the content which the Daily Mail puts out - but frankly the scary thing is it's written by journalists who probably have your average Reddit-esq liberal outlook (no, really - I know some).

But a job's a job - and stories like that sell papers and keep that journalist in a stupendously rare job. Papers are meticulously designed and spun to precisely target their audience segment. As long as 'Vile Product of the welfare state' stories continue to sell 2m copies a day and, along with it, produce the heavy web advertising revenue then they will continue to write them. As disgusting as their content seems there are millions of people out there who lap it up; even if the journalist writing it doesn't believe a word of it. 

Of course, there are the proper nut-jobs like Richard Littlejohn - but he is pretty much one of the audience that they've allowed to submit buckets of bile each day.

And of course - just look at the attention they're getting! Some people here may even have looked through the DM website today - handing them a few more pennies. They don't care if they are seen as vile by us hippy lefties (as they see anyone who wasn't picking off chav immigrants with an air-rifle this morning) because they build a marketable reputation for those who do.

For me, while I preferred 9 and 10, I like 11 well enough too. In his own ways. I don't hate him, or even dislike him. I just like him less is all. 

Then everybody else blames Moffat. Again. Not so simple. He has written some of my favorite episodes. Even though most of those were in the RTD era. So maybe him as show runner as something to do with it. Hard to really say. At any rate. The show just doesn't hit the same cords with me as it used to. 

In a silly way, running away with the Doctor was this great thing to dream about. I felt like 9 and 10 were protectors. (I haven't watched enough classic Who yet to really comment on that) Like somehow, it seemed safe. Even when it wasn't. I don't get that ""take my hand and just trust me"" vibe with 11. 

I'm most interested in the 50th Anniversary episode and I'm hoping against all hope that the way Rose and 10 tie into it is awesome. Maybe it will bring back a little of what I enjoyed in the past.

A lot of hate is directed at students and graduates these days but you can't really begrudge doe-eyed youngsters from persuing the career of their dreams (even if that is fashion and media). If, as is clearly the case, we are producing too few engineers and too many media graduates then there should be financial incentives and penalities to encourage students to study those subjects that are beneficial to the economy. If universities want to pay to run courses that are of ""cultural benefit"" but offer little to the economy (like say Latin/classics) then let them do it with their own cash.

It seems to me that students contribute to their education hugely through fees now. The government subsidises the universities and contributes in that way... the third party that really needs to contribute more is buisness. Which ironically is the biggest beneficiary of an educated population. Seems that every other day Dyson or Branson are bemoaning a lack of skilled graduates in the papers... why not put your money where your mouth is to encourage students into those areas?

true,Evis03,cnty-uk,Welshman-on-Mersey,"I spent 2 years in uni and run up large debts before realizing I didn't want to go. The assumption throughout the education system from start to finish is that you will go to uni. Alternative options are only briefly touched on, and everything is phrased in terms of university ""You'll need this to get into university, this will help you in university, that attitude won't work in university, when you're in university..."" and so on.

There certainly needs to be a cultural shift away from the idea that a university education is the only form of further education worth having. But it needs to be in schools and the home as well- my family were just as pushing for it as my teachers were.

People should certainly be encouraged to work to their maximum potential, but more important than that is to consider how their potential and hopes would be best realized- as opposed to simply assuming a degree is the universal solution.

And this one may be a little controversial, but I think one of the best courses of action would be for university to be attended somewhat later in life. Not much later, but after a couple of years of experience. Let's say for example you want to be an engineer or similar. Work your A levels around that and get a low level position in the field. There are usually some sort of positions available for people with decent A levels even if it's not exactly what you want to do. That work gives you context, helps you learn to function in the 'real world' and lets you build up some capital for your education. And if you find it isn't what you wanted, at least you've got the opportunity to switch tracks before running up huge debts and spending 3+ years of your life. 

Having worked in the field you now have a much clearer idea of if it's something you really want to pursue, and if you do you have a much better practical grounding on which to base your education. If you're good at your job and your employer sees potential, they may even help cover the cost of your university course in exchange for X many years no competition clause, something I believe already happens.

Just a thought.

So you have to become skilled. Staying away from Uni isn't necessarily the best option. Although if you go through an apprenticeship and such like then you on a cheaper path to becoming skilled. Perhaps what this article should say, is just any old degree will not do. Worst case scenario, many other countries require a Bachelors as part of their work or residence visa.

My personal highlight of this article were these paragraphs:


&gt; The answer is not more top-down planning of the sort that gave us our higher education crisis, with politicians choosing sectors they guess will create the “right” sort of jobs, but a broad policy to encourage global firms to base their best-paid positions in the UK, and to trade and export from our shores.


Less top down planning and more airy-fairy arm waving describing the results rather than the method is what we need!


&gt;That means low tax rates and living costs, a better business climate and enhanced infrastructure and airport links; sadly, we are faring miserably in all areas.


Lower taxes and more infrastructure! Because *that's* how taxes work!

My best recommendation would be to setup an estate agency / property management business and get s ""buy to let"" mortgage for the business to buy the property you're currently in, the deposit necessary will only be circa 20% which will leave you enough deposit for the next flat and some slack money. Take another 20% for your new home which will also be ""buy to let"" but you will be letting the new flat.

Here's the best bit, both mortgage interest rates and costs can be deducted from any profits you may make from letting the properties. Ideally, you don't want to make too much profit because that will be taxable and you will lose profit. What you want to do is maintain high expenses; repairs, mortgage repayments, maintenance, improvements.

Any further profit should be put forward by the business into the staff pensions which is non taxable.

This is your best move IMHO and is my strategy as in in a similar position

The classic series was different, but still amazing. For instance, episodes were longer (4 to 6 25 minuet parts usually) but that just made for more fleshed-out stories. Basically, if you're skipping such a great part of Doctor Who's history then you're missing a key component of the series.

So I would suggest going to Dailymotion and starting watching 'An Unearthly Child' part 1. Keep in mind that you should wipe your mind of everything that you know.

It was very common to study things like history, geography, media, fashion etc. back then - and very few students had a job planned. Most found a job in the gap between final exams in May and graduation in August. 

These days though, student numbers in subjects like biotechnology, maths, engineering have gone through the roof. Media is popular - but deceptively much of this is from overseas students... a cynical part of me thinks this is probably because for a decade or so it was seen as a back-door way of settling in the UK. But by all means, if foreign students want to pay £9-22K a year to study a worthless degree here, then F-off back home I'm all for it. Good for our economy and bad for theirs. 

Most serious students now have jobs or work placements arranged as early as their 2nd year of study, and at least some sort of idea which part of industry they want to go into.

So even newly qualified teachers are [in the upper 50% of the population in terms of income](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_in_the_United_Kingdom#Percentile_points_for_income_of_individuals_before_tax), and those at the top rate of the main scale are only just outside the top 25%.

* True manufacturing companies that produce physical goods (think JCB, BAE Systems, Dyson etc.) now commonly outsource parts of their buisness to other companies. E.g. their cleaning, accounting, warehouse management etc. In theory those companies are not 'manufacturing' companies... but in reality, 15 years ago those were in-house departments that would have been counted as 'manufacturing jobs'.

Teachers are supposed to have 10% non-contact time written onto their timetables. Many rules that have been put in place are being ignored by schools such as guaranteed non-contact time, and the provision that teachers will 'rarely cover' teachers if absences are known about by the school in advance. Add this to the fact that school budgets are shrinking and schools aren't always replacing staff, leading to most teachers being on maximum timetables allowed. Having experienced this for the last 3 years or so, it's no way to live, holidays or no holidays. 

I presume that this seemingly excessive demand is due to Michael Gove's refusal to dialogue with Unions at this time. He is also threatening to get rid of the directed time provision (the number of hours teachers are expected to be in schools and also the long holidays.) Add to this the removal of the pay scale and the continual erosion of [pensions,](http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6067510) and the introduction of performance related pay at the whim of the headteacher, and teaching is really no longer a desirable profession to get into.

&gt; The Department for Education said reforms brought in by education secretary Michael Gove would reduce the burden on teachers.

This is complete BS. New GCSEs and A levels to be introduced, which we currently have very little information about. I also presume that this is a tactical headline grabber on the part of the NUT to stir debate and to begin as a negotiation point. If Michael Gove continues to devalue the teaching profession I think there will be far fewer teaching recruits and teachers leaving the profession in large numbers.

&gt; The Treasury accepts that the contribution increase is designed to help reduce the deficit, rather than improve the longterm viability of the pensions system. It has said it will raise £2.8bn from the policy. The money will not go directly into reducing the future costs of public sector pensions, but paying down the deficit. In that sense this is a political decision to make public sector pensions contribute more in this way to the deficit reduction programme.

The strikers felt as though they had achieved nothing.

I think about it quite often, I like to watch the English, I suppose. One of the things I find most interesting is that it is not so much a ladder as one might assume; that is, it is not true that everybody is trying to move up, as they might do with wealth.

When it comes to money, people will often desire to move up a bracket, be richer than they are, and so an outsider to the English class system might assume that the same is true of class, and everyone wants to move up a class, but it's generally not true at all. The people in some working class pub won't all be attempting to come across middle class, trying to throw dinner parties and go to museums, they will most probably think that sort of thing a little silly, and have instead real pride in their working class status, as if they are the 'real people', salt of the earth, and others are just arsing around. And often middle class people will talk of the upper classes as if they are just idiots, over educated, over wealthy, out of touch, and that the 'real' people are the middle classes. I suppose that is English culture; class is a weirdly morphed pyramid where every group feels they can look down on every other.

The supposed superiority of one's own group by the members of that group encourages a self-imposed distancing from the other classes, and as every class in some way wants to back away from every other, or at least wants to think about things in terms of 'us and them', this tension keeps the entire structure very rigid and solid.

What I mean to say is that, when talking about class and not money, there is often no desire for movement at all; a working class guy who finds himself stuffed into a dinner jacket at a riverside soiree is likely to feel just as out-of-place and uncomfortable as an upper class guy who has been stuffed into a knees-up in a flat-roofed working class pub. And it is in that *discomfort*, that *feeling out-of-place*, that class still flows strongly through this society.

My BSc had about 35 hours of contact per week, and maybe another ~10 hours outside of that working at home. It wouldn't have been possible to do it in any less time or part time (at least without stretching it over 6 years).

However, for BA degrees like economics that tend to have more like 10-15 contact hours per week I entirely agree. And indeed, I expect many students on those degrees work part time (and probably a decent amount of hours). So although they are ""full time"" students its probably more like 50:50 work/uni. Obviously a few kids come from wealthy backgrounds and university is just a 3 year exercise in work avoidance - but thats a seperate issue.

A lot of the problem is, even for degrees with few contact hours - most university scheduling requires you be available from 9-6pm monday - friday. Few degrees give you a comittment that you will only ever be in monday-wedsnesday to allow you to take on a proper 2 day a week part time job.",0,1364985727,null,0,false,0,c97ktvm,t3_1bkrz6,t1_c97ktvm,t1_c97ksj8,null,1431689358,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

&gt; you could probably lump these people into lower, middle and upper classes

Probably, but would it be a good description? I'm not sure which I should be put into as a scientist. I have to spend a decade or so at a salary of 25-35k on short term contracts. So I am constantly moving, which makes it hard to invest in property (why buy a house for 2 years?). It also makes it hard for my wife to find work, so my admittedly not bad 25-35k is the sole income for the household. I also have very little job security, with no guarantee that another job will be there when this one finishes.

So am I middle class, because I have a PhD and a decent salary? Or am I working class, because I have to travel around begging for work wherever I can, never sure where I'll be working in a year or two, having to give my money away in rent rather than invest it in putting down roots?

When I was at university, I wouldn't have even called most of the people on reasonably tough courses ""educated"", they were just very good at a very specific thing. Many could do some cool maths, but had never read a book or picked up a newspaper. There's nothing particularly wrong about that, but I don't think it benefits society in any ""indirect"" ways as you imply.

So when even those on traditionally hard courses aren't particularly ""educated"", what about the people on the supposedly shit courses? 

Do we really think people graduating from sub-standard ex-polys in ""Media Studies"" or ""Business"" are particularly educated or enlightened? What positive externalities come from those courses?

Many, many students these days at a lot of our universities are spending most of their time getting battered and doing as little work as possible to get that shiny sheet of paper at the end of their course. They couldn't give a fuck about being ""educated"" or anything like that, they just want to live the university life and get a job at the end of it.

Obviously, I can't speak for all students and there are plenty of smart people coming out of university, but I really don't think that a higher number of students graduating from universities means our society is more educated, not even close.

I'm normally quite defensive of students, but if there's one thing being at university taught me, it's that the majority of students don't have a clue about anything other than what they're being taught, which is generally a very narrow area of knowledge.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"No amount of feet stamping will create the extra money needed to avoid the ""cuts"".  In fact, we don't really have the money to pay for what we're already spending.

I use quotes around ""cuts"" because the government is spending more than it ever has.  The ""cuts"" are reductions in expected increases.

That being said -- I entirely appreciate that there is pain going on.  Overall spending increases can absolutely still equal decreases in some departments -- local government seem to have taken the brunt, while international development was ring-fenced.  That doesn't change the fact that in order to change the direction of movement away from the cliff edge, something has to give.  Striking won't change that.

It's a free country, and they are of course entirely entitled to strike.  What good will it do?  Also: they should consider how it looks to the millions of private sector workers who have had wage cuts (not just below-inflation increases), worsened conditions and crappy outlook for five years, and only see strikes as public sector demands that they pay for them not to suffer as much as the private sector.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"I do something similar. I have four fullsize billy bookcases. I mostly read eBooks these days, or mass market paperbacks [the two for £7 that Tesco / Asda deep discount]. If a book is OK / Good, it'll remain on the Kindle. If the paperback is the same, it either gets passed onto friends, or put into a pile, ready to be donated to one of the local charity shops.

If a book is great it gets to live on a bookcase. My theory is that over the course of however many decades, the bookcases will represent everything that I've adored, been challenged by, inspired by etc. etc. from the world of literature.

For me Michael Connelly, William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, Michael Chabon, Margaret Atwood etc. etc. are the authors whose works I buy the day they're released.

I've read a few Banks / M. Banks novels, but they've never quite captured my imagination. I know, however, that this is a failing on my part as a reader, as opposed to a failing on his part as an author.

About an hour before the news broke, I received an email from the library telling me I'd got a reservation waiting. The book? *Transition*. I was going to pick it up next week - I think I'll grab it Friday evening / Saturday morning instead, and read it this weekend.

That said, I think they could tweak set piece defending. It was probably too much for Agger (he adapted the best), Carra, Skrtel and Lucas to adapt all areas of play: defending, change of possession, out of possession and set pieces. 

Rodgers probably already knows this, he is likely giving it until the end of this season to get the players to adapt further. If he was really going to make a shot at 4th spot in January he could have tweaked the line and set piece defending with man-marking, more players behind the ball etc. That would have involved conceding that part of his style of play just didn't work with the current squad.

What is most likely going to happen is Rodgers will fill out the team with the players to suit his style. That doesn't mean Skrtel is leaving, but it does mean that he is a squad CB who needs to wait out his form slump and get adapted to the new style.

IMO there are probably only 7 or 8 players in the squad that naturally fit Rodgers' play style. We did, afterall, go through 8 transfer windows purchasing players who are more direct, physical, with pace etc. Takes more than a season to undo all of that.

IIRC we still have the worst, or close to the worst, set piece defending stats in the league. Rodgers took the long view rather than plug short-term fixes, which I think he needs to be commended for (some managers adapt styles around squads, while others impose their style and build squads - Rodgers is the later, which is what the club wanted).

could it be that the implication is that youth unemployment predated ""education education education"", the difference being that now the underemployed youth now have debt around their necks.

in terms of radical action, i think that ""cuts"" et al, are only so effective when you have something to counteract them. As much as I can to an extent agree with the sentiment that the current state heavy structure inherited from Labour needs radical re balancing, we need something more than Tesco or coats jobs to fill the gap.

I previously did a bit of consultation work for an Australian carbon brokerage and one thing i found out was that in countries like India and China, while they consume masses of fossil fuels, they are also the worlds leader in green investment. 

These countries do not have as a binary, zero sum view on energy as we do. They need as much energy as possible, environmentally friendly or not, and even if it is not as productive as coal or gas, **it is a good idea** because it created jobs, in the long term was self sufficient and had the added bonus of being good for the environment.

When the coalition started, I liked the idea of a green bank that was mentioned. I am far removed from being any sort of expert, but in terms of traditional industry we are dead in terms of global competitiveness, so for the life of me, I cannot see any other areas where new skilled industrial prospects could come from.

It seems to be good enough for the Indians, Chinese, Australians and Germans who I believe are aiming at full sustainable energy for its transport industry by 2020. ",0,1364991412,null,0,false,0,c97ln86,t3_1bkrz6,t1_c97ln86,t3_1bkrz6,null,1431688974,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

They are. But I find it helps if you pretend they're not sometimes.

&gt;I don't. I can't answer the question really.

That's a problem for your argument. A big problem. It's like saying you're proposing a new better kind of car but you can't explain how the wheels are going to fit on.

&gt;I think this is false. A bit too early in the AM to try for a detailed response. I think that humanity existed without police and a state military force for most of its history.

Look at that history, is that what you want? The strong doing as they please with the weak, accusations of theft responded to with mob justice? You seem to be advocating for a step back here bud, if I'm honest.

&gt;Maybe the humans will grow up one day and stop allowing this nonsense.

Don't wait....

&gt;But the state does not exist to provide defence. ""People"" never required defence and never nominated the state to defend them.

Well, there are lots of arguments here. Some would agree, others would say that the state defends by consent - however to reiterate, one of the necessary functions of state is that it does provide defence, because the necessary origin of state is that the authority to use physical force must be restricted to one body in order to prevent violent anarchy (the mad max kind).

&gt;Individual communities policed themselves in the past, maybe we can learn from that

Generally very badly, with much injustice, score settling, mob justice, and so forth. What do you wish to learn from this?

&gt;Maybe the need for police would diminish in a society where people took responsibility for themselves.

There will always be leeches mate, can't get rid of that.

The cultural one is obviously extremely limited and changes a lot, I could click all of them if I was stationed in London then a few months later none of them because I was on tour in Afghanistan.

I get irked with statements like that, it's like when people say ""We need more women in the IT industry, we need to make it more appealing to women""

Why? I'm not in this industry because it appeals to me as a male, so why should we have to change things to ""appeal"" more?


I don't see evidence that there is an ""anti-black"" choice being made..

&gt;""When I first told my dad I wanted to be a singer, he said, 'What makes you think you're going to succeed? Black people from this country don't succeed.""

If we have a shortage of unskilled workers that should be a sign of progress, but we shouldn't shoehorn people perhaps even destroying betterment through austerity measures to create a new expanded working class. I think I summed up my point as follows: jobs should fit people rather than people fitting jobs, if we all must be bagged and tagged as discreet economic units. It's perhaps time to move beyond the corporate definition of what is allowed to be legitimate and remunerated economic activity.

An interesting quote on education from the eugenic movement:

&gt; [In another and quite different way, compulsory education is of service to eugenics. The educational system should be a sieve, through which all the children of the country are passed,—or more accurately, a series of sieves, which will enable the teacher to determine just how far it is profitable to educate each child so that he may lead a life of the greatest possible usefulness to the state and happiness to himself. Obviously such a function would be inadequately discharged, if the sieve failed to get all the available material; and compulsory education makes it certain that none will be omitted.](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19560/19560-h/19560-h.htm#Page_371)",0,1364993868,null,0,false,0,c97m5c7,t3_1bkrz6,t1_c97m5c7,t1_c97m0e7,null,1431688737,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Not the right analogy. In order to answer the question I would have to spend all day deconstructing what I think. Too much like hard work. I think that while it's pragmatically impossible to imagine humanity improving at all, especially since extinction might be as close as a century away, it is still worthwhile to imagine that evolution of the species is possible. Then again...

&gt;Look at that history, is that what you want? The strong doing as they please with the weak, accusations of theft responded to with mob justice? You seem to be advocating for a step back here bud, if I'm honest.


There is plenty of history in which this is not the case. Obviously negative behaviours have greater impacts. Do you not want to try and evolve your mindset towards a more positive intent? 

When I look at history I think that before agriculture, it would appear that human societies were often egalitarian, had healthier social relationships and a sense of mutual responsibility. 

&gt;Well, there are lots of arguments here. Some would agree, others would say that the state defends by consent - however to reiterate, one of the necessary functions of state is that it does provide defence, because the necessary origin of state is that the authority to use physical force must be restricted to one body in order to prevent violent anarchy (the mad max kind).


The idea that the state stands between us and Mad Max distopia is absurd. The state pillages and murders and is a most egregious entity. (Cue Rosling reference, or Pinker???). It's ust that the state isn't doing this thing to YOU right now. 

&gt;Generally very badly, with much injustice, score settling, mob justice, and so forth. What do you wish to learn from this?


I don't think that's true. How do you arrive at this conclusion? I don't think that cultures living away from the interference of a state machine have any worse records on their ability to administer justice. You are just listing some negative stuff and assuming it's worse here than there. Did they tell you that in school or have you done some research? 

The state is not just, it tortures and murders. If you are a member of a group that the state favours you might not know it but many segments of society have very low opinion of the justice meted out by the state. Anyone who's been harassed due to or convicted of a drugs offence knows what the state's justice is like, or anyone tested by ATOS etc. You can just ignore those things though because it suits you and perhaps you're not at present afflicted.

Well, say we have a transfer budget of £25m (this is just a guess, I have no idea what it will be, could be more, could be less).

Then we sell Carroll for £10-£15m. We'll call it £10m.  Sell Skrtel or Coates for £8m. Sell Spearing (£3m) and probably a few others as well. That would leave us with a total budget of around £45m+

2 quality CB's are likely to cost around £10m each. Now, Im sure there would be enough money left over there to not only sign Alonso, but one or two young players as well.

As for wages, you're right, he might ask for around £90k-£100k a week but if FSG are serious about getting into the top 4 then they are going to have to pay that kind of money to get there. In all honesty someone else of similar quality would probably ask for double what Alonso would because we arent exactly the most attractive proposition right now.

I'm assuming all players are picked at the peak of their Chelsea careers, and that players from previous decades would still compete with modern players. 

Starting XI in a 4-4-2 diamond:

**Goalkeeper:**

Petr Cech - GK

**Defenders:**

Dan Petrescu - RB

John Terry - CB

Micky Droy - CB

Ashley Cole - LB

**Midfield:**

Makelele - DM

Charlie Cooke - RM

Roberto Di Matteo - LM

Rudd Guillit- AM

**Forwards:**

Didier Drogba - ST

Peter Osgood - ST

**Subs:**

Peter Bonetti - GK

Dennis Wise - MF

Frank Lampard - MF

Ron Harris - DF

Gianfranco Zola - ST


Went for a lot of classic Chelsea players over some of the newer players as I figured the newer players would get picked in lots of other people's teams. The thought of Osgood and Drogba linking up makes me very happy indeed. I'm aware that in a few positions there are some better options, but this slowly turned from a best Chelsea team, to my favorite Chelsea team. I'm doing this at work, so if I've made a ridiculous error while I'm rushing this out, tell me!

EDIT: I wonder if its possible to recreate some of the old players on FIFA using the Be a Pro thing, have them all play for Chelsea, and make a team like this...

In fact, in that context, secondary school has far more positive externalities than university as it provides a wider range of education.

What uni did you go to though?

I did two degrees at a... shall we say, second rate institution and now I'm at a world class one. The second rate institution was full of people doing mediocre work for mediocre degrees to go and work mediocre jobs at coffee shops and service industries. They were good at playing the university game, but not generally knowledgeable people. 

By contrast at the world class institution you have people interested for learning for educations sake, with broad areas of knowledge and a greater understanding.

Then again, of the plenty of people who I know who went to universities (excellent, decent or otherwise) precisely none of them have ended up on the street or as criminals. The same cannot be said for the people who left school at 16. 

&gt;Many, many students these days at a lot of our universities are spending most of their time getting battered and doing as little work as possible to get that shiny sheet of paper at the end of their course. They couldn't give a fuck about being ""educated"" or anything like that, they just want to live the university life and get a job at the end of it.

I am expecting to graduate with a first class MPhys from a Russell Group uni, but the only job offer I have is £22k as a junior software dev, to be fair it's in the South and outside of London (which I like - and the office seemed really friendly) so I'll probably take it anyway but it pales in comparison to the salaries promised by pushy Sixth Forms etc. but then I'm new to the working world so perhaps expecting more is just greedy.

It seemed that most software companies greatly preferred CS Students though, and it was kind of unnerving when applying that not only were there CS students with more relevant experience, but also older people :/ I guess the downsides of a recession.

I'd prefer to work in tech, but when I looked at finance work they required internships, often unpaid - and I spent my University summers working in European labs (largely because they were one of the few paid placements and I was fortunate enough to win the scholarships to work at them).

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;There is plenty of history in which this is not the case. Obviously negative behaviours have greater impacts. Do you not want to try and evolve your mindset towards a more positive intent?

What do you mean ""evolve my mindset""? We live in a world where murder and rape and theft and all sorts of other things are common in most of it, and only held away by a thin veneer of society in the good parts of the world.

People vastly over-estimate how far we've come since we were wearing animal skins and beating each other over the head with sticks.

&gt;When I look at history I think that before agriculture, it would appear that human societies were often egalitarian, had healthier social relationships and a sense of mutual responsibility.

War between tribes was far more common, life was militaristic, if you're hungry and you see a man with food you kill him and take his food. Is that what you want again?

&gt;The idea that the state stands between us and Mad Max distopia is absurd.

So I can beat you up, and you can beat me up, and both are valid. Or a third person can beat both of us up and make us do what they want. Whats to stop them without an ultimate authority? The goodness of their hearts? You can rely on that if you please, I'd prefer to have laws.

&gt;The state pillages and murders and is a most egregious entity.

You claim this happens by the hand of the one body which has the lawful right to use force, what do you predict if every body and every person has the right to that force?

&gt;I don't think that's true. How do you arrive at this conclusion?

History.

&gt;You are just listing some negative stuff and assuming it's worse here than there. Did they tell you that in school or have you done some research?

I read history as a pastime, justice was brutal, often based on hearsay, not what I desire at least.

&gt;The state is not just, it tortures and murders.

Look, you're claiming this, but you need to start thinking philosophically here! Is it a *necessary* feature of the state that it torture, murder? No. It is not. That is not an essential part of what a state is, and while some do these things, others do not. Therefore that is not an argument against the concept of statism, but an argument against specific applications.

&gt;You can just ignore those things though because it suits you and perhaps you're not at present afflicted.

No, I don't pass over those things because I'm not affected, I pass over those things because they're not really relevant to the discussion.

Off all the theories I've heard so far, I'd say this one most fits with the types of things that Moffat would try to pull. However, there are a few problems with this as it stands.

1. While Clara had been uploaded to the bank where minds were stored, the entire bank was dumped. Why save her imprint? Was only her imprint saved? For that matter, was there even a base station anywhere near where her body was located? 

2. What evidence do we have that the Great Intelligence can manipulate time? Both Bad Wolf and Dalek Ca'an involved interaction with the Time Vortex. Dalek Ca'an couldn't manipulate past or future events beyond knowing ALL of time and being able to manipulate events based on that. Nothing we've seen so far on the part of the Great Intelligence indicates that this is a likely scenario. The Great Intelligence has had to use humans in both cases.

3. If the Great Intelligence seeded Clara through space time, we'd expect to run into her multiple times as the story-line progresses. He has apparently found her, or a manifestation of her. Is that the end of the search? Or does he move on searching because this Clara doesn't want to go traveling with him?

To really dig into the mystery that is Clara, a question needs to be answered. Who gave her the phone number to call The Doctor? The Doctor didn't find her. Someone else found her and notified The Doctor. We do know it was a woman.

Here's what I found: playing next to a ""destroyer"" DM for Liverpool, Alonso had some of his worst defensive stats (0.017 interceptions per minute). 

Gerrard this season is playing the deep position that Alonso occupies. 

Gerrard has 31 starts with almost 2800 minutes played [link](http://www.liverpoolfc.com/team/player-stats/11618/Gerrard), but has significantly less defensive stats than Alonso although their passing stats are similar. Alonso had 24 starts with 2200 minutes played, but has 40 more interceptions, 170 more duels, and 30 more tackles. All that in 7 less starts and 600 less minutes. In fact, those defensive stats are similar to a decent center half. Vertonghen this season has 80 interceptions and 62 tackles from 2400 minutes.

Even more interesting, is Alonso's 0.79 passes per minute to Gerrard's 0.73.

So yeah, Alonso wasn't REALLY a DM at Liverpool when playing off Lucas or Mascherano. I fucked up there, I'll admit it. But his stats at Madrid since he left are impressive. However, Mourinho is being criticized now for relying on Alonso as the sole DM, and how it is tiring Alonso out. Playing without a destroyer DM, all of Alonso's stats have dropped considerably. Playing next to one, all his stats are incredible.

true,[deleted],null,null,"As far as academic quality goes, it really depends on what you're doing. Some departments are far better than others. What are you studying? 

I'd like to work, but it's very difficult to find a job. I've been applying since September and I have only had one interview.  If you're interested in working, I'd try to apply early, before the wave of returning students start applying too. 

This year I lived in the dorms, as I didn't have much time for finding private housing, and it was just easier. It's actually not bad, I live on a floor with the third years who are all 21-23, and they're not super rowdy or loud. Next year I'll be in private housing, but I'm sure I'm going to miss the unlimited heat and hot water in the dorms. It can get freezing here, and the heating in student houses can be really bad!

If you're looking to find a room, the student union has rooms that they rent, you can find them listed on the [accommodation website](http://www.swanseastudentpad.co.uk/Home). Often they're better than private landlords, they will be quick with repairs and keeping a adequate standard. 

As far as downtime goes, I like to go out on the beach and walk there, it's really beautiful.  I'm from Minneapolis and I'd never seen the ocean before, so it was a big perk for me when I came here. The area around Swansea is gorgeous, and there are some really nice beaches.  One of them, Rhossili (spelling is wrong I'm sure) is supposed to be one of the best in Europe.

I go out to pubs and such with my friends; there's nice ones and it's fun to feel British. I do things with some societies too, so that's a lot of my time there. I go out clubbing from time to time, you'll definitely hear about Sins on a Thursday night. It's the big night out for students.  Wind Street is a street full of bars and clubs that cater to students on Wednesdays, so that's also a big event. 

What are you interested in? There's not tons and tons to do in Swansea, but there's enough to keep you interested!

One thing of advice, SAVE NOW! It's expensive, even with student prices, so try and build up some savings before you come over.

There's nothing unusual or sinister about this. It's part of the principle that everyone should have a fair trial, which is a cornerstone of the British legal system.

true,BritOli,null,null,"For all the recent stuff that has happened, the UK banking sector throughout history has a great track record. Many UK banks have operated for hundreds of years successfully. Remember, the majority of the ""toxic lending"" that started the liquidity crisis actually took place in the States. Investment banks brought those loans over to the UK due to the failure of credit rating agencies and financial models (I don't know how much you know about this stuff). When those investment banks took a hit, the government bailed them out in order to protect the retail, business and corporate banking arms. A collapse of these would have made the whole situation a lot worse. 

But there is a difference between then and now. What we now have via Basel 3  is that by 2019 there will be a substantial increase in the buffers that banks must hold against a variety of different shocks. Furthermore the ring-fencing of investment banks should stop taxpayers ever having to bail out these banks. They can now go bankrupt peacefully if they make mistakes. 

So I would say that banking has a rich history, particularly in this country, and that the regulations being brought in should stop something similar happening again. The area where I still think there needs to be greater reform/distrust is in the area of credit rating agencies (Fitch, etc), but a lot of work has been done to improve upon the previous model.

I think FRB is vital. I'll copy from a previous post of mine:

&gt;Fractional Reserve Banking means that when you give your bank £100 to deposit, it only has to keep £10 in the bank, and it can lend out the other £90 to profitable ventures. Now imagine there are millions of people all doing this. Fractional reserve banking works as long as all those people don't all withdraw their money at the same time. That's known as a bank run. Deposit insurance is a way to mitigate against bank runs.
Fractional reserve banking is often slated by conspiracy theorists although I imagine there are some people who dislike it for more rational reasons. It is being described as ""fraud"" due to the inherent instability that comes with it.
However the truth is that allowing a bank to lend out money that otherwise would sit dormant allows for a host of brilliant new ventures to be pursued. Consider a world in which banks simply held onto money in vaults and were not able to lend any of it out. All your savings would sit in a room doing nothing, earning no interest. Fractional Reserve Banking ""frees up"" currency to help drive new ideas and new businesses. Without FRB there is less credit. With a drought of credit you end up with a permanent ""credit crunch"" and a world in which the standard of living rises much slower. I cannot stress enough how important this is. Although the system may seem flawed, the benefits it provides are huge. The economy is the most important deciding factor in most elections - people care about it immensely. So I urge you not to be dismissive of a system that aids economic growth and invention. Most people are willing to accept the tiny degree of instability inherent in FRB for the huge benefits that the system gives. And as I hinted at earlier, there are some ways to mitigate the inherent risks slightly (although it's kind of like a game of whack-a-mole - another problem always pops up).

&gt;The system allows the ""working class"", who are credit-constrained (don't have large savings), to borrow in order to fund their new ideas. Without credit they must a slave to a boss. FRB empowers the working class by widening the availability of credit allowing employees to become employers.

&gt;Customers are free to learn how FRB works. Most people do know that their money is lent out again. Most people have heard of bank runs. Most people know to a greater or lesser degree that Banks don't hold just cash. Most people know that banks can go bust. All of this information is available to the customer, and one need only a GCSE or A-Level in Economics to hear about FRB. Bank deposits are very safe and the average Joe need not concern himself with worrying about such a small risk. THERE IS NO DECEPTION HERE. DECEPTION IS NECESSARY FOR A FRAUD. One must remember that FRB does not go unchecked - Central Banks, Regulatory Bodies and Governments are guardians of the average Joe's bank account. It is in everyone's interests to ensure that the system which enhances credit continues. One Bank failure is all it takes to make depositors never wish to deposit in any bank ever again - for a whole generation. So governments insure deposits, and act as an additional regulator to personal investigation. It is in the governments interests to protect deposits

&gt;There is a choice to stuff your money under a mattress. I imagine that there is also a bank that will hold onto your money for a fee, without lending it out. Perhaps? If not, maybe you should create one. There is a choice here. You don't have to hold your money in a bank account. With inflation eroding the real value of a persons money, those that do not deposit their money in an interest saving account face a significant cost - which dramatically over exaggerates the riskiness of a complete financial meltdown. It is simply smarter to take the small risk of a bank failure.

I'm probably not going to convince you, but it is my opinion that FRB is a perfectly justifiable system and to my credit I have given it considerable personal thought and reflection and read into both sides of the argument.

Regarding ""doing good"", as I have said, working in the bank will allow me to indirectly support job creation and rising prosperity. I am tempted to quote Adam Smith here ""It is not by the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner, but by their regard for their own self interest"". I may not be doing charitable work, but neither are many companies which do brilliant things that people are willing to part with their hard-earned money for. In short, I will be doing good despite working for a business. Moreover, the bank has a significant presence in much of the African continent, where I hope I can use my skills to help aid economic growth. Particularly because, as I see it, aid is not the answer to the problems in many African states, and the emergence of a sustainable, job-creating industrial sector is more likely to result in prosperity. Significant government reform/transparency is often necessary too.

Finally, it is not my intention to continue working at a bank indefinitely. In the short term (5-10 years) working at the bank will allow me to secure myself financially, get a thorough grounding in finance and international business, and pursue professional qualifications. Longer term I will probably make the transition to the public sector / pursue a PhD / join a not-for-profit / start-up my own company. The skills I will learn in the financial services sector will be useful wherever I decide to go and whatever I decide to do.",0,1365000079,null,0,1365000428,0,c97nvqr,t3_1bewbl,t1_c97nvqr,t1_c97im0m,null,1431687920,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Most universities don't have sufficient lab space to cram everything into 3 days... also, some experiments literally take 5+ days, so it wouldn't be practical to be away for two days a week regularly. Similarly, for example, engineering departments have limited resources and teaching space, so can't just ram everybody into a certain schedule.

Many programmes with few contact hours are pretty deceptive - for example the IT/programming student may only have 10 hours contact per week, but in theory they ought to be using the other 30 hours to sit at home coding, reading and studying. The same goes for the English lit. student who should be reading books by the pallet-load.

But look at this from the other side. The old police pensions scheme was that you could retire at 50, after 30 years service, and take a 65% final salary index linked pension. So you have people who work for thirty years, paying in something on the order of 15% contributions, and after that they get 65% back, perhaps for another 30 years (adult life expectancy is not far off 80. I can't see how that's fair to the rest of the workforce, who work until 65 or 68. Ultimately, pensions are a sort of insurance, they're not magic. The only way these sort of pensions can be sustained is if the population is constantly growing (to provide a high working age to retirement ratio) and/or the economy constantly growing at 4-5% in perpetuity.

But it won't apply to the engineer or the biotech scientist. It also won't apply to the nurse, dentist or doctor. Some industries will always require hands on practical skills that are only learnt by watching someone experienced do it - and then repeatedly practising it yourself under supervision.

Likewise, its very easy to learn how a computer works on paper - its another thing to start unscrewing it and take bits out and put bits back in. Easy to do it incorrectly.

With a little experience in the workplace they might've come to that conclusion earlier, and saved themselves a lot of time, money, and effort.

However, from talking to companies recruiting graduates for the area I'm in (electronic/software engineering), and having spent a gap year working, a constant comment is that the level of graduates simply isn't good enough.  The fact that a lot of graduate jobs offer 1-1.5 years training just for a low level graduate position is evidence enough of this.

If people started working in these industries at age 18, I would think that a thorough over-hall of the education system from year 9 onwards would be necessary, as well as requiring people to make their career choices earlier and earlier, something that people wouldn't want to do.

I don't know, but I definitely agree that university isn't for everyone and a lot of people get pressured into it by friends/family/school.

Oswald's second appearance showed that the Great Intelligence was little more than special snow and an poor person trapped with the reflection of his own thoughts until the Doctor mucked up and allowed the dream to become the dreamer.  It is implied that the G.I. only attacked the London Underground in the old adventure because of 11's banter/joke.

By this fourth battle between the Doctor and G.I., from G.I.'s perspective, it is anticipating the Doctor.  It is planning ahead for it and warning his underlings about him.  Creating plans for his inevitable defeat in *this* battle of the war.  In other words, the G.I. has/is doing now what Oswin stated happened to the Daleks.

With Moffat being Moffat, the Silence are likely tied into this somehow.  The Silence worked with the Headless Monks who worship a Papal Mainframe.  Dorium mentions great wi-fi down in his little crypt, which seems odd in light of the last episode.  A museum on the last known world of the Headless Monks had the black box that sent the Doctor/Amy to the Byzantium and River.  

Not to mention the whole disembodied mind and great beings into humans was already done in The Doctor's Wife.  A stand alone episode, or a subtle foreshadowing much like how the Silents' ship appeared in The Lodger revealing its pilots were long dead/gone (~30 years since the Moon landing). 

Now, it is to say the dots are clearly a triangle when you only have three, but the shape could easily be a hendecagon.

Equality of opportunity is exactly what the minimum wage is there to ensure. Some people have the privilege, due perhaps to coming from a wealthy family, to be able to work the bottom rung for less than a livable wage, or indeed, for free. Others don't have that opportunity, and require enough wage to support themselves and perhaps their family. 

Job interviews and application letters are available for all. The privilege of working without sufficient pay is not.

The other way of levelling out that playing field is, of course, social welfare.

No club can pay outright transfer fees these days anyway. 40M pounds is a lot of jack to be in debt, but manageable. 

Not too overly concerned at the moment. I'm more concerned about the prospect of zero European football and how that will dramatically effect our purse strings along with recruitment. One thing we can control is the way we play along with the style of play. If we play some attractive football, like we've been doing the past few matches and hopefully Ian Ayre can sell the club to the right prospective players, then we've got a chance. Hopefully, our concrete interested in Eriksen is true with Luis and Dagger putting in some good words for us.

She said it before and after. When she said it after she was explaining what it meant.


&gt;Off all the theories I've heard so far, I'd say this one most fits with the types of things that Moffat would try to pull. 

Thanks. 

&gt;However, there are a few problems with this as it stands.

&gt;1. While Clara had been uploaded to the bank where minds were stored, the entire bank was dumped. Why save her imprint?

Bait. 

&gt;Was only her imprint saved? 

No idea.

&gt;For that matter, was there even a base station anywhere near where her body was located? 

Of course there was. That's why she was uploaded in the first place. The base stations broadcast the signal and transmit the souls back to The Shard.

&gt;2. What evidence do we have that the Great Intelligence can manipulate time? 

How else would he be able to insert Clara into different Timezones? 


In the Victorian era, Oswin is her middle name. On the Asylum its her preferred name. However, when Clara opened the door to the Doctor and he said, ""Clara Oswin Oswald!"" she said, ""Just Clara Oswald."" She didn't come up with the ""Oswin'' bit until she needed a user name for the Shard. That's when she made it up on the spot.

""Clara Oswald for the win. Oswin!"" 

&gt;Both Bad Wolf and Dalek Ca'an involved interaction with the Time Vortex.

That's not quite what I meant. I was being abstract.

&gt;3. If the Great Intelligence seeded Clara through space time, we'd expect to run into her multiple times as the story-line progresses.

Yep. 

&gt; He has apparently found her, or a manifestation of her. Is that the end of the search? Or does he move on searching because this Clara doesn't want to go traveling with him?

She'll go with him, she's just playing hard to get. You'll notice that she did not take back her book. 

Plus she did have a long day and may want to spend a night thinking things through.

&gt;To really dig into the mystery that is Clara, a question needs to be answered. Who gave her the phone number to call The Doctor?

The only candidate that comes to mind is River. However it could be someone we haven't met yet. We may never know. There are too many variables to answer this question at this time.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"I'd be happy with flat tax.  The same percentage of a big number is bigger than that percentage of a small number. The rich would pay more.  The problem of the non-marginal utility of money is easily addressed with a single tax allowance -- probably set much higher than it is now.

If you plot the curves our ""progressive"" tax system produces to show proportion of income taken as tax, you'll see that the progression shape could easily be emulated to within a few percentage points by careful selection of those two numbers.  Unfortunately, the vast majority like to shout ""UKIP flat taxer"" as if that's an argument, want rich people to feel pain, and haven't even looked at the numbers.

VAT, I will completely agree is one of the most regressive taxes out there.  It's also hugely damaging to business.

&gt; the rich pay less

Utter, utter, nonsense.  As I have already said, the top 1% pay 25% of the tax revenue.  There is no justification at all for saying that the rich pay less tax.  This is like when Warren Buffet was having a big rant a few years ago saying he paid less tax than his secretary -- again, a basic mathematics fail, he might well have arranged his affairs such that he pays a lower percentage than his secretary, but he definitely does not pay less tax.

Your essential problem is that you want rich people to hurt more than they do.  It's not going to happen; what's more, it's not even productive if your goal is more reasonable: to get poor people to be less poor.

Why are no unions striking to lower VAT?  To scrap employers NI?  To increase council tax?  To raise the personal allowance.

Even accounting for inflation, that was a real-terms [50% rise in spending](http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/5326/economics/government-spending/).

Although the deficit never got above ~3% before the crisis, this was on the back of a bubble in asset prices - along with the banks reporting huge profits (and paying tax on those numbers) on investments that have since turned out not to be worth all that. The IMF have since calculated that the structural deficit was [5.2% in 2007](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/9613703/UK-deficit-before-crisis-was-38bn-bigger-than-thought.html). 

The global financial crisis was nothing more than a bubble bursting - and all the tax that we took during that bubble (and more) was spunked on current spending.

I think its a problem that begins at FE level, (obviously discounting the trades - plumbing etc) in that to actually acquire any useful knowledge in a non-academic area you can't just do the academic style lecture-coursework-exam format, you need hands on experience. Unfortunately however, the academic structure is often the only one available, or the BTEC/NVQ/whatever is crap and doesn't include any hand on either

I remember in college most subjects were only available in A-level format, which is just lecture-coursework-exam in order to prepare you to go to Uni and do more or the same, no real useful skills acquired.

This then leads to most 18yrolds still being unemployable and feeling forced to go to university level to get the 'real' teaching. Which again is mostly academic...
