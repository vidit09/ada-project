true,stephendy,eng-dorset,Dorset,"Depends if its preventing us from a proper recovery. One of the things stifling the economy is the lack of consumer spending due to low wages and high cost of living such as energy, food and housing. 

Low public confidence and no job security is also stopping consumer spending and thus causing the economy to contract or not grow as much as it could. I'm now saving rather than spending in case I lose my job due to the very fact that because of the cut backs people aren't spending as much.. It's a catch 22 situation.

The probability that a random citizen of the EU will be able to communicate in English with another random citizen has increased from 29% for all adults, to 48% for young people, from ages 16-25. Scientific literature, English language TV, films and music, the possibility of moving to Britain or America, all have an enormous effect, and the effect becomes more and more self-supporting, because added to those points now, increasingly, you have the ability to communicate with other Europeans.

true,duckman273,1953,Juan Mata,"&gt;We have 4 world-class (IMO) centre-backs, but 2 of them have to sit each game out. 

I actually wouldn't rate any of our centre backs as world class right now, Terry used to be, Ivanovic has lapses, Cahill's consistent, but not brilliant and Luiz could become world class, but as of now he isn't. Plus if we played this formation we would need to buy more centre-backs in order to cover these players, a squad needs depth, which is one of Chelsea's problems this season.

&gt;Moses should be used as a striker because of his size, skill with the ball at his feet, and experience playing there for Wigan (where he terrorized all defences in the league).

Moses is very good, but he's not a striker. His direct runs and dribbling abilities are more suited to a winger and I don't think he can shoot well enough to be an out and out striker.

Nevertheless this formation seems pretty good, but I don't think we should give up on the formation yet. It has Mata playing brilliantly and can work if we get the right players, i.e. more defensive minded, disciplined players in the pivot who can play the ball to our attackers, a decent striker (Ba is good) and an out and out winger who can defend.

A a judeo-supremacist yourself, English is perhaps not your first language so I'll cut you some slack in that regard.

&gt; Zionist leaders also tried to create a country in Congo, Uganda, Argentina or Brazil (don't remeber which one of the two) you may like to read the wiki page on the subject to receive more information.

So Zionism has a long history of wanting to invade territory and install a jewish state by force? What claim is there for the Congo, Uganda or even Argentina? The all certainly lack the spurious notion that ""God gave Jerusalem to the Jews"".

true,Gettingworst,num26,,"Lloris; he comes off his line so quick, he's literally our sweeper. The advantage of his style is that we can afford to push our defence higher up because he can cover the long ball through if the opposition try to ding a ball over the heads of our CBs.

Walker; his defending needs some work, especially this season, his forward play is why he's in the starting line up over Naughton. He brings more width on our right hand side linking up with Lennon with his overlaps and whipping the ball in. 

BAE; same as Walker, but he's too one dimensional with his forward play, while he can give Bale the space to cut inside, his deliveries into the box is a bit sketchy. However, he's a much better defender than Walker. 

Vertonghan; He's comfortable with the ball and is quick. The high defensive line we play suits him because he can recover quickly if a forward slips past him. 

Kaboul; Same as super Jan, but also because he can play in midfield, he can carry the ball out and link up with our midfielders without having to boot the ball up field like Dawson usually do. It helps retain possession and start our attack from the back. A word about Dawson, he's reliable and puts his body on the line with his tackles, his deep cross field ball is dangerous but often ends up going out of play. His lack of pace is a problem when we come up against fast nippy forwards but makes up for it with sheer tenacity.

Parker; He's a much better ""Footballer"" than people give him credit for. We often see him just breaking up play and lay the ball off to other midfields. But it's more because he's disciplined in his given role. He's a destroyer and doesn't do anything fancy. He sees an attack early and break up play, lay the ball off to the other midfield and go cover the space left behind by others. If he has to play more forward, he's more than capable of doing a good job there. 

Dembele; His strength is all about carrying the ball forward through the middle. Some say he'd be better suited with a more advance role, which I agree because space is more of a premium higher up the pitch, he can skip past the densely packed final third of the pitch and give us more options.

Lennon; We all know what he can do when he's on song. With Bale getting all the attention right now and teams line up with stopping Bale in mind, he's getting much more space down the right hand side. The only downside to his game is his reluctance to push forward when he doesn't have the ball. When the play is on the left, he should be tucked in at the far post to give us more bodies up front instead of just staying wide. 

Bale; Well, he's Bale. Everything he touch turns to gold atm. Teams are putting more defenders on him now and the only way he gets to have any action is to roam inside to look for space. When BAE is playing, this isn't a problem because even when Bale cuts inside, BAE is still there to give us the width on the left. When someone like Naughton is playing on the left, because he's not comfortable on his left foot, he lacks the confidence to push forward to join in our attack and we lose our shape down the left hand side. 

Adebayor; He has pace, skillful on the ball, hold play up well and a good eye for goal. BUT, he lacks motivation. He could be a brilliant striker but he's just not interested in most games and it's really frustrating because he could be so much more. You can almost tell what kind of game he's going to have if he can't control a simple ball 10 mins into the game. 

Defoe; for me, he's not the kind of striker that can play alone up front, he needs a target man to help him out as a foil. His goal/shot ratio is terrible for a first choice striker and I always have my doubts about him if we desperately need a goal to save or win a game. As a 30 year old striker, I'm still amazed how he can't hold his line and get himself offside so often. He plays on streaks and when he is hot, he's really hot, when he blows cold, he blows. 

Holtby; Not seen that much of him to judge yet.

Siggurdson; He's just not cutting it atm, everyone keeps saying how we need to start with him, but he's played plenty of games and he hasn't shown any glimpse of the player he was when playing for Swansea. 

Dempsey; he's not as skillful as most of other players in the squad, but he's a workhorse. He runs the line well, keeps our shape and chips in with the odd goal. Every team needs a player like that. He's not a big fish in a small pond anymore and people just dismiss his contribution to the team because he's not scoring as many goals as he did with Fulham, but he does his job well. 

(Edit)
Sandro; similar to Parker but a younger faster version. He's not as good a reader of the game as Parker and reacts to situations rather then anticipate the action, so he gives away a lot more fouls. But he's still young and reading the game will come with age for him. He's also more willing to move forward and swap holding duty with Dembele. Parker is getting on now and is a good cover for Sandro when he gets injured. ",0,1361587103,null,0,1361638305,0,c8k3img,t3_1920nm,t1_c8k3img,t3_1920nm,null,1431379236,15,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,15

We are the super Spurs

Everybody knows we're the football connoisseurs

Seven times we've won the Cup

And number eight is coming up

We're Hot shot Tottenham!

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think that's a complex question... Labour spent more than it earned during the good years. They had no expectation that the global recession would come, so when it did come the economy was not prepared for it. However if there had been no recession labour policies would not have been questioned.

There is no question however that with a labour government in power unemployment would have been lower, and economic activity would be higher. I believe that at this point the debt would be higher, but the deficit would be lower and falling due to economic activity but that can't be proved. The reason I think this is below.

I'm not saying that the Con/Dem policies wouldn't work, short term austerity if properly handled could work very well. However what actually happened is quite confusing. They said a lot about austerity and implemented measures to reduce government spending (Especially welfare and government services), but instead of using that money to reduce the debt they passed measures such as reducing taxes on companies and the wealthy, and expensive system reforms in the name of austerity, which just so happened to coincide with historic conservative policy (e.g. getting expensive companies involved with national services). I was quite surprised with the ""we have shrunk the civil service"" claim. It turned out to mean we've given people across the country who were close to retirement a large redundancy payment, and then rehired them on a higher wage as consultants.

My only explanation for the governments actions is that they thought that it was a global recession, that it would fix itself in due course and that they could use it for their benefit without trying to properly deal with the problems. It was only by the double dip point that their were some hints of investments which might solve the problem.

So was it Labours fault, yes, their infinite growth assumptions were completely flawed. Did the Con/Dem government make it worse, yes, they did not initially tackle the problem but used it to their own political ends. 

In a sense the Con/Dem Government said ""we have to clear up the mess"", but instead spent the cleaning money on a policy party and made more mess in the process.

4) angel is no longer seeing or experiencing anything

5) angel forgets that the silence exist

6) angel has no idea it is being looked at

7) angel activates

8) angel sees silence

A few main factors affect this.  

1)  We know angels can't move when they are being looked at, but on who's terms?  The angels terms?  The universe's terms?  Essentially, does an angel deactivate when it KNOWS it is being looked at, or are they deactivated immediately when they are in an observed situation?

2) is there a duration for each trigger?  Does it take .005 milliseconds to forget about the silence?  Does the angel take a certain amount of time to activate/deactivate?

If the answer to #1 is that it is based on the angels terms + answer to number two is that it takes zero time for each involved event to occur, then the result would be something along the lines of the universe imploding due to an infinite number of events happening at exactly one point in time.

Anything else and it is just a question of who moves faster, a silence at full normal speed or an angel in between forgetting and remembering the silence.

I cried with joy when I finally saw Liverpool win a trophy, the 2001 Worthington Cup against Birmingham, when I was 11.  At age 15, Istanbul literally got me through the summer of 2005 when my world up to that point ended and my parents split up completely out of the blue.

Even if by some horrible trick of fate, Liverpool found themselves freefalling through the divisions and ended up in the BSN, I would support them as much as I did during their Champions League finals.

true,VaqueroGalactico,null,null,"Good analysis. 

My two cents:

BAE at his best is capable of hitting cross-field passes to Lennon or Walker, which is quite useful, especially when teams are shifted to their right to defend against Bale. Often there ends up being a decent amount of space on the right, but Dembele (as good as he is) and Dempsey aren't as good as Modric and Van der Vaart were at switching the play quickly. Also, he's very calm in possession (sometimes way too calm), which is helpful, as this season we've looked a bit tentative when opponents press us.

You make a good point about Parker. When he played at West Ham he chipped in with goals and even took corners and free kicks at times, if I'm not mistaken. He can carry the ball forward, and his tenacity will make things happen, but a creative attacking midfielder he is not.

I like Dembele playing where he is. The number of tackles he's made this season is impressive. He has the energy to play offense and defense all game, and he gets forward well when he does. We need someone to connect our defense and midfield, and it's this job that he's excelled at. If we move him further forward, we'll either be too open, or we'll be depending on someone who is less assured on the ball to get the ball to him in the first place.

One thing I have seen of both Holtby and Dempsey is that both are capable of taking positions out on the left when Bale moves infield. This throws off our opponents' marking, and when we're playing against a packed defense that can make all the difference. 

I think it's still too early to judge Sigurdsson. He's only 23 and he's clearly capable of playing well. I don't think he should be starting over Holtby, but I've been somewhat surprised by how much playing time Dempsey has gotten, especially after long international trips. In some situations, I'd rather have seen Siggy starting and Dempsey on the bench.",0,1361599659,null,0,false,0,c8k6j6c,t3_1920nm,t1_c8k6j6c,t1_c8k3img,null,1431380673,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

As for Dembele, it all depends who we play as the other midfield, if we can get a deep lying creative midfield, his ball carrying skills will be better off further up the pitch for little twists and turns deeper in the opponent's half. If we play a more attacking midfield, he would be better playing deeper and feed the AM with little through balls and helps Parker or Sandro to protect our back 4. I'm happy with how the team is playing right now with the personnel that we have, but it could all change over the summer if we bring in more quality players. 

The only concern is up front for us, I prefer Ade to play up front alone, he'll give us more options, especially for our wingers to whip the crosses in and he can also hold up play and bring others into the game.

Borrowing up, deficit reduction targets missed and extended, AAA rating gone, IMF advising against continuing plan A.  We are in the lost decade and have another 5 years before we come out. 
Unfortunately Osborne and his team as not brilliant enough to pull the country out of this downward trend.  Instead of boosting economic growth they continue to cut hard and fast. I am not saying Ed Balls would be any better, we'd probably have growth but at what cost? 
So are Labour to blame.  Yes, for over spending in the public sector without a contingency plan for failure.  No, didn't cause the melt down.  No, didn't cause the economy to stagnate, they handed over an economy growing at 3%.

Kids who have no concentration skills at all, because at toddlers they would be engaged in play and then boom, a GO COMPAREEE advert would come on tv and the child would stop what they were doing to stare at the tv. Kids who can't talk other than to say their own name and grunt a few meaningless sounds, because for 4 years they've watched nothing but waybuloo and in the night garden where the characters speak some strange baby talk, it's not because the parents are lazy, just busy or absent.

Parents are working longer hours, they get in from work and between cooking tea, washing clothes, ironing and bathing the kids, they're usually stuck infront of the telly.

Real wealth is created through production, yes.

So why have people unemployed today? The 2.5mn unemployed represent some 100mn man hours of potential labour lost every single week.

Why not simply [employ these people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_guarantee)? Print bonds, print money, it doesn't matter - it's much the same. Employ them, give them a minimum wage. They can then assert their demand on the private sector, the private sector which has ample room to grow to absorb them.

Prices don't rise as in a competitive marketplace a private company does not increase prices if they/their competitors could expand instead.

true,Dr3gun,num25-away,,"**Strengths**
GK/CB - Lloris with Jan/Kaboul are going to be an incredible triangle of excellence. Jan/Kaboul are both powerful, tall, quick and have leadership qualities. Jan has won 100% of his tackles so far. Lloris is literally commands his box, my main concern was him with corners but I think he's been pretty solid with them.

Bale/Lennon - All the attention Bale gets with the two man marking allows a lot more space for Lennon who has improved dramatically this season under AVB. We all know how good Bale is but I believe Lennon is the one that is leading Assts this season.

Midfield with Demeble and Sandro - I would argue that Dembele is actually suited better where he is currently. Sandro and Demeble seem of created an instant working partnership, as both know where and what the other is doing. This primarily means Dembele can push higher up the field as he knows that Sandro has got the back four well protected. Sandro did have the top interceptions in Europe before he got injured =\ 

AVB. Levy needs to nail this man down to a lengthy contract and then throw money at him. Incredible.

**Weaknesses**
Full Backs - Both Walker and BAE are good at going forward but have been shocking this season defensively. Walker has had some awful games so far, Lyon and Chelsea both come to mind. Thankfully he's still young and will improve. BAE is standard BAE, doesn't take anything too seriously which has caused some sloppy crosses/goals this season.

Strikers - Defoe can find the net yeah, but at what cost? Too many times he's shot on sight when there was a clear/better choice available. Admittedly he's done better at passing/linking up play in the first part of the season but recently before he got injured we was getting less than double digit passes in an entire game.  Adebayor can find a pass and bring in others but he can't find the net to save his life. He has several decent opportunities to score, none so more obvious than the open goal against Sunderland. 

**Opportunities**
Youth squad - I've said many times that I think we have one of the best youth squads in the UK, maybe even Europe. Certain players like Tom Carroll, Alex Pritchard and Adam Smith look very promising (I know I'm missing a few). Adam Smith in particular could break into the starting XI next season. 

Utility players - A player like Holtby/Dembele can play nearly anyway in the midfield. Siggy and Dempsey can/have been playing the wings allowing Bale to come in the middle and finding those scoring boots.

**Threats** 
Losing Bale - Won't go into this much as I don't think he's going anywhere this season.

Injuries - Key players like Sandro/Bale/Jan could be a disaster for us, certainly with players like Bale where we have no play near his quality of speed/ability to take a FK. Fortunately we have a great 23 man squad which has players that can fill said injured players roles (even if it's not to their quality) ",0,1361616571,null,0,false,0,c8k8pza,t3_1920nm,t1_c8k8pza,t3_1920nm,null,1431381845,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6
true,TheMania,null,null,"You're seeing a ""huge deficit"" as a problem. It's not. Let it happen. It's merely the government supplying the savings to the non-government that needs it.

As you say, money is debt. If we want net savings then, we need some other entity to accrue debt on our behalf. The government is the only entity that can accrue GBP denominated debt without threat of default. It can supply us with the savings we need to reach high employment. But we don't let it, because of a general misconception that a high deficit must be tamed. Yet if we simply didn't attempt to force it down below where it desired to go, we'd all be highly employed today.

If we simply realised government debt for what it is, non-government savings, any politician proposing to limit it in times of recession would be laughed out of parliament. But unfortunately we don't, we instead impose bizarre logic on the government that it must not supply us with these GBP-denominated net savings even when the economy needs them most. And why? For what?

&gt; Prices rise when you trash your currency and import most things.

The value of the GBP is determined primarily by the export capacity of the UK and our desire for imports. If you want a strong currency, you need a strong economy. The only people really damaging the currency today are those preventing the economy from reaching its potential.

&gt; How do we get from a total state mess that is run by a govt deficit to a well defined, competitive market place?

Only a young, mortgage happy country can be govt deficit free, for those are nations that do not (yet) desire net private sector savings.

* This video is a year old, and teams have learnt how to play against Barca, negating the exact effect Neville goes on about at the end: the fatigue high pressing causes. Now teams sit back, deep, against Barca and let them have the ball almost up to the defensive third. Look at how great Milan played this way. Moral: it might not be the best tactic to try to emulate exactly, given that (good) teams have started to negate one of its main attacking strengths.

* I think our midfield is still a bit too disconnected from our defence, and this is one of the problems we have with passing it from the back. Too often we've had Reina and our CBs passing it around, with no one to pass to further up the pitch. The FB are too high and wide, easy to cut off, and our midfield as been too far up the pitch, at best with a DM filling a central hole, but without the time to turn and pass up field. I think the Zenit game was the first time we got our positioning right, up until Allen was subbed off. (Though I was too excited to really pay attention to the tactics/formation.)

A similar question was asked of Clinton and Bush, ""On a personal basis how has [the national debt] affected you""

What the woman ought to have asked was of course how has the *recession* affected you, but she - like so many - blamed the debt for the latter when causation goes the other way.

A deleveraging private sector in recession results in high public sector deficits. It's a private sector that, due to uncertain times, doesn't want to take on debt and instead wants to accrue savings. Now the private sector cannot create savings on its own, it needs someone else to dissave. Either the public sector, or the foreign sector.

The currency-issuing public sector *can* simply supply those savings, but politicians/you/others end up blaming the debt for the problem it would resolve if we merely let it accrue. It's a real shame.

&gt;If our debt were only held domestically, perhaps, but it's not. 

What, the UK government is dependent on foreign GBP to operate? No, not at all - the GBP comes from here. All you're seeing here is the result of trade deficits from past years, don't fret though, we're never going to run out of people willing and able to buy bonds.

&gt;we are buying goods from overseas using foreign currency obtained by selling debt the holder expects the value to be retained

The UK's debt is entirely GBP denominated. If foreigners are buying bonds it's because they've acquired GBP from us via trade deficits to do so.

&gt; The UK's debt is entirely GBP denominated. If foreigners are buying bonds it's because they've acquired GBP from us via trade deficits to do so. If they decide they no longer want GBP worst case is we run a trade surplus for a few years reclaiming these long-sent-abroad GBP.

This is the bit that is the crunch. If they don't trade with us our standard of living will fall. Yes nominally we can still print GBP to the moon, but it's not going to stop standards of living falling. Yes, on paper it's fine, on the street, living standards fall.

I totally agree the deficit/debt is a function of other matters - it's a side effect not a root cause. I would say that as the debt gets larger the interest payments feed back into the recession as we spent more and more paying interest on it. The tipping point comes when rates go up due to confidence draining, which then results in the interest you pay going up even more. At this point people have lost confidence and will not accept GBP or if they do they want a good rate. The UK runs entirely on low rates now - from mortgages to indebted businesses.

Actually they don't. Net Italy contributes the 5th most money to the EU. (All money given minus all money taken).

In terms of how much they contribute to the EU countries are ranked as so:

1) Germany - £6.2 billion

2) UK - £3.5 billion

3) Netherlands - £2.5 billion

4) France - £2.05 billion

5) Italy - £1.3 billion

Under the new EU budget agreed in 2012 / 2013, Italy's and France's net contributions are set to fall even further, and Germany, UK and Netherlands are going to be paying more, pretty much everyone else stays the same.

We decided to drop some unique German letters such as the **ß** (doppel-s) which is basically just two s's together, and so you don't see it used so much in the German language anymore, and helps German industry and exports massively because it's an issue to print it on foreign packaging, for exports, tech stuff and other reasons.

For example, Fuß ('foot') has a long vowel, pronounced /fuːs/, and so was unaffected by the spelling reform; but Kuß ('kiss') has a short vowel, pronounced /kʊs/, and was reformed to Kuss. Other pre-1996 examples included Eßunlust ('loss of appetite'), and wäßrig ('watery'), but Wasser ('water').""


&gt;""The spelling reform affected some German-language forms of foreign place names, such as **Rußland** (""Russia""), now **Russland**, and Preßburg (""Bratislava""), now Pressburg.[10] The orthography of personal names (first names and family names) and of names for locations within Germany proper, Austria and Switzerland were not affected by the reform of 1996, however; these names often use irregular spellings that are otherwise impermissible under **German spelling rules**, not only in the matter of the ß but also in many other respects.""",0,1361625868,null,0,false,0,c8k9k2u,t3_191n20,t1_c8k9k2u,t1_c8k9du7,null,1431382239,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

But anyway, even if so you're not talking a massive blow. The trade deficits somewhere around ~$40bn a year, less than 1/10th of the export sector's ~$480bn of sales. The loss of the entire trade deficit worth of imports - or even a reversal to an equal magnitude trade surplus - still allows the UK a heck of a lot paid-for imports.

Again, being fully employed would be the best way to bring about people wanting the pound as an investment once more - unlike continuing down the path of austerity.

Argentina's debt was denominated in US dollars, a situation entirely different to the UKs. Additionally, the peso is intentionally devalued through purchases of foreign currency purchases by the central bank in order to try and prop up an export sector. On top of all that, the government runs deficits that it really ought not. If it merely reigned those in, or reversed the intentional devaluation of the peso, inflation could be stopped.

As William F Buckley put it

http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William_F._Buckley,_Jr.

&gt; Two Thousand Names. I am obliged to confess I should sooner live in a society governed by the first two thousand names in the Boston telephone directory than in a society governed by the two thousand faculty members of Harvard University.

Buckley was a right winger and he knew that the consensus in the faculty of Harvard was highly detached from reality.

The same is true of Jenkins and his ilk really. If I look at his last few columns I disagree with him on almost everything. Now in the Vicky Pryce case the jury was clearly not able to do its duty. Still the judge dismissed them and ordered a retrial. So the system worked.

Also 

&gt; One juror had just arrived on a plane from Nigeria. She was magnificently attired, apparently thinking a ""summons to the crown court"" was something from the Queen. The lady's English was limited, her knowledge of British justice non-existent and her faith in God profound. She was convinced he was guilty, but a couple of taxi drivers wanted to get back to work. When we let the rogue go, she wailed that we had let a killer loose. She was quite right.

People criticised the Daily Mail for [commenting on the racial makeup of the jury](http://politicalscrapbook.net/2013/02/daily-mail-suggests-vicky-pryce-trial-collapsed-because-jury-were-black/) and speculating that they didn't speak enough English to understand what was going on. I suspect Jenkins would agree. 

And yet here Jenkins is making the same point - he's commenting on the race of one juror to try to imply the whole system is so flawed it should be scrapped.

Of course the genius of the jury system is that you can have a few people with literally no idea what is going on because you only need a majority to convict.

Like Buckley I've got a lot more faith in 12 random English people than some sort of elitist system where Jenkins approved people decide. Basically I'd rather have a clueless minority like that poor Nigerian woman (who I'd probably like a lot more than Jenkins) than a clueless majority of Jenkins-clone Guardian readers. 

Actually I know a judge and he's a strong believer in the accuracy of juries - he thinks 98%-99% of the decisions they make are correct. In fact he said there have been lots of studies and this is not really in doubt.

Jenkins is using an anecdote about his jury service to make a point about the whole system.

That double substitution baffles me, if someone can explain to me why it would look like a good idea to substitute two players who were critical in our midfield control for two players that have not had experience nor play time for the last few months I would appreciate it.

I felt like our momentum flattened a bit after that double sub and I was screaming at the screen when it was obvious that Shelvey was not rising to the occasion and looked predictable and average (I might have forgiven that if his shot would have connected though).

And while I am ranting, Sterling on instead of Downing? Downing might not be our best player but he has experience with these kinds of games and it was obvious after Sterling came on that he simply is not strong enough and Zenit immediately knew how to counter him, reduce his space and close in on him. Two players were on him almost immediately when he got the ball, effectively removing him from the game and at that removed the right as a constant place of panic for Zenit like it had been up to that point and gave them the peace of mind they needed to start defending like beasts.

Like the WBA game i felt like our substitutions were badly timed and reduced the overall quality of our play.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Okay, a lot of these comments are way off base. Since this question has been posed from the perspective of the horse meat issue, I'll stick to meats etc.

Manufacturers of meat products and dairy products within the EU must mark their goods with a Health Mark. Look at the milk in your fridge, you'll find a small oval with something like ""UK AB001"". That is the manufacturing facility that produced your goods.

You speak of ""rogue factory"" as if this is common place within the food industry. 

Within the EU, all manufacturers are obliged to follow food safety laws, and part of those stipulations mean implementing a risk assessed system of managing food safety. (Called *HACCP*). 

This entire system is built on certain principles, which are required for the system to work. Pest control, traceability systems, hygiene, standard operating procedures, supplier approval for the reciept of raw goods, chill control where neccesary, etc.

This is the law, in the UK and in the EU. This law applies to your local kebab shop down the road, the local McD's, the Pizza Express resturant you sometimes visit, a small jam producing factory that only sells to local businesses, and all other sizes and scopes of manufacturers to the big facility who make millions of units per week sent out nationwide.

The size and scope of the operation and system may alter, as will the implementation, but they *must* have a food safety system based on risk assesment. 

These systems will be challenged, audited, reviewed, and altered as appropriate as time goes on. 

Telling a consumer where something was made doesn't give them any extra valuable information. If you knew your milk was made in London rather than Essex, what does that tell you about the quality of the product, how it was manufactured, or where the goods came from.

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt;Surely however the BoE is intentionally devaluing GBP in order to try and kick start exports and we run a deficit. 

The BofE isn't devaluing the currency in the traditional sense, which is simply printing money to buy foreign currencies. This really is an ass-backwards approach to employment, as it's selling money to foreigners below market rates so that they can employ your people *and take their produce*. All you get to show for it is a make-work job (+ associated multiplier jobs) and an accumulation of foreign currencies that you don't dare spend out of fear of hurting your (now) protected export industry.

Ass-backwards, but the approach that China Argentina and many other nations have employed to varying degrees of success. They could print the same amount of money, employ their own people directly, and this time *keep* the produce. This is the approach I advocate, as it isn't protectionist, it isn't make-work, it has the same impact on inflation, and a *lesser* impact on the exchange rate (as not all of it will end up on forex markets, unlike when you're deliberately devaluing your currency).

No, what the BofE is doing is different. It's buying government securities at market rates using ""new money"". In other words, when I asked you earlier ""am I richer if I have $1mn worth of bonds or $1mn worth of cash"" - the BofE is simply buying those bonds, and replacing them with cash. The net financial position, the buying power, of the private sector doesn't change through this approach, only its liquidity (and not even by that much!) - accordingly, it has minimal impact on inflation.

This was summed up beautifully in an article about how QE is having diminishing increases in inflation by geerussel [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/191kko/the_2_mystery_why_has_qe3_been_such_a_bust/c8k4vdn). That's all the BofE is doing - announcing an inflation target, and then going about replacing assets worth $X with cash worth $X. Other than misplaced investor expectations (something they're growing wise to now, hence the diminishing returns), it doesn't do much to devalue ones currency at all.

The real devaluation, again, is coming from the UK economy going deeper into recession largely due to austerity measures. The currency of a less productive economy is quite simply worth less.

&gt; Standard of living in the UK has gone down from around 2003 onwards. 

Our real consumption is everything we produce *less* our net exports. If we're not producing all we can, how can we be consuming all we can? With high unemployment our standard of living cannot meet its potential.

Give the unemployed a proper minimum wage, let them spend that growing the private sector, let our production grow. Austerity is the exact reverse of this - it increases unemployment, reducing the ability of the private sector to grow. It's entirely counterproductive.

&gt; I reckon there is a lot of underemployment plus fudging.

I think as far back from Thatcher to Brown they cut down regulations on banks and encouraged the boom in different industries thinking there would be no bust like there always is.

Also, the collapse of communities in the UK have a bigger impact on finances. Feels like when Thatcher took down mining sector it destroyed the communities which relied on them (sounds like earlier or at same time textile, pottery, cars, dockyards were also slowly allowed to die out instead of improve). Despite it being health destroying job, it was clear there seemed to be no kind of replacement for jobs from a new/old industry to support the families losing earnings. So generations likely ended up on the doll and on long term benefits, and society stagnated. Labour did not fix the issue, they did improve benefits and education but did not open up area of more jobs to fill the loss. Same goes with council housing, they got sold or got knocked down for improvements but newly built housing isn't affordable to house council tenants who end up drifting to areas which lack jobs and slowly these areas become troubled. Coalition government seem to be continuing the trend, but could be more destructive with cutting back. Economic and social issues all play big part in how balanced a country will be when it comes to financial well being.

The fact is the UKs AAA has been long dead in the water but only maintained because investers saw us as a safe haven from the Eurozone due to our freedom to print money (combined with an inflation target of 2%) and relative stability. Recently Draghi at the ECB came out at the same time as saying basically ""everything's ok, we are going to survive"" causing a huge Euro rally and a declining GBP divergence from the Euro sphere it usual inhabits. This was compounded by the recent BoE inflation letter where the bank basically said ""yeah we don't care about inflation any more"" (possibly as incoming Gov Carney favours nominal GDP targeting instead) but the combination of poor UK Econ data, renewed EUR confidence and the abandoning of the inflation target mean that time was called on our Rating. 

In the context of QE and inflation it should be noted that we have printed a lot of money, partially with the aim of devaluing the pound, but due to US open ended easing it hasn't worked. It's kept GBP high but pushed up inflation leading to a decline in real term wages. To carry on is a bit of a check mate situation and so something has had to give. 

The Treasury and the BoE could.i suppose have kept AAA alive but the inflation note looks like a deliberate ploy to discretely talk down the pound. While I am by no means a Political partisan, I must say honestly I think it was the Governments plan to loose the rating. I read that in PPP terms GBPUSD should be closer to 1.40 so there should be a lot more downside to go. 

However it is a dangerous game. The hoped for effect will likely be a pick up in manufacturing and exports which can pump some blood into the economy. I think BoE will print a further 50bln soon to add some weight to the downside momentum, Esp with the US sequester coming up which could counteract recent trends. But if things don't pick up, and the UK stays on a negative watch list then there could be trouble ahead.

My beef with the Gov is that in 2010 they had the perfect mandate for sweeping reform/action but they carried on as before (actually increasing spending). Maybe now that there is more stability and ultimately safety in being on the wrong side of the bond markets they will have the perfect combination of breathing space and urgency to fucking do something.

Scary to think that the cuts haven't even started yet. Now, for whatever reason before (cowardice, lib/lab blocking) we missed the chance to cut with the bond markets backing us. Now we can try it the hard way :)

All in, I don't think the end in near, if we go we take the world with us as we are so invested literally everywhere and vice versa and the home of several nefarious global financial ponsi schemes like rehypothication etc. There is an interest for the world to keep us afloat in a way that there isn't for France. We are too big to fail. Ahem. That is how one rolls.

Yes, but people don't work for money; money itself isn't useful.  They work for goods or services, like food, and a house, and a car.  Money is just used because it's easier than paying people in cars.

So if improvements in efficiency mean that everyone only needs to work a 4-day week to produce the same amount of stuff, and they all start doing that, then they're all going to get paid less; but that doesn't mean there's less stuff to go around, it just means the value of the money has changed.

If we have enough labour available for everyone to work a 4-, or even 3-day week, and still have a house and a car, why do we instead have some people working 5 days, and other people working no days?

true,Raffles_Dad,null,null,"&gt;Why employ somebody for minimum wage when you have a steady stream of jobseekers who will work for you for free if they want to keep their benefits?

This is the key point. People on Jobseekers have always been able to do none paid work to gain work skills and a line or two on your CV but this tended to be charities. Within every community in the UK you will find a need for people to work for charities in a number of roles but people that have been on jobseekers and looking for jobs have been told to stop working for charities (some in skilled posts) to stock shelves so companies can make a larger profit.

I recall a case of a young woman that was working for a charity (the national trust I think) in a role that was highly skilled, gave her experience, looked great on her CV and put her in contact with people that could offer her a real well paid role. She had her JSA threatened unless she gave up that role to stack shelves.  

A community project that I worked for (a public interest company) for a while wanted to offer posts for people on jobseekers, we put together a package of training (not just internal but from the local college as well) and a small benefits packet (meals, travel costs, a refurbished PC or laptop and £40 pocket money a week) and the DWP refused to consider it as acceptable as they considered that a job, when it was represented without the external training and benefits it was accepted.  

I have been long term unemployed and I have worked for charities (stacking shelves at one point) but if you going to force someone to work for you then they should be paid, and in my experience many people that go on these schemes end up out of pocket and with JSA you don’t have much excess in your budget to pay additional costs.

So props to Milan, but Barca were clearly also not firing on all cylinders--they failed to create anything from out wide and Iniesta and Fabregas got cluttered in midfield.
So I'd say there is nothing wrong with pushing for possession football when teams that utilize it well (Bayern, Barca) are incredible--in fact it speaks to their reputation Barca loses and it's a huge deal. 

On the second point, that's why Allen played so well in that DM position earlier in the season--he dropped back to keep possession. That's what Busquets does for Barca.

Also Allen probably isn't going to be a consistent starter in the first team for the rest of the season. We've really switched to a double pivot midfield of Gerrard and Lucas with Suarez in front of them in a free role, basically in a 4-4-1-1 or 4-2-3-1 formation. For Allen to be at his best he needs to be one of the sitting mids, he's not going to take Gerrard's or Lucas' spot, or one of the higher mids in single pivot midfield, 1-2, and both of things aren't very likely to happen.

true,[deleted],null,null,"So I did some research on Companies House about Poundland and found out a few interesting things for you (all figures are the latest 2012 to 2013):

They take in cash through their tills of £509,791,000 (over half a billion!) pounds per year.

Of that half a billion pounds, they make £23,396,000 profit. So they have a profit margin of 4.6%, which is a lot less than you might think really. A lot of people think these mega companies make billions in profit, but you can see 4.6% means things are actually really tough for them, and even a minor earthquake in the economy, or a tiny drop in sales would see them go bankrupt very quickly.

On that £23,396,000 profit they pay corporation tax of 24%, so **they pay £5,615,040 tax** (five and a half million pounds). It's interesting that you have to sell half a billion pounds worth of items, just to pay fix million pounds worth of tax.

They will also pay tax on all employee and director salaries, such as income tax and national insurance, which is where the government will get most of their money.

Each employee brings the company £76,066 in cash through the tills, however only £3,491 of that is profit.

The average staff salary is £10,937, not including the directors.

The average director salary is £100,083. The directors did voluntarily take a pay cut during the recession, some up to 80% of their pay, however pay has now returned to exactly pre-recession levels.

If you say it's their fault not ours, it validates their win at an election and can easily move the blame away from the current government's decision making. The political system in the UK is very populist and changeable in the fact it's very easy to change the government. Coalitions are like seeing a black rhino in the wild in this country. If something goes wrong, it's a great opportunity to the opposition to say ""well if we were in charge that wouldn't have happened"" then when they struggle to fix an issue say ""the past government left us with such a huge issue"" and use it effectively in any campaign. Unlike in places such as Germany where one of the coalition partner doesn't change apart from maybe once a decade. People will also accept this line of argument because lets face it this stuff is complicated and the government guys are supposed to know what they are talking about, right?. The seeds of any economic crisis are sown years, decades before the event. With our political system this means that maybe 8 different governments could have occurred before we see a recession. Our economic system is also not insular, we live in a globalised economy where the financial health of say China will have an impact on other countries economies. Companies are global and their financial standing can have a negative or positive effect on a States economy. It's also a natural part of capitalism to have peaks and troughs, make it Keynesian or Neo-liberal systems. 

It all honestly boils down to this stuff is complicated, it's easier and simpler to say it's labour's/conservative's/ the tea green parties fault rather than a whole explanation of each factor that contributed to a certain recession which can be mind boggling complicated.

Its an ambitious strategy that I totally support. 

That being said, I want to qualify some our errors in the back. This season we have made a huge jump to possession football. With possession football comes counter attack vulnerability. Even with a great back line a team is subject to defensive errors. Defensive errors come with this style of play. It's a given. I hate to make comparisons to Arsenal, but they are a perfect example for the EPL. They play really nice possession, but they have awful defensive errors.

Aside from Skrtel, our back 4 is very technically sound and I'd put Enrique, Johnson and Agger up against most other defense players in the world in terms of their footballing skill.  What Neville makes a point of talking about in that video is not the natural talent and ability of Barca.  That is exactly what he makes a point to not mention.  He talks about confidence and belief.  Barca make a mistake against Real trying to play it out of the back in the first few minutes of the match.  Clearly it isn't all about skill.  The point is that they stick with their game plan and retain belief in their ability to play it out of the back and wear down the opposition.

&gt; 1) Take a work experience placement at Poundland and continue to get Job Seekers Allowance.

&gt; 2) Turn down the job and stop claiming.

This isn't true.

Cait Reilly was *not* required to undertake this work experience placement, but the staff at the job centre *lied* to her, and said she did.

She was already getting work experience volunteering at a local museum, a field she was interested in pursuing and which might offer her a fulfilling career.

Ms Reilly could have rejected the supermarket work experience placement and continued receiving benefits, but she was misled by her job centre.

There is no significant training required to stack supermarket shelves, and it offers no useful ""work experience"" for anyone with half a brain.

The value of a ""work experience"" scheme at a supermarket is that the employer can see whether the participant is a decent worker, and that they turn up every day and on time, before they commit to employing them. It allows the supermarket to make an assessment of the employee's capabilities without putting them in the position that they've now got someone unreliable or lazy who they're unable to sack due to employment regulations.

It seems that the store at which Ms Reilly was placed was taking advantage of the scheme, because if they'd offered her a full-time job on completion of her placement she would presumably have taken it. This is evidenced by her current employment, which is in another supermarket.

Ms Reilly was not ""turning down a paid job"", because benefits isn't pay - it's considerably less than minimum wage.

Worse than that!

Did you see the link in TFA to the real BBC site, and the revelations that Duncan-Smith lied on his CV.

It's a bit dodgy this guy going on TV and radio to tell us how honest decent people should behave, when he's a proven fraudster himself.

The lies he made on his CV were clearly deliberate - he said he went to a famous Italian university when he in fact attended a language school in the same city! That's like me saying I went to Oxford because I once shagged an undergraduate.

Anyone who employed him on the basis of that CV would have been the victim of deception.

true,benfitzg,null,null,"What is productivity? Can any fair comparison be made? We have say productivity stats from 2006, before it all blew up, where people investing in property, taking out loans and then selling later at a higher price with no real value added, are ""productive"". Yet later when RBS are called out at 200 to 1 leverage and other liar loans cease the same company is said to not be productive. They are doing the same thing, but the context has changed - they no longer operate in a world where lending is assumed to be risk free, because this was a flawed assumption.

The UK ran on this world. Banking profits, housing credit pumped into the economy like mad, stamp duty on this pumped back into the Treasury. PFI put on the tab for some time after Labour left office.

I'd say the reason we see productivity way down is the change in the context in which companies in the UK operate. We are getting back to fundamentals of genuine wealth creation instead of games with debt. This has left the UK in a bad place. It's like changing the rules in football to disallow over head height - suddenly all your 6ft 2 players are no good. Debt games are the long ball of finance.

When I ""invest"" in a BTL at 100k and watch it rise to 300K before offloading on some poor young couple, I have been productive to the tune of 200K. The asset has sold in the market at 300K, the couple have a large mortgage at 10x joint income and can just make the payments. This is seen as productive by our debt based economy. It's the same house, nothing done to it. Just property pumping by the UK, where imputed rent makes up nearly 10% of GBP. The young couple now have to pay this down over 25 years, in a country with little to no wage inflation. The true cost of this on disposable income will echo down the years, with the money sucked up by banking. Where is the lasting wealth generation here? That will see us be more productive? Say this sale occurred in 2006 - productivity is up as the company makes a profit! But the mortgage commitment is 25 years. You can only farm the young every so often. We can't do this year after year, and it hurts their disposable income also.

Govt spending on credit hid these issues by changing the context. The the banking world blew up and we saw the true cost as incorrect assumptions hit home.

For me this is a central point. The Labour years were not ""normal"". They were a lie. It's not possible to easily disentangle all the numbers because we can't say what was real wealth generation and what was not. Information has been lost. How much of GDP growth under Labour was credit based and how much was real productivity gains? Hard to say - but certainly a lot of people thought they got a lot richer when housing tripled. We can now see this for what it was: inflation of a necessity, making us all poorer.

&gt; Our real consumption is everything we produce less our net exports. If we're not producing all we can, how can we be consuming all we can? 

On credit by running a trade deficit? We are paying interest on the debt that could be going on real goods every day.

Of course, the alternative is to have a play B, and I think with Sturridge in our side, we're very capable of doing that.

Even after age 16, when I had the legal right to opt myself out of religious assemblies (and wrote a letter to my headteacher requesting to exercise this right), I was denied and told that I must continue to attend.

Crucially, this petition relates to tax-payer funded schools that are NOT religious schools.  In fact, the petition calls for a poll of citizens of Edinburgh to gauge support for religious observance, as is stated in the Education (Scotland) Act of 1980, which states that education authorties must continue to provide religious observance (prayer, religious assemblies, etc) in school, until they conduct a poll of all electors in the area.

George Benson, Wembley Arena, 1993. It was pants, probably because the sound there is awful. Don't think I went to a gig for 8 years following. Then became an avid gig-goer, so much so that I now have complete gig apathy for an awful lot of genres. Think I had tickets to four things in the last quarter of the year and ended up not bothering with a single one.

David Bowie, Sigur Rós. Can't choose, won't choose.

I'd been wanting to see them for such a long time. Venue capacity, umm, 2000? I got there at early bird o'clock and got in the front row, right in front of Jonsi. The music was amazing. Amiina were there (the girls they often play with), they bought on a big brass band which reminded me of a scene in Heima (a film they made, spectacularly beautiful) and that made me cry. I imagine my joy must've been equal to what being off your head on drugs feels like. It was better than my wedding night. 

2. The Knife, about six years ago. Pretentious bollocks, hipster crowd that I wanted to hurt, also had painful four inch heels on. Then someone I intensely disliked turned up; he was actually having an affair with the girl I was there with and he turned up with his actual girlfriend and it was nasty and messy and he was doing a real number over on her and I didn't know where to put my face for wanting to swing at him. The combination made me walk out after three songs. 

3. David Bowie. Well, a recent article tells me he's probably 50/50 on touring his new album anyway. I'll believe it when my Facebook suddenly goes apeshit. No.2, as I believe there's talk of them regrouping: Slint. 

4. Nirvana, specifically their MTV Unplugged set when Cobain sings The Man Who Sold The World (Bowie thinks it's better than his own version, I'm on the fence). Runner up: Tim Buckley when he toured Live Letter in London (yes, Jeff's father).

5. DFA 1979 when they toured their first album. Had tickets, had a gig clash, sold them. Saw some footage and they're pretty shit hot live. THEN THEY SPLIT UP. I mean, really, who splits up after a first album?! Anyway, they got back together recently, and now I'm not that fussed (gig apathy mentioned in the other thread).",0,1361654135,null,0,1361659990,0,c8kfv39,t3_193hft,t1_c8kfv39,t3_193hft,null,1431385272,3,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,3

true,DeathByCocktail,,Rye Manhattan,"1. I go to a lot of gigs so there are a few that come to mind but the best was probably Siouxsie's solo show in Glasgow in 2008. The support band's bus had broken down somewhere en route, so we were left standing around for ages before she came on. Everybody was getting a bit arsey (as they didn't bother to tell the crowd what was going on initially) but when the set started it took the roof off the place. Magic.

2. Probably Cradle of Filth in 98 I think? I was half pissed and a load of mates were going to see them, and had a spare ticket. Fuck me, that was dire. I don't get black metal (or whatever they are) anyway but really, sod that shite, it was just noise.

3. I've seen most of the bands and artists I want to, I think but if The Cure ever get their heads out of their arses and play actual gigs, as opposed to horrendously expensive one-offs or festivals, then I'll go and see them. Missed a couple of chances in the past but their last album was dire so I'm sort of in two minds about seeing them live- I think that sometimes it's better to keep the idea of how a band might be live than see them and be disappointed.

4. The Ramones. The sods had to go and die on us.

5. Again there are a few but missing Bauhaus in 06 really sucked. My then boss was a big fan (as am I) and we were going to go but were snowed under at work and were gutted when mates started emailing us about how good the gig was.

But at the end of the day, the collapse happened because millions of people worldwide borrowed more money than they could repay, banking on ever increasing house prices to cover the cost of their debt. When a lot of those who clearly shouldn't have been lent money stopped paying and when people finally said they weren't prepared to accept rocketing house prices any longer, the whole house of cards came tumbling down.

WE caused the crisis, not the govt, not the banks - they just lent us money we asked for.  God forbid you should have to wait a couple of months to buy that big TV you can't afford right now.

true,Twiggy3,,Whisky!,"&gt;Best gig and why

Probably Blaze Bayley at The White Rabbit, Plymouth.  I had just started listening to loads of his stuff, just needing to listen to more and more, so seeming him live was amazing.  The venue was very small, so I was inches away from one of my favourite musicians/songs-writers for an hour and half.  From that point I got more and more into his stuff, got the biography and was a huge fan until things went a bit pear-shaped.  As a result his music declined and I saw him for the huge sell-out that he had become.

&gt;Worst gig and why

Probably Evanescence in Plymouth, two years ago.  The band seemed to be lacking in energy and the singing was a bit off.  The audience was mostly posers and teenagers who seemed to spend more time taking pictures of themselves there rather than actually enjoying the music.  Not only that, but some random guy decided to attack me, because I declined the advances of some random woman...strange.

&gt;Someone you desperately want to see and stand a real chance of actually seeing one day

Iron Maiden, again.  The only two times I've seen them I've been in seated, I want to be in standing!  Luckily I'm seeing Steve Harris British Lion this year.

&gt;Someone you'd love to see but have no chance to (death, their health, haven't toured since 1973, etc)

Probably Genesis (with Peter Gabriel) or Queen (In their early days).  Or any Adrian Smith solo band (Urchin, A.S.A.P., The Untouchables, Psycho Motel)

&gt;A gig you missed that you kicked yourself for, and why

It didn't. As you point out

My mate pulled some really gorgeous girl too...but he kept screaming for help when she was snogging him. How we laughed!

2. Probably 90% of Reading 2011. I decided to go with my ex and a few of her friends because, despite the odd choice of company I really wanted to go at least one year and Muse, Pulp and the Strokes were headlining.

As for the special relationship card, I'd say America has stronger grounds for suggesting the existence of such a relationship than Germany on account of the shared language and the unique historical ties between the two countries. 

That said, this same special relationship could also be suggested between us and Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and a bunch of other former colonies. We've been around, and have a lot of ""child states"" that we have strong connections with. This puts us in a unique and advantageous position when it comes to foreign policy. 

Considering just how prolific the UK is from all the crazy misadventures we got into back in the days of empire, there's probably more countries than not out there that can claim some kind of special relationship with us.

true,RabidRaccoon,cnty-expat,Expat,"&gt; the homocide rate will have probably increased because, since 1965, the population has increased, 

It's ""homicide rate"" and it is quoted as a *rate per million population* so there's no reason why that should be the case.

&gt; and more technology of murder has been invented.

Actually the ""technology of murder"" should if anything have got more primitive. 1967 was pre handgun ban for a start. So theoretically it should be harder to get hold of guns post ban than then. Of course since criminals don't tend to use legally owned handguns for fairly obvious reasons that is not the case. 

Still there's no sign that a significant percentage of modern murders would have been technologically impossible in 1967. Actually if you want to kill someone you can do it with a kitchen knife.

Another explanation of course is that criminals fear the criminal justice system less now than they did then. Given that back during the days of the death penalty murderers could be hanged. When the death penalty was abolished we were assured that criminals ""would spend life behind bars"". 

Now of course ""whole life tariffs"" are seen as a terrible human rights violation

http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/dec/05/whole-life-prison-sentence-human-rights

&gt; Vinter, and convicted murderers Jeremy Bamber and Peter Moore, have now launched an appeal against the decision to uphold their whole-life sentences at the European court of human rights. In January, Strasbourg judges ruled four-to-three that the three lifers condemned to die behind bars are not having their human rights breached. The president of the court was the British judge Sir Nicolas Bratza. Surprisingly, he voted to uphold whole-life sentences in England and Wales – surprising because, three years earlier, in another case at the European court, he had said: ""I consider that the time has come when the court should clearly affirm that the imposition of an irreducible life sentence, even on an adult offender, is in principle inconsistent with article three of the convention."" (Bratza, whose term as president has since ended, did not respond to our request for a comment.)
&gt;
&gt; Lawyers had argued that it was an infringement of article three of the European convention on human rights, which gives protection against ""inhuman and degrading treatment"". That case was heard at the first chamber of the European court. After it was rejected, lawyers applied to the grand chamber, which granted a rare appeal. If the appeal succeeds, ministers would have to create a system of examining whole-life criminals at regular intervals to see if they are safe to let out. At the moment, the assumption is they will simply die in prison.

Now you can serve as little as two years for killing someone

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/8270909.stm

&gt; The sister of a man who died after being punched by a 15-year-old boy in South Yorkshire has attacked the two-year sentence given to the teenager.
&gt;
&gt; Jonathan Harper, 47, had just left a pub in North Anston, near Rotherham, on 15 May when he was attacked and fell into the road where a car hit him.
&gt;
&gt; The boy, who admitted manslaughter, was ordered to be detained for two years.
&gt;
&gt; Mr Harper's sister Susan Cantillon said: ""I don't think it gives a strong enough message to the youths of today.""
&gt;
&gt; Speaking outside Sheffield Crown Court, she said she did not blame the judge, saying sentencing policy was the government's responsibility.

So since the 60's we've gone from [the death penalty for saying ""let him have it""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Bentley_case) to two years for attacking someone resulting in their death.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment_in_England_and_Wales#History

&gt; When Parliament was considering abolition of the death penalty, there were many MPs who were against the reform, and the deal offered was that former capital offences would always inevitably merit a mandatory life sentence. Accordingly, life imprisonment replaced the death penalty as punishment for murderers, firstly for those whose sentences were commuted and later for those whose crimes were not ""aggravated"" within the meaning of the Homicide Act 1957. To begin with, it was fairly common for those sentenced to life to be released in around ten to fifteen years.[3] As time passed, it came to be thought that longer sentences should be imposed, especially in cases such as the Moors Murders, the Yorkshire Ripper and Dennis Nilsen. The Home Secretary (and now the Minister for Justice) was empowered to make Whole Life Orders to ensure that particularly dangerous or heinous criminals were never released. Presently mandatory lifers serve an average of 14 years and for other lifers the average has been in decline and now stands at nine years

Give it another couple of decades and ""life"" could you spend five years in prison.

Rival Schools in a tiny old punk venue. There's just some folk who know how to put on a good show and Walter is one of them. Fugazi were also excellent, Guilty Simpson, Her Name Is Calla and a load of Exeter bands of my youth (Quiller Memorandum, Callum Mixes Paint, Annalise, etc). The Computers are good also.

&gt; Worst gig and why

I saw Maximo Park around the time they got signed, a friend said he'd heard good things and invited me down. They were absolute shite, enough that he offered to refund our tickets after the first song (by which time half the crowd had decided to sit it out in the bar). Proper posers without any stage presence or decent songs. Saw them later on tele and thought they looked quite good actually.

&gt; Someone you desperately want to see and stand a real chance of actually seeing one day

I'd love to check out the Havana music scene, although I'd be embarrassed by my dancing. So much good music has come out of there... For proper bands I'd love to see Calle 13 or D'Callaos the most I think

&gt; Someone you'd love to see but have no chance to (death, their health, haven't toured since 1973, etc)

Camarón de la Isla is dead, so that rules him out. The guy revolutionized flamenco, there will never be another like him. Orishas haven't done anything together in a few years but haven't officially split up, so there's some hope there.

From a UK retailer perspective, there is a standard set by BRC, (British Retail Consortium) an independent body setting standards for which the major retailers subscribe to, in the main. It's a challenging standard and it is reviewed and changed fairly frequently, I think at the moment it's on Version 6. 

On top of that, you have ISO 22000, an EU standard for food safety management systems, A standard which the majority of the retailers require compliance to. Once again, this standard is reviewed an improved frequently, and manufacturing sites which are accredited against this standard are challenged on a regular basis.

On top of that, you have the standard for HACCP, set by Codex Alimentarious, another independent group who define the standard and expectation for the risk assessed basis for which all food business operators must follow. (Or implement a system based on).

On top of that, all of the individual retailers will have their own internal standard for food manufacturing which tr manufacturer will be expected to follow. Tesco, Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury and onwards have their own standard, reviewed regularly and challenged by an expert team. 

To say that the standards are antiquated is simply not the case. Yes, something cocked up in the system to allow the horse meat through, but that in reality comes down to people falsifying records and poor auditing that didn't pick that up, in my opinion.

As someone who works for a manufacturer of products found nationwide, I an assure you tht our standards are constantly challenged.",0,1361668076,null,0,false,0,c8kjfq3,t3_190nuj,t1_c8kjfq3,t1_c8ki992,null,1431386963,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt; On credit by running a trade deficit?

The UK trade deficit is less than 1/10th of its exports. That's hardly ""on credit"" - if the entire trade deficit closed up tomorrow it'd barely change anything. The export sector would grow, imports would decline a bit, and local production of many goods/services would increase.

&gt; We are paying interest on the debt that could be going on real goods every day. 

This real interest is negative, below inflation. That GBP goes overseas, to people that may well buy UK exports with it someday. That's the only real concern with trade deficits - that you may end up sending even more exports later to pay them back. Today though, with real negative interest even that is not a concern.

The rest of your post was most interesting, however I think we can both agree today labour is well and truly underutilised. You said it yourself - underemployment is likely fudging the unemployment numbers to some degree. My observation of GDP was merely that.

FWIW, I'm quite opposed to the central banking model in general. I don't agree that all money should be created by loans, I'd prefer to see it created by public sector deficit spending in addition to loans. That way if a spending crisis presents, we merely spend more, and if spending becomes too high for production (inflation) we merely tax more. Perform price stabilisation through automatic stabilisers rather than a central bank, end the super-privileged position banks get by being the gatekeepers to new money, and make full employment and price stability the main two goals of government. I go into the benefits of this approach at great length [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/18j2ga/can_someone_explain_like_i_m_five_what_causes/c8fmbjy?context=3) - it's a system proposed by the Australian economist [Bill Mitchell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mitchell_(economist\)), and imo it's vastly superior to the current model.",0,1361674314,null,0,1361685042,0,c8kl1zt,t3_191nv5,t1_c8kl1zt,t1_c8kdk83,null,1431387722,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

This is the [supposed mother of Jemima.](http://i.imgur.com/8YWc7na.jpg)

One reason to be suspicious is that we never see proof of Victoria filming Jemima's death. We never see the actual video that Victoria would have shot.

When the director starts playing the video and says ""You shot it"", [this is the video that we see.](http://i.imgur.com/Gd1bu5J))

That does not look like a child in the middle of an abduction.

Second reason for suspicion, the Justice Park is named White Bear. Was it created and named after this murder case, where a white stuffed bear became symbol? Does this compound exist only to punish Victoria?

Or is it more likely that they have several inmates with several fictitious story-lines where a white bear is inserted?

Also, note that when the director is briefing the public, there is no mention of murder or punishing a criminal. He does say, ""Let's make this show happen.""

I think that's our strongest back four defensively (considering the form of Cahill and CB Ivanovic lately). 

Mikel - Lampard is probably our best midfield pair in terms of balance and we need Frankie's experience for this one.

The inclusion of Ramires is to help out in midfield when necessary, to track back against the little overloads Man city likes, and I think his counterattacking will be a very important outlet all things considered.",0,1361688336,null,0,false,0,c8kok1i,t3_193m99,t1_c8kok1i,t3_193m99,null,1431389552,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

At what point did they say ""have all the kids you want, and *you* explain to them why they all sleep in one bedroom""?

It's all well and good to say that we should help everyone in need. I completely agree that if you can help someone in need, you should. But that doesn't give everyone else the right to abuse the system. It certainly doesn't mean that we should encourage people to abuse it by making it so lucrative. This woman had absolutely no reason to have so many children. It's clear that she cannot afford them. It's absurd to think that someone forced her to do it. It's equally absurd to think that she couldn't afford to buy enough condoms to keep them from plopping out.

So why do we allow this? Why don't we allow her to have a certain number of kids (perhaps 2, to maintain the population at least), and then sterilise her once she surpasses it? And don't tell me that it's unfair to her to be sterilised - it's unfair to *everyone else* for her to believe she's entitled to keep reproducing when she's so obviously unfit to do so.

So the only argument left, I suppose, is that it would unfair to the children to withdraw benefits. Yes, it would. But preventing those children from ever existing is not unfair to anyone.

With regard to foreigners, apart from refugees (who are treated via different procedures anyway), if a person enters a country illegally, he has **absolutely no right to expect benefits**. If you start by breaking the law, don't expect the law to favour you. What's enigmatic to me is why people want those immigrants to be supported. How can that possibly not exacerbate the problem?

Lastly, I know that it's a relatively small problem.

Depends what you mean by 'causes'. In people with these conditions, yes, it can most definitely exacerbate things, I'm a walking example. However, it isn't the governments job to protect me from this. If it was, alcohol, caffeine and nicotine would have to be illegal too, since they all too exacerbate mental health problems - especially caffeine, which is a very potent anxiogenic, and nicotine, which has very strong links with schizophrenia (at least as strong as cannabis).

You even admit, in your post, that it's far less dangerous than alcohol or tobacco. So are you also in favour of making those illegal? If so, that's an opinion you are free to hold, but I'm curious if you genuinely are that consistent.

Copyright infringement is a civil, not a criminal, wrong. The penalty is damages related to loss, which is pretty low for small/accidental actions. Plus, civil wrongs are not ""illegal"" per se.

Abstracting electricity has to be pretty serious to be prosecuted by the CPS - nothing will happen if you plug a phone into an outlet. If you're permanently stealing electricity at significant cost to someone then obviously that should be punishable.

Speeding is obviously illegal, but the penalty for reasonable is pretty low - it's a reasonable and proportionate penalty, and most drivers accept the possibility of receiving it. It is served by penalty notice and will not result in a criminal record.

In contrast, anyone smoking weed is fully aware that they risk severe penalties if caught, and even if they get a slap on the wrist they'll have a criminal record and never be allowed into the US.

Might also be an idea to go and speak to some local temp agencies now, so they have your details way ahead of your preferred time frame.

In the Bar academy which was a little 200 standing venue next door to the actual academy. The show they put on was intense, clearly a small budget, their lighting show consisted of some finger lights of green and blue that they gave out to the audience. I was right at the front it was fantastic. They had huge ambition as to their lights as was evident in their show at the Astoria just after the release of Take to the Skies but nothing will replicate the atmosphere in that room. 

Worst gig, again a band I have grown out of, I never really liked them at the time but was dragged along by my mates - Bring me the Horizon. Awful, even my mates who did like them said it was a shit gig, either their noise boy was shit or the band was shit, maybe both but it was just a mess that sounded nothing like their studio tracks and was literally just an hour of noise, I moved to the bar after a couple of songs and my mates joined me not long after.

That makes it sound like he's *making* less money which is not true. 

Consider a first time buyer, something many of the people who are downvoting dctctx above probably hope to be.

He buys a modest flat for £100,000, putting down 10 grand of his own as a 10% deposit. He now owes the bank £90,000 and thanks to capital interest on a 25 year loan he'll have paid absolutely fuck all of that back in the first three years. 

During this time prices drop 20%, not unheard of. His flat is now worth £80,000 yet he still *owes* the bank around £85,000. Not only has he lost his £10,000 deposit, he is actually *in debt* to the bank. Should he wish to move (e.g. for work) he needs to pay off the extra £5,000 then pony up even more for the deposit on the next place. He's fucked and that's just a 20% drop.

This isn't about ruining someone's nest-egg, it's about bankrupting people. What's worse is that in this situation the banks stop offering 10% mortgages because of the risk and the market crashes further. Who cares if the prices drop 30% overall if you have to put down a 25% deposit instead of 10% just to get on the ladder? 10% of £100,000 is far less than 25% of £70,000.",0,1361710525,null,0,1361710811,0,c8krdrr,t3_194le1,t1_c8krdrr,t1_c8kqqiz,null,1431390829,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

The gap between incomes and house prices has been growing wider and wider [source](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/borrowing/mortgages/9481892/House-prices-rise-at-three-times-the-rate-of-wage-inflation.html) and you are as much a victim of this as anyone else. Average income has regressed to where it was over 10 years ago. [source](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/regional-trends/regional-economic-analysis/changes-in-real-earnings-in-the-uk-and-london--2002-to-2012/art-changes-in-real-earnings-in-the-uk-and-london--2002-to-2012.html) so for someone on a low wage the very idea of house ownership is untenable. So the only way out of this is to provide housing affordable to people on low incomes. This may cause the current housing market to stabilise back to where it should be which maybe bad for some how have unwisely invested.

It depends very much on how you view house ownership. If you see it as an investment then you're making a bet just like any other investment. Normally a pretty safe bet but there have been plenty of house price crashes in the past to know that this isn't always the case.
If you view a house as a dwelling that you will live in not as an investment then the movement of house prices over the short term (5 years or so) is largely irrelevant. If you want to move to somewhere else all other prices will be lower, so all things being equal whats the issue? Over the long term prices will rise again.

We have a dire shortage of housing in this country, house builders prefer to build bigger luxury housing as they have better margins. How ever your normal first time buyer cannot afford these. We're in the ridiculous situation where builders have to be legislated to build dwellings people can actually afford. 

There is a wider issue here of poor urban planning and lack of decent high density housing design and conservative tastes leading to people wanting to buy hideous Barratt boxes which are neither sustainable or affordable prices, not places designed to have low embodied energy and overall efficiency.

This has developed into a bit of an essay and I've track. Any critique welcome.

There's a bit of a difference here. The point is that his house is already worth less than what dctctx paid - in other words, he can't move house. Not until that problem's solved. Because at best, it'll sell for £5,000 less than what s/he owes the bank. The bank is probably moderately relaxed about that right now but they won't be if dctctx tries to sell the house - a mortgage is secured on property you own, without the property there can be no mortgage.

Moving house when there's a sale/purchase involved is expensive. Costs of around £5-6,000 if you're selling one house to buy another are pretty typical. Which means that dctctx is in the hole to the tune of around £10,000 if s/he needs to move house. And will have to scrape together the money for another deposit because there's no equity in the current house to use.

It's not much better if dctctx decides to move into rented accommodation. S/he still needs to pay a solicitor to deal with selling the existing house, still needs to pay an estate agent's fee (anything up to about 2.5% of whatever the property sells for) and needs to find the money for a deposit on rented accommodation. 

This isn't necessarily the end of the world provided you're in a stable job, your mortgage payments don't go up and your circumstances don't change for however long it takes to clear the negative equity. With the economy as it is right now, I'd argue that very few of us have a stable job.

true,Captain_English,null,null,"I write this as a mortgaged home owner myself. I make one underlying assumption: that you need somewhere to live. 

You're stuck with the negative equity regardless. 

Even if your house sells for exactly what you owe on it, you're not debt free because you have to buy another one. Either you make that a lot smaller, or you have to get another mortgage. 

Even if you house suddenly doubles in value, you're still screwed - whatever increase your house has made, unless you're downsizing or moving to a worse area, will be totally eaten up by a proportionate increase in the next house you buy. Worse, if everything increases and you want to upscale, the mortgage you need to purchase a better house will also have increased in size accordingly. Unless your salary has followed suite, you'll then be stuck with even more going out each month. 

*money in your house isn't real money*

You can't spend it. You can't make a profit from it, unless you buy ambitiously and downsize - but you'll still be taking a hit on either mortgage costs or if you had the capital lying round to begin with opportunity cost. 

You're in the position you are in because you've taken a mortgage you can't afford. Ignore the equity of your house, it is entirely irrelevant - it doesn't affect what you owe, which was clear when you signed up for it. I understand you had to do so to buy a house, but the only difference it makes is whether or not you can flog yours, wipe your mortgage out, and roll the dice again. 

Lower house prices would help you. You could sell yours, swallow the 10k hit as your mortgage residual, but get more for your money in a new house with a proportionately smaller mortgage and ideally reduced outgoings.

It's particularly strange because a single house that anyone owns is not an investment. It's only an expense. Rising house prices benefit only people who own two or more houses, or those who are willing to sell theirs *and move into a smaller, shittier one*. A homeowner with a single house loses, not benefits from rising house prices.

Homeowners start with buying a house, and as their career improves, sell it and buy a better one. If house prices rise, the value of their current house increases, but so does the price of the next one, *and the gap between their current and next house*. They can't ever realise the value increase of their current house as profit, unless they are willing to move into a relatively cheaper one (which most people don't - they expect to move into better accommodation as they get older and start a family).

If house prices fall, both renters and people who own a single house benefit. Rents are lower, and the price you can get from selling your current house is lower. But you always need some place to live, so the price gap between your current house and the next one you might move into is also smaller.

It can be psychologically frustrating to owe the bank more than a house is worth right now - but that makes absolutely no difference in actual economic tradeoffs. The money you owe to the bank is fixed, and you can't ever realise the ""investment"" from a first house anyway, as you need to buy/rent another one if you sell it.",0,1361712468,null,0,false,0,c8krlda,t3_194le1,t1_c8krlda,t1_c8kr72d,null,1431390930,31,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,31

The government could cause large numbers of houses to be built without any net spending. Then housing benefit would go away because it wouldn't be needed any more.  Here's how it works:

At the moment large property developers buy land at agricultural prices, and get planning permission which multiplies the value of the land by 10. This is  all kept by the developer as profit even though they have delivered nothing of value. 

The government should change the law so that local authorities get to keep this money instead, and use it to help build affordable housing. 

The local authority would buy a plot of land, award itself planning permission, and build say a dozen houses. Some of these would be sold to offset the costs of the project. The rest would be rented out or sold in part equity schemes. 

For those who like the private sector, local builders could be hired to build the houses, local estate agents could be used to sell them, and housing associations could be used to manage the rented accommodation.

You don't magically become a multi-millionaire overnight simply because your name's on the title deeds at the Land Registry. For most of us, all it means that instead of having a landlord (who, despite all his faults, still has to fix the boiler when it blows up) we pay rent to, we have a bank we pay a mortgage to.

Just like the landlord can kick you out if you don't pay the rent, the bank can kick us out if we don't pay our mortgage. But that's pretty much where the similarity ends.

The bank doesn't have to fix anything that breaks down. That's your problem.

The bank doesn't have to decorate the house. That's your problem.

The bank doesn't care how much it costs to get a tradesman in (clue: A surprisingly large amount. You'll be lucky to see change out of £150/day in the provinces, £200/day in any decent-sized town. Probably rather more in London). That's your problem.

The bank doesn't have to care about the fact that half the windows are letting a draught in, nor do they care about that ominous damp patch appearing in the kitchen ceiling (which happens to be directly beneath the bathroom). (Second clue: Water is possibly the most damaging and expensive thing known to man. It dissolves plaster, damages brickwork and encourages mould which can make you very sick). That's your problem.

The bank doesn't have to care about the chimney flue that you've just discovered is made out of asbestos. That's your problem.

And all this so one day in about 30 years time, you don't have to pay rent or mortgage to anyone.

true,thejdcole,flair2,,"Getting tickets for spurs games can be quite difficult especially if it's a high profile game, you need to see when tickets first come on sale, and be awake at an ungodly hour to try and buy them. If you're only buying one ticket (rather than a pair etc.) then you should be able to get some with reasonable ease, especially for games against sunderland etc.

I've only ever sat in the upper tier of the north stand, but south stand I would say is definitely the loudest, although i think getting tickets in south stand might be harder. If you sit in east stand there is the possibility of an obstructed view due to the pillars (when you select a seat to buy a ticket, it will inform you if the view is obstructed.) West stand would possibly give you the best view (side to side), however I have no problem viewing the game from top to bottom like you would find with sitting in north or south stand. 

When it comes to viewing games from sitting in either the lower or upper tier, i've found with lower you are closer to the action, and get a larger feeling of how fast our guys really are running. If you are sitting in an upper tier you get a much larger view of the game, you can see team tactics and movement more easily.

I hope that helps, and I hope you manage to get some tickets for your journey over here!

true,Evis03,cnty-uk,Welshman-on-Mersey,"I'm 25, with steady employment and a rare skillset that can command quite a high salary- and I've pretty much given up on ever owning my own home. These days I drift where the work is (my skilset is partially rare because there are only a handful of vacancies in the country at any one time) and try to get into staff accommodation wherever possible, usually going for the cheapest option that still affords me one decent sized room. With one good sized room I'm happy, and being a cheap son of a bitch leaves me more money for beer, videogames and needing to save up for the next (inevitable) move.

I have no stability in my life so I pretty much drift from day to day. The only meaningful relationships I create with people are friends form uni who I keep in touch with online and see in the flesh maybe once every two months. Apart from that I have virtually no social life to speak of as there's little point meeting people I'm going to need to wave goodbye to in a year tops anyway.

On the plus side the money I've saved means I can buy loads of consumer crap. Well it would do if I had a home to keep it all in. As it stands I don't buy many physical goods or long term 'assets' and instead fritter my money away on ephemeral crap and digital goods that offer little to the national economy.

Perhaps I'm deluding myself but I feel that the rest of my generation suffers from the same disenfranchisement, not only with the nation but also with their own future. I think that's born out a lot in the attitude to politics I see in my generation- a lot of the 'fuck the lot of them' you'd expect people to grow out of once they get their teenage years out of the way. When you can't land a steady job (even if you can manage steady *employment*) despite being educated, willing and able it's bad enough. When you can't even get a home to call your own because of that and a grossly expensive housing market it's even worse.

So fuck the lot of them.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Amy should have been erased by the crack in the universe, instead of Rory. Let Rory eventually remember, but then go on finding himself, picking up the pieces, as he explores the universe. Let him eventually fall in love again, this time with someone who respects him from the start.

Amy treated her boyfriend/fiance/husband like shit every other day. A person who tries to cheat on her husband-to-be the night before their wedding, and then tries kissing another man and flirts with that man hours after her wedding... has deep and dividing problems.

We see this in Series 7, Asylum of the Daleks, where Rory declares that they both know he loves her more than she loves him... and not just because he waited outside her box. And at various other moments in Series 6 we see Rory doubting Amy's love for him, such as in the Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon when Amy is gone, but Rory can hear her talking. Rory knows what's up, even if Amy has an excuse for everything.

Moffat wrote her with a deep, dividing character flaw and then flippantly tried to say, ""All better now! Just forget that stuff I did because my maturity turns on a dime."" Infidelity is the worst action possible in a relationship (short of attempted murder), and attempted infidelity is the same as successful infidelity. 

Yes, Moffat changed Amy in The Power of Three where he jumps us 10 years into Amy's future. The difference in her character is huge, but viewers didn't share in the experience of her arriving at that difference. Moffat rushed her development in the biggest way by just pushing us into seeing future snippets of her life after she changed, not while she was evolving as a person. Amy's Choice is the closest thing to seeing her evolve, but after the who-do-I-love issue was supposedly settled, we saw her old behavior resurface (which is normal for a person who cheats in relationships).

I studied at a mid-tier university. Not great by any standards, but not awful either. Actually, I had to contact Cambridge while working on my application because my school was not included in their standard list of undergrad institutions. They had never heard of it so it had to be added. So that alone didn't bode to well for me. However, despite the embarrassment, I don't really think this had any bearing on my application. Generally speaking, I think (or would like to think) that universities will naturally give preference to students who come from big prestigious schools, but when it comes to the ""lesser"" universities, the focus is more on individual performance and extracurricular activity. I finished with a very good record and tons of extracurricular activity from my alma mater, but that often isn't enough when it comes to Cambridge...or any university on that same level. 

As this application was for a Master's level program, I will certainly be submitting another app. when I am ready to apply for my PhD...assuming I am accepted to a Master's program elsewhere.

However, we NEED a metric fuckload of reasonable quality, easily affordable homes in this country and we need them now.  Get people homed first, at a reasonable expense, that gets people employed, drops the housing benefit bill, and gets MORE people employed as people have a solid address that they can apply for jobs from, as you're not getting a job while you're homeless.

In my opinion, owning a home in my area is a crazy dream only available to bankers and lottery winners, as I'm looking at a quarter million for anything reasonable, and nearer half a million for a nice family home, 3-4 bedrooms.  At median wage, that's 20 years wages, IF I spent nothing!  At present, I may be able to find somewhere cheap when my parents die, as their place is a good £400k, split at least 3 ways, I may find a small flat somewhere cheap, and at least not have to pay rent any more.

As it is, I live only 10 miles from my parents and I'm only paying around £90 a week in rent.

North Court - Generally older rooms, with a range of variety between rooms. More pot-luck as to what you get. All rooms have a bed, desk, wardrobe, chair(s) and almost all have a sink. There are some newer rooms (x staircase and s staircase) which have just been/are being refurbished. North Court also tends to have a better atmosphere and social bonding than South Court. Gyps (kitchens) are basic, and shared between 2-3. Showers tend to be shared between 5-6. Staircases tend to be in the range of 12-20 people

South Court - Rooms are much more standardized, but do not have quite the same unique feel as North Court Rooms. They are mostly grade 3-4. South Court has the advantage of being closer to the bar, and has slightly more people than North Court. Again, there are about 14 per staircase, all single person rooms.

Overall, it doesn't really matter where you choose. I prefer North Court, but that is personal preference. And good luck getting a pool table in your room, that would be tricky...

- Lampard's good penalty gets saved by Hart. Fine. But why substitute him? Hardly makes any sense and hardly instills any confidence in him.
- The work ethic from Ramires can never be doubted but sometimes he just doesn't perform. He was on a yellow card and not playing well yet Rafa doesn't see that he clearly needs replacing by Oscar or Moses. Not Lampard.

- Bringing on Torres was fine. Decent idea, might as well take a chance. But by taking Mikel of, in spite of him having a poor game today, was not a decent idea. It leaves our defence very thin and weak - the obvious choice is to take Ramires of the wings but, yet again, Rafa doesn't see it.

- The only positive from today was Cahill and Cech. They were excellent.

Very disappointed from today. Hazard was having a good game and got substituted. Lampard was having a decent game and got substituted. Eugh. The sooner Rafa is out the better. Extremely poor decision making today.

1. Read outside the subject. Take extra maths modules, or at least read some of the more advanced textbooks that your school won't get on to cover. It will be very benificial when you arrive and is something I wish I had done. If you know FP3 and M4/5 then life will be alot easier, and it shows initiative at the interview.

2. Work experience. It can be hard to get work experience in your L6th, but persevere. Ask to shadow some engineers for a week or even a couple days. This shows interest and gives you something to talk about outside of your academic studies.

3. Write an EPQ or enter an out of school essay competition. Just taking part will show that you have an interest, and give you something to talk about.

4. When it comes to the interview, Extra Curricular stuff is irrelevant (but needed to get you to the interview). They want to see how you handle under pressure, and how you cope with different problems, not learn about your involvement in the drama society or the Lincolnshire Tiddlywinks Championship.

5. Don't crack under pressure. A lot of people get very flustered and forget the basics. Just be calm and composed. The interviewers do not want to trick you, they want to see if you have potential to be someone that they want to teach.

6. Don't be cocky, but be confident in what you are doing. Talk through your thought process when they answer the questions. They are not mind readers, and this allows them to see what you are doing.

7. Research your interviewer(s). If your interview has a PHD in pre-stressed concrete, then he is likely to ask something about that in the interview (trust me, I found out the hard way).

8. Try to enjoy the experience. It is a very competitive course to apply for, but even if you don't make it take away learning points from it. There are many great Eng courses in the UK, not just Cambridge.


I relation to the course, don't expect an easy ride. There is a reason it is the best Engineering course in teh world. But it is rewarding, and you do get time to do other things, such as sport, music and nights out in Cindies.

I can't sell, unless i downsize from one of the cheapest livable properties, in one of the cheapest areas in the country, without taking on massive unsecured debt. Any attempt to save up more capital, gets eaten by falling prices. 

&gt;If house prices fall, both renters and people who own a single house benefit. Rents are lower, and the price you can get from selling your current house is lower. But you always need some place to live, so the price gap between your current house and the next one you might move into is also smaller.

Once you're negative, falling prices make this gap larger not smaller.

&gt;Homeowners start with buying a house, and as their career improves, sell it and buy a better one. If house prices rise, the value of their current house increases, but so does the price of the next one, and the gap between their current and next house. They can't ever realise the value increase of their current house as profit, unless they are willing to move into a relatively cheaper one (which most people don't - they expect to move into better accommodation as they get older and start a family).

I'm now further from buying my second house, than i was when i bought my first. 

I see the need for more houses, for cheaper housing. I get it. It's certainly for the greater good. But I'm scared shitless of it. Because if decent houses become ""affordable"" my house becomes worth dirt. Yet I'll still owe the price of a new decent affordable place.

Being stuck here is fine while the interest rates are so low. (As long as I'm not needing to move for my career or something.) But if they bounce up, I'm on a shitty SVR, and being in negative equity, I'm stuck on it. I can't get a new fixed or capped deal, I can't get a new discount deal.

Cahill - Really filling in for John Terry. I'd like to see the Terry-Cahill CB duo back in action. 9/10

Luiz - Not a good game, doesn't seem to partner well with Cahill. He needs to get used to playing in the pivot with Mikel IMO. He's a great back up CB but he shouldn't be starting at CB against City... 5/10

Cole - I thought Ash played well today. He's always a threat on the left side and he's a valuable player. Our young LBs have big shoes to fill. 7/10

Ivanovic - Didn't seem to be in it today which really bums me out. It's as if some of our players have given up on this season and are just thinking about the next one. 4/10

Mikel - Great to have Mikel back. Can't believe he was subbed out. 7/10

Lampard - Had the chance to command the game and score number 200. I think we were all let down a bit when the penalty was saved, Frank included. Rafa is an idiot for subbing him out. 6/10

Mata - Not sure what was going on with Juan today, maybe he could hear the commentator on Fox Soccer pronouncing his name wrong and it was distracting him. I honestly don't know what to say, it's not that he was doing things wrong he just wasn't doing anything. I guess it just wasn't his game. 4/10

Ramires - What is going on with Rami lately? It seems like he thinks he NEEDS to get a yellow card early each game. Definitely becoming a liability. I think he needs some time on the bench. 5/10

Hazard - Our only attacker showing real promise today. Hazard lead the counters, got back on D and broke up the City attack, brought down long balls with control and showed real skill on the ball. The only thing he was lacking today was a goal. 9/10

Ba - He won the penalty which was great, his run on that play was phenomenal. He didn't see enough of the ball just like Torres usually doesn't see enough of the ball. The difference is Ba looked as if he got the ball in front of the net he was going to put it in. Looking forward to seeing Ba start more games in the future. 7/10

Oscar/Moses/Torres - I was so pissed with the subs and how the game was going at that point I don't even know what to say about them. I didn't see either of them having a huge impact (clearly.) I will say that Moses had some good runs though, he shows promise. ?/10

Rafa - Ruined my Sunday you FSW motherfucker. 0/10. I had to add another value (0) to my rating system here just to highlight how bad Rafa was today. Subbing a little earlier than usual, great. Subbing off Lamps and Hazard?? Are you kidding me? Even Rami ran right over to the side line to come off because he knew it was the right decision. The look on this face when he was told to get back on the pitch says it all. Then he subs off Mikel, moves Rami to play as the lone defensive midfielder and puts on Torres. I can't solely blame Rafa for the loss today but he certainly fucked up just about everything he could. What an idiot.

MOTM: Cahill/ Cech. 

Hazard should not have been subbed. It's crazy to sub him when Ramires was playing so bad... Moses looked uninspired, Mata looked tired and scared that they were so big. Not impressed with David Luiz or Oscar today. And Ba was invisible at times but that's probably bc we couldn't control the midfield. 

Seems to me Rafa doesn't like to sub or rest Mata. I thought Ramires/Mata/Lampard should have been subbed for Moses/Oscar/Torres.  

I don't buy in that subbing off Lampard is going to hurt his confidence other than a missed PK he too didn't do much and we need more youth when playing from behind.

I do think we will finish top 4. If we don't it will be a travesty. Some easier games coming up then we have a rough finish. But our strikers have to find the back of the net.

Let's say you owe the bank £X, the current value of your house is 100k, and you want to move into something ""20% nicer"" - or 120k. X is fixed and unrelated to the current value of your house, and does not matter in how much extra you have to pay to switch houses.

At the moment, you might have to pay 20k extra to move to a 20% nicer house. If house prices double to 200k for yours and 240k for the nicer one - you have become more richer on paper - *but if you want to switch to another house, you now need 40k extra.* And there is no way to benefit from the value increase, as if you sell the house, you always need to buy or rent a replacement.

If house prices halve, your house is now only worth 50k, but the nicer one is 60k - only 10k extra needed.

In all cases, you owe the bank X + a bit more for swapping to a nicer house. But as the price of *your* house grows, the price of the one you might buy next grows even more.

So, landlords default on mortgages and thousands tenants are made homeless (banks can issue section 8 at any time even if tenant in in term). House prices may drop but banks holding properties that they invested thousands in that are worth a lot less now. Every sale results in a loss...

In addition, banks loan to value for mortgages would go from 90℅ to a hell of a lot lower. If you think first time buyer finance is hard now image how hard it would be if houses lost their value and every bank is holding lots off housing stock.

Letting agents go out of business.
Individual landlords go bankrupt with their pension gone (landlords don't pay into a pension, they use their property investment instead). These are people not corporations.

Landlords are not evil, they put their savings into property. Like you do in the government when you put cash in an ISA. Except  a property investment is physical and logical investment of those afraid of stocks and shares.


The solution is not to penalise those that invest in property. Landlords want good investments, if you want to limit their (very small) market share then you make access to finance easier for all. If a landlord is in a bidding war against a FTB their is a point when their investment becomes intangible.

Granted he would do wonders in a 433 system, but you surely can't expect both the DMs to always stay put and not to make those runs. They have to be a part of the attack while making sure at least one is present to act as cover for the defense. And he is slow but he makes up for that by his range of passing.

Personally I'd leave it up to the local authorities to decide. 

As a side effect this would likely put some of the large national property developers out of business and replace them with a selection of small local builders. I regard that as a useful side effect as the large developers are too big and powerful. In fact I'd write into the legislation that none of them would be allowed to bid for the building work. Not that any of them would want to because there wouldn't be the sort of excessive margins they make with  their current business model.

In fact the collapse happened because of impossibly complex derivatives interdependancies and a catastrophic loss of inter-bank confidence. This is and always was a banking crisis, not a personal credit crisis. 

You make some good points but don't forget real wages have been stagnant for 30 years now. Many people were forced to borrow (at crippling interest rates) for monthly necessities. And that's before we even get into mushrooming mortgage debt, since housing costs have been shot into the stratosphere by massive credit expansion over the same period. 

The banks were happy to turn a blind eye and lend whilst they were making potloads of cash. They failed in a fundamental tenet of banking, namely risk management. 

You can accuse Labour of being complicit in all this. But the Tories if they were in charge over the same period would have done the same. At least we now have a few half decent hospitals and community centres!

I can sell my house for £100k. Pay off my 90K loan. I've got £10k left (which is equity i initially put down as my deposit), plus £2.5k I've saved up (either through repayments or actual savings but I'm trying to keep it a bit simple).

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; The opt out is only with regard to assembly, which by the by many parents probably don't know about or even know what religion is going on in the assembly. 

well if they have a problem with christianity or religion in general, and have anything about them, they will know about the opt out, or will be able to find out about it incredibly easily. 

&gt;  However! The religious aspect of an assembly is not always (never?) clear cut. Hymns can be here and there, there might be prayers before and after, there might be a reading in between notices or whatever.

well I'm sure a parent could specify their removal at any specific point of the assembly. 

&gt; If it is not an easy thing to do, if the child is - as many describe - made to sit outside and office on their own etc. then the school is not helping the situation.

yes, but the alternative is to change the entire setup of the school, of which most are clearly quite happy with, to make sure one or two kids don't feel 'isolated' or whatever. effectively the tyranny of the minority. 

&gt; In all those respects the school is effectively forcing a religion 

I don't see how this is forcing religion at all. If you go to a school in a country that is broadly christian with christian traditions, and a largely christian community that includes christian worship as part of the schools curriculum, you cannot expect them to abandon all of that because you do not agree with it. 

As you have the ability to opt out, that is all that is required to show there is no 'forcing' of anything.  

&gt; With respect to the ~1/3 of state schools that are faith oriented: very often the faith isn't confined to just the assembly area (as the law requires) but permeates numerous aspects of the school day and lessons thereby forcing a religion on a child.

There was a great article in the Guardian a few days ago where they pointed out that if you're a middle aged homeowner in work austerity is more of a vague concept. If, on the other hand, you're &lt;30, renting and looking to start a family you know exactly what austerity means.

The housing market seems to be held up artificially high so that baby-boomer landlords and home owners can cling onto their ""investments"". Everything possible should be done to decouple the housing market from being seen as a sensible place to invest cash. Because the problem is, even if there is now a flurry of new build homes - the people that will snatch them up are baby-boomers using their paid-off mortgage to raise the funds to buy a second or third home to rent! Young professionals won't get a look in, and will be stuck in the rental trap.

Right now it isn't the end of the world, but in 5-10 years time when these 20 year olds want to start raising families, I hate to think what rental conditions their kids will be growing up in. Worse than a council flat - for the children of hard working young professionals, saddled with debt and denied the comforts their parents enjoyed. 

A few things that could help turn this around would be;

* 1) A re-valuation of council tax, and those earning under say £20K don't pay it
* 2) A tax on the value of second homes to discourage amateur landlords
* 3) Landlords must sign up to a national register and poor practise could lead to them being 'struck-off'
* 4) A new ""rental bill"" to give tenants much more rights to complain, withold rent, modify their properties etc. After all, if you're paying mortgage prices in rent - you should get something to show for it... no more of this cap-in-hand ""please master, can I put up a shelf??"" 
* 5) Any new build should have a 6-12 month period where it can only be purchased by a first time buyer
* 6) It should be made temporarily illegal to buy a new-build as a second home (unless it's a self-build)
* 7) In the longer term, maybe new laws to buy up the crumbling post-war housing estates to rebuild proper modern communities with more housing. ",0,1361730046,null,0,false,0,c8kv6vb,t3_194le1,t1_c8kv6vb,t3_194le1,null,1431392729,25,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,25

If you employ someone then you can't just sack them if they start turning up late, throwing sickies &amp;/or thieving from the till. You need to give them multiple warnings, prove the allegations and take the risk that they'll sue you for some kind of unfair dismissal.

There are so many expenses and liabilities to employing someone I don't even know the half of them.

So this scheme allows the employer to establish a relationship with the potential employee, who gets to demonstrate their work ethic and that they're conscientious, and then hire them without taking that blind risk.

This is a tremendously valuable opportunity for small &amp; owner-operated businesses, and if it were done right there should be no accusations of ""taking advantage of the vulnerable for profit"". It absolutely should be about getting people into work.

Larger employers like Argos need this less than smaller businesses, because they can afford to pay a premium over minimum wage to employ new staff through temping agencies.

This is another way that new staff can be sacked without any risk, and I know Tesco have been doing this for decades - once an employee has proven themselves fast and reliable they pay the agency a finder's fee and take the worker on full time.

The problem with the temping agency model is that it's less likely get the most needy - i.e. the long term unemployed - into these positions. The benefits system has become unwieldy and inefficient and doesn't like to pay out very quickly, so the unemployed may not be able to take a risk on the offer of a day's work from a temping agency, as they'll lose housing benefit and have to wait weeks until their claim starts coming through again.

So a better solution would be to allow the unemployed to receive benefits through their first month of employment, and then pay them back over the course of the next year, &amp;/or permitting them (for example) upto 14 or 28 days work per year without penalty. This would allow them to prove themselves with temping agencies and employers.",0,1361734514,null,0,false,0,c8kwhc9,t3_194v1l,t1_c8kwhc9,t1_c8kvcez,null,1431393345,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Who knows what the defensive responsibilities of our players are? I certainly don't.

1) Interest-only mortgages are only profitable while house prices rise

Indeed. I'm actually on repayment, but my losses in value have probably outstripped what I've saved. I wouldn't know for sure, unless i get a revaluation.

&gt;2) The total amount you owe is proportional to house prices (if house prices double, your debt doubles)

Not sure what you're saying here.

&gt;3) Thanks to compounding interest, you pay less on a small short-term unsecured loan and a small long-term mortgage than if you have one large long-term mortgage.

Do you? (and by that I mean I'm not sure, not that you are wrong). The interest rate on a small unsecured loan is likely to be multiples of that of a secured long term one.

&gt;If house prices fall you will still take on less debt than if they rise, the only issue is getting a loan to upsize.

That's the thing, there's no indication that it does. The original OP spent four weeks stacking shelves, but seemingly got nothing from it but his/her laminated certificate.

Not at all. Voluntary work is...voluntary. That sounds obvious, I know. But it's about choice. You choose to do this voluntary work for, hopefully, somewhere you enjoy.
