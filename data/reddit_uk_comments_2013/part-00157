I'd be surprised if it was sent plain text, as back in 2008 they were fined for losing an unecrypted CD that had customer details on it. They wouldn't be the first company to fail to apply lessons learned from that kind of incident everywhere it was appropriate.

As far as passwords and the like go, the system isn't perfect, but they are making changes. The robot phone machine asks for certain characters from your account password now, so I don't think dots would fly now. It wouldn't surprise me if folk are being asked for the whole password later on either because the agent was making sure or wasn't paying attention or the system wasn't working properly that day. 

As for telephone password stuff, the most egregious example I can think of is one used by a telephone banking system - the security question is ""how many letters long is your mother's maiden name?"". Smith, Jones, Davis, Lewis, Scott, McKay, Patel, Singh, Mason, Brown, Sharp, Evans, White, Baker...

One problem is that most ISPs systems amount to ""wish it was two factor"" authentication. In the past I've been ""DPA verified"" by companies by quoting my own address or my date of birth, two bits of information pretty easily secured if my wallet gets lifted with my driving license in it. Passwords are basically fucked anyway - as Randall Munroe observed we've created a system where passwords are easy for machines to guess and hard for people to remember.

It's a very complex situation, but in a nutshell:
Sainsbury's are constructing 3 sides of the stadium (excluding the main stand, which it will look *really* stupid without) in return for the Roots Hall site, and we are paying for the rest (or most likely not, as the case may be) The problem is Sainbury's need to buy up some shops and flats around Roots Hall to make way for their supermarket and that's what's holding it all up. Then there are other problems with the council and constant winding up orders from HMRC (which Sainsbury's always end up bailing us out of), and these problems won't go away until we're in the new ground and we can sort out our cashflow issues: the club have all kinds of other revenue streams planned, including a casino underneath the stadium and a shopping centre.

and no one said you have to be gay to be a figure skater, they simply said that 'male figure skating is out' by which could have meant 'not winning a gold in that then' because the champion who would have probably won gold is gay was/is expected to boycott it...  
  
but this certainly isn't a hateful joke towards homosexual, if anything it's being inclusive of the gay community by acknowledging the often ignored participation of gay athletes - and yes, figure skating is known for being hugely camp, much like the theatre; if anything i'd say this joke is offensive to heterosexuals in the sport by ignoring the contributions they no doubt make (even some of the fashion designers are heterosexuial these days!) [i joke, i joke! sorry hetros!]  
  
it's kinda beside the point but i honestly can't even think of a single gay person i know that'd find this joke anything other than funny - and at least one of those people is an ice dancer! [which is different to figure skating because one has a technical points system and the other is simply fabulous for artistic sake]

If you loved seasons 1-4.5 the same way I did. Series 5+ will start of good (Eleventh Hour) but quickly lose their appeal through the mix of Moffat's 'LOOK AT THIS PLOT ELEMENT, SEE IT? EH? EH?' and 'OOOH. SUDDEN TWIST THAT HAS NEVER BEEN MENTIONED BEFORE. BET YOU DIDN'T EXPECT THAT? EH? EH? '.

Don't get me wrong, I think Matt Smith is fantastic and has done justice to the role, but the writing hasn't. 

Matt Smith's Doctor has been plagued by bland Mary sue characters (Amy) who don't develop at all and are plagued by 'fake' character development that doesn't exist aside from when it's a plot point (Case in point: Amy doesn't change in attitudes between 5.1 and 7.5) and reducing characters with genuine depth to a series of catchphrases (I wear X, X is cool, Geronimo, Hello Sweetie, Spoilers).

Whereas 1-4.5 went up and down between terribad (Love &amp; Monsters) and fantastic/unforgettable (Girl In The Fireplace/Waters Of Mars) with a bit of everything in between.

The entirety of Matt Smith's run bar about... 2 episodes? (Eleventh Hour, Doctors Wife) has been distinctly average or worse.

There are for example a lot of people who replied to that comment or it's children talking about how awesome an athlete Johnny Weir is - of course we have no way of knowing if they're part of the large and often unnoticed gay population on reddit or they're heterosexuals who enjoy figure skating without prejudice; this is my what i'm trying to demonstrate to you, you've zeroed in on something which could at worst be mildly problematic while totally ignoring the possibility it's written by someone who knows and loves the sport of figure skating who is simply stating a fact, and you've totally ignored any possibility they or the people replying to them and upvoting them could be gay or modern minded heterosexuals.  
  
Infact you've made assumption after assumption always picking the option which makes the poster the very worst sort of person - there is nothing at all which indicates the poster has any dislike of homosexuals or that they are anything but supportive and respectful towards the figure skating team; you could have assumed things in totally the other direction and come out with an entirely different opinion.  
  
i mean seriously read some of the replies to the comment you say is scaring homosexual, women and blacks away from reddit - it's full of people [some of them women, homosexual and who knows -maybe even black!] fawning over how flamboyantly fabulous this gay sporting icon is; and no it's not in the least bit homophobic to describe him in these terms because, and you can use youtube to verify this, it's very literally true.

There is more variation between Middlesborough and Liverpool than there is with Leeds and Exeter.

Also, Prime has Series 7 Part 1, but Netflix does not. The episodes are streaming rentals, unless you have Prime and a Roku box. Through a web browser, they're listed as free, but when accessed directly they're rentals. But through Roku, they're free. I suspect Amazon made an error and forgot to unlock them as free via web browsers.

Then we save the rest for next season when we'd be offering CL football.

Oh and now Caulker has left I'd be bringing in Toby Alderweireld.

Considering Soldado seems under control all ready, and we got 9m for Caulker, even after bringing in those players I think we'd still have over half that 100m left for next season.

Also lets keep in mind with all of this that we are Spurs, bizarre shit happens with us.

Just today we at one point we had a £26m transfer on hold because the agents wanted more money, additionally we sold a central defender only to have the deal for the replacement put on hold when the owner from Steaua called the deal off from jail......**he called off the deal from jail**....and that was just TODAY...that type of stuff only happens to us.

I am partially convinced that if we made this deal for Bale at £85m they would discover a forgotten line in the UK tax code and we would end up owing the UK government £90m and then Morata would get lost on the tube in London and mugged in Brixton and forever scarred and never reaching his potential.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;As far as I understand it, nobody is going to be banned from watching porn, it's just going to become opt-in instead of every household having access to it by default. 

One issue is that it isn't just porn that will be blocked. Cameron has praised a system used by TalkTalk that can also block things like social media for instance. One big and genuine concern I think is that ISPs will HAVE to use a filter, but the filters used will be at the ISPs discretion. What may be blocked won't necessarily be blocked on another ISP, for example. 

What if you live in a shared house, or what if you don't pay for broadband directly? (I.E., building broadband) 

There's also very real concerns that filters will be operated by private firms with no transparency in what is blocked.

&gt;Personally I think it makes far more sense having it opt-in because it protects families with children. There's no chance that your child will see something inappropriate on the internet because your household hasn't opted-in. 

You know what else protects families with children that is guaranteed to work 100%? Not allowing children to use the internet unsupervised. 

Just because ISPs will be mandated to have a porn filter **does not mean** that all porn will be blocked. There will be false positives, there will be sites that should be blocked but are not. The majority of web filters out there today are trivial to bypass. With having ISPs choose what filters they want to use, YMMV in regards to 'protecting the children'. 

There's also HUGE security concerns in mandating that ISPs have to enable filters by default. The TalkTalk filter for example *still logs all data whether it's enabled or not*. ",0,1375327597,null,0,false,0,cbejmtd,t3_1jfqfr,t1_cbejmtd,t1_cbehpqp,null,1429987073,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

What can I say, I love a kid with a shagfauxhawk from wales who plays left back and hits a lovely freekick and looks like donkey kong. But I can still love him on madrid. And he will leave at some point. If he leaves now spurs could reasonably receive coentrao and another player and still plenty of cash. Levy/baldini/avb can assemble some moves just before the deal is official and the side will be the strongest one I have been alive for. I love bale. I love spurs. There is no reason this has to change because of a transfer that is in both parties interest. Last year bale carried the side for a stretch, but that is not a good thing. I was ecstatic when he scored against lyon and west ham and wigan and sunderland and southampton all in the dying moments, but deep down I realized we finished fifth with superman playing for us. To be a consistent champions league team tottenham need to rely on depth and a full squadworth of class, not heroics. Heroics are what is needed to exceed expectations.

I feel it restricts our options in defence, and makes it much less likely to win the ball high up the pitch which is very powerful in the modern game (sturridge's goals against newcastle both from hendo/phil winning the ball high up). Not having this option makes it too easy for stoke to execute their game plan, in defence we're trying to keep them out rather than actively disrupt them.

As in my formation its not Lucas and Gerrard CM partnership that I don't like, its the idea that we can do without the advanced CM in front of them (hendo).

true,mekily,eccleston,Eccleston,"I wish I could recommend some classic Who moments, but I haven't seen enough to have much to recommend. But it would be really cool to include a clip from the very first episode ""An Unearthly Child.""

This one would do quite nicely:
&gt; IAN: Just let me get this straight. A thing that looks like a police box, standing in a junkyard, it can move anywhere in time and space?

&gt; SUSAN: Yes.

&gt; DOCTOR: Quite so.

&gt; IAN: But that's ridiculous. 

Definitely these two quotes from new series s1e1 ""Rose"":

&gt; DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor, by the way, what's your name?

&gt; ROSE: Rose.

&gt; DOCTOR: Nice to meet you, Rose -- run for your life!

and

&gt;  DOCTOR: Do you know like we were saying, about the earth revolving? It's like when you're a kid, the first time they tell you that the world is turning and you just can't quite believe it 'cause everything looks like it's standing still. I can feel it... the turn of the earth. The ground beneath our feet is spinning at a thousand miles an hour. The entire planet is hurtling around the sun at sixty seven thousand miles an hour. And I can feel it. We're falling through space, you and me, clinging to the skin of this tiny little world. And, if we let go... That's who I am

(That one is one of my all-time favorite Doctor Who quotes and the one that made me ""get"" the show. Love it. Maybe just use part of it, though -- it's kinda long.)

And a few more that I can think of...

* From s5e3 ""Victory of the Daleks"": ""YOU ARE MY ENEMY. I AM THE DOCTOR AND YOU ARE THE DALEKS."" Gotta have SOME good Dalek quotes in there.

* That scene in s7e9 ""Rings of Akhaten"" when the Doctor and Clara are walking out on that asteroid belt and looking at the light pyramid. It was just gorgeous.

* Also from ""Rings of Akhaten"": ""We don't walk away. But when we're holding onto something precious we run, run as fast as we can, and we don't stop running until we are out from under the shadow.""

1.  This was added to the history of The Doctor when Universal had control of Doctor Who, because adding the ""Human"" element of The Doctor to the proceedings, apparently, made Doctor Who more appealing to international markets.  However; we know from canon that the doctor was born and raised on Gallifrey.  For him to be human a human would have had to have travelled to and lived on Gallifrey a long time before the doctor came to earth. Therefore; if that was the case, the doctor would have human family or descendants on earth (presumably); and at some point in the past 50 years his compassionate side would have taken control and would have visited them.  

2.  It was the main point of the movie.

Hopefully players like Reach, L.Williams, Ben Gibson &amp; Smallwood can make the step up &amp; force their way into the team more regularly.

22 years ago, the top three were, in descending order, Arsenal, Liverpool, Crystal Palace.

8 years ago, Napoli were playing in Serie C. Last season they were runners up in Serie A, having not been out of the top 6 for several seasons.

We were the beast team in the world for 10 years. We are not anymore.

My point is, football changes season by season. We have a huge global fanbase, which City or Chelsea do not, and that brings in more revenue than a few thousand extra seats in the stadium. Man City and Chelsea are stupidly rich, but they are owned buy individuals who will, eventually, get bored and sell the clubs to somebody else who may not be so generous. Man Utd were lucky to have one of the best managers ever to have lived since the mid 80s, but he is gone now. Spurs, and ourselves, are teams who are rapidly improving, and we both have sufficient resources to build squads which can win the league.

 In our history, this barren spell is only matched by a period from 1923 to 1947 when we also failed to win a title.

Mine is a tiny store on the outskirts of town taking only a couple of mil a year. We're usually pretty empty so we take the time to do things properly. Whilst most of the sales staff don't come from anything like a technical background they'll typically come to myself or another techie colleague for anything they're not sure about, and the guys behind the customer service desk are brilliant. Most of the time they'll be on your side and fight your corner with head office and the repair agents if there's any nonsense, and again almost all of them are very technically literate. Only if you are an absolute ratbag and start shouting and screaming will they do their very least to help you, or more likely just ask you to get out, everyone else we'll try and help in earnest.

The larger stores don't have the luxury of time, though. Most sales are meant to be done in 15 minutes or so, which given the ludicrous number of things we are meant to cover in them is just not enough time for a decent experience. In a store like Bluewater or Lakeside, you will be quickly shown the door if you can't keep up with the brutal pace, because there are hundreds of applicants waiting (god knows why) for a crack at the job. The high job turnover and lack of team camaraderie means that most better people move on from the big stores as soon as possible, whilst they might be more likely to stay at grunt level and progress in a small one.

They want to create an environment where it's ok to be racist. In many parts of reddit, they've succeeded. That's frightening to me.

My instinct on the misogyny is that the majority of it is coming from young men who want to blame women for the fact that they don't have a girlfriend. The majority of them will grow up, meet women who defy their prejudices and change their opinions. Some of them won't, and they will espouse extreme views which is what /r/TheRedPill seems to be about. But they are a minority on reddit I would venture.

The racists, on the other hand, may never interact with someone non-white in a social way.

All this is not to suggest that misogyny on reddit is acceptable or even normal. That also horrifies me quite frequently. But it appears to me that there are more people willing to call out misogyny than racism. That's probably a bit of my own observer bias there!

To cover 18bn increase in defence spend (40% of 46bn), 8bn in cuts to combined NI/Income tax revenue (from combined 32% to 31%), 50bn from cutting employers contribution to NI (my estimate of half), 4bn to double number of prison spend. Means they are looking at finding 76bn through Welfare cuts, VAT raises, and corp tax raises.

Even if they halved welfare, by halving unemployment payments (saving 31bn) with their basic cash benefit, and halving social exclusion benefits to the especially vulnerable (including sending the buggers back or however they word it). They'd still need to raise another 40ish bn, from VAT and Corp tax.

That would be something like 25bn by raising VAT to 25%! and 15 bn from raising corp tax by 4% to 24% to small businesses, or 31% to large.

This is, of course, if none of those raises and cuts, affects economic output negatively.

Especially since Madrid have come in and blown what Tottenham expected in the way of a bid completely OUT of the water.

If he wasn't for sale like they stated, they would still be stating that in interviews and comments. The fact is shortly after this 85m bid was rumoured to be offered, those statements stopped. And were replaced with AVB saying more along the lines of ""he is a player we are willing to have"", ""we are counting on him"" and ""no comment"".

&gt; A required step in cheesemaking is separating the milk into solid curds and liquid whey. Usually this is done by acidifying (souring) the milk and adding rennet. The acidification can be accomplished directly by the addition of an acid like vinegar in a few cases (paneer, queso fresco), but usually starter bacteria are employed instead. These starter bacteria convert milk sugars into lactic acid. The same bacteria (and the enzymes they produce) also play a large role in the eventual flavor of aged cheeses. 

Now try to explain that in a simple argument!

And if you laugh of the concept of ""vegetarian cheese"", it's because traditional rennet enzymes comes from calves stomachs:

&gt; Natural calf rennet is extracted from the inner mucosa of the fourth stomach chamber (the abomasum) of slaughtered young, unweaned calves. These stomachs are a by-product of veal production.

People are so desperate to park here, and they often end up parking pretty stupidly e.g. at the end of roads on corners, or double parking so bad that it makes the street far too narrow for anything to pass down (and then people wonder why they end up with missing wing mirrors).

On the other hand, the parking isn't helped by students in the area having 3 or 4 cars to one flat. It is noticeably easier to park when they aren't around. However, on reflection I still think a RPZ would be a good thing - and I would be willing to pay to have the convenience of always being able to park near where I live.

true,norney,null,null,"It's probably quite a complex question that is best answered by an expert in psychology or sociology, but my view is that the problem is not with 'most people'. 

As you rightly point out most people can tell the difference between a cartoon, video game, joke or fantasy on one hand and actual real life on the other. The proof is in the pudding; most people are not violent and most people do not rape. Thus most people are not the problem, it's a minority who are the problem and who may well be susceptible to all sorts of forms of suggestion and perceptions of normality. 

This is veering further into speculation, but society as a whole does have something of a 'hive-mind' with a core set of values about what is acceptable and what is not. The Brits' innate knowledge of queueing is an example. 

Presumably that core set of values can be shifted slightly one way or another, resulting in significant changes in behaviour for some people. Anyway, as I said this is speculation but more to the point in this case there is a spectrum of what most people deem right and wrong, with most people's thoughts congregating somewhere around a mid point. Most people, but not all, would agree that holocaust jokes at a children's party are not appropriate. Similarly, rape jokes at a pub quiz make most people uncomfortable.

3. I don't know how important location really is. Big players moved to Monaco because they were paid more, the tax is lower and the weather's nice.

The area between Newcastle and Middlesbrough has enough empty space, places in the county of Redcar-in-Cleveland are pretty deserted too and there are actually places in the North-east that are full of inbred, 12 fingered mutants. Not that Lord Howell said all that but you'd think he had by looking at the reactions.

I'm not sure if I can consider myself a Northerner. Mancunian definitely but I've spent more time living away than living there. My experience of the North is that people are generally friendlier, less healthy, often (but not always) poorer. Same with North Wales (which to me is more like North England than South Wales).

The Westcountry is a bit like the North in some ways but sunnier and not as friendly to outsiders, but people from there don't see a massive divide between the grockles and the locals.

London's a separate country. I think many Northerners make the mistake of assuming it's either all like London or that London has any relationship to the state of the South of England (which if it does is really only in terms of commuter numbers and proximity).

People in the South and South East tend to be a bit more insular, but seem to have historically handled more immigrants.

I tend to find on trips to the North West that people I talk to are more openly racist, particularly against asians in their community. Same in the Westcountry.

true,squitchtweak,eng-westmidlands,Coventry,"1) Have you ever used an internet filter? They're shit. 

This filter will supposedly 'protect our children' by filtering out pornography and 'self harm and suicide websites'. I suspect it will also filter out sex education websites, as it will pick up on the 'explicit content' which they contain. It'll filter various other harmless things too. 'Suicide websites' are almost all websites dedicated to support and prevention of suicides, which are again immensely valuable.
And some porn will ALWAYS get through. No filter is perfect.

2) Learning to get around the filters may also lead kids onto more 'hidden' parts of the internet where they could find genuinely awful stuff such as child pornography.

3) This whole thing reeks of hypocrisy.

 I mentioned the sex ed websites? They're valuable because school sex ed really isn't that great, and parents can opt to take their children out of school sex education. But Cameron doesn't care about that. He also doesn't back the No More Page 3 campaign. I don't know about you, but for me and most people I know, the first porn we ever saw was when we were in primary school and saw a picture of a woman with her tits out presented as somehow an acceptable feature of a newspaper.

4) What else is going to be blocked? First porn, now 'self harm and suicide websites'. Many people see this as a gateway to genuine censorship of the internet.

5) It encourages irresponsible parenting. Any parent can easily put a filter on their internet already - they're widely offered by ISPs. You're often asked about them when you set up internet. This encourages a someone-else-will-do-it-for-me attitude.

&gt; Stéphane Mbia is almost certainly the individual with most to prove, having shown disdain for the club with a series of ill-advised tweets, and given away the free kick that essentially relegated the Rs against Wigan Athletic.

Unless I'm mistaken, [this was Mbia after the Villa loss](http://imgur.com/23KWYRV). I think the guy was given an unnecessarily rough ride following the Twitter debacle, although he was guilty of claiming someone else had used his account, probably in panic response to the hysteria. One of the more cantankerous IndyRs lot even accused him of scamming the supporters with his giving-his-shirt-to-kids routine.

In other words there will always be a special case who gets hit harder in some fashion - or on the flip side enjoys a greater benefit. 

A good example of this would be stories run by newspapers about families who are housed in expensive homes with lavish commodities ([example](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1309201/95k-year-benefits-family-12-homed-1k-week-house.html)). 

In an ideal world we'd see a case by case examination of what is appropriate for every family in every situation - I'd be all for that - so that nobody is given more or less than they need in support. Those claiming unfairly large benefit packages would be curbed and disabled young girls would have a *reasonable* level of financial support. 

But as I said - it's the job of the media to cherry-pick these cases in order to sell their stories. The public doesn't want to read about ""average house temporarily on benefits receives correct amounts and can afford to buy the food they need"" - they want to read ""family of 12 receive hundreds of thousands to buy brand new consoles whilst doing no work"" or ""8 year old disabled girl left homeless after government cuts"".

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; These trolls are going to ruin the internet for everyone. Women shouldn't have to put up with this and if preventing future incidents means removing our right to anonymity online it is going to happen.

In the mind of a troll the hoards of mainstream people who now inhabit the internet and get offended by text are the ones who've already ruined the internet.

People have been insulting other people online since the early 90's but it's only since things like MySpace popped up and your mum started using it that it's been a complained about issue because your mum doesn't really understand how it works, why anonymity is useful and why the internet doesn't quite work the same way a public park does.

Speaking on anonymity, a big part of the reason people get trolled is because they *aren't anonymous*. It used to be you didn't tell anyone fucking anything on the internet, you were a pseudonym and nothing else because you knew that once that information is out there you've lost all control and it can be used against you.

Now though people get online and the first thing they do is fill out their public Facebook profile with their full name, address, friends, pictures, interests, current emotional state.. all sorts. They make themselves massive targets and the effect the troll *should* have is to make that person have another think about how much of their private life they want to share on what is essentially a broadcast technology.",0,1375353656,null,0,false,0,cbepbu6,t3_1jg4br,t1_cbepbu6,t1_cbebh9h,null,1429984416,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

- The man who took my cancellation on the phone was a *bastard*. I am pretty damn polite on the phone and this guy was trying to annoy me.

- They fucked up keeping my phone number, so I had to get a new one. Because I'm self-employed, that also incurred lots of business costs.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"That's interesting, but I think there a big difference between an actual *partisan* voter and in an *independent* (or non-partisan) voter who's opinions and vote patterns happen to follow the partisan one's.

**A *partisan* voter is one who will vote based on the party loyalty.**

**An *independent* voter is one who will vote based only on policy, regardless of party.**

Parties were at some point formed, and gained power by grouping a large number of people with similar opinions, so it makes sense for an independent voter to share the majority of the same opinions as one of the parties.

Over time, if the party policy continues to align with the independent voter's, then the independent voter's vote pattern will be remarkably similar to a party loyal voter's.

The difference is when party policy changes, or a new party appears that more closely aligns with the independent voter's opinions. Then they will happily vote for someone outside of the party, whereas a partisan voter will continue voting the same party.

In a FPTP voting system like ours and the US, it is difficult for an independent voter to ""split"" from the party like this, because there are only 2 or 3 parties big enough to have a chance at ""winning"" the big elections.

The prevalence of tactical voting in FPTP means that it is extremely difficult for a new party to compete against the established ones. So an independent voter has to make the difficult decision between voting for the party he/she *really* prefers, which could be very small and powerless, or voting for the main party that he/she dislikes the least.

As you can imagine, the first option makes the independent voter feel like he/she is ""wasting"" his/her vote, so he/she normally chooses the second option.

I feel like I am one example of this. I definitely have a liberal bias (it is impossible for anyone to have no bias at all, this would mean they would have to have no opinion either), but I don't consider myself to be partisan or party-loyal. I'm sure you can guess which party I historically have voted for, but it has mostly been to try and keep another party out of power (didn't turn out so well).

I don't have any loyalty whatsoever to the party, and in recent years (especially since the party I normally vote for has lost all credibility to me) I have decided to say, ""fuck off"" to tactical voting, and now I vote purely based on policy, meaning that I have voted for a different party candidate almost every time.

Whether they choose to go fully independent and dismiss tactical voting is up to every individual voter, but **I don't think it's right for you to dismiss the majority of independent voters as simply being too dumb to realise that they're partisan when it's the system itself that forces them to act like partisans.**

EDIT: Just to be clear, I'm talking about voting partisanship, not personal bias. Everyone has personal bias based on their needs, knowledge and experiences. Our biases differ because we all have different needs, knowledge and experiences. Anyone claiming to be completely unbiased cannot be, unless they literally are aware of *all* needs, and possess *all* knowledge and experiences.",0,1375355704,null,0,1375355921,0,cbepm3l,t3_1jf4wj,t1_cbepm3l,t1_cbe5gri,null,1429984283,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Gilligan may have one some ""brilliant"" investigative journalism, but it seem that ran dry the moment he had to leave the BBC, not to mention getting himself embroiled in things like sock=puppets and online bullying. 

Have a look at these:

* **Virgin Media** (60mbps, Fibre, inner city location - £30ish a month). Started off all rosy and joy, then VERY quickly I notice speeds dropped from around 50mbps down to single figures (often less than one at peak times). I was able to get money off, but they took 3 months to solve the problem and customer service was AWFUL.

* **BSkyB/Sky Broadband** (10mbps down in a rural area, £5/month extra to Sky TV). For a rural area (outskirts of Birmingham), I get a pretty shoddy connection. I average about 4/5 down and around 1 up. Mostly due to the distance to the exchange. Pretty decent customer service, though they tend to redirect you to BT pretty often.

* **BT Infinity** (75 down, £50 includes TV free evening &amp; weekend landline phone calls, inner city location) The **best** service I've ever had from any ISP. The internet is screamingly fast. Their customer service is okay. AND you get free BT Sports channels.

If it was me I would try and avoid the larger housing estates. Although there is some nice ones they still have their gangs of kids like anywhere else.

There is also the village of Muff or Bridge end. Both are in Donegal but sit right on the border, about 10/15 minutes drive from the city. Muff itself has seen a large growth of Derry people move there. Although Bridge end has a few houses its mainly built up with petrol stations.

* Alessandra - One of my favourite players we have signed, brilliant pre-season. Good pace and passing rate.

Continuing the theme -

Wind Farms: Expensive, inconsistent, produce proportionally less power. To reduce bills you have to look at less desirable forms of energy generation.

Inconvenient Truth: Its a propaganda film with inaccuracies and (*with a statement that will piss everyone off*) presents human induced climate change as an indisputable fact, which it is not, the situation is lot more complicated and murky. I'm a little surprised to see this on a manifesto, it seems just petty and trivial. I do believe, however, schools should teach critical thinking and scientific method rather than an absolute when dealing with such topics, allowing people to examine the evidence with sufficient tools and come to their own conclusions.

IPCC: Are they actually needed? They don't do research themselves and I'm not sure what value they add to the understanding of potential climate change that isn't widely available elsewhere. Additionally you cannot ignore the controversy and falsification of climate change data to support assumptions (even if you agree with the final conclusion), that is then presented by the organisation. This has been one of my biggest problems with the climate change debate, data has been faked and insults thrown at anyone who questions the conclusions, making it very difficult to have an informed opinion.


All in all, I'm not a supporter of UKIP, they have raised some interesting ideas though that should not be dismissed so quickly.

I have little problem with evolution being taught to school children although I would be wary of teaching it to young children, evolution itself underneath the surface is quite a complex subject and as such could easily confuse young children as they enquire into the subject by natural curiosity, but certainly it is a subject which could easily be taught from primary six onwards at an age at which children are capable of forming opinions and theories of the world.

There is much needed to bring town centres back to a healthy mix of chains and independent shops:

- councils should stop opening out of town centres
- councils should reduce parking costs as much as possible
- councils should re-assess business rates
- councils should charge more rates to big chains and subsidise smaller businesses
- councils should stop gigantic supermarkets opening all the time

Once it's placed underground it is clearly in a much condensed state wheras before it's extracted it is diffused. I guess that if you could entirely recreate the conditions that the waste was in before extraction, you'd have a point. Is the waste not a different material, anyway, from that which was extracted. It has been processed, after all. 

The difference between a wind turbine and nuclear is not some abstracts statistic about whether or not a turbine can fall on your head. It is that a wind turbine is at worst going to end up a rusting hulk and a hazard that could be theoretically avoided. The hazard presented by unattended nuclear waste is completely different unless you are trying to argue that the radioactive material used is not, in fact, hazardous. 

The reality is that with all these supposed measures, there are any plants around the world that are considered extremely unsafe. The waste is not protected against power failure, natural catastrophes or military attacks. The Fukushima Daichi plant's waste pool teeters on the brink of collapse and radiation is leaking into the sea. With the process of civilisation collapsing around us, it is easy to imagine that in a few hundred years there will be no one with the energy supply, the expertise or the tools to decommission abandoned nuclear plants. Believe it or not the world will go on after you die and the life forms that are here in the future should not be put at risk in order to satisfy our greed for energy.

true,Komajippi,NO,norway,"&gt;In the United Kingdom, football clubs sometimes choose to enter administration when they are unable to pay off outstanding debts. Under the Insolvency Act 1986, a business will face a winding-up order bringing them to court and if it is shown that a business cannot pay debts as they fall due or cannot repay outstanding debts then the company will be classified as insolvent. **Administration puts accountants ""in charge of pretty much everything apart from coaching the players and picking the team""**. For a football club in administration, the ""football creditors rule"" requires football-related debts such as wages owed to players and staff, and transfer fees owed to other clubs to be paid first.

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_\(British_football\)). It seems like the clubs can also receive a penalty (e.g. less points).

If you're going to try and make the argument that someone is an Islamophobe then don't make the first link a retraction (about a convicted pedophile) and the second link a petty attack to their working for PressTV.   As a rule Iranians don't hire Islamophobes.  

The third link is a very tenuous press release with a charity commission saying a school accused of teaching extremist political beliefs *no longer* had any links, that the headteacher had now left a certain party and another trustee had left - so there's certainly no smoke without fire, only that they'd now put their affairs in order.   

The fourth link is speculation about an online anonymous commentator who one journalist thinks might be Gilligan because of his love for Boris.  Relevance?  Clueless.  

Seriously, you might want to stop bandying the term 'Islamophobe' about if that's all you have.  He spent some time investigating one particular mosque, that doesn't make anyone Islamophobic.

We need a young CB to replace Caulker.  I think it would be beneficial if we got rid of livermore, THudd, parker, good mid-table club players, but wont get enough time and don't really fit the system.  That being said, i still think we need an anchor man to rotate in for Sandro.  Yes i know we have Dembele and Paulinho, but they dont naturally play an anchor position like the one used in AVBs 4-3-3.  If we could get another squad player to rotate in with Sandro, we would be golden.  Parker lacks the pace and the attacking prowess to adequately play that position, and he doesnt play well anywhere else.  Maybe keep livermore and get one more from the money of THudd and Parker.

We also need to figure out LB.  We have two very good supporting wingbacks, but lack anyone with the defensive work-rate to support such a high backline as we have played.

true,threesquares,null,null,"This is, quite honestly, a bit of a hard question to answer. The class system permeates absolutely *everything* that exists over here, and almost any activity you do references which class you come from. 

Knowing what is lower class or upper class is pretty much instinct to us as Brits - I know that the Sun newspaper is for lower and lower-middle class people, and the Times and Telegraph tends to be read by upper middle folk. Having a messy Land Rover is actually more upperclass than anything else (how else would you drive around your estates?), while having a squeaky clean brand new BMW probably makes you pretty middle class nowadays. If you're rich you shop at Waitrose, or a high end local deli. If you're not, it's Morrisons and Asda for you. 

I know that Americans talk plenty about their class system, but I don't really think it's that much like ours. Like you said, American class is based very much on money and how much cash you have spare - ours is more about family lines. You can live in a piddling little bungalow but still be the toff on your street just by how you talk, where you were educated and what papers you read. In the same vein you can live in the biggest, flashiest mansion in town and still just be lower class wannabees. It's actually quite hard to move between classes. I can go to as many horse trial days as I like and wear Barbour jackets until the cows come home, but if I'm not in the right circles I'm not moving anywhere. 

Personally I think my family is pretty middle class, maybe edging upper middle. I have a close friend who is *very* much upper class, however, and whenever I'm around her friends I'm reminded of exactly how *not* upper class I am.

Adults know the highway code, most drive. If they choose to break the rules of the road it has little to do with their understanding of the HC, and everything to do with the persons attitude.

Likewise drivers who speed, use their phone, tailgate, park on double yellows, use the bus lane are not clueless either.

In fact its possible that if it reduces government debt by a few billion pounds, the money we save on debt on that interest could be more than we earn in dividends/increase in share values.  
However, I agree that should be looked at, not a forgone conclusion. 
 

2) if the government has a vested interest in a company like Lloyds, it can be a bit awkward politically to legislate in that area, people can accuse you of favouring a company etc.

Even if you join a supporters group, you do get access to priority tickets, but you still need loyalty points to take advantage of it, unfortunately.

Viagogo is pretty viable from what I know (never used it).  If you go that route, you still need membership to buy tickets on viagogo, but loyalty points do not matter.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"Big, big error in the calculations here. We have actually added to the wage bill already over last season.

All we have really done is removed Carragher's wage of £90k per week and half of Reina's wage of £110k a week, while adding around £200k per week in new signings (not including Sturridge and Coutinho). It also doesn't take into account that we are still paying half of Reina's wages, and that Gerrard and Suarez both got big new deals. 

You can't count Carroll since we weren't paying his wage last year. Net-net we have increased the wage bill, so far.

The big year was last two offseasons, when we got rid of Maxi, Acquillani, Carroll, et al. that was almost £30M off the wage bill, and I have written about that extensively in comments here. 

FSG is all about utilization based on wages. The theory of moneyball on transfer fees is somewhat misplaced - wages make up a much more important component of cost. You have to measure a players output based on the wage they are being paid. Last offseason and the one before using this theory it was possible to predict with 100% accuracy which players Liverpool was going to sell or remove (even at free transfer fees). That group was Kuyt, Carroll, Acquilani, et al.

The new type of contract structure has four tiers, anybody that doesn't fit into these you can consider being on the transfer list or actively being shopped:

a) First team international / world-class players. on £100k+ per week - Gerrard, Suarez, Johnson and formerly Reina

b) First team players - £60-70k per week - Sturridge, Lucas, Agger, Toure, Enrique, Mignolet. These guys are on the team sheet for matches (so guys like Downing, Skrtel and Henderson don't fit - they are on the same wages but aren't starting team)

c) Squad players - £25-40k per week. This is the new ""joe allen type"" signing. The old regime had these guys on £60-80k per week. This is where Henderson, Downing and Skrtel *should be*. We sign most players in this bracket and then push them up to the b) bracket when or if they work out. 

d) Prospects - £5k-15k per week.

You lower wage risk by immediately moving on players. You minimize transfer risk by purchasing young players who have resale value. Simple, but effective. 

The main headline of this story is wrong though, the big cost saving and restructuring windows were the last 2 years. We now have the new structure and are filling it in with the £30M+ saves, so from here the wage bill increases and is being filled in again. 

You can immediately see who is likely transfer listed: Skrtel, Downing, Spearing, Assaidi, Henderson etc.

This is also why we didn't need to sell Shelvey, his wages were ok and he could have been loaned. 

One positive, I think it is great that fans are becoming more aware of player wages as a factor in decisions.

We still dont fully know.

I think there was a lot going on behind the scenes last season between players &amp; management etc
Some players fell foul of the manager, some simply didnt perform.
Injuries didnt help with Woodgate in &amp; out, the defence was never settled &amp; leaked goals like a sieve.
Rhys Williams got injured early in the season, Bikey was hot and cold.

Up front Scott Mcdonald didnt play most of the season after falling out with the manager, Emnes our top scorer the previous season just didnt turn up, Juke was injured at the start &amp; never really got going.
Muzzy Carayol our most threatening looking player was injured most of the season too.
We simply strugged to find a regular goalscorer.


The manager constanly changing teams &amp; tactics to suit the opposition didnt help us either.
I dont think we played the same team two games in a row.

Shocker of a season.

You are so wrong. Every day, maybe 10% of car drivers don't overtake me correctly, on occasion Ill have a driver pass me at speed with literally mm to spare. That has nothing todo with my compatibly as a cyclists, that's bad driving that is a genuine danger to my life. Me being a good or bad cyclists has no part to play in that....And its stuff like that, as well as people occasionally yelling at you (""get a car you knob!"" ect) make people feel in danger.

The difference is ""seasonal cyclists"" are new to this, and seasoned cyclists just learn to live with it, and (some) get aggressive as assertive as a result.

Suarez came to play with Torres originally - that shows the pull these players have for others. If we are struggling to sign big players now, imagine how hard it would be when they know our best player has just left?

And the Coutinho is a world class player, will make the difference etc. argument doesn't fly. He's a kid. Unreal player yes, but only a cog in the total system. Suarez is *the* cog.

By paying some other country to do your dirty work for you! What's the point of any sort of human right protecting people from the government if this behaviour is permitted?

Edit: I asked Noam Chomsky about what he thinks and this is what he had to say;

&gt;One can go further.  The US NSA itself carries out surveillance of citizens that violates the clear wording of the foruth amendment.  That’s quite normal.  There are three versions of law: (1) what the words say, (2) what the courts decide, (3) what the government does.  All three often differ.  Take, say, the UN Charter. According to the US Constitution, it is the Supreme Law of Land, including its fundamental provision (Art 2.4) banning The threat or use of force in international affairs.  Virtually every official comment about Iran threatens the use of force (“all options are open”).  If this came to the courts, they’d dismiss it as a political question.  The same is true on all sorts of issues.  Take the 5th and 14th Amendments, which say that no person shall be deprived of rights without due process.  “Person” has never meant person, back to Magna Carta.  Today, for example, it includes fictitious legal entities established and protected by the state (corporations) but not undocumented aliens.  At the time of the founding of the country it didn’t include slaves or even women (who are property, under British common law, taken over by the Founders), or of course the indigenous population.

&gt;So it continues.  Law might be subject to the comment attributed to Gandhi when asked about western civilization: “It might be a good idea.”

If we keep hold of Luis it's really only going to be because Madrid don't come for him. And that Mourinho/Roman decides not to pay over the odds. 

I'm not sure Mourinho wouldn't just accept not getting Rooney and go with it from there.

That's what he's said publicly and he's a pretty straightforward bloke so I don't know if we should be too worried about a push from them. I think that's just media looking to keep a cold rumor hot.

Also don't see Arsenal coming in with enough money.

Either way, Suarez isn't going to be a Liverpool player past this season, as I see it.

There are cycles of players being bought and sold. A few players become the marquee signings of the market, their values inflate, and then everybody moves on. Cavani, Falcao, Bale, Gotze, etc, this summer. 

This means next summer there has to be that marquee signing everyone will go for. My money is on it being Luis. So a ton of foreign teams will come in for him. Whether we have CL or not, he'll move on to someone bigger, better, etc.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's a bit strange to base an argument on absolutist demands for 100% certainty, which never happen in the real world. But in fact, we could flip that around. The death penalty could very well save lives, because it guarantees the criminal won't kill anyone afterwards. By *not* having the death penalty, it means that innocent people will be killed.

As a first counter point, the government does other things that have a statistical chance of killing innocent people. It can go to war, construct a bridge, approve a medical procedure, cut the welfare budget, or tolerate sales of alcohol and tobacco.

Most people seem to be willing to stomach the occasional civilian being killed if we, say, intervene in an African genocide, so we should be willing to tolerate a very occasional (probably much less frequent) miscarriage of justice for a rarely exercised death penalty. Opposing the death penalty on these grounds is inconsistent with the way we value life for other policies. 

Second, we already have the possibility that innocent people are locked up for their entire lives. Just because the prisoner is alive for another 40 years is no guarantee that a wrongful sentence will eventually be exonerated. 

Miscarriages of justice can happen no matter what the punishment is. So your argument's really based on an assumption the death penalty is vastly worse than imprisonment. But if this is true, why shouldn't the state have the flexibility to inflict the death penalty if the criminal has done something really awful? (Such as, say, leading the country into a criminal war...)

Third, as you say, people who are sentenced to death will try absolutely anything they can to get out of being killed. They'll hope to spend the rest of their lives in jail rather than die.

Our captain is basically crying out for real investment in the first team to make us competitive.

true,Angry-Australian,lfc50,,"Do you play Fifa games from launch? Fifa 13 was certainly very buggy. Pretty much anyone who played a Career mode for a season would have their save corrupted permanently in the initial versions of the game (and was still common for some people after that). This is one of the major modes of the game, completely broken. The online servers would crash with a daily frequency (e.g. no online, no UT, no Live features) at random times of day, sometimes at peak. There was a common bug that would cause the ball to be invisible, both online or offline. These are glitches or shortcomings in the game not by design. But then there are the design flaws.

The goalkeepers (watching the ball go past before they react), or the **fucking irritating** ""momentum"" engine which causes your defenders to suddenly lose 2 yards of pace, mis-time the tackle so they get completely removed from the situation, and attackers who stop their run as soon as you place a through ball.

The problem isn't that the software has bugs or isn't perfect, every game has bugs and flaws. The problem is EA, the software giant and mammoth of the gaming industry it is, and their attitude to a) improving the game a substantial amount between $60+ editions, b) patching the game in a timely manner (if at all) when mode/game breaking bugs are common, c) listening to player feedback and addressing faults in the gameplay of their titles (aka giving a shit about their userbase) and maybe most importantly of all, d) not doing anything about some of these issues for years straight spanning multiple $60+ editions.

These things can be looked over or forgiven if it was a smaller developer, a niche series or a series generally not breaking sales records. EA and FIFA are none of these things and FIFA makes a monumental amount of money for EA every year. The code isn't being rewritten every year and the developers have 12 months to improve on their code and get more done per edition, but that doesn't happen.

I know this has turned into a huge rant but I have to get this off my chest whenever the annual FIFA hype machine rolls into town. Because it's the same every year.

You don't know how this works? Little steps. Nobody wants a fascist state, nobody wants that. But we start marginalising people, imprisoning them for no strong reason. Or perhaps we get a new boogey man we have to unite the country against. In Greece at the moment, they have such things, and part of their society is turning towards extreme nationalism, maybe fascism.

Fascism is the end result of a lot of baby steps that nobody thought would matter, then along comes a set of twists of history to make it happen.

If there are any lessons we need to learn from history it is to be alert to the tiny steps that lead to mankind's worst moments. Marginalising the weak is always a good start, take their benefits, force them to the margins, hate them. When they turn to begging and crime to live, you are not far from interning them in labour camps, ""for their own good.""

Why? Out of town shopping centres reflect consumer demand.

&gt; councils should reduce parking costs as much as possible

Parking costs merely reflect the council getting good value for an asset they own. Car drivers are subsidised enough already.

&gt; councils should re-assess business rates

Land taxes are the fairest and least distorting taxes. Reducing them would move the burden to income and sales taxes. Why should average workers pay more to subsidise landlords? Anyway, almost all of any decrease would taken up by increase in rent.

&gt; councils should charge more rates to big chains and subsidise smaller businesses

Why? What's better about small businesses?

&gt; councils should stop gigantic supermarkets opening all the time

true,thejayarr,,Southend United,"We've signed a few players, all of whom are varying degrees of uninspiring. The situation hasn't been helped by the transfer embargo we've been under for about 4 months now, which limits us to only 20 players (we currently have 19).

John White's come straight in as captain, I imagine he'll be useful, at best. Will Atkinson's come in from Bradford and has been completely anonymous in pre-season, which apparently is basically what he was like at his old club. Ben Coker signed early on, and it's difficult to see him being any good at all.

We've actually had three players sign today - Craig Reid from Aldershot, who I predict will do absolutely sod all, Julian Bennett, who will probably be pretty good and Conor Clifford, who I imagine will be solid enough.

We cleared out some dead wood, but not enough. Chris Barker's still around as he played enough games last season for an automatic contract extension. He just can't do it at this level anymore, though, so hopefully someone will take him off our hands. The likes of John Spicer and Michael Spillane were swiftly shown the door, to everyone's relief.

We lost a lot of goals from the team in Gavin Tomlin and Britt Assombalonga (and Ryan Cresswell, who got about 8 from defence last year), and I don't think we've replaced that at all. We also lost Sean Clohessy, who was our most consistent player over the last three years, which kinda sucks. He hasn't even signed for anyone yet, weirdly. Oh, and Mohsni finally fucked off, which is great news.

Someone who's running their own business wants someone with initiative - if a customer phones to complain, you want them to offer to look into it, arrange collection of the faulty part, ship out a replacement immediately, find out what needs doing to smooth the situation over and inform the guys on production that there might be a quality control problem.

If you have a formerly enthusiastic employee who says, ""fuck it, it's twenty to five and I'm surfing reddit"", then the replacement part doesn't get shipped out for another day and the customer's more pissed off. 

Proving the job isn't being done requires that the job is fully documented, and this favours corporates who can employ business process designers and the like.

I'm not advocating in agreement with Shapps, by the way. I don't know the full story and I tend to favour worker rights, anyway. The current two year probationary period should be enough.

BT Engineer came out to try and fix why my internet is so slow, guys on the phone said I'll be charged £99 if it's a problem on my end.

First engineer came out, said it's a problem on their end and that I won't be charged but he tried to do the best he could according to the terms of ""home improvement"" callout. He says give it a few weeks and it should clear itself up.

Obviously it doesn't, mind you i'm getting around 400 kb/s download around this point and 27 kb/s upload. Slightly frustated, we contact BT again and they send out another engineer.

The engineers have been nice blokes, I probably just caught them on a good day or something. Anyway, second engineer is saying to me that he doesn't know what the problem is and is going on about how the wiring probably wasn't installed correctly when the house was built etc etc and say I shouldn't be charged.

The internet speeds up to about 7 mb/s down and upload stays the same, but about 2 weeks after hes gone it drops down to 200 kb/s download again and we get the new bill through the door with +£99 in the ""how we worked out your bill"" part of the letter.

Anyway I'm on the phone to management and they say that the engineers aren't there to fix your issues they are there to ""fulfill the home improvement package"" and that I'm still going to get charged even though they didn't do jack shit (even made my connection worse and made the socket in the wall look like a second-hand job).

So i'm sitting at home now, connection speed is about 50 kb/s down and even if we call for another engineer to come out we will just get charged another £99 and they aren't liable to even fix it.

Also between a rock and a hard place currently, because of our financial situation.

Football clubs are a passion where wealthy owners invest their own money, without ever expecting a return. There are a few exceptions, though few and far between.

Being 17 has nothing to do with your problem. It is because;

* 1) This is a crap time to get a job anywhere what with the recession

* 2) Summer is a particularly bad time to get a retail job as most people are off on holiday and shops are quiet. Most will start recruiting heavily for Christmas towards October time. These are usually on temp contracts but a lot will keep you on afterwards if you're good.

If you want a job I suggest:

* 1) Try everywhere, low end jobs don't have any room for being picky.  Later in life when you get career jobs in your mid-late 20s then you can start to get a bit more choosy.

* 2) Don't just look at retail - call centres, healthcare jobs etc. also have minimum wage entry jobs for the &amp;lt;18s and tend to recruit all year round.

It's selling the shares for the same reason it doesn't borrow large sums of money from bond traders and invest in the stock market. In both cases, the government is preferring to own (or not owe) fixed interest securities and not own large numbers of shares in a single bank, which they probably see as rather more risky.

There are also political reason to sell (Conservatives eschew public ownership of the means of production) and there may be issues with European law and state aid. But I think the most basic reason is that there's no real reason to invest a large sum of money in an asset that's rather risky in the short term.

That being said, some of the figures are way off. How could Spearing be on £60k a week? Nobody would believe that. He signed a [new contract](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/13312069) after being in the first team for just over a month. How would that warrant him being on bigger wages than Lucas and Meireles were at the time? I know we've made bad decisions, but this is not believable. Every other source has Spearing on around £20k, think about it he is a homegrown, hard working Scouser who is always talking about how lucky he is to be at the club there is no way he would even ask for £60k.

Most people agree Downing is on £80k. Johnson £80k or £90k. Seems to inflate some players wages to make a point, which isn't necessary.

I feel some fans are afraid we are being left behind and that is why they want a big signings. Spurs look odds on to finish fourth, they have finally some depth on the wing, an excellent midfielder to replace Parker/Livermore (who are quite bad) and finally a 20 goal a season striker. Even if they lose Bale they are in an excellent position. If they do finish in the Champions League, and strenghten further. What if those revenues lead to them building the new stadium that has held them back? How are we ever going to catch them when it seems their project is 2 years ahead of ours? We need to bridge that gap.

Even Arsenal are close to paying off the stadium debt, so their finances look wonderful. There is an obvious sign that we are being left behind, and every year we are not in the Champions League digs us deeper into that hole. That is why some fans are impatient. Chelsea, United and City are clearly stronger and will be for the foreseeable future (5-10 years).

true,MrBushido2318,eu,European Union,"After many years of ""up to 8mb"" my exchange got upgraded and I ordered BT infinity! A week later grumpy engineer with a bad attitude shows up to set up my connection, I ignore his discourtesy since the harbinger of faster internets may treat me however he wants.

Giddy with excitement I sit down and run speed test, 72mb download. To put this in context, if I had previously wanted to download a big named game off of steam it would take the best part of 8 hours, it now takes 8 minutes. But wait, there's a catch, every 30-60 minutes the connection would be lost.

So I contact BT's subsidiary in India, aka technical support. Oddly enough I have no complaints about this stage, while there was a small language barrier to overcome they appeared to solve the issue quite quickly and within a couple of days my net was working flawlessly.

Or at least I thought, the gods of superfast internets were to prove themselves fickle once again. The other day when we had our first rainfall since I received infinity, my connection started dropping again to the point where ""You have been disconnected from chat with customer support"" was more frequent than their questions and replies. They phoned me up and said and engineer will be looking at the exchange side of things to fix the problem, however I'm still not completely sure they appreciate what the problem is.

Kelly has to stay at RB, especially now after Robinson went on loan.  Without Kelly we have no capable back up at fullback--none.  And Kelly provides backup for both RB and LB since GJ can play on the left if needed.

Wisdom seems to be set to be added to the rotation at CB this year, but he also has to be a back up RB given Kelly's awful injury record.  Even at CB that leaves Agger, Toure, Wisdom, and Coates as our 4 CBs--which is widely the number earmarked for minimum number of first team CBs.  Are you comfortable with Coates getting a number of appearances at CB or Jon Flanagan asked to play in BR's system as RB in a substantial number of games?  I'm not really even comfortable with Toure being the starting partner to Agger, but it seems like our best option.

I love Wisdom and Kelly (especially Kelly--his start against Lyon under Rafa is one of my favorite LFC moments), but it is just not wise to only rely on Wisdom and Coates for backup CBs.  Skrtel is very important to us at least for depth.  And It's great to assume Kelly will become a star CB for the club, but the fact remains that he has not even made *one single appearance for the first team at CB*.

I see injuries at CB and CDM being the most worrisome to our chances. I feel certain we'll bring in another CB if we let Skrtel go. I don't know if Rodgers feels fine with Allen technically being the backup CDM. If he does than its on him. 

Otherwise we have a number of wingers, we have a number of forwards, we have a number of CMs (if Coutinho is our only true creative CAM), and we have depth in defense.

true,Variola13,,EtOH,"I asked my train crank, he emailed me an article that explains it. 

""We’ve all seen the hapless Tube newbies (“Tubies”, as they shall henceforth be called) hammering away at the ‘Open’ button on a train, blissfully unaware that the doors will open when the driver bloody well wants them to, and no sooner.

But why do so many Tube lines have these redundant buttons?

Ride on the Northern, Jubilee or Central line, and you’ll see the buttons beside every door. On some lines, they even light up when the train pulls into a station, inviting the busy passenger to press away in futile rage. But on every Underground train, the doors are operated by the driver. Yet the existence of the buttons suggests that, at some point, passengers were expected to open the doors themselves. Why aren’t we trusted to do so any more?

The reason is speed of entry and exit. In the 1990s Tube bosses realised that dwell time at stations would be reduced if the doors were opened by the driver, rather than waiting for passengers to press the button. The problem was more acute on the Central line, which is unique on the Underground in having both an ‘open’ and ‘close’ button. There were stories of malicious ne’er-do-wells closing the doors on people, and an incident at Notting Hill Gate in which a young boy was injured in a door closed by another passenger. These issues, plus the desire to have a standardised system across the entire network, led to the decline of the passenger-operated doors in the late 1990s.

The D78 stock District line trains used to have buttons, and when the trains were introduced the idea was for the doors to be manually operated by passengers at every station. But the lack of ventilation meant that in summer trains were getting unreasonably hot, so in the warmer months the driver would operate the doors. This arrangement lasted until the late 1990s, when the seasonal switch back to passenger operation simply never happened. The buttons inside the carriages were removed during a mid-2000s refurb (the buttons on the outside of the train are covered up by a panel).

Nowadays, while the DLR and Overground trains have buttons, few Underground lines do. But things are changing: the S-series stock, currently serving the Metropolitan and Hammersmith &amp; City but scheduled to cover the District and Circle lines too by 2015, are all fitted with door buttons. While the driver normally controls the doors, when the trains sit for extended periods at a station the practice is to close the door but allow passengers to open it by pressing the button, thus keeping the cool / warm air inside the train.

So that’s the real story behind the buttons. For the rest of us, though, they’ll continue to be a handy way of identifying tourists and newcomers to the city.""

true,KaoticKarma,lfc12,,"ITT: People who know nothing about Diego Costa.

Liverpool is my second favorite club at the end of the day behind Atletico Madrid, and I can tell you all one thing for sure, Diego Costa at the moment is turning into one of the most deadly strikers in Europe.

During the 2011/12 season, I would probably agree with a lot of you saying he's just *alright* and wouldn't probably ever cut it in the PL. But under Simeones' tenure, Costa has been transformed into the striker all Atletico fans wanted him to be when we bought him from Vallaloid in 2010.

After a very successful loan spell with Rayo Vallecano in the 2011/12 season where he scored 10 goals and gave 4 assists in only 16 matches, Simeone knew at the very start of his time at Atleti that this young Brazilian was going to have a shout in his team. 

Very technical, good on the dribble, wonderful pace, good strength, and having quite the eye for goal made Costa our first choice striker for the second half of the 12/13 season when Falcaos' form started to dip combined with a few injuries keeping him out of the first team. Costa can play on the wings quite proficiently, slowly but surely though he has made that CF position all his own. He was an integral part of our Copa Del Ray win this year over Real Madrid, notching 7 goals and 2 assists en route to the final as well as scoring in the final itself. Overall throughout the season, in which he was only a starter for the second half, he scored 20 goals and gave 15 assists.

Diego Costa only received this reputation of being a ""hot head"" in the last year. He has been very misunderstood, and the hivemind in /r/soccer just kind of took off after the first RM v Atleti derby match of the 12/13 season when Costa was locking horns with Ramos all game. People can say what they will about him, but Costa is a very self aware professional and came out in an interview earlier this year saying that he is a ""provocateur"" and that is how Diego Simeone wanted him to play. Drawing the fouls, getting the opposition all riled up so that they would be more prone to make mistakes. He's quite the intelligent footballer for only being 24 years old.

[Here's a video of his exploits from this last season](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvll_n4wWDs). To me, he would be quite the pick up for Pool. As well, depending on how he does this season, he might be more realistic of a target for Pool in the January window, or even next summer. From what I've seen so far in our three friendly matches this summer, Costa isn't looking a shadow of his former self, he's looking twice the player he was last season and all of us at Atletico have very high hopes for him.

**TL;DR**
**He's definitely misunderstood, and a bit of a diamond in the rough. Would be a fantastic addition to Liverpool's top 4 ambitions as he has all the makings of a top class striker/winger in years to come.**",0,1375382742,null,0,1375383778,0,cbeyiv0,t3_1jhy04,t1_cbeyiv0,t3_1jhy04,null,1429979989,33,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,33

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"...No shit?  Where did I say Robinson was covering RB?  He was our only backup fullback of any kind beyond Kelly, who you'd prefer to move to CB.  Not to mention that relying on Kelly for meaningful backup--at two positions, no less--is very unwise given his awful injury record.

So you'd have us only have Agger, Toure, Kelly, Wisdom, and Coates at CB?  Does that sound like a CL-quality defensive squad?  Sure doesn't to me.  Wisdom did make a few appearances as a CB last season, by the way, but exclusively in a 3-man defense.

It would actually only take two injuries, of any duration, to get to Coates at CB.  If Agger or Toure went down then Wisdom would, presumably, step in and then Coates would become a backup.  Or, Kelly will do a season-long like he has and Flanagan would become a backup RB.

One of my points, that you clearly missed, is that relying on one player to backup multiple positions by himself is extremely foolish.  If that ne player goes down, like Kelly (did I mention he's injury-prone?), then you lose a host of backup.

&gt; If bale moves on that fee, he MUST produce big or he will be the biggest flop ever. If he doesn’t contend for Player of the Year in La Liga EVERY YEAR then he is screwed... to me that would be way too much pressure.. But then again that’s a shit ton of money for my bank account too...

true,yourealwaysbe,null,null,"This looks like a slightly crazy route to me :)  You're taking a large detour to avoid central London, only to drop on to the crazy busy Bow Road at the end.  Safety-wise, i'd be looking to avoid the flyover/roundabout at Bow rather than central London.
In fact, the detour seems to avoid The City in particular, which is pretty dead at the weekends (people only go there for work), but instead passes through some of the busier roads in places where there's fun to be had.

I've [uploaded](http://geo.gillcouto.com/uploads/51fab668d8/route-1.html) a route here.  It's the route i would take (and have travelled often during the week and weekends (i think it's a lot quieter on the weekend) -- but then maybe i'm a foolhardy London commuter) up until the turn off on Mile End Road.  Personally i would just continue along Bow Road, not take the flyover, but navigate the roundabout (carefully).  However, on the map i plotted a detour along a national cycle route and some cycle paths (i haven't been through that area, so playing it safe :) ).  The detour will be slow, but hey, you'll hopefully avoid a massive traffic jam on Bow Road.

It also gets a bit complicated at Tower Hill, this is both to avoid bumping into the start of the Ride London course (you might have to walk a bit), and because the bit of road it avoids isn't so fun.  I always take the detour through the back streets (mostly a marked cycle route, but you have to stop at every junction to figure out where the next bit goes (it's not easy the first time)).

As for ploughing straight through central London: the City is generally ok during the weekend (but the roads are still potholed to hell :) ).",0,1375385623,null,0,1375386973,0,cbezozd,t3_1jf6lq,t1_cbezozd,t1_cbep9ri,null,1429979443,1,false,londoncycling,t5_2wcdj,1

Car drivers are a very large group of people (if not a majority), so why shouldn't councils work in their interest and in the interest of business owners (that pay council business rates) to get people into shops?

Otherwise they'll just drive to the out of town stores with free parking. Few people can be bothered with the fuss and expense of public transport when they have a car and can just hop in and go.

My council is part of today's news story about profiteering from parking. Many of their car parks already charge reasonably sensible rates. If they are still making a load of money then there's scope for other councils to do the same.

In this particular case I really really wish I hadn't read the detailed account that the BBC covered or seen his school photo, and I'm not naive about the types of absolute scum out there and I've led an interesting life. Speaking to police officers and child protection people over the years I realise that sitting at home you really can't imagine what nasty things people will do, you think you can, but in reality you really can't.

The Philpots are wicked and dumb, the Hazels suffer from some kind of depravity and all too often addiction leads parents to be so useless they cause harm. In this case the mother was helping to organise beatings, drownings, physical torture along with starvation over many months for one sibling whilst looking after the other perfectly well. This couple are in the absolute evil (and I would rarely use this term) category, and out of the many many cases of abuse they are in the top tier.

This case goes beyond the nastiness that is typical child protection. I really can't convey, and nor do the reports what effort these people went to in order to do this and what the screams would have been like in that house and how they broke a 4 year old. The happiest day of his life was when he went into a coma.

So, the reason why I disagree with you is that this child suffered every single day, and was dieing in front of professionals. 5 days a week he attended that school and was reduced to eating out of bins in front of staff, they saw him do it. He had the physical signs of the most horrendous injuries and starvation and nothing was done, not even a half decent attempt at intervention.

If this couple had been beating their dog, they wouldn't have gotten away with it for so long.

As someone who's mainly concerned with cyber-criminals this is very reassuring as if GCHQ can't crack it, I bet no-one else can (save maybe NSA, but with the lack of any leaks to the contrary and given the level of co-operation between GCHQ and the NSA, even this seems unlikely).

But... and it's a bit but:  BUT!  It goes on to say: 

&gt;  Papers said GCHQ was now capable of ""attacking"" hundreds of apps, and a ""mobile capability map"" from June last year stated the agency had found ways of looking at the search patterns, emails and conversations on many commonly used phone services.

Just look how much games they won last season with only Bale scoring. They also would fight for 3rd or 4th. 10+ points behind us.

...but if they don't sell Bale I can't say they won't fight for the title. They may still have not the squad like us or City but they also don't have CL to play and can rest players in EL.  Bale alone won them quite every match in the last 10 rounds of last season and they strengthend their starting XI enorm with Paulinho and Soldado and have still quite a few interesting prospects like Holtby or Sigurdsson.

I wouldn't really be afraid of a Spurs with Bale, but their team looks dangerous and we'd have to take them seriously.

Yes.

Working. 

&gt;How do you feel about the class system?

Apathetic towards it. Its there, its not going away. While im sure its great to be in the upper class, im not going to lose any sleep from it. 

&gt;Do you still make the distinction between our class system and the Americans' one, which I think is based on wealth?

Not really. Both are really just about education. If you can get your child into a public school and then oxbridge he/she is pretty much guaranteed to move into the middle class. Im sure its the same in america, put your child  in a private school, then to one of their Ivy league schools. Connections may play a slightly larger role in the UK but i dont think its massively so.

If it came down to it, I could see Sturridge getting the nod early on just due to familiarity, with Costa becoming a more regular starter when he gets comfortable (though I could also see Costa playing alongside Sturridge, and possibly rounding out the top 3 with Suarez back since he's another of those players than can play all the roles up front).

First, i'd walk past trafalgar square: it's a chaotic mess just there.  Then, the turning just before the strand actually requires you to cross the pavement (it's a cycle path, but terribly placed, so make sure the pedestrians see you before crossing).  You then go up a slight hill past Covent Garden.  The difficulty here is mainly tourists and taxis, but no-one's going anywhere fast so just take it slow.  Once you turn off Great Queen Street it's calm again.

Shortly after Great Queen Street you'll have to walk for a short spell when you come to a road that's closed due to works.  (Only a few meters.)

After that it's pretty relaxed to Regents Canal, then it's a mix of the google route and the detour i posted earlier.  I haven't been down the stretch from Calthorpe Street to the canal, but the area is quiet and backstreety, plus it has cycle paths, so you should be good.

Also, his reason for wanting to protect earth is obvious in the show. Initially, his granddaughter goes to a school there, and he dislikes humans. After her teachers barge in, he realises humans cannot learn about the TARDIS from them and leaves earth (this was before he could pilot the TARDIS, mechanical faults, so trips were random at best). The reason he begins to like earth is that he's forced to respect and starts to even admire the tenacity and intelligence of both teachers. To me, it'd be worse to have him part human. Which sounds more appealing: a random alien who happens on this blue ball and starts to appreciate the people living on it, so much so that he dedicates himself to defending it until eventually his respect is so deep he declares that the planet is under his own protection, the small planet is under the personal protection of an alien who has toppled galactic empires, broken the laws of time and space and even battled with beings that have the powers of Gods; or that he has been protecting this world because he's part human and not because of the innate ability and personality of the people on it.

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"Haha you are a special kind of excitable.

The whole point of my original post is that Kelly is not a quality CB sub and Wisdom's true quality at CB, while better than Kelly's, is far from known considering he hasn't gotten even one  senior appearance in a back 4 as CB.  Further, I think there's a substantial step down from Kelly to Wisdom, let alone from GJ to Wisdom.  Wisdom and Kelly are not CL-quality CBs, not yet.

How lacking we are in top defensive talent is apparent when you compare our defensive squad to the 4 clubs who finished in CL spots last year in the EPL.  Our starting back 4 is probably as good as anyone's, but beyond them we have serious issues.  United (Jones, Smalling, Buttner), City (Richards, Lescott, Kolarov), Chelsea (Cahill, Azpilicueta, Bertrand, though they are more flexible and could have even better players on their bench), and Arsenal (Vermaelen, Jenkinson, Gibbs, this is assuming /r/gunners is a good barometer of most fans' opinions of Vermaelen) all have better defensive reserves than Liverpool without Skrtel, who have Kelly, Wisdom, and Coates, perhaps with the odd exception (Buttner is about as good as Wisdom, I'd say, for instance).

The players listed for each of the clubs above also have far, far more appearances for their clubs than Kelly, Wisdom, and Coates have for Liverpool--101 for United, 330 for City, 90 for CFC, and 180 for AFC, compared to **only 52 appearances** for Liverpool.

My point is that Wisdom, Kelly, and Coates as our back-up defenders, at this point, is not going to be good enough to challenge for CL.  Look at what happened with Skrtel in BR's system--he made mistakes.  Imagine two people thrust into CB who have never played there before in a back 4.

Numbers of injuries necessary to incur Coates's presence aside, I think it's safe to say I don't ""have a serious reading comprehension problem,"" and instead just disagree with you.  The horror!

He is neither intelligent nor does he have a good footballing instinct.  

His first touch is embarrassing for a professional footballer.  He plays with his back to goal and plays negative passes.  For a player his size, he is terribly weak and he has bad balance.  For his size he is also not a great header of the ball precisely because he does not get in good positions on the field.  Confidence will fix some of his issues (decisiveness above all) but not the important ones.  

Negredo on the other hand, is a fantastic addition.  He actually has some serious pace on the first few steps which is surprising and is incredibly strong (as seen multiple times in pre-season).  He also has very good balance.  He is a better header of the ball than Dzeko because he gets in very good positions on the field.  

The pace of Negredo, Aguero and Navas will win us a trophy; not the goal scoring of Edin Dzeko.  ",0,1375389911,null,0,1375390106,0,cbf1irk,t3_1jiee7,t1_cbf1irk,t1_cbf1b0g,null,1429978590,0,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,0

He seems to have all the capabilities Rodgers is looking for in the top 3. He can be interchanged, has good movement, and can both score and setup teammates. His mentality, although it could get him in trouble, is also what we're looking for. As Rodgers has said many times, we're looking for players who can help us punch above our weight.

I also think there is something essential about having a Brazilian contingent through the middle. After a while teams can get down to just playing football, but initially and long term the benefits of having Lucas feeding to Coutinho feeding to Costa could be huge.

true,DrWooWoo,null,null,"Apologies for attaching this to your comment - this is something I have been thinking about, and seeing the word ""fag"" here set me off, as I recently had my first experience of being called one.

I am a fairly private person, and probably the last person to want to rub my sexuality in anyone's face. I am not ashamed of being gay, but at the same time I do not feel it defines me in any other way than my partner happening to be male. I have no interest in fashion, musicals or fake baking myself, and the thought of spending an afternoon shopping fills me with dread.

This past Saturday was my sister's wedding, and whilst the whole day was amazing, just one little word managed to tarnish it. We have a large group of family friends - some that I am very close to, others that I am less close to but still see at pretty much every family event we have. The particular family friend involved happens to be the husband of my mum's hairdresser - a burly rugby type, happens to think he is hilarious, although I have never really spoken to him enough to be bothered by him. As is the case at weddings (especially when it is one where you know practically everyone) you tend to spend a good half an hour just trying to get to the bar due to bumping into people you haven't seen for a while. I had just happened to make it back from the bar and was walking alone down the hall back to the dance floor when said ""family friend"" walks past me and says under his breath ""fag"" - not to me, just out loud. I did a bit of a double-take, I think I may even have awkwardly laughed, and he turned round and said ""Oh, hi DrWooWoo"" and carried on walking - no smile, nothing to indicate he was joking. Even if he was joking, I really don't know him well enough for it to be funny.

I spent a good part of the rest of the evening trying to play it down in my mind - I can take a joke, and if he had said anything else I probably would have just passed it off as him being drunk (which, funnily enough, he wasn't). And then it hit me, the reason that I was upset about it was not because he had an issue with me being gay, it was that in his eyes, I am not DrWooWoo, who happens to be slightly eccentric, who enjoys hiking, who probably has an unhealthy obsession with his cats, who plays piano and sings badly in the shower, who would kick your ass at Mario Kart 64 and who could drink Southern Comfort until stupid o'clock in the morning whilst playing the accordion he accidentally bought whilst drunk - no, in his eyes I am DrWooWoo, who is gay. Nothing else. And in a funny way, it makes me a happier person knowing that whilst people like him walk around with their narrow view, missing all the good in people, that I am nothing like him.

Soldado is rumoured 60k, Paulinho will be less than that and Chadli less again. Some fringe players like Dempsey/Huddlestone/Livermore/Parker/Gomes will probably be shifted this window freeing up more wage space. Also, if Turkish club Besiktas are allowed to play in Europe they have confirmed they will sign Adebayor, freeing up 70k-100k a week.

Yeah, I guess I should've clarified that I meant ""young, potentially world-class CB,"" in the vein of Papadopolous or Alderweireld, and instead I wrote ""promising,"" which could open the door to Kelly and Wisdom.

I think Kelly could become a world-class player, I really do.  But he isn't now, and we have no idea how good he'd be at CB.  He is a good RB already, but we just don't know about his skill at CB.  We know a bit more about Wisdom there, but I honestly don't see him as more of a good squad player for club.  I don't really support signing Ilori, for instance, for the reasons you listed.

I just have a problem with *loaning* Skrtel out when a player of his quality is exactly what we need in the defensive rotation.  I'd feel much better about if it was like Reina and we had a replacement here already.  But we don't, not an established one anyway, and I can't supporter losing Skrtel without at least getting transfer money to use to get a replacement.

Yeah, I've been lurking on /r/gunners the past couple of weeks to get some kicks out of their Suarez coverage and saw most people saying that they think Gibbs and Jenkinson will both become great players.  Of course, they also said Mertesacker and Koscielny is their best CB pairing, so it's tough to say how good of a sample /r/gunners is of all supporters.

* Yeah, opinion, however it is true that they don't stand a chance of being elected.

* This isn't Cameron's fault though, he is just omitting reforming the expenses.

* Let's not speculate!

* Private systems don't rip people off as such and I think they are a lot better at specialised care than the NHS. There is a reason £800000000 of the NHS' budget goes on compensation claims! That said, it would be a tragedy to lose the NHS.

* If we force wealthy investors away from the country by imposing taxes they will just take their business elsewhere. This happened during the 70s with many of the country's celebrities such as Bowie and Bolan. It's better to have them pay a little than none at all. The lowest classes are the least likely to move and also the lest likely to vote, they are an easy target (but, of course, not a fair one!).

* Abstaining from a vote is more neutral than the people in the link makes it out to be. The votes mentioned aren't that recent and the issue is contentious amongst Conservative MPs and voters.


* The bedroom tax seems reasonable and only affects 660000 people - which is 31% of the working-age benefits claimants. 

* Like I said, the rich will still find a way out of tax, the poor are stuck with it.

* After a bit of Googling, I've learnt that it isn't really a ban but just new restrictions and guidelines stating what can/can't be packed. I think this is important due to the rising levels of childhood obesity in the UK, and the fact that many children aren't being exposed to a balanced diet.

* I haven't payed enough attention to them to argue against that.

So from what I've seen so far this summer, in addition to his already great vision and passing, he can play high possession very well. Try looking up some of the highlights vs Numancia in which he scored a double, or versus Sporting Cristal last night where he was making some wonderful runs and had some great passes. He also is always trying to put pressure on a defender, he's less like Falcao in that respect. Costa generally is running around the pitch all game long. As far as lost balls goes, I wouldn't say he's always losing the ball in possession but when he does he tends to track back.

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"Trying to address these in order...

1. If we work on £85m as a rough transfer fee, the only deduction from that I know of is the 'training fee' awarded to Southampton, 5% of the transfer value. Bale did have a 20% sell on clause in his transfer to Spurs but when Southampton were desperate for cash they sold this for a one-off fee of £3m plus a youth Goalkeeper, who amounted to nothing. I'd run with 5% as being roughly the total so Spurs would see £80m coming in

2. I think you'd have to expect them to splash some more cash after a Bale sale, the fans will be anxious and he is a quality player so some placation is probably necessary. How much of it they will spend is another issue, I'm sure players will suddenly increase in price once newly-flush Spurs come calling. That may be why they have done significant business already, if they anticipated the sale. I can't speculate as to whether they would go for a marquee signing or a few cheaper players to add to squad depth

3. Spurs are already very wealthy, in theory. Joe Lewis is worth £4 Billion or so, though he doesn't lavish funds on Spurs. Their big issue is a lack of Champions League football, so you either miss out on the top tier of players who deem it mandatory or you overpay in wages to convince them to come. The other option is to buy players who are willing to take on the challenge or players from that lower tier who can't get regular playing time at a Champions League club. Spurs have a tight wage structure and this is one of the main reasons I think selling Bale is a sensible decision. To keep him they may need to up his wage to £120-150k a week, twice what their next top earner would be on. This distortion of the wage structure could cost them a lot of money in the long term as players demand bigger deals with the knowledge that they will pay to keep their best talents

4. I don't like him personally, but his quality cannot be doubted. He was keeping Spurs in the race for 4th when they probably would have slipped back a lot further had he not been taking games on by himself. Similar to RvP leaving Arsenal in a way, it's hard but not impossible to replace the goals but that's not everything. Bale and RvP both scored goals out of nothing, where lesser players would not have been able to. How many points Bale is worth is a complex calculation, he certainly will be a massive loss. It's all well and good having a stronger squad but in the toughest games, it's essentially the quality of the respective XIs that will determine the result

5. Napoli have Champions League football and a lot of cash after selling Lavezzi and Cavani in consecutive seasons. I wouldn't classify Higuain as the same league as Cavani and really Napoli overpaid for a lesser player. Of course, they still have nearly €30m left over after 'replacing' Cavani but we shall see how capable Higuain is in a new league. Not sure who the wingers of Bale's quality are, really. He's not as good as Messi or Ronaldo in that position but he is some way ahead of almost everybody else. The lack of CL and a tight wage structure will hamper bringing in an elite player, they may need to go for younger prospects who have yet to prove themselves and want to do it at Spurs

6. I guess I've already responded to most of this. I don't think Spurs can finish top Four without Bale, unless they really broke tradition and went balls out in the remaining few weeks of the window. I think Arsenal will eventually strengthen, United will undoubtedly sign a big player or two (while losing Rooney) and City have already made their mark with several big money signings. Chelsea's biggest addition is Mourinho, but a number of returning loanees, Schurrle and probably Rooney make us a lot stronger than last season. It seems the incumbent top Four have all moved ahead, the question remains as to whether Spurs will do enough to usurp Arsenal. I can't imagine them breaking in to the automatic CL places but Arsenal's form can be unpredictable so I'd leave it to them to fight it out for the qualifying position

It seems our only real targets are Rooney, possibly De Rossi, neither of which I could see going to Spurs so in this instance their new clout won't affect us too much, but it's bad news for Arsenal and Liverpool. As JoseNotMou mentioned, the new stadium will cost them a lot and we may see them stockpile most of this cash to reduce the future debt burden and avoid an Arsenal situation of prolonged financial pressure due to financing arrangements

In conclusion, I hate to see a player of such quality leave the league but for a few reasons, I think Spurs would be mad not to sell him for €100m",0,1375393986,null,0,false,0,cbf355s,t3_1jii44,t1_cbf355s,t3_1jii44,null,1429977834,8,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,8

1) Physical and well-built second striker who prefers to roam/play wide (and deep). Very hard to mark due to ""rough"" playing style/agility

2) Extremely ""intense""/all action in his playing style, won't have any problems holding his own in the PL

3) Rather ""unpolished"" and raw, not the most tactically disciplined. Needs space and license to roam in order to fully prosper

4) Consequently not a superb finisher or typical 20 goal a season man (though decent goal scoring record the past two seasons)

5) Prone to the odd ""antics"" on the pitch, not to everybody's taste but personally I do like him very much. Strong mentality, a fighter

6) As for the price: hard to judge in a highly inflated market. £20M seems to be minimum for a forward from a major league top club...

7) Soldado (Spurs) &amp; Negredo (Man City) more ""talented"" &amp; prolific, but Diego Costa's mentality/playing style may even be more suited to PL

He combines with whoever he partners on the left brilliantly, and makes a lot of nice overlapping runs. He's a great crosser, and takes some wicked set-pieces. With age, Cole seems to have lost a lot of his offensive game and at the moment to two just don't compare.

true,Chanceee,num11-away,,"It's a ridiculous rumor that has been created via twitter. Clint is just one year removed off his career year of 2011-12 and is still a good (great in American terms) player. MLS is a fine league but Clint is still too good of a player for it and that doesn't even factor in that no team could afford what he wants for wages. Also Dempsey has been critical of MLS in the past due to the regulations on where a player has to go via allocation lottery (plus MLS blocked his move to Charlton back in the day, he wasn't happy). Dempsey is simply a squad player now for Spurs and personally I wouldn't mind if he moved to a team that is more mid-table if it allows him to play week in and week out but a return to MLS is nothing but malarky. 

TL;DR

That return to MLS rumor was manufactured by twitter and it won't happen. He makes too much money and still has 3ish years left to play in Europe.

    Not everyone was on board. 'This is a sea change in the way that the government interacts with the general public,' Mary Ellen Callahan, chief privacy officer of the Department of Homeland Security, argued in the meeting, according to people familiar with the discussions. 

    A week later, the attorney general signed the changes into effect. . . .

Now, NCTC [National Counterterrorism Center] can copy entire government databases--flight records, casino-employee lists, the names of Americans hosting foreign-exchange students and many others. The agency has new authority to keep data about innocent U.S. citizens for up to five years, and to analyze it for suspicious patterns of behavior. Previously, both were prohibited. Data about Americans 'reasonably believed to constitute terrorism information' may be permanently retained.

    The changes also allow databases of U.S. civilian information to be given to foreign governments for analysis of their own. In effect, U.S. and foreign governments would be using the information to look for clues that people might commit future crimes. . . .""

Some channel where the sponsors are more brave. It might not have the following of something like those duck hunters or alien chasers, but it would be very loyal. I also think that making the general ignorance portion longer would be good for an American version. Quick ass kickings with the pay off of conversational fodder would be loved I suspect.

The American woman who would be best to host a show like this would be, without a doubt in my mind, Ms. Beatrice Arthur. She would be perfection with a panel of the typical American comedians. She was hilarious and could quiet a room with a look. Shoot, just her picture makes me sit up straighter. I cannot imagine a better host for an American version. And since she passed away in 2009. I am content to never see an American version made. 

That may change, but I would cringe big time if it were done poorly.

Edited to remove the word ""upon"". I dislike that word.
Edited again because I was curious and digging around. Katey Sagal might be another option. Not as perfect as Bea but for the American audience likely to enjoy the show, she would be familiar, funny and lovable.

true,obligatory-taco,,Carrickfergus,"I rescued my pup from 7th heaven. No charge but they do a home check to make everything is safe (ie not a puppy farm or bait for dog fighting or being left outside). They are excellent and work with local pounds too. They don't charge anything for the rehoming but you might not get an 8 week old puppy. but they do have younger dogs that need forever homes. And an older dog might be better. 

I'd recommend waiting for the baby to arrive and let your dog bond with it first. If the dog is part of the family it won't feel neglected. It will realise it's just another member of the pack and will feel like it has to help keep this new baby safe. Dogs are smart and nurturing creatures. Just make sure it knows that the baby comes first. Even though it's small, it's order in the family is still higher than the dog. 

Having a new dog enter its life and then a new baby could cause issues over dominance, aggression and possession. If the two dogs don't have a full trust for each other, your dog may see the new one as a threat to baby and could lead to fights. Which would be impossible to break up while carrying a baby. 

I also have to add I have two siberian huskies and they are amazing with kids. As a breed they are great family dogs and have a sixth sense with kids. I'll admit they are buggers to train though because they are so damn smart. If they realise there isn't enough in it for them they'll stop doing tricks etc but they are hard work when it comes to grooming and having chunks of fur everywhere may not be great for a new baby. you may have heard stories about them but that's only because people are breeding them for a quick buck and they are ending up tied up in gardens and neglected.

true,matcht,lfc12,,"He played wide at Ajax before 2010, when he moved to the centre after Huntelaar left he had that 47 goal season where he announced himself as a world class talent. Dutch football is very different, and Ajax's domination of that league means we can't compare how he'd fare in a similar role for us very accurately. Besides that, why on earth would you move your biggest talent from his best and favoured position? He is happiest playing from the centre, because he can roam and link play wherever he likes (prescribing to what you're saying about interchangeability). 

I understand rigidly defined roles for attackers is almost obsolete, but defined defensive roles for attackers are almost more important now than ever. Suarez is not going to be chasing the left back towards his own goal, and neither should he be. He needs as much freedom as we can afford to give him. Suarez works hard, but he does not do that kind of running. He presses, he anticipates interceptions and runs into channels that full backs leave vacant. 

I'm not saying I want Suarez to play as a no.10, clearly Coutinho is the most naturally suited to that role. But I would prefer Suarez at full capacity upfront rather than Sturridge, because he is better. Sturridge has played wide more often than Suarez, and seems to have success playing in the kind of Hulk mold, cutting in and shooting. I don't think Suarez would enjoy playing wide, at this point in his career and where he knows he is easily the best player on our team.

Other than the Arsenal game, Rodgers has preferred Suarez upfront / off Sturridge. When he has looked for more defensive solidity he has dropped Sturridge (Chelsea, Villa, West Ham) rather than drop Coutinho/Downing in order to play both Suarez and Sturridge.

And if you use his role for Uruguay as comparison then that is not very accurate because it is not as straightforward as it seems.

true,lowercaselibertarian,null,null,"Hey DrWooWoo, I really like your comment and would like to expand with some of my own thoughts. There was a scene in, of all things, Band of Brothers (HBO Miniseries) which made me reconsider early in life the way I think about and use certain words, one of which is ""f##"" or ""f#####"".

[The scene](http://youtu.be/sHcJtU9dr6I) (**warning**, it is extremely intense visually and emotionally) takes place in the Episode ""Why We Fight"" during the liberation of a concentration camp.  I watched it for the first time in high school and wanted to discuss the scene with my German teacher as it contained English and German and I could only understand some of the German used.  In particular, the word *Unerwünschte* eluded me.  At the time, online English-German Dictionaries did not have a good definition of the word.  The relevant conversation starts at around 4:30, which I have transcribed:

**Pvt. Liebgott:** Was ist das hier?

**Prisoner:** Das... Das... Das hier ist ein Arbeitslager für... für... für Unerwünschte wirklich.

**Pvt. Liebgott:** He says it's for... uhm, Unerwünschte.  I'm not sure what the word means, sir.  Uhm...  Unwanted?  Disliked, maybe?

**Maj. Winters:** Criminals?

**Pvt. Liebgott:** I don't think criminals, sir.  Ehm, Verbrecher?

**Prisoner:** Verbrecher?  Nein, nein.  Ärzte, Musiker, Beamte, Bauern, Screiber, Schneider...  Juden.  Juden.  Juden.

The German should be fairly obvious, and the video provides an in context translation.  When I showed this video to my German teacher (himself a German) during free period, and asked him about the word, ""Unerwünschte,"" he was silent for a good thirty seconds.  Then he said something that has stuck with me to this day, ""Yes, it sort of means 'not-wanted' or 'not wished for.'  But it doesn't really translate because **this was the word we used for the Jews.**""

The raw emotional impact of that video, and the fact that it essentially documents history, made me really reconsider as a young teenager the use of words like f##.  You'll notice that I censor myself even in discussing such words.  I will not use them, ever.  While not every person who uses such words is evil... While not every German who called a Jew ""unerwünschte"" before Hitler came to power was evil...  *Words that rob a people of their humanity contain, within themselves, the seeds of evil.*  I will not ever perpetuate the use of such words.  It's a personal moral statement.  As you might guess from my user name, I'll never support laws to ban such words but...  I'll never use such words myself and never perpetuate their use.  I hope this post explains the why of it.
