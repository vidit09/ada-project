2. Kalou was a fantastic player, we shouldn't have gotten rid of him. He's inconsistent. VERY VERY inconsistent. Its sad how inconsistent he is. But he still scored on a regular basis. He made scoring look easy. He had a lot of tap ins, but if tap ins were so easy, Mikel would've scored by now. Kalou can hold his own, and I wish we invested more into him. Not like Moses is much of a step down. 
3. Di Matteo was hellishly lucky to become full-time manager. His relationship with the players was something I've never seen before. But his tactics were entirely hit-or-miss. He won us the champions League by (brilliantly)countering the tactics of Barca and Munich.

Why does a guy with a mortgage need to buy something to rent beyond personal wealth? The rich get richer, the poor get poorer.

IMHO they need to introduce measures which will deter landlords. Introduce a landlord tax. If you own more than two properties you have to pay a tax on the others, independent of council tax paid by the tenants. This would free up a massive number of flats as landlords sell. It would probably lead to an immediate rise in rent prices, but tenants could refuse and when a flat stays empty long enough the value naturally drops.

Second, and this is probably more viable, all rented properties must be double-glazed by 2018. Give them five years to get their flats up to standard or they're not fit to be landlords. In five years time, I am utterly convinced energy bills will be crippling for the average family, and no tenant is going to make capital investments in someone else's property. And no landlord wants to make the investment themselves because there are no immediate gains, the tenant being the immediate beneficiary of the investment. So all the landlord does is wait for the complaining tenant to leave and then start the argument with the new guy, only to watch them go when they admit defeat. It's a hustle.

But you never, ever have the worry about plumbing.  Your water pump doesn't burst creating £650 worth of damage (you fix the plumbing yourself, because your a sadist).  It's worth noting the damage because on closer inspection of your insurance policy, you find it has a £500 excess.  It is much cheaper to fix it yourself.  Then throw in the fact your looking at the wiring for the pump, and suddenly you think *hmm, that can't be part P* so you get a mate to have a quick look, and uh oh.  Well that was £700, only so low because of mates rates, it took 4 days to re-wire.  This obviously was missed by the survayer, by me and not caused by the pump failing, so not covered by insurance.   One day effectively cost more than a months mortgage payments and had to be fixed quickly.

Of course this is often correlated with an expensive time of the year such as winter.  It wasn't just the two weeks that I only could shower with my bucket, but the fact I had to find an extra few hundred quid that month because the services charges had an extraordinary cost, the lift had needed a major service.  Now we're talking almost 3 months rent I had to find in 4 weeks....  Time to sell the ISA.

Or when you realise you've got damp.  You have to remove all the tiles, buy a de-humidifier.  Again insurance here is pretty much useless, afterall we're not going to be above the excess.

If you've got the rent at £550pcm, and a mortgage would be £400pcm, add in insurance for the building, then saving for things like the boiler, fitted appliances, that gap closes quite a bit.  Factor in the whole rates often rise, the mortgage can often rise with only a months notice.

A reasonable amount of due diligence will protect you from most problems.

You should never be committing to somewhere without having first inspected it.

If the property that you rent is not safe or has essential repairs that are needed you can (although not recommended) follow a very specific procedure that involves withholding your rent until the repairs are made or pay for the repairs yourself and deduct the cost from your rental payments. 

The procedure involves informing the landlord of your problem, providing them a week to resolve the problem (or make steps towards a resolution) if at this point nothing is done send a follow up letter informing them that you will be repairing the problem yourself and deducting the costs incurred from the next rental payment, give them 7 days and if they don't respond then do it.

(*Anecdote time: my brother is looking to move to a completely new town for work and needs to go in a couple of weeks. The flat he's found is unfortunately through an agency. In addition to the first month's rent of £550, deposit of £550, the agency want: £180 agreement fee, £75 reference fee, £60 admin fee, £60 inventory check; so £375 in total.

Then you need to be very careful that your mortgage rate will not rise.  Right now we've got very low rates, what would be £800pcm now, could easily become £1500pcm in a months time.

Depending on where you live, have a look at the sale prices for something similar, add on Stamp Duty, then look at what a mortgage would be, often its the same price or more than the rent, unless you've got a 25% deposit.  For instance my place which I bought most of 7 years ago, has risen in value a bit, but the rental income would be about £1400pcm, if you consider the interest on £300k, we're talking about £1k a month.  Then the service charges of £150, insurances of about £50.  That would mean I would have a 'profit' of £200 a month if I was to let it.  But when you consider that upkeep and repair for things has cost me about £6k over the last few years, that really isn't much.  I also have a strong suspicsion that service charges are going to rise by £30 pcm next quarter.

I'd go as far as to say I would not highly recommend ownership of the property.  I might be a whole 10% richer.... On paper, but compared to my pension funds, this performance is poor.  We're not talking 3% per year, so as an investment it's not good.  Obviously the fact I can have the place just how I want, makes up for this.

I don't like to go in to personal finances on the net, but hopefully it will explain why the grass isn't always greener.  If your seeing it as loosing out economically, that isn't the case, you loose out because you can't have the place how you want.

On the other hand, he's such a good footballer it almost seems crazy to want him to go.

All in all, I just feel that he's created too many issues and dug too many holes for himself.

The best thing the Government can do for first time buyers is increase the housing supply (by for example, building homes for all those on Housing Benefit in the Private Sector) and create no borrowing assistance.

He and his family clearly aren't happy in England, but I must be nit picky and take issue with the headline: he doesn't INSIST he needs to leave Liverpool, but explicitly hints he'd be happier elsewhere. Insisting he needs to leave would be a transfer request, which we may hear about once the window opens... :/

It's official: I'm no longer in Suarez denial. Brilliant talent but a bit of a headcase - he's totally lovable when he's YOUR player; we know his antics are  weaknesses in his self control rather than characteristics of an inhumane asshole, we know he's not a racist and the bite was an awful mistake made from frustration tightening his ego (Freudian sense) into a tunnel vision decision.

Will we miss him? Fuck yes. But enough is enough, he's not happy in England and the undying support of club and fans isn't enough for him and his family anymore. We can't console his wife; we can't stop Manchester blokes from mocking him and his family in public. He's not doing us any favors by talking so much to the media, but he's not thinking about the transfer fees; he's a footballer and his agent does the negotiating, all he really knows is that he has a contract with Liverpool for x years and until that changes he'll be a Liverpool player.

Suarez leaving looks inevitable nowadays, but now we can realistically dream about bringing in a Mkhitaryan or Eriksen. We can win some big-name bidding wars if we're smart, quick, and efficient about them. If this is so long Luis, so long!

All this talk of ""I thought Luis was a better person than this"" is bullcrap. I doubt many of you have ever met the man and even if you have it can't have been long enough to get to know his personality. There's also been a lot of talk about like he's the worst thing that's ever happened to LFC. Earlier I read something like ""All Luis has given us is trouble and headaches"". Think before you type, this is not true. 

He's scored over 50 goals for is in 2&amp;1/2 seasons. He's galvanised and inspired the team, He's gotten the apprehensive Liverpool supporters back on board and taken it upon himself to help us achieve one of the best seasons in recent years. He's helped us beat rivals and single handedly dug us out of trouble a fair number of times. He's helped us reach two cup finals and win one. He's also probably half the reason Sturridge and Countinho joined the club, because they knew they'd be playing with one of the best in the world. Yes he's controversial but you have to take the bad with the good sometimes.

Luis has been a great servant to the club and wanting to move onto bigger and better things is understandable when you see how much he wants to win and how hard he works to be successful. Be it for Liverpool or Uruguay you can see he's hungry for goals, wins and titles, but unfortunately we haven't been able to offer the latter consistently and by the time Liverpool FC are at that stage and are ready to it he'd be past his best. The family reasons for him wanting to leave make an awful lot of sense too, he won't be completely exempt from criticism in Spain but he'll definitely have a cleaner slate over there. 

Another thing to add is that  he's not constantly trying to angle a move to Madrid, yes he wants to go but there are reasons we keep seeing the story.  1- As a headline it generates page views/sales. 2- He has to do interviews and talk to the media frequently, every time he does he gets the same damn questions. How's he supposed to deal with the same question honestly without giving the same answer?!

Businesses exist to make a profit, and the government pass legislation to limit what those businesses are allowed to do in order to make a profit. 

For example businesses  aren't allowed to use unsafe working practices, to pay less than the minimum wage, to discriminate on grounds of race or gender, even if these practices reduce their costs and make them more profitable.

In the same way, it's perfectly reasonable to prevent a business from using  a blacklist, if the consequences to potential employees are sufficiently undesirable. This may well reduce the ability of the business to screen out genuinely undesirable employees, but businesses need to be constrained by the law to operate in the interests of society as a whole.

true,ZombieWomble,null,null,"Notwithstanding the ""Ask the Irish what they think"" angle, no, I don't think everyone would be better off under this scheme.

Even within the UK, different regions have very different financial, social and economic needs - it's a common complaint that British policy is primarily set to serve London, and the outer regions suffer economically as a result. This leads to a nasty cycle where they're dependent on tax money to flow out of London to support them, which means London gets more clout, and so forth.

Adding the current RoI into the mix doesn't help anything - it only managed to gain some degree of relevance in recent years by pursuing a somewhat alternative fiscal path to the larger countries*. Shackling it to economic policies planned by London would probably have left it in the same position as N. Ireland, without any hope of ever paying its own way (NI has about a 50% budget defecit, dwarfing the debt levels of the republic which are viewed as unsustainable).

The alternative then, is full fiscal devolution - but why stop there? Many many social issues are viewed differently in the republic, and voters wouldn't take kindly to being subsumed into UK law. After that, what's left? Foreign policy? Again, the two countries have very different opinions on those matters. 

You can mumble vaguely about ""strength"" or ""influence"" or similar of a united group, but what do the smaller constituent countries gain if that influence is used for purposes of which they don't approve?

(* - Yes, the RoI's economic policy went off the rails on the run-up and into the recent recession, but in many parts that's more a question of degree, than the overall policy. A slightly less break-neck pace of growth would probably have been much more sustainable, and certainly better than the older economic policies.)",0,1370974479,null,0,false,0,cagr399,t3_1g4ush,t1_cagr399,t3_1g4ush,null,1430846976,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

At that point, it doesn't matter if he gets sent back in time because the Doctor [doesn't mind replacing him](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hlGlCW9uQc&amp;t=1m42s).

**Vampires of Venice:** The effectiveness of perception filters against K-9 would need to be addressed, at least.

**Amy's Choice:** K-9 probably does not dream.

**Hungry Earth/Cold Blood:** Make K-9 watch over Alaya instead of the humans from that episode, who are apparently unable to *not* kill stuff. He obviously wouldn't kill her, and peace between human and silurian would probably be achieved.

**Vincent and the Doctor:** I assume that K-9 would at *least* be able to tell that the creature was there at lot quicker than the Doctor and Amy could. Bare minimum, he would save some time.

**The Lodger:** In School Reunion, it's K-9 that scans the oil and determines its Krillitane origin. Just have him scan the shit leaking through the ceiling, and Eleven knows what he's dealing with from the first minute.

**The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon/Wedding of River Song:** You know those eyepatches everyone had to wear in order to remember that the silence were around? K-9 is essentially one of those that can also talk and use logic. Being a robot, his brain is nothing *but* external storage.

**God Complex:** K-9 would be immune to 90% of everything that was happening in the episode. Being a robot, he lacks the capacity for fear or faith and thus would probably not have a door at all. The minotaur also wouldn't have any interest in him to begin with because of those factors.

As far as the overall arc of season 6, I just assume that K-9 would've been able to work out more than the characters could on the fly. He recognized the Doctor despite him having regenerated, so his introduction to Mels would have been interesting to say the least.

**Asylum of the Daleks:** K-9 can probably ""hack"" just as well as Clara. On top of that, the Doctor could send him out to lower the shields while he and the companions stay safe. [At that point....](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hlGlCW9uQc&amp;t=1m58s)

**A Town Called Mercy:** K-9's opinion on the matter of whether or not to kill Jex would've been valuable.

**Bells of Saint John:** ""Hacking"".

**Journey to the Center of the TARDIS:** K-9 has the TARDIS basecode. I'm sure that would've came in handy.

**Crimson Horror:** K-9 probably would've detected an extra life form any time that Mrs. Gillyflower was around.

You could probably work out similar lists for just about every other Doctor, and that's why K-9 is such an incredible badass.",0,1370976086,null,0,1370976409,0,cagrrh5,t3_1g3fh3,t1_cagrrh5,t1_cagfy2x,null,1430846659,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

At least when they blocked TPB they were only allowed to specifically block the websites given in the court order. Now they seem to have the authority to start blocking proxies of those websites without referring to anyone. I'd imagine they'll eventually get the authority to also block the proxy list websites.

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"It's not so much about foreigners not being welcome but that English players are preferred.

If you have the same grade of player as an Englishman or a foreigner it's more beneficial to the Club to take the Englishman because of the regulations imposed in both the Champions League and the PL.
This is not to say foreigners cannot fulfil these regulations, Pique would if he came back to England, having been at Man U for 3 years and obviously if he wanted to leave, the English Clubs would be happy to pay an absolute fortune that would look absurd even for the premier league (if you didn't know the aforementioned reasoning to do so). Also, Sigurdsson @ Tottenham was at Reading and qualifies. Hence Tottenham bought him this season as a squad player who fulfils a certain slot in the squad registration. A very handy signing IMO.

This is why English players have inflated prices to other PL clubs. If anything it's discrimination by the PL but some would argue it's necessary because other wise there would be even less English players at the top level. I believe the FA could restructure allowing Reserve Clubs to play but they've so far rejected the idea. Also, many other leagues have similar restrictions. In France I believe your only allowed 4 foreign players. But if they're from the EU they don't count as foreign (I think that may be due to EU regulation as they have to be granted rights to work in the country or something like that). 

Also it's not so much of a problem in America because you have your own games that are only really extensively popular in a few countries. Football is probably the most widely played sport in the world.

Of course if you know all this and you still think it's just xenophobic then fair enough. I'm just elaborating on the case for these ideas. To an extent it is, but it's in the interest of each country's respective national team and I hardly blame them. There wouldn't be such a problem if English talent dominated the world leagues to the extent of the French, Brazilian or even Belgian now ahaha.",0,1370976833,null,0,false,0,cags2oh,t3_1g3v1v,t1_cags2oh,t1_cagjmfb,null,1430846512,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

As for modular maths. It makes sense to do it that way. Mixing mechanics, pure and statistics together doesn't make much sense. They've always been distinct examinations. They just test them more often now. You can't forget the early stuff because the late stuff builds on it. You can't complete P2 without understanding P1 and the same goes for P3.

It is like saying kids are building a ladder by putting in the first step, throwing it away and then making the second step. It doesn't make sense. How can you teach integration by parts if you don't understand basic integration? Hell the reason resits are so prevalent is by the time kids have done P2 they understand P1 better.

true,Frankeh,eng-eastsusex,South East,"Renting is the biggest con ever and landlords are some of the scummiest business owners ever.

Take, for example, my last rental. 

2 bed maisonette in brighton. Landlord bought it in 1999 for £45,999. Now worth a minimum of £140,000. 

He was charging us £800 a month to use it. While we were there we paid  around £20,000 to him of which almost all of it was likely profit. Yep, over 2 and a bit years we paid off almost half of what he bought it for. 

So, when we come to leave what does he do to thank us for our custom? He stings us for £200 of the deposit. He said it wasn't clean enough and that there was a stain on the lino in the bathroom. 

I personally spent 2 hours cleaning the rooms he complained about. I know they were clean. 

Landlords sting you because they know the chance of repeat custom is as near as matters zero. There's **NO** reason to be nice to a tenant after they've decided to stop paying you. 

In no other business would this kind of bullshit be acceptable. Imagine if you had a contract with a company to supply you £10,000 worth of A4 paper each year and you accidentally sent them £200 too much. 

You'd not even bring it up. It would be unimaginable to try and you'd just put it down as comp'd. They're a good customer and £200 to keep them happy is nothing. 

Not when it comes to the landlord business. 

Then there's fucking letting agents. £200 to get 'references'.. Why the fuck am I being charged for referencing? I know I'm legit. I know that I'm going to pay each month. What possible service am I receiving for my £200?

Worst case was the current flat I moved into. I handed over £180 and they sent me a link to this site:

http://www.legal4landlords.com/tenant-referencing/

It was a deep link where I fill in my details but I removed all the bullshit and checked the root URL to see what it's all about. 

£35. £35 the referencing is and I was charged £180. They didn't even take my fucking details, I had to enter them on the site.

I never finished it and ended up giving it away to Barnardo's along with other stuff. 

Even in the book he kept talking about how much he loved the club and how all his friends supported the club and how much the red meant to him. All just bullshit to sell his fucking book.

Anyway, after that I vowed never to get attached to any player so much. Also, growing up helped. So when Suarez goes, I wont lose sleep over it, or feel depressed about it. Sure, I'll be disappointed that I won't get to see him play. Afterall, he is the third best player in the world. There will never be another player like him. His playing style is inimitable. It was an absolutely joy watching him for 2.5 years. If his heart is set on a move, let him leave.

There's other things to take into account such as insurance, repairs and letting agent fees. But it'll give you a good idea of how much you're getting fucking shafted. ",0,1370981759,null,0,1370983605,0,cagu4r2,t3_1g49mq,t1_cagu4r2,t1_cagu2e8,null,1430845543,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

That's why there is **independent deposit protection services** that have absolutely no bias. If your landlord is unreasonable when it comes to your deposit you are protected. If your landlord chooses not to use one of these services they have broken the law and you are eligible for up to 3x the value of the deposit in recompense, on top of the deposit.

If your landlord does not do an inventory when you move in they cannot charge you for damage, they **need** to prove you did the damage. If you did do the damage then of fucking course you'll be charged for it.

&gt; Then there's fucking letting agents. £200 to get 'references'.. Why the fuck am I being charged for referencing? I know I'm legit. I know that I'm going to pay each month. What possible service am I receiving for my £200?

Credit check, chasing up employers for proof of employment etc. They certainly make money here but there is a valid reason for referencing.

true,Frankeh,eng-eastsusex,South East,"&gt;Credit check, chasing up employers for proof of employment etc. They certainly make money here but there is a valid reason for referencing. When you rent a house out you're giving the tenant possession of the property and you can only evict with a court order, you wouldn't do that without due diligence.

Why am I paying for that though? That's a service that the landlord wants. 

Banks don't make people who apply for loans pay for their credit check because they know they'll just make the price of the credit check back from the customer. Same should be said for landlords.

The whole thing is set up to squeeze every fucking penny they can from renters. 

&gt;That's why there is independent deposit protection services that have absolutely no bias. If your landlord is unreasonable when it comes to your deposit you are protected.

Yes, great in theory but fucking shit in practice. You have to have the deposit for your new place before the deposit on your old place is released. Deposits are usually 6 weeks rent or as near as matters £1000 where I live. I can't afford to throw £1000 into a new deposit and then battle for weeks to get my old deposit back, if I'll even win at all. It's a bit better now that they release the undisputed amount of your deposit right away and only leave the disputed amount locked up.. But that's still very very awkward. 

Referencing and end of tenancy cleaning (within reason) should all be costs absorbed by the landlord, imo. It's £40 odd for referencing and a couple hundred for cleaning. Peanuts considering how much they make off tenants. 

Landlords just pass off every expense of running their business that they possibly can, and it's so institutionalized that there's even people like you arguing **for** it. Blows my fucking mind.

If they're young and want to save towards a family and home then they could save at least £1000 per month, if they're willing to make sacrifices they can make even more savings. I actually made a post yesterday on another forum about this exact scenario (joint average salary), it was a couple earning the average for a joint couple that had &lt;£5k saved and were looking for help with getting a deposit:

&gt; £50,000 pre-tax between 2 people is probably £40,000 after tax. £40,000 / 12 is £3,333 PCM. Your rent is £700 PCM which leaves you with ~£2600. Utilities, council tax and misc. running costs of a (rented) home comes to probably about £400 per month, then add on costs of food that's probably another £400 taking you down to £1800.

&gt; You should be able to save at least £1000 per month, maybe even more. 2 years of saving £1,000 per month would give you over 10% of a deposit on a £200k house (with fees included). 

Anyone complaining about the cost of things should take a hard look at their expenditures. Recently I decided to look at my own finances and it's absolutely shocking how much money can be wasted just by doing things like eating dominoes twice a week or buying the cool things you want but don't need. I'm saving over £1k/month at the moment just by budgeting properly and being careful how I spend. I don't *need* to (fortunately have a very good salary) but being able to save an extra £12k per year is worth it...

true,cech_mate,present,Didier Drogba is a Legend,"A fan, sometimes also called aficionado or supporter, is a person who is enthusiastically devoted to something, such as a band, a sports team or entertainer. Collectively, fans of a particular thing or person constitute its fanbase or fandom. They may show their enthusiasm by being members of a fan club, holding fan conventions, creating fanzines, writing fan mail, or by promoting the object of their interest and attention.

Fans usually have a strong enough interest that some changes in their lifestyles are made to accommodate devotion to the focal object. Fans have a desire for external involvement – they are motivated to demonstrate their involvement with the area of interest through certain behaviors (attending conventions, posting online, displaying team banners outside their homes, etc.). Fans often have a ""wish to acquire"" material objects related to the area of interest, such as a baseball hit by a famous slugger or a used guitar pick from their musical hero. As well, some fans have a desire for social interaction with other fans. This again may take many forms, from casual conversation, e-mail, chat rooms, and electronic mailing lists to regular face-to-face meetings such as fan club meetings and organized conventions.

true,AwhMan,eng-eastsusex,East Sussex,"With Romeo and Juliet it's easy enough to watch the modern adaptation and understand it pretty great, but with much ado it's a bit harder as Shakespearean comedies are hard to really get right. 

But the thing with studying English lit at this level is - You don't particularly need to understand it. Just remember your essay structure, parrot off key points from the cliff notes and slip in a technical word every other sentence and you're ticking all the boxes. Your essay structure should go like this:

Introduction - Should make the exact same points as your conclusion, if you can, leave a space and write it last to make sure they match up. In the first sentence introduce what the thing is whilst also adding in the essay title (ie Title = How does Juliet change during the course of the play? = ""Romeo and Juliet is the eponymous Shakespearean tragedy that focuses on the journey between two ""star crossed lovers"", Juliet changes drastically throughout the play and arguably how she changes is more important then the end result of those changes"" Or something less shit, you get the point) Then expand to mention 2 or three different points, those points will then be the topics of your paragraphs. For GCSE you should probably only make 2 points, figure out what is her main change and use the two points to argue for and against this (the argue one should also compliment it in some way) Obviously avoid using the first person in this, use instead statements like ""it can be argued"" and such. 

Paragraph 1. Repeat one of the points you made in your introduction for the first sentance. Use your against point here. Like if you've decided that the biggest change is like... I don't know her going against her family then use a point about her growing up or something for this one. There will be points and in your cliffnotes that you can lift almost word for word for this, there's not need to come up with your own stuff. It compliments the other but is kind of different. (I've never actually studied this play specifically...) Then go on to back up your statement with quotes from the text, it's best to slip them in the middle of a sentence (like I did with star cross lovers up above) instead of introduction them like ""in act 2 scene 3 Juliet says ""bla bla bla"". Try and point out the technical things that Shakespeare uses to emphasise your point (analyse it like you would poetry instead of a book), throw in some mention of iambic pentameter if you're feeling fancy and up to it. Bitches love iambic pentameter. 

Second paragraph. Should be structured like your second, but you're trying to argue for your point this time, this will lead nicely onto your conclusion. DON'T FORGET TO RANDOMLY THROW IN TECHNICAL LANGUAGE. METAPHORS, SIMILES, ENJAMBERMENT, PROSE, STANZA, FUCKING USE THEM, YOU GET MARKS FOR IT.

Conclusion. Should say the same shit as your introduction, but draws on some of your expanded points in your paragraphs. 

Seriously, a big thing people trip up on is their essay structure, people in university still struggle with it. But once you've got it down as long as you've read your cliff notes and can remember your technical words you're ready to fucking go mate. You're welcome to ignore this but the only thing I'm good at is essay writing. I read a fuck ton of marking schemes to come to my conclusion about how to write essays, I advise you read some.

true,spongebob391,null,null,"Newcastle finished above us last season. They certainly had a top 4 contending team. This season though, they've brought in so many French players at the expense of other English players, there's bound to be discord in the dressing room. Last season they had 4 French players and this season they had 8 and it's not down to a lack of quality with these French players. Sissoko has been brilliant and so has Cabaye, Debuchy and Ben Arfa. I just think that it would not be possible to work as a collective unit with such a divide in the team. 

With Man City though, it's a different story. They never had an established English core to begin with so the whole team is relatively new. Barry, Milner, Hart and Lescott all came in with the revolution if I remember correctly. This made for an easy transition without ego's getting hurt. But then again, if you look at the money spent on that side it's hard not to challenge for honors with such quality at their disposal. Also, they have a pretty even set of nationals, unlike Chelsea that has a large Brazilian and Spanish contingent which is what i'm afraid of because it will end up in cliques that could ruin the chemistry within the team.

true,notnotcitricsquid,cnty-uk,Stafford,"&gt; Why am I paying for that though? That's a service that the landlord wants.

The landlord doesn't *want* to do a reference check, a landlord has to do a reference check. Can you imagine the situation if anyone could apply to rent a property and had no investment in the process? I can understand complaining about some of the large fees but the fact that you have to pay for the cost of a reference check is perfectly acceptable.

The difference between a bank loan and a property rental should be quite clear, banks have access to your credit history already (through your dealings with them and licenses with the big credit agencies) and have a way to deal with people that don't pay (your credit will go to shit if you screw with a bank) whereas landlords have... well, they could try and sue you but first they have to spend 3 months evicting you.

&gt; Deposits are usually 6 weeks rent or as near as matters £1000 where I live. I can't afford to throw £1000 into a new deposit and then battle for weeks to get my old deposit back, if I'll even win at all.

Are you earning minimum wage? If so have you considered house shares in the short term to give yourself chance to build up cash reserves? Living pay cheque to pay cheque and spending ~£1000 on rent is very financially irresponsible. I don't understand what you think the solution to this is either, no deposits? no reference checks? Just as many tenants screw up as landlords, without reference checks and deposits landlords would be in awful positions. 

&gt; Referencing and end of tenancy cleaning (within reason) should all be costs absorbed by the landlord, imo. It's £40 odd for referencing and a couple hundred for cleaning. Peanuts considering how much they make off tenants.

If this was the case the cost would just be passed on to tenants through increased monthly rental. Having the costs upfront (although there should be some legislation in place regarding ridiculous fees) is the most sensible route. 

&gt; Landlords just pass off every expense of running their business that they possibly can, and it's so institutionalized that there's even people like you arguing for it. Blows my fucking mind.

Maybe you've had bad luck or I've just had exceptional good luck, but every landlord I've had has looked after the property I lived in well and even though one of the landlords ""forgot"" to pay his mortgage and almost had the apartment repossessed, he still dealt with my issues in a timely manner. I spend quite a lot of time reading consumer finance forums and reading all about landlord and tenancy problems, there are definitely some poor quality landlords out there and there needs to be better legislation in place to deal with some of the problems, however a lot of tenants are just as much to blame for a huge number of problems.",0,1370984139,null,0,false,0,cagv5cr,t3_1g49mq,t1_cagv5cr,t1_cagum3u,null,1430844993,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

This means they tend to have less funding than ones that do hence why i think it's most likely budget issues as hiring one actor or comedian for 6 months on different shows is probably cheaper meaning that they can put out more content. That's my guess anyway.  

As for Mitchell he's one of mine as well his manner makes him more funny to me. Although Peep show and the Mitchell and Webb series are probably him at his best in my opinion. 

Blackadder's humour comes what's more understated a lot of the time. The self deprecation and often understatement that feature in the show are what we Brits thrive on and Atkinson can play that up nicely. The humour tends to appeal to different people in different ways though.

People like the UK version of the office for different reasons production wise the US one likely had a much higher budget to the UK one as for writing the humour lies in how they act, some people feel that the UK has characters that are more realistic and I would guess what we may find funny compared to the US version.

As for things to watch for comedy if you haven't seen them i'd suggest [The thin blue line](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1hBqKlo47c)  I'm guessing you've already seen some Monty Python but if you haven't it's something you may like if you want to see Atkinson in another role he's in both of those.

true,throwaway_mr_teacher,null,null,"Throwaway here for reasons that will become obvious.


The whole secondary education system needs a shakeup in schools in this country. At the minute, the grades that some students get depend more on the school they go to and their teachers than their ability as a student. Why? I shall explain.


I work in a supposedly outstanding school. What that means is the pressure to get good grades from *every* student is absolutely enormous. Students just are not allowed to fail. If a student is ever in danger of failing, the question is asked - ""what are you doing about it?"" I was in a meeting with the head recently where a member of my department had put down via email his concerns about a student and missing coursework. He had rang parents, put on lunchtime and after school support (which the student had ran away from), set the student extra homework, sat with him individually in lessons to go through what he had to do and set him extra homework. The result? The kid didn't want to know and still hadn't done the work. So did the head congratulate him in his efforts? Not a chance; he made it absolutely clear that it wasn't enough to simply offer this support, he had to make sure he attended and it was suggested that he walk down to the yard at lunchtime and escort the student up to the room and sit with him to make sure that he did it. It was also made absolutely clear that the teacher's pay increase depended upon all (not some, or most, but every single one) of his students hitting the magical C grade.


Of course, some teachers may decide that spending hours and hours chasing a student to do 10 minutes worth of work isn't worth it and may instead simply do the work themselves, put the students' name at the top and be done with it. Others may decide not to bother at all and simply make up a coursework grade, waiting until the external moderator calls a sample (and they only ever do check a few samples) before sorting out out in a hurry. I couldn't possibly comment.


It's endemic. I may (or may not) have seen students given last year's students' coursework and told to copy it out and put their name at the top. I may (or may not) have seen teachers talk students through, line bye line, whatever coursework they are doing so that it becomes a ""write this out in your own words"" exercise.


It's not just coursework though, even exams are fair game for those in danger of not getting the magic C grade. Early entry is a popular tactic, getting students to sit the exam a year or two early - if they pass with a C great, if not - they repeat and do it at the next opportunity. Every time, a few more students will pass and so the group to resit gets smaller and smaller, with more and more teacher resources put into an ever smaller group of children. I may even (or may not have) seen readers (an adult who either reads out the questions or writes down the answer for students if they can't for some reason) be used to ""ensure"" that a student would get a C - what's that Timmy, you think the answer is 74? I'll just write that down for you as 65.


This is only just scratching the surface though, the issue is that as long as the expectation / target is that all students pass, and enough pressure is applied from above, you'll get this. Gove's reforms are spot on in my eyes, if only because they'll remove so much of the above. We need as a society to be able to differentiate between the top performers and the bottom performers. If someone gets a C grade in maths, employers need to be sure that they can actually do basic arithmetic and not have just been handed a C grade by their teacher because of the situation in their school. I hope (fingers crossed) that some of these reforms might actually lead to students getting what they deserve, for better or for worse.",0,1370984807,null,0,false,0,cagvfb5,t3_1g4rio,t1_cagvfb5,t3_1g4rio,null,1430844863,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

Also, the controlled assessments (essentially courseworks done under exam conditions) were utterly ridiculous. The questions were given to you before so you had plenty of time to prepare for it. You were also allowed to take one sheet of notes in. Although the word count was limited for languages, they weren't for English for some reason. This meant that everyone crammed as much as they could into the one page of notes and just memorised the whole essay. The system might have been changed now but controlled assessments encouraged you to memorise a whole 2000-word essay.

The one thing I agree with Gove is the single board per subject. This makes logical sense and would allow exams to be made harder across all subjects without fundamentally changing the structure of the course or exams.

* Marin - not enough game time for him to be described, yet everyone just disses him up fuck all

* Luiz needs to control his discipline. As much as I admire the geezer he gets a yellow far too often. And he's mediocre in midfield, not bad nor good, just plain old normal (which incidentally is a good thing, rotation)

* Chelsea needs to get more English players. As much as everyone likes Uncle Roman dishing out $$$$$$$$$$$$ to buy mercenaries this shouldn't be. Bring up some English youth players/invest in some young English players.

* Lampard and Terry are at the end of their career. Don't say ""Lamps is our Giggs"". Fat Frank has still got some game in him though, but EBJT is no more. Time to find a new CB and a new captain.

* Lukaku is ready.

* I reiterate, Lukaku is ready

* Hazard had a mediocre season (by his standards). I'm expecting him to improve drastically this season otherwise he'll just be a flop IMO

* Can Chelsea give Mata a season off ? He deserves a rest more than everyone else on the Chelsea team, Spain team and the lad just keeps going and going and going (and going).

fucking thank you, Liverpool's relentless exporting of their own tragedies (for which they are responsible for, thank you very much) bothers me immensely. They are hands down the worst club in the premier league from a neutral perspective, their PR is ridiculous, as evidenced by them defending Suarez after his obvious racism. 

And another thing--why is Hillsborough treated as a crime perpetrated *against* Liverpool fans by the police? It was at least 50% the fault of the fans, if not more. Liverpool fans were notorious for turning up without tickets and forcing their way into the stands. That caused the crush. The police funneling them in from the wrong entrances etc was to alleviate crowd pressure *caused by ticketless fans forcing their way in*. Yet no one is ever allowed to mention this. No, we are forced to observe their moments of silence, grieve for their loss, when that has simply nothing to do with our club. No other footballing tragedy is peddled so relentlessly and shoved down the throats of other teams in a bid for 'sympathy' or god knows what. And what of Heysel? By the logic of Liverpool fans, along with the yearly outpouring of hate for the police/Thatcher/the daily mail, who ostensibly murdered 96 of their countrymen, we should reserve a day to remember and vilify those who deliberately murdered 39 Juve fans, and forced English clubs out of Europe for 5 years. Liverpool are a club that beget hate, they are hateful, the Liverpool fans that I know perpetrate some of the shameless doublethink and hypocrisy, yes I know every fan is guilty of viewing things through a particular set of blue or red-tinted glasses, myself included, but honestly of the fans that I know in real life, Liverpool ones bother me the most.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Honestly, I think something to consider when buying a player is not only their skill/talent but their overall demeanor and sportsmanship. Suarez is a perfect example of an unsporting player. He has missed now 20 matches for Liverpool because of crazy actions of his. He has committed a laundry list of offenses that boggle the mind. His handball against Ghana showed that he doesn't respect the game, or his fellow professionals. He will do anything, anything to win. That might be a good attitude for a top player, you say.

If you want slightly cheaper rent and maybe more space or a garden then it might be worth looking towards Eastney/Milton as there are bigger properties there that can be a bit nicer.

Bars: I don't find them too low, but then I'm looking at riding a CBR500R after this so I guess low bars just don't bother me.

Seat: Uncomfortable after an hour, it's not to high but it's a little hard for my liking.

Suspension: It's rubbish. It's hard over bumps, doesn't really do a great job for handling and is there to do a basic job really.

Front brake: Grabby? Mine is pathetic. I have to pull mine quite hard to get any sort of reasonable response from the brake. Can we swap? I'd love a more aggressive brake.

Wheels: Don't get me started. I probably have wider tyres on my mountain bike. They are sized so awkwardly you can only guy Conti Go's for it and the bike isn't fantastic at handling in the dry, and in the wet a little bit of lean will send it wobbling into oblivion.

Its the sorry truth but England just isn't churning out many world class players right now.

And the little talent that is available isn't for sale, ala Jack Wilshere, Oxlade-Chamberlin, Phil Jones, ect. When you look at Germany and Spain for example, their youth setup is amazing and is churning out great talents every year.  Spain's U-21 team could probably beat a fair amount of national teams.

1. Harder to connect with. We as humans have an easier time to connect with humanoid or humanlike beings making them better for storytelling purposes. 

2. Dislike it as much as you want but fact is that intelligent life will probably be quite similar to us. There are a few things that are more or less ""scientific facts"" regarding intelligent life. 

To start of Intelligence on our level requires both evolution and civilization something that often means tools. This leads to having appendages available to operate said tools.

This leads to limbs and walking. A great number of limbs occupy large parts of the brain to coordinate which means we would end up with 4 or maybe 6 limbs. (Uneven numbers are very unusual) And having appendages and limbs to operate tools requires ""upright"" walking due to having them free to use for other things than movement.

Size would be rather similar to ours as well due to smaller beings not having the requisite musculature and bone density to support the large brain required for intelligence, and larger beings would not have the nutrition intake to sustain a large brain and would lack the skeleton and muscles to support upright walking. Larger creatures also need to eat very much and very often to support their size which leaves little time for intelligent activity. 

This of course if Doctor Who writers try to adhere to any form of scientific accuracy.

EDIT:

Also given the fact that OP is requesting Alienlife that are in fact intelligent and not plants or non-civilized beasts.

Howeverrrrr... the VAT is also applicable to the *shipping* value as well as the product, so add on 20% of whatever it costs to send it over too.

1.  I don't think Roman will go on another 100+ mil spree this summer.  There just is NO need for that when you take a look at our current squad.  Our team has a theme: YOUTH and DEPTH.  We don't need to spend 100+ mil when we have Oscar (21), Hazard (22?), Mata (24), Lukaku (20), De Bruyne (20), Ake, Chalobah, ect.  This team is half full of world class players already and all of them will be world class players within 4-5 years.  That said, I don't think we need to or will sell Mata.  IMO he's the best #10 playmaker in the world right now, he has a phenomenal season with 19 goals and 34 assists.  Getting rid of Mata would hurt our team significantly.

3.  This is absolutely correct.  Our board's dealings in the transfer market in the last couple years have been phenomenal.

4.  I don't ever want to see Hulk in a Chelsea jersey.  Ever.  I don't ever want to see Schurrle in a Chelsea jersey.  Ever.  I want to see Cavani in a Chelsea jersey tommorow!  Our squad is obviously lacking in the ST department--Torres is obviously past it, I don't care what anybody says; he will never again be the player he once was.  If we could get Cavani for Torres+Cash to Napoli/Benitez (his secret lover) then I would be ecstatic.

5.  John Terry, even in his decline, is the lifeblood of the team.  He bleeds Chelsea.  Selling him for 7m is NOT worth it when you look at what he still offers to the team.  You can't buy leadership, passion, and love for the club.  He should retire as a blue and stay on as a coach.

6.  I &lt;3 Luiz.  Another player that I don't want us to get rid of.

7.  Bertrand showed us during this season that he can be very useful as a squad player/backup.  He actually impressed me when AC3 was out injured during the season.

I myself, being younger, and with little respect for what I was good at, chose to study the sciences for my first year of A level education. I did absolutely terribly - two Es, a D and a C - and was (thankfully) allowed to redo year 12 (or lower sixth). Setting myself back a year really motivated me to do better in my new choices, and with little distraction from friends in class, I could actually focus on the work at hand. When combined with the ability to retake some exams I'd failed in January, I was able to hone my academic talents to a much greater degree than if I had simply been told at the end of two years that the way I'd written an essay had been wrong, or that I'd misunderstood the question. Whilst I accept that Gove is an intelligent man, I don't think he appreciates the positive effects of the retake system, and instead dwells on the idea that children are getting off lightly thanks to the ability to retake. As has been noted before, I believe that rather than being the responsibility of a career politician, the education system should be based on empirical research and expert analysis and advice.

As for Shrubhill Tram Depot...it's easy to break in, they just have some flimsy fencing stopping you from getting in. But clearly someone is there working, usually when the fence gets torn down, it's been fixed back in place within 24 hours. So I don't know whether you're likely to get caught or not.

In some ways its a shame Edinburgh City Council has been ahead of the curve compared to Glasgow in regenerating their torn up railway lines. In Glasgow there's still lots of abandoned tunnels and stations, whereas in Edinburgh they've all been either rebuilt as cycle paths and don't look the part anymore - or are very well sealed off (Scotland Street tunnel). I also understand Barnton Nuclear Bunker is no longer an option either - after decades of dereliction they have apparently finally got around to rebuilding it, so it's now an active construction site rather than abandoned. I haven't been to have a look myself though so can't confirm that. Easiest access to that should be on Clermiston Road North I think if you want to try regardless.

If you're willing to flaunt tresspassing laws without a care in the world, there's an abandoned train behind the south side of A1 Industrial Park in Joppa (Sir Harry Lauder Road), but be warned, it's parked on a siding of the East Coast Main Line, so it's a *very* active railway line and you'll have to be careful not to get spotted. If the driver of a passing train spots you he'll be on the radio reporting it in no time.

It's actually a bit strange that Edinburgh doesn't have more abandoned buildings, tunnels and the like given its age. Glasgow seems to have a much wider array of abandoned locations to explore. If you're ever there, check out the Botanic Gardens Railway Station.

Cambridge Uni is really not a single place that you can visit - it's made up of lots of individual colleges, many of which are popular tourist attractions. The most popular ones with tourists are lined along the River Cam. King's is the most impressive, with its [enormous chapel](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Kings_College_Chapel_Cambridge.JPG), but it is quite expensive to get into the college (most charge a small fee to visitors to help fund the college, as they spend a huge amount of money on students). You should be able to find information about visiting/touring the colleges on most of the colleges' websites. If you turn up early or late in the day (&lt;9am, &gt;5pm), you might be able to just walk into a few of the colleges (definitely not King's though) The ones I think are most worth visiting (and most central) are King's, Trinity, St John's, Clare and Downing (not sure if you can get in here).

I don't really visit tourist attractions, so I can't weigh in on most of them, but the [Museum of Zoology](http://www.museum.zoo.cam.ac.uk/) on the New Museums site has a pretty awesome whale skeleton and lots of other stuff. I believe the Earth Sciences museum is quite interesting as well, and it's literally across the road. I haven't been for a long time, but I remember the University [Botanic Gardens](http://www.botanic.cam.ac.uk/Botanic/Home.aspx) being quite nice too. [The Fitzwilliam Museum](http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/) is highly impressive. I think the Museum of the Scott Polar Research institute may also be quite interesting.

Something you almost certainly want to fit into your day is to go punting on the River Cam. The biggest company is called [Scudamore's](http://www.scudamores.com/) and it provides various options - you can take a punt yourself and take it up the river, or you can have a guided tour. The guides here are notorious for trying to make up the most ridiculous stories possible, so take what they say with a pinch of salt. I'd suggest you get your own punt if you're coming with a group (it's good fun) - you can just eavesdrop on the tour guides if you want. If you're coming by yourself then take a tour.

If you're staying into the evening, go and see the [Cambridge Footlights at the ADC](http://www.adctheatre.com/whats-on/comedy/footlights-tour-show-2013-canada.aspx). **Do it** - the Footlights have produced comedy greats like John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Douglas Adams, Hugh Dennis, Eric Idle, Robert Webb, David Mitchell, Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, Sandi Toksvig and many more. There's only one ticket left on Saturday, but if you turn up a bit before the performance you may be lucky as they're always looking for show stewards (ten minute job, then you get to watch the show). 

If you're not able to get in, you could go to something at [The Junction](http://www.junction.co.uk/), [Corn Exchange](http://www.cornex.co.uk/) or [Cambridge Arts Theatre](https://cambridgeartstheatre.purchase-tickets-online.co.uk/public/), which are all prominent venues in their own right. If you want to see something by students, then you should go to one of the two student theatres - the [ADC](http://www.adctheatre.com/whats-on/comedy/pick-me-up-a-sketch-show.aspx) (which has a 'late show' after the Footlights) or [Corpus Playroom](http://www.corpusplayroom.com/whats-on.aspx). Both are hosting well-reviewed shows - ([1](http://www.varsity.co.uk/reviews/4243), [2](http://www.varsity.co.uk/reviews/6061))

In terms of restaurants - there are an absolute tonne in Cambridge. If you're coming by train (I recommend it, traffic and parking is a nightmare), there are lots on the street between the station and the town, but I would recommend you go and look on Mill Road - there are lots of more interesting foreign restaurants there. I am a little wary of recommending that you go to an Indian restaurant this Saturday - exams have just finished and they may be a little rowdy. You may be absolutely fine, though. There's a [CAU](http://www.caurestaurants.com/) just opened in the middle of town too - I've been there and it's quite nice.

There are also a number of decent pubs here - I'm sure you'll be able to find reviews online. [The Eagle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eagle_(pub)) is quite historically interesting - it's the place that Crick and Watson ran into to announce that they had discovered DNA in 1953. It's a bit touristy, being just off King's Parade and whatnot, but there are lots of other places to go. I quite like [The Maypole](http://www.maypolefreehouse.co.uk/Welcome.html).

If you want to have lunch in Cambridge then you could go to one the of the millions of cafes (there are a *lot* of tourists here), but if the weather's nice I'd recommend you stop by M&amp;S (on Market Square) or Sainsbury's (opposite Sidney Sussex on Sidney Street) and get a sandwich, then walk to Christ's Pieces (a lovely park) to eat it.

As you're new in the country, I'm guessing you may still be looking for home-y stuff. In case you don't already know about it, [John Lewis](http://www.johnlewis.com/) is one of the best (chain) department stores in the UK - the shops are nicely laid out, good warranties/guarantees etc. There's one in the centre of Cambridge. There's also a good academic bookshop called Heffers which might be useful if you're looking for something specific.

I've pretty much run out of ideas now - but if I think of anything more I'll add it to this comment. If you have any questions while you're here, reply and I'll probably get back to you pretty quickly.

Edit: don't try to go while you're in Cambridge, but definitely find a day to go to [IWM Duxford](http://www.iwm.org.uk/visits/iwm-duxford). It's an awesome museum, particularly if you go on an air show day.

Edit 2: you could also go to a chapel service at one of the colleges. AFAIK these are almost all/all free. Most colleges have a very good chapel choir that performs in chapel 3-4 times each week. The best are probably the choirs of King's College (which is by far and away the most famous), Trinity College, St John's College and Clare College.",0,1370999698,null,0,1371003239,0,cah0yu5,t3_1g5qad,t1_cah0yu5,t3_1g5qad,null,1430842251,23,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,23

I want to start by saying that even with Suarez, I don't see us getting into the top 4 this season.

As a fan of Liverpool:

We could bring in 2 quality signings with the money from his sale. Perhaps Mkhytarian and a good defender. Next season should be about establishing some consistency within our primary squad. I’d rather have us sign two key players that can end up being vital in the long run, and begin grooming them to our system then wait to do it later when Suarez leaves.

As a fan of Suarez:

This country hates him. They are always going to be out to get him, and the fact that his family has to go through that is unfair. Sure its his fault, but even if he tried, he couldn't change the media's view on him. Missing 6 games is also very harsh on him. I'd love to see him at Real Madrid and in the Champions League tearing it up.

We were talking a few days after Suarez's first interview where he dropped that he'd like to leave due to English press, blah blah blah. My mate was shocked, disgusted, couldn't believe Suarez was like this. I really wasn't surprised. 

Often I try to consider what it'd be to be a footballer. What are your goals? Certainly, as we see players flock to Monaco, some are just mercenaries. A few years back that's what we'd call lads heading to Man City. Now anyone heading there would just be heading to a Champions League club that can challenge for all honors, no different than Utd, Madrid, Barca, Bayern, etc. The only difference is prestige. 

Well Madrid has the prestige. They've got more money than us. But the thing is I know Suarez isn't about that. No doubt he's brought a lot of trouble on himself, but there has always been a xenophobic bent to it all. Somehow Bale gets POY honors while getting booked right and left for diving. What does that say about England and the press? Would the same happen in Spain? Not a chance.

Suarez is, imo, a top ten player in the world. We're lucky he's been at Pool dazzling us. Yes, he just had his best year with us just now. But he's clearly class.

I'm a LFC fan through and through, but I can understand why, at 26, he'd want to leave to challenge for honors. Real Madrid is ahead of Liverpool today. Facts are facts. Yes, Liverpool is a huge club. Yes, we're a great club that players should be honored to play at. But are we going to win the League in the next two years? If we get Champions League that'd be huge. And Madrid have that and so much more on offer. 

Torres left for Chelsea, and that I just could not forgive. And clearly it affected his mental stability. But Suarez going to Madrid? I understand it. Players at his level deserve that shot. And Madrid and Barca are top of the world for the Latin lads. It's like Utd, Arsenal and LFC for the English speaking countries. There's history there. 

I wouldn't sell him for a penny below 50 million pounds. But right there? We can do something with that and he's happy. We remove a massive talent but also a massive pain, while pocketing a huge sum, what more could you ask?

Loyalty? I understand why so many fans run to that, but its Suarez life. He deserves to have a go at league titles and Champions League glory while he's in his prime. And we aren't going to be a sure bet there for at least 3 years (if all goes well...). So I understand and don't begrudge him.

There are a couple of famous college libraries that I'm aware of - the [Wren Library](http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/index.php?pageid=350), designed by famous architect Christopher Wren (who also designed St Paul's Cathedral), and the library of [Samuel Pepys](http://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/pepys/), the famous diarist. Both of these libraries appear to be open to visitors in some fashion, but you'd probably have to email them to ask whether you can pop in.

Each department also has its own library - you might be able to get into the earth sciences one but it probably won't be that interesting TBH.

The second reason would be that the entire team can score goals and we haven't had an iconic forward for the team to work the ball to. We need someone who screams 'pass to me i'll score'. Other wise Hazard, Mata, Oscar, Lampard are all going to do what they've been doing for ages, shoot or find another midfielder to pass to.

1. This has been his breakout season. Before this he hasn't done much. 
2. This is in the dutch league. Full of talent, sure, but it's a gamble depending on his price. 
3. What's he worth? How much would you be willing to pay? What do you think the gap between those two numbers is?
4. Looks like his success has come from playing next to another striker in a 442. That won't be the case at Spurs.

Didn't say that at all.

&gt;Suarez's role changed drastically when Sturridge was brought in; he was able to play much deeper. 

Yes, because we had a striker. There was plenty of objection to him dropping deeper if you remember, seeing as he was our top scorer. We didn't buy Sturridge to free Suarez up, we bought Sturridge to take the goal burden off of Suarez.

&gt;The more skilful Coutinho was brought in and allowed Luis to play much more fluid, one touch football instead of trying to dribble around the entire defence.

I'm not sure which games you watched but Suarez barely changed at all. He certainly didn't stop trying to dribble around the entire defence.

You're suggesting we bought Sturridge and Coutinho to benefit Suarez? We didn't. Suarez drifts everywhere. It's impossible to construct a team around him as he's a wild card. For the most part he'll play where he can cause the most damage. Just like Gerrard said on Goals On Sunday, you just ""let him play.""

This my letter to my MP and if this helps you right to yours then that'd be fab

    Dear Dawn Primarolo,
 
    I hope you're well. 
   
    Today I write to you regarding the rather worrying state of the PRISM
    revelations that the USA has gone at lengths to (who is no doubt
    sharing the data they mine with the UK). 
 
    I hope you consider the kind of police state and destabilisation of
    democracy this presents. With the ability to wiretap anyone in the UK
    any MP's, police chiefs - anyone in position of power is now open to
    extortion. And there will be people/MPs/Police chiefs/local councillors
    in position of power and privilege that can now be affected by
    blackmail. The NSA knows who is having affairs, who's doing hard drugs,  
    who's in the closet and even who's a paedophile (that might sound far
    fetched if it weren't for the cover up by the BBC in the 70's/80's what
    with the Saville scandal etc.) 
 
    What's more this attitude of ""if you have nothing to fear you have
    nothing to hide"" rhetoric coming from William Hague is absolutely
    laughable! I always thought that phrase was a parody of a police state
    and am pretty darned shocked to hear it openly said! 
 
    I don't think the state should be intruding into peoples lives quite as
    deeply as what the PRISM project has obviously done. 
 
    I would urge you to push forward supporting the EU's law of ""Right to
    be forgotten"". 
 
    This example of British construction workers wrongly being blacklisted
    for up to 20 years is a prime example of what happens when people work
    in the shadows with no accountability.

This is the key point. It isn't that the proposals principle is inherently flawed. It is the list of what counts as a decent basis for using more rooms not being adequately widely scoped, and a lack of authority for councils to decide on an individual basis. Furthermore there should be financial assistance provided for social renters being forced to move. And, a requirement for a cost-benefit to be performed by the council to ensure they are saving money by moving individuals.

With that said. Individuals in similar case should not be so close to the debt line that this policy makes much of a difference. If disabled people can live in private sector housing with several hundreds of pounds each month to be funded themselves, someone in social housing should have even more money to spend from their benefit range.

Plus so many people are trapped in the low-wage/poor job security situation, or indeed have so many loan commitments, or just plain have to work every hour they can just to keep their heads above the water, that I think they feel unable to do anything, lest it jeopardize their precarious situation even further.

I know this much. Shit needs to change. We can't go on like this. Where does this end exactly if we don't?

Perhaps a run on the banks? Or we try to set up local cooperatives with local farmers to circumnavigate the big supermarkets?

Somerset has no particularly significant mineral deposits, does not sit at the junction of major commercial land routes and has no major ports. As a result no industries have developed, nor commercial centres, and it has remained largely rural. Since there has been no influx of industrial workers or immigrants from outside, the accent has remained comparatively static over time, when others – notably the major cities, including London (home of the BBC) – have changed far more quickly due to the mixing of accents and the rise of newly affluent merchants whose accent others then attempted to emulate.

The major change has been the loss of the rhotic “r” in standard Received Pronunciation - BBC – English. The counties of the southwest – Somerset among them – have retained this. This accent is, in many ways, a lot closer to the form of English that was spoken when the first colonists settled in the Americas (as Briggykins suggests), and many US accents have retained the rhotic “r”.

The RAF in 1944 dropped over 40% more ordinance successfully on targets than the USAAF . The biggest difference was that the Lancaster  and Halifax could carry 12,000lbs of ords 1,500 miles . A B17 and B24 who could only carry 3000lb of ords 1,200miles   and the Mosquito ""light bomber"" could carry 4,000lb 1,700 at a cruising speed of 340mph , so in the time a B17 did one mission over the Rhine with a load of 5,000 lb a single mosquito could have delivered 8,000lb with only a crew of 2 and not even have to worry about fighters attacking it .

While I am all for the law, I don't see why it is mentioned in your letter given the context. The EU law is for EU citizens with data in the EU. Which is not what the recent articles have been about. If you put your data on a US system then it comes under US law. Any EU law would not apply there unless you have some sort of intertangling business operation which would allow application in the same sort of way the patriot act can enter EU servers of US companies.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;The BR passing system also ensures lengthy amounts of time on the ball, leading to more chances and ultimately more goals scored.

Actually, I think the benefits of keeping possession are a little more nuanced than that. I suppose we all know that Rodgers worked with Mourinho (the latter has a very high opinion of Rodgers), and Mourinho was a big advocate of resting with possession as a way of allowing his teams to press high up the pitch. This is something that has really caught on in the last decade.

Obviously pressing high up the pitch is tiring, so the logic is that when the ball is won back the team aims to do little more than keep the ball so the players can have a short rest. They pass it to whoever is in space, which often ends up with the ball going backwards, sometimes right the way back to the goalkeeper. Fans often bemoan this, but fail to see that this passing strategy is what allows teams to play a pressing game. 

People often wonder how Barcelona players have the stamina to constantly press so tenaciously, but the answer is pretty simple: the players get a few minutes rest every time they win the ball back. Lets not forget that the opposition cannot score when you have possession as well, so keeping the ball is often one of the strongest defensive strategies.",0,1371029951,null,0,1371032919,0,cah9cq1,t3_1g5933,t1_cah9cq1,t1_cagwy6e,null,1430838227,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

&gt;Are Prism and other similar programmes aimed only at the data of US citizens and residents, or also – even primarily – at non-US nationals, including EU citizens?

It is aimed at everyone with no real distinction. Yes, that includes EU citizens.

&gt;Is access to, collection of or processing of data on the basis of Prism and other programmes … limited to specific and individual cases, and if so what criteria are applied?

No. It allegedly collects everything it can. However agencies with access to the data in other jurisdictions may have narrower scopes (as in the UK).

&gt;Is the data of individuals accessed, collected or processed in bulk (or on a very wide scale, without justification relating to specific individual cases) either regularly or occasionally?

Monitoring is both performed in bulk regularly, and targeted individually, depending on requirements.

&gt;Is the scope of these programmes restricted to national security or foreign intelligence or is it broader?

Its purpose is for national security. However would you be shocked if this data ever helped US businesses over their rivals?

&gt;What avenues, judicial or administrative, are available to companies in the US or the EU to challenge access to, collection of and processing of data under Prism or other programmes?

There is no avenue for an EU company to challenge a US law unless the company also operates within the US. If EU citizens wish to use US services then it is US laws which apply to their data. Companies in the US obviously have the full US legal system at hand to challenge decisions and information requests. Meanwhile if a US company has data in the EU, the Patriot Act allows the US Government to pressure this company into giving access to the data on its international systems. This often conflicts with the laws of the local jurisdiction, however the penalties for not complying with the PA will make compliance the most cost effective choice given options between, for example, EU Data Protection Directive fines, or US company shutdown.

&gt;What avenues are available to EU citizens to be told if they are affected by Prism or other similar programmes and how do they compare with those available to US citizens?

There are none for either citizens. Obviously however US citizens have their legal system, not that this will help much in notification prior to legal discovery.

&gt;What avenues are available to EU citizens or companies to challenge access to, collection of and processing of their personal data under Prism and similar programmes, and how does that compare with the rights of US citizens?

Targeting largely uncharacterised proteins is really really dangerous as there is so little knowledge of the cascades that can occur and animal models just aren't similar enough to risk trialling in humans so early on.

Recreational drugs are well established at not killing people right away, yeah they're dangerous and have numerous side effects, but the number of people that take them is often significantly greater than drug trials for new drugs. There may be compounds that can assist with treatment and small doses of the drugs could be incredibly beneficial. My instinct is that lobbying groups don't want this to happen because they can't patent the drugs and if, for example, it turns out that MDMA is a fantastic treatment for depression where anti-depressants can make thinks much worse well, that's their business model fucked.

(On a side note, in my opinion, drug companies are making the mistake of tech companies in the dot com bust; outsourcing far too much. I doubt their business model of research-&gt;patent for 20 years is sustainable for too much longer into the future.

Yes you will bump into drunk/rowdy people but the general rule is if you're not looking for a fight then you'll be fine.  I've lived here 30 years and never had trouble.

Generally, all the bars on Broad St are much of a muchness, all play commercial cheesy pop and dance.  All the 'brand names' are located on Broad St too, including Walkabout, Reflex, Lloyds, O'Neills etc. Also PopWorld which has recently opened.

Brindley Place which is just off Broad St has more relaxed style bars for a pre-drink, but again is full of name brands and nothing really independent.  You'll find Pitcher and Piano, All Bar One, Slug and Lettuce etc. 

If you're looking for something a bit more alternative then there's plenty more options which will give you a feel for Birmingham.   In the City Centre you can check out The Victoria, Island Bar, Sun on the Hill or Sunflower Lougne for a 'cool' indie vibe.  If you like rock/metal then Subside or Scruffy Murphys may be your preferred choice. If you like Real Ale then check out The Wellington or Post Office Vaults for probably the best selection in town.

The Arcadian (Top of Hurst St) is similar to Broad St but a bit more funky. (Women are a bit more orange) music here will be more dance/house rather than chart/cheese.  

Hurst St (Gay Quarter) can be quite fun if you're not adverse to gay bars.  One of the bonuses here, is the bars generally don't charge to get in and are open til 4am. (clubs will charge) 

Digbeth, about 5 mins out of the city is home to a lot more alternative music nights, including drum and base, dubstep, and more grimey stuff.  Somewhere like The Rainbow would be the best place to get started.  The Spotted Dog in digbeth is a great pub too with an awesome garden!

No

&gt;What I see from the news etc. is that the economy is dying, 

The economy has been better, but we're no where near in the state of places like Greece or Spain.

&gt;the people are going feral (especially the immigrants)

I have no idea what you mean by 'feral', and the immigrants are not doing it, whatever it is.

&gt;and that the whole place is spiraling into collapse.

It isn't.

&gt;I have always thought very highly of the British, but recently they seem to be losing something.

I've lost my keys, have you seen them?

&gt;I don't think this is limited to the UK, but I had always thought the the British people were more resilient than this. I know that the UK has had terrible problems with immigration (a flaw in societal design IMO). I think that the UK should have sealed off its borders years ago

You don't live here, nobody cares for your racist little rants.

&gt;How true is this?

Not at all 

&gt;And is it the whole of the UK, or just England? How are Scotland, Wales, and Ireland doing?

The same as England - just fine.

true,hotcod,null,null,"There's two different questions here. 

The first is simple, do you put your product out for free? 

Well your product can and likely is going to be out there for free if it's at all popular, this is because your product is infertility reproducible at marginal costs and it makes charging for accesses stupid economically and all but impossible to enforce. The upshot is that the people who are paying for your product are doing so because they *want* to not because they *have* to and the people not paying for your product are still people who would not be paying for your product regardless of it they have it or not.  

The answer then is that there are only two viable choices, either pay what you like (or a free and paid version) or sell it but don't pay any mind to enforcing the copyright because it's a waste of your time. The first I think is going to become more important because in the new economy it's not shifting units that is going to matter it's going to be making fans. Fans who will want to find ways to support you and who you can leverage in terms of crowd funding. Fans are also open to paying more for things that are limited, your time, special limited editions, physical products and so on. 

Now the first option is currently a lot more useful in the music space than the others and tends not be something big companies can really go at in that vein but spending time money and effort worrying about pirates instead of your consumers is idiotic anywhere.

The second question however is different this is the question of if you put out your work for free do you allow for others to commercialise that work? 

Turning a blind eye to people making a copy is something I think most people are starting to accept as the nature of things these days but if those people then profit from the work they copied? That's still far more touchy. This is the reason creative commons exist at all rather than people simply pushing work out in to the public domain and there's a large question over if CC is going to end up hurting more than it helps in regards to the big questions.

That said however it has it's uses. My band is gearing up to put out our first EP and the plan is to put it out for free with a ""pay more if you like"" option and I should be able to get my band to agree to using a CC non commercial attribution license but they would never agree to either public domain or a licence that allows for commercial work.

Which is sad, we are on a limited budget and I'm actually putting together the EP's artwork using images that are under CC licences that allow *for* commercial work. 

All in all the economics of the market have been changed by technology and the market will adjust as a result. Far from being the end of the world it's lead to more people making more money out of creative arts than **any other time in history**. When you hear stories of dumb and gloom from the big industry lobbies they are talking (and often outright lying) about themselves. Which is why the are willing to do stupid shit like this that has huge, dangerous implications for far far more important things. They are willing to burn the whole thing down rather than adapt to it because the new reality is of massive redistribution of the power and wealth within the market away from them and spread out to more creative people than ever.    

If we can make it through the death throes of these giants we are looking at an age of unparalleled creativity and expression in which more people can making a living from what they love to do. The down side is that these death throes threaten to destroy that future and worse undermine fundamental freedoms. 

A free and open web is, in the end, vastly more important than the established  entertainment industry. An industry it's become clear we don't even need to provide us entertainment.

It still comes down to punishing people for having cars without giving them a viable alternative mode of transport. If people *want* to walk or cycle, then fine, but you should let everyone choose, not treat them like naughty school children and say they have ""excuses"" for not wanting to cycle/walk (all the mayor ever says is 'why don't you get on your bike').

I also feel that the process has not been at all democratic. The mayor has arbitrarily decided that this is something *he* wants to do, and has imposed it on everyone. Isn't he supposed to put it to all the Councillors, to have them agree or disagree? It also hasn't had any public consultation. People are only allowed to give an opinion 6 months after it's imposed on their area. I also don't like how he's obviously being influenced by his daughter, who runs a group about kids playing on the street, so is also anti-car. There is no flexibility in the scheme for, say, people who's job is to help the elderly in their home and so have to travel a lot during the day. The business permit rates are also far too high. It's like he doesn't want business in Bristol. 

Not everyone is covered under Blue Badge. What about older people who are less mobile but not considered disabled? What about people like myself who suffer from horrific pain but are not considered disabled? I assume that to get a blue badge you need to submit evidence of being in receipt of a disability benefit, and we all know what the government is doing with that, so it's hardly likely that many people would be covered. 

I don't agree with all forms of car ownership. I don't think people should have people carriers or 4x4s unless they're disabled or actually use the 4x4 for farm work etc. I don't think people should have more than 2 cars. But there's nothing wrong with a household having 1 or 2 small, fuel efficient cars. It's not for the mayor to say how people should live their lives and travel. I feel like the whole thing has slipped from encouraging people to cycle/use buses, to ""OMG you have a car, I'm going to make your life as difficult as possible"".

I am not usually a fan of the slippery slope argument but in the case of government surveillance I believe it is totally valid. Be it over the course of decades or centuries our actions will become more restricted as government becomes more powerful and less democratic through schemes such as PRISM. The *only* way to prevent this is to nip it in the bud and spread awareness of the danger our rights are in.

Honestly, only looking out for yourself will only take you so far. You are correct in that while it is a sad truth, it is true that when it comes to digital rights simply unaware or uneducated. In general even, much of the general public particularly in the UK are simply apathetic to politics, particularly younger people. But if mass disagreement over these schemes is not shown, nothing will change. Worse than that, they will grow until methods of protecting privacy such as the ones you linked are not enough - or worse, illegal. That sound silly, but honestly, give it half a century and can't you see a possible push for no one being able to hide themselves from government - yet again under the utterly absurd concept of ""nothing to fear, nothing to hide?"".

**Bike: Honda CBR 125**

**Year: 2004**

**Bought for: £900 (2011)**

**Sold for: £800 (2013)**

A good little bike if you're not too tall. At 5'11 I fit quite nicely and at 10st4 the engine never had too much trouble pulling me along. It's great for city traffic but dual carriageways are best avoided. Depending on modifications (something I find is pretty common for CBR125's) you're unlikely to get much more than 70 out of the poor thing. Off the mark it's pretty quick, getting to 50 in an impressive time - after that however, the power falls off and you're left clawing your way up to anything quicker. 

Riding comfort isn't too bad - if you plan on riding for more than an hour at a time I'd recommend investing in some extra seat padding. Riding position is going to be up-right unless you're 4'2.

As for build quality, I was bloody impressed. In the two years and 6000 miles I had the bike for, I did little more than light servicing (oil, fluids, tyres, chain etc). A good point about the bike is if the battery dies, it's nice and easy to bump start! (Something I did lots when I was a poor student who couldn't afford a new battery)

The bike is, more than anything, fun. It's nippy enough for the city, small enough to squeeze through traffic and fast enough to enjoy a winding country road.

Position wise he is an AM, he could play all 3 spots in a 4-2-3-1 quite well but I personally think at his age he would be amazing in a very offensive 4-3-3, something like:

Ceballos - Dembele - Holtby

Lennon - Ade - Bale.

Ceballos, like Coulibaly has the potential to be amazing and so spurs need to make sure they nurture him PERFECTLY. No 1 year loans to the middle of nowhere to stunt progress (like Mason). I personally can't think of a PL team that would suit him (probably not up to the level of Swansea) and so would rather see him continue to acclimatize to the UK playing in the U-21 with a handful of appearances off of the bench this year. Playing style wise he reminds me of Huddlefro wearing Lampards boots. It is quite amazing just how well he can ping balls around the park but his knack for scoring goals (talking about positioning when entering the box as a midfielder) looks a lot like Lampard (who is in my opinion the best in the world at this). To top it all off he has those Spanish fancy feet rivalled only by Pritchard in the U-21s.

He just turned 20 and realistically (pessimists add one year to these) could be a squad player within 1 year and a starter in 2 (Dembele -&gt; Holtby -&gt; Carroll -&gt; Ceballos in my opinion for those front spots, lucky that he can feature off of the bench for striker/LW/RW however). He needs to see time off of the bench this season (whether it be in the FA cup, Capital one cup, EL or League) in order to keep progressing at the capacity I think he can.

If my suspicions are correct that spurs have invested heavily in youth so that they don't need to dip heavily into the transfer market over the next half a decade to help fund the stadium then I can see Ceballos becoming a crucial player for spurs, something like:

Walker (28) - Caulker (26) - Vertonghen (30)(C) - Fryers (25)

---------------------- Sandro (29)

---------------- Ceballos (25) - Carroll (26)

It doesn't sound silly at all actually.  Strong encryption at one time actually was (practically) illegal in the US at least.  It may be that the only reason it became available to use for privacy was because it also happens to enable e-commerce.

Also, it is actually the case that we cannot legally keep secrets from the government in the UK and this has been the case for about 10 years now.  Police can require that encryption keys are divulged, and this overrides even the right to silence.  Failure to divulge a key gets you 10 years in prison.  The only thing we have really is plausible deniability, something that PGP does not provide.

So in fact you are right.  Something needs to happen at both ends.

Torres/Suarez next inline Couthino. 

They get paid well to do a job and then move on when it suits them.

When a player has shown loyalty such as carra/stevie/agger by staying over many years when other clubs could have offered them more, give them back this loyalty. 

Other than that, I support the players when they are at liverpool because they play for the club I love. When they no longer want to be here I just want as much money as the club can get for them.

Torres was an amazing player for Liverpool and I loved having him at the club. When he went I no longer cared what he did. ( was quite happy to see him do crap )

Tl; dr   In modern football loyalty is a one way street ( fans to players ) Support the team. Players come and go. Deal with it.

true,iansharam,AU,australia,"**After his first season at Chelsea how do you feel has lived up to his hype coming into the season**

I think he started out amazingly as he was expected to impress everybody from the very beginning and that's exactly what he did, you can't really expect a 21/22 year old to keep that kind of form over 60+ matches. His form may have dipped a little as the season went on, but he still showed his flashes of brilliance and showed what he was capable of.

**13 Goals and 20 Assists do you think he can beat it, and maybe has he said himself get closer to the tallies that Messi and C.Ronaldo is showing?**

Anyone that comes over from a league like Ligue 1 will have a tough time adapting to the physicality of the league but watching him play was always exciting. I'm hoping that mourinho guides him into becoming a more direct player, I think he should take a few more shots than what he did this season. If he keeps going at the rate he's going at, he should reach the kind of form Ronaldo showed at United.

**As many of us has discussed over the season do you think he will stay at chelsea for a long time or try to move onto, perhaps Spain and Real Madrid/Barcelona in a few years?**

It depends on how Mourinho guides us, if he turns us into the team we have the potential to be then I think he will stay into his late 20's and maybe later. If he left for anybody it would be for Madrid I think.

**Many people claims that Eden has the potential to become a Ballon d'or winner in the future. How far do you guys think he can go?**

He's shown us all that his potential is incredible, that game against West Ham had me on the edge of my seat every time he would get the ball. I think he is definitely future balon d'or winner, especially if we become the team that we can be under Mourinho.

He can shoot from long range with power or use finesse. He has all the ingredients to be a star, maybe not reach the goal tallies of Ronaldo or Messi but I like his confidence in at least aiming for that.

What I also like about him, is you get the feeling some games he could dribble around a player if he had to, but he does try one twos, he isn't overly selfish.

true,urkspleen,present,Frank Lampard,"I think this is a great idea. Are we going to do this for the whole squad? That would occupy us quite nicely.

1. The good thing about the Hazard hype was that (to my knowledge) no one was making specific predictions about what he'd achieve, only that he'd be really good. Thankfully, he was *really* good. I don't think there's a team in the world that he wouldn't deserve a starting spot in. He's really fun to watch, and when on form is very effective. He's been criticized for being inconsistent, the biggest factor therein being his drop in form mid-season. For me, this claim is a little unfair. It seems like for the first few matches he was scoring, assisting, and winning penalties every game. The penalties were never going to happen every game, and probably inflated people's expectations. The scoring wasn't that consistent, though the slump in form of the entire team mid-year definitely contributed to that. In the meantime, he still made some assists and contributed. Overall, a strong first season.

2. He can absolutely beat 13 goals and 20 assists (particularly goals). It's great that he has that ambition, but it remains to be seen whether or not he can score that many. I'll guess that he can get close to what Ronaldo did when he played for Man U. 

3. This one's hard. I think that it ultimately depends on how it goes under Mourinho. If Mourinho stays for a long time as he's suggested and is consistently successful, than Hazard will be here for years to come. If not, I'm worried that he might jump ship with a year or two left on his contract. 

4. I agree he has the potential to be a Ballon d'or winner. If a lot of details turn out right, than he may become the best. I don't think it's likely that he will ever be quite on the level of Messi, but he could get close realistically.",0,1371040076,null,0,false,0,cahawsu,t3_1g6ueg,t1_cahawsu,t3_1g6ueg,null,1430837421,38,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,38

true,SirMuttley,cnty-uk,British in Bangkok,"&gt; it seems you don't even understand basics of inferring information, and are clearly so stupid you think ""Notifying 3 separate occasions"" could mean 3 text messages 5 minutes before the meal.

Reading not really your thing? I asked questions. I made no statements. How were they notified? The school doesn't say. They could have said ""we spoke to the parents 3 times"", but it doesn't instead it uses a word like ""notify"". Notification is the giving of information, it doesn't mean the information was also received (you're just incorrectly inferring that). So it's quite possible that notification was given via SMS, email or voice mail. You just want to infer that it wasn't because it makes your rage seem justified. Again, the school doesn't say how long before the meal the notification was sent. So surely it's a reasonable question to ask? Was it within an hour? Was it within a day? If the school sent emails at the start of the school day to the parents then it's quite reasonable that the parents had not received them. But we don't know.

The problem with all the inferences you're making is you're just using your bias to infer what you want. Rather than asking questions. Rather than infer the answers, I'd like to know the real answers. But I guess that's where we're different, you're happy filling in the gaps with what you'd like to believe happened.

No actually the school doesn't.  Free School meals are a means tested benefit, which not everyone is eligable for.  This means that for a school to pay for someone who's parents haven't settled the account they would have to cut in to money that is intended for teaching children.

Personally, I think it would be far better if schools simply fed all children in the same way, this would mean children on free meals would not be stigmatised, and a lot of money could be no doubt saved in the buerocratic system surrounding them.

Added to this the number of newly trained pilots  was also increased . Pilots from reserve groups such as 10 and 9 group were rotated into 11 and 12 group .  The RAF was winning the BoB by 2:1 over German aircraft shot down and of the pilots lost only 30% were killed or wounded the vast majority being rescued or only out of combat for a week  . 

The FW 190D6 was a much better aircraft than the P-51D  and was better than the P47D-11 used in the ET .  the whole FW190 family was pretty much the plane to be feared having better turning and rolling ability than  both the P51D and P47D . The only aircraft that could compete with the FW190D series was the clipped win Spitfire Mk IX HFe at altitude and the MkIX LFe (or XVI with the packard merlin 266) . Of note the Me262 was only fater than the Gloster Meteor but was not as stable a gun package or turned as well though they never got to fight .   

Air supremacy over France was archived in late 1941 with the Raider missions set up by the RAF while the German border was off limits due to rang of RAF fighters .   

As far as smart way of fighting the USA method was throw numbers and the enemy will run out of bullets . Just looking at the losses of the 8th airforce in it's first 3 months of opperations in ET your looking at over 20,000 aircrew lost due to not listening to the RAF's bomber commands  advice .  At D-Day they refused to use the British Funnies that would have cleared the beach of obstructions , destroyed pill boxes with ease and stopped other armour from becoming stuck in the soft sand .  The British generals also advised the US forces to not bother taking some towns in Normandy  but instead to hold back and surround the towns forcing the pockets to surrender (a tactic used in North Africa to great effect) .  Yet when large amount of aggression was required some US generals were found lacking ( the landings in central Italy designed to break Montecasino for example) . General Eisenhower even said of that operation : "" when I wanted a tiger I got a pussy cat"" . The worst unnecessary loss of US forces was perhaps the landings at Sicily which were a complete botch with US ships shelling their own forces on the beach , head long rushes into machine gun kill zones instead of using the natural terrain to instigate an effective pincer . This one action is thought to have caused the US general inchage of the Italian landing in support to Montecasino to   be as slow and lack the aggression that was required .

A lot of the government money comes with legally binding strings attached, for example they can't spend money that is part of the olympic legacy on something which isn't part of an approved sports program.

It is not the schools job to be a social services soup kitchen.  We might want it to be, but if we do, we need to vote that way.  As mentioned above I am heavily in favour of a universal benefit were every child is suitably fed.  However as it is today, it isn't the schools choice that they are not to do so.

The only people to blame here, are the parents.  They also removed the child from a school over something as trivial as this?  10 years ago when running an afterschool club at a local school (part funded by my uni) I was told my kids hadn't had any lunch, due to a power cut, the kitchen hadn't been working.  Some had gone home that day, many had not.  I guess I am saying it is not unusual for someone to starve for 8 hours, it will happen when something bad happens.

From my own personal experiance and that which I've seen during my volenteering time, I would suggest moving schools can be a very truamatic experiance for children, been taken away from friends always is.

However, after being put to a vote, ongoing concerns about a possible link between the beauty of a grass verge and the number of road traffic accidents has resulted in the 20mph speed limit proposal being extended to all roads across Nottinghamshire.

That's the key point. We have no idea *where* our data is stored. Using a UK gmail? Oh, yeh *must* be a UK server.

The point is, if I send a letter through fed-ex, I *know* it never left the UK so was always subject to UK law.

We are meant to be allies so we assumed that we weren't a target. But now that GCHQ has been accessing our data through PRISM even if legally, it meant the US can, and presumably have, been reading our data.

Arguably, the US has been spying on UK civilians and officials. In the past they would have had to literally breach our sovereignty to do so. But now they can do it safe from the reach of UK laws.

It does seem vague. I doubt there was a specific reason apart from stopping people protesting. They cleared out a squat because they suspected there would be offensive weapons. I am not sure what counts as offensive weapons, but everyone has offensive weapons in their kitchen.

Shit suspension, particularly at the front, but can be sorted with varying amounts of time and money. Tyre and chain life seems good so far. Engine is supposedly bullet proof but the cranks runs plain bearings (shells) and the whole deal is dependent on good oil pressure - change it at least every 3K (4 litres worth!) and try not to let it get too far down the sight glass. They can also drink absurd amounts - a litre in a thousand miles is not uncommon if used hard! Poor headlight despite being 55w halogen.

I would argue its a technical design issue rather than a legal one (peer to peer rather than centralised server). To solve the issue you imply, we would require an organisation capable of implementing laws on an international level. I see no issue with countries having their own laws and implementing them on areas under their jurisdiction, however unpalatable they may be, for that is what sovereignty is about.

She's at college, her boyfriend can only find part time work and her sister is on ESA for mental health issues so they are entitled to Housing Benefit.

My daughter gave the council all her sisters details again and week later gets a letter from the council saying they are stopping her housing benefit since they have no proof of her sisters income. 

Fast forward eight weeks.  My daughter has given the council proof of her sisters benefits **three times**, and each time they have lost them.  She's now being threatened with court action for eviction and the local council are at least eight weeks behind with claims thanks to every other man and his dog being in the same boat.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Guys,

&gt;I am getting a significant amount of disapproval on PRISM related subjects when I am being overtly factual in nature. Since I am rarely actually given a response I've deduced that this is likely based on emotion and poor reddiquette.

&gt;I don't know how people are interpreting the data released by the media thus far, but it seems some of you have got the wrong end of the stick.

&gt;It essentially comes down to this. PRISM, is a US system operating within the bounds of US law (take that for what you will). It does not operate in the UK, as that would be a clear violation of our sovereignty. It seems that some of you think that EU servers are automagically added to this system. Which I agree, would be abhorrent. But, it just simply is not the case (under most situations described in comments so far).

It may be within the bounds of US law, but it's only within US law because it's designed to target anybody not from the USA (e.g us)

&gt;Your first counterpoint maybe, for example, 'well, when I tell all my reddit friends I need a shit though the messaging system, that is logged in PRISM and that is just not right'. But what you have to understand is, Reddit is a US service and as such is subject to US laws. It does not need to pay any attention whatsoever to EU laws. PRISM may well operate on it, and as far as US laws go, that is absolutely fine. The US is not monitoring our internet connections, or recording our (UK2UK) landline telephone calls.

The issue is, we don't know this. We don't know how this system is doing it's intercepts. They may be working in US company owned DC's (such as Google) that are physically based in the UK. Traffic heading towards Australia pases possibly through the USA. Is that being intercepted too?

&gt;Why do you think we should have any say on how the US treats data in gathers from geographically US servers?

Take Google for example, they geographically load-balance their services. We don't know where at any time any data is (I don't think Google do either). Even EU centric data could be resting in USA DC's. 

&gt;Yes. We have organisations like GCHQ which have been allowed access to this system (which personally, I think a US citizen should be more concerned about, than us). And they make specific (and very limited) requests for data on UK threats. It is again worth repeating, that the data it will get access too would be data a Briton has intentionally placed on a US system, not a British/EU one (usually).

How do we know what these requests are and how large they are? They could be asking for access to a cosntant stream of info..which is ""1 request""

&gt;We collectively get annoyed when the US meddles in our affairs. Yet here we are critiquing theirs and demanding our government pressure them to make changes.

So they should be doing, Goverments should constantly critique each other. Especially allies.

&gt;I will however admit there is a slight complication. And that concerns the US FISA and Patriot Act, which allows the US Government to pressure US companies into giving them access to data they deem relevant for national security. These acts state for example, that a US corporate server hosted in the UK can have its data exfiltrated to US authorities, regardless of our law. This is of a concern for example, to users of Office 365, Gmail, Facebook, etc, who have EU operations hosted within the EU but are US companies. However there has been no indication as of yet that this provision has been added to PRISM. I really must stress however, that a UK company operating within the EU is absolutely not effected by this. And as such any data you put on their EU servers is not subject to any of these issues.

Do remember so far all we have seen of PRISM is very limited, we know not much of the technical/political building blocks

1) The hype surrounding him coming into the season was pretty big! I think he's lived up to it to an extent. He is young so he still has his best years ahead of him. The flashes of brilliance we've seen this year show great promise. If he can go the whole season without hitting the slump he did this season about mid way, there's no doubt he can be great. Not that he already isn't.

2) Whether he can match Ronaldo and Messi is yet to e seen. Like I said, he is young. He has time to get there but nothing is for sure. He can definetly be a world class winger. He is very close to reaching that. I think under Mourinho, he can get there and for sure beat his scoring tally and assists from last season.

Where I live, for example, there is a large grass play area that would be too large for the community to cut, but there is also a large number of small grass verges that would only take a few minutes each to mow.

I really suspect that you're wrong on this.

Just look at Portugal.  Decriminalisation has got more people into treatment, cut HIV rates amongst drug users, cut drug use amongst children and cut a whole mess of non-violent addicts who are harming no-one but themselves out of the criminal justice system.

Sure, more people try drugs, and a lot of the effects it's had on the death rate have rebounded (back to almost pre-decriminalisation levels), but it's still vastly better than it was before.

2) Again, under Mou, I def. think he can beat the tally. I'm predicting 18-25 goals and 25-30 assists next season.

3) He looks to be fitting in quite well with the guys, and with the addition of some Belgium players I think he will be there for a long time. He said he feels at home, so I hope he's here to stay.

4) I think it's in his future, but added pressure like that can deter some players. I dont want a Messi or Ronaldo, I want Hazard to be Hazard. He will play into his own skill set and many trophies will come our way. Winning the Europa was great for a lot of our younger guys.

Yes everybody can track the transactions, including who the money went to and from.

While you are in (sole) possession of the corresponding private key you can prove that you are that individual, but unless you choose to also reveal your real-world identity then there's no way for someone else to choose to make this association.

Of course a problem with this is that you could accidentally reveal your real-world identity when you verify your bitcoin identity; for example this might happen if you do it by some channel that reveals your IP address. (There are lots of problems with finding the person with a given IP address, but if you want to be anonymous this is probably more information that you'd want to reveal.)

Something big will happen in our lifetimes, without some currently unindicated actions or events. And things aren't stable as is. Have a list;


It has been argued that there's a 'youth bulge' worldwide which has been a destabilising factor globally. Having a large number of unemployed or underemployed young people (especially young men) has been theorised to lead to increased unrest.


Water tables are falling worldwide. We're using water from natural aquifers faster than they naturally refill, and 'fossil water' which is from sources that do not refill. This could lead to more widespread water stress, which drives conflicts and causes famine. Population growth doesn't appear to have peaked, and it is highest amongst the poorest and least developed nations in the world. And international financiers are now allowed to speculate on food, exacerbating the problem of efficient or even fair distribution of food as the price spikes wildly in a volatile market.


We have built a civilisation that needs cheap energy to continue as is, and a society that apparently requires infinite expansion to not be 'a disaster'. Our cheap energy is largely sourced from nonrenewable sources, and to expect infinite growth on finite resources (both fuel and other resources in consideration here) is patently unsustainable. If we do not change these core concepts, eventually we will hit a hard limitation.


Taking the leap from fuel, most prediction models are putting the global situation for climate change closer and closer to 'tipping point' scenarios where global climate change will be likely and to a point where the situation is irreversible. Climate change means more extreme weather, leading to less reliable food sources. Food pressure causes conflict. There's a damning scientific consensus that anthropogenic global warming is a thing, and we simply aren't taking the drastic action needed to prevent it.


Internationally, the situation is the same as always. We can pretend we're all friends, but we're not. Nations act in their own interests, first above all else. All the large powers still spy on each other. Still regard each other with fear and suspicion. It's clear that the USA regards both Russia and China as 'foes', and I'm sure it's mutual. The issue really is that regional instability has given some public exposure of these hostilities. China and Russia clearly don't want to allow interventions, especially in states that support them. I don't blame them, given the history of Western interventions. Deadlocking over these matters renders the UN impotent. Meanwhile, in attempts to toe the line on official support, all parties resort to the cold war era practices of manoeuvring through third parties, free agents, armed militias that can't be linked. Which has always worked out really well in the past. China hasn't been supporting so much in this fashion. China has been buying rights, buying minerals, dominating resources, fostering trade with South America and the rest of Asia. The largest mineral extraction rights sales in the world now are going to Chinese companies, despite the locations themselves being in Australia. Hilariously, this is like the USA's attempts to encircle Asia with it's own economic beneficiaries. And it's quite obvious that this makes US administrations anxious. And at home, Russia looks like it is slipping badly, into a very conservative socially inhibitive dictatorship, under a leader who has to appear strong to his people. Leaders that have to be strong to appeal domestically can be unfortunately belligerent on the world stage.


At home, there's a stripping down of rights. More surveillance, more police powers, more tracing, more analysis. The state gains more powers to watch what you do. IT allows them to data mine vast data sets for patterns (what the USA is doing with prism), to know who interacts with whom, and how much, for how long. New convenient ways to do everything makes you easier to trace, to keep watch over, and keep under control. New police powers here in the UK are very worrying. Secret courts? Longer detentions without charge? The people in the squat planning on demonstrating vs G8 - Some of them were arrested for ""Refusing to remove a face covering"". That worries me, and it should worry you, too. Covering your face shouldn't be a crime. Especially when we know the police 'round up known troublemakers' ahead of major events. Is it up to the police and the state to decide what constitutes 'trouble', and arrest people in advance? We should be worried that we can only protest by appointment, in approved 'Protest zones' as opposed to the 'NO TERROR ZONES' set up around anything one might want to protest.


Meanwhile corporations, going international, have become greater than states. Larger, richer, entities with no accountability are now beyond the control of single states, or, basically, anyone. They abuse international laws. They often break the laws.

That way there's no argument the parents could have and they have to take on sole responsibility for the child if they don't pay up.

Not only that, but we are going to be in for a battle to keep our most important players- at least one of which we are sure to lose. Even keeping them all, our first team is not that much better on paper than the likes of Newcastle, Fulham, Sunderland, Stoke, Swansea etc. who are are going to have to beat to be a top half side next season. 

Whilst I agree we need to bring in quality (Hadley is one name I mentioned), we also need to pad out the team with cheap, smaller names who can come in and do a job when asked; especially in the early round of cup competitions or around New Year when fixture congestion gets crazy- and I for one think that players like Alcaraz are perfect for that. 

No, he is not world class, and no he probably won't get that many run outs in the League over the course of the season. But he is pretty solid, and was the only good thing about the Wigan defence in 11/12.

I think there are Everton fans who are slightly delusional about our position in football. We are not too big, or important to have players like him in our team- we are in fact pretty desperate, and getting those players who are on a free transfer and mixing them up with younger lads with potential such as Stones is going to be absolutely vital for the future of our club.

My point is, that for bitcoin to ever become useful and not just a nerdgasm, you have to be able to exchange bitcoins for real world services, goods or other currencies. And as the mining of coins becomes ever more difficult, more people will find their only access to the market is to buy them using real cash.

true,CageChicane,lfc12,,"&gt;We didn't buy Sturridge to free Suarez up, we bought Sturridge to take the goal burden off of Suarez.

That is a contradictory sentence.
Suarez was being forced to play as a pure #9 which is not his best position. Sturridge allowed for him to play deeper, in the space behind the midfield and backline. This allowed Suarez to take on defenders at speed which is his greatest attribute. That's called building a team around someone.

&gt;I'm not sure which games you watched but Suarez barely changed at all.

Its clear you do not have a football mind. As soon as Coutinho was on the pitch, Luis was able to play brilliant one-touch build up play. Luis has a world class first touch, but he wasn't able to use it in the first half of the season because no one was there to combo off of. Taking the ball deeper, with a super-skilled midfielder like Coutinho, completely changed the way the team built up counter attacks. Instead of relying on Suarez to dribble it all the way in, the team starting playing brilliant one-touch passing.

&gt;Suarez drifts everywhere

That's the point. Its a fluid offensive system, highlighted with a world class player. LFC plays a very possession heavy system under BR, that allows Luis to not get locked in a single role to limit his effectiveness. This is the best possible system for Luis to play in...i.e. building a team around him.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I think he is very aware of what we've done to stand by him.  the way he's behaving, openly courting Real, is frustrating.  But it just seems right in line with his personality.  There's a bit of recklessness about it that just smacks of Suarez.  I hope he gets his brain in line and shuts up about it for a while now that he's made his desires clear.  I also really don't think he wants to leave for any reasons that involve the club directly.  In fact he has reiterated a couple of times not that he loves the club, players, and supporters, but wants to protect his family.  He must be getting worn out by it all now too.  It's like the kid in school who does something stupid and everyone makes fun of him.  It doesn't seem to bother him for a long time but they just don' stop poking at him and eventually he's just had enough.

Suarez has dug himself into an incredible hole with the media that he can't get out of, and there isn't much the club can do to help either.  His public image in England is just destroyed and it seems like there's quite a few twats who think it's ok to berate and insult him around his family when he's out and about (that story about the picture with his family where they all make biting gestures in front of his daughter comes to mind) which, combined with his portrayal in the media now, is making for a pretty hostile environment for his wife and daughter.  Yes, he made the mistakes that led to this kind of treatment, but you can't blame him for wanting to protect his family from it.  I'd want to get out of there for my daughter's sake too if I was in his position.

If he stays then he'll play his heart out for us again, he always will.  If he goes then it's a shame he felt like he had to leave, but also very understandable given what he probably deals with every time he tries to go out in public.

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","I have a regular experience on 3 lane motorways at night, where I'm on cruise control at a speedo-indicated 70 MPH (which GPS tells me is around 69 MPH in my car - previous car would have indicated 75 MPH at a GPS verified 69 MPH) in the left-most lane; the right hand two lanes have a steady sprinkling of vehicles overtaking me (both lanes travelling much faster than me - at least 80 MPH if not much more), but we're not talking dense traffic. I catch up on a slower moving driver (generally around 5 MPH difference, so well within the bounds of differing speedo accuracies - he may also be on cruise control at a speedo-indicated 70 MPH) who's cruising in the middle lane.

I end up with two choices, neither of them good:

 * Stay in lane and illegally undertake this driver. Hopefully they're paying attention and won't collide with me as I'm undertaking them, and I'll get away with the manoeuvre.
 * Move out two lanes, overtake them, move back in two lanes. This has the problem that the sprinkling of traffic that wants to overtake *me* also wants to be in the rightmost lane, as it wants to overtake me and the guy I've caught up on. As a result, the right hand lane gets rather crowded, with some drivers tailgating and trying to intimidate people into getting out of their way so they can go back to their crazy high speeds.

If the middle lane driver kept left, as I had been doing until I caught up on them, I would have to move out by one lane. The drivers I displace would have to join the lunatics in the rightmost lane, but because I'm not part of that mess, there are fewer drivers being displaced into the rightmost lane, and thus the lunatics get less upset about having to slow from their stupid speeds.

Now, it's the lunatics trying to do stupid speeds that create the danger; however, the ""middle lane hog"" has made the danger worse - instead of having a small time period where the lunatics are being forced to slow down so that they can move out one lane and overtake both the slower ""hog"" and me, there's a longer period where they cannot overtake either of us, but have to wait for me to finish overtaking the hog.",0,1371055033,null,0,false,0,cahfo9t,t3_1g1nld,t1_cahfo9t,t1_cag8ifb,null,1430835175,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;I did some research recently into how players that score in the Championship usually do when they move to the Premier League, and I was surprised that they usually keep about 80% of their stats after a move. If you take 80% of Ince’s totals for last season, you’d wind up with 14G/11A, which is basically what Theo Walcott produced. Except Ince is three years younger and has a good chance to be better than Walcott. Players that produce numbers like that at such an early age usually grow up into being superstars.

I'd be willing to bet that *if* Suarez leaves, then Ince will certainly get more interest from us.

true,Himinahomina,alt1,Ryan Ledson Hypetrain,"While your right about us reaching a glass-ceiling that appears to only be broken by money, you can't pre-judge the outcomes of the new manager when he just started two weeks ago.

* Obviously losing Moyes and Weir look set to be a blow but Neville's job was seemingly taken over by Jags for the last 6 months of the year and so the transition there you would assume to be a smooth one and who knows whether he'll stay at Everton in a coaching role. Steve Round is an unknown quantity as little is reported on the man so who's to know who replaces his position, whether it be someone outside the club or promoted from within.

* In regards to battling for players, we've had to do that for all of Moyes' tenure. Arteta was a battle, Rooney was a battle and Pienaar was a battle. All of our best players get pinched but we've replaced and grew as a side following each of their departures.

* Our team may appear weak to you on paper but it's the best it's been since Moyes took over. Big names don't matter if they don't perform and to say Sunderland, Stoke, Fulham and Newcastle have better first XI's than us is absurd. Swansea are closing the gap but we're still that much better than them; 17 points better.

* We've tried to pad the team out with cheap, smaller names before and they've never worked out (see Naismith). For where we're trying to be or to even hold onto 6th place we need quality not these stop-gap players. 

* I presume you mean Grant Hanley but in my opinion from what I've seen he's not better than what we have in Duffy and would presumably cost a bomb for someone who's not good enough. If he's not good enough for Liverpool, he's not good enough for us.

* To say we're desperate is an over exaggeration. Players all over the country would be desperate to play for us and while we may not be able to afford a lot we can attract quality players (see Mirallas, Pienaar, Drenthe, Fellaini, Baines etc.)

* No one knows how much money we'll have but presumably the extra revenue from TV and players like Heitinga leaving will add to our budget. Now I'm not proclaiming to know who the best players are or who's available but I can offer an opinion, and in my opinion Alacaraz wouldn't add a thing to our squad other than extra expenditure on the wage budget. I'm sure players like Martins Indi or De Vrij at Feyenoord would be better options but obviously they are going to cost money but so did Fellaini and it's an investment on young players for their best years.",0,1371056379,null,0,false,0,cahg7t7,t3_1g6ts9,t1_cahg7t7,t1_cahf0zg,null,1430834920,1,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,1

I think its very very tenuous and weak  to argue a child missing a meal at 12 or 1pm when he is discharged at 3pm (or around that time) constitutes a failure of duty of care and places a child in danger or risk.

Private companies are not slush funds to plug the gap for irresponsible and lazy parents.

If you haven't given your child adequate money for his lunch the blame rests entirely at your door for when it goes hungry.

It sickens me that we treat children so pathetically that missing one meal is treated at extreme suffering and anguish.

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"&gt; you can't pre-judge the outcomes of the new manager when he just started two weeks ago.

I am not. I am not saying 'he is going to be shit for us'. I am post judging his Wigan side, which was very poorly coached and seemed pretty clueless at times.

&gt; Neville's job was seemingly taken over by Jags for the last 6 months of the year 

On the field captain and club captain are two distinctively different roles. What Neville did was drive the team and the youth off the pitch, and did so in a way very few players will be able to do. 

&gt;In regards to battling for players, we've had to do that for all of Moyes' tenure. Arteta was a battle, Rooney was a battle and Pienaar was a battle.

Losing all of these players (and Lescott) has resulted in us going on woeful runs of form that has seen us right at the bottom of the league. 

&gt; and to say Sunderland, Stoke, Fulham and Newcastle have better first XI's than us is absurd. 

Maybe not better, but comparable. Newcastle at full strength I would say is better than us by some margin on paper.

&gt;We've tried to pad the team out with cheap, smaller names before and they've never worked out (see Naismith). For where we're trying to be or to even hold onto 6th place we need quality not these stop-gap players.

Convenient you pick Naismith here, not the squad players who have done decent enough- Gibbo was a smaller name that nobody wanted for example- even Oviedo has done OK for a FT, offering a rest for players on the left when needed. 

&gt;I presume you mean Grant Hanley but in my opinion from what I've seen he's not better than what we have in Duffy

This is so wrong it is insane. He is 5 times the player Duffy is- is a born leader and the archetypal 'traditional CB' who has shown consistant performances both for club and country at a very young age. 

&gt;To say we're desperate is an over exaggeration. Players all over the country would be desperate to play for us and while we may not be able to afford a lot we can attract quality players (see Mirallas, Pienaar, Drenthe, Fellaini, Baines etc.)

Drenthe was an outcast, Fellaini was way overpriced and we were the only interested club willing to put down the cash, Baines was a small name when we bought him and Pienaar was a squad player in a side we are supposedly challenging against. There is not a 'big name' in that bunch when we signed them. 

&gt;I'm sure players like Martins Indi or De Vrij at Feyenoord would be better options but obviously they are going to cost money but so did Fellaini and it's an investment on young players for their best years.

I don't think you are understanding the concept of a squad player here, Alcaraz is someone to fit in when needed, not a £15-20m player like Idi who has got the big boys like Inter and Arsenal after him. Just like with Fellaini we cannot attract people like him unless we are prepared to blow our entire budget on them, which I don't feel is good business.
