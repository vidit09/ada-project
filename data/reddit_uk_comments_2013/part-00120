true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"The seventh Doctor is my favorite. I told myself when I started watching classic many months ago that I wouldn't pick a favorite. I wanted to love all the Doctors. And I do. But the seventh has stolen my heart.

He's got a dry humor with a dark Time Lord power underneath, and of course, a kickass companion: Ace. Their relationship is so unique, it's a tag-team ""you do the talking, I do the walking"" with 7 as a sort of stand-in parent/guide and tutor. Yet at the same time, it's almost, if you want to put on the goggles, romantic. But because of the tutor/guide thing and 7's distant otherness, it's very platonic.

And by dark Time Lord power I mean that during the seventh Doctor's era you got the feeling that while the seventh seems like a goofy dusty professor on the outside, sometimes you can tell there's an undercurrent of something. This something is alien, it's terrifying, and it's dangerous.

But it's different from the godlike awe I get from the tenth Doctor. This is where it gets hard to explain. The tenth Doctor's godlike-ness, in my opinion, relates to his vanity. Both are very unique to the tenth Doctor (unlike the shallow narcissism of the sixth or fourth).

But the tenth Doctor makes you think that he is some kind of tragic and lonely god high above us who lives in another plane. The seventh Doctor feels more like a pervasive sense of otherness. Dark otherness. (That and it's been pointed out to me that while Tennant is a fantastic actor, he can't do ""eccentric"" to save his life despite being a master at barely-concealed-anger. McCoy has the opposite acting strength/weakness.)

Btw, this dark sense of otherness is very strong in the novel Lungbarrow. Funnily enough, he is revealed to be the Other in the novel and his cousins in the House of Prydon often wonder what the Doctor is. He's Time's Champion for one thing...
What's interesting is that I say these things about the seventh Doctor but I don't know how I reached this feeling. Probably because of the story Remembrance of the Daleks. It was my first seventh Doctor story. I think. I don't know why, but there's something compelling about his personality. It's a blend of dignity and humility, comedy and darkness.

In retrospect he's also an amazing Doctor (and I'm more sure he's my favorite now) because of his excellent run on Big Finish Productions' audio drama range. McCoy's stories have made me cry. Yup. And break my heart. And just recently I listened to what is, imo, the best radio drama* I've heard yet out of 200+ and it's with SEVEN.

*Despite the term ""radio drama"" it's primarily just for purchased on www.bigfinish.com (though it has been on radio). They use the original actors for Doctors and companions, have full cast with full sound. It's not people sitting and narrating. It's like tv but for your ears.

Suarez is giving other reasons, the media, as to why he wants to leave.

(Just realized those are all Eleventh Doctor episodes; that wasn't intentional.)

Basically, I like being told a very different kind of story every few episodes. Sure, a few fall into a formula (usually base-under-siege), but when those are well done they're great fun, too.

And then there's the Doctor - a hero who doesn't fight evil by actually *fighting* (most of the time), but by outsmarting everyone. It's a show that tells its audience that it's okay - hell, it's *cool* - to be smart instead of strong.

They asked me what would happen if Chelsea lost? I said without any hesitation,""cry like a bitch."" ""but what if they win?"" I replied,""run out of that door and scream on the top of my lungs for the neighbors to hear."" 

So when Muller headed the bounce goal, they all just started laughing, thinking it was over. I still had hope. I mean after coming that far, that was not how Chelsea would go out. When that corner was given, I had a feeling something good was going to happen. ""DRRROOOOGGGGBAAAAAAA!!!!!!"" Martian Tyler always has a way of making memories like that so much sweeter. 

Then came the penalty shootout... I was the most nervous I've ever felt in my life. When Mata missed the penalty, my heart meet my stomach in the middle of my chest. I felt the tears coming up. ""NOT LIKE THIS! NOT LIKE MOSCOW..."" I sat there in disbelief. But like a spark in the midnight sky, hope filled me as swiney missed the game closer. ""And it come's down to Drogba; who this time is the 5th penalty taker in the final shootout..."" 

After Drogba scored the goal, I bolted a foot off my couch, and sprinted out the door with my hands held high. After 5 mins of running around, I find my roommates had locked me out. Didn't matter. Chelsea had become the Champions of Europe. Then I got ape shit drunk that night for my birthday. Best Birthday Ever...

1.
Depends on what you want from the match. If you want a great atmosphere, sit in Matthew Harding Lower. They sing, stand and are obnoxious but you get the full experience of an English football atmosphere if you sit there. If you want great center line seats, west end is good. 

2. Not sure about a hotel but if you stay anywhere in London you can reach the stadium by the underground which is easy to use. Pubs around the Bridge are always fun for before and after matches. You can't sit and watch the match with alcohol so lots of pregaming going on. 
3. Not sure about meeting the players but you can go down and take pictures before the match as they are warming up. Depending on your section, you could be about 15 feet away from them.
4. Not sure.  Might depend on your section and how big the flag is.

true,warpus,null,null,"&gt;  I figured I'd see if anyone had any interesting stories about where they were and what they were doing when, for example, Chelsea won the Champions League.

When Chelsea won the Champions league I was in [Huaraz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huaraz), Peru, gateway to the [mountain range](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordillera_Blanca) that contains some of the tallest (and prettiest) mountains in South America.

My 3 week long backpacking trip through Peru was booked before I knew that we were playing in the final.  This changed some things initially.  The plan was to hike the 90km long Salkantay Trek to Machu Picchu, and then to make my way to Huaraz and complete the 50km Santa Cruz Trek trhough the surrounding mountains.  However, the Champions League final meant that I would have to hold off on the second hike for a couple days, as my flight to Peru was on the 5th of may and the 2nd hike was scheduled to begin on the 17th. 

I wasn't going to miss the final, so I posponed the second hike.  I ended up severly injuring my ankle on the Salkantay Trek though, which meant I couldn't hike the Santa Cruz Trek, even if I wanted to..  It ended up being  partially closed anyway due to an avalanche -  You could only hike it halfway.  That made me feel a bit better, although I did feel bad for all those people who weren't able to complete the hike either - as it is [quite spectacular](http://i.imgur.com/Le4nOy9.jpg)..  I have plans to return to Peru at some point in the future so that I can complete it, but I have no idea when I'm going to be able to do this.

After Huaraz I made my way north through the country via bus all the way north to [Mancora](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A1ncora) so I could relax a bit on their amazing beaches.  It's very close to the equator and ended up being a great way to finish off a memorable trip.  You wouldn't believe how huge some of the insects were by the way..  It kind of blew my mind.

But back to the Champions League final.  I watched it in a restaurant with my hiking buddy (from Canada), a Swiss girl we met in Lima, and a German couple who were cheering for Bayern.  They joined us at our table eventually - after Drogba scored in regular time.  When it happened my brain wasn't processing the information correctly.  I didn't realize it was a goal, even though it quite clearly was.  I think I just couldn't believe it..  I was overcome with emotion.  I stood up a couple seconds late, put up my hands in the air, and screamed.  The Germans started laughing and joined us.  Turns out they were St. Pauli supporters, and were cheering for Bayern to support the German team, but they weren't really that upset when Chelsea won.  They were far more neutral observers than I initially thought and engaged us in a lot of interesting conversation: about football, Peru, travel, Germany, politics, and so on.

It was an amazing day and I ended up quite drunk.  The grande cervezas just kept coming, especially during extra time.  I just couldn't believe what the hell was going on and I didn't really think that my visit to Machu Picchu and Peru could have been made any more memorable, but there it was.  My team won the motherfucking Champions League!!!  We finished off the day with a giant dinner and more beers.

So that's where I was when we won the Champions League.  Here's a slideshow of that 90km hike to Machu Picchu which busted my ankle, as well as some shots of Machu Picchu, for those who are curious..  and oh yeah, there's 2 videos in there too, one of me on a horse on day 2 (I had high altitude issues and so for 3 hours ended up on a horse - for the first time ever..  freaked me out) and then the highlight of the trip - the summit of Machu Picchu mountain, which was probably the most amazing place I've ever set foot on.  Once I make my way to Stamford Bridge, it might have to be demoted to #2 though ;)

BBC Newsreader 'T' you mention would be used by traditionally well-spoken people (i.e. Posh people, James Bond, Keira Knightley, Jean Luc Picard, V from V for Vendetta, the Lannisters from Game of Thrones)

The typical 'T' is kinda normal, so less 'posh' than the BBC newsreader T.

The other end of the spectrum for Ts at the end of a syllable is the [Glottal Stop T](http://davidbrett.uniss.it/phonology/glottalStop/glottalStop.html), as traditionally used by Cockneys/regional working class, plus: footballers, Russell Brand, Adele's speaking voice, Michael Caine, anyone from Snatch, Jon Snow from Game of Thrones.

... so most people use two out of the three, depending on who they are, and probably the situation they're in. I teach English as a foreign language in London, and I personally think that the use of the Glottal Stop is the first and only surefire indication that the student has legitimately exposed themselves to the language IRL, and it's always lovely to hear, probably because it makes someone sound at least a tiny bit more 'street'.

It's worth mentioning the 'D'-style T, as used by lots of the English-speaking world (North America, Ireland, Australasia) which tends to go well with any American-y accent where you pronounce the Rs (e.g. Butter = 'Budderrr' vs. the British 'Buttah') - So this generally seems to include Spanish and Portuguese speakers, and Northern Europeans like Scandinavians and the Dutch.

If you have a specific career you feel you need to do in life that looks like there'll still be a need for graduates in 4 years time, you can afford it, it won't be paid off quickly then it's worth doing a degree, but only just about.

In almost no other case is it worth doing a degree. After a few years in the workforce (depending on your career choice) you'll have experience that trumps a degree.

true,Anotherfuckwit,lfc55,,"Do you remember the first time you ever saw Suarez? My guess is that it was the same time that I first saw him. It was in the 90th minute of a quarter final in the World Cup and he deliberately handled the ball against Ghana to prevent a goal. I bet that, like me, the thing that sticks in your mind was not the handball itself, but him jumping for joy in the tunnel area when the resulting penalty was missed. Try to remember your feelings for that player then. Not now but then.


While the rest of the world discovered a new villain in one of the most infamous moments in world cup history, there were not many Uruguayans complaining after that game. Indeed, even the coach came out and said stop blaming him, etc, etc. This kind of rhetoric we expected of course because, hey, they're hardly going to complain about him themselves are they because they're the beneficiaries of his actions.


We *support* our players. We love them and whilst we hope that they will all display the kind of moral fibre we see in the Carraghers and celebrate instances like the sportsmanship once famously displayed by Fowler (let's ignore the 'gay' baiting of Graham Le Saux for argument's sake) we accept that there are other characters of more dubious character and, El-Hadji Diouf aside, we embrace them for one simple reason. These guys, Souness, Ruddock, Suarez, etc. are *our* villains. Occasionally, we get so drawn into the joy of watching the amazing talent of players like Xabi Alonso that we *completely* fail to see what dirty little bastards some of our guys are. Not so the fans of other teams who fall victim to their antics.


Anyway, back to Suarez; our 'why does everybody suddenly hate him,' hero. I don't believe anybody *does* 'suddenly' hate him. Liverpool fans have, for a long time, been secretly embarrassed by Suarez' antics on and off the field and, if we are as honest with ourselves as the 'greatest fans in the world' claim to be, secretly furious with the negative publicity he brings  at the very time when we are fighting *such* an important case in courts and in the eyes of the world for the very reputation of the club and the fans


We forgive him, though. We *support* him because that is our job, it's in the job *title*: 'supporter'. As long as he is *ours*.


And so, in answer to your question. Why are so many people turning...? It's happening subconsciously because right now, despite what is being said, here, there and everywhere, Liverpool fans are not quite sure if he's still *our* ingenious villain.


Edit: for my own part, I want him to stay. I'd prefer it if he didn't dive so much, and do the ridiculous and unnecessary opposition baiting - it's embarrassing.

It's amazing that you would swat away the issue of informed consent regarding non-therapeutic testing like some triviality whilst trotting out the tired anti-intellectual cliche smear of conspiratorial nonsense. In a slimy way you are obscuring the fact that it happened by fetishising what is at most a journalistic misunderstand. The events happened and we will likely never know the full extent but we do know they used live bacteria, again on mass around the south coast. Do you think the Queen^TM would have agreed to the testing or would her and other dysgenic elites have been quietly notified to avoid infected areas? Who knows?

true,borbus,null,null,"As others have said, some people replace the Ts with glottal stops.  This is considered degenerate and, at least when I was in school, we were encouraged not to do it.

In RP you should pronounce all Ts and not use glottal stops.  Generally the more glottal stops you use, the less educated you sound.  If you put a full glottal stop into ""butter"" and ""forty"", that would sound pretty uneducated.  I think generally, if you drop *all* Ts in an utterance it will sound bad, but you can drop some and still sound acceptable.  For example, pronouncing nineteen forty-two in RP you *should* pronounce three full Ts.  But when speaking faster, the first one to go will be the second one, then the first one.  The third one can't be dropped.

Here's a good example which you can study between Richard Dawkins and Ricky Gervais: http://youtu.be/DNS-vcFP0lc  Dawkins is a very well educated professor who speaks good standard RP.  Gervais is a more ""common"" Thames valley speaker but would still be considered educated, intelligent and well spoken.

Of particular note: he drops the T from the end of ""irrelevant"" and ""ignorant"", actually pronouncing it closer to how the French pronounce -ant.  This is very common amongst all southern speakers.  Same with ""it"".

He drops the T in liberties.  This is much less common and is a particular quirk of his accent.  Same with spirituality (note only the second is dropped, you can't drop the first).

This is all pretty interesting and you can make a life's work out of studying it (it's called phonetics).  But if you want to speak RP, speak like Dawkins and don't drop the Ts.",0,1371287809,null,0,1371288728,0,cajc6x3,t3_1gdz3w,t1_cajc6x3,t3_1gdz3w,null,1435558465,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

If you live in Cornwall, chances are you have a radon trap in your home - the radiation source is radium in the earth itself. If you live in a stone house, use air travel or had an X-ray at some point in your life, you've probably received more radiation than if you lived near a nuclear power plant for 20 years. Even if you eat certain foods (including bananas) then you're getting a miniscule dose of radiation each time.

So while we shouldn't be spreading low-level radioactive waste around any more than is absolutely necessary, this is a problem which becomes a lot less significant when compared to background exposure from both nature and the technology we use on a routine basis.

true,wateringbrum,null,null,"Great discussion post. I think one of the main Torres related debates is his goal-scoring record.  This season he's scored approximately a goal every three games. His biggest goals for us seem to be the winner against Newcastle, the winner against Arsenal and his vital goals in the Europa League, namely against Benfica.

Its difficult to judge Torres all that much though because no competition has outperformed him. Filling Didier Drogba's boots would always be difficult, but if anyone could've done it it should have been a £50 million signing. Nevertheless, Ba has been inconsistent and although he scores some beauties he has been disappointing. 

This leads one to believe the issue is our formation. Our midfielders (and CBs actually...) have more then picked up for a lack of goals from our strikers. Lamps, Hazard, Mata and Oscar have had a great haul. Maybe the problem is our formation and tactics don't favour a striker?

Next season will be very interesting. I want to see Torres stick around and fight for a place vs. Lukaku. I'm not sure how I feel about Ba.

Ultimately, Mourinho would not have returned to the club to the club to manage a striker who doesn't score. He won't play Torres if he doesn't perform, despite the £50 million price. If he was happy to bench Casillas, a club legend, he won't tolerate an out of form player. 

I'd like to think we're in good hands.

*£53 billion - Additional cost of funding pay and pensions for public sector workers over and above the private sector average, based on analysis of figures from the Office for National Statistics and the Pension Policy Institute*

Pay isn't much more in the public sector than private sector. You need to adjust it for level of education required, at which point the public sector is fairly similar. Pensions are far higher in the public sector though, so that's a valid gripe.

*£25 billion - Amount wasted through inefficient public sector procurement and poor use of outsourcing, based on an authoritative report from the Institute of Directors*

A bit vague, though I have little doubt that there is still waste from poor procurement.

*£20.3 billion - Cost to the economy of public sector fraud, according to the National Fraud Authority*

Identifying this as a cost is fairly similar to identifying welfare fraud, or tax evasion. Obviously we're all against it, but it's hard to estimate or suggest policies to combat it other than simply ""stop it"".

*£5 billion - Amount paid in benefits to those with an income in excess of £100,000*

Some of that will probably be DLA, but I agree that the benefits system needs to be targeted at the poor.

*£4 billion - Losses to the taxpayer from RBS and the sale of Northern Rock*

They haven't been sold yet.

*£2.9 billion - Amount spent needlessly by the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills and Department for Culture, Media &amp; Sport, which should both be scrapped*

Well their combined budgets are much more than £2.9 billion, so I presume it means siphoning off some areas into QUANGO's or other departments and then abolishing other areas.

true,TimYoung,null,null,"Torres is a one trick pony whose only world class skill was playing on the shoulders of defenders and then being put through on goal to go 1 vs 1 with the gk.

Unfortunately, he lost his pace and lost his only one ability that made him world class.  I remember the game against at Newcastle last year when we had the lead; Newcastle pushed forward to attack leaving a ton of space behind and we sat back with only Torres upfront.  He was put through on goal and their defender stepped up so Torres had about 10 yards lead and the defender turn around caught up with him.  What a sorry sight to see.  Whereas Sturridge was beating defenders for fun with his pace and made their left back look stupid, Torres made their centre backs look like Linford Christie.

The biggest problem about Torres is that unlike Owen, he have absolutely no other footballing skill that is above average apart from his one trick.  He is not a natural finisher like Owen or Falcao, not particularly strong or good in the air like Drogba, can't dribble, poor first touch, his positioning is terrible, poor passing and afraid to shoot.  In the same way when he played for Spain he looks like a fish outta water (everybody playing tiki taka and when it gets to Torres, he loses the ball.  Also, which idiot say he is a 'technical player'?  What technical ability does Torres have???), I would say since we got all these technical players like Mata, Oscar and Hazard, Torres look even more a lump of lard since he is the one that loses the ball most of the time.

The amount of Torres fanbois that filled this site can't give any good reason why he is consider a good footballer, nevermind a top striker our club needs.  He is lost it and will never get it back.  I wish we can get rid asap.  Not good enough for the first team and he doesn't made an impact as a sub either.  Totally no use to us and praying we'll get rid of him this summer.

I didn't dodge it; you didn't raise it! I'm trying my best to consider your points but when I disagree you keep changing what those points are.

I'm afraid I don't have time to watch that documentary. That first article specifically states the two bacteria, which is promising, but as with the Guardian article seems to have no commentary from qualified scientists. I know enough to realise that I do not know enough to make a judgement on this. Where is the comment from someone who does? The absence is highly suspect. There is a quote from a scientist there about immunocompromised patients, which is worrying, but it seems to be a general comment about the bacteria rather than this specific situation. So again, the article basically says nothing conclusive. 

I'm not ruling out that a potentially dangerous experiment took place, especially since standards were probably lower back then. But if there were a real scandal I would expect a scientist to have published an informed opinion in some respected medium. As it is you're providing increasingly obscure references (who even wrote that first article?) that just increase my skepticism.

&gt; private company does have micro and macro-level access

Access? Yes. Understanding? No. If you're the head of McDonalds (ignoring that it's actually a franchise model) then yes I'm sure you have a good idea, since you have an army of very similar workers in very similar environments. But if you're the head of, say, Microsoft or Google then obviously the CEO isn't going to know every line of code or even every mid-level design decision. Even looking at design documents wouldn't help because you wouldn't have the context to understand them. This isn't bullshit, it's experience, not to mention common sense. Most organisations have complexity that is simply beyond human capability to understand all at once. You have to rely on lower levels giving a good summary of relevant information.

One notable thing that differs between CEOs and ministers is that often (not always!) CEOs are actually technical experts in their fields (e.g. Schmidt at Google and Bullmer at Microsoft). I would say that *this* is a big problem with ministers running departments (in theory mitigated by expert advice from the civil service), but this obviously a completely different problem from the one you're suggesting.

&gt; You also don't get to refute the event if you find some ""mistake"" in the Guardian article.

I think those people who don't rate Oscar has never seen him play live.

I would say we should see the best of him coming season with enough rest and hopefully Mourinho will see what I see in him.

true,_lolwhat_,IM,isle of man,"Torres is no longer the Torres of old. He will never get that back. But, he got a lot stronger, physically, towards the end of the season. He had some pace, ran harder and was actually able to hold up the ball. Perhaps he changed his training. Whatever it was, he needs to continue that. Huge improvement from the start of the season.

At this point of his career, I don't think he can be a lone striker. He seems to play more of a CF role, rather than a striker. He holds the ball and sets up passes for Mata and Hazard. He just does not seem to want to take chances with hit shot any longer. Perhaps he needs to be paired up with another striker. He could work well with Lukaku, who is physically imposing and is not afraid to blast shots.

People always bring up the 8 goals scored. But, he made some huge goals for Chelsea. Him saving Chelsea from utterly being humiliated by Brentford is worth 5 goals to me.

true,JalapenoRex,null,null,"First, to the point of longer episodes: as the BBC is a publicly funded company, each show is essentially handed a budget at the beginning of the year and the number of episodes they're ""allowed"" to make is directly related to their popularity and said budget. The fact that DW gets 13 episodes a year, including specials, is astounding (likely related to the fact that it's essential to the British cultural identity). Think of all of the other BBC series' that don't get many episodes or are one time only (Sherlock, Jekyll, Spies of Warsaw, etc.). So, you must ask yourself: would you prefer 3-6 longer episodes that are more developed or 13 that are less so....? Personally, if it were more like Sherlock and I had to deal with fewer episodes, I would take that bargain in a heartbeat.

Now, to the point of the topic: the sonic screwdriver has become a very lazy plot device indeed. In past DW, the sonic screwdriver was phased out because the producers didn't want it to become the ultimate problem solver for the series. This is what happens far too frequently now: The Doctor comes up against a problem that took 35 minutes to develop, then uses the sonic screwdriver to fix it in the next 5 minutes or less. Forgive me for not remembering his name, but there was a writer/producer for the show being interviewed back in the day (who had completely phased out the sonic screwdriver) when he was asked, ""What if The Doctor is stuck in a prison cell and can't get out?"" (or something along those lines), to which he replied, ""If he can't get out, then he shouldn't be in there."" Thus implying that if a writer put The Doctor in a prison cell, he/she should be able to use the plot to develop a way out.

true,TorresOut,null,null,"I don't get the Torres defenders. ""He showed some improvement towards the end of the season"". Well, okay, but that is not a good argument against getting in a new striker who will be better than him from the *start* of next season. And call me cynical, but his better attitude seems to coincide with the running out of excuses, and an incoming new manager. He is no longer under Drogba's shadow. He has had enough playing time. He is valued and indeed loved by the club. Sulky Torres becoming Happy Torres is not enough of a reason to keep him as first choice striker. 

""He scored a few goals this season"". Not many in the Premier League or the Champions League, which is where we need our strikers to perform, and where his number of goals scored were abysmal. His goals scored is not a good argument against bringing in someone better.

""We don't play a style that relies on solely a striker, we score from everywhere."" The problem is, when we do create a chance for our striker, Torres usually mangles it. Again, this is not a good argument for bringing in someone who has a history of not mangling chances.

""He's so pretty though"". We still have lots of pretty players. Who score goals. 

""He scores spectacular goals"". Torres, our top striker left it till late May to score his first Premier League goal of 2013. Simply not good enough. Look at his goal against Benfica. It's a great goal. But how many times has he done this throughout the season? I would say both Ba and Luiz have scored more spectacular goals than Torres this year. When we were discussing Schurrle, his YouTube Bundesliga highlights were a lot more impressive than Torres' 2013/14 goal highlights. The very phrase ""Torres 2013/14 goal highlights"" is laughable. Which, ironically, is pretty sad.

""He helps out in other ways"". We have enough talented players for creating chances and assists. His job is to score goals. For whatever reason, be it longstanding injury or our playing setup, or just plain lack of skill, he is not good at this. 

Torres seems happy to see out the rest of his contract here. So we can't just sell him unless he agrees, which is unlikely given the huge drop in pay that would entail. But leaving him as our top striker not only doesn't help us, often it hurts us.

Honours and awards

Cox has received many awards for his efforts to publicise science. In 2002 he was elected an International Fellow of The Explorers Club and in 2006 Cox received the British Association's Lord Kelvin Award for this work. Also in 2006 he was awarded a Royal Society University Research Fellowship (an early-career research fellowship scheme). A frequent lecturer, he was keynote speaker at the Australian Science Festival in 2006, and in 2010 won the Institute of Physics Kelvin Prize for his work in communicating the appeal and excitement of physics to the general public.

In July 2012, Cox was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Huddersfield.[45] Later that year, he was awarded the Institute of Physics President's medal by Sir Patrick Stewart, following which he gave a speech on the value of education in science and the need to invest more in future generations of scientists.[46] On 5 October 2012 Professor Cox was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the Open University for his 'Exceptional contribution to Education and Culture' [47] In 2012 he was also awarded the Michael Faraday Prize of the Royal Society ""for his excellent work in science communication""",0,1371301309,null,0,false,0,cajdrpf,t3_1ge1w3,t1_cajdrpf,t1_cajd5ah,null,1430801562,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I was using it in the sense ""crazy conspiracy theory"", which is pretty standard idiomatic usage. And certainly that first article you posted was. Not a shred of scientific evidence there.

&gt; That actually makes you a liar or grossly misinformed.

I can't defend myself, because I'm not sure exactly what you're accusing me of lying/being misinformed about.

&gt; We and he was talking about access. 

As previously, apologies if I've misunderstood you. As I read it, you seemed to be talking about understanding. The part you quoted in the second comment said that ministers and MPs did visit the facility, which I read as saying they had access to information, but couldn't possibly look through all of it. 

------------

All of this is skirting round the core issue: lack of verification from experts. Whenever there's been a scandal in the past an expert has been able to verify. E.g. the scientist who warned of the BSE crisis (and who the government tried to discredit by making him have a sanity test). The scientists (many) who fought back against the MMR vaccine / autism hoax. David Kelly on the Iraq dossier. I'm sure there are exceptions where there were no experts with the knowledge or the bravery to blow the whistle, but it sounds like there is very detailed information publically available, so I don't think this could be a situation like that.

I don't have the expertise to understand this properly, and it sounds like you don't either.

true,dianode,eng-Cheshire,"Cheshire (Lancashire, honest)","&gt; The problem is there simply should not be 'logistic cock-ups' when it comes to nuclear waste of ANY KIND.

You are correct, there should never be any mistakes when it comes to nuclear waste. The same goes for other hazardous waste: whether it comes from fossil fuel, chemical or biological sources.

Due to the nature of nuclear waste (longer legacy in terms of isotope half-life and the fact it's a social hot potato) there are very stringent controls and legislation which exceed those for other types of hazardous waste. These days, such controls are obeyed very carefully in most (if not all) nations which handle nuclear material.

Mistakes do still happen, of course, and they should be punished to avoid them happening more often. In this particular case they were. Whether the penalty is appropriate is subjective.

&gt; We are always told nuclear is 100% safe and accidents cannot happen 'by design'.

I don't mean any offence by this, but this statement is utterly ridiculous. No-one ever states nuclear power is 100% safe. It's immediately disprovable. Plus, we aren't ""always told"" this. Government standpoints on nuclear energy constantly shift and there are a lot of *very* vocal people on the anti-nuclear side.

You're also conflating nuclear meltdowns and nuclear waste disposal accidents. Meltdowns are the ones often quoted as ""impossible by design"" in the *latest* reactor designs - not reactors like those at Chernobyl, Fukushima, Three Mile Island, Sellafield etc. Waste disposal accidents are always possible, unfortunately.

However, there are numerous studies which have come to the conclusion that nuclear power is far safer than, say, coal power when compared over the whole lifetime of a project. This includes the risk of a nuclear accident or pollution in the same way it includes the effects of air pollution caused by coal-fired power. Obviously if you were to compare greener technologies (such as tidal, wind or solar power), nuclear looks a lot less positive. It's all relative.

&gt; This stuff clearly went to the wrong place, clearly, due to the fine. And we are supposed to just say 'yeah whatever'?

No, we're not. No-one is arguing with you on this point. I was merely stating that in the grand scheme of things, some lab coats contaminated with low-level radiation in a landfill somewhere (which were subsequently recovered and dealt with appropriately) are not environment hazards of the highest order when you compare them to background radiation levels we encounter in our day-to-day lives.",0,1371304771,null,0,false,0,cajeda8,t3_1gdzgg,t1_cajeda8,t1_cajdsk5,null,1430801271,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

[Mignolet](http://i.imgur.com/3wV1kPu.png) vs. [Reina](http://i.imgur.com/yIph2NH.png)

**Notable Stats in Mignolet's Favour:**

* 11 Clean Sheets vs. Reina's 14. **I know this is a smaller number**, but considering the state of Sunderland's defence (Bramble, Cuellar, Rose, Kilgallon etc), this is quite impressive. Without Mignolet's performances, Sunderland would easily have been relegated. Mignolet had, I believe, the 5th highest number of clean sheets in the PL, the best out of all the keepers not at a 'big club'

* 2.48 Saves/Goal vs. Reina's 1.27

* 96% Average Claim Success vs. Reina's 89%

**Notable Stats in Reina's Favour**

* 1.10 goals/game conceded vs. Mignolet's 1.42.  Again, we have to think of the defence in front of each keeper though.

* 75% Distribution Success vs. Mignolet's 46%. Possibly the most important stat, given our style of play.

I can give you a real life example of how poor public sector pay is.  I'm a qualified security advisor, ISO 27001 Lead Auditor, various other qualifications under my belt including several from the Home Office Scientific Development Branch (oh how I laughed when they said, ""After you've completed this exam, you'll be able to add several thousand pounds to your expected salary).  All of these qualifications, along with the skills I've developed over the last ten years, entitle me to a salary which is exactly half of what I could pick up in the private sector.  Trust me, I've checked it out.

My reward for staying loyal to the public sector has been pay restraint for the last twenty years, a pay freeze for the last two, the downgrading of my pension benefits most recently in 2007 and again in 2012, no annual bonuses, no Christmas bonus, in fact no fringe benefits whatsoever.

That's why it grinds my gears to read this sort of shit where they're claiming that public sector workers are laughing all the way to the bank via a one-way trip on the gravy train.

**[Josh T. Pearson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpFqx29ychA) @ The Universal, Glasgow, April 2007** - Josh Pearson was the singer/guitarist in the short-lived Texan band Lift To Experience, who only put out one album (my all-time favourite album), *The Texas-Jerusalem Crossroads*. It's a concept album about the end of days, and how Texas is the promised land because 'USA' is in the centre of JerUSAlem. It's bonkers, and incomparably brilliant. Anyway, after they split up, Josh went off the radar for a few years, then started touring solo. He has an incredible voice - close to Jeff Buckley, but more hoarse, and with a distinctive Southern twang. By the time he got to Glasgow, his voice was shot, so he had the whole crowd (about 30 people) sitting around the stage while he played all the songs very softly, and barely sang above a whisper. It was mind-blowing.

**AC/DC @ SECC, Glasgow, June 1996** - It was the *Ballbreaker* tour, and kicked off with Angus Young crashing through the stage backdrop of a brick wall while riding atop a wrecking ball and playing the lead riff from *Thunderstruck*. 'Nuff said. Saw them at Hampden Park again a few years ago - they're still one of the best live bands on the planet.

**Everyone @ All Tomorrow's Parties, Minehead, May 2008** - this was the Explosions In The Sky ATP, so over the course of the weekend I saw: EITS (obviously), The National, Broken Social Scene, Battles, Dinosaur Jr (twice), Animal Collective, ...And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead, Mono, World's End Girlfriend, Four Tet, Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, Silver Jews, De La Soul, Saul Williams, Stars of the Lid, Envy and Iron &amp; Wine.

&gt; In October 2007 Amaral was removed from Madeleine's case and from his post by Alípio Ribeiro, Portugal's national police director, after the former criticized British police in an interview. Amaral told a Portuguese newspaper that the British police were only following leads helpful to the McCanns.[50] He went on to publish a book about the case in July 2008 (see below).[51] He was found guilty of perjury in May 2009 for having falsified documents in the Joana Cipriano case, and received an 18-month suspended sentence.
&gt;...

&gt; The first police officers to arrive acted as if Madeleine had wandered off, which resulted in a failure to secure the crime scene. Madeleine's favourite toy, Cuddle Cat, was with her in bed on the night she disappeared, and was found still on the bed after she disappeared, but police failed to secure it or check for DNA the abductor might have left on it.[95] Neither border nor marine police were given descriptions of Madeleine for many hours after she vanished, and officers did not appear to have made extensive door-to-door inquiries.[96] The police failed to ask for surveillance pictures of vehicles leaving Praia da Luz at the time of the disappearance, or of the road between Lagos and Vila Real de Santo António on the Spanish border.[97] Another mistake was misreporting the height of the man Jane Tanner and the Irish family saw carrying a child on the night of the disappearance. This was given in a Portuguese press release as 5 ft 7 in (1.70 m), but mistakenly appeared in the English version as 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m).[38]

&gt;**P**. Volvamos a lo de su posible salida. Si tiene que salir del Liverpool, ¿le gustaría que fuese con la cláusula [40 millones de libras o 47 de euros] o negociando?

&gt;**R**. Tengo contrato con el club, lo primero. Pero si algún día me quieren fichar, el Liverpool va a escuchar la oferta, como hace con otros jugadores y hacen todos los clubes. Luego deben llegar a un acuerdo los equipos, aunque, por supuesto, la palabra del jugador, en este caso la mía, es importante. Si uno necesita un cambio, debe escuchar al jugador.


&gt;**Journalist** - Let's go back to your possible exit, if you have to leave Liverpool, would you like it to be with an exit clause (40 mil pounds or 47 mil Euros) or a negotiation?

&gt;**Luis Suarez** - First thing is: I've got a contract with the club. But if some day someone wants to sign me Liverpool will listen to the offer, as all clubs do and as Liverpool does with all players. After that the Clubs need to reach an agreement, although of course the opinion of the player (in this case mine) is important. If a club needs a change it needs to listen to the player.

So again: he never says he wants out, or asks Liverpool to listen to him, or to sell him, all he is saying is that he has a contract and maybe if a club offers money for him and Liverpool agree to that someday he'll move on. Which is what every player would say, he is not hinting at an exit or begging Liverpool to sell him.

Disappointed in you lot. He has carried the team in his back for a season and a half. Let's not turn on him at the drop of a hat and instead wait for the whole transfer window madness to brush over us, this manipulating articles only seek to encourage division and internal struggles in the club, we need to keep together and show Luis support, he will stay, he will be brilliant, and Liverpool will slowly rise again. :) ",0,1371311503,null,0,false,0,cajfwfi,t3_1gegcu,t1_cajfwfi,t3_1gegcu,null,1430800545,87,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,87

From the transcript, he is being quoted *slightly* out of context, but I still maintain that he needs to shut the fuck up. To me there is still a clear indication that he wants to leave, and he's clearly implying that Liverpool should listen to his wishes, which he has already clearly stated are to leave. 

He's spoken to the media like half a dozen times in the last month on the transfer rumors. Can he not just refuse to answer the question? Or just give a canned response: ""I am a Liverpool player and all questions about my contract should be directed to my agent""?

It's no surprise to us, because we already knew Suarez was an idiot with the media. But I don't think it's too much to ask that he quits destroying his transfer value with his big mouth. If he's absolutely certain that he 100% wants to leave, he needs to make that clear to LFC internally and deal with the consequences.

He chose to sign a very long contract not a long time ago. Not a long time ago he stated how happy he is in Liverpool. Then he bit a player, and shit changed.

That sucks for him and I understand that. He is right that he is singled out unfairly at times. But at the same time he fucking bit a guy on the pitch, for the second time in his career. He needs to look in the mirror and accept that the biggest creator of his own problems is himself. 

Maybe he knows that, but if so he's choosing to run from his mistakes instead of atoning for them. It's a selfish and poor decision, and one that will impact how I think of him.

It won't undo all of the fucking amazing things he's done for us and I'll always thank him for that. I don't hate him, but he's officially running out of chances here.

Seems to reach the ball ahead of the striker a fair few times as well. Not afraid to dive in front of the striker to get to the ball, almost never misjudges and takes the player out instead; he always seems to time it precisely.

Sunderland would have definitely been relegated without him this season. I've hoped for a couple of years now that we make a move for him when Reina leaves. 5th highest number of clean sheets in the PL, despite Cuellar's frequent attempts to put it past his own net. Without a doubt the best keeper outside of the top 6 imo (and possibly better than some of them as well).

In terms of distribution, it's not as good as Reina's. From my other comment further down, he has a 46% success rate distributing the ball, compared to 75% for Pepe.  However, Pepe's distribution is, on average, 15m shorter (as a result of BR's preferred style of play). I reckon Mignolet is well capable of adapting to our style. He's young after all, and Reina adapted well at the age of 30.

**No**, google it. They were printed incase of a wartime disaster like a devastating (think Dresden) bombing of a British city, or mustard gas attacks (which the public and press widely speculated would be used at the start of the war, as they were in the not so distant Great war). I darsay an invading Germany army simply would have torn down any propoganda like that and installed their own - not withstanding what they probably would have done to anybody found in posession of such material. When these were designed in 1939 the prospect of a German land invasion still seemed distant. Indeed it wasn't until August 1940 when the Luftwaffe began the Battle of Britain (in an attempt to gain air superiority in preparation for Operation Sea Lion, the axis invasion of the UK) that invasion became a more serious possibility. But compared to the preparation that went into D-Day, its fair to say German preparations for the invasion of England never exceeded the embryonic stages and by the end of 1940 were on hold, with the Germans split on two fronts having failed to win the BoB.

You've been with this girl for 2&amp;1/2 years and now things are going south. She's been really good to you and actually brought the best out of you. With her by your side you're beginning to look like the guy you used to be. She definitely had her crazy moments when you had second thoughts, but you stuck with her, then she apologised, got on with it and made up for it by doing some wonderful things or you. 
Then pretty suddenly she tells you she's going to leave you when someone richer comes along. You don't really know who it is but it's probably one of two guys and they're both more successful than you and can offer her more in the future. You've lost some respect for her but you're still with her at the moment.

(I'm sure not many can disagree with this metaphor so far)

Now you've hot two options

1. The immature approach. Start to resent her and lose all respect for her. Then go on the Internet and tell strangers who are in the same position as you how much you hate her, want her to be gone and don't care what she does when she leaves.

2. The mature approch. Be hurt and shocked initially. Then gather yourself, wait for her to leave then start a new relationship with someone else. A healthy relationship with someone who might not seem as wonderful straight away but won't make you question whether or not you should be together. All you really can do is let her move on and just remember she made you a better person who became way more attractive to any new potential suitors.

I do watch them fairly frequently (almost all the time), but I'm by no means an expert on their players' strengths and weaknesses. I just pick things up here and there.

From what I can remember at the moment, he's not the best at dealing with crosses. That's probably his biggest weakness, but one I think he can improve.  As people have said, he's only 24 or 25, he's a baby in goalkeeping terms; plenty of time to improve. Also, Sunderland's back 4 are such a state that there's probably no communication back there at all. Hopefully with better players around him, with better training, he'll come good in this area of his game.

IMO, his biggest strength is his speed. Speed in terms of ability to get off the line **and** ability to react. He can dive to save low shots from point blank and then get straight back up to stop rebounds. For a big bloke he is bloody quick. His hands seem to react before anyone else even realises where the shot is going.

Hope this all helps just a little.  Again, I must remind you and everyone else reading this that I devote my attention to Liverpool first and foremost, by a mile. I'm much more comfortable talking about our players than anyone else's, even Sunderland's, so feel free to take any of this with a pinch of salt.

true,FUCKING_EVERYTHING,null,null,"It's not necessarily the working classes that drop the T, most people do (and classes are very fuzzed these days so they hardly matter), in the video you sent the T in 'part of' can be pronounced many many many ways depending on the accent you're going for. I'd argue that the speaker actually recessed into her native accent for that phrase slightly.  
  
I'll try and explain how the sound she makes comes about (as I'm assuming you're attempting to talk in an RP-esque accent as opposed to a more casual accent).   
  
  



In perfect RP that would usually be a hard T ""par**t** of"", however if you actually sound that out it's extremely laboured and doesn't flow, specifically you have to stop speaking and change the shape of your mouth to pronounce both 'part' and 'of' correctly.  
  
In more casual and common accents most people would almost drop the T completely so it'd become more ""par' of"", with the R's phoneme being cut off early stitched onto the beginning of 'of'. ^(Am I making sense? It's difficult to explain)   
  
This leaves two options when it comes to pronouncing the T in RP, ignoring breaking the flow of the sentence.  
First option: Pronounce the hard T and pronounce 'of' as 'uv'  
Second option: Soften the T just enough that you can pronounce 'of' correctly.  
  
In the video she went for the second option which is probably the more accepted when it comes to RP.  
  
Most of this is just speculation so take it with a grain of salt, I'm not a linguistics expert, just someone who lives in the UK and has an interest in accents. Also bear in mind the woman in the video also has the flair of a regional accent, though I can't pinpoint where it's from.

You must be joking. There have been ample reason to 'turn on him,' but we don't because he's an LFC player.

Suarez isn't the be all and end all of our club, he is merely a pawn in the game (a very good and expensive pawn). We have no reason to sell, other than he wants to sign for Barca or Madrid.

It;s not corruption in anyway at all. These investments are absolutely vital and unless they were fully encouraged to make them they likely wouldn't until there was a crisis situation by which time it would be too late.

Privatisation and Nationalisation both have positives and negatives. Prvatisation can drastically improve efficiency and lower costs in a market, it brings back the incentive factor.

Oh, I'd have him still write those stories, but I want them filtered through Davies and Collinson the way his stories were in the first four seasons.

Tennant is brilliant, and he brings a frenetic energy to the character. He started off so strong in Christmas Invasion - I wanted more of that, more of that manic insanity tempered with the darkness inherent in ""No second chances - that's the sort of man I am."" We saw that, but not nearly often enough. And circumstances outside of his control led to problems with his character - you can't control actors leaving a show, after all, and you have to write around that...

No, in the modern episodes, Eccleston does it for me. He captures Tom Baker's goofy quite well, and imparts a greater depth of anger. I dunno, if he'd stuck around for another season, the show might have gone into the toilet, but I think I'd be willing to risk it.

I would just make this point. If begging gets you £200-£300 a day, even if you were genuinely homeless to start with, you are not going to stay homeless for very long. That is plenty of money to find a place to live. You could stay in a very nice hotel for that, an HA flat is easily within reach.

And then what do you do? You would be seriously tempted to carry on begging, at least for a while until you get properly turned around.

Point is, he almost certainly isn't the only person doing this, probably many beggars are, at least if they have managed to keep off drugs.

Well that's a pretty big legal sounding statement from a private company with very little/or no legal ground to make it...

its my understanding that because of the trouble that private car parks caused (clamping cars when 1 second over timer, hiding in bushes to issue tickets) that the private car parks have had all of there powers stripped from them. 

This means that for all intents and purposes private car parks are now pretty powerless, they can issue fines but have no real legal backbone to get the funds from you.

I suppose with that in mind, you could be an ass and park in any private car park with full knowledge that theirs nothing they can do.


Its my understanding for them to be able to get any fines from you they have to prove that you where driving the car. Unlike counsel car parks who have real power by fining the car owner (via registration) regardless of who was driving.

Mkhitaryan is a goalscoring midfielder, we lack goals from that area and he would be better suited to the no.10 role (defensively compared to Coutinho who is comfortable wide unlike Mkhitaryan). 

All you can say about Mignolet is that he has had a good season, but so has Brad Guzan and you wouldn't bank on making him our no.1 as we look to establish ourselves in the top 4. Being a keeper for a relegation threatened team always seems to skew a keepers reputation because they have to make so many saves.

&gt; ""Agreement Reached: Luis Alberto to move to Liverpool""

&gt; As the story had developed [and been reported] in ESTADIO [Estadio Deportivo] in recent weeks, the negotiations between Luis Alberto, Sevilla, and Liverpool for the transfer of midfielder to Anfield were evident, the willingness of all parties was optimal and finally this afternoon, an understanding has been reached through and through (100%). 

&gt; Thus, the rest of the negotiations can advance so that the agreement is fully completed. Liverpool will pay eight million euros for the player of San José del Valle with conditions that could add another two million. The fact is that in all Sevilla will sell Luis Alberto for just under ten million euros, a figure quite generous in this day and age for a player that spent last year on loan at Barcelona B, which eventually failed to exercise the right to purchase the player for 3.8 million. Now Sevilla will take more than double [that figure].


&gt;Luis Alberto will sign for four or five seasons in the coming days with Liverpool, who hope to officially wrap up the deal early next week once the player signs his new contract, the last step until the agreement is reached.

I'm simply pointing out that if you study the right thing, work hard and aim for the right fields, it's not difficult to get a well paying job.

true,rhiscott21,null,null,"Hi. I work for the homelessness team at a local authority in England and I wanted to advise you that rent arrears do not automatically equate to being intentionally homeless. In fact, in all cases of rent arrears, we have statutory duty before issuing an intentionally homeless decision  under Section 184 of the Housing Act 1996 to ensure that the property was affordable for the homeless applicant. There is clear reference to this in the Homelessness Code of Guidance 2006. 

In this case, if your Mum's failure to pay the rent was purely on the basis that her student loan was not paid in, providing that the loan failing to be paid in was not a 'deliberate act' in doing or failing to do something (e.g. her making no efforts to apply for it before the deadline), then she would NOT be found intentionally homeless.

However, what an authority will have to look at before intentionality is whether the household has a priority need for assistance. If there are dependent children (under 18) then's it's an automatic PN, but otherwise, we would have to consider whether the household was, in law, 'more vulnerable than the ordinary homeless person so that they will suffer injury or detriment if street homeless'.

Very clear, I know!

Things like mental and physical health, substance misuse, criminal history etc are all things to be considered.

I would suggest that rather than your CAB (who will have basic housing knowledge for sure, but unlikely as much as would be required) you would be much better off going straight to Shelter. They will give you the best advice possible, and will link you up with legal representation should you require it.

Local authorities are under huge pressure at the moment regarding homelessness, and it's a sad fact that people will be fed terrible lies about being found intentionally homeless when there's a strong likelihood they won't be.

They may well be able to get assistance and certainly secure emergency accommodation from the council. 

Can I just advise though that's it's not illegal for families with dependent children to be street homeless. It's illegal for the children to be homeless and there is always the possibility that the parents will be left to fend and their children taken into emergency foster care by social services.

You're kidding, right? Take a look around. This place is crawling with right-wingers, or libertarians who fancy themselves unbiased objectivists. Over on the thread about tuition fees going up, everyone's saying ""good!"" Over on the thread about whether or not kids should be taught about pornography at school everyone's saying ""it should be the parent's responsibility!""

The private corporations pay loads back to the country through corporation tax. They never set up complicated schemes where they end up paying zero percent in corporation tax. The men at the top aren't paid huge amounts of money because the share holders keep them in check. They ensure there is plenty of supply and not let gas stocks dwindle and then jack the price up because there's a shortage. Prices in general are lower due to competition and we have nothing called, oh I don't know, let's make up a new noun for it, I know, ""Fuel Poverty"", because even the most vulnerable are able to afford to heat their homes in the winter.

true,Alyssian,uk,United Kingdom,"Yes, but in maths at Uni, you have to think about problems literally and with upmost clarity.

If you don't have that kind of clarity and you just bash with formulas, you should fail maths. You should get low marks and you should have the grades to show that you are bad at maths.

Also, there was nothing inherently hard about the C3 paper. Look at TSR and the mark schemes and the post-mortem discussion. A lot of the questions were straightforward and simple IF you approached it the correct way. If you don't approach it the right way, you can never usually achieve the right solution.

If you want practise at approaching a problem the right way, do some Olympiads. The physics ones for AS are like mechanics but you need to have clarity about the scenarios. The recent BMO1 paper was also relatively nice, as well as some STEP1 questions. Choose the ones that look manageable, and see what the examiner says.

Now, in theory, the owner or 'keeper' of the vehicle is now liable, but it's still a notice of a charge under a contract you're supposed to have agreed to by parking there, not an actual fine, as private companies, for now, have no power to fine you.

If they want to try to go to court to get that charge out of you, they can, but this rarely happens. I say 'rarely' but it tends to happen when a single vehicle racks up a significant number of these charges. However, what reportedly tends to happen in these cases is that if the company doesn't attend the court, hoping that it'll just go through without them, as often happens in small claims court, which means that if you were to turn up and give pretty much any reason why it wasn't you, or the signs weren't visible or something like that, you'd win as the company wouldn't be presenting any evidence.

Source: I've had a few ~~tickets~~ 'charge notices' and not paid any, but done research just in case.

TL;DR Don't pay anything like this unless it's from a council or the police. Ignore all communications unless it's an actual court summons. If it is, go to court and say there were no signs.

true,formercedric,lincolnshire,Lincolnshire,"It's true. We are all affected by the media we consume. Our beliefs and prejudices are shaped and moulded by everything we see or hear, and not all of it is good. People like to trot out the old wisdom that people know the difference between fantasy and reality enough not to be affected by porn, but that's a fallacy.

Kids can tell the difference between reality and fiction well enough, but they nor adults can stop themselves from adopting the implied values of any fiction. How many on this forum had their first lessons in morality and ethics watching He-Man or Captain Planet? Yet I don't see anyone around here claiming that Skeletor is real.

People know mainstream porn is hyperreal and fake as can be, but the implied values can be assimilated all the same. And even if it doesn't come from porn directly, it comes in the form of peer pressure and changing social norms. How many young men nowadays recoil at the sight of a bush or labial lips? How many men nowadays can't get off without humiliating their partner? How many young men nowadays expect and feel entitled to get anal, or to jizz on their partner's face? How many young women feel cowed and ashamed and resentful if they don't want to do those things? How many grow up thinking their body hair is disgusting? How many want surgery to give them bigger lips, bigger tites, smaller labia, pinker arseholes?

Like as not, for every positive aspect there is to porn, there are just as many negatives. For every man who finds his sex live emboldened and vibrant with fresh porny ideas, there is another who resents his tiny cock and cannot get it to rise unless he can engage in misogynistic humiliation of his partner. For every woman who learns how to give amazing blowjobs from watching a porno or two, there is another who compares herself to those women and feels she cannot remotely compete.

I think it's very important that kids learn all aspects of this. See it from every angle (snarf). Learn to enjoy it responsibly, and avoid the risks if they can. What I think is going on in this thread, however, and others I've seen like it, is that redditors reject the notion of any sort of porn education because they automatically assume it means someone is going to try and take their porn away from them, or at the very least shame them for using it somehow.",0,1371334839,null,0,false,0,cajmesq,t3_1gefoz,t1_cajmesq,t1_cajjlb7,null,1430797406,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

No one can deny his nerves of steel, but he just didn't seem to have the quality of finishing to put that 5th penalty in, and I was really unhappy he was selected as the last penalty taker even before he took the penalty.  Watching the replay of the penalty confirms it for me, if he was nervous he would've put it weakly down the middle or to either side, or blasted it over, but he tried to place it into the corner of the net, which tells me he just didn't have the finishing to put that penalty in the back of the net more than nerves.

I thought the same for Lampard taking the penalty against Liverpool in extra time of the 2nd leg that year: it was such a difficult penalty for him to take after losing his mother, I absolutely thought the correct taker would be Michael Ballack.  He ended up scoring it, and it was an emotional moment for him, but for me, those two decisions were two reasons Avram Grant wasn't cut out to take over as Chelsea manager.

The food is great, so plan on eating there, grab a coffee with a scone and jam with clotted cream, or hang out in the bar (yes, bar in a zoo!). they have (had?) some very rare animals there like the Amur leopard, samalian tiger, maned wolves and a [very special penguin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nils_Olav).   

Not only that, but there used to be a giant garden or nursery where the zoo is now, and they still make a big effort in keeping a diverse assortment of trees and flowers growing around the property, so be sure to admire the flora, too. God... even though I was mopping floors, serving beers, and waiting tables, that was the best job I've ever had.

I don't think AVB is going to leave.  Baldini by a huge number of accounts is someone that Levy liked but AVB loved and wanted to be in as a DoF,

By signing Baldini and not selling Bale we are literally doing everything we can to keep AVB.  There are also large number of ""whispers"" that Baldini is on holiday and that we will be doing a dual announcement of AVB extension and Baldini signing in early July.  But Jason Burt is usuallly pretty on top of our business and by alot of accounts is actually very good friends with AVB so we have to pay attention to the rumor.

I personally think the fact that Leonardo is suspended and by all accounts is the manager that PSG want means AVB wouldn't take the slot.

This is not the case with councel run parking, who can issue fines directly to the owner of the car, regardless of who drove it there. Because of this basic difference the driver will have a very hard time contesting it...so hard in fact I doubt anyone would.

Just knowing that he committed genocide against the Time Lords, and a vague idea of what the Time Lords were trying to do, is enough.   Therefore this must be some NEW horrific thing the Doctor has done, because we know about this already.

It's not.  We have no clue what the circumstances surrounding the event were.   We don't know if it was truly necessary, or a 'kind' way to murder millions, or anything.   All we know is ""the Doctor killed his own people, scary thing were let loose, people were dying horribly and many many times over, and the leaders had gone batshit insane.""

That's not much to go on, and it would make a SHIT TON of sense that there were numerous extenuating circumstances that we don't know about.

&gt;If John Hurt's actions are anything to do with the Time War then why would the Doctor bring ANY attention to the Time War whatsoever?

Because he can't stop thinking about it.   The Doctor has PTSD and an extreme guilt complex.   He likely has frequent intrusive memories of whatever this ""Doctor"" did and saw in the Time War.   So it becomes hard for him NOT to talk about it to enemies, and especially companions; perhaps searching for some sort of relief from the extreme guilt he has, or simply trying to get his emotions out in whatever way he can.   

It's one of the things his mind always works on in the background.  ""WHY did it happen?  WHY did i do that?  WHAT could I have done?  HOW did it all go wrong?""   And as much as he'd liked to spill it ALL out to a companion, he's far too private of a person and too ashamed of it to do that.   He's trying to run from the one thing he can't run away from, and so you see what we've seen on the show: someone who frequently mentions a horrific event, because he can't stop thinking about it, but only in vague details because he doesn't WANT to remember it let alone recount it in full.

**tl;dr** is that the Doctor has PTSD, and what we've learned of the Time War is in all probability a sanitized version of events from a tortured soul that tries so hard to forget, justify and understand but can't stop remembering a time of madness.

The basic premise is, do not pay it.

You can appeal through their channel (appeal will be denied without question).

You can then appeal through an independant company called POPLA (Parking on Private Land Appeals). Do this as it will cost the fining company money for the appeal.

Pepipoo will help you write your appeal to popla, and that will probably be the end of it. There is a good success rate through here.

If the popla appeal is rejected, still don't pay it.

Ignore any letter until you see a court summons (probably won't get that far). They will claim breach of contract.  If it ever gets that far (very unlikely) then pepipoo will again help you with a defense.

The most important thing to note is that they **cannot** force you to pay without a court order - and remember it is **not** a criminal offense.

I recommend looking on the website for more, but dentistry is one of the few things you pay for. However, it is still cheaper on the NHS than to go private.

It's split into three tiers. Tier 1 is stuff like a checkup or basic whitening, and costs £18. Tier 2 is stuff like root canals and fillings, and costs £49 pounds. Tier 3 is stuff like dentures, and costs £200.

As I understand it (I may be wrong) if you have multiple problems (say, you need a root canal, fillings, and you've come in for a checkup) you pay for the most expensive tier (in this case, tier 2) once, even if your treatment is spread over multiple sessions / appointments. So in this example, you might pay that £49 once, for three sessions that cover all of those issues.

&gt;MarkAbernathy @ Charlie Jane Anders (author of io9 article)

&gt;Hey Charlie,

&gt;I figured you or someone at io9 would catch on to this eventually. I was sort of hoping it wouldn't happen. The original rumor states that the films are not in BBC hands yet and negotiations could be tender. So any publicity about this could put them in jeopardy. Regardless, it's hard to stop a moving train.

&gt;In the interest of factual relevance though it should be noted:

&gt;1) Hartnell's Mission to the Unknown, Dalek's Masterplan, and Tenth Planet were never sold/broadcasted in Africa. Feast of Steven was never offered for sale to ANY foreign nation. The recovery of a ""complete Hartnell library"" is difficult to conceive.

&gt;2) Evil of the Daleks, along with Power of the Daleks, Fury From the Deep, and The Invasion were also never sold/broadcasted in any African nation. BBC records about the Sales of episodes are complete.

&gt;3) The original rumor states that the films may be damaged. It is also rumored that other BBC shows may be included in the collection, which would include other forgotten sci-fis.

&gt;4) People need to take these rumors with a GRAIN of SALT.

&gt;Definitely agree about the ""grain of salt"" being indicated. Probably several grains.

&gt;And I hope that too much attention to this topic doesn't screw up the negotiations — especially if these films are damaged and in need of restoration. Getting them into the hands of the professionals at the BBC sooner rather than later would be important in that case.

&gt;Fingers crossed that this is actually true, and that we haven't done any harm by reporting on it — I figured after Bleeding Cool's report, it was sort of our duty to do so. Bleeding Cool is *usually* careful about rumors, although nobody's perfect.

&gt;MarkAbernathy @ Charlie Jane Anders

&gt;That's what many people tell me, but I've been reading about Missing Episodes for over a year now and many of Bleeding Cool's details fly in the face of what had been found out so far. (I detailed them already).

&gt;However, their article is based off a rumor that had been reported by a couple different Doctor Who news websites already (sans the extra details). There are a lot of people thinking that something happened.

&gt;(It is theoretically possible for Tenth Planet and Evil of the Daleks to show up in Africa if they were sent as audition prints or there was a mistake in the records ...)

&gt;""The original rumor states that the films may be damaged. It is also rumored that other BBC shows may be included in the collection, which would include other forgotten sci-fis.""

&gt;While I would (obviously) be thrilled by a recovery of even just one doctor who episode, finding a copy of Z-Cars or Dixon of Dock Green would be pretty awesome too.	 

&gt;Yesterday 11:39pm

&gt; MarkAbernathy @ Desslok

&gt;I was thinking of Out of the Unknown personally. But there's not much information about sales records for other shows. Doctor Who sales records are easy to find online.

&gt;MarkAbernathy @ Charlie Jane Anders

&gt;Charlie,

&gt;I've been reviewing the Missing Episode forums from various websites to get an idea of what the Doctor Who Restoration team have said regarding the rumors. Several times in the past, and most recently this May, they have had to explicitly say that Tenth Planet has NOT been returned nor has any Troughton serial. They have been very firm on these points.

&gt;I personally no longer believe the details of Bleeding Cool's article. Paul Vanezis is a very respected individual with the Restoration Team who has a lot of inside knowledge and makes it a point to never lie. He has stated that he believes some individual has been pooling the various rumors together and approaching websites as a ""trusted insider"" when in fact he is not.

&gt;The rumors are very stubborn. A current variation states that a group of missing episodes were located in Africa, but had not been returned yet. The idea being that they are locked in a ownership war between the BBC and an unknown collector. Several Doctor Who News websites have reported this version of the story. (A couple of whom has stated that Bleeding Cool's details do not match up with what their source is telling them).

&gt;All I know for certain is that the entire situation is a mess. It will either go down in Doctor Who history as the largest return of episodes or the largest hoax.

That's the whole idea behind news sources. They target a specific demographic.

You are free to search for an article that focuses more on the facts if you like but this is a website aimed at socialists and so guess who they are going to target with their writings - socialists. 

&gt;Which is why I dislike the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror for example. Both opposite sides but both driving through their own agenda. And because both are a bit shit as well, naturally.

So you want every single newspaper printed in the UK to not have opinions, nor focus on a particular section of society and print nothing but facts?

Lets face it, there is such a huge crazy frenzy over this at the moment, that if Bale was to die on holiday, Real Madrid would probably want to buy his remains so they could cremate him and feed the ashes to Ronaldo.

I am a bit obsessive so I keep records and the only episodes that exist that are not available on DVD right now are The Mind of Evil with Jon Pertwee and Terror of the Zygons with Tom Baker, both of which are going to be released on DVD this year.

The way that the sets are sold are by ""story"" instead of season. Each ""Story"" has usually 4-6 episodes, although some can be as few as 2 and some can be as many as 8 or 10. Each ""Story"" dvd usually runs about $20-30 brand new, but you can get them used on Amazon for around $10 usually. The only ""Season sets"" from old Doctor who are from seasons that the entire season was a single story, such as season 16 (The Key to Time) and Season 23 (The Trail of a Time Lord). These run a lot more on amazon, like $50 new and $30-40 used. The trade off to paying more is that you get more episodes.

The DVDs also have bonus features like commentaries and documentaries, although these vary with each set.

Someone on Reddit should organize like a dvd trading thing. I have a handful and I bet other people have a handful with different stories.

We know nothing about the circumstances around what he did to end the war, other than he did at great cost to his people and himself.

It's entirely possible that his solution was akin to the US' use of atomic weaponry: it ended the war, but at such a devastating toll that one questions whether there were other ways to end it.  

I believe it's also unknown the extent to which knowledge of and support for ""ending time,"" as it were, was.   It's entirely possible he destroyed the entire civilization because he was otherwise helpless to stop the actions of a few.

In other words: we know very, very, little about the Time War.   It's like summarizing WWII as ""Germany created the Holocaust and formed the Axis; Japan performed a surprise attack against the US; the US and it's allies defeated the Axis by leveling several Japanese cities with The A-Bomb.""   Yeah, you've got the bare-bone outline(ish), but you're missing tons of context, and don't even know what half of those things mean without knowing more of the history.  You're acting like we know everything about the Time War, and therefore whether what the Doctor did was necessary or humane, with a knowledge of it that's patchy at best.

true,[deleted],null,null,"As far as I'm aware, job hunting is pretty much the same. You can either visit the Job Centre, look online or just drop your CV in at somewhere you'd like to work. A CV (curriculum vitae) is pretty much your resume.

The admission policy for UK universities is AWFUL. There's a system called UCAS that we use in the UK. It was set up by government and in order to apply to university, you have to go through UCAS. You input all the personal information it asks you and the universities you want to apply to. You cannot apply directly to the university. You can only apply to a total of five universities and you have to send them all the same personal statement through the UCAS website. You will either get an interview, an offer or a rejection based on your grades and your personal statement. Once you have received all your offers/rejections, you choose a 'firm choice' and an 'insurance choice'. Your firm choice is the university that you want to go to the most and you will get into if your grades are okay. Your insurance choice is the university you will get into if there is any problem with your grades and you don't get into your firm choice. Bare in mind that these choices are a legally binding contract.

For student finance, once the student finance system begins, UCAS will either text you or e-mail you. You then apply to student finance via Student Finance England (if you live in England). You input any information they ask for (they may ask for proof of your income) and they will tell you how much you can get in loans. Once you have chosen which loans/grants to apply for, you input bank details and they will transfer your money. If you're earning under a certain amount per year, you can get a maintenance grant of up to around £3,000 a year that you don't have to pay back (although I don't know if you're entitled to this if you have been living outside fo UK for all your life).

I'm not sure how to apply for student finance in Wales, but if you have lived in Wales for long enough, I know that the Welsh local government will pay for at least £3,000 (a third) of your tuition fees per year.

If you want to live in student accomodation in the university, you're goign to want to check the university website for specific details on how to apply. If not then you might wanna check out getting a travel pass from your local train station or bus station, or you could get a flat close to your university.

If you need any help in the UK with healthcare, you pretty much just book an appointment to go to your GP or go to hospital for any emergency. You may need to register with a GP so that they can make a record for you. If I were you, I'd make a Google search for local practices near where you will live and register with the GP there as soon as you get to the UK. Healthcare is completely free, so that's a relief. 

Travel is easy. You can either go from London to France via the Euro tunnel (a tunnel built under the sea that you can use to get the train to France) and then get a train/coach to Spain, you could get a cheap flight with Easyjet or you could get a coach to Dover and get a ferry to France and then get a train/coach to Spain. You are going to want to apply for an EU health card (if you're a UK citizen) that entitles you to free healthcare anywhere in Europe.

And for any behaviour issues, I think that as long as you stay far away from the /r/MURICA mentality then you should be okay.

You're going to want to subscribe to /britishproblems to moan about your day and learn what British people are interested in, too.

Just thought I'd address your questions about UK higher education. As an American who studied abroad in the UK and is now gong back to the UK full time for another degree I've experienced the full range of frustrations that the system can offer. It is also a very good system for specialization, rather than the more general curriculum you'll find at an American university, but more on that later.

##Admissions
Anyway, the admissions process is fairly straightforward. You enter all of your personal details into [UCAS](http://www.ucas.com) along with info on any of your academic qualifications (US college credits are virtually impossible to transfer, AFAIK), a Reference written by someone who knows your academic work, and a Personal Statement. You can find more information on all of those things on the UCAS website.

You pick up to 5 universities to apply to, and a course (American: major) for each of them (should usually be the same course at all 5 unis as you only upload one PS which should discuss why you're choosing this course) and then once your application is complete you pay a nominal fee - I think around £20 - and your application is sent to each of those universities.

At this point they'll reply with either an unconditional offer, meaning you're totally accepted, a conditional offer, meaning you need to make certain grades, or a rejection. You then choose a firm choice and an insurance choice, although if your firm is unconditional you don't get an insurance (as there's no chance you won't be getting in). If you only have conditional offers, you'll need to meet one of them or else it will be difficult to earn a place.

This system is streamlined to work with English A-level qualifications, which are exams sat by those leaving Sixth Form, which is roughly equivalent to the last two years of high school in the US. I'm not quite sure what credentials you would use; most likely SAT/ACT, high school GPA, and SAT II Subject Tests.

##Assessment
Now, as I said earlier, the British higher education system is well suited to churn out well trained specialists. In other words, if you study History, for example, you will take 90% of your classes from the History department. Unlike American unis, there is no 'core curriculum' that requires you to take science, math(s), or anything like that. Also, in non-STEM courses your grade is usually determined almost entirely by one exam. The grading scale in the UK is also different and is as follows:

|Degree Classification   | Marks    | Read   |
|:-----------|:------------|:------------|
| I        |         70%+    |     ""First""    
| II-1  |    60%-69%   |  ""Two-one"" 
| II-2    |   50%-59% | ""Two-two""    
|III  | 40%-49% | ""Third""
|Pass (no honours) | 40%+ (including re-sits) | ""Dog shit""

##Finance
The last thing I would point out is that you may not actually qualify for loans from the SLC or funding from the Welsh government depending on their residency requirements. Check out the [SLC's FAQ](http://www.studentfinanceengland.co.uk/frequently-asked-questions/applying.aspx) for more details.

The poor guys in the call centre often have no idea why there's a charge to change to a credit meter so they make up something (as with hiddentext ). What they're actually paying for is the cost of a highly trained electrical meter engineer's time, petrol and associated costs. I appreciate it's a sting for the consumer but if the whole process including travel, takes an hour, £50 is comparable to equivalent skilled trades like, say, a car mechanic.

What I found really helpful was ""get a quote"" through [COOP](https://motor.co-operativeinsurance.co.uk/gidirect.motor/start.do).

They have a really quick basic form which asks for you're details (name, address, where the car will be kept overnight, vaule of car and no claims etc...) it took 5 minutes to complete and they give you a quote instantly.

+ They have three tick boxes at the bottom of the form (Do not contact me by phone, post and email) Which I too was also worried about because it's annoying!
+ The only email I recived off COOP was the one for the quote with the reference number for the quote, to go back and edit/change. Not recieved any junk or follow up calls.

Once you've entered your V Reg it'll find your car (Make sure it is your car!) Simple click next and it gives you how much you can pay it off for 12 months and also gives you how much you could pay per month. I found this extremely handy due to the fact I could just save my details and simply enter a different car reg when I next visted. 

Prices could change site to site but I reckon this would give you a rough estimate on how much it could cost in total. I tried what was suggest above, ringing brokers and going into places, even that ""get an estimate"" on autotrader which was rubbish! You dont have to go with COOP but it will give you an idea of what it could be give or take, depending on your no claims, how old you are and if you've had any convictions.

Yup, job applications are pretty much the same the world over. You makes yer CV, and you fires it around the place until someone gives you a call.
Obviously, you want to be setting up shop with some of the online engines as well. Reed and Monster are a good place to start. CWJobs if you're looking at getting into IT as well.  
You will need to provide proof that you're eligible to work, which is passport and proper visa if needed.

NHS is free at the point of delivery, provided you have been, or will be, resident in the UK for a certain period of times (I think it's 6 months). Once you're accepted into Uni, it should just be a case of sending your course documentation if you do get a bill. Other than that, because it's free to residents, expect waiting times. People over here will abuse both A&amp;E (using it for trivial things) and GPs (can anyone say DNAs?), so expect waiting times, and stressed staff.  
If I catch wind of you giving some A&amp;E nurse shit for the waiting times, I'll personally make it my mission to hunt you down, and punch you in the dick. Also, learn to queue.

Spain to Europe shouldn't be too bad, depending on how much stuff you're planning on taking with you on the plane, look at Easyjet or Ryanair if the answer is ""carry on"". Avoid them if you're taking hold luggage, the fees per case are amazingly high.  
It's worth pointing out that if you only hold a US passport, you'll need to sort out student visas, and all that stuff BEFORE you set off from the US.

true,Memoriae,null,null,"It really depends on where you're moving from. Although, as this is Reddit, and 2 seconds in your post history say you're in Idaho at the moment...

So I'll start on the biggies.

Tax:  
Tax in the UK for most people is calculated before you actually receive your pay, it's called Pay As You Earn, or PAYE. Unlike the US system, where everyone has to file their own taxes. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (our version of the IRS, hereafter HMRC) **do** cock up every now and again, and the only contact that the general public have with them is when something goes wrong with their tax code. As I imagine the case is with the IRS, HMRC will chase you to the end of time if you've underpaid tax, but you're looking at 1-2 tax years before you get any money back if you've overpaid (For example, I received a cheque for just over £2k for FY10/11 in overpaid PAYE from a job working in a bank. Go figure that one out. Brilliant with figures and money, fucks up employees tax...). That being said, you can Self-Assess, which will speed the system up a bit.  
While this does mean that you can't take the tax and use it that month (personally, mine would be about £700 a month extra), it does mean that you don't have the situation where you're short over the financial year, and have to leave off beans on toast.

Healthcare:  
Alas, despite what some of the US press would have you believe, the NHS isn't a massive bunch of death panels, run by Thatcherites.
Socialised, free at point of delivery healthcare is one of the biggest benefits to living in the UK. Yes, you do need have been resident for a while in the UK (I think it's currently 6 months), and people do abuse it sometimes (for example, people going to A&amp;E when all they need is a cup of tea and some rest. Or people failing to attend surgery appointments), but if you have something of concern, you don't need to add a medical bill on to the end of it. The NHS is largely paid for by National Insurance (NI) contributions, again, automatically deducted from your pay before receipt. You do have the choice of having private health insurance, and the prices are significantly lower than in the US from what I can see. As an example, I priced up cover for myself and the wife. Neither of us are particular health freaks, and I'm definitely carrying a bit extra around the midsection, but absolute cover for both of us was something like £100 a month, with no excess, and a choice of both private hospitals, and private ""suites"" in NHS facilities.  
That said, we have a problem with locum clinicians at the moment, although these are very much the minority of them.

Unemployment:  
Very much dependent on the area you live in. I'm personally in a pretty well off area of Cambridgeshire, with very little unemployment overall. But the support structure is definitely there for those not in work. Basically, once you're out of work, you register with the Jobcentre, and apply for either income-based, or contribution based Jobseeker's Allowance. The most important thing about registering for JSA, is that your NI contributions are kept up to date, which is important if you're planning on retiring in the UK. JSA isn't a huge amount, but you can apply for other benefits at the same time, most of which are means tested.

Jobs in Education:  
Now this pretty much depends on your qualifications. If you've got the job history, there are a huge number of universities in the UK, 6th forms, and high schools that are always on the look out for tutors. Unfortunately, there's not really that much more I know, as IT and teaching don't tend to mix that much.

true,FelixCros,null,null,"Umm... that's a slight generalisation if you'll forgive me. The Queen speaks Queen's English - a heightened accent which (I'm told) has more in common with classic Cockney than RP.

RP has evolved over the years and we now tend to talk about three versions: heightened RP, classic RP and contemporary RP.

**Heightened RP** is a broad umbrella that includes variations like you hear in Noel Coward (""I'm so heppy to see you.""), fat landed gentry accents spoken through unmoving lips on a lazy exhale, Olivier's Richard III and, slightly oddly, Patrick Stewart making his speech about the Borg (""The line must be drawn hyah!"").

**Classic RP** is all over 70s broadcasting. Think Tom and Barbara Good, Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect etc. People in villages in Surrey, retirees in France and established families in the Scottish highlands still tend toward this accent. It is also, contrary to popular belief, a class-buster - or used to be at least. There are still people who get upset to learn that others don't consider them working class just because they speak RP - even though they come from working class families. Well, maybe upset is strong, but you get me. The popularisation and deepening of regional accents as, among other things, a way to mark difference (we're not toffs therefore the people who speak like that must be toffs) in the 80s and 90s might be a root of this. The BBC's regular inclusion of regional presenter voices on mainstream TV and radio in the early 90s will be another.

**Contemporary RP** you might as well call London RP. Yes, this one is regionalised (unlike the other two). Younger RP speakers these days frequently have London or Kent influences - maybe not in their vowels and consonants but certainly in their rhythms, where they place the voice etc. To hear the difference between **Classic** and **Contemporary**, listen to Alan Coren, then listen to Victoria Coren (Victoria more than her brother Giles, who falls somewhere in between).

Most RP speakers these days fall somewhere in between those two. There are also many who speak RP with local influences. It's common for people who have moved away from their native city (the ""my accent thickens when I speak to my Mum effect""). It is a dwindling accent but not a dead one.

If you respond to this demand for money you may be entering into a contract and admitting liability which could create a mechanism for the issuer to take further proceedings. Open up the ticket and take a look. If it’s simply an invoice you don’t have to pay; you have no legally binding contract with the issuer and so, not only do you not have to pay but they have no recourse in law to make you pay. What I like to do with demands for payment like this is write to them. Write to the head of the legal department or the pre-legal department at the issuing company and say the following; in your own words of course, and remember to never admit liability:

Dear Pre-Legal Department

I write with reference to your recent correspondence dated DATE alleging an un-paid debt of £AMMOUNT, insisting that this amount is paid within 7 days.

I do not believe you are who you say you are. Scams such as phishing, identity theft and fraud are currently very real issues and as such before any further correspondence from your-selves can be considered in good faith you must prove to me that you are who you say you are and that you have a real and genuine reason to be contacting me.

I find the tone of your demand offensive in the extreme. With no previous contact or accompanying evidence on which to base your assertions on you are guilty of offences under the Larceny act 1916.  

Larceny act 1916, section 29 is quoted below:

29. - (1)
Every person who-

(i) - 	utters, knowing the contents thereof, any letter or writing demanding of any person with menaces, and without any reasonable or probable cause, any property or valuable thing;

shall be guilty of felony, and on conviction thereof liable to penal servitude for life, and, if a male under the age of sixteen years, to be once privately whipped in addition to any other punishment to which he may by law be liable.

I have no record of such a debt owing and have had no dealings with COMPANY NAME. This being the case I would like to be informed as to where you assert this debt to originate from; please enlighten me. I want you to prove to me that I owe this money, assumedly, if you are genuine; you have some sort of official paper work, a court certified penalty notice or a County Court Judgment?

At this point I would like to make a formal request for information I am entitled to under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 &amp; the Data Protection Act 1998. Please supply a copy of all information you hold about me. Would you please also inform me of the logic involved in any automated or non-automated decisions you have made about me.

At this point I would like to formally request that you suspend all recovery proceedings. Please note that I will not be held liable for any costs incurred should you choose to ignore this request and proceed with further recovery action while evidence is being gathered and legal advice sought. 

An accompanying invoice has been attached to this letter and payment is requested within 7 days of the date of this letter. 

Yours faithfully 

Don’t forget to invoice them, if they refuse to pay they expose their own hypocrisy and a court will rule in your favour. Good Luck….

Why would the BBC spend so much on animation just to use that as a bluff?  Seems rather silly to me.  But maybe they were partway through the animation process when the episode was recovered, you say.

The BBFC listings would include a mention of the recovered episode.  It would not have gone unnoticed, there.  Someone would have noticed it and started discussing it.

It's all about the two teams' style of play. Ours, Pepe plays the ball short to one of the back 4 and we build an attack from there, keeping possession.

Sunderland, on the other hand, don't play like that. Their defenders are the weakest area of their team. Cuellar thinks he plays for the opposition every week, Bardsley started the season well and got worse, and Bramble is Bramble. Mignolet doesn't play to these back 4, but kicks it long to the midfield/forward areas.  Of course, this means a lower success rate and a lower distribution %.

I firmly believe SM is well capable of adjusting to our style, just like Pepe did this season. At the start of last season, you could tell Pepe was naturally inclined to kick it long, but kept stopping himself in order to find a shorter option. It will be the same with Mignolet I'm sure.

I just wanted readers to be aware that there are positives and negatives to privatisation, too often the news would have us think economics is a science with rights and wrongs, it really isn't.

I don't post or comment here very often so I wasn't aware of that. As a student taking my A levels next year I'm certainly less than pleased about rising tuition fees, and as a 'kid' i can safely say that we don't really need to be taught about pornography at all. No one ever explained it to us at all, everyone just kind've found it and approved or didn't. 

Also you make some interesting statements about how privatisation increases efficiency. It will cut un-profitable services and will indeed lower wages. This is normal and natural, the only reason wages didn't fall and people weren't sacked under nationalisation is that the government will be critiqued since it has a revenue large enough to sustain un-productive or non-profitable businesses at the expense of jobs. Nationalised industries can be a huge drain to a government. Also I don't see why a) they would necessarily take on debt or b) why that would be a bad thing. The days of debt being fundamentally a bad thing are long in the past.

There are many industries were nationalisation is certainly viable, and water may well be one of them due to it being such a vital necessity.

true,Orsenfelt,null,null,"I don't think it's *resentment* it's just that we (Speaking as a Scotsman) are a bit more apathetic to the whole United Kingdom idea than the English tend to be because we have a strong national identity.

England does too but I think for most English people it's tied quite closely to United Kingdom. For them it's interchangeable, to be English is to be British and there is no (or very little) disconnect. This idea is true around the world, what you might see as British stereotypes (Tea, Scones, Roast Dinners, Bulldogs, Men in long furry hats) we see as distinctly English things. 

That's not to say those things don't exist here, there is a huge amount of cultural overlap, but since England is by far the largest part of the Union it's understandable that they are the main driving force behind how it's portrayed. 

This leads to a kind of disconnect for everyone else, a separation of identity. I can't speak for all Scottish people but for me I am absolutely certain that I am Scottish first and British second. I don't identify with the 'quintessential' British things because from where I sit they are predominantly English things. Further to that, despite being a United Kingdom there are plenty of things within the isles that English people don't identify with that I do. Shortbread, Tartan, Loch Ness Monster etc. This widens the identity gap even more.

Again, it's *not* resentment. I don't dislike English people and I don't think they dislike Scottish people. There is simply a disconnect in how we view ourselves within the United Kingdom and that sometimes causes friction. 

It's very difficult to explain I think. The brothers analogy comes up a lot and I think it's a very good one. Scotland and England (as well as NI and Wales) are very similar in a lot of ways and agree on a lot of things but we do still have our own unique personalities and sometimes we think it might just be easier for us all if we just moved out.

Edit - One edit to answer all the points below. Easier - No doubt  - in my opinion and the opinion of staff &amp; other examiners who I work with who have seen the changes over the last 20 years.

As an A level Physics examiner I mark questions that used to appear in the old O level syllabus. As a GCSE examiner I have seen questions that I happily show to my 11 year old and they get it. That would never have happened in 1984. For example in a recent science Higher tier paper A student had to get 6  marks( i think) out of 60 to get a D. (I cannot give you the precise paper as I'm currently locked out of the relevant site!). To get a grade D overall they have to pass other papers too.

In my experience, passing exams these days is about knowing how the system works and knowing how to answer a question the way an examiner expects it. The best schools know this and train their kids to quote the right buzzwords. Eg as X increases Y increases (1 mark), comment on the change of gradient (2nd mark), comment/identify on any anomalies (3rd mark). On a question with an extended piece of wring quote 2 pros, 2 cons use links such as ""on the other hand"" and then express your view supporting it with evidence.( 6 marks) - if you have not had that instruction, then tough.

Gove is putting rigour back into it. It will however turn into another arms race between examiners and teachers who know how to game the system. Biggest improvement is getting rid of pointless coursework and giving teachers more time to teach rather than constantly assessing. I am worried though that in making a more rigorous curriculum we will leave a lot of kids behind and turn them off education.

That's like asking an atheist with a poor knowledge of the bible to point out the contradictions, and if they can't, there is no contradictions! Genius!

When I was in school one if my teachers gave us 10 years worth of past papers to read while we were chatting. The syllabus was largely the same but the level of detailed knowledge required to answer the questions and get the marks was reduced every year. That and grade boundaries. When I did it above 75% was an A grade, in the years before it was as high as 85%.

My sister took her exams 5 years after me and she was required to do even less than I did to answer the questions and get an A grade.

The question is not whether the system needs an overhaul to enable exceptional people to truly stand out rather than giving everyone who can score 75% and over an A grade - it's how we do it.

GCSEs are set out so that there are questions targeted towards every grade-boundary of student. So there will be questions that D grade candidates can answer, and questions that are designed for A* grade students to be able to answer. The difference between now and then is that before all of the questions were at pretty much the same standard, there was no ""easy"" question.

In that respect I think there has been ""dumbing down"" but I don't think the system needs an overhaul and it's actually quite good at separating the talented students from the not-so talented students. What actually needs to happen, in my opinion, is teachers need to be chosen far more rigorously.

true,ripitupandstartagain,lancashire,Republic of Scouse,"That article is written to appeal to people emotionally and misrepresents the science going on. Now I am not in favour of the rapid and unchecked expansion in hydraulic fracturing being lobbied for but I do have a degree in Geophysics which featured petroleum exploration so I know a fair bit about the technology and principles behind it.

Firstly the articles description of hydraulic fracturing is a basic description of any petroleum drilling operation going on today. There simply are not any artesian wells anymore - they have all been tapped and as oil and gas are taken out the pressure drops. This means that in order to have the petroleum rise up the well a denser liquid needs to be pumped into the well to both keep the pressure up (and in most case, increase the pressure so the well starts producing at decent volume) and still allow the petroleum to rise.

Secondly petroleum is stored underground in the pores of rocks, there is not some underground cave or cavity full of oil and or gas (that would obviously collapse as soon as it is formed). Where oil and gas are found they are saturated in porous rock layes below a layer of shale; crack through the shale and the oil and gas can rise, pump a denser liquid into the porous rock and the petroleum is released from the rock. Obviously this water is not going to be able to be retrieved entirely as you would have to dig up the entire layer of rock and hand dry each grain of it. A lot of the water does come back up because once oil production stops, pressure in the well can be released and allowed to find an equilibrium. If done correctly there should not be any seepage in fact if the area they are drilling has any connection to the water table there will be no oil or gas there as it would have all escaped and been replace with denser water. Are there leaks? - yes almost always down to either poor construction or operation of the site or a mistake analysing the site by the geophysicists. Are there always leaks?- No; Can we stop there ever being any leaks in the futur? - No.

So what this means, and what the environmentalists should be saying in this argument is hydraulic fracturing IS petroleum exploration and the UK has strict laws governing the placement of oil wells and where you can and can not drill. The fracking industry are trying to disassociate themselves with standard oil and gas production (even though its the same guys doing it) so that they aren't treated like oil wells as nobody wants one of those next door.

Also the article presents alternative fuel sources as the solution while not comenting on the environmental impact their production causes (which I think would only be fair as this article is about the environmental impact of obtaining gas). For example, like most electronics, solar cells require coltan. The two largest suppliers of coltan are Brazil and The Democratic Republic of Congo (25% &amp; 15% of  the worlds supply respectively). This is fuelling a massive mining industry to develop in countries with poor safety and environmental standards which also both just happen to represent 2/3 of the both the worlds biggest rain forests and water basins. And still once it's mined it still has to be transported along with other raw materials, energy used during manufacture and then they finished cell has to be shipped.

I am one of the most lefty and green people I know (I would Trotsky was just a little too right wing for my tastes) and I used to read Red Pepper while at uni but that lack of intelligence and even handedness that article shows really annoys me.

What actually needs to happen, in my opinion, is teachers need to be chosen far more rigorously. There are some marvelous teachers in the state-system but there are also people who become teachers because it's a middle class job and gives decent pay, not because they have a passion for teaching, and they won't help students at all.

&gt;I think it needs to be more like how medical school students are chosen, where if they pick up even a hint that you want to be a doctor for the money or because your parents expect it of you, you basically get a red cross scrawled over your name. 

That's nice, but unless you can significantly increase the salary and the social respect associated with teaching, you'll never attract candidates in the way professions like medicine and law can. Some people have a pasison for teaching and will find there way into the profession regardless, but there aren't enough of them to teach our swelling population, and there just isn't enough money to attract brillaint people to fill in those gaps.

Thus, exams become less about what you've learnt in a year's worth of lessons but rather about the skills you have in writing an essay in an hour, completely forgetting that universities look for knowledge and ability in learning.

I did a physics a-level paper last week, you had to know to do that, obtaining the graph of velocity against time from the equation for displacement against time.

displacement [x] = Acos(2`pi`F)T  
velocity = `dy/dx` = -A(2`pi`FT)sin(2`pi`F)T  
= -2`pi`FAsin(2`pi`F)T

Which gives you a sin graph where 2`pi`FA `&gt;=` X `&gt;=` -2`pi`FA

Then draw the graph using the value given, remembering that it's always in radians.

As for GM it's been necessary since the 1970s when [Norman Borlaug](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug) developed semi-dwarf disease resistant  wheat varieties for which he got a Nobel Prize. His efforts have been credited with saving one billion people from starvation and the Nobel Prize he was awarded was not a science award - he got the Peace Prize for his work on ending world hunger. In fact the reason we have any variety of crops at all is due to artificial selection - ie farms choosing to sow the seeds of the higher producing crops over generations until it becomes a different variety.

The world's population has almost doubled in the last 40 years and isn't slowing down. In order to keep up with the demands this increase is placing on food production we either need to find new land to farm or increase the yield on land that is already being farmed. To increase the yield you either need to develop better nitrogen fixation or grow plants which require less nitrogen to produce crops. The anti-GM brigade is the left-wing's equivalent of climate change deniers - insisting there isn't a problem, no action needs to be taken and dismissing the science out of hand.

true,mr_dr_professor,null,null,"I respectfully disagree but also agree with a couple of your points. Here is what I would do. 

1. I would keep Al Habsi, he has been carrying a shoulder injury and as we have seen, he is a capable keeper. However, if someone comes in with a decent offer, he can be sold. Lee Nicholls demonstrated last season in Northampton that he is a very capable keeper, and I would actually loan him out to get experience, preferably in league 1. 

2. I agree with our defensive situation. There has to be some new signings in that department. Figgy is a big loss in my opinion, because he was pretty solid in the back but was also good going up, and had a sweet shot. As far as I know, we are looking at certain options to strengthen in the back. Names like Jordi Amat have been thrown around, and I hope we get him. He was a solid player in la Liga, young (he is still 21) and has a [sweet shot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAYyv54AdZA). There are a couple of free agents and players in their last year of their contract that we could perhaps persuade. For the right side, we do have Campabadal, who is very young and seemed pretty good in the Villa game. I disagree with the idea that we should get rid of Caldwell. The guy is a natural leader and although it is true he did not have the best of seasons last year, we should keep him. He revealed that last season he was battling through injury the entire season, which would explain why Roberto would take him out after 60 minutes. I think he still has a lot to offer and before that, he showed that he can excel in a back three. Also, we have to remember that we are getting Ramis back. He seemed like a very good defender who also scored goals. He will seem like a new signing.

3. In the midfield, I think it is a done deal that we will lose McCarthy. I want him to stay so bad, but the boy is too good to play in the Championship. The good news is that we should make 15-20 million pounds from his sale. This will help in investing in the areas we need support. I think there are a couple of young players that can step up. Fyvie for example, seemed very good in the couple of games that he played. We also still have Espinoza, Watson, and young Redmond. John Bostock, the former Tottenham youngster is available on a free so we may take a look at him. There are other quality midfielders also available on frees.

4. Keeping Maloney for me is instrumental. He has been arguably the best player last year and is the man who makes the difference in the team. His dribbling, passing and set piece ability makes him a vital part of our promotion push.

5. I think it would be a mistake to actively push to sell Kone. Unless we get a good offer, Kone has offered something the team has not had in a long time: a consistent goal scorer. His physicality and touch have helped score many goals last season and I think that keeping him would be a plus. If we do lose him, then getting a goal scorer should be the priority.

6. I think our current playing style is the best style for Wigan. Last year unfortunately in certain matches, we were unable to close them. Also the injuries in the back took its toll. When you don't have your traditional back three for practically the entire season, the team will suffer. But the current playing style allows the team to successfully transition to a very attacking team to a sound defensive structure when the players understand and execute their role. The cup games we played against Championship teams, we looked very solid and in control using that style, hence why I think we might be successful in the Championship using it. Also, we seem to be implementing it throughout all the teams, including the youngest ones. Having an identity established helps younger players ease into the first team, which is good because we can promote homegrown talent.

* There is a belief, held by **some** (i.e. BY NO MEANS ALL) nurses that portrays the profession as some last stoic line of defense in an ailing NHS. It conjurs images of nursing as a resillient, noble and selfless profession - under attack from every direction (hence NHS victimisation complex). My original point (relating the popularity of these posters in nursing staff rooms) is that I suspect it is because the poster resonates with that mentality.

* It is widespread in the sense that you'll find the attitude in Glasgow and you'll find it in Devon. It permeates within nursing as a profession, irrespective of location (though I will conceede it may well be more common in some places than others).

* I am pigeon holing by grouping all nurses into one contiguous group which clearly they aren't. BUT, none the less, the view **does** exist amongst certain NHS nurses, as other users have attested.

* The original Keep calm and Carry On posters have been popular in nursing staff rooms for some time (before they became popular elsewhere.)

We also have an answer for this. Two members of the Galifrey High Counsil were made to stand in shame like 'the weeping angels of old' as Rassilon initiated the ascension. There was opposition - but not enough to make a difference.

Look - obviously they could throw in some new, 'shocking' detail to the Time War mythos and make that Hurt's backstory. Until we see it on screen, they'll always have that liberty.

But I wouldn't say we were 'well in control' of finances, although it has certainly improved in recent years. Winning the CL and EL in previous seasons has certainly helped, but it doesn't change the fact that we have the 2nd highest wage bill in the PL - a position which it does look like the club is trying to change. Mata receives under 70k a week, whereas Torres reportedly receives 175k a week. Which one has offered more to the club in the time that they have been here? I think most people would answer Mata.

Don't get me wrong, I really love watching him play when he's performing. But quite simply, he doesn't justify the wages he receives and it would be much better to cut our losses now, take all the money we can for him and have a better striker taking advantage of the £175k wage bill slot he would leave behind.

There isn't really a set standard in international law as to what exactly is a declaration of war anymore, and most conflicts don't have anything so formal. Really any aggressive act by one state against another can be considered an act of war and therefore a form of declaration of war. Both arming insurgent forces and (even more certainly) imposing no-fly zones are such acts. 

Also you seem to assume that the Iran/Syrian axis is entirely passive in this whole affair. That's clearly not the case, and if they choose to fire off missiles, for example, at western forces, then those forces will be in war. It could also happen by accident - mortar fire and other projectiles have fallen across the border from Syria on numerous occasions, if this happens and western forces die as a result, I doubt they'll just sit there and take it. In other words, wars are not always planned affairs, but most often are a series of escalations that spiral out of control. Such a large exercise, along with the permanent placement of US troops on the border, is a clear escalation. Western generals and politicians will surely know that this increases the chances of a clash along the border, and will be preparing for the possibility of being dragged into the War.

The 2005 series is a very logical starting point in my opinion. The show makes sense when you start from there, because everything is explained in those first few episodes, and Classic Who is, for the most part, separate from it. They don't totally depend on each other and you can get (nearly) everything out of the 2005 series without having seen anything previous.

A bit daft, but I would agree, it wasn't particularly harmless. And it could have been solved had both parties - including Mr. Hunt, acted professionally.

&gt;When the manager called me, I was driving and I got increasingly exasperated as he kept telling me I should admit to my wrongdoing for referring to bacon sandwiches. In the end I told him to ‘sod off’ and put the phone down. 

All he had to do, was explain he was driving, explain the accusation of racism was both mis-guided - and extremely distressing to him, and ask to speak to the company, and if possible, the person involved in his recruitment. By the mans own admission, he explained he got increasingly exasperated, and told them to ""sod off"". That alone, isn't going to put someone in a position to want to discuss the issue with him.

There's a lot to this story that isn't being reported. Who made the claim of racism? Why is the name of the person who interviewed him - and her photo, being flashed around on social media / articles on other sites? What ""other comments"" did Mr. Hunt make during his call from his phone, that were deemed inappropriate by Reed?

&gt;I'm actually disgusted. And some of the comments in here saying the man is stupid, respect other cultures you fucking morons, this includes your own.

Have you read some of the comments being left, in the direction of the woman who inteviewed him?

&gt;I've seen photographs of her on another site, and she did not have her hair covered, she was in a restaurant where there were wine glasses and bottles on the tables (although it's not clear what the content of the bottles were).

What does that have to do with anything?

&gt;Very unprofessional of her to bring her religion into a business metting, A totally innocent offer of a bacon sandwich is in no way racist and he deserves a formal apology from her. I actually consider her the racist party in this situation.

At what point did she bring Religion into the recruitment process? Again, based on the DM article, it was a senior manager at Reed who made the phonecall, not the lady in question. Who knows that she wa the one who made the complaint? How often do you get interviewed by one person?

true,coolbeaNs92,eng-Surrey,Surrey,"Cheers for calling me a ""fucking idiot"" I guess. 

But let's take a look at this....

The cheapest Galaxy SIII I can find (from a reputable source) is £319.00 from Asda. Now, let's say I get a sim only plan from the cheapest place around (giffgaff) for £12 that has all my required minutes and data. I would keep the phone for at least two years as I never really require that latest smartphone (I had my 3GS for four years), so....

£319 + £12*24 (the 24 months I would pay for my line rental sim only = £607 for two years. 

Now, let's look at the contract I'm looking at for Tesco. £22 a month for a free Galaxy S III with a more than enough minutes and data I require. 

£22* 24 (the contract length) = £528 (a £79 saving). 

So, in answer to you statement, how am I an idiot for considering saving £79 a year? True, you can way the pro/con's of having no contracts and leaving any time, but why would I leave? I'm currently paying £20 for a sim only, 1 month rolling contracting at the moment. I'm not the type of person to upgrade after a year and always want the latest phone, and as a student, an initial investment of £319 is a lot of money.

This isn't a proper examination. A real examination will test you on topics that you need to understand. The harder A level exams will do this properly. 


The real reason that there was a massive row over the grade boundaries was because teachers had factored in grade inflation into their marking for mock assessments, and therefore had come to the conclusion that every successive year you could achieve less and get the same grade, particularly for the grade C/D boundary which is the only boundary most schools care about with league tables. 


That is why I said that maths is a real GCSE because it actually tests your understanding: you can't memorise the same question that has come up before, but have to understand the topic being asked.

In this area of London there is a big undercurrent of racism, and they've got a big presence.My sister and her boyfriend were brutally attacked in Mottingham a couple of years ago for being a mixed race couple (her back was so fucked that she's only just going back to work now), and they threw eggs at my parents windows when her boyfriend was living with them. That's their kids, learning from their parents a warped idea of whats going on in the world and whats right, and thats the new wave of EDL. I find it astonishing that people can live in such a culturally diverse area and still think like this.

I'm not saying they're all like that, I imagine they're not all extremist arseholes but that's the image they give off. The thing at the Mosque is a better way to go about it, but from what I see that is the Islamic community making the effort to try and change peoples opinion.
