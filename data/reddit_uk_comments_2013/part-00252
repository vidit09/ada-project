Equally, Scottish MPs in a new independent Scotland will have responsibilities to those they represent. The SNP seem very intent on insisting that the rest of the UK will have to act one way or another, but that just isn't how it will (or should) work. 

I love Scotland, and I'd hate to see the remainder of the UK do anything malicious in negotiations simply out of spite (I don't believe that would happen mind). But any decisions on the UK side of negotiations would surely be from what is best for the UK. I personally think that would leave both Scotland and the new UK weaker entities, though I also think (and I'm sure you'd disagree) that it would hurt Scotland even more. 

That's not the reason I'd like to see Scotland stay in though. Whether one or both sides would be financially better off isn't really relevant to me. I hate the economic arguments. They seem so callous and selfish and cold and petty. I care as much about the wellbeing of Scotland as I do England. I don't want polices that benefit England, or cut my taxes. I want policies that benefit the UK and a tax system that is fair (which frankly means raising taxes on the better off) for the benefit of all. 

The nationalist arguments on both sides are divisive and, to my kind, unrealistic in their promises.

I've seen it in many places other than Reddit and I've always found it curious that many of the arguments are ""The entire HISTORY of the show has been ruined!"" Yet, it's almost always something to do with a plot point in the 8 last years. If you want to argue that it effects your enjoyment of the new episodes, then sure, I can get on board with that. If that's your extent of the show, then yes, I can easily see why your view on the show could change drastically after the 50th. But when I've seen this argument on more than one occasion this year, and I'm not saying this about /u/rexregumrex at all, I've seen the something along the lines of ""well, I started watching during Tennant and I've seen (some number less than 5) of the classic Who"", or in some cases none at all. Then they proceed to say how the entire show history of the show has been ruined by something that just happened. 
Granted, I'm not saying that you have to watch Classic Who to be able to weigh in, not at all. I've been watching for about 32 years and I LOVE to see all the people who now watch it. I'm happy others love it so much. I'm just saying that if you're gonna say something as big as the 50 history has changed, you gotta give at least one solid example from prior to 2005.

How people choose to describe themselves is their choice, but whilst the word retains mostly negative connotations I will not use it. For me it is one of those terms that people may choose to apply to themselves in group if they wish but outsiders have no business using.

It is accurate to call someone from Afghanistan an Afghan because that is the correct demonym - Afghanistan means 'land of the Afghans' 

But the 'Pak' in Pakistan comes from an acronynm 'Punjab Afghanistan and Kashmir' - and Pakistan means 'the land of Punjab, Afganistan and Kashmir'  so there are no such people as 'the Paks' or 'the Pakis' that's why you should say 'Pakistani' because that means 'people from the country of Pakistan'

Defamation is the only area of civil law in the UK where it is routine to have a jury trial, the defendant doesn't have to prove the allegations are false as far as I'm aware. The real kicker is that the UK doesn't seem recognise jurisdictional limits for defamation and will issue injunctions where they believe there has been a breach of privacy. 

These injunctions are ridiculous to the point where even talking about the case can be contempt of court and MPs have been known to resort to parliamentary privilege to stop some of the more ridiculous ones. 

There is civil legal aid in the UK although it has been significantly restricted really and is not available in areas where no win no fee is common like motoring. 

As far as unjust settlements go the UK has its issues but there are two ways I would say it is better than the US:
1) Loser pays the other sides fees, this stop people proceeding with frivolous law suits in an attempted to bankrupt the other side. 
2) You can only get damages awarded for actual loss. Not hurt feelings or as a punishment. As jury trials effectively don't exist in civil law the amount is decided on actual loss by a judge.

true,SockBramson,null,null,"I was genuinely worried that with all the build up and over-analyzing that I wouldn't enjoy this. But I did about as thoroughly as I could have.

I mean honestly, think about this from a writer's perspective. You want to re-open the idea of the Gallifrey and the other timelords but your story is steeped in rules that prevent it. What Moffat did was about as brilliant a job of doing that as any imagination could muster. He brought back the fantastical, the impossible, while still following many of the rules that held it in place. If anyone thinks they could have done a better job I'd love to read it.

The episode hit as many nods to the show as I could've hoped for. When Ten said, ""I don't want to go,"" it was perfect. Written in a proper context, delivered in a way that gave the slightest wink to the fans without feeling forced or cheesy.

Bringing back Tom Baker? How do you bring back an actor that looks nothing like he did when he was on the show but still the same character? Well Moffat did it, and he did it in a clever way that wasn't jarring and flirted with, but didn't break the fourth wall. Baker's performance was nothing short of brilliant.

My favorite part of the special was just a look. The moment when Hurt figures out how to get into the Black Archive without landing the TARDIS. At that moment it truly felt like he was the Doctor. The best part was when 11 and 10 look at each other as if to say, ""Get a load of this guy! How brilliant is he?"" That look made the special for me.

I'm not saying it was perfect, for example the moment when Hurt says, ""Thank you Bad Wolf girl!"" was strange. Tennant and Smith look confused and gravely concerned but the subject is immediately changed. It felt bizarre that this was brought up but never addressed. I feel that either it was explored but was cut, or this will be addressed in the future. Remember the moment took the form of Rose Tyler, so he/she/it could take any form in the future.

What I learned from the special was that Doctor Who is an amazing show because it allows a writer to fix almost anything. Going back to 10's, ""I don't wanna go,"" line. I've heard many fans say they despise this as his last words. Now it's seemingly fixed. This special added more context and makes all the Tennant-specials seem fitting. So it's nice to be reminded that anything you see wrong today could easily be resolved tomorrow.

I know I'm just gushing here but this really was amazing to me. I remember hearing the line in the trailer, ""Great men are forged in fire; it is the privilege of lesser men to ignite the flame."" I thought, wow that's a great line. But the entire conversation leading to that was so well written I was honestly floored.

So many perfect moments, nods to the past, and some tiny flaws. The Smith/Baker conversation that was both a touching nod to the past and a chilling glimpse to set up the future of the show.

I mean, we don't actually see war doctor turn into 9 (10? fuck they fucked my numbering system all up now). We must assume that the war doctor turns into 9. I really wanted to see Christopher Eccleston pop in with a cameo (no matter the hype surrounding him and the Who rift), but since I don't get that, I must assume that all went according to plan.  The doctor leaving his own timestream would be a waste of screen time (FOR THIS EPISODE not in general!  I would like to see it because I'm just as curious as you) because it doesn't advance THIS story. All we NEED to know is the Doctor and Clara made it out. While, yes, it would have been cool to see them get out, I would have been sitting there being like, Why am I not seeing the War Doctor and Gallifrey and the Time War? Why am I seeing something that could be assumed? Its not about what would be cool, its about advancing a story line.  When I suspend disbelief  I find that the biggest disappointments I receive are from my own expectations going into the viewing.  If I really want to see something and do not receive it then I am inevitably going to find disappoint. I think that is why a lot of people get let down during heavily hyped projects.

A while ago you posted:     
&gt; I love the idea of passing knowledge onto another, helping generations understand and, in particular, seeing kids grasp/form new ideas.        

Also, you seem to like Harry Potter, whilst also being fairly critical toward the later films.      

I was thinking something along the lines of **Sharing past experiences with others.**       
So lets say you're thinking about a girl you just spoke to down the hallway, you had a good conversation and she's quite pretty. You bump into another friend (lets call him barry) and she's still on your mind as you shake hand with him.       
***Whoosh!!!***     
Everything fades to black, then fades back to where you were in the hallway just two minutes ago. You notice another you on your right, chatting with that pretty girl from before. You turn back and see Barry, still clutching your hand. You let go.        
***Whoosh!!!*** Everything fades to black for a second and then you're both back in the room.

I assumed he was American because you don't see that many bandwagon Spurs fans from Britain. Not because Brits aren't bangwagoners, but because most people who follow football in the UK (aside from existing Spurs fans) know that Spurs are a small club with delusions of grandeur. Why on earth would a glory hunter want to support them? Glory hunters over here support the big clubs, the clubs that will actually win things. Whereas a new American fan who is perhaps not as knowledgeable about the game will see Gareth Bale scoring a wonder goal, and that American hero Clint Dempsey, and think ""hey, these Totting-ham Hotspurs are a pretty neat team"", not knowing any better. Now that Bale has moved on, and Dempsey has been found out, those kinds of fans are probably a bit more reluctant.

(edit): Spurs fans over here have certainly gotten a lot louder. But I doubt very highly that their out of character 'success' in recent seasons has won them many new fans this side of the Atlantic. Like I said, the kind of fan who would start supporting a club with new-found success is probably already supporting United, City, Chelsea or Arsenal.

But he can't know, otherwise paradoxes would pop up everywhere because a lot of what he's done is from the pain of losing Gallifrey. So the new viewers, up until ""Day of the Doctor"", will still feel something for him but it'll be a different something.

You're missing the point with Clara coming up with the solution rather than The Moment. If the moment could've come up with the solution, the special would've been a lot shorter because she could've told The War Doctor everything he needed to know. But it wasn't about that. It was about all parties involved coming to the solution on their own. The Doctors couldn't have thought up that because they've accepted the doom of Gallifrey for a few minutes, a few years, and a few hundred years. Clara could make an outside suggestion because she's from the outside. She knows The Doctor as a problem-solver and to see him as someone who can't solve a problem that THREE Doctors can't must've been agony.

The show wasn't rewritten. Everything up until ""Day of the Doctor"" has still happened. Gallifrey is gone, just not in the way it was originally. ""End of Time"" takes place shortly before ""Day of the Doctor"", so the horrors of Rassilon still apply. The pain of The Doctor is still there, he just gets a happy(ish) ending. Gallifrey coming back isn't as pleasant at it may seem at first. Yes, it's back, but when it eventually breaks out of the painting, it's not gonna be in a good place. The snapshot took place just as the Daleks were about to decimate it. I imagine that Gallifrey will be a bit like Russia just after WWII.

Eriksen is not average, he's well above average and as far as chance creation I think he's up there with the best in the league, except for Stevie who's obliterating everybody ;).

Without extensive and somewhat arcane knowledge, I don't see how. Perhaps you can explain to me exactly why ""coloured"" is considered to be offensive, since the reason that I'm aware of is not consistent with the acceptability of ""people of colour"" in any context, conversational or academic.  

&gt;Black or Asian seem to be the word primarily used for racial minorities in the UK.  

Sure, for many people, but that wasn't always the case, and isn't always the case; for instance, older black British people will have grown up with ""coloured"" as a neutral term and may well not be bothered in the least.

Currently, the OED has a usage note under ""black"" that warns you off ever capitalising the word because it ""can have connotations of either respect or disrespect depending on the context and writer"".

true,nxtm4n,whisperman,Whisperman,"&gt; How did they get out of the Doctor's time stream?

Agreed, this is my major gripe with it.

&gt; the three Doctors interacting. Usually, this would cause a giant paradox, but Matt and David both seem really nonchalant about it all.

Different Doctors have interacted before. The keyword is *different* Doctors. As long as they're different incarnations of the Doctor, then the timeline just fuzzes his memory of it while he's going through it for the second and third (and so on) times. When the Ninth Doctor was in the same place as himself and saw himself in Series 1, that was a paradox because it was the same incarnation, and perhaps also because Rose saw herself as well. But different incarnations can work with themselves fine, and have many times in the past.

&gt; Now we have his Doctor in the point of his life where he knows he is going to die soon (this happens, supposedly, right before the End of Time)

Actually, it happens at some unspecified point before the End of Time and after Journey's End - at some point during the three specials aired before the End of Time. His attitude is very similar to his attitude in Planet of the Dead in particular.

&gt; As for Hurt, both Matt and David were incredibly buddy buddy with him.

While neither specifically says it, I'm pretty sure that they both figured out that he hasn't used the Moment yet pretty quickly. That was the major event which made the Doctor hate himself as the War Doctor. Thus, they don't really have a problem with him - just that they know he *will* do it, and they both still believe that they've done it as well.

&gt; As for the Time War itself, that is the biggest let down to me.

Again, I agree that the Time War was a bit of a let-down, but we only saw one battle of it, the Dalek's attacking Gallifrey. I'd have liked for the War Council to be talking about another incredibly dangerous monster that they're worried the Daleks will employ, or say something along the lines of ""At least we finally took down the Nightmare Child"". Something that makes it seem bigger than this one battle.

&gt; I feel like the Doctor saving gallifrey was a giant cop-out... The Moment was such a great part of the Doctor's tragedy which is now moot for Matt and Capaldi.

Yup. No arguments from me there. But just because he didn't have to make that hard decision doesn't mean he's not still a complex character. Remember, even though he now remembers that he never actually did it, he still remembers that he made the choice and the decision to do it in the first place - and then twice more, as 10 and 11. He'll likely have that on his mind as he becomes 13, remembering that he was still willing to kill his entire race, even when he was the Doctor. There has to be a reason that Capaldi sounded so angry...

&gt; the Zygones. They just dropped that entire plot point without ever really resolving it.

No, they don't really show us the result of it, but that doesn't mean it wasn't resolved. They show us the negotiations getting underway. Just because we don't hear about how they end doesn't leave it unresolved, really - getting them to negotiate instead of fighting *was* a resolution.

&gt; Gallifrey is ""back"" (the Master, anyone?)

This excites me too, but just a reminder that the Doctor still needs to find Gallifrey before he can bring it back. The Master is stuck there from End of Time though, yes, which means he'll be back along with the rest of the Time Lords.",0,1385326134,null,0,false,0,cdm2djo,t3_1rd7w6,t1_cdm2djo,t3_1rd7w6,null,1428524414,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,Kirbychu,null,null,"1. Lots of people have concerns about this, but the easiest answer is that they just got out between episodes. It's not the first time the Doctor has gotten out of a bind off-screen, and it allowed the special to start off in a way that better represented the history of the show, with a semi-reproduction of the intro to An Unearthly Child.

2. The Doctor meeting his past selves is not a new thing. The Three Doctors, The Five Doctors, The Two Doctors, and Time Crash are all multi-Doctor stories, and none of them have had reality-bending paradoxes. They even explain that the timeline interference was cause by The Moment, and because things got so mixed up Hurt and Tennants Doctors wouldn't remember what happened.

3. They act kind to him because he is still the Doctor. You can see they still have a hard time trusting him all through the episode, but he still has the warm heart and intelligence of all of the Doctors, which is what shows during the times they interact.

4. This episode is set on the very final day of the Time War. All those things that had been described happened over the course of centuries. Now they've all passed, the universe is at the brink, and the Doctor has to make his final decision. You can't expect them to show us the entirety of a war that lasted for hundreds of years throughout all of hypertime in the course of a 75 minute tv program, so they focused on the one part that had the biggest impact on the Doctor as a character.

5. This is down to your personal opinion. I personally feel that this allows for the Doctor to evolve as a character, still coping with what he did during the Time War, but now without the guilt of how he had to end it, and the addition of having to now find his home and sort out what's left of it.

6. The Zygons weren't intended to be the central plot, but they did act as a very major plot device. They provided background and build-up for the Time Lord space-time cubes, which foreshadow the episode's ending.

&gt; The term was common parlance in the 1960s, but its origins are the problem, says Mr Agbetu. It comes from the ideology of racism, that white people are white, and everyone else is somehow other coloured. It fails to recognise that everyone has an ethnicity and is an inadequate ""one-size-fits all"" description.

&gt; Nor was it a term chosen by those it refers to, but instead imposed by the wider - and white - society.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6132672.stm

""coloured"" was used in everyday conversation. POC is not, it is used in academic circles to refer to shared experiences of racism. Now the same criticisms made in that article could be made towards the term POC, except that term was coined for highlighting racialization and discussing shared experiences of racism, and was chosen by racial minorities, whereas as referring to people as ""coloured"" in everyday conversation harkens back to a more racist time. You wouldn't use POC in the same way that people used ""coloured"". Grouping all non white people together for POC actually works to it's advantage in academic discussion, as the focus was often before on a black-white binary, whereas POC allows shared experiences to be discussed. The point of the term POC is to group non-white people together, whereas that is not something that you'd really do in everyday conversation, you'd distinguish people by their own ethnicity.  

&gt; Because the term people of color includes vastly different people with only the common distinction of not being white, it draws attention to the fundamental role of racialization in the United States. It acts as ""a recognition that certain people are racialized"" and serves to emphasize ""the importance of coalition"" by ""making connections between the ways different 'people of color' are racialized.""[11] As Joseph Truman explains, the term people of color is attractive because it unites disparate racial and ethnic groups into a larger collective in solidarity with one another

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color

Again, it's primarily a US term that is also used here in feminist and academic circles. You wouldn't use POC or ""coloured"" in everyday conversation, and generally news articles in the UK don't use those either, it has a more specific use in academic discussions of shared racism between people who aren't white.

So in everyday conversation people wouldn't use POC or ""coloured"", they'd use black or Asian.

If may be neutral for white older people, but it generally isn't for older people from racial miniorities. ""Negro"" was normal for some even older people as a neutral term, and wasn't always meant in an insulting way, but you generally wouldn't catch people using it now. 

Yeah black doesn't tend to be capitalized unless it's the start of a sentence, but I don't think people will make too much of a fuss over that. 

Really, unless you're entering academic and/or feminist discussions that are about shared racism, as opposed to racism faced by one race, black and Asian would be used, with no use of coloured at all, whether ""coloured people"" or ""people of colour"". It's still more of a US term, and you could still use black or Asian in more formal discussions here. You can't really go wrong in the UK with ""black"" or ""Asian"".

true,NEWSBOT3,cnty-uk,Londontown,"In order for the situation to change there needs to be a massive reduction in rent and selling prices. For that, there needs to be a oversupply of housing, but we are actually not building enough for the people we have needing them.


Additionally, increased energy prices (they've increased by 15% on average each year for the past 23 years and counting), mean that rent of houses that include bills will also increase.

Increased interest rates in a few years time (Bank of England estimate 2016/17) will make mortgages even more expensive for people, which will in turn push up rent prices further.


At the same time as this happens there'll be more jobs and higher wages available as the economy recovers, which means more people will be able to get mortages even if they are more expensive, which increases housing demand and the prices will go up even more.


People keep speculating that the housing bubble has to end, but I cant see how. If it was powered by a single factor that might be true, but the only thing i can see dropping house prices are government backed policies which would be massive unpopular with large sections of the voting public. (anything that decreases property values will be massively opposed by owners, anything that limits rent will also be opposed etc).


The only way i can see this changing as if we accept a radical change in what a home means. Things like [homes built from shipping containers](http://design-milk.com/12-homes-made-from-shipping-containers/) could drop costs massively (iirc 2 beds can be made from them for a [total cost of 50k in London](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/9243318/Container-living-a-home-for-under-50000.html), probably cheaper elsewhere - but the problem is that most people wouldnt like to live in them.

Technology such as 3D printing might advance enough that you could potentially print your own house etc, but theres no guarantee that those could or will work out - and if they do, you can guarantee massive opposition from both construction companies and local councils (who receive huge amounts of money from house building projects) which would need to be overruled somehow.

I'm planning to have to rent until I die - it might be possible that I could own a house one day, but I cant guarantee it and it would be unwise to not cover both options.

Cloud mining in general seems to be a threat to the network in that it centralises hashpower and gives you little control over how it's used; that thread is about how cex.io/ghash.io's power was used (either with or without cex.io's knowledge; they plead innocence) for three days to execute a double-spend attack.  While that's possible in pool mining too (Eligius hashpower has historically been used in opinionated ways; twice to [suffocate](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=56802.0) . [altcoins](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=56675.0), and today to [discourage address re-use](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=334316.0) today; personally I'm indifferent about the suffocation and approve of the discouragement) at least with your own hardware you can switch pools.  With cex.io's hired hardware model you have to buy out the smallest quantum (an ASIC board) to get it removed and put towards a pool you agree with.  While you can sell a partial share of a board to someone else, in that case it's guaranteed to continue to be used in ways you object to.

I'll leave you with a [quote from gmaxwell](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=327767.msg3584644#msg3584644):

&gt; I haven't seen anything to commend except their business savvy:
&gt;
&gt; Hashrate on their service is &gt;2x more expensive than actually buying the hardware— more like 10x the price of stuff still in pre-order, and will never make a profit at those prices according to the calculator on their site. By doing so they centralize mining and create a moral hazard with apparent results like the one's we've seen here.

* Brendan Rodgers still has a long way to go tactically. Of our last games, we were tactically very poor against Southampton, Newcastle and Everton but also tactically superb against Arsenal, WBA and Fulham. While I agree that Brendan Rodgers' off-the-pitch approach is brilliant, he needs to improve in the tactical department. I won't complain about our current position in the league but we could have more points if he had gotten the tactics right. 

* While Lucas still blows hot and cold after his lengthy injury, he currently is very much needed in our midfield. I wouldn't say no to an improvement/upgrade though. 

* I don't think Agger deserves to start over Sakho.

On the other matches:

A lot of matches went in our favour. This was also the case 2 weeks ago. This is also why we are still second of the table. This won't last forever but I am glad that once in a while, lady luck befriends also us.

Point one: the Moment coming up with the solution wouldn't have made the show any shorter, because the point of the Moment is Dickensian, showing people the error of their ways through viewing different portions of their lives, past, present and future. Obviously, if there were a way to fix this particular locked moment in time, the Doctor would have considered it by now. Adding that 11 had thought of a way around this, wouldn't the Moment have known he had these thoughts? She/it can see every thought the Doctor has ever had, it would have made sense for her to bring it up, especially after she stops Hurt from pushing the button to hear that the sound of the Tardis 'brings hope to all who hear it'. The arrival of the other incarnations of the Doctor, and then the Moment revealing that 11 had an idea of how to stop it, would have been completely natural.

Point two: Yes, everything up to this moment has still happened.

The internet is one big huge spoiler for any new fan to be wary of, and there's bound to be a few people who will *start* their journey with the 50th anniversary episode, as fans share it with their friends as an introductory episode to whet new peoples' appetites. Or they're going to find discussion of it online. In either case, they know already that the pain and loss the Doctor carries will resolve itself later. It's kind of like knowing that the Face of Boe is Captain Jack before watching the big reveal. It takes something away from it. This is just on a much larger scale.

Do you recognise that the first two paragraphs are filled with arcane knowledge and less-than-obvious reasoning? Relatively few people are going to know who ""chose"" the word ""coloured"". They may will be aware of expressions like ""people of colour"", and may well have no idea that they are academic expressions. I certainly didn't come across the expression in an academic context, and it's very familiar to me.

In addition, most of the things that you and Toyin Agbetu say about ""coloured"" are also true of ""black"". It reduces a person to a physical property. It strips them of their ethnicity (which is obviously a lot more nuanced than ""African"" for most black British people), and groups together many people with very disparate backgrounds. It has been used both neutrally and in the context of racial abuse, and was in common parlance in a more racist time. It was not conceived by the people who it's applied to. Fundamentally, the only difference is that most people who are described as ""black"" are ok with being described as ""black"", whereas the same isn't true for ""coloured"", and you either know that or you don't. Not everybody does.  

If you've read all of my comments on the thread, you'll know that you don't need to keep telling me that ""black"" and ""Asian"" are commonly used and accepted. I'm well aware of that, and they're the terms that I'd use if I needed to. The point is that not everybody does know that, and the people who do not know that are not necessarily racist.

Regenerating beyond 12 times is possible, but (more!) unpredictable and dangerous. 

the plotline of ""The Five Doctors' was all about President Borusa of Gallifrey seeking the Tomb of Rassilon to obtain Immortality (which turned out to be a cruel joke), with the implication that Rassilon himself determined the 12-regens limitation during his creation of Timelord society.

The Doctor of course, is The Doctor because he never really gave much credence to Timelord Law in the first place however - he pretty much has a moral obligation (in his mind) to break the 12 regeneration limit, if it prevents him from doing what he has to do.

Iv been wondering about this a lot lately. In the last few years there have been many cyclists deaths that have resulted in national news - often due to driver being found not guilty.

I don't want to really go into the cases (no point and not relevant to my or your point). But it has occurred to me is a judge and a jury have no or little understanding of cyclists, and of course by default they are all drivers the outcome is often (it would seem) a forgone conclusion.

And in relation to that Iv often wondered if that driver would think the jury fair if it was made of of nothing but cyclists?

You can apply this thinking to anything - and if that's true, no minority group that's not represented fairly in a jury will never get a fair trial.

Feel is the operative word.  People feel there are too many people living in this country.  People feel hospitals are being overrun with immigrants and people coming over here to have babies.   People feel the unemployed should be made to do more for their benefits.   People feel Europe is bad for us.   They feel this and they feel that but when you push them on it they have no factual evidence to back up their statement beyond ""That's just the way it is!""

Feel != Understanding of an issue.  People in general do not understand word one of a complex issue like benefits reform, modernisation &amp; automation of the system and so on.  

Just like they have no idea that we also take subsidies from the EU for various things (and on a few occasions we've taken more than we've put in) nor how it'd affect our trade relations with the rest of the world. 

And before anyone calls bullshit, my mother-in-law, pensioner and always votes whilst near religiously watches the BBC News and reads, you guessed it, the Daily Mail has said all of those ""I feel that..."" lines within the last six months.

Furthermore, if someone with access to the internet was unsure of what to use, the information can be found in 5 minutes. I doubt anyone thinks that racial minorities chose to be called ""coloured"". POC is not a particularly common expression here in the UK. 

Coloured was used to group all non white people together though and separate them from white people, whereas black and Asian do not group all non white people together. They aren't perfect descriptors by any means, as white is still not a perfect descriptor of all Caucasian people but they avoid the ""white-everyone else"" binary. Black reduces someone to a physical property in the same way that white does, the main point of the article by Agbetu was ""It comes from the ideology of racism, that white people are white, and everyone else is somehow other coloured."" Black doesn't perfectly describe all black people, but it's better than ""coloured."" But yeah the fact that black people are fine with being called black is pivotal; if ""coloured"" was generally accepted by black people as the preferred term, than that would probably be the better term to use.

Most people know it's not ok to use ""coloured"" now, and if you're older and don't, people can kindly point out it's not the preferred term now.

true,87red,null,null,"I'm in a similar situation.  Just had 4 winter tyres put on at a garage of a nationwide tyre fitter. The winter tyres have been used for 2 winters and are in very good condition. After dropping the summer tyres that had just come off to be stored in the parents garage, we set off home and within 6 miles (~15 mins) one of the tyres suddenly deflated on an A-road.

Luckily there was a lay-by within 200 yds so we pulled in there and put the spare on and limped the rest of the journey home.  Today I went to another well-known tyre place that was open Sundays to see what could be done as we need the car repaired asap for my partner to get to work. They examined the tyre and instantly found the valve to be at fault, and running for that short distance with no/low pressure had also irreparably damaged the inside wall of the tyre.

The place that fitted the tyres didn't provide any paperwork aside from the credit card receipt, in hindsight I should have questioned why they didn't provide any.  Until they open again tomorrow morning I don't know whether we'd paid for or if new values were fitted.

Anyway, their T&amp;C's say: ""As part of any Service ('means servicing or repairs that we carry out and includes inspections, Product fitting and servicing') we will carry out the inspections described in our Vehicle Health Check. We will then make a recommendation to you based on the inspection we have undertaken. *We will not start any work on the vehicle until you have signed our inspection report and any estimate we give*.

We will not be responsible for any loss or damage caused by anything which we did not find on our inspection *unless it should have been found by the actual inspection we conducted*. We shall not be responsible for conducting any other inspections.""

I didn't sign any inspection report or approve any estimate.  I simply asked for the winter tyres to be fitted and expected to pay a reasonable price.  I was told to return in 1hr and it would be done.  I'll ask tomorrow if they conducted the inspections.  Obviously we're not pleased at being placed in a dangerous situation and we're lucky that it wasn't worse, but is the tyre fitter at fault?

If they *did* replace the value, then I think it's likely that they are at fault considering a failure within 20 minutes of driving.  If they *didn't* replace the valve, I'd question why they didn't make us aware of a potentially dangerous fault with the tyre.  There is also the issue of consequential loss given that the tyre is now destroyed.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I have a solution to this, maybe it's already been thought of but it's been bouncing around in my head for a few months.

A housing cooperative.

Basic idea:

1) The housing cooperative is a non-profit corporation. It purchases properties which the coop members then rent.

2) As you pay rent, you earn equity. This equity the property's value amortized over a set period, exactly like a mortgage. A year of paying rent earns you 1/25th of the property's equity, minus upkeep expenses.

3) This equity is yours and is good on any property in the Coop. So if you have 250,000 pounds in equity, you can ""bid"" on any property that's available in the network and worth that much or less, and not pay rent at all. You earn nominal interest on any unused equity if you move into something cheaper than what you've ""paid off"". 

4) You can refinance your equity. So let's say  you paid off 20,000gbp on a 250,000gbp property, you can ""refinance"" and pay 1/25th of 230,000gbp in ""rent"" this year if you're having financial problems.

5) There are no credit checks or financing. There is a deposit however, just like renting a regular flat.

6) The coop uses the profits from stored equity to expand the Coop's holding of properties, providing more options for members.

7) To prevent abuses of the system, the earned equity is evaluated every year based on the value of the house after an inspection. So, if you trash your house, you lose your money.

This gets rid of the need for downpayments, the blood sucking interest payments to banks, and as the Coop property holdings approach 100% of the real estate market (ideally), the entire housing market insanity itself.",0,1385328831,null,0,1385330536,0,cdm3mb3,t3_1rd9ra,t1_cdm3mb3,t3_1rd9ra,null,1428523833,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

You're plan of sectioning of parades to be out of the way is silly and there are numerous reasons why:

- By putting parades out into the middle of no where the crowds will not be putting money into the community, county Armagh 12th revolves around the 12 districts, every dozen years you get the largest twelfth in the country and Protestants throwing money all round them. It was in Newtownhamilton this year, a predominantly nationalist village, and every pub was packed and the chippys had a great day of business.

- You're plan to limiting parades to 'appropriate' places will result in minority communities being unable to practice their culture in their own home towns, I live in the Newry area, there would be no hope in hell of me practising my culture in the place of my birth and the city where my family came from.

- By pushing the parades outside you are limiting them to their own cultural groups, there would be no sharing of cultural experiences, and no one will be learning anything about them. Ignorance leads to fear which leads to hate, not a viable long term solution.

But that wasn't what honey-badger was talking about, or the point to which I was responding. 

In terms of your point, the SNP have been fairly up front in their argument that they expect their prime economic game changers to be fiscal, not monetary.

It's more power than is had right now from their POV: right now they have neither monetary nor true fiscal levers (ie taxation and credit). 

I don't think one can convincingly argue that the economy of Scotland will play a bigger role in the decisions of the Bank of England MPC post independence than currently. It's a trivial to non-factor either way, and I think the history of UK monetary policy *strongly* bears that out. UK monetary policy has been South-East England monetary policy since Geoffrey Howe was chancellor. (I would be prepared to concede this shift primarily came under Lawson)

I'm not arguing for independence at all. I am entirely unconvinced by the notion. But I think the currency argument is a red herring. Worst case scenario they get no say, and the situation remains more or less the same. Best case scenario they get a Sterling zone with some kind of tangible role in the MPC, or at least the right to be consulted, and Holyrood is in fact better off.

That is exactly what is happening.

City and Chelsea both have these players who will dominate for years to come if they get even remotely close to their hype. The real City title challenge will be next season and Chelsea will also improve and really mount a challenge next season, this season they will fuck up like us and all the other teams because of so many changes. You will notice teams like Arsenal who are pretty much sticking with their old plan are at the top and that is a poor short term plan as they will at best get top 3 this season only to be blown out next season when the other team's long term plan comes into effect. 

We already beat them once and we can do it again. As for ""scary"", we will also look this scary against some teams but then slip up and so will City. These teams though are meant for the long term and United's squad for example is coming to an end where so many players are nearing the end.

The vast majority of single mothers (I would guess in excess of 80%) were in a steady relationship when they became pregnant. Is your goal to for more children to be raised in relationships which have become unhappy or abusive?

Young women do not get pregnant thinking they're going to live the life of riley on benefits - the most generous concession I can make your argument is that some think that getting up the duff will make their boyfriend settle down or get back with them. And those particular young ladies aren't behaving rationally, anyway.

The one factor that has been proven to reduce teenage pregnancies is educational opportunities.

I think that's an interesting distinction and it makes sense to me. However, I certainly don't think it's an obvious distinction unless you have it pointed out to you. It's muddied further by the fact that ""coloured"" has been used at times specifically to describe black people rather than anyone who isn't white, and that's before you even get into the meaning of the word in South African English.

&gt;It's acceptable because it doesn't have the same history.  

Yes, but this obviously only helps you if you know that history.

Just a quick addendum to the previous post:

&gt;I doubt anyone thinks that racial minorities chose to be called ""coloured"".

Have a quick glance back at the OED quote from earlier. African-Americans DID choose to be called ""colored"" post-emancipation. Consider also that we're living in an age where some black people have even appropriated the word ""nigger"", despite all of its history and connotations, and it's difficult to dismiss anything out of hand.

But like I said, she didn't like Sci-Fi, which is a HUGE part of my life (beyond being a Sci-Fi fan, I work on movie sets (I'm a Production Manager)).

And it wasn't just Doctor who, it was almost all ""sci-fi"".  Firefly, Star Wars, Star Trek, all of it.  She just ""hated"" the concept and idea of aliens completely, and would only watch Sci-fi if it definitely did not involve them, or if I watched a Twilight (or similar) movie with her.

It wasn't the primary reason, but it was the reason that made me look at our relationship and think if I could see myself with her long-term.  It also made me see some of the other things, such as she would never come visit me out Chicago, I had to always go visit her in the suburbs.  It was just a whole bunch of small reasons that, individually didn't seem too problematic, but when viewed together, seemed overwhelming, and it wasn't until I had the thought ""Can I really marry someone who is this much against Doctor Who"" that I saw them.

Yes kids fall over all the time but it's actually very very rare that they break themselves if there is an adult watching - this wasn't a grazed knee, this was a 6 year old girl being allowed to be in a position to crack her head open on a sharp object deliberately put in the playground.  

It's funny, people who don't come in contact with small children and whos only frame of reference is *being one* don't really realise how *small* they really are.  They only really start to get sturdy when they are 8 or 9 - looking at how tiny a 6 year old's fingers are will freak anyone out.

&gt; Have a quick glance back at the OED quote from earlier. African-Americans DID choose to be called ""colored"" post-emancipation. Consider also that we're living in an age where some black people have even appropriated the word ""nigger"", despite all of its history and connotations, and it's difficult to dismiss anything out of hand.

Good point, although that pertains to America and not to the UK. In the example of ""nigger"", it was re-appropriated by black people to be used among themselves as a term of endearment, not as term they chose to be called by other races as ""colored"" may have been in post-emancipation America. It's also generally spelt ""nigga"" when used in that way, dropping the hard r, as it sounds different in an American accent, (although this difference in sound isn't present with an English accent) 

Also unless they've grown up around lots of black people, and sometimes still not even then, it's not really ok for white people to use the word in that way. There are some black people who are fine with anyone using the word, but generally white people wouldn't identify a black person as a ""nigga"". It's a term black people use among themselves, it's not a term that they've chosen to be called by other races, unlike ""black"".

&gt; Anyway, it's my bedtime, and I feel like we understand each other's perspective, so if you don't mind I'll leave you to add anything that you want to and tie it up. Thanks for a polite and interesting discussion.

People get hope from the Doctor. Real people. Real hope. Fake Doctor. And, unfortunately, there are still people with a harder lot in life than cisgendered straight white males. So, yes. It would be good to have a female Doctor. Or any of the other suggestions. Because that would mean that the Doctor, Their Doctor, was accepting of them.

true,twcsata,null,null,"No.  The thing that the Time Lords escape from is not the same as the moment that the Doctors froze Gallifrey into.

I've said this in a few other threads on here, but to recap:  The time lock as presented in previous episodes is a lock on the entire Time War, not just Gallifrey, to seal it off from the rest of the universe.  It's a Time War; it exists in many points in time, is fought through time travel, and ruined vast swathes of the universe.  So, the time lock (however it was initiated--we really don't know yet) was to protect the universe from the ENTIRE WAR.  (This also explains why no one else in the entire run of new Who ever seems to remember the war, except the Doctor and the Master.)  By contrast, what we saw in ""The Day of the Doctor"" ONLY seals off Gallifrey, and ONLY from the last day of the war onward.  It doesn't affect anything else about the war.  The time lock still exists and is in effect--that's why the Moment (as Rose) had to let Ten, Eleven, and Clara in so they could join the War Doctor in the shed.  What changed was not the time lock, but the way the war ended WITHIN the time lock--instead of Gallifrey and the Daleks being burned up by the use of the Moment, Gallifrey gets sealed off in a pocket universe and the Daleks unwittingly blow each other out of the sky.  Now, I'm with uberfunkphd, below, when he mentions the line about the council's plans failing.  The group of Time Lords we see is the War Council (the first Doctor calls them that), not the High Council, and their leader does say that the High Council's plans have failed.  Probably that refers to Rassilon's group and their plans as seen in the End of Time; they would be aware that they are already in a time lock, and they would have a keen interest in getting out of it before the Doctor burns them up with the Moment.  They knew that he would try, because their oracle (prophet?  seer?  Can't remember the word they used) had seen it and told them.  So, The End of Time probably happened just very briefly before the Doctor steals the Moment from the Time Vaults.",0,1385331838,null,0,false,0,cdm4xxt,t3_1rdd91,t1_cdm4xxt,t3_1rdd91,null,1428523216,10,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,10

assuming the co-isn't gifted a huge sum of money at the outset to buy all the properties, it will have to borrow money.

In the first years of a mortgage you owe a lot, so most of the payments cover interest &amp; very little goes to paying down the debt. as the debt reduces, there's less interest costs &amp; more of the payments reduce the debt.

You don't need to say, ""genocide means the systematic murder of an entire race"" and then show them graphic pictures from the holocaust.  Parents are very capable of explaining difficult subjects to children, and children are far more capable of handling difficult subjects than you give them credit for.

There is absolutely no legitimacy to the claim that the entire premise of nuWho needed to be retconned because genocide was too hard for kids to understand or parents to explain.  It was retconned because Moffat decided it should be, despite ""The End of Days,"" despite ""The Night of the Doctor,"" and despite the story Doctor Who has told since 2005, because he believes it will yield a better story for the show moving forward.  Whether that choice yields fruits worth what it has invalidated, undermined, or changed remains to be determined.

In theory, no.  The loans will have the same terms as before, so you'll have to pay them back in the same way as before - you'll just be paying it to a different company and the Government will have an extra £500m in their pocket now.

I think that predicted what happened today very well. Without an actual LB spurs are forced to play their (arguably) best player out of position. Vert is smart and strong, but not pacey and he was always going to leak against Navas. Also, he is the only CB that could have challenged Augero.

true,za_warai_seirei,null,null,"So, I've been thinking about this really, and I have two slightly varying theories.

1) Tom Baker is both the 4th Doctor and the museum curator. We already know that he is no ordinary museum curator. This is because when the 11th is talking to himself whilst sitting on the bench after Clara goes back into the relatively present-day TARDIS, the 11th ponders being a museum curator and entertains the idea of taking up the aforementioned job after he retires. Then we hear Tom Baker say something along the lines of, ""You will,"" and we, of course, see Tom Baker. It is clear that he knows SOMETHING about the Doctor's future due to what he says. He could possibly be the 4th Doctor just because of the fact that the other versions of the Doctor forget the events that happened in the episode when they leave the museum at the end, so it's a possibility he could lose his memories of this as well. This theory, of course, does not give explanation for his ""old looks"", however.

2) Basically the above theory, except that Tom Baker may be the 13th Doctor and that he has learned to control his appearances when it comes to regenerating, and that he travels back in time to talk to his past self, etc.

I am very, very disappointed he didn't come. WITH him. He should have. It's a MASSIVE show, with MASSIVE history, and he's just rejecting it, rejecting the fans. It's maddening. Saddening!

That's a total cop-out, from a writing perspective. They should at least attempt some continuity. Most DW plots at least try to be continuous. 
&gt;you'll recall that Gallifrey was already time-locked in the version of the Doctor's past that we've seen

About that. . . How did the older Doctors manage to drop in during that last battle scene? Moment working her magic again? This doesn't actually feel like a big plot point, it just mildly bugs me.
&gt; This is how it already worked; it's just that the Doctor didn't realize that until now.

Except it isn't. They actually say during the scene with the big red button that they are in fact changing history, but they just won't remember it. 

As for that last bit, I understand what it is about this show that I like. And for most of the last 8 years, it's been well thought out, balanced writing, and a central character who feels three-dimensional. I feel like they flattened him out a bit last night and got a bit lazy with their writing.

My tip: you'll find lots of events have free food and alcohol around university. Keep an eye out for them. Also buy a second hand bike unless you have one. It's an investment that pays itself off in bus and taxi fare many times over.

true,Saiing,cnty-england,UK -&gt; Japan,"&gt; what makes women so different

The principal differences between male and female pelvis include:

* The female pelvis is larger and broader than the male pelvis which is taller, narrower, and more compact.
* The female inlet is larger and oval in shape, while the male sacral promontory projects further (i.e. the male inlet is more heart-shaped).
* The sides of the male pelvis converge from the inlet to the outlet, whereas the sides of the female pelvis are wider apart.
* The angle between the inferior pubic rami is acute (70 degrees) in men, but obtuse (90-100 degrees) in women. Accordingly, the angle is called subpubic angle in men and pubic arch in women. Additionally, the bones forming the angle/arch are more concave in females but straight in males.
* The distance between the ischia bones is small in males, making the outlet narrow, but large in females, who have a relatively large outlet. 
* The ischial spines and tuberosities are heavier and project farther into the pelvic cavity in males. The greater sciatic notch is wider in females.
* The iliac crests are higher and more pronounced in males, making the male false pelvis deeper and more narrow than in females.
* The male sacrum is long, narrow, more straight, and has a pronounced sacral promontory. The female sacrum is shorter, wider, more curved posteriorly, and has a less pronounced promontory.
* The acetabula are wider apart in females than in males.
* In males, the acetabulum faces more laterally, while it faces more anteriorly in females. Consequently, when men walk the leg can move forwards and backwards in a single plane. In women, the leg must swing forward and inward, from where the pivoting head of the femur moves the leg back in another plane. This change in the angle of the femoral head gives the female gait its characteristic (i.e. swinging of hips).

I'm not a doctor, but that last one sounds particularly relevant to this issue.

If I were to seriously pick directors for a Doctor Who movie or special, they'd be (in no particular order):

1) John Carpenter - He may not have it in him anymore (see The Ward) but if he was in his prime, imagine a Second Doctor-style seige story done in the style of Assault on Precinct 13. The man is a professed Quatermass fan, but I'm not sure how he feels about Doctor Who. That said, I admit I have difficulty picturing a kid-friendly picture from him, but there was Starman.

2) Steven Spielberg - I believe I read that he's a Doctor Who fan. Either way, imagine him directing a good ole ""theme park,"" adventure romp for The Doctor.

3) Gore Verbinski - For similar reasons as Spielberg. In his case, he made four movies literally based on a theme park ride and they were full of action, excitement, etc. He's dealt with Johnny Depp for all of them, so directing a character like The Doctor should be no different to him. He may not be the first name in talented directors, but I think he could handle Doctor Who and make it a good, fun movie.

4) Guillermo del Toro - I'd love for him to come up with a cool new monster, maybe played by Doug Jones? Imagine The Doctor meeting Ron Perlman. And the man knows how to produce movies that revel in their own realities.

Victoria Street, Chichester Street, May Street, Oxford Street, Ann Street, Seymour Street were closed to traffic after the incident began on Sunday night.

The area around the Victoria Square shopping centre has been sealed off.

Army bomb experts have been tasked to the scene. Diversions are in place.

""Police are continuing to deal with a security alert in Belfast City centre,"" a PSNI spokeswoman said. ""It is likely that this will continue for a number of hours"".

In a separate incident, Ravenhill Avenue has been closed in both directions at its junction with Roseberry Gardens and Roseberry Road after a suspicious object was found in the area.

Earlier, a suspect object found at Stockman's Lane was declared a hoax by police following a controlled explosion. It was the first of three security alerts to disrupt the city on Sunday.

There are no further details at this stage.

In places where they do case uproar which is the minority, the issue isn't the parade but the fact they don't know each other, community engagement generally works.

The vast majority of cases it is neither hateful or inciteful in its intention, people often see it as such but people can see anything of they pit their mind to it.
As I've mentioned County Armagh hosts the biggest twelfth in the country, it rotates around the 12 districts, there is no malice involved in organising the parade in Newtonhamilton (like it was this year, a district quite close to the border and incorporates lodges that meet in the Republic) its simply their turn, now the locals can shut up shop and deny them access, or use it to their advantage and make a clean fortune by letting them in and serving them. Next year it will be in Markethill, a majority protestant area, and the year after Bessbrook which is more mixed, the organisers of these parades live and work in these areas, they want their parade to go well and want their town or village to prosper, its no benefit to run about stirring up bother. It brings me much confusion and bemusement as why the largest twelfth is largely ignored by the media, because everyone is rather interested in fostering peace and prosperity but apparently don't want to see it.

Places like Twaddle/Ardoine are a mess, its an interface area with internal conflicts on at least just the nationalist (CARA Sinn Fein controlled, and GARC dissident controlled) side and probably internal conflict in the loyalist ends as well. There is no integration or wider community and they don't care for it, Sinn Fein are looking to gain political ground lost to the dissidents so are quite happy to push at the parade and stop it. I'm not saying there aren't legitimate gripes, but that this isn't going to solve any issues. 

SLIGHT WARNING I'M GETTING QUITE RANTY.

You then have dissidents causing a ruckus to gain attention and support, and so they ship in people from miles around, (last year someone from Spain was arrested, don't know what's going on there) and start shooting at the police with Kalashnikov style rifles.

Remember, newspaper writers want you to get worked up and link to their articles. Instead of doing that, it's always worth actually reading them and thinking 'hey, maybe this is reasonable, what is the article leaving out that would make this totally okay?'.

In this case, there seem to be a couple of reasonable problems. The first is that it's not clear that making really long strides is a remotely important standard to maintain, and so we should rightly question it if it's discriminatory. That's a different argument though, and not really the direct subject of this payout.

So what's actually going on? It's unclear, we don't get much information, but the article does say '""When I started getting pains in my groin I was told to march through it, '. Now this is quite different to 'not meeting the exacting standards' - it would probably be totally fine for the army to say 'sorry, you don't meet the standards, you're out. But they *didn't* do that, they failed to recognise an (apparently) legitimate medical problem, leading to injuries whose real magnitude is unclear to the reader. The last paragraph is interesting though, 'she had suffered four pelvic fractures.' sounds rather nastier than 'she wanted to make wimpy short strides'.

As part of this, we have to ask why the payout is £100000. It's easy to dismiss it to get to the meaty part of criticising those needy female servicemen, but what if we're optimistic instead of pessimistic...could it be that this sum is justified? That the women suffered needless injuries due to army negligence? That this sum reflects the ongoing effect on their lives and careers?

In the end, we don't know the details, but I'm always disappointed at how quickly people jump on the women for things that they didn't say and which don't seem to be a problem. The problem doesn't seem anything to do with lowering standards or avoiding the requirements of male colleagues, and I don't think it would be any problem if the army (legitimately) dismissed them on the basis of not meeting important requirements. Instead, it looks more like a case of negligence where the army didn't recognise a serious medical issue leading to needless injuries.

This is all speculation too, of course, but that's also part of the point.

There are still plenty of difficulties for the Doctor to face actually *finding* Gallifrey, and he may not even find it in the coming season, or something drastic might come up to change his priorities; and once he does find it, it's hardly going to be anything like the home he remembers because of how traumatized everyone will be. I think what it *will* do is instill a bit of much-needed hope in the Doctor and counteract his tendency to mope. (One of the reasons I loved the special is that it gave me some more David Tennant in his non-mopey mode; I would have liked for his periods of moping to take up less of his overall presence on the show, because he can do so much more than mope, however attractively he does it.) 

I personally think the Doctor's traumatized aspect was beginning to get a bit stale, like it had run its course, as grief always must. Now we'll be able to see the beginning of a healing of a sort, although it certainly won't be easy, not least because finding Gallifrey itself will be difficult. The difficulties the Doctor will face in reconciling his knew knowledge with the old, realizing that when he gets to Gallifrey it will be almost nothing like what he was imagining, since he's had centuries to idealize it in his memories and forget its flaws-- that will all provide a new source of character development that is not necessarily *replacing* the original trauma but *building* on it.

Really, the fact that you're frustrated probably shows that they did well in pulling the Doctor out of grief and giving him a new goal to strive for  *before* it got to the point where everyone was like ""ALL RIGHT ALREADY WE GET IT."" So, maybe that's a good thing?

I think Clara may be too preciously precocious sometimes (which I tend to temper in my own mind with the knowledge that a lot of that is the result of her brain being messed with in the first appearance of her modern incarnation), but as others have mentioned, it wasn't her *Clara*ness that made her intervene, it was her *Companion*ness. Any other of the Doctor's Companions would have done the same thing, I think-- and perhaps that's why the Box chose the most iconic Companion as an avatar, sort of pushing for the same thing without stating it outright. It's just that Clara happens to be the current Companion, so she's the one who intervened, providing the fresh viewpoint the Doctor needs. With three Doctors all conversing amongst themselves/himself (we need a new grammar for timey-wimeyness), it was like one of those subreddits that gradually devolves into a circlejerk because the absence of outside influences and dissenting opinions causes constant reinforcement of the same idea. That's why the Doctor needs a Companion, to keep him from circlejerking with himselves. If that makes any sort of sense at all. Once the idea is sparked, the Doctor(s) can take it from there, but it takes someone from outside the Doctor's own head(s) to start it all off. It really was the culmination of what Donna meant when she said he needed somebody with him. 

I probably could have made this post a lot more coherent, but my brain is a bit wibbley-wobbley itself right now, so this will have to do.

The BBC is stuck between a rock and a hard place: Young(ish) folk who want it to be groundbreaking and exciting and older people (realistically 50+) who want the BBC to be 'auntie' and provide the MOR stuff like The One Show. 

When you look at the output right now though, the BBC isn't doing badly at all: Dr. Who is sold internationally and Attenborough's output is BBC-only as far as I know. Several other shows are internationally syndicated and there's a commitment to producing new shows through BBC3, some of which are crap but wee gems liek Him &amp; Her come through.

That's not to mention Radio 4 productions like The News Quiz, the dramas and Desert Island Discs (the last of which, it appears, will be driving the political news cycle this week if nothing else of interest happens).

However, adding a continuation from the previous episode would only have served alienate the new audience, forcing the BBC to lose potential new audience.

It's a time war. There is no last day, they can just reverse it. That is what a time war is. Think of it like this. A soldier goes into battle, gets shot. He reverses it and shots the other guy. The other guy goes back and reverses it cause he got shot. Then picture all the guys and ohter guys doing that in that battle. Dam we lost that entire battle, we should go back in time and try a different battle, also with time travel you can change what choices you made. Then you can do crazy shit like transporting your entire force back an hour so you have more men. Hey why don't you just shoot their parents. Wait why not just go back in time to when they invented time travel, or ships or even guns, wait just go forward in time when you invented the space equivalent to an atom bomb. Hey you can fight along side your kid cause you can go their or he can come back. The thing about a war involving time travel is there is no end or start. Once that war happens it happens in an instant as well as forever as well as everywhere. Oh you want to take that territory. Just go back before they have defenses up. Well the other side can do that to, forever. Oh we lost the war, time to go back and try something else. But hey we were developing this crazy weapon while we lost guess we should take that with us and use it. That is what I though a time war is. No side can ever win, it just gets worse. 

Also I really dislike how the time lords were portrayed. During ten's run he said he had to stop them as well as the Daleks. He liked to think of them before the war because during it they were as bad as the daleks. Yet here they were portrayed as the good guys that were about to lose. Where were the horrors and terrors seen in the final days of the war, where were the Nightmare Child, the Skaro Degradations, the Horde of Travesties and the Could've Been King with his Army of Meanwhiles and Neverweres.

This article (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/houseprices/10179754/UK-rental-prices-hit-record-high-survey-shows.html) is dated July and says the UK average is £811, but London is £1270 which definitely pushes that average up. 

If I had to guess, I'd say £700 per month. Shared between two people that's not disastrous. Besides, 25-35% of salary on housing isn't too bad in my opinion since it should be by far the biggest expense.

Edit:  Moffat pretty much confirms what I said, it's just completely against his character to commit genocide:  http://www.buzzfeed.com/danmartin/steven-moffat-explains-this-big-the-day-of-the-doctor-twist",0,1385342112,null,0,1385344684,0,cdm92lx,t3_1rc0c3,t1_cdm92lx,t1_cdlyu0x,null,1428521091,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Do you seriously think that life hasn't improved since our parents generation?

The education you went through is WAY better, lasts longer and being poor doesn't stop you from going to University. And almost 50% of 18yr olds go to uni (didn't blair pledge 50% at one point?). I wonder what that percentage was when your parents were 18? I'm sure they didn't have the opportunities than our youngsters do to go to uni in the first place.

The NHS is far more comprehensive and covers you for way more than it covered your parents for. The benefit system is far more comprehensive too.

And I'd be willing to venture that current 18yr olds have way better lives in many ways than their parents did. Lives are easier thanks to technology at least. ",0,1385342138,null,0,false,0,cdm92yj,t3_1rd9ra,t1_cdm92yj,t1_cdm6kit,null,1428521088,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

Cherrypicking? 

&gt;  It shows that over the past four years black criminals have been less likely to receive police cautions and more likely to have been proceeded against in court, than any other ethnic groups.

That's over the whole past four years, it's not a few examples picked with a bias. 

It's not judges specifically saying ""I am going to judge black people more harshly"", the article itself says that is very unlikely to be the case. It's often due to deeply ingrained biases people have, such as believing that black people are violent or more aggressive etc. It's generally not people going out of their way to specifically target black people. 

I explained to you why young black men are thought to be over-represented. The statement that ""blacks are so drawn to crime in general"" is utter shit. 

Africa has nothing to do with this. There is still institutional racism in both the US and the UK, particularly in US with the fallout from the War on Drugs.

true,Mafiadons,,Lurgan,"This is not a ""TIL"" for me, I'm quite familiar with the set up as I've worked on the lough for years. It's a peculiar situation.
The bedding of Lough Neagh and what I think is 3 meters onto land around the lough shore is owned directly by the Estate mentioned. For every ton of sand removed from the Lough, the Estate gets a set fee and all the sand dredging companies pay it. It is not possible for the estate to own the water as its levels constantly change with rain and evaporation and the gates at the lower bann control the water level. I also believe the Co-Op of fisher-families operating on the Lough also pay a yearly fee to the Estate to operate. 
During the ""Discover Lough Erne"" push in the 90's 'Nick' offered to gift the lough to the public, but the government declined seeing it as 'costly' rather than as 'potential'. Since then the government have approached him and he's now asking for a monetary sum which the government are refusing to pay. Kinnego Marina and Oxford Island outside lurgan are on lough neagh and owned by Craigavon Borough Council where they actually bought the lough bed off the Estate to develop it as an attraction and this has proved quite successful.

You can't seriously play as though every rushed goalie clearance is going to fall nicely to one of your own men.  The very fact that we have players CONTINUOUSLY passing back to Lloris is part of the problem... nearly all keepers fuck one of those up eventually, and besides, its symptomatic of a complete lack of belief and creativity in the first place.

Lamela, Townsend, Paulinho and Holtby all have potential, but are really raw and are probably more suited to the lesser pressure of a mid-table side than a CL-chasing team right now.  Our three most reliable players this season have been Vertonghen, Lloris and Sandro, who were all here last season.

We can't keep saying, ""they'll come good soon, they'll come good soon"".  It's not a valid excuse.  The points we drop now are just as important as the points we drop at the end of the campaign.  If our current players can't do the job on the pitch, we need to change things up.  Bring back BAE, play Adebayor, do the things we used to do that got us points.

Our side needed time to bed in and play properly together, but the lack of progression is galling.

Parcel Farce are pretty terrible regarding import duty as they wack their own handling fees on top, which sometimes can be just as much as the import duty itself. The fees are pretty much a scam, and thankfully you can get away with not paying them.

If you head down to the depo, ask just to pay the import duty (which you're legally obliged to pay if you want the parcel). Ask them to send you an invoice for any of their fees, and I guarantee you they won't bother collecting after one letter.

We did this last year, but AVB seems unwilling to have us sit back now. It was cringeworthy to see Dawson pushing up and getting beat for pace time and time again. Can't really blame him though.

[The number of BTL landlords (as %age of population) has doubled in under 20 years, and their average age is 48.](http://opinion.publicfinance.co.uk/2013/07/buy-to-let-the-fiscal-dilemma/) 

Based on the average wealth figures given in that article, the average landlord owns less than 10 properties outright, 5 maybe (obviously some are BTL mortgage barons, too).

Many of these landlords have got into it because property is secure and (I'm sure) because it gives a better return than old-fashioned pensions. These guys are not getting any younger, but they've got decades in them, yet. 

At one time, in the 1970's, [one-third of the population lived in a council house]( http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0109dvs) - when Thatcher sold off our national assets she created a demographic of new little tories, and she massively tilted our national social narrative. 

During the decades in which we saw the NHS and unemployment benefit established, and council houses built for everyone, attitudes were very different from today. Having fought two world wars in less than three decades, there was a determination to build a better world for everybody.

Not only the national narrative, but the whole global narrative, back then, was much more socialistic - everyone should be entitled to a job, and workers should get a fair day's pay. We should look after our pensioners and the disabled. 

There simply is not the pressure, just yet, to make a difference. There's a lot of hot air and whinging on here, but there is very little questioning of the real status quo - the proportion of people on here who think that the means of production should belong to the workers (or anything like that) is vanishingly small.

Back in the 50's, half the world was dominated by socialism. For three decades wealth inequality fell, and so did social mobility. For the last three decades, those metrics have risen - a school-leaver today has *measurably* and *provably* less chance of success than his or her parents did.

Even if Labour got in next election, they're not going to do anything radical, that will destabilise property prices. There is not currently enough pressure for emergency plans, and any proposals right now are of the kinds that take further decades to come to fruition.

I think that another decade or two of rising inequality might be enough to change the public's sympathies, but I think things are going to get worse before they get better. If you have money to buy a BTL property then I think it's pretty safe right now, but if you have the opportunity to work abroad for the next decade, then I would take it.",0,1385348621,null,0,false,0,cdmbwap,t3_1rd9ra,t1_cdmbwap,t3_1rd9ra,null,1428519775,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

&gt; different function to the usual one

The sonic screwdriver has a ""usual"" function? I don't think that's been the case since Patrick Troughton was the Doctor.

&gt; need to know the resonance frequency - and I assume ""down to the subatomic level"" was due to it being wood, not a particularly good conductor of sound

&gt; [snippy snip]

&gt; The reason none of these are wooden doors is probably (I hazard a guess) because wood, as a material is pretty good at damping vibrations... so achieve it, you'd need to find its precise resonance frequency... perhaps even down to the subatomic level...?

I appreciate the education tips, thank you. But it's cool. I was a student musician and studied some physics in general engineering. I know what harmonic resonance can do.

However, as you get an idea of when you read through something like a [Bass Instrument forum thread discussing resonant frequencies of woods made to make musical instruments](http://www.talkbass.com/forum/f57/different-woods-their-natural-resonances-204541/)... or pages that discuss [materials used to build and cope with seismic problems](http://www.exploratorium.edu/faultline/damage/building.html), you realise a few things:

a) wood is used rather than glass, concrete and other rigid materials *precisely because it's more flexible* and capable of coping with such resonances.

b) The Doctors needn't have done any ""calculations"". They could have done **measurements** instead - start a frequency sweep from 0 to whatever Hz with one screwdriver at one end; use another screwdriver to measure the resonance in the centre. Then apply all three screwdrivers, in phase, over-stress it.

See? 1) Much better ""science"", 2) still needing the dramatic elements of all three Doctors and their screwdrivers and 3) doesn't actually **violate and contradict** things Moffat's written previously (*ooh, more on that in a minute, if I may!*).

And incidentally, that's why I ***hate, with a burning fiery passion***, the sh\*tty science-fiction writers of today. They can't ask a graduate student to spend two hours reading a script and picking out the **bullshit**, for a ***millionth*** of the rest of the production cost.

c) And none of this science **still** really matters in the end, because we were *flatly told* that the screwdrivers ***do not work on organic material***. Bugger me, ask a fan grad student to go over the script, wouldn't they do it for **free**?

And again incidentally, **that's** why I hate, ***with a nuclear, searing, lethal passion***, asshole writers like Steven Moffat who *can't even either*:

1) stick to the damn rules of their own damn show, or

2) one line.

Want another example of why I've learned to hate Steven Moffat with a passion?

Those Doctors' calculation trick with the screwdrivers, right? ""Same software, same screwdriver, different case"", right? That's why it worked, right?

**Wrong**. Go back and check Matt Smith's first full episode, *The Eleventh Hour*, **as written by Steven Moffat**. 37 minutes in, while trying to attract the Jailer's attention, he overloads and burns out the Tenth Doctor's screwdriver. 38m50s in after a scene cut, they're still standing around the same place, talking about how to flush out Prisoner Zero. And then he runs off to get Amy's friend's laptop.

... *screwdriver left behind as a literally-smoking, literally-twisted, literally-melted stick on the ground*.

59m45s in, the TARDIS pops up a new one from its console. He picks it up, tests it and says ""A new one! Lovely!"".

... ""same screwdriver"" *my ass*.

And **that**, if I may beg your pardon and patience, is why Steven Moffat is hurting *Doctor Who*. With fan service over good writing, he's cashing in all the cheques *Doctor Who* ever accumulated. I *swear*, there was better writing when the TV series was cancelled and all we had were the novels.",0,1385350078,null,0,false,0,cdmciwk,t3_1rbobc,t1_cdmciwk,t1_cdm14ko,null,1428519481,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

A lot of people myself included probably got annoyed with how everyone was acting like every signing Spurs made was amazing. All I would see was people saying how it was the greatest transfer window ever and how Levy pulled one over on whatever club the player was signed from. Also a lot of Spurs fans were acting like they were legit title contenders even though they weren't even close to the title the previous season rubbed people the wrong way too.

true,Theopholus,null,null,"Questions:

How does Smith and Clara get out of The Doctor's time stream? This just ignored it ever happened... Which might have got messy really, but some mention of the end of season 7 would have been good. 

Tennant said, before going back into his TARDIS that he also wouldn't remember, and then asked a question resulting in Trensalore. Are we to take that he actually did remember? The apparent time frame of this episode was right before ""The End of Time"" and Ten's regeneration into Eleven. 

During ""The End of Time"" it's pretty apparent that Tennant felt the Time Lords were evil. He says he chooses to remember them in the good ways. There was no mention of them just being under bad leadership, as some people have said. Rassilon still will want to initiate the ""Final Sanction"" and ascend. 

The Doctor also implies that it wasn't just the Time Lords in the lock:

""You weren't there, in the final days of the War. You never saw what was born. But if the Time Lock's broken, then everything's coming through! Not just the Daleks, but the Skaro Degradations, the Horde of Travesties, the Nightmare Child, the Could-Have-Been-King with his army of Meanwhiles and Never-weres; the War turned into Hell! And that's what you've opened right above the Earth! Hell is descending!""

Also, in The Night of the Doctor, the gal on the spaceship said of the Time Lords and Daleks that ""Who could tell the difference anymore?"" 

So, did the nature of the time lock change? Because in this episode, the options were to just lock away the Time Lords for later, or to destroy them, the Daleks, and who knows who else. They said The Moment would destroy the galaxy in the episode. Are the Time Lords in the same galaxy as humans? I would assume not at this point. 

So if the Time Lock always happened, then the option to use The Moment was never used. Did this become a [predestination paradox](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSB3bRTYnLw)? Or, has it always been? But this is pretty well the cause of most of my questions. 

I guess the easy answer is that we can assume that Tennant's Doctor retained some information from his meeting with Eleven and The War Doctor, and that, I guess, there was always some form of time lock, but the lock changed... But this will never be addressed. And now, the Daleks were not locked away, meaning they've been roaming the galaxy doing their Dalek business, and are pretty well back to their old selves, instead of being remnants and fragments... This has been seen pretty recently, such as in The Asylum episode, which admittedly didn't make much sense since all the Daleks we've seen had been fringe groups till then. But what happens when The Doctor releases the Time Lock? Are the Time Lords going to go back to war with the universe at large? how will the interstellar community handle their sudden reemergence? My guess is that for the sake of keeping the show moving forward, we'll never really have answers. It's a big tangled ball of logic, in a show that doesn't dwell on logic. It's something I equally love about, and am frustrated by, in Doctor Who. 

There's always the possibility that Moffat could always make the Time Lock they just created into a ""First time lock"" and when The Doctor releases the Time Lords, they slowly start being evil again and he ends up having to go through it all again... Maybe that's even what Trensalore is about. 

Or maybe, this whole thing happened inside Eleven's timestream, with him and Clara emerging out on Trensalore... Maybe even in the future, with Capaldi fighting his last battle. 

I can see why people don't even want to give the show a chance. This crap is complex!",0,1385351726,null,0,false,0,cdmd9ax,t3_1rc0c3,t1_cdmd9ax,t3_1rc0c3,null,1428519139,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

John Hurt says, ""Bad Wolf Girl,"" and both 10 and 11 appear surprised. But maybe after they're initial surprise, they start to remember. Kind of like, ""Wait, what, did he just say Bad Wolf??? Oh wait... back when I was him... wasn't there someone there? Oh snap, that was Rose... no wait, that was the Moment taking the form of someone from my future- Rose. OH!

Rose/Bad Wolf: Keep in mind Rose and Bad Wolf are two different characters. Rose is the blond girl that gets picked up in 2005 by Eccleston. Bad Wolf is the super-god that Rose becomes when she looks into the heart of the TARDIS. Why the moment chose Bad Wolf is up for debate, but I believe it pretty much comes down to Billie Piper agreed to come on the show. The Moment could've literally chosen anyone.

As for regenerations, there can be 13, making Capaldi the last, not Smith. However, there's some debate on that counting, and it almost surely will get taken care of before Capaldi regenerates.  As for why there were only 13 at the battle, well... I like the theory that's developed in this subreddit in various places, I think. All the previous doctors up to Smith had no idea what happened to Gallifrey, and showed up because they thought they were time locking it. Only Smith, thanks to the Curator, knows that it is still out there. He decides to go looking for it, but gets stuck on Trenzalore this Christmas, regenerates into Capaldi. Capaldi says ""ok, so now that I'm this Doctor, lemme get back to my quest of finding Gallifrey, but first, I'll just pop over and help lock it."" He does that, then eventually DOES find Gallifrey. The Timelords show their gratitude by granting him more regenerations, or possibly removing the limit entirely, and from then on, all the other regenerations after Capaldi know it's safe, and they don't NEED to go back to the moment where it's locked.

But I'd say AVB is definitely stubborn because every game this season has seen us start with three things: a 4-2-3-1 formation, inverted wingers, and a high back line.

Arguably only the latter has worked for us, and only in a handful of games against teams not strong in fast counter-attacking.  Against Arsenal, Chelsea, Newcastle, Man City and West Ham, it's failed us.

Teams with strong, fast players with direct movement breaking from midfield have shown us up time and time again.  There's no way we should ever have gone to the Etihad and played with a high back line.  It was suicide.

There is no ""The Moment.""  

All we saw is a moment of decision setup, conducted and played out at the hands of Bad Wolf in order to give a final bit of healing closure to her Doctor(9), her love (10) and remind Doctor 11 that he's still got a lot of work fixing things to do.  Everything was a dog-and-pony show for the manipulation and benefit of the Doctor.


--The Time Lords have a sentient weapon, the most powerful weapon in the universe, with a conscience backing it up.  Literally, it's a godlike being which operates outside the control of the Time Lords and with a will largely of its own.

-- During the Time War, the Time Lords have always had this weapon (and it was possibly created by the 8th Doctor sometime therein.)  The abilities of this weapon are based of the Key Of Rassilon and a De-Mat Gun allowing for a mass rewrite of any event (see: Bad Wolf's destruction of the Dalek fleet; Jack's resurrection)

-- Bad Wolf is massively powerful, sentient and liberally splices itself into Time to achieve its ends, many of which support the idea of the Doctor being heroic, generally using him as a tool to better the Universe by making him select a different path than the otherwise destructive one he seems forced to choose. (""The Parting of the Ways"")

----The Doctor (Hurt) is seen entering a place of decisions carrying a puzzle box.  We never *see* the Doctor steal the Moment, nor do we ever see it in the possession of the Time Lords.  We see them miss it, then he has it.  *It* was never there to begin with, a mimetic plant by Bad Wolf to put itself in the Doctor's hands and get him moving along Bad Wolf's designs to solve a problem.  His war-shattered self accepts her manifestation because of the Box while the other two would have either questioned it (ala River in the Library) or refused to interact with it (2nd Clara in Victorian England).

--As foreshadowing, what a temptation:  A Puzzlebox that can, when figured out, solve the Time War, an event that was plaguing the mind of the 8th Doctor.  He figures out the solution, stops the War and in so doing, proves to all Gallifrey that he (all of him) is better than the madman they think he is by literally thinking (and acting) outside the box.

--The trappings of the box change as the solution makes itself more understood, first a puzzle, then a big, red, rose-like button.  The Moment is not a device, but a concept.  In this effect, it is an backwards echo created by Bad Wolf to foreshadow and remind the Doctors of Rose/Bad Wolf and drive home the fact that there is another way.  Add in the Clara is there, a girl who is ALWAYS there to help save his life and you've got the best ""suggestion via heavy hammer"" ever.

So then, there never was a ""The Moment"" any more than any decision made by the Doctor is A Moment that can effect massive (potentially destructive) change upon the lives of billions.  Bad Wolf just shepherded him in a direction that WASN'T genocidal because he deserves better than that and *because she wanted to.*

I find this unlikely.  There are so many more of us nerdy types, I think we can keep them making the show.  That said, I see two ways for the writers to get around the limitation from the rule of 12 regenerations:

WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW (obviously)

1: Melody gives up her own regenerations to save the Doctor after poisoning him in Let's Kill Hitler.  It is perfectly reasonable that less than all of it would have been required, given that she had only regenerated (I think) twice.  That gives plenty of spare regeneration to play with.

2: The Time Lords, if I have heard correctly, are able to reward individuals by adding regenerations.  I think they did this for the Master in the Time War, as he was a highly.... effective... asset.  They also discussed something similar with the Valeyard, but that gets weird fast.

The End of Time, the Timelords used the Master to create a tether. The problem was they wanted to end time and also anything else in the timelock could escape and basically the Timewar erupts out all over again. 

He knew the white Dwarf Star was the result of timelord science, so he was not surprised to see timelords pop out. But he knew they were from before he used the Moment. He knew the star was used as the physical tether. So he destroyed it to send them back.

What they did in this latest episode is put the planet into stasis in another universe outside the time war. So all the bad is still stuck in the lock and can't get out but the planet is safe(in a manner of speaking) and trapped in a single moment of time for the last 400+ years.

Both of these concepts are actually introduced before the final two-parter. The first principle is demonstrated during the first part of the two-parter, used again to solve the collapsing universe problem, and only after that is it used to save the Doctor.

Contrast season 6: The key concept to avoid the fixed point of the Doctor's death is that if you hide inside a robot duplicate of yourself, somehow the fixed point of your death is no longer the fixed point of your death but is instead just the fixed point of your robot duplicate getting shot. The idea is literally introduced *nowhere* prior to the Doctor revealing that it was the magical solution to his problem.

Contrast season 7: The last fifteen minutes of this episode is literally just one deus ex machina after another.

But I've got so much upvote karma to burn, *I really don't care anymore*. Besides, there **really are burningly strong answers**.

So I'm **happy** to answer your question (and *thank you* for asking!).

I'll answer it in two ways: 1) I'll explain *some* of what I couldn't-help-but-hate about the Anniversary and 2) some of the *incredibly awesome super-special stuff* that *Doctor Who* has done previously, but Russell Davies *deliberately* **undid** and ignored.

(Did you know that before the Tenth Doctor met Sarah Jane, the ***Eighth*** Doctor was supposed to have met her? Did you know that the Tenth Doctor episode *Human Nature* where he became a human was originally a ***Seventh*** Doctor novel?)

1)...

The writing was - possibly - the worst, sloppiest writing I have **ever** seen in *Doctor Who*. I have (I'm sure you won't be surprised to hear) a list of massive, screaming, jarring flaws that drained over half-of-the-fun from the episode (will post it here as proof if you like. Not to mention, if the Reddit collective can justify / explain those holes, that WOULD be awesome!).

But, as a more accessible set of examples, may I point you to the following sub-threads?

So. 2)...

If you **would** like to see really special writing and ideas ***way*** more fantastical than saving a planet into a pocket universe...? Head over to the [*Doctor Who Reference Guide*](http://www.drwhoguide.com/who.htm#7TH).

Some of the stuff written between series was really poor. And some of it was **mind-blowing**. See if you can find the free e-book the BBC release of the final 7th Doctor story ""Lungbarrow"", *where we see his childhood home* and the **Gallifreyan sterility curse which led them to develop regeneration be lifted with the help of his previous jungle savage companion**. And why Time Lords were *never born as babies*, but *fully-grown body adults*. 15 years ago, I paid $140 for 2 paper copies of that out-of-print book from overseas (sold out so fast, never reached my country); one for me, one as a gift for a friend.

And that? Man, that's nothing. Catch the introduction of Doctor's enemies - more infectious than Weeping Angels, more elusive than the Silence... when the Eighth Doctor discovered the vultures hanging on the side of the original Time War which didn't involve anything as *pussy* as the Daleks, but an Enemy which was quite literally a ***History***... and the opportunistic vultures *alone* managed to invade Gallifrey... [Faction Paradox](http://www.drwhoguide.com/paradox.htm) - the ex-Time Lords who recruited *humans* as agents...

In the last few decades, housing has gone from being a functional thing that people use primarily as a home to being an asset that people use primarily as an investment.  Its value therefore isn't in its use to the owner as a home, but in its potential for exchange on the housing market.

This has led to houses effectively being used as bullion.  Those able to afford them want more of them because they're seen as a safe bet (particularly in London and the South East, where prices increased even throughout the crash), as evidenced by the increased buying up of property by foreign investment funds.  Those unable to afford them have to rent from the former.

Essentially, they're not homes any more - they're a means of storing wealth for those who already have it.

The only way I can see it ever getting better is through another crash, such as if many, many people were unable to pay their rents at once.

Not that Billie didn't do a great job, or that it didn't fit.

&gt; 
&gt; ""Clare's Law provides people with the information they need to escape an abusive situation before it ends in tragedy,"" she said.

Plus, this gets even harder to reconcile with Ten's own actions and reactions during the climax of End of Time.  He was surprised the Gallifreyans had broken out of the timelock, not that they *existed*.  Which is what he should have thought, if he was living thinking that Gallifrey had been outright destroyed.

I'm almost forced to conclude that the events of TDOTD happened in a meta-verse that then resulted in the creation of the timeline shown during RTDs reign.  Which would also mean RTD's Ten is something like the third Ten to pass through that particular sequence of events, which is timey-wimey beyond belief.

A Time Lord usuallt is limited to 12 regenerations, thus allowing 13 incarnations. However we already know of many cases where this number has been messed with, both increasing and decreasing it. This limit seems to be of artificial nature anyways though.

As for your question, no a Time Lord cannot ""jump back"" to previous incarnations. However in some cases Time Lords have been shown to be able to influence the outcome, in most cases it is a lottery though. The only time the Doctor ever influenced the outcome was when the 8th Doctor became the War Doctor.

However since the Curator implied he is a future incarnation of the Doctor and looks just like the 4th, and even mentions how he is ""visiting old favorites"" he may take control of a future regeneration somehow to look just like the 4th.

tl;dr - anyone can request a check on any individual in a relationship with them or someone they know, but the police decide what to do with the outcome of the checks. They're not going to send you a rap sheet.

&gt;The aim of this scheme is to give members of the public a formal
mechanism to make enquires about an individual who they are in a
relationship with or who is in a relationship with someone they
know, and there is a concern that the individual may be abusive
towards their partner.

&gt;If police checks show that the individual has a record of abusive
offences, or there is other information to indicate the person you
know is at risk, the police will consider sharing this information with
the person(s) best placed to protect the potential victim.

&gt;Your local police force will discuss your concerns with you
and decide whether it is appropriate for you to be given more
information to help protect the person who is in the relationship
with the individual you are concerned about.

&gt;The scheme aims to enable potential victims to make an informed
choice on whether to continue the relationship, and provides help
and support to assist the potential victim when making that
informed choice.",0,1385370576,null,0,false,0,cdmhz8d,t3_1relve,t1_cdmhz8d,t3_1relve,null,1428516905,32,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,32

Get a HC1/2 form. It will entitle you to free everything on the NHS, including dental works, glasses and prescriptions. If you're even the slightest bit ill, USE IT while you have it. It needs renewing yearly.

Travelcard is well worth the investment if you're under 25. So is an NUS card. 

Tesco, ASDA and Morrisons' gong out of date isle is perfect to pick up meat. Just freeze it. Better yet, make freinds with a person who works there; employees get ridiculous discounts (at least my housemate did).

Learn to like baked beans. They are such a cheap source of some very vital nutrients and invest in a multivitamin + iron. 

If you're a girl, get an implant on the NHS. It's free, you never have to worry about contraception and there's a good chance it'll stop your period and you won't have to pay out for tampons and pads for three whole years. Obviously, if you're having casual sex with random people, condom is still needed.

The friend with the car is priceless, but always offer them something in return for their favours. Clean their room, make a tea, check their essay etc.

You can proofread for money, especially if you live in halls. My rate was £5 for an essay, £10-15 for a dissertation. 

Peopleperhour is a good way of making cash. 

Dominos pizza is a good place to get a part-time job. My boss outright told me that takeaways tended to hire one or two people whose English is fluent for the front-line customer service for obvious reasons. As bad as it sound, you may be more likely to get a job at these places for your nationality alone. 

Do not turn on the heating ever. Wear layers and invest in thermal socks, a thick dressing gown and horrible slipper-boots. 

On the same vein, get in the habit of turning off lights whenever you exit a room, even if you're coming back in a second.

When you get into second and third year, try to stay in halls. It is cheaper and all your bills are sorted, including heating etc, so you'll be comfortable. All you have to worry about is food. 

Drinking. I cannot stress enough how overrated drinking is at uni. It's expensive and literally has no purpose other than to make you miss your 9am lecture and feel like crap. Don't get tricked by social convention. If somebody buys you a drink, great. But don't force yourseld to return the favour. Kindly explain that you can't return the gesture, and most normal people understand.

Use the ""I hate being poor"" anguish to motivate you to do better. Otherwise you'll be living like crap for nothing. ",0,1385371303,null,0,false,0,cdmi3b5,t3_1rd3b6,t1_cdmi3b5,t3_1rd3b6,null,1428516852,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Coutinho should have been playing down the middle if Suarez was up on his own. 

Joe Allen. Not sure this was the right game to bring him back in. He did ok, but the chance he missed was a schoolboy miss. The goal was gaping and he had Suarez square. Unforgivable miss, its hard to say but that might have put the game to bed too.

Right - resting Sturridge, playing Flano. Mignolet was immense. He almost saved Lukaku's first too, he got his hand to it and I reckon he'll have been annoyed he didn't save - which he had no right to really. Top keeper and although we conceded three, he kept us in it. Bringing on Sturridge when he did. Its refreshing to see us trying to be ruthless and going for the win. Studge came on when it 2-2.

The problem with payday loans is that the sort of people that take them out are generally the sort of people that have financial problems *because* of their own financial behaviours and when their payday loan goes wrong (they can't afford to repay) they don't act like a responsible person, they bury their head in the sand. If you have a payday loan with a reputable company (say Wonga) and can't afford to repay, contact them and they'll freeze the interest (once you've missed the repayment) and set up a payment plan.

The reason people get into situations where they end up paying thousands on a £200 loan is because they're financially irresponsible. Whether that's their fault or the fault of the lack of financial education in this country, who knows, but payday loans *used responsibly* don't cost that much. I think if they want to really address the problem we need better financial education *and* perhaps require payday lenders to do the leg work on setting up repayment plans so even if someone buries their head in the sand they don't get screwed long term.

Johnson gave the ball away a lot, as did Gerrard. Johnson's big game temperament is a worry, he tends to lose his composure and get rid of the ball quickly. The way Gerrard struggled around the pitch for the first 70 minutes it looked like he was conserving energy. He looked way off the pace and he's that bad he should have been on the bench as an impact sub. He wasn't played out of position, he just played badly.

Most of their best chances came from mistakes by those three.

Good: Suarez is a remarkable player. I feel like some of our other players need to watch Suarez videos and they'd improve 50%. He never stops to admire his pass or wait for his team mates to do something.

Mignolet is a great reflex keeper. Most keepers try to stop close range shots by chucking themselves at the ball, he's quick enough to make genuine saves at close range.

More controversial, but I thought Joe Allen had a pretty good game. Missing an easy shot doesn't make you a bad player and in terms of general play he was much better than Gerrard.

If a person is prone to violence because of alcohol but is an ex addict, then if they relapse ( which they could do at any time )  that behaviour could and probably will become exponentially worse. Firstly out of sheer frustration from the addict that they've lost control again and then because the addict will revert straight back to the way they were before they hit rock bottom and pulled themselves out of denial and out of their  addiction.  

I say this as an ex- dependant alcoholic ( not a violent one though, I personally caused more harm to myself than anyone else ) but if I was entering into a new relationship, it'd be one of the first things I'd discuss to get it out of the way. 

If however an ex addict chose to keep their past secret then I'd be pretty wary of them anyway because deception is a major part of addiction and someone who's worked through that would definitely come clean about their past. You have to, it's part of the recovery process.

Having spoken to my contacts in Mumbai and Delhi, they also agree that it is the most probable reason. Having worked in India as a journalist, I can assure you that the local authorities are inherently corrupt, and run in accordance to what they see fit. 

This is particularly apparent in this case as they have not released any further information about the detainment of the men for nearly 4 weeks. 

So, when you say mercenary, I presume you assume that they are gallivanting about the ocean firing at what they see fit while being paid to do so by a 'shady' company?  

You seem to be more well informed about this than I am - an international journalist specialising in conflict and international diplomacy, so maybe you can help me out.  

Can you provide me your sources which outline that this company is 'shady' and that the job definition of maritime security is to be classed as 'mercenary' work?

Because I would really appreciate that for my follow-up article on the situation. 

Can I also ask, because you seem so well informed, do you have any knowledge of the dangers of running cargo vessels and oil tankers in the Indian Ocean these days due to piracy?

Did you know that Somali piracy costs the shipping industry more than $8.3 bn a year, which also puts the lives of merchant seamen, fishermen, and cruise line operators at risk?

The two outcomes of using the services is you either find out your partner has a history of abusive behavior, or they don't.

If they do, you either get out, or you fear for what they would do if *they* found out. If you're tolerant of the first time and you buy the excuses, I don't see how knowing if they have a violent past or not would help a huge number of cases because 'they've changed' or 'they promised they won't do it again'.

If they don't have a violent past, then that further reinforces the idea that 'it's once off, so it'll be fine' and you end up in an abusive relationship.

true,neonmantis,null,Derby International,"When the coalition were pushing through some of the cuts which would severely affect the prospects of blind and visually impaired people I arranged to take a group of service users of the charity I worked for from Bolsover (His constituency)  to meet him at his office in Parliament. This was all arranged in writing and we had an appointment. 

All of these people were elderly, had quite severe sight loss and a couple had never even been to London before. It took us nearly five hours to get there and then battle our way to Parliament and then his office. We got there a little late, only 10 minutes or so, because of london traffic and the general speed that visually impaired people travel around at. 

We eventually meet him and he is clearly distracted, answering the phone in the middle of conversations, being interrupted by staff etc. We had barely managed to introduce the people in the group before he told us he needed to cut the meeting short because of other unspecified arrangements. We got about another minute with him where he largely asked silly questions about being blind rather than listening to their legitimate concerns about how they were going to survive the legislative changes before we were ushered out. 

I immediately asked if we might be able to discuss the issue properly in his constituency office in Bolsover (we'd originally asked for this but he made it very difficult) but he insisted these people, who can't get around unaided, had to come back to London again. He was rude, condescending, patronising, more interested in himself and how he would cope if he lost his sight and was just generally a bit of a prick. 

This was all underlined by the next PMQ's where he stood up and spoke about how he had been meeting with his blind constituents to listen to their concerns and take up the fight in parliament. He spent more time showcasing the meeting in PMQ's then he spent with us. 

Now, he could have been very busy and yes we were a bit late, but his attitude from start to finish was really disappointing. Some of our service users were in tears before they even left his room.

2. Dembele's been awful this season, but Paulinho is clearly knackered and is going equally off-form. I'd play Sandro with either Capoue or Holtby just now.
3. Chiriches is young and that would be a big ask, although given we don't have a left-back at the moment, it might have been better to go with him anyway.
4. I would have played Townsend on the left over Lennon, who's done the square root of bugger all this season. Starting on the left would give Townsend less incentive to waste attacks with hopeless shots.
5. This I agree with, although he did try 4-4-2 briefly in this game.

If anything, it's great that he is sticking to his own moral compass and didn't just ignore the things he didn't like to see so he could soak up free popularity and tons of money or ignore scripts he didn't like for the same reasons. He didn't just sell out. Does it suck because he wasn't really in this episode and was only in stock footage and a CGI'd John Hurt face? Sure, this episode would have been much better with him actually doing something new in the 13 doctor scene and his actual face, and it would have been even better if he got to hang out with Smith and Tennant (as unlikely as that would have been, I don't think that was ever in the cards).

It's this attitude the letter was aiming to address. Children should be encouraged to learn about the world around them so that they can make their own decisions and form their own ideas and opinions, not forced into a culturally blind minority by over-controlling parents.

That said, the letter sounds to me like it is a part of a longer dialogue. I can sense the frustration in the otherwise ridiculous threat but that poor judgement has put the head in a counter-productive position. Children who cannot attend should be grouped for a second attempt.

I was brought up a Catholic, but made the fatal error of studying my religion and quickly became atheist. I also studied Islam in school 15 years ago, long before this became a ""problem"" and thoroughly enjoyed learning about another culture with similar rules and background but alternative viewpoints on often minor differences. All religions I've given time to learn about are fascinating.

But more importantly, hate comes through ignorance, ignorance comes from lack of understanding, and that comes from denying your child the right to learn.

true,devilliers178,lfc68,,"Wrong

- Playing Coutinho on the left. It was more exposed than usual because Enrique goes forward enough for Couts to move inside more, but Flannagan was the one moving inwards rather than Phillipe. 

- I would have brought Alberto on for Moses, composure on the ball was needed and Moses cannot offer that. 

- I would have played Sakho, even if it meant 3 at the back. We have seen enough in the past of Agger Skrtel 
having a hard time against targetmen. Sakho would have been able to deal with it and was on a high from the weeks win for France. But i can see why BR went 4 at the back. 


Right

- Gonna sound weird but playing Allen was the correct choice, i thought he grew into the game and was quite good in the tight spaces going forward. There seems to be an idea on this sub that Allen is a defensive minded midfielder which he just isnt. If he had scored that chance we would be talking about him very differently. Its a bad miss, but he got himself in the position to make the shot and read that passage of play really well. 

- Flannagan

- Sturridge impact sub

- Not using Toure as a left back. 

- Not playing a 4-3-3

Edit: ""Allen is a defensive minded midfielder which he just isnt."" I feel this just because his kit is much better suited to going forward and holding up the ball than moving the ball from defence to attack. He is a good passer but i think gets to technical and dosnt look for the simple ball. What made players like Alonso and Gerrard on his day great is that incisive, instant decision making, no nonsense ball and i havn't seen it from Allen yet. Nor is he the Mascherano/Lucas mould of midfielder.  ",0,1385376986,null,0,1385414515,0,cdmivqm,t3_1renpv,t1_cdmivqm,t3_1renpv,null,1428516484,11,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11

Johnston had the worst game I can remember. Where did all these Ronaldinho flicks come from? Over and over he gave the ball away needlessly and then was caught too far forward.

Next, why oh why aren't we getting any better at defending set pieces.  I can barely watch the comedy defending in the box.

true,Mordisquitos,lancashire,Manchester,"&gt; Now, can you kindly explain where I have made a ""superficially similar yet unequivalent proposition""?

I can. The segregation of men and women in changing rooms or bathrooms is only superficially similar to that of segretation during a debate at the request of the speaker. This superficial similarity is that it involves the separation of the sexes.

Both situations are fundamentally unequivalent because of the following points:

+ The **context** in which the segregation takes place: one deals with the practicalities of bodily functions and hygiene, the other involves public and open debate in institutions that are considered one of the mainstays of equality, freedom of speech, and intellectual pursuit.
+ The people **in whose interest** the segregation is carried out: in one case the segregation is carried out (in theory) for the benefit of the individuals being segregated, in the other it is carried out at the behest of an individual towards those being segregated.
+ Recognition of the legitimacy of **non-segregated alternatives**. If a venue wished to provide three kinds of bathrooms or changing rooms as in ""Men"", ""Women"" and ""Unisex"", we do not allow those who prefer using a segregated bathroom to impede this, or to stop people from using the unisex facilities. If someone is deeply offended by the presence of unisex changing rooms they can go elsewhereHowever, Univesities UK is explicitly recommending universities to allow a pro-segregation speaker to veto the creation of non-segregated seating spaces: _""In practice, a balance of interests is most likely to be achieved if it is possible to offer attendees both segregated and non-segregated seating areas, although if the speaker is unwilling to accept this, the institution will need to consider the speaker’s reasons under equalities legislation [...] Ultimately, if imposing an unsegregated seating area in addition to the segregated areas contravenes the genuinely held religious beliefs of the group hosting the event, or those of the speaker, the institution should be mindful to ensure that the freedom of speech of the religious group or speaker is not curtailed unlawfully""_",0,1385378147,null,0,1385378560,0,cdmj15h,t3_1rdnjk,t1_cdmj15h,t1_cdmib39,null,1428516413,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Oo interesting.

&gt;From Day of the Doctor we know that The Doctor beats the regeneration limit, evidenced by an aged Tom Baker appearing. He hints at him 'revisiting some old faces'. This is implying that The Doctor can choose who to become.

Not if the War Doctor doesn't count because of the elixir and the Curator is actually the last and used a plural because he was visiting his own relics in the museum. I don't think that's likely, though, because the BBC presumably wants to keep the show going.

&gt;So what if as he sits in his trusty old TARDIS, wounded and ready to go he gets asked who he wants to become? So he chooses to take the face of a noble old Roman he met once before.

In terms of aggression, specifically between partners / domestic relationships:

Via [Scientific American](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=are-men-the-more-belligerent-sex)

&gt;Girls do not have an exclusive claim to relational aggression, however. A 2008 meta-analysis by psychologist Noel Card of the University of Arizona and his colleagues suggests that it is equally common in girls and boys across both childhood and adolescence. Other research suggests this absence of sex differences persists into adulthood.

&gt;More surprisingly, women are also just as likely as men to express hostility—in this case physically—in the context of a romantic relationship. The popular stereotype of a domestic abuser is a man who habitually hurts his female partner. Yet research by Archer and sociologist Murray Straus of the University of New Hampshire calls this scenario into question. Surprisingly, their analyses demonstrate that men and women exhibit roughly equal rates of violence within relationships; some studies hint that women’s rates of physical aggression are slightly higher. This apparent equality is not solely a result of women fighting back, because it holds even for altercations that women start. Still, domestic abuse within intimate relationships poses a greater threat to women than to men. Women suffer close to two thirds of the injuries, largely because men are stronger on average than women. In addition, women and men differ in the severity of their actions; women are more likely to scratch or slap their partners, and men more commonly punch or choke their partners.

In the UK, [Erin Pizzey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Pizzey) was the first person to set up domestic violence shelters in the world. Her charity Chiswick Women's Aid, is known today as Refuge.

In the 70's her research showed that women were just if not more likely to be violent towards their partners and went about setting up similar shelters for men.

Because her findings did not suit the narrative, her books were stolen from bookshops, the police had to accompany her during speeches and book signings and her dog was killed. She had to flee the UK, all because she stated that men were also victims of domestic abuse.

These days she says that there is a lot of suppression of the prevalence of woman on men violence because it's an ""industry"" worth hundreds of millions to women's charities. Considering she set up the first domestic abuse shelters and charity for women, it's a bit of a mindfuck.

Mostly it's because men don't report it due to societal impact. If you're male and being abused by a female you're considered weak and pathetic. This will likely cause ridicule and mockery from your peers, or at least that's the fear. It's quite reasonable to expect to be mocked for not ""manning-up"" and putting your woman in her place.  
Not only that, but it's just not taken seriously. How could women, who are weak, possibly harm men, who are strong. So when it is reported it can easily be laughed out and ignored.

It's even worse when you bring rape in to it. How could a man possibly get raped by a woman? Even if it does happen, surely the man likes having sex forced upon them, because all men want sex. Or so a lot of society will think.

Thankfully we're moving (albeit slowly) towards a society where the concept of DV towards men is becoming more accepted.

Alas, I had a friend's birthday to attend instead. Did get caught up yesterday evening though and wow... Just loved it. It was the same feeling of satisfaction I felt after seeing Skyfall... multiplied by 10 because I am a huge Doctor Who fan. They just played homage to the whole legacy of the show, unified it with an epic storyline and redefined the character and the show for a brand new age. 

John Hurt was perhaps my favourite part of the episode, bringing a strength and danger to the role but also frailty and loneliness. Loved the way he played off Smith and Tennant as the cranky old man, almost like a colonel. 

It was great to see Tennant back again, complete with all the goofiness and the element of time travel casanova he brought to the role. A great payoff to see the history behind his involvement with Elizabeth I. I think though, Tennant's appearance did clarify why I prefer Matt Smith's doctor though. Who plays him more as an eccentric alien who sports his own idea of cool, which acts as this kind of front behind which lies great turmoil.

So many great moments, the joining of the three over the big red button, Capaldi's scowl and then Tom Baker. I'm 27, and most of my generation went without Doctor Who throughout the 90s, but if you watched BBC2 on a Friday Night you would always find it. That's where I first became hooked. I don't know if I have a favourite doctor, it could so easily be Tom Baker, or Sean Pertwee, or even Matt Smith. Hell, even John Hurt brought so much into one episode!

The Tom Baker moment was just so touching. I guess it'll be forever read in many different ways but I like to think of it as a view of the doctor's many afterlives. In the Name of the Doctor, you saw saw the Doctor's grave and his deepest regrets, a grim earthly physical mark where his soul is just not present. I think the Tom Baker scene implied that each of his generations lives on in some way. Taking a backseat from the Doctor and becoming the Curator. It was just a beautifully poignant scene.  

And then sets up Doctor Who for the future! Makes me wonder how this will effect Capaldi's supposedly angry older doctor? Also makes me wonder whether this will be the last regeneration?

According to Home Office and British Crime Survey statistics yes. That is where the charity got their information from.

&gt;especially since it comes from a charity that deals specifically with cases where men are the victim.

It's no different to charities that deal with women victims giving out statistics.


&gt;I mean, what constitutes a ""case"" in these statistics?

Exactly the same as what would constitute a case if it were a woman. Somebody suffering from domestic violence as defined by the government.

    ""any incident of threatening behaviour, violence or abuse [psychological, physical, sexual,
    financial or emotional] between adults who are or have been intimate partners or family 
    members, regardless of gender or sexuality.""

Enough with this ""Sakho would have kept Lukaku under his thumb"" bullshit. None of their goals came from Lukaku bossing one of our centre backs. None of them. All of Lukaku's goals came from poor marking and positioning. Which, oh, guess what, isn't Sakho's strongest attribute. Skrtel kept him quiet for a lot of the game and for whatever reason he wasn't given the task of marking Lukaku when he scored the header, I don't know why, but if he had been he probably would have stopped him. The only time Lukaku looked a threat was when they broke and there was space to run into.

It was a clusterfuck of a match and tactics were thrown out the window for the last 20 minutes. It was your classic you-attack-we-attack high tempo derby. 

Negatives:

- Coutinho out wide. They doubled up on him and he was largely ineffective.
- Mignolet's distribution.
- The ball over the midfield to Lukaku caught us out too much.
- For a lot of the first half Suarez had no support.
- Barkley found far too much space and bossed the game when in possession.
- Everton were a lot livelier and more energetic.

Positives:

- Flanagan.
- Gerrard's dead ball delivery just gets better and better.
- Mignolet's one on one and shot stopping is fantastic.
- We would have lost this game a few seasons ago.

Except Lamela travelled to America for internationals so that kind of ruins that 'obvious' point.

Secondly, in response to your statement:

&gt; I can't just decide to put my rent up for the hell of it. 

Yes you can make decisions about increasing rent as a private landlord based upon whenever you like.  

&gt; There are laws which restrict when I can.

As I point out you can raise rent when a fixed term contract is renewed - which is extremely common kind of rental contract.

For a rolling contract, yes you can raise rent not normally more than once a year, and needs to be fair and reasonable, and potentially needs notice if you don't have explicit agreement from tenant - so in that case there are some restrictions. But you can still raise the rent. 

So as for my response to your statement:
(1) you can raise the rent for whatever reason you like
(2) you can do it when you like with restrictions that I've pointed out 

Here what my rental agency sent me when we did this to explain what you can do:

We've seen it in Rugby, Cricket, sometimes decisions even by replay and video are difficult to call and sometimes the video refs are wrong. Close decisions may need a few replays, from different angles to determine the decision - this has impact on the time taken to reach a decision; resulting in the game losing its tempo, flow etc.

I think the idea is that this is the very end of the war.

The Daleks close in, gathering around the planet because they *know* they're sure to win and they all want to savor the kill together. (Exterminating others is the only thing that gives them pleasure - how could any Dalek resist the destruction of their greatest enemy?) The high council sees that they're doomed and goes insane, turning evil (which is where the events from the End of Time come in), and Hurt's Doctor finally snaps and steals The Moment, which being unwilling to actually be fired (but perhaps unable to actually defy a direct command to burn the planet?) brings the three Doctors together in the hope that they'll find another way.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I worked at Amazon part time while at Uni. I was both a stower &amp; a picker. Their system is retarded, you are given targets to say stack 300 items per hour.

Items are broken down into 2 sizes so say you will be expected to pack 500 small items or 250 big items. So small items such has bouncy balls are easy to stack 500 in 1hr you could easily stack 5000 maybe even 50,000. So what you do is get small items such as them then you can skive for 3/4hr with your pals. Big items like TV's or washing machine targets are impossible to hit even with a forklift. Some big items such as say car parts that come in stacks of 100 are easy to do then you can skive on your truck. If you cherry pick good items you can sleep for half the day by hiding in an area with no camera then just set your alarm to go off every 1hr and stack a whole load of shit then nap again for 1hr.

The trouble is that after everyone has ''cherrypicked'' the easy to make target items you are left with the shit no one wants to stow. As Amazon managers are never promoted from lower levels they have no fucking idea &amp; beat down on the suckers left with shit items, they are total ignorant to this fact.

Amazon is total ass to work for their staff are under paid all the way up to middle management where as upper management and owners get fat rich of practical slave labor sent to them by the job center.

there are some smart dudes at Amazon but they are just in robbing the fucking place, ever bought something from Amazon and got maybe a random item :) That's because some one has swaped the barcodes round and ordered it for their self to a friends house.

Oh one of my fav things to do was just grab a cart with heavy shit like fridges then hand pus it for 10 miles on night shift, better than going to the gym and you got paid for it. On my last 2 weeks at Amazon I never did a days work just signed out of my gun into cleaning &amp; fucked about.

true,dav3j,flair5,,"Worryingly I think the answer is so simple that it's now becoming simple stubbornness on AVB's part.

We simply aren't direct enough.

The best Spurs players and performances of recent years haven't been off the back of endless possession in our own half. Players like VdV, Modders and Bale would look to run at the opposition or look for the forward pass, not sit back and play sideways or backwards passes all the time. 

I was very keen on AVBs general plan for our style of play, but I'm increasingly dubious of its ability to succeed in the Prem. When we get hit on the counter three times by shithouse teams like West Ham, you've got to ask the question, what good is all the possession if we do literally nothing with it?",0,1385389867,null,0,false,0,cdml6dx,t3_1resie,t1_cdml6dx,t3_1resie,null,1428515351,8,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,8
true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I agree, people saying that Sakho would have changed Lukaku's goals are off base.  Skrtel wasn't really near or as far as we know even supposed to be near Lukaku on both of his goals.  They're both from more of a team-wide breakdown in proper marking.  However, Sakho most likely would have won the header that led to Mirallas's goal.  Skrtel got pushed off the challenge pretty easily by someone far less physically imposing than him (Barkley I think) which should never happen, especially not in the area like that. Barkley isn't a small dude per say but surely Skrtel shouldn't be losing aerial challenges to him.

Both of Lukaku's goals were down to absolutely terrible marking and not really Skrtel's fault by any stretch.  I don't know who was supposed to be on him for the corner but he got a really free header there and then for the second Coutinho is standing like 2 feet away watching Lukaku get into space and finish the ball without ever looking like he wants to step up and at least apply pressure or get in the way.

That said, I didn't like the way Skrtel was so passive at times.  He like to drop off and it gives opposing teams extra space to play in and I really think a more aggressive style would do better.  We like to step up and press/pressure the other team and if everyone else is doing that then the space he opens up is a really big deal because there isn't another defensive layer to close it down.  I think Sakho's aggressive play is a good fit for our way of playing and his physical presence is just overwhelming at times, to a much greater degree than that of Agger or Skrtel.

People are going to scrutinize the defense no matter what at this point because we have 4 very good CBs and we're most likely going to only see 2 of them per match.  They're always going to be a ""well if it was this one instead of that one!"" kind of thing going on a bit.

Oh, so he's also a complete pretentious jackass. Great, fantastic.

&gt;The scale of the flashback to The Last Day Of The Time War seemed all wrong and too showy – shot on a huge set, full of extras, and packed with lavish, blockbusting special effects, explosions, and slow motion shoot outs with daleks being blown to smithereens.

It's one peek at a multi-centuries (possibly -millenia) war, the name of which makes it explicit that time travel and/or manipulation was involved *heavily*, in a sci-fi series. He talks like he's not expecting a war to involve explosions, death, or civilians panicking when they get caught in the crossfire.

&gt;The Zygons weren't nearly scary enough to compensate for the daleks' absence, resembling large, squelchy bits of seafood salad.

Going by their resemblance to octopus tentacles, I'd say the Zygons are cephalopod or mollusk in biology, so yes, they're going to be squelchy and resemble seafood. Additionally, they're *shapeshifters*; good for inducing fear through paranoia.

The Doctor(s) use the power of the Moment, coupled with their computations, to freeze Gallifrey, but the High Council either was never on the planet, or they panicked and detached their chambers from the planet and reconnected to a duplicate Gallifrey somewhere on the 'edge' of the War. The Moment is also used to timeloop the entire War, exiling the monsters from the normal universe forever.

The End Of Time takes place some short time afterwards - the High Council knows the Doctor has taken the Moment, and they've seen what appears to be the destruction of Gallifrey.

true,Aussie_Rocker,lfc99,,"- Our Belgian keeper has been, by a long LONG distance, our best signing. I was a fan of Mig before he joined us, purely for how god damned annoying he was to play against. Sahko may have cost more, but Mignolet has been for me our marquee signing.

- Sahko too, after a shaky start has shown that he can be an influential member of the team and will hopefully stick around for years to come. Keep in mind the guy is still only 23.

- Kolo is Kolo. He is the experienced defender we needed to bring in, and hopefully Agger can learn from him and become the seasoned defender we expect him to be.

- Aspas has said himself that he's had some trouble settling in, and now he's injured. A feel that he was a big fish in a small pond at Celta Vigo, which made him look better than he might be, and the move to the EPL hasn't sat well with him. I won't write him off yet though, and I hope he comes back from injury with a point to prove.

- We've yet to see Ilori in a senior game, however seeing a few highlights from our U21 games the guy has some fucking *amazing* pace. I'm waiting with baited breath to see him in the premier league.

- I don't think we've seen enough of Alberto to get a proper grasp of his abilities yet, but at 21 he's got plenty of time. I love his style and he has a great football brain. However, the guys skinnier than a 2D drawing. Similar to Coutinho, he needs to bulk up to make sure he's not muscled about by physical schemes like Stoke and Crystal Palace.

- Moses impressed me in the game against Swansea, but he's been near invisible since. This is mostly because he's been playing in the CAM role when he's a winger. Unfortunately for him, the system we're playing at the moment means he doesn't have a place in the team and with no option to buy at the end of the season I think we'll see less of him as the season goes on.

- And finally Cissokho. The man has been in a shambles. I feel the injury on his debut really hit his confidence hard, and he's not got it back yet if he even will. He's given nothing going forward except that one cross to Suarez for *that* header, and he's made more than his fair share of defensive errors in the games he's played. The fact that Flanno playing out of position is a better option than him right now says all you need to know about how bad he's been.

Let's say you want to borrow £100 for a week. I'll charge you 10% interest for the privilege, and there is an additional interest-payable 10% charge for every week you pay late. That's not too horribly unreasonable is it? Let's assume you're late paying by one month.

Week 1: £110
Week 2: £132 (£11 interest, £11 fee)
Week 3: £158.60 (£13.20 interest, £13.20 fee)

Week 5: £216.36 (£18.03 interest, £18.03 fee)

You are completely misunderstanding my point. During the sheriff game, Lamela played both on the right cutting in and on  the left cutting in. In that game he was way, way more productive cutting in from the right. Therefore playing him on the left makes him a lot less productive than when he plays on the right. Playing him on the left is therefore a poor decision.

IM using the sheriff game as an example but its not the only one. When Lamela played for Roma, he was never as effective playing on the left as he was on the right.

true,MatthewMatic,cnty-expat,Expat East Anglian,"I was under the old system for which fees were lower but had to be paid up front. However, the low income of my household meant that my LEA paid them. Other than that I had no grants, bursaries or support from parents. I just had my loan, and it was enough. I did not need to work to support myself. (Actually, now I think, I did get a couple of grand in my first year when my grandfather died, but I don't think that it was the difference between life and death for me, or even that I used it all).

You are not me and now is not then. So I can't say that you will be able to do the same. I guess that the new system, with the lack of upfront fees, means that you may also be able to pay for rent and food with just your loan. But it depends on what the cost of living is where you'll be, and how much you spend on stuff like socializing, running a car, etc (I was carless and went to the pub once a week).

I wouldn't worry about racking up a huge debt. I just think of it as a graduate tax that I pay in addition to normal income tax. The more good my degree does me (i.e., the more I earn) the more I pay. But if it does me no good, I'll never have to pay anything.

People who buy up property are doing so to secure their investments because strict limits on government borrowing means that demand for gilts outstrips supply = very low gilt returns. Who wants a security that gets 1.9% for 10 years??

Instead, lets be generous. We know what housing benefit is, so we already know the yield. Let people give us as much of their money as they want at 3%.

We use that money purely for building new social housing. We don't need to get rid of right to buy. We just need to keep pumping new property into the market. I would allow the government to acquire developable land with a CPO (at the lower of last traded value or current value) if it can be shown that it has not had a level active development on it within a certain period, and there is a local need for it. Making developable land 'time sensitive' reflects the fact that people's need for housing is time sensitive too.

Effectively, we offer people good interest rates to let the government compete with the housing builders, except the government will have a few special tools to get good value from where the private sector is hoarding land. The houses will be leased at preferential rates to local councils and housing associations to meet the 3% required yields, who can then locally rent with their own housing schemes.",0,1385394056,null,0,false,0,cdmmgvu,t3_1rd9ra,t1_cdmmgvu,t1_cdm8ocv,null,1428514748,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

THEY'RE NOT A FUCKING AFTERTHOUGHT, JJ ABRAMS!

Is almost the prevailing opinion that things like respect for the source material, or conformance to the established facts of the fictional canon, are a constraint! An inconvenience, and these writers will arrogantly suggest that writing a good story cannot work within restraints! Rubbish!

When Star Trek makes a continuity or scientific error, I figure a writer made a mistake, or didn't bother doing the research, and I get angry.

With Who, it doesn't seem to matter as much - it's wibbly wobbly, timey-wimey, a result of the universe being rebooted, or whatever, and science has always seemed to be a make-it-up-by-the-seat-of-our-pants element of Who.

It is absolutely true that a previous deck could have been shuffled that way previously, so from that perspective it is not a fact. 


However, it is almost certainly true. Here's why:


There are 80658175170943878571660636856403766975289505440883277824000000000000 ways in which a deck can be shuffled (52!)


If you figure that we've had decks of cards for around 400 years, and if you assume a million people a year shuffling decks full time for that 400 years (should be an overestimation) and figure one shuffle a minute, that would give you:
400 * 1,000,000 * 365 * 24 * 60 = 210240000000000 shuffles so far by the human race.


Now, that number might be off by a bit. You might disagree with some of the assumptions, so let's bump that number up by say a factor of thousand. 210240000000000000. Now we have a billion people shuffling cards continuously without sleep for 400 years. This should be a much larger number of shuffles than has actually occurred.

So if I do a truly random shuffle on a deck of cards, what are the odds (given these assumptions) that we have hit upon a previous card order. It should be the number of previous shuffles / the number of possible shuffles (*100 to get that into a percent). This would disregard the number of times previously that someone had hit on a repeat as it were.

So (210240000000000000 / 80658175170943878571660636856403766975289505440883277824000000000000) *100

Let me plug that into google and see if something breaks!

Google tells me that answer is 2.6065554e-49

In other words there is a 99.9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999997 chance that this shuffle has never come up before.

&gt;...the Daleks and 1970s vintage shape-shifting aliens, the Zygons. Apart from that ? Hardly anything.

This entire paragraph of stuff, returns of familiar faces, a crazy story line, a dozen other things... But aside from that? Hardly anything. Makes me think the writer doesn't understand what the words he is using mean. 

&gt;Given that it was so special, it made the decision to screen it at 7.50pm after Strictly and directly opposite The X Factor all the more perverse and, frankly, annoying.

Who the hell cares about X-Factor? Not me. Is this seriously his opening point against the special? That he couldn't watch X-Factor at the same time? Is this the Onion? 

&gt;denying us the chance to watch one of the weekend’s big TV events live

Boo hoo, I couldn't watch X-Factor because Doctor Who's 50 year special was on at the same time. Cry me a fucking river. 

&gt;It had so much going on, it was like several episodes jammed into one: The Doctor and Queen Elizabeth, the return of Rose (Billie Piper), and, mostly, the return to grace of The War Doctor.

I just can't understand stuff that has more than one thing happening at a time. DERP. 

&gt;His actions (featured in the 2007 series finale and portrayed in the two-part special The End Of Time in 2009) have been the only thing in all his lives/travels to haunt him; condemning him to an eternal life of solitude, remorse and the search for penance.

That hasn't changed. All of that still happened for Hurt, Eccleston and Tennent. That's still how they remember it happening. 

&gt;and somewhat ironic given that re-writing history (stopping The Titanic, saving Pompeii, killing Hitler) is the one thing The Doctor is always telling his companions he can’t do.

And yet he does many times anyways. Such as saving the remaining crew of Bowey Base 1. Or visiting his own grave. It's not that he *can't* do these things. It's that he *shouldn't*. The review writer I guess didn't catch that. 

&gt;he had forgotten what it most needed. It was neither scary or funny enough.

I thought it was hilarious. Sure, it wasn't scary, but Doctor Who isn't a horror movie. 

&gt;blatantly for the American audience.

So what? Doctor Who because a lot more popular in North America with the reboot. Something that I'm very glad of. 

&gt;Tennant and Smith were clearly enjoying themselves enormously - far too much, so the scene became **more about the actors not the character**. The one thing a drama should never do.

And yet...

&gt;Since his departure, Tennant’s accent had become decidedly more Cockney

HE'S NOT SPEAKING PROPERLY! MAKE HIM SPEAK PROPERLY!

&gt;one that David Tennant and Matt Smith have always been sorely missing: wisdom. The Doctor's incessant gabbling and shouting has made him look increasingly like a shallow show-off and a far cry from figures such as Christopher Eccleston

Okay, so I knew it going in, but now it's confirmed, this guy never watched the bloody show. But he's a fan of Eccleston, so SURELY he has seen the entire season...

&gt;Piper turned up not as Tennant's beloved Rose but 'the Big Bad Wolf' and The Doctor's conscience - for reasons that I'm sure made perfect sense in Moffat's universe

Obviously never saw Season 1 and doesn't know what Bad Wolf is. The reviewer seems to think they were referencing Little Red Riding Hood. Yet he praises Eccleston only a sentence previously. And she was in no way the Doctors conscious. She was the intelligent interface for the device, the Moment. PAY ATTENTION MAN! Oh wait, there was more than one thing happening.. nevermind. 

&gt;A nerdy, needy Whovian for example. Or a ten year-old..

""I'm making a fool of myself by writing a review when I obviously know nothing about the show to begin with. But anyone who does know anything about the show is a needy, lonely nerd who can't function in the real world.""

What the whole men's rights movement needs is for people to do that research. At the moment the entire movement is ran from anecdotes anonymous.

It is impossible to answer the question of if this case was actually systemic sexism or whether there were particular reasons for it. Also even if you decide this is systemic discrimination it doesn't tell you where it is. Maybe the discrimination was at the police level, maybe the CPS, maybe in the court room. Spotting discrimination doesn't tell you what the answer is.

For instance one of the bugbears of the feminist movement is that police generally don't even pursue rape cases. They'll only prosecute the ones they feel they'll easily get.

'was' is the key word here. And while you can argue that changing values account for some of the discrepancies, arguing that violence is acceptable for kids is, in fact, a subjective statement. 

But even with all that being said, how the hell do you explain Flesh and Stone? In that one episode we have the very gruesome implied violence of having your brain stem ripped from your body, potshots taken at organized religion and the Anglican church's political role(for the sake of this argument I assume an anglo-centric interpretation of the Clerics), and Amy blatantly attempting to seduce and borderline sexually assaulting the Doctor, *all of this taking place right before her wedding.*

No amount of changing values can convince me that this show was made with kids in mind beyond the first few seasons. Which makes sense, because that was a time period in which things like 'genre' and 'kid friendliness' were relatively unexplored concepts.

When the defense gets keen to an offensive strategy, it's really a good idea to start opening the field up. Even in the first half when we had possessive control, our midfield failed to make things happen. That's where VDV and Modric excel; they can open the field up and make plays. They are play-makers.

I would literally cream my jeans to watch what Soldado could do with a creative CAM like VDV. You see, our possessive control of the ball means that box-to-box midfielders like Paulinho aren't really needed because we have good control of the ball in our offensive third.

You're largely right, of course, but I was under the impression that there was a strain of Loyalism that was rather religious in tone and tended to phrase the conflict in religious anti-Catholic terms - not a miniscule strain either, since I'd surmise that Iain Paisley and chunks of the DUP tend to see the conflict in terms of resisting catholicism, and there's definitely a religious tone to the policies they're currently propounding in the Northern Irish parliament.

Out of the paramilitaries, the LVF, one of the Loyalist terror groups in the late era of the Troubles, did have a spot of zealotry about them, though their religion didn't stop them selling drugs, or murdering taxi drivers or their fellow Loyalists.

There is a saying that in Northern Ireland, Loyalists are scared of Catholic*ism*, Nationalists are scared of Protest*ants*. I'm sure it's not 100% true, but it does partly reflect how people on different sides saw the conflict.

It's pretty well established now that Susan is the Doctor's actual granddaughter, but it's unclear if she's a Time Lady.  If she never entered the Academy or got her own TARDIS, and that is a prerequisite for 13 lives, then that would possibly explain it.

He absolutely can defend, and he defends very well.  I would put his defensive positioning and decision-making above every midfielder on the team, with the possible exception of Lucas.  Even Lucas I don't think is quite as good, but his excellent tackling more than makes up for it.  I don't remember him giving away any silly fouls yesterday, and it's certainly not a habit of his.

The ""he only passes sideways and backwards"" criticism is hackneyed, and put forward when people don't have real things to say about his play.  We said the same thing about Hendo forever and it was equally inaccurate then.  Allen does pass sideways and backwards a lot.  So does Lucas.  It's just because they're both players who are good at circulating the ball.  During the derby, we struggled a lot to hold on to the ball for more than about thirty seconds.  Allen was one of the few players who could be relied on to keep the ball nearly every time he got it.

Moreover, Allen can and does pass forward.  He's not Stevie G, so he doesn't hit the fifty yard balls that we all notice and oooh and aahh at, but Allen will make precise, effective passes going forward.  His decision making on offense is almost as good as it is on defense.  He doesn't take many risks, but he doesn't make many mistakes.  And besides, we have plenty of players on the field who are supposed to take risks- Gerrard, Coutinho, Suarez, Sturridge- and Allen doesn't need to mimic them to be good or an effective part of the team.

Look, I'm a huge Hendo fan and have been for a while, but Allen will turn out better than Hendo.  His passing is much more precise, and he's tidier on the ball.  Hendo has a much better engine, and is stronger, but Allen is smarter by a long shot.

true,HohenheimOL,smith,Smith,"I think we're just arguing different interpretations of the term 'kid's show' here. In my mind, 'kid's show' implies it is specifically manufactured and aimed specifically at children, prioritizing their entertainment above that of adults. Classic who you could argue did that, but with the romantic overtones of the 1996 movie and onward you can not. That role was taken up by the Sarah Jane adventures/K9. 

Not that I think it's a strictly adult show, either. That falls to Torchwood. My point is that if you hold DW to a standard of avoiding sexual content/violence(which is kind of the reason we have the content rating system), you're missing the point of the show. Of course it's usually appropriate for kids. It's not at all unheard of for a piece of media to have a flexible viewing age. My 11 year old cousin saw all the entire Dark Knight trilogy without batting an eye. But when talking about what the show prioritizes, its main priority is to be intellectually engaging, with being watchable by kids being a nice thing to have, but by no means a necessity. That's why we haven't had a Moffat era equivalent of ""Fear Her"".

That whole long-winded rant aside, I suppose that the entire aforementioned gray area is a result of the show's amorphous nature, especially in recent years. Classic Who made a point of assimilating any and all new forms of genre as they showed up. In that way, it was always a sort of hodgepodge of different genres. But the fascinating about the revival series is that it takes this characteristic, which I would argue is the defining trait of Doctor Who, and takes it to the next level, simultaneously expanding the show's worldliness and smoothing out the jarring shifts in tone on a level that the classic series never really achieved.

I would argue that when Moffat called the show a kid's show, he meant it in the metafictional sense.

However, I am rather dubious of that article. I don't see where it's getting its figures from, so it would be great if we could audit it that way.

So, maybe you're right - Labour didn't reverse an extremely popular policy immediately after coming to power.

But if we look at [this graph](http://i.imgur.com/kPn72FE.png) (from that article you just linked to), the claim that ""Labour sold off more council houses than Thatcher"" is entirely dependent upon stock transfers - those were done by local councils scrabbling to protect their housing stock, transferring them to housing associations.

I'm pretty sure those housing associations were all not-for-profit, and many of them part-owned by local councils - my mother was involved in the local council's housing department at the time, and IIRC the deal was that the local council held a stake and a seat on the board (or something like this) and that priority would be given to tenants identified as being ""in need"" by the local council.

The only reason those transfers were permitted was on the basis that the properties remained as social housing.

Local councils were unable to build new stock under Thatcher because any homes they built were at risk of right-to-buy, and they were prohibited from reinvesting that money in building. I might guess it took them a while to figure out how now to meet their housing needs, and to establish these NFP housing associations and how to work with them.

Yes, you're right that Labour didn't immediately remove the right-to-buy, but the avalanche had already started by then - the second column of [that graph](http://i.imgur.com/kPn72FE.png), the one labelled ""right to buy"", shows that fewer actual right-to-buy sales occurred under Labour.

I don't know about the numbers for house building, and I'd love to discuss this article with someone who knows more, because IMO this article entirely lacks nuance.

true,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; But this becomes a justification for taxation to produce anything. I think it's pretty clear that comedy panel shows, political comedies and sketch shows are able to survive privately. (Peep Show was the best thing Mitchell and Webb ever did and that was on Channel 4.)

That's the point of a progressive taxation system though. You take from the masses, more from the rich of course, and then re-distribute that based on the good of the whole not simply the powerful or rich minority. 

One of the best things about Europe compared to America is we still believe in a lot of ""community"" spending, paying for stuff that yeah sure it doesn't benefit you directly but we understand it makes the country a better place overall.

I take the point about C4 not being funded by taxpayers, but it is *controlled* by the government, and therefore voters. Some of the comedy shows (even say, Peep Show) may not have even got to air on ""traditional"" corporate channels. 

&gt; Like I said, channels like HBO and Channel 4 can create high brow stuff without needing a subsidy. I wouldn't even mind if there was a (much lower) tax to pay for evidently public interest stuff, as long as it was done on a more rigorous program-by-program basis with clear reasoning.

Can't really speak for HBO simply because I've never knowingly gone out of my way to watch the channel. As far as Channel 4 goes though it takes a lot of risk on ""not mainstream"" shows because it has to, not because it makes the most financial sense. I mean this year C4 operated at a 30m loss, in a commercial network it would cause panic, but I'm sure the bosses at C4 aren't overly worried, their job is (relatively) safe.

true,RMackay88,tardis,TARDIS,"Ok two points:

1) The use of the Moment and the Time lock are different things. The Moment was (or wasn't) used at the end of the Time War, where the whole Time-War became Time-locked to stop so many time-travelling paradoxes. 

Dalek Caan struggled (but succeeded) to break through the timelock from near the beginning of the time-war. It basically stops past or future timetravellers from travelling into this period, but doesn't stop present time-travellers from travelling around this period.

The 8th Doctor or the War Doctor could not travel back to the early days of the Daleks to stop them becoming a threat (AS the 4th Doctor did)  because that sort of time-travel is time locked.

2) In Gallifrey's perspective, End of Time happened **before** the end of the Day of the Doctor. On the last day of the Time war, the Dalek's invade Galifrey, Arcadia falls and The War Doctor shoots the ""No More"" message and steels the Moment.

We then see two different Time-lord leaders: 

The War Room in The Day of the Doctor.

&gt; ANDROGER: The high council is in emergency session, they have plans of their own.

&gt;  THE GENERAL:  To hell with the high council, their plans have already failed Gallifrey is still in the line of fire. So, he [the Doctor] was there then.

&gt;  ANDROGER: Left a message, a written warning for the Daleks. He's a fool.

&gt;  THE GENERAL: No, he's a madman. 

&gt;  ANDROGER: As you can see sir all Dalek ship surrounding the planet are now converging on the capital. But the sky trenches are holding.

&gt; THE GENERAL: Where did he go next?

&gt; ANDROGER: What does it matter, this is their biggest ever attack sir. They are throwing everything at us.

&gt; TIME LORD: Sir, we have a security breach to the Time-Vaults.

&gt; THE GENERAL: The Omega Arsenal, where all the forbidden weapons are locked away. 

&gt; ANDROGER: They are not forbidden anymore, we've used them all against the Daleks.

&gt; THE GENERAL: No, no we haven't.

&gt; ...

&gt; THE GENERAL: The Moment is gone.

&gt; ANDROGER: I don't understand, what is the Moment, I've never heard of it before.

&gt; THE GENERAL: The Galaxy eater, the final work of the ancients of Gallifrey, a weapon so powerful the operating system became sentient. According the legend, It developed a conscience.

&gt; ANDROGER: And we've never used it.

&gt; THE GENERAL: How do you use a Weapon of Ultimate Mass Destruction when it can stand judgement on you.

The High Council in the End of Time.

&gt;  RASSILON: What news of the Doctor? 

&gt; CHANCELLOR: Disappeared, my Lord President. 

&gt; PARTISAN: But we know his intention. He still possesses the Moment, and he'll use it to destroy Daleks and Time Lords alike. 

These scenes take place almost simultaneously. While the War-Doctor was adventuring with Tennant and Smith, The High Council tried and failed to bring Gallifrey out of the time lock. When the War-Doctor comes back he carves another message ""Gallifrey Stands"". 

&gt;  ANDROGER: Another one. 

&gt;  THE GENERAL: Are you sure the Message is from him.

&gt;  ANDROGER: Oh yes, 

&gt;  THE GENERAL: Why would he do that, whats the mad fool talking about now.

It is at this point the Doctors contact the War-Room and they save Gallifrey.

tl;dr: The Events at the High Council and their attempt to rescue Gallifrey and destroy the Universe happened between the two Gallifrey War-Room scenes in The Day of the Doctor.",0,1385400670,null,0,false,0,cdmp1kh,t3_1rf9xg,t1_cdmp1kh,t3_1rf9xg,null,1428513530,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I think Rodgers is just as frustrated as the FA as he is with Sturridge for playing. Just as many managers have been after their key player returns from international duty with a knock.

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"Last year this time, we were still conceding goals left &amp; right. Yes; City put 6 past us yesterday, but we've only been scored on in 5 of our twelve games in the Premier League, and only in 2 of those games have we conceded more than 1 goal. Our defense has been very good this year, despite the aberration that was yesterday.

Last year, in counterpoint, we were scoring plenty but couldn't keep goals out of our net; we'd kept only 1 clean sheet through 12 games last year.

Our defense hadn't had time to learn AVB's systems &amp; style, and as a result, we struggled to keep the other team out of net.

This year, we've only added 3 defenders, and 2 of them were already Tottenham players returning to the side (Kaboul &amp; Rose).

Offensively, though, we started 4 players in our front 6 who were bought in 2013 (Soldado, Lamela, Holtby, Paulinho). Our problem is that we lack the cohesiveness, chemistry, and comfort in AVB's system offensively, but from my watching of the games, we've looked far, far more dangerous our last two games than we have at any time before that.

Remember the Arsenal away game last year? 5-2, AVB out, he's garbage... except we bossed the game until Ade got sent off. We looked genuinely phenomenal until we were reduced to 10 men; then AVB got super aggressive, went 3-5-2, and we got cut apart on the counter.

Against City on sunday, we gave away a silly early goal; But for the first 30 minutes, we had City on their heels; we had a couple good chances we couldn't quite turn on goal, and a few long-range efforts that tested Pantilimon. The result was shit,but we were on top and pressing until City started cutting us apart on the counter.

Is it frustrating not scoring goals? Heck Yes. But not more frustrating than conceding after the 80th minute in almost every game and dropping a mess of points because of it. AVB figured that out, and over the second half of the year, we were the best 2nd-half defensive team in the Premier League iirc.

true,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt;And I'm happy to pay for things that clearly have a social good. But Eastenders? Strictly Come Dancing? Songs of Praise? Something is a social good just because some other people like it. You may as well subsidise people to go to rock concerts.

It's less the specific programmes that benefit the social good and more the concept of a channel that will sometimes provide for a minority, instead of forcing the minority to always watch what the majority wants.

&gt;t's about double that, and it's £150 a year I really object to spending, particularly when I'm holding up my household on one income at the moment. If you think it's worth it, great, but I don't. I shouldn't have to pay for it so you can benefit by not getting ads. If it's as great value as everyone reckons it is, I'm sure the majority of the country that are fans could pay 20% more and it would be viable on a subscription model.

You're right, it's about 41p a day. Still worth it in my mind, the problem is though you may think for example the NHS ""isn't worth it"", but that's not the point with these big government backed schemes. One for all and all for one etc.

If you disagree with government schemes like the NHS too then that's fair enough, I obviously wont convince you otherwise, but the principle behind them both is the same.

(Correct me if I'm wrong on any of this. It's been a while since I watched through *The End of Time,* mostly because I can't bring myself to watch Tennant's end again.)

So he says he just married Elizabeth. I take that to mean that *The End of Time* occurs right after *The Day of the Doctor* in Tennant's timeline. So the Time Lords still think that the Doctor has ""The Moment"" because their world hasn't been destroyed. The High Council is trying to come up with a plan to save themselves before the Doctor uses ""The Moment."" When the Master finds the White-Point Star, that brings Gallifrey out of its frozen state (that the 13 doctors put it in) for a brief moment. When Tennant's Doctor destroys the White-Point Star, he believes he's sending them back into the war because he has no memory of saving Gallifrey because of the paradox created by him being with the other two Doctors, but in reality he's sending Gallifrey back into its frozen state. 

Then Tennant's Doctor dies, regenerates, Smith's Doctor lives, and we fast-forward to the end of *The Day of the Doctor*. Smith's Doctor will be able to remember everything that happen because he's experiencing everything in his present, unlike the other Doctors who are witnessing their future. Smith's Doctor promises himself to finding Gallifrey. (Presumably the actual planet wherever it may exist, not the painting? I'm still confused on this part...)

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; It's outrageous that families can stay in them at below market rent forever even if they become high income, while genuinely needy people are put into B&amp;Bs.

The only reason for this is that we've managed to get into such a shortage, though.

People have lifetime tenancies on council houses, because you *should* be secure in your home - you shouldn't have to worry about being kicked out (with 8 weeks notice) just because the landlord wants to make his property more profitable.

Like I said, back in the day, *one third* of the population lived in council houses - no-one ever thought there'd be a shortage. Everyone had a de facto *right* to a council house, and the only people who are still living in them (at below market rent, with high income) is that they never took advantage of the right to buy themselves in the first place.

If you want Bob Crow to stop living in his council house, then that's fine - he'll just buy it at massive discount, because that's the right to buy that Thatcher gave him. Now he no longer lives in a council house, now we have one less council house that will be returned to social use when the occupant dies, and now we have one more former council house that will be inherited by someone's children and eventually become private rented.

I don't mind if social housing is run by the council or by housing associations. Generally speaking I'd expect a housing association to be more efficient than a council, as long as I don't now have to apply to multiple different housing associations, instead of a single application to the council. 

What is important about Thatcher's actions was that she ended the de facto *right* to a council house - back in the 70's and 80's you had a right to one, and I had a right to one (effectively), and those genuinely needy people got taken care of first.

She changed society's attitudes towards social housing, and she is why you think it's wrong for ""unneedy"" people to live in council houses and you don't think it's wrong for private landlords to make a profit renting former council houses.",0,1385402825,null,0,false,0,cdmpysn,t3_1rd9ra,t1_cdmpysn,t1_cdmou5k,null,1428513099,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Moffat retconned the origins of nuWho, and he came up with some fairly juvenile hand waving to try to appease those of us who thought that those origins were critical to the stories of Nine and Ten.  You can't have it both ways.  The Time War, the Moment, and the Doctor's decision to sacrifice Gallifrey to save the universe from the Time Lords and the Daleks cannot both not have happened and have been the motivating principle behind two regenerations of the Doctor.

It is very possible to understand perfectly what Moffat did, while simultaneously disagreeing completely with it, and feeling like it fundamentally undermines earlier canon.  How do you reconcile the entire events of ""The End of Days"" with ""The Day of the Doctor""?  How does the events of ""The Day of the Doctor"" not cheapen Nine and Ten's fundamental character by basing it on a false memory?  How do you reconcile the choice to save the Time Lords with Cass's utter fear of and hatred for them in ""The Night of the Doctor""?

In short, it doesn't matter, because Moffat didn't write it that way.  Those questions are *severe* continuity problems which do not have answers, and probably will never have answers.  Regardless, Moffat decided that he didn't want to have to write 12 with the shadow of Gallifrey hanging eternally over his head, so he manufactured a solution to that problem.  At this point, it simply is a fact that he has fundamentally changed everything about the show since 2005.  We will have to be patient to see if what he retconned away is worth what 12 brings.

With time travel where you allow the changing of history, you could simulate that universe by storing the state of the world at microsecond intervals, then discarding the 'old' universe when time travel occurs and picking up the new one at the arrival point (now with added time travellers) to carry on with. Or continue to run both threads independently for a branching multiverse arrangement.

But a course of events where events at time A causes events at time B and events at time B cause events at time A (because of the loop), and yet everything logically works itself out in a single pass... there's no way to do it; no way to know the next state of the simulation because you can't compute A until you know B and you can't compute B until you know A.

The only way you could derive a consistent simulated world like that would be to enumerate the full histories of *all possible* worlds, by expanding out all of the options - all possible time travellers arriving at all possible moments, then going through your enormous set of possible universes and culling all the ones that produced paradoxes and don't make good cause-and-effect sense. You'd be left with descriptions of simulated worlds where closed-loop time travel happened, but with no good way to explain why events happened as they did, except to say ""because if they hadn't happened that way... then they wouldn't have happened that way"", which is equivalent to ""just because"".",0,1385405058,null,0,false,0,cdmqx22,t3_1rf53h,t1_cdmqx22,t1_cdmqul5,null,1428512655,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

I didn't like how the special picked up though. Like you said, in the last episode he was supposed to go into his own timestream for the first time to find clara.

I kind of expected... actual paradox, where he starts really  messing up his own life and has to try to fix it, I wanted more jumping around and timey whimy chaos involving his own life. I feel like this was meant to be a seperate adventure from him going into his grave, even though the ONLY rule that's really been established for the doctor is that he can't go back in his own timeline. In previous incarnations he even makes it clear that it's physically impossible, so him jumping into the rip in reality that is his grave was a good ""cheat"" to that rule, it was weird to see them letting him do it anyway.

true,sacredstones,null,null,"Really? That doesn't sound like him at all. Allen is smarter than Gerrard and Henderson. He's also braver than Henderson. He's ALWAYS going to be a better midfield option than Hendo. In henderson wider role, that is debatable, but in the center of the park, Allen is more versatile and intelligent than Henderson. Give him a chance. 

Right now one big problem is that he clashes with Stevie G. They play extremely differently and the pass to Steven that almost led to a goal showed that. Allen and Gerrard were on different pages, with Allen trying to get Gerrard to go back to Skrtel and Gerrard thinking he had time for a touch. Allen wants to play one-twos. the kind of one-twos that sometimes seem trivial. Him and Alberto have a very similar mindset. the Spanish mentality. I think he'll be very important for us this season and next. but I think when he plays with Gerrard, Rodgers is going to have tell him to be more direct. Example: Pass straight to Skrtel instead of expecting Gerrard to one time it backward. 

Offensively I think he will surprise too. I think he'll get more shots on target than Henderson currently does. Why would you think that his decision making is atrocious? any examples? Just because he missed a sitter? Lukaku and Delofeou both missed lots of one-on-one chances. It happens. Get over it.

[""The Italians say the crew members fired in self-defence - after initially firing warning shots - because they feared their vessel was about to be attacked.""](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-17071474) 

""Italy maintains the personnel cannot be charged under Indian law ""

These men shot and killed Indian fishermen for no good reason and expect to be above the law? If this happened in US or UK waters there would be outrage. 

Within regard to the UK men:

[""The men were accused of illegally possessing weapons on their support vessel while operating in Indian waters""](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/nick-dunn-pirate-hunters-family-desperate-2848839) 

They were caught in Indian waters with illegal weapons.. they were arrested, they should now follow due process and be charged and have the chance to defend themselves at trail. 

Yes it is bad the Indian authorities have not yet charged them yet, yes it is bad that the Indian authorities are corrupt but when you have private armed guards who have illegal weapons and who have in the past (had other guards) shoot and killunarmed fishermen in your waters I can see why they are cracking down. 

What is your argument that they should be above the law? Or should not abide by the laws of the country they are in? 

[""India's Ministry of Shipping guidelines SR-13020/6/2009-MG(pt.) dated 29/8/2011 forbids private military ships and armed guards from PMSCs to operate within Exclusive Economic Zones without permission.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_military_company#cite_note-32)

&gt;and that the job definition of maritime security is to be classed as 'mercenary' work?

Oh sorry [""Private Military Contractors"" but really there is not much difference](http://science.howstuffworks.com/mercenary5.htm) 

&gt;Would you say that the Securicor man with a gun, escorting money from a bank is also a mercenary? 

The Securicor man should have his gun legally, he should be licensed by the state to carry that gun, he should have gone through checks to carry that gun in that country. 
The allegations against these men is that they did not have these guns legally. That they took illegal weapons into Indian waters. 

&gt;I presume you assume that they are gallivanting about the ocean firing at what they see fit 

[Well as you pointed out before they some times do...](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2102205/India-furious-Italian-ship-kills-fishermen-Keralan-coast.html)

The rise of private security companies like Blackwater (ACADEMI) and many others operating all over the world is a serious concern. The fact that they are being glorified as ""Pirate Hunters"" is worrying and their disregard for the laws of the countries they operate in even more so. 

[""People working for private military and security companies (PMSCs) have been accused of engaging in a number of human rights violations including the abuse and torture of detainees, shootings and killings of innocent civilians, destruction of property, sexual harassment and rape, human trafficking in the recruitment of third-country nationals, weapons proliferation, and participation in renditions.""](http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/business-and-human-rights/private-military-and-security-companies)

I don't know if you were a fan of the old series or not, but if you were, you'd understand how very big of a deal it was that RTD *destroyed Gallifrey* Like, ""Hey, I'm going to bring back the series that everyone used to love... by destroying a main piece of the Doctor Who Universe"" Many people were upset, but he made it work. 

But just because one showrunner decided he wanted to destroy the main character's home planet, doesn't mean it had to stay that way. That's the beauty of Doctor Who. Time Travel makes for a hell of a retcon device, and when used and explained correctly, doesn't even come across as a Retcon. Which if you paid attention, Moffat did swimmingly.

""The End of Time"" which I assume you were referring to also stays intact. It's mentioned that the Time Lord Council's plan had ""already failed"". This is referring to Rassilon and his council bringing Gallifrey through the Master. It failed because as 10, 11, and War Doctor are getting their shit together, 10's going through the ""The End of Time"" scenario, sending the Time Lords, and Gallifrey back. 

As for saving the Time Lords, it's the children. 4.7 billion children. That was a major plot point, did you really miss that? The Time Lord council went crazy with their plan, and war creates a lot of bad people, but there were obviously innocent Time Lords too. THAT'S how you justify it.

For comparison, one of those case examples involved a man spending 27 hours in custody and being left in suspence for 3 months before the accusation was withdrawn/found to be false (site doesn't specify) - the defendent got 2 years in that case. It seems to this legal layman that the length of the sentence seems to be largely determined by the amount of damage done to the falsely accused and in this case her relatively swift withdrawal presumably stopped the accused from enduring the level of public scrutiny/stigma rape defendants are normally subjected to. 

(also the last case example notes that, ""The longest sentences are reserved for cases where an innocent person has been maliciously targeted"" and in this case I'm guessing her accusation - following sex that she thought indicated a continuation of the relationship - was treated more like a 'heat of the moment' murder than a premeditated killing).

&gt;The Central Committee repudiated the metaphysical logic harmfully promoted by Aravindan Balakrishnan in opposition to dialectical materialism and the concrete analysis of concrete conditions. This was especially manifest in his retrospective examination of history and passing judgements on past activities in such a way as to suggest that today’s conclusions could have been gained without the experience of practice and the successes and pitfalls. Aravindan Balakrishnan through this one sided logic tried to absolve himself from all the policies and decisions he participated in taking, and from the responsibility of summing up the effect of those policies and the way forward from them. At the same time he uses the same logic to condemn the entire Party, its rich experience as well as to condemn the historical process for not unfolding in a different manner. Aravindan Balakrishnan uses this logic to suggest that if we had known yesterday what we know today, then yesterday’s attempts to participate in the real world and move history forward would have been unnecessary. Obviously this logic propounded by Aravindan Balakrishnan is just another form of the idealist theory of knowledge because today’s conclusions have only become possible through the experience gained in the past and could not have been reached any other way. Aravindan Balakrishnan is suggesting that with ’more understanding and with a few dogmas and some quotations from Marxism it would be possible to bypass the arduous struggle of participating in practice to move the world forward, avoid all mistakes and build a conscious and advanced vanguard Party without basing this on leading the revolutionary struggles of the people in practice, and applying Marxism-Leninism to this task.
