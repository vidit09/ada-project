One thing we are learning from all this is the complicated route this meat takes: from Poland to Ireland and then the UK.

true,therespoutineinmyear,null,null,"Wouldn't put much stock in that. Extrapolating from points per game is entirely useless. For example, our draws at the Emirates and Etihad will have reduced our projected totals by this metric. Another example, Arsenal went on and won 7 straight around this time last year to claw back 10 points on Spurs when, based on points per game, they had absolutely no right to do so. Another example, points per game certainly did not predict our dire second half of last season.

Teams cannot overtake one another in a points per game projection, everyone finishes in the spot they are currently in but with a handful more points. Points per game is ONLY a reflection of what has passed and has ZERO projective value in football. People like to tinker with it, as the author did in the linked article, by picking and choosing patches of form but then it becomes wildly biased.

The facts are: we have the easiest schedule of Chelsea, Spurs, Arse, and Everton, with Chelsea the only one that's even comparable. We've stumbled upon some very promising form and are playing much better than at the start of the season. But we are starting from way behind. If we go on a run like Arsenal last year, and we are more than capable, that graph goes straight to pot.

Least favorites:

**Vampires of Venice**. I can't quite place my finger on what it is about this episode I just find it boring and it really doesn't work for me. I think part of it for me is a bit of carry over, it always kinda bugged me that Amy was so ready to cheat on Rory and during that whole episode I kind of feel like Rory is just okay with it.

Sorry gotta disagree with you on this one OP, **Turn Left**. Part of the reason I love the show so much is just simply watching The Doctor be The Doctor, so in that episode while it's pretty interesting to see how everything went so wrong just because Donna never met The Doctor I always just find it a bit boring. One positive about it however, the moment when Donna realizes she's going to die is pretty heart wrenching.

Favorites:

My apologies out the gate but I'm actually going with six episodes here, in my defense two of them tie together and then another three do as well. Basically the last half of season three.

**Human Nature** and **The Family of Blood** is just a great one in my opinion, especially the second part, it's great watching John Smith struggle so much with going back to being The Doctor, and it always gets me just how heartbroken the girl ends up being about it all. My favorite part though is the very end, when you get a glimpse at just how brutal The Doctor can be when you cross him.

**Blink**. I don't think I need to go on about this one.

**Utopia**, **The Sound of Drums**, **Last of the Time Lords.**  This is hands down my favorite Doctor Who experience. The return of Jack Harkness, the discovery he can't die and the revelation that he is the Face of Boe, brilliant. Everything about these episodes is great, I love watching The Doctor be completely out of it only for him to have had a plan all along, I really just love these three episodes. John Simm as The Master is just great, I absolutely love his performance in it. [My personal favorite part out of all three episodes.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bbb56jZo0rE) Normally if I throw on a random episode of Doctor Who it's one of these three, typically the last one, all three if I have the time.

true,Ultimaz,null,null,"I came up with this while I was trying to wrap my head around the logic behind the past few seasons. Who blew up the TARDIS? And why? I mean, the Silence is trying to save the world because they believe that the Doctor must NEVER say his name. I don't know why the name is so dangerous, but the Silence seem to know a lot. Maybe they are right. But then, if they are trying to save the world, why blow up the TARDIS? With that much knowledge at their disposal, how did they not know that blowing up the TARDIS would end the universe? So to me the conclusion is quite clear: the Silence were not the ones that blew up the TARDIS.
 
Then the part about fixed points. This has been a recurring theme since the 6th season. They are basically all based on foreknowledge. The Doctor knows he must ""die"" at lake Silencio, so he goes there. (Note that the Silence created the fixed point by making Amy tell the Doctor what she saw at the lakeside) The Doctor knows he must break River's wrist, so he does. The Doctor knows that the last time River saw him before the Library was at the Singing Towers of Darillium. He still takes her there (as seen in Night and the Doctor). The Doctor knows he will visit the fields of Trenzalore, that at a moment where he cannot speak falsely or fail to answer, someone will ask ""doctor who?"". And I'm 95% certain that he WILL go there. He knows it will happen, so it must happen.
 
So then, connect the dots. Someone has been leading the Doctor towards this event at Trenzalore, by throwing foreknowledge in his way. The 11th Doctor's life has been leading to this. In the end, the Silence were only there to deliver the message.
 
Oh, also, I love the character of the Valeyard. I think he should return to the series. It is known that the Valeyard was created during or after the Doctor's 12th regeneration. Of course, he has regenerated 10 times so far, so his next regeneration will be the 11th one, but with some creative counting we can add one. For example, we could count the one in The Stolen Earth / Journey's End. There are other examples.

Seriously, though, no I can't. Incest was not illegal in the UK at one time and is legal in many countries [today](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_regarding_incest).

A lot of the opposition to it comes from a conflation of incest with child abuse, and there it is certainly reasonable to question how it would be possible to know that incest was consensual and not influenced by the power relationships existing between family members. There is an interesting article [here](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6424337.stm). If it became a widespread practice it could create complications for our understanding of what a family is and could be a force for change within society, which is generally considered a bad thing, even if the kind of changes it led to were objectively beneficial.

true,tatertot1000,rose,Rose,"Okay. Here we go.
So. The whole first series the doctor and rose are working up this relationship of loving trust and a mutual agreement that he is not going to take the slow path and she will stay with him forever. He ""Doesn't do domestic"" and she is completely fine with that. 
Then we get to the second season. The new new doctor is all talkative and goofy and she likes him. When Rose meets Sarah Jane, she is insecure and jealous at first, but they quickly become fast friends. She asks the doctor if he will ever leave her behind. **THIS IS IMPORTANT** He told her that he wouldn't. Not to her.
WHAT DOES THE DOCTOR DO THE FUCKING NEXT EPISODE? HMM?
He abandons Mickey and Rose on a space ship in the future to save a woman that he met that day to have the slow path with her. THE SLOW PATH.
I'll get back to that in  a minute. Let's talk Reinette. She is a beautiful, accomplished, brave, brilliant, rich, powerful, ect. Now a normal person would say ""Well no wonder the doctor fell in love with her."" But the THING is the doctor doesn't DO that. He cant afford to. But since Reinette looked in to his mind he thought finally he had met someone who had seen his past and understood it and accepted it. He was essentially fantom loving Reinette. (I have to tell this to myself because if he really did fall in love with her in a day, real true love, then the doctor is an ass who does not deserve rose.) I think that Reinette was a distraction for the Doctor because he could feel himself getting close, too close to Rose. I just cannot accept that he fell in love with her. It was plainly obvious in ""Parting of Ways"" that he loved her. He DIED for her for jesus's sake. But it just DOES NOT MAKE SENSE why he just LEFT Rose and Mickey for her. I don't know why, and it drives me crazy. I can not accept that the Doctor would do that to Rose, but he did. He could not have known that there would be a way back. HE LEFT THE GIRL THAT SAVED HIM FROM THE DARKNESS OF HIS PAST IN AN INSTANT. He just LEFT her. He was completely ready to leave his TARDIS, which is the only thing that is truly his family, HIS FUCKING TARDIS, the girl (I THOUGHT) he loved,  just like *that*. The thing that drives me the most crazy about this episode is i just don't know WHY.

Your whole comment seems like you're evading responsibility. 

Companies don't just ""go bust"" - they go bust when they spend more money than they've got (or take on more financial responsibilities than they're able to meet).

It is (probably) useful for society to allow entrepreneurs to limit their liability, and I would never say that you should be punished your whole life for your mistakes, but you *have* made a mistake here - you have fucked up. 

I think it's a bit pathetic of you to post here acting like a victim, when you *do* deserve a telling off.

You could have had the foresight to close the business *before* owing people money, not waited until you're actually in debt, but you apparently chose not to do that.

Knowing the nature of business bankruptcy, we have to assume that people didn't get paid for the work they did for you. You found a legal way to evade responsibility for your debts, and other people suffered the consequences.

Sir Alex was one of the first to call up LFC and Dalglish offering help and support after Hillsborough. The very next day Sir Alex and Martin Edwards visited LFC and paid their tributes and spoke with the club. 

Little known fact is that Fergie is one of the highest donors to the Hillsborough support trust in its initial phases. It was done anonymously til one of the support members slipped during a paper interview. The week after the tragedy, Fergie and Martin Edwards made a pretty large donation on behalf of Man United. I believe we made special track suits with a ""96"" emblem for the 2012 fixture at Anfield. One of them is kept in the United museum next to the trophy room, one donated to the Liverpool museum, one to the National Football History archive. The remaining 8 were set to LFC to be auctioned off with all proceedings going to the Supporters' trust.  Fergie attended and/or sent club officials and players attended a number of funerals after the tragedy. 

So yeah, above and beyond all the murderers/victim-never at fault-munich-airplane chants, there is a deep sense of empathy and respect between us. Unfortunately, the former makes the news.

Not at all. I'm trans, too (LONG time Whovian, grew up on Four). And I was just trying to give some friendly advice, lest you unintentionally offend someone in the future and are surprised because it seemed well-received by OP. I don't presume nor do I pretend to speak for OP, but am merely trying to let this serve as a tip for most trans people you may or may not come across in your life.

A trans woman shouldn't *have to* ""retrain"" if she doesn't want to. If a cis woman dressed in those same clothes with the tallies, you wouldn't have made your comment. And some things like her bone structure can't be helped, especially if she transitioned later in life. Testosterone is a helluva drug and it does leave telltale signs on a person's body that can be hard if not impossible to erase.

And you know what sucks? When someone points out stuff like that. Even if it's unintentionally by saying, ""Well, when my brain read the tallies as dark arm hair, I could see all those other parts of your body that you probably hate that scream MALE!"" 

And yes. If it's something you would *only* say to a trans woman, and not a cis woman, then just please think twice before you say it. Trans people just want to be treated like *people.*

Again, this is just friendly advice. You can take it or you can leave it. Just know what others are hearing when you say things like that.",0,1360218502,null,0,1360218817,0,c8auryy,t3_17x0rq,t1_c8auryy,t1_c8a9c2k,null,1431217717,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

No matter what his future may bring, I hope he is able to enjoy the rest of his playing career in the manner befitting a legend.    And then after that,  anything would be just bonus.

I hope we don't lose this guy, he could give us at least 1 more amazing season based on how he's performing.  The one thing I'll have to admit though is that these *are* his last couple years playing, and maybe seeing bench time with us would not be as satisfying for him as a player than playing for some lesser club somewhere else, outside of England.  I mean, in the end Lampard is a footballer who loves the sport, and if that means he goes somewhere else so that he can get more game time, then if that's what ends up happening, I will accept it and thank him for his service to the club.  I know that he would prefer to stay, but if things don't work out that way.. all things eventually come to an end and I would rather remember some sort of a fitting last season for him with us than a last season where ""I wish he stayed one more year"".  I want to feel like I felt when Drogba was gone - He has made his incredible contributions to the club and it was time to move on.  

Not every legend's end can be a last kick that results in a European glory.  Lampard is having a good season this year, both for club and country..  If this ended up being his last season with us I would just stand up and salute the guy.  I will not taint his memory by getting upset or bitching at the ownership for being idiots.  That's just me though, I don't mean to preach.  I've seen Lampard play for us ever since he joined and he's given us his all.

A lovely drop of beans on toast for you all to see. I chose this picture because it had the added bonus of cheese; my favourite topping for this most classic of anytime-of-the-day-or-night food stuffs. 

I am an expat at the moment and miss this most marvellous of foods. 

Note: The image shows just one slice of toast. This maybe misleading. The normal adult portion (especially if it is for dinner) is 2 slices (mostly, I think)  or double what is shown. White or brown bread both work well.

Why would Suarez move to another club in England? England - Liverpool excluded - where Suarez is constantly viewed as the devil? He gets booed at every away game he plays at. He even gets hackled at Anfield by opposing supporters. 

Liverpool fans have stuck with him through thick and thin. This is a guy who lived the hard life in Uruguay, and as such, would value the loyalty and dedication afforded him by us. This *devil incarnate* is not going to play for any other team in England beside LFC. 

Certain journalists are certainly on crack if they think Suarez would move to any other club in England.

And what about when the ex-BBC Director General, their main Sunday Morning anchor, and two internal reports say that there is a left wing bias? It's also not too hard to pick up yourself. Look at the sources they quote on different news stories and you'll see that *in general* there is a bias to giving the left more of a voice. It's not deliberate, I'm sure, but most of them are of the Guardian-reading elites, and are bound to be a bit biased towards the left. Also, you'd have to be blind, deaf and completely idiotic not to recognise their almost euphoric reporting of the Arab Spring.

The way DOCSIS (which is the protocol Virgin use for their broadband) works means that not a lot of capacity is shared among tens or hundreds of homes (depending on how Virgin have their network laid out). 

A few hundred megabits of capacity is not exactly great when you're offering over 100Mbits to each customer, as it only takes a few people to exhaust that. Unsurprisingly, congestion and peak time slowdowns are a common complaint.

Meanwhile BT's network allows them to provide much more bandwidth to their cabinet equipment (can't imagine it being less than 1Gbit/s minimum), with a load of 80Mbit customers it would take quite a few to max that out. If BT is rolling out FTTP where you are then it's just game over for Virgin. 

Even if it is FTTC it isn't too bad - the point after all was to reduce the line length by moving the equipment closer to the customers. If you're really far away from the cabinet then that's just unlucky. I am about 400m away from mine and I still connect at almost full speed.

* Scotland secedes from the UK and ""joins"" the EU at some future point.

true,7Kmusic,null,null,"My first experience of Doctor Who was in the 80s. I actually started reading the stories before i ever saw it on TV. A friend of mine lent me The Caves of  Androzani novel when i was in about grade 4, in 1986. I read that book and I was hooked. I read it under the desk when I should have been doing schoolwork, and eventually it was confiscated. I went to the local library and borrowed out as many Doctor Who novels as i could. I was fascinated, horrified, addicted and awestruck, all at the same time.

 The episodes were showed on ABC in Australia, a lot later than they were aired in the UK. I watched The Pyramids of Mars (early Tom Baker) when i was about 11 or 12, which was my very first taste of DW on TV. Utterly terrifying, but I found myself wanting more. I saw pretty much everything after that through to the Sylvester Mccoy era. There was a wonderful period in the early '90s where the ABC would show all four episodes of a story back to back in one Saturday afternoon. This was mostly the late Tom Baker stuff ( around the e-space series, with State of Decay and Warriors Gate being the ones that stick in my mind the most) and the Peter Davidson era.

Then it fizzled out and the DW movie was the last thing I watched for a very long time.

Then, joy of joys, just before the new series aired, in 2005/2006, the ABC showed all of the DW  episodes in the archive, right from day 1. I watched everything from start to finish, and it was one of the most awesome experiences I've ever had. I still haven't seen everything, since some of the earlier episodes were lost forever, but it definitely filled in some gaps in my Who education.

I consider myself to be a long-term fan. I have never had the means to collect any memorabilia, but I've been an avid reader of anything I could get my hands on. I don't have a bias towards the ""old"" or ""new"" Who. I think it all adds to the overall story, and it's all worth watching. You just need to approach it with an open mind. As a side note, my mum can recall the first episode when it was aired back in the late '60s. She was a teenager at the time.

A sausage sandwich, with white bread and brown sauce.... that is the holy grail of sandwiches. Sausage in patty/square form taste different here, much more like the sausagemeat you get inside sausage rolls.

Oooohh. See now ours would be the same sort of sausage for breakfast as we would for dinner or lunch, meat with a casing. We get lots of different types, pork and apple, or  pork with tomato, really nice.

&gt; **They both criticised the cost-cutting and target-chasing culture that had developed at the Mid Staffordshire Trust, which ran the hospital.**

This is what worries me about ""reform"", because reform often skips along hand in hand with ""targets"".

When you have targets you get stupid shit happening - receptionists doing triage in order to tick a box that says a patient has been ""seen"" within 30 minutes, 2 minute appointments with a consultant who then moves you from one general waiting list, to a specific treatment waiting list - that's an expensive and pointless waste of a consultant's morning, but it means the target of being on a waiting list no longer than 6 months is achieved.

Both Labour and Tories are just as bad as each other for this.  Cameron's statement that nurse's pay will be linked to care will just mean another target - we'll see more stupid shit such as staff frightened to stop a patient smoking with an oxygen tank for fear for a bad review, time wasted freshening up a water jug that would be better spent writing up a chart and so on.

true,jimofwales,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"They are pretty awesome in principle, but in practice they are often installed poorly and result in high energy use. They need to have the correct sized ground loop - too large or too small will result in poor performance. They ideally need underfloor heating because they run better when out putting at a low temperature. This is not always possible when retrofitting. 

Also they use grid electricity which is still fairly dirty in the UK. We burn coal and gas at 40% efficiency, then suffer transmission losses, only to turn the electricity back into heat again. Natural gas burnt in a 90% efficient boiler will rival all but the best GSHP's. 

GSHP's definitely have their place, especially in off-gas regions. Also if we had a cleaner grid (with high levels of nuclear and renewables) they would start to make sense over mains gas. 

There are also lots of technical challenges to over come with connecting these pumps to the grid, a 14kW pump can put a big strain on local distribution networks. 1 or 2 might be ok, but a whole new housing development would require a significant investment in the grid...and who should pay?

true,KarmaAndLies,null,null,"Proportional representation.     

Areas still have someone to represent them, but a good proportion (e.g. 20%) of seats are decided based on **national** popularity.    

So let's say the national popularity breaks down as thus:    

 - Labour: 30% - 6x seats    
 - Tory: 30% - 6x seats     
 - LibDem's: 15% - 3x seats       
 - UKIP: 10% - 2x seats     
 - Greens: 5% - 1x seat    
 - BNP: 5% - 1x seat    
 - Pirate Party: 5% - 1x seat.     

This solves two issues: ""safe seats"" (i.e. ""wasted vote""), and ""I don't have a voice in the commons.""     

Right now, a lot of people in ""safe"" areas (be it Tory or Labour) feel there is no point even going out to vote since the area is quite literally *so* safe that statistically there is zero chance of a swing. Their vote against the popular party literally has no value. This grants it value...     

They also feel that their minority voice (minority nationally) isn't heard, even rarely, because they have no representative for their views in the commons.     

AV was a damn shitty system, but at least if we had passed AV it would have meant that voting reform had a mandate, and if everyone hated AV enough we would eventually replace it by something actually good. But since AV died because it was ""too democratic"" voting reform has no mandate and we'll never see any changes.

* If you don't like the voting system, the only way to change it is to vote for someone to change it.
*  If there are *so many* people who *don't* vote because they don't think it will make a difference, surely if they all *did* vote, they would collectively make a huge difference!
* Have you seen voter turnout? **Your one vote *does* make a difference!**
* Even if the person you support doesn't win in that particular election, the votes are still counted and if they see a significant minority of supporters growing in number every election/poll, they will be encouraged to keep trying. With time, they could break through the 2 party control. If you don't vote, then they will probably give up immediately.
* Not voting ""in protest"" is counterproductive. **No one cares about your opinion if you won't vote.**
* **It's so easy to vote**, you don't even have to go outside. Just register for postal voting!
* If you want to change anything, you aren't going to do it by sitting around complaining. **GO AND VOTE!**

The easiest way for the upper classes to maintain their control on politics and the way our country is run is to make the vast majority of the population who aren't rich bastards too jaded and apathetic to vote. **Don't allow apathy to maintain the status-quo. VOTE!**

I do not live anywhere near London, I don't go up north. It won't benefit me but my fares and taxes will of course increase to pay for it, while the railway network in the part of the region I do live in and use continues to age and fall in to the sea (not joking) because there is no investment in it.

If it had to be spent on the railways I would rather it was spent dragging other parts of the network out of the Victorian era instead of further gold plating of an already good part of the network.

&gt; The problem with national fibre is that businesses will scream bloody murder. You're essentially de-valuing their investments and going after their business model (opening it up to competition).

They've had long enough to create their own networks. BT is finally getting somewhere but FTTC is a stopgap, not a solution. As for competition, BT already has to make their fibre network open to anyone. It's only Virgin that doesn't.

&gt; They'll also be able to lobby the public against it by suggesting things like ""this money could be used on school/NHS/etc"" and ""they're deploying fibre to areas that already have it!""

Then you could argue that 99% of the country doesn't have fibre to the premises. Virgin's network is more tin-can and string, BT doesn't intend to roll out FTTP except where it is very easy.

&gt; It won't be hard. A scheme as vast as national fibre is going to have issues and inefficiencies, and all they have to do is remind people of them until the public gets sick of it (and the opposition party promises to ""scrap"" the project if they're elected).

Either the power is centred around a single figure or the system lacks the formality that's required to deal with property or children properly.  So essentially you'll have to build the system from scratch.  I suppose, considering it from a legal/administrative point of view, there are two models for polygamy which both have problems (not that these problems can't potentially be overcome).  

1. An ""individual"" model.  Each person is independently able for form marriages with any number of people.  A is married to B who is also married to C, but there is no relationship between A and C.  From a practical point of view this is a nightmare as you'll have people who are parts of multiple family units but unable to devote their full attention to any of them.  If you're divorcing someone and they have multiple spouses then how are the assets going to be divided?  It can't be 50/50 as that will unfairly prejudice all the others who might divorce later.

2. A ""group"" model.  A person is able to marry in to a marital group consisiting of any number of people, but is precluded from marrying in to any other groups.  Any new member joining the group would have to be approved.  This system is a lot easier to administer as the family group can be considered in isolation, but there is the obvious problem as to what should happen if A falls out with B and wants to divorce but still wants to stay with C, while C still wants to stay with B.

Then there's the problem of how these marriages are going to be recognized in other countries.

Now, before you say ""we have credit/debit cards already!!!"" that is incorrect. The current system does NOT pass specific lists of items you purchased up-stream to the credit card companies, only who you purchased from and for how much you spent.    

Plus you also have to support the ability to reject each individual item, rather than the whole bill which is complex within its self.    

All in all we're talking about blowing a billion or several billion pounds on this system, just so we can feel morally superior.     

PS - Plus this system would work on very few people. The vast majority who claim benefits are the so called ""working poor"" (who could just circle around the restrictions, by buying Sky with their personal money, and using child tax credits for food/etc) and the old (who nobody would force to use this system). So really you're just going after a tiny sub-set of people and blowing a massive amount of money to do so (all because your newspaper told you there is a ""problem"" that needs a ""solution"" there).

Firstly, I'm not entirely sure of the value of those WHO figures.  They were pretty thoroughly torn to shreds when they came out.  Secondly, 18th out of 180 is fairly decent (top 10%!), especially considering the relative difference between the placings isn't ever explained at all.  For all we know there's a tiny little bit of difference between 1st and 30th.

Secondly, I'm not at all sure that it is entirely cut and dried that ""reform"" is needed.  Yes, there have been scandals recently which will require looking at, but where are the stats showing how bad it is and how desperately reform is needed?

To be honest, I think the opposite to reform is needed.  My Dad used to be a senior NHS manager, so he saw first hand how politicians are constantly changing things about.  for example, in his area in the mid-90's there was one large PCT covering the region.  in the early 2000's, this large PCT was broken down into 5 smaller ones.  In the mid 2000's the number of PCTs was again greatly decreased, and the 5 merged back into 1.  Then in early 2010 PCTs were abolished for these new GP commissioning consortia, a change which is happening at the moment.  All of these changes are significacnt, and take time to work through, but almost as soon as they were finished things changed again.  Alongside this there has been the closure of many regional hospitals and centralising into larger hospitals, the issues with PFI finance and how that affects trust financing.  Not to mention there are new priorities rained down from on high (waiting lists, waiting times, targets, 5-year targets, spending cuts) which constantly impact how services have to be planned and delivered.  It's a constantly shifting landscape, and you have to be ready to have the rug pulled from under you by ministers who are concerned more with advancement to something like home secretary than anything else.

Successive health secretaries have constantly meddled, to the point that the NHS has practically been in a state of semi-constant 'reform' for the last 15-20 years, if not more.  As such any planned reform is basically pointless, since there's hardly any useful data on whether the current or any previous organisational styles are working all better or worse than what they replaced.

The most serious reform that the NHS needs, in my opinion, is for political whim to have vastly less leverage in the planning and delivery of services, and for these to be managed by people who actually know their arse from their elbow when it comes to public health.",0,1360235995,null,0,1360240311,0,c8ax1cx,t3_180aea,t1_c8ax1cx,t1_c8ajahy,null,1431218782,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,34Mbit,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"I'm going to run with what you've said, but put it under an IT umbrella with two other projects. 

The first, and most expensive is an Active Optical Network delivered to each property on the BT Openreach model (equal third-party access, etc.), which would future-proof the economy for decades.

Many decades ago BT where charged with the task of a minimum level of service to each home and business; this was a single voice channel and (I think) a 9.2kbit/s data rate. If you build a home anywhere in the UK, BT are required to plop poles along the road all the way to your property for a limited nominal fee and charge you the same line rental as everyone else. It was believed that a phoneline was an as critical part of infrastructure as potable water.

This regulatory framework needs to be updated to reflect what will be required in the coming century. Full duplex, single mode fibre to each property with actively amplified light is the only long term solution.

Once you've got fibre in, the sky is the limit in terms of what data rates you can push down it; 1Gb, 2.5Gb, 40Gb, 100Gb. The only limiting factor is demand and terminating equipment (that will reduce in cost as time goes on). 1Gb optical SFPs cost less than £50 nowadays.

In tandem with this connectivity revolution, the government needs to overhaul how it procures and commissions software. By default, all software created or commissioned by the government needs to be released under a fully-free license (GPL, or perhaps BSD), and employ continuous never-ending development models.

The third project is to merge maths and IT, starting at primary or sooner. The mental model of performing calculations on paper is obsolete. It's absurd that children are required to draw graphs and demonstrate arithmetic processes on paper. Instead, foundation maths skills need to be nurtured in the context where they are industrially relevant; programming. Multiplication needs to be demonstrated as the reiteration of addition and subtraction programatically in loops, not as handwritten tables (or worse, by rote).

What actually happened was, the previous management, with their degrees in politics, passed control over to business managers with degrees in business, not in engineering or utilities so the losses went away and it cost the end consumer more - but it isn't a tax now, so we should still be happy about it...

* Occupation by more than one person with occupiers forming separate households.

* Construction or adaptation in such a way as to allow more than one household to live in the property.

* Design, construction or adaptation for use as an HMO even when only one person is in occupation.

In an HMO the tenant/licensee occupies only part of the property and is only liable for rent for the part they occupy. An example would be where the tenant is liable for rent on an individual room basis and shares a bathroom and toilet with other tenants. **The council makes the decision about a property’s desgination as an HMO and the landlord is liable for paying the tax.**

House in multiple occupation is any type of dwelling which:

* Was originally constructed and subsequently adapted for occupation by persons who do not constitute a single household; or

* is occupied by one or more people, each of whom -
is a tenant or licensee if part only of the house, flat etc. or
has a licence to occupy the dwelling as a whole but who does not pay rent or licence fee for the whole dwelling.

Skills should add to your pay but pay should also reflect the time and effort you put in. Being a manager in a coop would be stressful yes but it would be easier than say a manager in a massive company. If for example the manager has to make pay cuts, the employees will be more likely to accept it because he is going through the exact same as them and the employees would be inspired to work harder to improve the company to raise the pay again.

That makes it 5 in favour with 3 not voting.

I would support it as a guarantee that the state is ensuring that benefits are being used as intended, and all those that it supports are getting food, shelter and utilities, and also as a guarantee for those which pay into the system that their money is being used as support. 

As a preference, I would prefer to see the bulk of benefits being provided as a basically furnished room (with a maximum market value cap) with access to cooking facilities, capped utilities equal to what most students manage to live off per person (ie. not as much as a normal family uses), and a weekly delivery of food, hygiene and cleaning staples with recipes to provide a cheap, sustaining but pretty uninteresting. After that, I think there should be some cash provision for limited luxuries or non-regular necessities, along with a slush fund that can be applied to for one offs like a smart interview clothes. Overall, I could well see this system costing more, being more restrictive and being seen as a reduction into freedom, but I think that is an acceptable cost.

I overhear managers discussing contracts upwards of £200,000 for a year long contract. My company hosts servers for various companies and provides technical support.

Regarding dry spells, there is never a dry spell with us, we support about 500 different companies and there is always new problems coming in, i rarely have a quiet day. At minimum i will go to 8 different jobs in a day and the most i went to was around 25 so on a very busy day i could make the company about £2500 and that is on top of all the contracts for support they provide.

Regarding profits, the managers in my work drive big flash expensive cars, live in massive houses and wear expensive suits. They are usually in maybe 2-3 days a week and only for say 5-6 hours each. I work 5 days a week 9 - 5.30. The company i work for isn't a massive multinational it is just a relatively successful national company. I think there is one office in London and that is the only one outside Scotland.

I get what you're saying about titles and cups. I'm not saying CFC would be better off without Roman, in terms of winning things, I know we would probably lose more, but I""m saying the team would be more respectable. 

If you could have a team where Lampard is treated with repsect, where Drogba doesn't leave because he knows he isn't wanted, where RDM isn't given a cold shoulder ... are you not willing to give up some likelihood of a title for that?  Other examples abound, of Roman's actions where some fans might think, I'm ok supporting a team that *doesn't* do x,y, and z, even if they have a lower chance of cups and titles, because I at least respect the team more. In my opinion, supporting a team is about more than just how much they win.

Because we are less constrained by external pressures (such as memorisation, clumsy language on exams, etc) we should be able to focus more solidly on expanding the syllabus to new material.

I think that is actually a good idea. We should be adding more material to subjects to objectively say ""actually kids are learning differentiation at GCSE, show me an O-Level paper that does it"".

true,ginglymus,eng-Cambridgeshire,Cambridge,"Black pudding is a savoury blood sausage, eaten any time of day, most commonly at breakfast, although it makes a good accompaniment to lamb. It's heavily spiced, richly flavoured and bulked out with oats and barley. 

Yorkshire pudding is a light, fluffy, roasted batter, eaten as a starter or side (with gravy) or, less commonly nowadays, as a desert (with golden syrup, condesned milk etc). Tastes as you would expect roast batter to taste.

Bread pudding is bread and, usually, eggs, milk, and some combination of sugar, fruit, syrup, etc, only eaten as a desert. Tastes slightly milky and eggy, but mostly of whatever you add to it.

You have missed off suet pudding, which is a sweet or savoury dish made with suet. Fillings can be pretty much anything.

Pudding (the course) is presumably so called because it would commonly consist of a sweet pudding (the dish). However, no-one would ever eat a savoury pudding for desert.

Why? The government never built or owned the railways in the first place. Nationalisation was always a temporary measure during the recovery after World War 2. The railways actually ran privately up to and throughout the whole of WW2 which was pretty impressive, and carried more passengers with better punctuality (even outside of war times).

I agree the railways need sorting out, but nationalisation won't fix anything. Look at the currently nationalised portions of the railway, they aren't some heavenly nirvana, they're exactly the same as the rest of the network (with even higher price rises!).

A quick outline of a day: 

School starting around 9am

Finish around 3-4pm

Club activities for many students until 6pm

Cram schools in the evening until 9pm.

Homework at home and then sleep.

In elementary school kids generally don't have the excessive school clubs or cram schools.  They still have homework.  Everything is extremely exam focused.  The clubs often devolve into just turning up because it's expected and the teachers don't really care about them.  

One student I teach in Japan is a very intelligent 13 year old. He puts in many more hours than the equivalent child in the UK, but I wouldn't rate his mathematical understanding as much better than a similar, intelligent 13 year old UK child.  Definitely not proportional to the time he put in.  I am certain, however, that he will destroy any test he has been prepared for.  

The real puzzle, in my opinion, is why are Japanese universities so bad.  Schooling is often lauded as being world-class, but the universities are not.  I have some wild conjectures on this that I will keep to myself.

Now of course, I'm not saying you're suggesting this system, but I thought it might be interesting for readers in this thread to find out how another country does things. Adding in exercise is a nice proposal.

However one should also expect that they not so frequently bring such incredibly flawed policy as their declared plan based not out of evidence, but vague victorian sentiment about what sounds good, and seems right and proper, and then try to enact it on very short timetables.

true,Buckeye70,canada,Half,"I've not tried marmalade from the UK, but I'm not a fan of ours.

When it comes to jam, it gets super confusing. We have jelly, jam, preserves, and marmalade. Jelly is a clear, bright product. It is generally made by cooking fruit juice and sugar with pectin as a jelling agent and lemon juice as an acid to maintain a consistent texture. Jelly is firm and will hold its shape. Generally, jelly contains no pieces of fruit, although specialty jellies, like pepper jelly, may include pieces of jalapeno or other pepper. 

Jam is made from crushed or chopped fruit cooked with sugar, and often pectin and lemon juice. Jam can be a puree of fruit or have a soft pulp, but it does not contain chunks of fruit. 

Preserves are fruit cooked with sugar to the point where large chunks of fruit or whole fruit, such as berries, are suspended in a syrup base. The texture of preserves is not smooth like jelly or jam. 

Marmalade is a soft jelly, often citrus-based, that includes both the flesh and peel of the fruit suspended throughout the jelly base. The bitterness of the peel offsets the sweetness of the jelly.

true,Buckeye70,canada,Half,"&gt; Black pudding is a savoury blood sausage, eaten any time of day, most commonly at breakfast, although it makes a good accompaniment to lamb. It's heavily spiced, richly flavoured and bulked out with oats and barley.

I posted elsewhere here, but from the looks of it, that might be similar to  a summer sausage here.

&gt; Bread pudding is bread and, usually, eggs, milk, and some combination of sugar, fruit, syrup, etc, only eaten as a desert. Tastes slightly milky and eggy, but mostly of whatever you add to it.

Perhaps that might be like Banana bread here? Or Zuchini bread? we also do carrot cake--but that has a cream cheese-based icing, so perhaps not.

&gt; You have missed off suet pudding, which is a sweet or savoury dish made with suet. Fillings can be pretty much anything.

Suet? As in fat? Hmmm....

&gt; If you're not aware of it, the one that drives me mad is flapjack/pancake. Your flapjack (a pancake) is completely different to our flapjack (oats, honey, butter, goodness).

Flapjacks/Pancakes here are basically a vehicle for syrup. And I can't stand them. They are basically flour, milk &amp; egg fried in a pan. Our most popular syrup is a godawful-sweet concoction of corn syrup and a hint of molasses and maple. You can only find the good stuff in New England, or seasonally in some areas. 

&gt; Also good for amusement is cider. Over there, apparently, it's just fizzy apple juice. Over here, it's 6-10% alcohol content.

We have apple juice, which is a kid's drink that looks similar to a light bourbon or whisky. Then there's apple cider which is cloudy and usually popular in autumn (warmed, with a cinnamon stick is a great drink). Some ciders are available here, but mostly common with drunken college girls (Woodchuck, Strongbow).

true,myimportantthoughts,cnty-uk,It's grim up North London,"This option is a huge improvement in my opinion. It has the benefit of allowing people to have a local representative while also creating a (mostly) proportionally representative parliament. There are no wasted votes, you can vote for the pirate party and it will (possibly) lead to 1 MP with no constituency who represents your views, but you still get a local MP to represent your area. Everyone's vote is equal in weight, as opposed swing voters in swing seats deciding the election. 

Criticism that there will still be safe seats is not that meaningful; I have not heard of an electoral system that eliminates this. In Tory-Upon-Sea they will always vote 70% Conservative even if the candidate is an ostrich and the Conservatives will always win that constituency and deserve the MP. That this is a safe seat is simply evidence of the population's political leanings. The problem is that there is no difference under FPTP between 70% Tory and 30% Labour Vs. 70% Tory and 30% Green Party. AV+ solves this by giving Labour / Green a seat from all of the 'unused' votes from the seats they lost, thus 'using' the wasted votes.

Brilliant!

The downside is that explaining the strategy, maths and game theory of electoral reform is beyond most people, so we will probably never get this.

Makes 8 large puds or 24 small

Preparation and cooking times
Prep 5 mins


Cook 20 mins

   Vegetarian

Heat oven to 230C/fan 210C/gas 8. 

Drizzle a little sunflower oil evenly into 2 x 4-hole Yorkshire pudding tins or a 12-hole non-stick muffin tin and place in the oven to heat through.


To make the batter,

 tip 140g plain flour into a bowl and beat in four eggs until smooth.

 Gradually add 200ml milk and carry on beating until the mix is completely lump-free. 

Season with salt and pepper. 

Pour the batter into a jug, then remove the hot tins from the oven. 

Carefully and evenly pour the batter into the holes.

 Place the tins back in the oven and leave undisturbed for 20-25 mins until the puddings have puffed up and browned.

 Serve immediately.
 You can now cool them and freeze for up to 1 month.

It should look almost like pancake batter maybe a little Runnier.

There are many things which have ""pudding"" in the name, but you wouldn't have them as a dessert.  Think of a yorkshire pudding like a pancake.  It's something you'd have with other stuff.  Either you'd have a small one beside your meal, or you'd have one roughly the same size as the plate with all the rest of the stuff inside - usually roast beef, gravy and veg but not always.

Some pies are referred to as puddings (steak and kidney pudding), not sure why though.  There may be some technical difference such as a pie is encased in pastry whereas a pudding has a pastry lid only, but I don't really know.

Bread pudding is a dessert.  Black pudding is a sausage predominantly made of blood.  White pudding is a lancastrian version of a black pudding which Iv'e managed to avoid so far.

As for ""ice cream"" or ""an ice cream"", personally if you said ""let's go for ice cream!"" I'd expect it in a bowl.  If you said ""Let's go for _an_ ice cream"" I'd expect a cone.

true,Buckeye70,canada,Half,"What we call biscuits, you'd never serve with tea. They are buttery, crumbly, and have a very light crust. Most put butter or jam on them at breakfast--or dump a white, sausage-based gravy on top.

I found this on the interwebs: In the book Baking With Julia, based on the PBS series hosted by Julia Child, Dorie Greenspan says that ""[Scones] are made in a manner similar to biscuits and, in fact, share biscuits' buttery-layered texture, but their name, their shape, and the fact that they're served with tea rather than gravy, lift them to the level of fancier fare.""

A closer look, however, suggests that the difference is not quite so superficial.  Scones tend to be richer, frequently including both eggs and cream in the recipe, though not always.  Some biscuit recipes will enrich the dough with eggs, but use milk or buttermilk instead of cream.  Scones also use a bit more liquid than regular biscuits, which should make them a bit more cake-like in their consistency. While biscuit recipes may or may not call for sugar, scones typically use sugar, but not as much as sweetened biscuits.

Scones originated in Scotland and were made with oats.  The dough would be pressed into a round and then cut into wedges, and cooked on a griddle.  While scones may contain dried raisins or currants, they are traditionally not made with other ingredients that have become de rigueur in many pastry and coffee shops.

We have every single member of parliament in the commons. Bit of tautology, I apologise. This is how I see it, anyway.

We have FPTP to elect our local Members of Parliament, then a FPTP based on those number of seats to declare which party is the leader of the nation, but we certainly still have a representational house of commons. We have a Prime Minister, but he and his cabinet are still at the woe of the rest of the House of Commons, and House of Lords. Stuff can't just be shuffled through without being presented to both houses first. Despite what news reports tell us about Milliband disliking policies from Cameron, he still has the ability to stop those policies, but for whatever reasons chooses not to. The same for Cameron when he was shadow.

The system, like all systems, has been weathered down and fucked over by various organisations over the years. The most recent being the changes of constituency borders to favour one party over others, imo. 

The vast majority of the population now just vote for a colour, typically one they have been taught to vote for by their parents and/or their peers. Very few people actually vote *just* for the candidates to be their local MP which is entirely what we should be doing. Too much focus on PM and not MP.

Personally, I do not want a fully representational system. Far, far too much bureaucracy to be a healthy system.

Tottenham will do everything they can to help Paul Gascoigne overcome his battle with alcoholism, manager Andre Villas-Boas said today.

Gascoigne has been admitted to a treatment centre in the United States after he started drinking again.

The former England and Spurs midfielder is reported to have received financial support from former team-mate Gary Lineker and celebrity friends Chris Evans and Piers Morgan towards the £6,000 a week fees that the clinic charges.

And Tottenham, where Gascoigne spent four of his most successful years, have offered to support the 45-year-old through their trust, which was set up to help former players who fall on hard times.

""The club is helping with the situation through the Tottenham Tribute Trust,"" Villas-Boas said.

""I think it's extremely sad for a player who represents so much for Tottenham's history.

""Tottenham have made themselves available to help the situation. Hopefully Gazza can recover.""

Gascoigne, who played nearly 100 times for the club and lifted the FA Cup in 1991, has suffered from alcoholism for large parts of his life.

He looked in good health when he was guest of honour for Tottenham's game at one of his other former clubs, Lazio, in November, but he was pictured looking worse for wear last weekend at an event in Northampton.

His agent admitted following the publication of the pictures that Gascoigne had started drinking again.

How do you stop a policy when a party has a majority? They have to present the policy but you can't do anything about it.

I see no problem with the legislative body being slow to act. Government's job is defined by the secondary legislative powers given to it. A government shouldn't be operating on the basis that it is going to write a fuck tonne of laws. That was precisely the problem with Labour. The job of government should be to manage the powers allocated to it by parliament. By all means put forward ideas for bills but it shouldn't come with the expectation that they can just pass anything with a giant majority.

Most of the problems with UK politics today extend from a lack of proper distinction between the roles of government and parliament.

If everyone was allowed to spend the same amount of money (perhaps the average amount of earnings across the whole league, which would still benefit clubs near the top but would penalise clubs at the bottom less IMHO) as opposed to be allowed to spend their income, it would allow smaller clubs to rise to the top far more easily. This favours the likes of us, Chelsea, Arsenal and Man U to spend big whilst the likes of QPR and Southampton have to spend small as they are small earning clubs and will be stuck like that for years to come now.

Opposition to these rules came from City, of course we want to spend our owners money! Although as we are already constrained by the European FFP rules it is a moot point for us really. We simply cannot afford to spend too much in case we break the rules and are suspended from the Champions league.

Also and quite interestingly, clubs like Aston Villa, Fulham and West Brom were supposedly against this as they were hoping for a rich benefactor and think their chances of getting a rich owner will be lessened if said owner cannot pump money into the clubs.

true,ElDingus,num30,Sandro,"Good post.  I think this season has been pretty hard to simplify so far.  We haven't really played any single match the same as the match before.  While we have had some injuries that have caused this, I think it is more so AvB not being too sure of what he can do with the personnel he is working with.  The first few matches without Dembele, we looked awful and static.  Once we got him, we had a reliable midfielder who could work under pressure, though at times he has been stifled by heavy pressure from opposing midfield players.  Bale and Lennon have both been as significant as last year basically, it is more so that Defoe and Ade haven't (or at least one of them).  Neither has been consistently performing or playing, whereas last year Ade was in form and started, often being replaced by Defoe or behind Defoe when losing.  Things have changed too much this year to say how it compares to last year to me.  We keep switching between formations as you noted, and player absences have forced AvB to change his system around a bit.  I still think it is a bit odd he resorted to a 4-4-2 given his squad he had available, and losing Dembele for those few weeks was very similar to last year when Modric was out.  I think results wise we have been similar.  Sometimes dominating in possession or attempts on goal haven't been enough to pull through a win or a very convincing win.  Other than Liverpool and Newcastle last season and Villa this season,  we haven't had many games where we were able to dominate both score and shot wise.

Many other enhancements can be added: I usually add vegetable purée to thicken mine, and redcurrant jam or madeira is a useful addition, adding complexity.

A good onion gravy can be made by slowly sweating down sliced onions in butter for about a year, then adding stock, thickening slightly with a little flour and tweaking in the same way as above.

You can also buy gravy granules that you mix wth boiling water that will give a very good approximation of the real thing.

Ade's return only strengthens my belief in that.  We definitely maintain those two deep mids, and I think the Holtby's willingness to track back means we really have only one forward in Ade, and Lewis can play the real creator role we've been lacking.

Deliberately or extremely negligently. There isn't enough evidence in the public domain to be sure. To their shame the British government have allowed this incident to be brushed under the carpet. 

&gt;The point I was making is that it's easy to say 'well, X must be dodgy, they've done Y' when you can apply that to pretty much any country in the world - so the upshot is that unless this is standard policy, it's a bit silly to highlight individual incidents as if they're the norm.

It seems that it's standard policy. There have been a lot of similar incidents. Iain Hook was a British citizen, so it's perhaps more my business than some of the others. [If the US don't want to make anything of the IDF deliberately or negligently sinking one of their naval vessels that's up to them.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Liberty_incident)

I don't think you can apply this to ""pretty much any country in the world"". Some are better, some are much worse. 

I just don't think it's either ethical or in our interest to be supporting them quite so uncritically.

So what you're saying is, is that by cutting taxes people will have more money, and that would benefit the individual, but also the government. Especially in regards to business, because more money will therefore indirectly go to the government due to the increased changed of success (such as what you were saying to the rates).

I think I see what you're saying, not that I explained it well (I think). That high taxes doesn't necessarily mean a high income for the government from the restraints it puts on people, but a lower tax rate could in fact increase what the government get since people will generally have more money, more money could therefore be spent to businesses, more businesses could become successful etc.",0,1360265140,null,0,false,0,c8b4aza,t3_1823ib,t1_c8b4aza,t1_c8aynif,null,1435631919,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"This must be from Conservative HQ, I wrote to my MP and got an almost Identical response!

Thank you for your e-mail.  How you vote is entirely a matter for you.  Yesterday’s vote was a free vote on an issue of conscience so, having listened to hundreds of representations from my constituents, who by a margin of 10:1 before the vote asked me to vote against, and after much soul-searching that is what I did. 

 

I want to see people in committed and long-lasting relationships. From personal experience and through my friends and colleagues I can see that people flourish when they are in a loving relationship, whether opposite sex or same sex.  I fully support civil partnerships which I believe confer the same legal rights as marriage does on same sex couples which I think is right and fair and had I been in Parliament when they were introduced I would have voted to support them.

 

However, I am concerned about this Bill and after much thought I did not support the Second Reading of the Bill for the following reasons:

 

·         I believe marriage to be between a man and a woman. I should be honest with you and say that my belief is, of course, influenced by my Christian faith and my membership of the Church of England. All previous changes in the laws surrounding marriage have never challenged the fundamental point that marriage is between a man and a woman.  I believe, and by a huge margin the majority of constituents who have contacted me about this clearly agree with me, that the proposed redefinition is a big social change (indeed the BBC described it this morning as a historic milestone in British social history) which I strongly feel needs far more time for consideration and public debate, particularly since no same sex couples had contacted me before the consultation to say that they felt discriminated against because they could not get married;

·         I am particularly concerned that last year’s consultation did not ask for views on whether the change should be made but simply how it should be made – and that, for this reason, the petitions signed by hundreds of thousands of people have not been taken into account.  I think this sets an unfortunate precedent for Government consultations; and

·         I think the legislation does not properly deal with some necessary issues such as the teaching of marriage in schools and protections in their employment for those such as chaplains and others with religious convictions.  Much of the argument has been about equality but the Bill does not achieve true equality because heterosexual couples cannot enter into civil partnerships and the grounds for divorce or annulment of same sex marriages are not going to be the same as the grounds for heterosexual marriages.

 

Having said all of the above I recognised that the Bill was likely to be passed by the majority of the House of Commons and I will not stand in its way so I voted with the Government on what is called the Programme Motion, so that the Bill can make its way through Parliament in a timely manner.

 

I hope this clarifies things for you.",0,1360265222,null,0,false,0,c8b4c1s,t3_182got,t1_c8b4c1s,t3_182got,null,1431222263,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,rablenkov,uk,Southend-on-Sea,"It might be helpful if we look at a potted history of the word 'pudding'.

In medieval times, puddings were usually entirely savoury - black or white puddings, made from blood or fat respectively, stuffed into the intestines or stomach of the animal and boiled.

Over time, other types of meat were used in similar ways, eventually leading to that culinary masterpiece, the sausage.  Haggis is also notably worth a mention.

By the 17th Century, the pudding evolved to include sweet versions.  These usually incorporated flour, sugar, nuts and fruit, and were boiled in a cloth pudding bag as an alternative to the stomach or intestines.

Later still, sweet puddings became more cake-like.  An example is the Christmas Pudding.

Eventually, these evolved further into the steamed puddings that we all know and love - spotted dick, syrup sponge, etc.

As an interesting aside, the Great Fire of London in 1666 started in a bakery at a place called Pudding Lane.  Most people assume that the name Pudding Lane was given because it was an area populated by bakers, but that's not actually true.  At one time, a stream ran down the centre of the road and the many butchers who owned shops there would throw the entrails and unwanted organs into the stream, eventually clogging it up entirely.  The word used to describe all of these unpleasant pieces of waste was...pudding.

true,no_soul_ginger,flair3,,"All in all, solid assessment - I do take one exception, though.  As dynamic a player VdV was, I realy, really was left wanting to see his engagement for the full 90.  He was fantastic for about 60 minutes of every match, but started flagging between the 60-75th minute.  When we needed his vision and skills the most, he'd be found at the edge of the midfield circle, looking worn out.  Playing his guts out for 3/4 of the game left us exposed for the last 15-20 min.  He's a tremendous player, and I think this had much more to do with Harry's expectations of his role than VdV's abilities.

Modric's skills aren't to be underestimated either, but he wasn't given the support on field or plugged into a style that suited his talents.  He was best in pressing an attack and supporting the shooting players.  A 4-2-3-1 would have worked to his strength: being able to back him up and let him buzz around opposing CDMs and defenses at-will.  Were he to have stuck around for AVB's involvement, I think we'd be breathing down City's collars and have a bigger GD than Arse-nal.

I don't know - I was a midfielder myself, so naturally I put a lot of stock in how the midfield affects the game.  With pressing LB and RB players, a 4 in the back makes sense - and I'm a believer in a lone CDM acting as a holding player and screening attackers from the 2 CBs...an enforcer and disruptive player, but the CBs need to be actively involved in, well, defense.  Our CBs have been physically too fragile for that, I think.  That way, an opposition build up has to come from the wings, and any opposition strikers in the middle get picked up by markers on their way to the box.  A worker like Parker or Sandro in that holding role is a ""big"" player space to have to pass around.

A lone striker hasn't ever made much sense to me, unless they're getting consistent strike partners making early diagonal runs from the wings in support - but to me, overwhelming the box and having a high midfield supporting that attack is the best way to get goals and grind down a defense, and it's tough to do that with a lone striker.  A 4-1-2-1-2 accomplishes that, prevents a counterattack from developing the middle of the pitch, but will run your CMs ragged.  Fortunately we have a deep bench of CM players...

Long balls are great - but controlling possession with short passes makes the opposition have to chase the ball around, which will disrupt all but the most disciplined (Stoke) defenses.  Agreed there.  I think the failing in scoring as many goals comes from not having as much control in the middle of the field, 25-30 yards from the goal.  VdV and Modric provided that.  Dempsey (though I do love Deuce) is too strike-oriented to sit back, so I think Dembele and Holtby are custom-tailored.   I haven't seen as many sharp crosses from the touch line this season, Lennon and Bale have made a lot more diagonal runs to/past the corners of the box than runs to the flag - the opposing defense gets compact, and clogs up the box instead of pulling them apart and leaving spaces for runs.  The LB and RB guys haven't run deep enough, often enough to stretch a defense much.  We've been dribbling through defenses, not as much playing in behind them.  Defoe's timing has been dreadful.

Friedel was brought in because he, despite flaws, is consistent.  As opposed to Gomes.  Hard to be a defensive player and commit to tackles if you're worried about relying on the #1 should you get burned.  Lloris is just as consistent, but he's a more dynamic keeper, with vision like a field player.",0,1360266627,null,0,false,0,c8b4u2x,t3_182p45,t1_c8b4u2x,t3_182p45,null,1431222471,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

true,TJP343,null,null,"I hope I wasn't underestimating Modric's abilities, because I do agree with you, he is a fantastic player and if he had stayed he certainly would have enjoyed playing for AVB. And, somehow, I managed to ignore Rafa's tendency to tire later on in matches. Could argue that if he had stayed and done his thing for 60-65 minutes and then had Sigurdsson come on for him, Spurs would be able to get by. But that's tough going into almost every match already knowing you have to make a substitution on 60 minutes. Maybe that's why Spurs weren't too concerned with keeping him?

Rafa was also pushed out wide last season when Lennon was out injured and this was horrible for him and Spurs because we all knew he would drift centrally anyways no matter where he was positioned and that's exactly what he did. That left Walker to have the entire flank to himself for the entire game. Maybe this is why Walker motored forward so often last year? He had no one in front of him whereas now he usually has Lennon.

Bale's positioning has been maddening for me because he started this coming inside too often routine last season and I hoped AVB would implore him to stick to the touchline and stretch defenses, but he has not generally done so this season as much as his breakout year in 10-11. More goals this season from Bale, but a noticeable drop in assists as well. Partly due to Adebayor's absence through injury and lack of form as well, has to be said.

I generally dislike playing with a 2 in front of the back four and like you said would prefer to see one destroyer/holding/shielding player in front of the CBs and the encouragement of the fullbacks pushing on. When you consistently have that type of system in place you're very much playing a three at the back without saying you're playing three at the back and the ensuing apeshitness from the press that would follow. 

Sandro can be/is this type of player but I don't know if Parker has the pace and dynamism to play this role for the rest of this season, which pulls Dembele back further and leaves this big empty spot in midfield that Dempsey will not drop into effectively. Holtby being deployed behind Adebayor/Dempsey/Defoe would have to help this situation and as you said maybe, maybe get Bale to think and act more like a defense stretching winger than him going into Me Bale Center Striker mode as often as he does.

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"10:1 unfortunately doesn't mean much because as a sample it isn't representative of anything. Even asking on a street corner would give you a far better idea of constituents' opinions.

The fact is that it has been widely known for a while now that this vote would pass - Labour and the Lib Dems were in favor, as were nearly all the senior tories. Very few pro-same-sex-marriage voters will have felt a need to contact their MPs. In contrast, there has been a minor uproar about this amongst certain demographics - it's hardly any surprise that far more have contacted their MP.

It's also quite likely that the demographic against same-sex marriages will be disproportionately vocal for other reasons. Notably, many non urban areas will have much more active religious networks than LGBT networks - no doubt many Church groups have encouraged members to contact their MPs. Further, I suspect the older demographic who are opposed to same-sex marriages are more politically active and likely to contact their MPs anyway.

All of this is a major reason that we have a representative democracy. We elect MPs who align with our views, and then expect them to vote in favor of those views in parliament.

Paddy McCourt has been welcomed pretty well and I'm glad he chose to play for Northern Ireland because he's a good footballer and of course the manager is Michael O'Neill who is from a Catholic background. So hopefully the situation is moving away from Catholics feeling like Northern Ireland isn't their team or that they will be intimidated if they do play for NI. I know O'Neill is trying to retain young Catholic players to keep them playing for NI and I certainly don't want to see good footballers play down south in the sense that they could be good players for NI but it's their choice and I respect it entirely.

In terms of being a bad team that's almost always going to be the case given how small we are but it's nice to rejoice in the few results that go well, beating England, Spain and Sweden in recent years comes to mind.

These companies may operate in 200 odd different countries but the roast-hedgehog and gherkin flavour flapjacks will be consumer-tested here before anywhere else. We are credited with being prepared to try anything once, with being adventurous, with appreciating that proper food, like chemistry, involves mixing stuff together with the acceptance that the result may prove fatal but may also turn lead, or potatoes, in to gold, or the new advances in cheese and onion flavouring technology.

This is from a few years ago but it illustrates the point amply, the main challenge in working in the UK snack market is seen to be keeping up with consumer demand for innovation. We will try anything once and we seek out new choccy bars and crisps like no other nation. Every British person worth their salt has the dream of discovering the jaffa cake that's better than mcvities' version, the perfect pickled onion corn snack, the definitive sausage roll. We are fiercely brand loyal to certain snack products and we spend a lot of money on them, but if just one food scientist for a rival can crack the hob-nobs chocolate and rolled oats magic and improve on it, you're talking many, many fortunes made.

In the 1930's (I think), Manchester United were so poor, that the term rag/s was said jokingly, as if their team was going to get so bad that they won't even be able to afford a new football kit for next season and will have to wear last seasons (e.g. Old ""Rags""). Manchester United fan's started referring to themselves as ""Rags"" every time, like for example ""Hey Frank, you going to see the rags on Saturday?"", so United fans were taking the piss out of themselves jokingly for being so poor, and it was overheard by other fans, and those fans started saying it. When it caught on and it become a popular used term for United, United fan's didn't like other fans calling it them. e.g., calling them poor, and so the main mass of supporters took it as an offence to their club, and so because they took offense to it, it's stuck.

Most people don't know this, most people think it's a term which means ""something like, 'a dirty united fan'"", or something similar like that. United fan's don't know where it originates from, but they take offense to it, and they don't even know why. They aren't even poor now, and who cares about a term their team got called over 80 years ago, for something which doesn't apply now. Especially with them being the biggest football team in the world.

true,stop-chemistry-time,null,null,"And in the late 80's, the IARC designated it is non-carcinogenic (or ""insufficient evidence"", or whatever their phrasing is).

The ""conclusions"" were that some cancer was found in rodents, at unrealistic doses when converted to humans (also remember that rodents are quite different to humans and compounds have very different effects between species, often). 

Bute had been used as an NSAID in humans for some time before this, and there exists no evidence of increased cancer prevalence in patients who took the drug.

One suspects that the overriding reason that horse-meat treated with bute was removed from the foodchain is that bute is pharmaceutically active in humans. A human taking another NSAID (eg ibruprofen) could have dosing complications if they ate sufficient contaminated meat. Or, a human could have some adverse effect to the pharmaceutical ingredient. This seems a much more likely rationale than some imagined carcinogenicity.

That being said, the effective dose in a standard ""horse-steak"" would be so low that you'd need to eat a lot to see any effect at all. This effective dose would be well below the therapeutic dose that you mention.

Carcinogenicity is a big deal and the IARC doesn't treat it as an ""all or nothing"" affair. I think there are three or four categories of carcinogenicity, Phenylbutazone (bute) falls into Class 3. That's the same as caffeine, paracetamol, and fluorescent lighting.

So

1) A ""funded"" PhD is one that is paid for by either a research council or a private company.  Either way, those organisations make a certain amount of funding available each year for research work in that industry, for the good of the industry.  Some of the researchers get a PhD out of it - that's the arrangement.

2) Scientists and mathematicians must have a PhD.  It isn't a lifestyle choice, it's the basic qualification of those fields.  We're not talking about people who get a PhD in poetry here, which *is* a lifestyle choice.

3) Many PhD programmes require applicants to have a MSc.  Gaining an MSc is not a lifestyle choice, it is a requirement.

4) The government does not offer student *loans* to postgraduate students. So anyone who wants to progress to PhD level (see above) must pay their course fees by some alternative arrangement.  This is the crucial issue, as addressed in the BBC article (although the article also addresses the issue of qualification inflation).

At no point have I asked for a taxpayer handout.  I paid for my BSc without a loan by working night shifts in a refrigerated warehouse.  I am paying for my MSc by working in a shop.  

The government does not offer loans for postgraduate study because, in the majority of subject areas, a BSc/BA is sufficient.  What the government has not taken into consideration is that in science and mathematics, a BSc/BA is *not* an acceptable qualification. 

All I am suggesting is that MSc students in the future should be allowed to repay their course fees over a period of time, just as Bachelors students are.",0,1360278909,null,0,false,0,c8b92ca,t3_1824t0,t1_c8b92ca,t1_c8b860o,null,1431224562,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I think we'll see - it doesn't look like many players are all that interested in sitting back in front of the defense.

Agree that Bale has been maddening...he's been very quick to rush into the middle and not as quick to let go of the ball.  I'd guess that you can hear me at WHL yelling for him to pass it, from all the way in the US.  Defenses have big gaps on the edges, he was brilliant last year at getting down the flanks and sending devastating crosses - for Ade or Deuce to be heroes, all they have to do is let those bounce off his head.  But he's not making those runs anymore, he's cutting in at 30-40 yards out and playing like a strike partner.  We need it, but when Ade comes back, we need Bale on the flanks more.

true,tfw13579,flair8,,"Ok, here's my two cents on the matter. First, if you compare this years team from last years team, I believe that we actually have a weaker team overall. We lost some great players in Modric, VDV, and Ledley, we've been hammered with injuries so we have had to play with a small team this year, and have had no in form striker for the last couple months. Also, we have had hardly any creativity compared to last year because of these losses (thank god Holtby has come in). 

With that said, I think its amazing what AVB has done to over come this. His pressing system has done amazing and he has allowed us to do some amazing things on the counter attack. Recently, our defense has been top notch as well. After a shaky start to the season, it has been one of the best in my opinion recently. AVB has implemented more of a team system instead of Harry, who just told them to go run around a bit and do their thing. 

Now for my opinion on tactics. I hate seeing the Dembele-Parker midfield partnership. In my opinion, Dembele is just a unique CDM with amazing dribbling abilities. He doesn't bring much creativity to the table, but he is good enough at spreading the ball around. Paired with Parker, we have no way to link up play while playing with two strikers up front. This leaves one of the two to make a play, which fails to often for my liking and leaves us devoid of idea in the middle at times. Michael Dawson has even brought it upon himself to play a long ball to link up play at times, thats when you know its bad. However, with Holtby now, the pairing works a little better. Holtby is able to drop back and link up play himself without leaving too much work to Parker or Dembele.

Secondly, Dempsey does not fit us. I love Dempsey, I'm an American, I want him to do well, but it isn't going to work. Until we get a Moutinho type player to pair with Dembele, it wont work. He will not drop back to link up play and his touch isn't good enough to work in the tight spaces he needs to work in, and he's to slow at picking a pass when he does recieve the ball in the middle. Same goes for Ade when paired with Defoe. He is too lackadaisical on the ball and his touch isn't good enough to make up for that. We need much quicker passing in the final third and they wont bring it to us. However, Holtby will. He is exactly what we need and I'm so excited to have him with us. He'll make us a much better team because of his set of skills.

With that all being said, I think we should play a 4-3-3, with Dembele holding. He is a great defensive mid and can screen the back 4 well, as well as making plays from deep like he normally does. I would normally say that Sandro should be holding, but alas, he is out, I miss him... In front of Dembele should be Holtby and Siggy. They would bring much more fluidity in the squad without losing too much defensively. Bale and Lennon would just have to help out and track back a lot, but I think they have it in them. 

I love the look of our squad so far, AVB has done a great job with the players he has and our future looks bright!

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"I have an agreement with my parents that they pay for my tuition outright with no repayment (my dad paid nothing in tuition so he felt like I shouldn't have to either) though I got in before the fees increased so in total it's only about 12,000 which compared with what my brother will pay next year is not a lot. He also gives me £1000 a term for maintenance and he pays my rent which is ~150 a week (yes, I also live in London, it hurts: we also have a nice place though - considered it worth the money). Both of those I will pay back on similar terms to the student loans but if shit hits the fan my dad can be more lenient than the government. 

I tend to spend about £120-130 a week but £26 of that is a 24/7 gym membership. I normally spend about £40 a week on main food maybe more if one particular item is a lot but that's rare and about another £10-20 on snacks and stuff I pick up while out (this is my downfall). the 40-50 that's left goes on nights out if I go out which is not that often or other items like coffees, transport (in London and occasionally trains home), eating out which again is rare but [I got one of these on special offer](http://www.tastecard.co.uk/) so it's worth it and the other little things I buy day-to-day. 

£1000 would not be enough to get by comfortably doing that every week but I work occasionally too. I can only work about 1 day a week because of lectures (mine are in the evening and clash with work) and societies etc but I can make upwards of £100 a month off 3 jobs or £150+ off 4 jobs if I do one a week. Not a lot but it makes the difference and means i'm only paying in net costs, at most, 350 a month, probably less, which is £1050 a term if term is about 3 months which it normally is. I can freeze my gym membership if funds are low and I have savings to dip into if need be but i've never had to. Also money from relatives etc at Christmas and birthdays tends to add a hundred or so into the pot and anyone staying over at the flat for a few weeks has paid rent for that time which has added 50-100 during the winter term.

Most Yorkshire puddings are small ones, [like these](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Roastbeef_with_yorkshire_puddings.jpg). You also get larger ones, [like this](http://images.mysupermarket.co.uk/Products_1000/46/004946.jpg) (not a great picture, but you get the idea). Not like a pot pie, but a bowl made of batter.

The best use for them IMO is [toad in the hole](http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/1231/images/1231_MEDIUM.jpg), where sausages (and sometimes cheese, onions, or similar) is baked into the batter. Absolutely delicious (best served with gravy).

Suarez has shown how friggin talented he is, he shouldn't be an 85, he should be an 87.

- 06-07 = 57 goals

So we're on track to finish around 07-08, which used to be good enough for 4th, and is also good enough for 4th in 2 of the last 3 seasons:

Prisons are supposed to be part-punishment and part rehabilitation. But it's not much of a rehabilitation if the prisoner drops dead due to lack of medical care.

Until such time as the Prison Service can offer medical care comparable to that offered to anyone else in society, then we have to accept that it is simply the wrong place to leave a seriously ill person.

Without knowing the specifics of the case (and news reports are never enough), I would be comfortable with house-arrest as an alternative to prison where it can be shown that the prison is incapable of treating the prisoner with the care and attention they are still entitled to.
