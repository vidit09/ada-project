true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Now in the Second World of the Soviet Union's dominance, there was also economic collapse... a stagnation of the command economy system, which has even less to do with socialism than our system has to do with capitalism. This was combined with nationalist pressures for independence and social pressures attacking the tyrannical system, which by the early 1980s turned into the crisis that has now become the collapse of the Soviet Union.

&gt;All this had little to do with Western policy, but primarily with internal problems and also the general crisis of debt to the West. And there was a crisis of Soviet production, though again not as severe as in the Third World. This is a victory for the West in the Cold War, but that outcome was never seriously in doubt if you look at the relative economic and other forces.

-Noam Chomsky, http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/1991----02.htm

No the widespread use of *capitalism* as an economy led to the collapse as the Russians tried to keep up with their military spending  US/Europe they basically bankrupted themselves. 

If the US and Europe had been using communism or socialism and Russia had been using Capitalism it would've made no difference to the outcome as Russia was still hampered by the fact it had powerful enemies everywhere and few friends on top of a staggering amount of bureaucracy and phenomenal levels of corruption.

Their last ditch effort to spread communism in Afghanistan was seen as a massive failure and the russian people by the late 80s were tired of secret police, being told they can't see western films etc. 

Besides this is all a relatively short time frame (1945 to now). Russia is massively on the rise as they essentially switched to capitalism in the 80s. It's not unreasonable to assume they will be far more developed in 20 years than the UK and possibly the united states as the US is and will be on the decline from this point in history.

The most pure form of capitalism is the US which frankly is seen as a failure across the 1st World countries to Europe, Japan and South Korea having 4 times the homicide rate and more people incarcerated per capita than places like Iran and China.

The most succesful countries on earth at this current time follow a hybrid of socialist-capitalist democracy. 

In short you advertise capitalism like it's the greatest thing in the world yet if we were to follow the US in capitalism our homicide rate would increase by 4 times and our percentage of our GDP spending on health care would double.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;If any of the nationalized industries that were closed had in fact been profitable, private companies would have entered the market to resume operations. Gaps in the market are always closed where potential profit exists.

This is called ideological thinking. Your later comments actually undermine this. Such as this: 

&gt;That's the time period for an industry winding down resistively

Let me explain why. Let us apply Porter's five forces to the strategic state of an industry and you use the standard NPV calculation time scales on project, so 5 years.  There is no guarantee that an industry will go into decline IF you deal with the five force affecting it and the corporations that exist within in effectively.  The idea of ""resistive wind down"" is fallacy, industries can be restructured and rescaled according to need, it just depends which of the five forces you want to tinker with and how much corporation itself is prepared to innovate. 

Thus the idea that if nationalised industry would have been productive then private sector would have waltzed in just ideology. Corporations would only commit to the project if all industry conditions make it useful and strategically sound to be able to carry forward the project.

When I put together projects for investment in Africa the industry's strategic concerns and the possible barriers to entry were what bothered me. Over a five year period would I: be able to lay down a factory, would the local tax regime and the local governance give me stability for five years, what was the competitive environment and crucially what was the local skills base? 

Even now, when I consult for change management project and advise by executive MBAs , the decision to invest or develop within a certain industrial context is based on a five forces analysis and the ability for the company to innovate. 

Where the UK was suffering in the 1970s was lack of innovation and a industrial environment to be able to develop the necessary response to global competition. That industrial environment wasn't just the unions, however, it was many many things. 

Here's the difference, in Germany the industrial relations were different, the skills base was different, the way investment was procured and crucially LOCAL STATE SUPPORT was different.  A company could invest in a place and barrier to entry would be molified by various factors. 

Thatchers' revolution only dealt with the Union and the state structure. It didn't bother with the rest. It didn't re-skill, it didn't restructure the investment environment to encourage local and regional support. 

In fact she helped centralise the banking in London and overpower the London banks. Instead of having local banks that were happy to provide local funding to industry, the local industry suddenly had to compete with investment project all over the world. 

Simply removing the industry and hoping for the magic fairy dust of private industry to take over was never going to work. Even her half hearted attempts at Enterprise Zones were mixed in their success simply because they did not address those critical issues.

The Germany post-unification is not a separate entity, it is a continuation of the Germany that was successful during the 1970s and 1980s. This is worth bearing in mind. Germany's industrial policy , along with its political structure and education system was relatively stable over the period leading up to unification. 

There's a crucial difference in the way Germany also dealt with industrial relations and industrial strategy. All parties worked together as much as possible in order to deliver stability and development. Local banks, local states legislatures and unions were often planning together in how to support local industries. 

Solving the industrial relations issues in the UK was only one part of the story of a whole system , thus just dealing with that on its own would not lead to an immediate uptick in industrial investment. 

Industry will not magically appear because an industry in inherently profitable. Industrial project require a great deal of structure to work, especially heavy long term investments such a industrial plants.

true,throwaway92392,null,null,"Unfortunately a reality which we aren't addressing is the discrimination against young white males. I sat in a major organisation as I overheard two colleagues discussing the recent round of interviews. Two candidates were very similar on the 'scripted' interview. Rather than carry out a second-round unscripted interview, which is more usual, the more senior colleague (a female), who was being asked for advice, first said ""well, what colour are they?"". Both were white so they went for the female. I was too new to feel comfortable speaking up, and before you ask, I was internally promoted because of previous experience and by different people but it did concern me that such things existed and could actually count against me. Also, don't get me wrong, white males did work in this place - of course they did. I'm just saying this discrimination existed. 

A few months later, there was another set of interviews for another position. I knew some of the candidates and they had years of experience in similar roles but all got rejected, instead, a heavily under-experienced asian girl was hired, she was eventually sacked. It was the same people doing the interviewing, I don't have confirmation as I did before but given the previous circumstance, I presume they discriminated. 

I don't doubt for a second that there can be a level of discrimination against ethnic minorities and I want to see that ended, but I don't want that to turn into so called 'positive discrimination' where young white males are just being rejected because of their race/gender. That's just not fair.

I've also encountered it where graduates from top universities - male and female -  are being rejected because it's becoming more fashionable to hire under qualified people because of 'social mobility'. That sounds like a great idea but remember this, not everybody who goes to a top University is a toff or even remotely rich, most are just normal kids who did well at school and now getting into massive debt. Now they're being rejected simply because they worked hard and shouldered that debt, it's unacceptable.

&gt;Now in the Second World of the Soviet Union's dominance, there was also economic collapse... a stagnation of the command economy system, which has even less to do with socialism than our system has to do with capitalism. This was combined with nationalist pressures for independence and social pressures attacking the tyrannical system, which by the early 1980s turned into the crisis that has now become the collapse of the Soviet Union.

&gt;All this had little to do with Western policy, but primarily with internal problems and also the general crisis of debt to the West. And there was a crisis of Soviet production, though again not as severe as in the Third World. This is a victory for the West in the Cold War, but that outcome was never seriously in doubt if you look at the relative economic and other forces.

Would he be a good buy if Bale went the other way? Fuck no.


But why not, Darkest of Knights? We've built our system slowly to support Bale, much like Barcelona support Messi. Bale is allowed to take a 35 yard shot if Defoe is standing onside a yard from goal and no one will say anything to him. Why? Because he pulls goals out of his ass when we need them the most. Higuain is not a player you build your system around. He's only effective when he has one or two other classy players playing WITH him. By himself, he'd be very useless.

I would add: Under no circumstances communicate with the parking company or acknowledge their letters - you have no obligation to provide them anything. Ignore.

Even if there was a contract, where it has been breached the parking company would have to claim for loss only. If it's £2 to park then their loss is £2. Where it's free parking = no loss, they would have nothing to claim.

With regards to council parking, it's a bit trickier because they do have a lawful right to pursue you for the fine, but never forget that councils have to obey the law also, check out this:

http://ticketfighter.co.uk/parking-and-loading/#parkingbays

If a parking restricted road is not correctly marked up with signs (due to incompetence or maintenance failure) then there is no lawful parking restrictions in place. If you get a ticket in such circumstances, always take photos of your car and the signage.

In such a case they will still pursue - even to the adjudicator - but they will lose. When they do lose, report it to the local paper and make as many people aware as possible.

They need to be held to account and obey the law just as much as you and I do.

The UK had massive problems with it's economy and industrial relations(problems that had started around the end of the Empire, and problems that were made dramatically worse by the actions of Attlee and Churchill post WW2), and as a result it had a very narrow range of options open to it.

$1 million to build a factory **This is the top**. The money does not disappear, **This is where it trickles** but rather becomes wages to builders, revenue to suppliers etc. **this how that trickle spreads** The builders will have higher disposable income, and consumption may rise, so that aggregate demand will also rise. ** More trickling** Suppose further that recipients of the new spending by the builder in turn spend their new income, **this how that trickle spreads again** this will raise demand and possibly consumption further, and so on.

Well it is a little silly to debate me when you are actually taking my side but your just a little confused by the fact your economic views going against your political ones. This may scare you enough to run away but that's another problem you need to work on.

Government spending can end the use of the term recession but like I said they could do that by throwing money in a fire burning it will make GDP go up. Money does not magically double yes the money that trickled down will be spent and yes that would make GDP go up but again that is a silly metric of measurement. The government doesn't and can't create wealth. Rich people create wealth and poor people consume it. 

No this economics did not get the world out of the great depression. If you sweep the dirt to a different corner of the room the dirt is still there. The end of the recession in the US anyway was due to the fact they had no competition as Europe was blown to shit. 

The problem here is you think throwing money into fire (or the equivalent) fixes things. It does not. That money needs to be paid back and with interest. The dirt must be cleaned not hidden.

This is cute your so confused. 

Dude I work for the government and I have a masters in economics from Harvard. Questioning me only makes you look stupid. 

Last GDP numbers 2% down to 1.3% down to 0.4%.

Using a bias source and showing your political alignment you don't even really believe.

true,Lyise,null,null,"&gt;The problem is with the state making assumptions with what individuals want to do with their own organs. The idea looks great at first glace, as it will no doubt boost the amount of donors, but what is wrong is the resulting structure of 'You don't own your own body - the state does, until you ask for it back'.

In which case, do you think that a coma patient's treatment should be prohibited until such a time that they are able to consent to the procedure?

On an unrelated note, is it okay that the government demands that children attend some form of education, or is that also an infringement on their rights as an individual? We make concessions on these matters as they are better for the whole, and in the case of organ donation there would always be the option to opt-out (although it would obviously need to be done ahead of time or by someone with power of attorney).

&gt;How about this? Instead of having people's organs harvested when they die, their bodies go into a meat grinder to be fed as dog food for RSPCA kennels? You'd sure as hell get a few dissenters then. But hey, you can just opt-out right? So there's nothing wrong with the government declaring it!

Is there the same risk of loss of life in this situation, does the meat for these animals need to be human meat? As far as I'm aware, neither of these is the case. From what I understand, what the RSPCA lacks is money for treatments and not for food, and the food itself (correct me if I'm wrongly) is barely ever human meat.

We don't currently have the technology (it is in the works) to produce human organs in the lab, and until that time it seems like this would be a sensible solution to help save thousands of lives. Yes, people can opt-in, and they do, but there are many people that could have opted in, but never got around to it and died suddenly.

So there could be 20 or 10 people who get a ""job"" out of this.

The supermarket, obviously wanting to look like a benevolent local employer, would announce as many local jobs as they could, so I'm saying what are they allowed to report as a job? 20 hours, or 10 hours a week?  Or does it have to be FTE jobs that are to be counted.  Ditto for the government.

true,AlanCrowe,null,null,"&gt; All you are saying is that British workers were paid more than Polish or Indian steelworkers, so they had to be sacrificed to market forces.

What strikes me about this sentence is the rhetorical technique. One can express oneself in a *negative* way, denouncing what you object to, or one can express oneself in a *positive*, advocating what you approve of. The sentence is *negative*. It objects to sacrificing Sheffield steel workers to market forces.

This makes me suspicious. What is the positive version, and why was it withheld? If I take the trouble to unpack the meaning of the *negative* version and work out what the *positive* version is, will I like what I find? Do I find that I've been tricked because there a two *positive* formulations and whichever I criticize I'll be told the the Mr_CrashSite actually meant the other?

The big problem is that steel is shipped round the world. Long ago, if Koreans wanted steel, if Malaysians wanted steel, they bought it from Sheffield. It was expensive and provided high wages to Sheffield steel workers (compared to Korea and Malaysia). Time goes by and Korea learns to make steel. They say to Malaysia ""Buy your steel from us, half-price."" The trade secret is secret no more and the good times are over for Sheffield steel.

We can say that Sheffield steel workers have been ""sacrificed to market forces"". Or we can put it in positive terms, saying what we would do to stop Malaysians buying Korean steel. We have a template to work from. During the Raj, Sheffield steel workers didn't have to fear competition from Indian steel works. The colonial power wouldn't allow that. 

Growing up in a right wing British household I used to believe in the Empire and that British rule of India was a *good thing*. Encountering Indians over the internet has sown doubts in my mind. Weren't the Indian's getting ripped off, told to stay out of manufacturing, to keep Britain rich? 

It is clear enough how this template applies to Koreans making steel and selling it to Malaysian's at prices that undermine European profits and wages. We should send the Royal Navy round to Korea and shell their steel works. Once the steel works are smoking ruins, Malaysia will be obliged to buy steel from Sheffield at full price and Sheffield jobs and wages will be safe. And it is easy to justify, at least to the 19 Century mind. Yellow people are inferior and it is a kindness to make them stick to the hill farming and primitive poverty to which they are best suited.

How we advocate racist imperialism depends whether we are on the right or the left. If we are the old-fashioned kind of right winger we can formulate our policy proposals in a positive way. We can't have yellow people stealing white men's jobs and we should use force to prevent it. If we are on the left it is trickier.

We have to advocate using *negative* rhetoric. We dog-whistle by talking about Sheffield steel workers being ""sacrificed to market forces."" and hope that Korean readers and Malaysian readers will not notice that in this case ""market forces"" involve Korean and Malaysia developing economically and not accepting the inferior position allocated to them by white men.",0,1365682847,null,0,false,0,c9cz6h8,t3_1c35vq,t1_c9cz6h8,t1_c9cm9zf,null,1431596105,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,zombie_dave,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; This is called ideological thinking

Perhaps. Does this therefore imply a statement is true or false though? No, it doesn't. That's determined by the content.

&gt; Porter's five forces

Aha! I spy an ideology... ;-)

&gt; Corporations would only commit to the project if all industry conditions make it useful and strategically sound to be able to carry forward the project.

Yes, I agree completely. I used profit to illustrate the point, you chose a more detailed and wordy model. We're talking about the same thing though.

&gt; Thatchers' revolution only dealt with the Union and the state structure. It didn't bother with the rest. It didn't re-skill, it didn't restructure the investment environment to encourage local and regional support. 

And here's where we plainly disagree. 

Your implication appears to be that it's up to government (local or national) to sort out the mess. That's only defensible to taxpayers if there's something worth salvaging. In the case of the steel mills and coal mines the cost/benefit analysis was done, not to mention plenty of subjective analysis on the effect to the communities concerned. Ultimately the numbers were crunched and the results showed a great big 'nope'.

&gt; In fact she helped centralise the banking in London and overpower the London banks. Instead of having local banks that were happy to provide local funding to industry,

This is just wrong. London's banks already provided (and still provide) very different financial services to the sort needed by small and medium sized industries. Thatcher's reforms strengthened Britain's ability to compete in those specific (international) financial markets. It was not to the detriment of local commercial banking, which is a wholly different financial sector.

&gt; Simply removing the industry and hoping for the magic fairy dust of private industry to take over was never going to work. 

Nobody (least of all me) said she expected private industry to drop in and replace nationalised ones like for like. That would only have been true if it had made economic sense to do so, and evidently that wasn't the case. 

I think this is where Thatcher's detractors struggle to see the bigger picture. It's a local tragedy for a community if the only source of jobs gets taken away, but if that source is only feasible with the life support of national coffers then it ultimately shouldn't be there in the first place. Harsh, yes, but still true. Constant manipulation and intervention by the state just delays and magnifies small corrections to creates a larger one later. This was the reason the effects were so profoundly felt when she made the call to cut off that life support. It sucks, but the alternative would have been to peel off the state-sponsored band-aid slowly (and painfully) instead of ripping it off in one short, sharp motion.

&gt; Even her half hearted attempts at Enterprise Zones were mixed in their success simply because they did not address those critical issues

Fair comment.

No one is asking anyone to forget anything, what is being asked is that people realise that thatcher did what she had to do and the true organizations at fault here are the pre Thatcher governments and the trade unions themselves.

The trade unions chose a path of non-engagement. They chose to prevent a negotiated settlement which could have resulted in an economic transition primarily because of their ideology. So in essence the mining industry was captured by an anti-capitalist cabal who demonized the capitalist class.

Otherwise, I don't know what Levy thinks.  I'm assuming that the last few years of success would make him think that whatever our outcome this season will not be unacceptable.  Even if we slipped to 5th or 6th, Levy would hopefully not be in the Abramovich mindset that immediate results don't make up for possible future results.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt;But there is another way. Germany has a sound industrial base and is the strongest economy in Europe. How come? 1) Government investment in education for all (not just the top 50%) so they have a skilled workforce at every level. 2) Investment in industrial research and development through tax relief 3) A culture which doesn't seek profits at all costs. 4) A co-operative, and mutually respectful attitude between management and labour. 5) a high wage economy with generaous contributory benefits.

1) Germans have fewer people going to university than we do.  The mistake we made, which pre-dates the 80s was to not allow streaming.  Grammar schools were not a great solution, but they appear to be for Germany at least a better solution.  In Germany Vocational Training isn't the dirty word it is in England. 

I think by having an education system which drags everyone down to equality, we fail to invest in children.  I am biased on this point as I was excluded at 13 due to been a bit of a hellraiser, a dyslexic who was un-diagnosed, I did better on my own, than I did in school, returning to education at 6th form and uni.  I am an outlier with a *non-average* mind.  In our current education system that makes you something of a perior, until segregation kicks in with 6th form and uni.

We fail children not because of a lack of money, we fail children because we treat them as if they are the same.  Children below average struggle and will never really achieve as much as someone who is average, those above get the best years of their life wasted.

If we had more emphasis on individualism, like the german education system has, opportunities for people who are very visual and hands on to do things that click with their minds better, we would have a much better workforce.

2) The way the germans invest in research isn't much different to us, it is divvied up by a research council based on merit or just pure nepotism.  Is there something I'm missing, I haven't ever heard about this, but I did only live there for a few years.

3) That isn't true at all.  Germans are ruthless in their efficiency of running large companies, or rather the ones I've worked for have been.  If your role is redundant due to change in demand or automation, you don't have that role, period.  It is more the opposite of what the nationalised industries used to be like in the UK.  However I have found that German companies I've worked for tend to retain staff more, acknowledging the cost benefit of not having to find/hire.  They are entirely neo-libralisist in their principles, even the East Germany ones.

4) This is very true, when the management agreed something with the unions it was agreed for a long time.  It's very hard to compare two historic companies even if they're in the same country, for their union and management interactions.  But it is fair to say that the germans were not on strike anything like as much as the brits were.  It is true that inflation was really hurting people in these industries in Britain but during reunification was also really impacting the lives of the west Germans negatively, there still is plenty of racism towards them in some sleepy areas.  However the workers took it on the chin so to speak.  It's hard to find any credible data on the number of strikes per industry per year per country.  But definately by international perception, the press and things Britain didn't look like a good place to invest in for workers.

5) Totally disagree, GDP per capita was higher than Germany.  This was the problem, people weren't wanting to be part of the team that combated inflation.  People didn't want jobs to go because of mechanisation.

You mention Germany as an example, but then describe individualism as if its something which is failing.  I find it odd because every form of collectivism I think fails for the same reason, people aren't as nice as they like to think they are.  I got drunk with an old friend last night.  About £30 gone, I didn't get any good sleep (I never do when I drink) and I am been much less productive today, than I am on average.  I paid £30 to make me fat, damage my insides and feel bad.  There are people in this world who die for want of clean water and I choose to allocate resources on harming myself, rather than helping them.  We have these emotional needs, with emotional re-enforcements, some we can master, some we just lie about.

The classic for me is Vietnam, I am lucky to have made some good friends who give me food and board, a little bit of language class whilst letting me write in piece.  It is an odd place as it is still in flux, the move to collectivised farming failed, people paid with their lives.  A lot of people.  Yet, the transition to individualism has seen amazing changes, from having to import rice too feed people, it now exports, a lot of it.  The exact same land, being tended by the exact same families yield more crops.  This is not due to fancy nitrates, the USSR had been giving them those before.  It is a simple thing.  Have you ever worked in a paddy field?  I'm 196cm, so maybe it's worse for me, but its torment.  The heat, the humidity, the disease and I was only there to take a photo!  I can't imagine someone in front of the field thinking *hmm, I must figure out a way to yield more* after a hard days work.  Frankly I don't think it is particularly fair to expect them too.

How could the ruling party tell which farmers were lazy, which had bad land, which had bad weather, which had diseases. 

They couldn't.

How hard would you work a day?  Most people do a kind of linear optimisation the minimum amount for the lifestyle they want, for the work available too them.  Someone who is already yeilding enough rice to feed 50 people from their 10 man family would probably think that is enough work.  Their hands are cut, their back is aching, who wouldn't say it is!

Obviously when they became the ones who profited, the exact same farmers, with the same land, the same tools, the same techniques yeilded more.  People also cared about learning more, my friend fondly remembers the day his extended family put in a form of irrigation.  This was something they made themselves, designed themselves, just because the desire to have some selfish luxury allowed them to ignore the blood, the back breaking physical pain, the fatigue and the exhaustion.",0,1365687194,null,0,false,0,c9d05dv,t3_1c35vq,t1_c9d05dv,t1_c9cm9zf,null,1431595648,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Thatcher should be respected for her ability to overcome the obstacles she faced and in that regard she was remarkable but the fact is she never really did anything to remove those obstacles for those who came after. I've often heard it put as she broke through the glass ceiling and pulled the ladder up after herself.

Mine, and a lot of peoples issue, with your point of view is that being proof that a women can achieve is not a victory for equality if it requires women to be more, be better, work harder than men. In terms of movement for equality achieving and then not seeking change to address the inequality when she was in unique position to do so may not have hurt but is arguably an unforgivable missed opportunity to advance them. I personally don't subscribe to the idea that this equates directly to hurt but a lot of people understandably do. 

If you didn't see Thatcher hold back the campaign for women's rights can I ask you if you ever saw her actively help it? If she didn't can I ask you why you think she didn't? At a time in which she was attempting to drastically reshape society she seemingly never took steps to make it more fair to women which, frankly, just seems at odds with this idea that she is the paragon of womens rights you say she is.

If some mugged and attacked a person who turned out to be gay, they wouldn't be charged under a hate crime.

If they attacked someone shouting how he was going to ""Attack the [Insert your preferred homophobic slurs here]"" and was using homophobic epithets during the whole attack, then it would be a hate crime.

Same with the sub-cultures, if the attacker is shouting slurs about a person and attacking the person because of it, be it race, gender, gender identity, sub-culture, sexual orientation, anything, they should be punished more... or have no policy of a hate crime make things equal.

The reason Hate Crimes in general are punished more is as I have seen commented here before is that if a person is attacked for non-hate crime reasons, i.e. is mugged randomly/fight in a bar etc, then though it is a bad thing its not a targeted crime. If a crime is directed at a particular group (I.e. Race, Orientation etc) it affects that community, making them feel more unsafe and targeted.

In fact I just had a glimpse inside this dudes mind and perhaps see why he might not enjoy night life.

The whole thing reeks of London snobbery to be honest from some dickhead in a cupboard sized bedroom in shoreditch who dreams of being the next Brett Easton Ellis but only has 1/100th of the talent. Some people don't want to create the next grime/dubstep scene and just want a night out with some mates after a long week at work.

David won the MP vote 17.8% to 15.5%, the party member vote 18.1% to 15.2%, but lost narrowly overall because the unions went against him 19.95% to 13.4%. Essentially, everybody was comfortably in favour of David except for the unions.

Besides the issue that unions can effectively double vote for their membership (who can also be party members), this mechanism basically means that they've got a leader who is too far left/too uncharismatic for most Labour MPs and party members. I struggle to believe that he'll fare any better against the general electorate. It was, in my opinion, an incredibly short sighted move by the unions to strengthen their connections to Labour, jeopardising the party's prospects to actually get into power.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;Aha! I spy an ideology... ;-) - 

No Porter - is an economist, and a strategist.

&gt;Yes, I agree completely. I used profit to illustrate the point, you chose a more detailed and wordy model. 

Nope, you don't actually understand Porter if you consider it a wordy model. ""Profit"" is not the same an strategic vision. It's one of the components and even the it's called economic performance , not necessarily a ""Profit"". This is why a lot of firms use Porter because they can balance economic against sustainability, industry conditions, etc. An investment will not be a purely economic consideration, it will also feature decision making based around long term planning and vision. 

(P.S. I don't actually like Porter, I teach his stuff because he is the industry standard and most companies use him, if not all. In the 1980s he was the guru for the HBR and LBS types in management consultancies  -so his ideas were the ones being used at the time by actual industry). 

&gt;Your implication appears to be that it's up to government (local or national) to sort out the mess. That's only defensible to taxpayers if there's something worth salvaging. In the case of the steel mills and coal mines the cost/benefit analysis was done, not to mention plenty of subjective analysis on the effect to the communities concerned. Ultimately the numbers were crunched and the results showed a great big 'nope'. 

It is up to government, the government creates the external environment for industry to operate in. It provides the context within which investment decisions work. Isn't this the whole rationale behind tax cuts and reducing statutory wage costs? 

You can't have it both ways, either you have no government involvement or you have it. If you have government involvement then government has a duty to foster and curate the conditions for economic development. 

This is doubly so when the asset government is disposing of is owned by the government itself. If the assets are private that the responsibility of the government is to mange to external engagement of the corporation. This was not the case with those industries. 

Lastly, stories like Renault and other manufacturers in Europe , with more restrictive business environments show that it was possible to plan out futures for these organisation if the will had existed to make a difference. The ""nothing could be done"" line is something I come across too many times in change management programmes and usually find that something can always be done - it depends what the goal is. The French government and the German governments were't trying to break the unions as an ideological imperative and the German Unions were able to work with their local political class thus could afford to restructure, manage, innovate and stabilise. 

&gt;This is just wrong. London's banks already provided (and still provide) very different financial services to the sort needed by small and medium sized industries. Thatcher's reforms strengthened Britain's ability to compete in those specific (international) financial markets. It was not to the detriment of local commercial banking, which is a wholly different financial sector.

I don't think you understand how project finance works and how it's raised, especially for large scale industrial projects. This is a problem that's existed in the UK for a while, and was in place before Thatcher. For large scale projects, things like heavy industry or capital projects, the finance was always raised in London. Local banks and building societies dealt with small to medium businesses but when faced with large project even they were forced to seek funds on the London market. 

This wouldn't be a problem if the London market serves the UK, but the London market has always been the hub for international finance, so you project finance is now exposed to market rates and qualifying criteria that apply to the world. The advantage is that you can access money much more diverse sources - the downside is that you're competing with the best projects in the world for that money. 

Now here is where it hurts. Let's say you're running a smelting plant that requires upgrades, you seek the finance and the finance isn't forthcoming because the ROI you need becomes a lot more harder to achieve. 

In places like Germany they got round that in two ways, local banks were able to step in and provide some of the finance, or back it themselves or the local government + federal government would then work together to either reduce the risk and make the ROI feasible or provide bridge funding. 

What we should have done is set up similar mechanism as we stepped down the goverment investment. We should have provided local mechanisms where councils and gov did this as a rule. What happened was that we not only cut the investments in these industries, we then failed to provide the structure that other places had and release the full force of the international markets on everything and anything. 

No one else did that. Not even the Americans where copious amounts of Federal and State contracts, subsidies and pork barrel projects kept much of Motown on Life support while they restructured.

Speaking as a Goth and a woman I can tell you this:

I have been attacked purely based on the clothes I wear. I have been seriously injured from attacks. I've had people, who otherwise would be considered good neighbours to other, throw Macdonalds' milkshakes at my head in a crowded town centre.

My brother is a metaler, he too has been attacked for how he dresses. He was mugged at a cash machine once; his attackers approached him from behind and stole his money, when they saw him from the front they returned to beat on him and stomp on his knee. He required two operations to correct the damage.

I've had friends beaten and seriously injured who were singled out in a crowd of, frankly, much weaker targets, based on their subculture.

As a teenager I was chased by *grown men* with cricket bats shouting things like, ""goth scum"". When I frantically called the police they responded with, ""We'll be there in 30 mins"".

None of these offences have ever been prosecuted. Most of the time the apathy of the police was akin to that of our attackers; many thought we deserved it. The closest to prosecution was when my brother was mugged. There were several witnesses who refused to testify, including a taxi driver who stated, ""if he didn't want to be attacked he shouldn't have dressed that way.""

From the perspective of where I sit these things happen regularly and no one else seems to care. We are a subculture that is targeted, and unless you've been a part of that subculture you probably won't have witnessed some of the truly horrendous things that happen to people of my ilk.

If classifying and recording attacks on a subculture like mine will lead the police to take them more seriously then I am grateful that people are finally noticing that its not ok to harm someone based on how they dress.

true,Mr_CrashSite,null,null,"Thank you for your long critique. It really made me think. I wrote the piece originally as a personal sort of therapy, because Margaret Thatcher dominated my political thinking for such a long time. And not in a good way. She first challenged and then seemed to set out to annihilate everything I believed in and seemed to get a good proportion of the country to agree with her. I have been depressed politically pretty much ever since. New Labour under Blair was just the icing on the poisonous cake. So forgive the lack of sources to back up what I said. Most of what I came to understand about 'Thatcherism'  came from the group of sociologists around Professor Stuart Hall, first at Birmingham and then at the Open University. Marxism Today was the journal in the eighties which tried to track the development of the new brand of radical Conservatism Thatcher came to represent. I've come to see this politics as springing from the same root as the Tea Party movement in the US Republican Party. But that's another story.

 I have a problem with the idea of bias. I am presenting a very well-known position from the 'Left' of the political spectrum, but my interpretation of Margaret Thatcher's political leadership strikes you as unbalanced and therefore without merit. This begs the question of what a  'balanced' point of view might look like. This is the BBC way of thinking: let's get someone to interview with a certain point of view, and then 'balance' their ideas with someone who disagrees. There are many points of view, two voices rarely begin to cover the question. For example, we very rarely get a socialist position expressed at any length (Channel 4 News got Alexei Sayle, a comic writer, to be  unhelpfully rude about Thatcher on the evening of her death). His parents were Liverpudlian Communists (not many of those around now), and at one point, Sayle shouted out 'Marxism' just to hear the word mentioned  on mainstream TV, which was a bit silly. So when you use the word balance, I immediately think of the bias in the media, because it means talking about an incredible narrow set of 'approved' opinions. I think the news media control the debate and why blogs like this are so important. And this is not just my opinion. For example, regarding the way Thatcher handled the miners' strike over the fifteen months it lasted, you could look at the work of The Glasgow Media Group at the university, who analysed the whole of the strike through the representations in news media. Their findings were incontrovertible: extreme  'bias' against 'strikers' (always a bad thing), ' picket line violence' (the context of strike breakers paid by management was rarely seen as a context), and against strikers' 'unreasonable' demands causing a threat to social order (this is where Thatcher's unforgivable comment on miners being the 'enemy within' came from.) They use endless pieces of media evidence to back up their findings. 
 A problem with the lack of non-mainstream ideas in circulation is that young people who weren't around at the time rarely get to hear of them, unless their parents are interested (like yours) or they study particular subjects like Sociology, Politics (at least in the UK), or possibly a certain kind of radical history. Or perhaps you went and talked to the 'Occupy' protesters outside St Pauls. They were trying to educate themselves and anyone who was prepared to listen, why they believed that the Government's policy towards the banking crash, and the generally out-of-control global financial sector, and the consequent recession, was only protecting the 1% (more accurately the 0.01%) at the expense of the 99%. Another source of alternative thinking is coming from the policy groups that Miliband has set up within the Labour Party.

Even if we finish fifth I think AVB has done a great job, the media hasn't accurately represented just how difficult a time he's had and how much the the team has fundamentally been forced into change from last season. Lost two of our three best players in VDV and Modric, lost King who was still important for us last season, been missing Kaboul for more or less the whole season and Assou Ekotto and Sandro for significant portions of it too, whilst blooding in new players like Dembele, Vertonghen and Lloris, and having to deal with Adebayor and Defoe's loss of form. 

All this, when we never actually really sorted the areas that badly needed addressing in the squad. Had we actually signed Moutinho and a striker, I think we'd be in a substantially better position, and yet AVB has been nothing but utterly professional and positive about Levy's efforts to make signings. 

Hopefully Levy knows he's onto a good thing with AVB, and Andre will be with us for a long time.

Well, yes I do kind of agree with you, but I disagree on the relevance.

I think that it's the job of a politician to enact what the people want. The people wanted devolution for Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, London and the people wanted the Freedom of Information Act and people wanted the Good Friday Agreement: So Blair gave it to them. It'd be odd if he didn't. That's how democracies are supposed to work. People wanted those things, Blair said he;d give them those things, so people voted for Blair. If some one called Smith had offered the same things, and Blair was absent, they would have voted for Smith. 

So it would be odd if Blair hadn't have done those things. I'm not really sure you can criticise him for doing what was in the public will when other major parties weren't going to. Furthermore, if Blair had done other *surprising/unsuspected* things that the public **didn't** want, wouldn't it have been kind of odd? I mean, I could very much argue that what Thatcher did would have happened anyway (though personally I think it could have taken a long time). The trade unions were very powerful and the public was very displeased with them what with power outages and things. I think Thatcher did thinks a little more uniquely than Blair did what he did, but I think they're both guilty of what you described, and there's not *that much* to separate them.",0,1365693172,null,0,false,0,c9d22q1,t3_1c4lxr,t1_c9d22q1,t1_c9d16oe,null,1431594669,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,Xuth,eng-lancashire,Southener in the North,"I went to Sheffield University and found that it's just as much the other way around, and it depends on the course and country of origin that we're talking about. (Pardon for the generalisations but it lines up with what I observed in my 3 years there).

In my course there were several Scandinavians, and other Europeans, a Brazilian and a few Chinese. The Scandinavians, Europeans and Brazilian integrated with everyone else without barriers - we often just forgot that they were actually foreign. But the Chinese tended to stay with their own community (Sheffield has a very large Chinese population by virtue of the Universities). 

If you then look at the popular courses for foreign students (Engineering, Sciences etc) you see even more barriers between the different ethnic groups. The Chinese especially would tend to keep to their own - shop in their own supermarkets, stay at student accommodation where they all knew the majority of the others were (often private accommodation rather than the large student villages). 

The other part of the problem is the massive cultural gap. Another sweeping generalisation here, but us Brits and other Euros tend to be big on going out and drinking at Uni. Almost every activity at the student's union involves some kind of drink. And lots of it. Whereas the drinking culture just isn't a part of the lives of people coming in from China and other countries. The social activities just never align and everyone just keeps to what they know. I was always friendly with the Chinese students on my course, and chatted to them often - but outside of my faculties department we just didn't have enough in common to engage in a friendship of mutual activities. 

I have to admit that it's a case that it was always us and them. They existed in their half of the student experience and we existed in ours. Similar cultures tend to attract. ",0,1365694200,null,0,false,0,c9d2g7c,t3_1c4yjd,t1_c9d2g7c,t3_1c4yjd,null,1431594493,20,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,20

But I wasn't talking so much about actual people, as much as the constituency Margaret Thatcher constructed for her own political purposes. If you talk about the nice respectable group, you immediately put into people's minds those that aren't: the people who are welfare dependent (like the many working poor), the un-thrifty (who are so poor they have to take a loan out for 4000% to get a child a pair of shoes) , or the ones who use a bit of money they shouldn't on their cellphone? You've fallen into that trap yourself. Who are these overeducated layabouts? (Not heard that one before.) Thatcher's way of talking, ever so subtly, generates anti-social hatred.
Thatcher didn't even have to describe the 'other' in any detail - they just hover in the background, the people who are not like us. Have you noticed how Cameron is using the same method, but more explicitly: we now have the  'shirkers' vs the 'strivers' to justify his benefit cuts. Both politicians are making distinctions between the deserving and the undeserving to justify policies that will really hurt the largest unloved minority of all - the poor.  From the left side of politics, it's called divide and rule; get different parts of the workforce to hate each other (whether it's on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender or work status), so that they don't notice that most middling sort of people like them haven't increased their standard of living for years. Meanwhile the top 40% (or is it the top 10%? top 1%? top 0.1%?) have done much better, or very, very much better. From the Left's position, it seems incredible that no-one seems to notice, let alone care about, the downward shift in the proportion of GDP going to pay ordinary wages, and the dramatic upward shift in payments given as profits and in the eye-watering overpayment of top managers, over the last thirty years.

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;Like I said, she actively helped women's rights by asserting her own rights to follow a career path which had previously been reserved for men ... and helping other women by supporting laws which advanced their rights, such as legalising abortion

Ok let's go into detail shall we. Firstly as an aside I want to address something, she wasn't the first women in politics or to have politics as a career. You are making it sound as if she was the only woman ever to follow that route when it's more fair to say she was successful. I'm not attempt to dismiss that achievement just recognise others like Lady Astor (first female MP), Constance Markievicz (first female elected to our parliament and the first female cabinet member in the world for the Irish Republic ) or the Duchess of Atholl (first female to be a member of a conservative government) to name a few very early examples.  Oddly enough I think Thatcher is quoted as calling pilarmet ""a dreadfully male-dominated place"" at an event in relation to Astor, she also actually made an awful lot of speeches in terms of equality before being PM but as you so neatly put it ""Actions speak louder than words"" and her actions and both her words changed once she was in power.  

You're right that Thatcher did vote in favour of abortion (and decrimlising homesexuality) but as far as I'm aware she never introduce any woman's rights legislation, but I might be wrong there in terms of a equal pay in the army thing but I can't seem to dig up the details. Anyway once in power this was something she had to say on womens rights.

&gt;The battle for women's rights has been largely won. The days when they were demanded and discussed in strident tones should be gone forever. And I hope they are.

How could she be seen to fight for something that was already won? Which is really the answer to the following

&gt;How exactly did she ''break through the glass ceiling and pull the ladder up after herself''? what does that mean in practical terms: how exactly did she take advantage of women's new found rights and then revoke those rights for other women?

To women who still see politics and society as unequal Thacher represents some one who broke the mold but did nothing to form a new one. She hardly promoted women in government, only one past any kind of junior level and as far as I'm aware it wasn't because of a lack of talent. She didn't introduce a move to bring more women into politics or to tackle the kind of sexism that existed before during and still after her period in charge.

We sell Ade to the LA Galaxy for £18 mil because AEG thought the deal was in American dollars. He gets a ticket for talking on his cell phone in the car within the first few days of being in SoCal. 

We then sign Kolbeinn Sigthorsson for £5 mil from Ajax. SuperJan is delighted and we add another cool duo nickname. Sig-Sig. 

ManU signs Drogba after paying a £5 mil transfer fee and Javier Hernandez tells Fergie that he wants out ASAP. Dan the Man decides to make a move on him and we agree to a transfer which includes £15 mil and gift card to Taco Bell.

We then finish up by selling Dempsey to Ajax at a discounted rate of £9 mil. We include a thank you note and a box of chocolates for being so kind to us.

true,military_history,cnty-england,Dorset/Kent,"I lived with two Chinese students last year. One was very friendly and eager to socialise, in spite of the culture/language hurdles. We had some good times and still go out from time to time. The other made absolutely no attempt to communicate. You could talk to him and at most you'd get a grunt in response. Both had a relatively poor grasp of English when they arrived but while the first improved a lot because he was willing to talk, it remained near-impossible to communicate with the other because he made no attempt to improve his English. I only ever saw him in passing, and the only time he ever went out was with other Chinese students.

There were certain cultural differences as well. The Chinese guys were very messy, never cleaned the kitchen up after themselves (they clogged up the sink pouring food down it at one point) and didn't have a problem with inviting a large group of friends round for dinner and monopolising the kitchen for hours without telling anyone else in advance. One guy allowed a homeless friend to sleep on his floor for several months. And they used the language barrier as an excuse to feign ignorance if anyone asked them to clean up their mess. But these were annoyances, not something which prevented us socialising.

A lot of the problem lies with the unwillingness of foreign students to make an effort to fit in. I can't claim that the us British guys were completely welcoming, or avoided making any generalisations about them, and I understand that travelling thousands of miles to a foreign country is difficult, and if I went to China, the first thing I'd probably do would be to find people I had more in common with. But the fact is that anyone who was willing to be friendly had no problem at all getting along with any other student, regardless of where they were from. Claiming that prejudice prevents students making friends ignores the fact that such problems are often caused when people fail to make an effort to be friendly in the first place.",0,1365696218,null,0,false,0,c9d37g4,t3_1c4yjd,t1_c9d37g4,t3_1c4yjd,null,1431594136,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

You then use your talents with words, which in another life might have been used to write novels or poetry, and regurgitate the negative experience as if you had no control over it, or were doing something important by being there. People read it, accept it as true, and you have just made the world a *slightly* worse place, filled column inches in your boss' magazine, probably exploited some people who just thought you were going to write a nice article about them, and collected your money.

My parents are pretty syncretic in their views, they voted conservative because they are more fiscally conservative, and wouldn't have seen much wrong with Conservatives policies. Up until the age of about 15/16 I followed this loosely. I was never a massive discusser of politics at that point, but I was aware of what was going on and followed it from a more objective point of view.

It was only when I got into Sixth Form and people started studying politics, that I actually had to form an opinion I can logically follow to defend my poisiton. My school was an independent school but by the time I went to leave for University I was left wing, even with a surrounding precense of Tory supporters.

At University my opinion has gone further left, but I am also a huge liberal when it comes to social policy.

true,zombie_dave,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; No Porter - is an economist, and a strategist.

If you check back you'll see I was glibly quoting your reference to his five forces model, not the man himself. Like every other theoretical model, and regardless of his credentials, it is an ideology.

&gt; you don't actually understand Porter if you consider it a wordy model

Wordier than the crude 'profit' model I chose to keep my response brief and accessible to readers without a background in strategic management theory. Of course neither is adequate for truly describing reality, but that's models for you.

&gt; You can't have it both ways, either you have no government involvement or you have it. If you have government involvement then government has a duty to foster and curate the conditions for economic development

Thatcher inherited ""government involvement"" in the form of artificial subsidisation. Her ""government involvement"" was to whip the crutches away, which relieved the government of any curation obligations to provably unsustainable endeavours. See? You *can* have it both ways.

Re: French, German unions: precisely. Thatcher did not have the luxury of functional and productive cooperation but she needed a way forward. Instead of wasting time on demonstrably futile and toxic negotiations she took the other path, which was to destroy them instead.

Re: London financial markets: international competition was exactly the reason London's market needed deregulation at the time. The resulting explosion of new trading instruments and liquidity pools happened in less than a decade. Of course we're now seeing the other side of that coin...

ROI is the life force of money. It naturally flows to the greatest returns. To try to alter its course defeats its true purpose. If a smelting plant can't afford upgrades because projected returns are unattractive then that's too bad, but diverting taxpayer funds to bail out private enterprise is not the solution. As the pits and mills discovered, it creates dependencies that become ever harder to wean off.

&gt; P.S - a hint, I'd roll that back about the bigger picture ;) 

That was a scattershot remark. Clearly you have done your homework. Consider it rolled back out of respect.

Anyway, thanks for an interesting discussion. I'm based in Japan where it's 1:45am so you won't hear another peep out of me.

The writer seems to know a good deal about music and I've read his other music articles. He's coming from the same position I'm coming from although he's being a bit more than a dick about it. And that is that real clubs that play real music are being pushed out in favour of tacky haunts with shite music appealing to superficial people who want to 'be seen' rather than really be into the music and be in a place with other people that love the music as well. 

I guess it might be a bit snobby when I talk about music like that but that's how i feel. I've been an avid House/Techno collector for years and I've been to places where other people are knowledgable about music and they have a passion for it. A proper club consists of a large Dancefloor, a good sound system, good lighting, a DJ and crowd. All the fancy decor and VIP sections take away from the reasons why you're supposed to be there, to dance to music that you thoroughly enjoy with other people.

I'm sure people have been to those clubs where there's a set of dick heads roaming the club looking for trouble or some posers sat in the VIP section with too much fake tan and bling. Clubs are not about that, they're about making the connection between people and the music which brings everyone together.

For example, it might be argued that it is implied in the contract you have with him (money for driving lessons) that you would not be liable for accidental damage or wear to the car providing you were not unreasonably reckless. This might be implied because learner drivers would be more likely to damage the car, and if they do damage the car, it could be partially the instructor's fault for not training you properly.

Thanks for taking time to reply to my comment. When I read your original piece I didn't think that we would have anything in common. However I have to say that I am in full agreement that there is a very narrow range of opinions and viewpoints expressed in the media . I get the impression that much of the news is there to condition public opinion rather that to inform on all the facts. There is still good journalism but it's often tucked away in lengthy articles or late night ""heavyweight"" news programs like Newsnight. Even heavyweight news rarely covers all the viable angles. I've personally taken to watching Russia Today to get an alternative viewpoint on international news. 

As for the concept of bias I understand what you are saying about there being many angles on an issue and more than just two sides.  I could think of dozens of ways of covering the miners strikes from the politics, the cold harsh economics, through the effects on whole communities, families not just the miners themselves.
Getting the whole picture would really have to involve lots of people and that isn't feasible. BUT at least we can try to give a better and more complete picture  by getting views from the main/dominant sides and putting those views forward. Two sides of a story is usually more illuminating than one. 


I think when people thought a sociologist was going to speak we were going to hear about both the people who loved and and the people who loathed MTs substantial changes to British political and economic life. To hear only from someone who dislikes MT was somewhat disappointing. I would really have loved a detached, researched sociological overview of the changes she made on society. There were winners and losers and we saw the decline in unions and socialism and a rise of a more individualistic  ideology amongst some. I think perhaps my expectations and hopes were piqued when I read you were a sociologist.  You're perfectly entitled to a critique of MT, it's just that I think a lot of people were expecting a more detached sociological essay rather than a passionate political essay. 

With regards to radical ideas I'm not of the left or the right, I think the old ideological separations could be holding back meaning political discourse where pragmatism, understanding and policy experimentation may be better.  The only radical political ideology I have seen rise in recent times is the spread of libertarianism in america ( I'm sorry but Occupy for me had no positive leading ideology instead choosing to highlight not liking what was happening ) . I suspect that people like the idea of libitareamism more than the realities of cuts in government help ( much of this new wave of libertarianism is american and ignores the fact that government got bigger in response to peoples demand government action ) 



On political opinions in Britain. Modern elections in britain seem to be won on the center ground - or peoples perception of it - so it's a very important area. Blair may have been a master of occupying the middle ground but it always seemed like a focus group inspired convenience tailored for elections . MT ,people say, moved the middle ground in britain. However biased the mainstream media seems to be there doesn't seem to be an appetite for hard left or hard right view points. The socialist worker paper is for sale in my local newsagent and there are plenty of left wing blogs but the appetite amongst the majority is not there. Either the arguments have not reached the majority or those ideas have been rejected.  It's always difficult to tell how much of ""societal opinion""/""center ground thinking"" is the result of the different sides winning their argument and how much of it is to do with media bias. My experience is that it's a mistake to underestimate the depth and breadth of peoples political perspective or their appetite political thought. Even if popular culture may make you think otherwise.

Even if there simply were no women of merit Thatcher did not seek to do anything to bring more women of merit in to politics. She's often quoted as saying she brought something no other prime ministers had, knowledge only a women has or that a woman who runs a home is closer to understanding the problems of running a country and yet never sought to expand the influence of that view in politics. 

Thatcher, in short, was in a place to bring more women into politics and make sure they were promotes on their merits rather than being held down because of their gender. She did next to little and nothing on that front, claimed womens rights was an all but done issue and disparaged the feminist movement while claiming womens lib hadn't done anything to help her.

There's lots of things you can argue against that however, so I think I need to read a bit more about it.

Possible flaws that spring to mind are:

* the 2% reduction in basic rate (i.e. 8% of tax burden) seems like it could account for half of the reduction in income tax paid by the bottom 50%
* how did the value of tax receipt in real terms change in each of those categories? Does displaying it in percentage terms obscure anything?
* proportion paid by the top 1% was already increasing as early as 1986, so is for example deregulation of the financial industry better correlated with these figures than this budgetary change?
* if we were already starting to see a relative reduction of wages in the low end while high end wages increase due to globalisation etc, then this is exactly what we would expect to see happen to tax receipts, more or less independent of the level of income tax levied.

You don't see a lot of idealism except in the young, and there are good reasons for that. Your mind opens up, and you learn to appreciate subtleties. Idealism is the close-mindedness of inexperience.

Also, you'll have found yourself forced to make decisions which benefit a lot of people but disadvantage a few. It's not a nice thing, but it's all part of the process.

As the EU expands, eastern European countries such as Poland are allowed in to the club, and the citizens get the right to live/move freely/work across the EU. So there is no way to limit immigration in to the UK from these places.

There was an influx of workers, and the perception was that they could (and would) undercut British workers, stereotypically in building, plumbing, etc. There was also the stereotype that they'd get the job done twice as good in half the time.

Add in the usual immigrants-having-babies-on-our-NHS-and-renting-all-our-houses.

Then there's the criminal element - the perception being that various mafias and gypsies would have rich pickings (and yes I have seen more Eastern European beggars around). THEN we go in to the whole fishing culture thing, basically carp is a damn fine meat to them (is this a Catholic thing perhaps??) and ""they"" see no reason not to fish for it.

I copy/pasted and googled that.  Then I read the first page results.  Every single ""study"" was more like an unsourced essay or just opinion research.

&gt;In that case, there are no cultural trends, no matter how blatantly obvious to everyone (but you) until someone has done a comprehensive study on each.

Of course, there are cultural trends (your arguing to absurdity not withstanding).  We could talk about trends all day long.  

But SplashyA (and by extension you) are asserting sexism against women in advertising in general and that it is harming girls and women.  There is a conclusion being drawn that is not necessarily supported. So we can discuss trends and even draw conclusions but without some science to back up conclusions we are essentially making things up.

&gt;Middle-eastern culture isn't biased towards women, etc.

[Plenty of work exist in that field](http://books.google.com/books?id=4Uyypm6T7ZsC&amp;pg=PA590&amp;dq=women+discrimination+arab+world&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CgVnUbCHI_O24AOfyIGwAw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=women%20discrimination%20arab%20world&amp;f=false)  This is a book summarizing all the studies extant in 2005.

&gt;there's really no reason to demonstrate these points to the academic rigor you're demanding for the purposes of a simple Internet discussion.

But the internet makes it easy to point someone toward a source.  It only took me a couple minutes to find this book on the middle east.  

You and SplashyA are making assertions and then saying that you should not need to back them up. 

If I claimed there was discrimination against men on TV shows and advertising because it showed so many violent men and it is harming boys and young men who grow up watching this; you would expect me to show something supporting that assertion.  When the crazy men's rights guys come flooding in to support that assertion you would not take them at their word.

If there is a trend and it is harming someone there will be studies on it.  Heck, if someone can show a casual link they will publish.

**Warning boring numbers ahead:**

Obviously London has to be one of the cities. It has a population of 8 million people on its own, and that's without counting the rest of the Home Counties.

Birmingham isn't only Birmingham. I'm counting that as an audition for the West Midlands, Leicestershire, Warwickshire, Northamptonshire, Shropshire and Rutland. Those counties have a population of 5.2 million people, only 100,000 fewer than the whole of Scotland.

Manchester is the audition for Manchester, Cheshire, Merseyside, Lancashire, Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, Durham and Cumbria. That's 13.2 million people, easily more than twice Scotland.

For the Cardiff audition I'm going to consider Cardiff, Swansea, Newport, Bristol, Somerset, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Devon and Dorset. That's 3.149 million people.

Here's where he *might* have a point. Yeah, maybe they could've had an audition in Edinburgh or Glasgow instead of Cardiff, but if you look at the numbers it's not completely outrageous. And according to Wikipedia, due to the backlash from ignoring Scotland for the first series, they have had an audition in either Glasgow or Edinburgh for all of the following series. This makes Scotland the most over-auditioned part of the UK in Britain's Got Talent (dubious title, I know).

The left needs passionate young blood right now. And if you’re still so very angry about milk being snatched in the 1970s – well, believe me, schoolchildren are starving right now and this ire could be used to get milk reinstated.

true,FlyingTinOpener,k9,K-9,"It didn't bother me. I thought there was a pretty massive implication that the Doctor spent quite a lot of time in ""retirement"" after losing Rory and Amy, and spent quite a bit of time in solitude after 19th century Clara Oswin Oswald's death trying to figure out the mystery around that woman because he was convinced that she's the same Clara as the one from the Dalek asylum.

Also, technically speaking River *is* kind of dead. She died when he was the 10th Doctor. They just keep meeting in the wrong order. If she ever re-appears in the Doctor's life, it will be ""before"" they got married, and ergo likely ""before"" the Doctor and River were involved in any romantic way. I'm putting before in quotes, in reference to River's life, not the Doctor's.

So what should we expect? The Doctor ""mourns"" River for a thousand years? I think not.

But perhaps more importantly, Doctor's flirting doesn't necessarily mean he's got a romantic interest in Clara. He flirts an awful lot with all the companions - even those who are just friends (i.e.: Donna?). No, the Doctor has a very different kind of interest in Clara. He visited her past, saw her mother buried in the same cemetery as Clara's own 19th century counterpart. He firmly believes that Clara's existence should be impossible. He's gotta find out how she can exist ""simultaneously"" across three different time periods. Which means that he has to make sure Clara stays on as a companion. All the flirting and the charm is part of that. 

Could that turn into a romance? Maybe. Personally I'd kind of enjoy it, because the Doctor has been consistently deprived of a legitimate relationship. But taking two episodes as the sign of that is really premature though, especially considering that there is a pretty obvious (imo) ulterior motive in his overt and forward interest in Clara.

4. Ake and Paulo looked alright.  Ake made a couple of bonehead moves in the second half that seemed to affect his confidence though.  I hope both of them get some more starting time.

5. Our defense was disjointed and lacked communication. This was expected though, given how many changes we had on the pitch today.  I'll blame our lack of defensive presence in the air primarily on this.

6. Terry was visibly in pain at times today.  I want our captain to get healthy.

7. Looks like they were playing Lamps a bit wider and further back today, instead of letting him step up for a shot.

&gt; It should be mentioned that it is rare to find a common ned over the age of 18. When a common ned gets old enough they will no longer wish to hang about in a bus shelter and they will usually graduate to become a 'Dressed Ned'. These neds can be seen in abundance on a Friday or Saturday night in Glasgow city centre. They will usually be wearing clothes which on average would have come to over 300 pounds, not including the tanning parlour fee. They will attend such lovely places as The Moon night club or perhaps Archaos or Destiny or the Savoy or Victorias or Walkabout (previously I would have mentioned Bonkers but the council got some sense on that front). If you wish to see some of these neds but don't wish to go to any of their places you may find it fruitful to hang around the streets at 3am on a weekend night and watch them fight and bottle each other until the sun comes up. I highly recommend the area at the intersection between Sauchihall street and Renfield street as this is truly scumbag central between 2am and 4am every Friday and Saturday night.

We like to go round collecting 'evidence' from time to time and try to interpret our findings honestly. But in the end we have to be reflexive and admit we are social actors, just like everybody else. Academic social researchers are part of society, not detached like a bunch of high and mighty gods looking down from a great height. If the economists had been a little more humble about their academic calling, we might not have got into such a neo-liberal, market-led financial crisis. I wouldn't use literary references in an 'academic' piece, but many readers would find that style rather dry.

Kenny hasn't done too much wrong this season, but I don't really like his attitude (it's unprofessional; like he's playing just for a laugh).

Our defence has been leaky with Pearce (too slow) and Peltier (not captain material; constantly beaten on the deck and in the air; doesn't go forward when playing at full back) in it, while none of our midfielders can pass a ball between them. I genuinely consider our midfielders to be dime-a-dozen journeymen, although Green has the best potential to be a decent defensive midfielder out of all of them.

Varney is one of the worst players I've ever seen in a Leeds shirt, while Morison has looked like he's not bothered since the Crystal Palace game. I think the club would be fine without either of them. Quite frankly, Warnock overhauled the playing squad and filled it with workers lacking an ounce of flair. Most of them need shipping out, because they're all cut from the same cloth and that doesn't give a diverse enough team, in my opinion.

There are two points being pushed by a number of her supporters at the moment. 

* Thatcher was the greatest post-War prime minister and changed forever the political scene in the UK, nay the world, nay the Universe!

* Nothing that happened after 1991 can be blamed on Thatcher

These two points contradict each other. 

She was hugely influential yes, and she did change the political landscape in the UK radically (It is ironic that she is called a Conservative). But as a corollary to that, the results of her actions in government are still very much felt today. The communities she decimated remain decimated, the communities she helped remain helped. You do not need to travel far in the UK to see her handiwork. People still live in these places and their lives today are still shaped by her policies and philosophy. 

On top of that there are plenty of statistics and analysis since she was PM that show what her reign was like.

In terms of the government potentially giving private companies access to information that residents are forced to provide to the government, it is most certainly not ""just the way things are going."" There needs to be clear rules and protections in place. I am not opposed to private contractors processing data for the government (census data has been done this way for a century or so), but the rules and regulations need to be very carefully designed. I am not sure what the best set of regulations would be, but some ideas are: Data must be encrypted, data must not be used for commercial purposes, an appropriate government agency should assess the capabilities of contractors and approve them before they can bid for contracts, no one company should gain an outsize share of the contracting if possible, particularly sensitive information should be stored on private networks not connected to the internet, and I'm sure there are many others (and perhaps some of mine are not necessary or are flawed, I am not an expert).

This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. ...In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses.

true,Audioworm,cnty-expat,Paris (Expat),"Swansea has a large portion of students from Arab nations (Saudi, Qatar and Kuwait are big enough to have their own societies, and iSoc [Islamic Society] is absolutely massive here), and they can be pretty cliquey, but I think it is a side effect of the way British culture is.

Nothing everything involves drinking, but it is a huge part of socialising, and due to their cultural differences that doesn't appeal to them. There is also the fact that the entire collective group can communicate with relative effectiveness due to Arabic dialects covering the whole area. 

I understand the whole wanting to stay with people you are comfortable with, as I did a three month internship in India with a whole bunch of interns from around the world. My best friends from that trip were [Northern] Irish, and the ones I got along with next were the Indians and the Western/Northern Europeans. I had nothing against the Easter Europeans or the Arabs, but that instant connection and shared background wasn't there. I did still hang out with them, and we enjoyed each others company. 

Another thing I've noticed is that members of our iSoc are extremely combative and distant to non-Muslims at times. Our University runs this bullshit faith week where all the faith societies demonstrate and talk about their faith, but iSoc push a lot of it and take up most of the area. I went in to kill some time and have a look around, and ended up in the Islamic area just browsing the historical documents. One of their members came up to and started giving me a friendly talk about what was on display, and what is all said. 

I was politely listening because it wasn't new information to me but I wasn't about to wander off when he was trying his best. He pointed out one of the old pieces of Quran and said how this shared the same story as 'your book' to which I quickly, offhandly told him I wasn't a Christian. He asked what I was instead, and all it took was to say Atheist for his entire face and demeanour to change, as well as a few others come over to me and begin attempting to grill and challenge me. I played along for a while but the arguments were tired and repetitive and I never wanted to be on the aggressive. 

I've had similar confrontations with the Christian Union and they are still friendly and polite with me, even though whenever they bring up the lessons they taught me last time they subtly show disappoint that I haven't converted.  iSoc showed nothing but malice looks, and looked away when I nod and say 'Hi' as we pass.

In that same conversation, the Doctor calls the people of the 7 planets orbiting the red orb as ""sun singers."" That's a funny name for people singing to a planet.

Later, when the doctor points toward the red orb and says, ""that planet,"" he is pointing at the chapel on the asteroid. In the context of this story, the asteroids are planetoids/planets. Does that sound like a stretch? Well, if the red orb is a planet, why doesn't the Doctor call the large inhabited hunks of rock as moons?

Ultimately, it doesn't matter whether it was a planet or a sun. By all appearances, the people were happy when their god was asleep for millions of years and they enjoyed the pageantry of their amazingly long-held religious traditions (the Doctor makes it clear they enjoy it, likening it to Pancake Tuesday as a joke). Would he be taking Clara to see a sad religious tradition?

There's no reason for the sun singers to be happy that the Doctor arrived and helped eliminate the source of gravity keeping their planetoids safe. It's bad storytelling.

The tragic thing is, drivers would never dream of doing this to a bigger bike or one without an L. A lot of drivers don't give the same consideration to L-bikers and they do to L-cagers for some reason.

It isn't that they want to be unfriendly per se, but rather that it isn't their objective to make lots of British friends... so few are prepared to invest the time to build lasting relationships. Many were *sent* here by their parents to set them up with a western education (well... pressured - what we would consider being sent) so to some extent are making the best of what they percieve to be a raw deal.

None of this is helped by the generally poor standard of their English compared to other students, or the fact that by not-integrating as much as others their english does not improve at the rate by which it could.

In contrast, many of the US/European/Australian students I met over my 8 years at university came here because they were anglophiles and wanted to experience the culture (all be it to radically different extents). Like anything, better English language skills certainly correlates with better integration in my experience. US/AUZ/NZ/CAN students tend to integrate seamlessly. 

Having said that - we should consider whether this is even a bad thing. After all, don't we want students that pay foreign money to study here, then go back home afterwards (without piling onto already high long-term migration)?

4 posts of every article, picture, or video about Thatcher.

I seem to be in the minority and don't really have a strong opinion of her given she left power when I was about 11, but I read this subreddit on new and seeing ""5 reasons why thatcher was amazing/good/bad/evil/an alien"" posted multiple times every day is really doing my head in.

**Normally**

The virtual RSS feed to the Guardian is a bit tiresome. Though mostly because it's gone downhill so much in the last few years. If it was still as good as it was 10 years ago I'd probably not mind so much.

I don't see how anything can be done about this, it's just a matter of personal opinion and I wouldn't want any restriction on what sources people can post from. Which leads me onto the rather ridiculous reactions we see to daily mail articles. Yes it's a piece of shit, but grow up just down vote it if you don't like it.

**Regarding the Mods**

Sometimes they just seem to disappear. We currently have 5, but I can only think of 1 or 2 who seem to actually be currently active here. I can understand how other things in life can take priority, but if they don't have time to be mods then perhaps they should stand aside and let others take their place.

She supported the retention of capital punishment

Okay.

She destroyed the country's manufacturing industry

No she didn't.


She voted against the relaxation of divorce laws


And?


She abolished free milk for schoolchildren (""Margaret Thatcher, Milk Snatcher"")

She abolished free milk for children that didn't need it and it wasn't her policy.

She supported more freedom for business (and look how that turned out)

It turned out wonderfully. Do you not enjoy having more than one choice of telephone?
She gained support from the National Front in the 1979 election by pandering to the fears of immigration

And?

She gerrymandered local authorities by forcing through council house sales, at the same time preventing councils from spending the money they got for selling houses on building new houses (spending on social housing dropped by 67% in her premiership)

Which is an excellent thing.

She was responsible for 3.6 million unemployed - the highest figure and the highest proportion of the workforce in history and three times the previous government. Massaging of the figures means that the figure was closer to 5 million

Again. No she wasn't. The trade unions and previous prime ministers were.

She ignored intelligence about Argentinian preparations for the invasion of the Falkland Islands and scrapped the only Royal Navy presence in the islands

And then she kicked their asses back to the Pampas. But then again, come on. That's a loaded charge. You're blaming her for someone else invading the country?

The poll tax

Still exists and its how the majority of councils are funded.

She presided over the closure of 150 coal mines; we are now crippled by the cost of energy, having to import expensive coal from abroad

Such a load of bullshit. The coal from those mines would have been MORE expensive than imported coal.

She compared her ""fight"" against the miners to the Falklands War

Because that is what it was. Thank the trade unions for fighting instead of accommodating.

She privatised state monopolies and created the corporate greed culture that we've been railing against for the last 5 years

Oh please. So no corporation was 'greedy' before 1979? Such a load of bullshit.

She introduced the gradual privatisation of the NHS

A meaningless charge.

She introduced financial deregulation in a way that turned city institutions into avaricious money pits

A meaningless charge.

She pioneered the unfailing adoration and unquestioning support of the USA

Complete bullshit.

She allowed the US to place nuclear missiles on UK soil, under US control

Complete bullshit.

Section 28

Okay.


She opposed anti-apartheid sanctions against South Africa and described Nelson Mandela as ""that grubby little terrorist""

Read the Rivonia trial transcripts.


She support the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and sent the SAS to train their soldiers

Okay

She allowed the US to bomb Libya in 1986, against the wishes of more than 2/3 of the population

Lockerbie.

She opposed the reunification of Germany

Okay?

She invented Quangos

Okay.

She increased VAT from 8% to 17.5%

What, upset you actually have to pay for the government services you use?

She had the lowest approval rating of any post-war Prime Minister


And yet she was reelected three times.

Her post-PM job? Consultant to Philip Morris tobacco at $250,000 a year, plus $50,000 per speech

Okay. That's pretty low for speeches.

The Al Yamamah arms contract with the Saudi Arabian dictatorship

Okay.

She opposed the indictment of Chile's General Pinochet

Okay.

Social unrest under her leadership was higher than at any time since the General Strike

BECAUSE THE FUCKING UNIONS CAUSED THE UNREST BECAUSE THEY REFUSED TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNMENT.

She presided over interest rates increasing to 15%

And yet later you on you blame her for high inflation.


BSE

hahhahah. So did she invent aids and ebola as well?

She presided over 2 million manufacturing job losses in the 79-81 recession

Not her fault. Blame the trade unions and kow towing governments befoe her.

She opposed the inclusion of Eire in the Northern Ireland peace process

And?

She supported sanctions-busting arms deals with South Africa

Okay.

Cecil Parkinson, Alan Clark, David Mellor, Jeffrey Archer, Jonathan Aitkin

Are these other people you have demonized?

Crime rates doubled under Thatcher

Due to unemployment due to the industrial closures that were forced upon her by previous governments and trade unions.

Black Wednesday - Britain withdraws from the ERM and the pound is devalued. Cost to Britain - £3.5 billion; profit for George Soros - £1 billion

her fault exactly how? And interesting how you fail to note the labour government that preceding her going begging to the IMF.

Poverty doubled while she opposed a minimum wage

Because the minimum wage would have increased poverty.

She privatised public services, claiming at the time it would increase public ownership. Most are now owned either by foreign governments (EDF) or major investment houses. The profits don't now accrue to the taxpayer, but to foreign or institutional shareholders.

Give me a break down of every single privatised company and its ownership.

She cut 75% of funding to museums, galleries and other sources of education

Okay.


In the Thatcher years the top 10% of earners received almost 50% of the tax remissions

She lowered an insane tax rate and the country benefited. Deal with it.

21.9% inflation

And yet you blame her for high interest rates.

Well, yeah, that is a point, but then again, it is because these are our users.

If we sanitise our own content (oops, better not post anything more from the guardian because I've seen an article presented from them earlier today) then there's not much use actually *having* a subreddit, since it won't have stuff from people who participate, and it will slowly die.  

Mods should be here to get rid and prune 'pointless' stuff; I don't think the guardian \ anti-Americanism thing counts, otherwise we'll descend into the realm of 'OMG censoring sub-reddit' - and I'm sure many subreddits have melted under *that* particular onslaught of wailing.

true,SirMuttley,cnty-uk,British in Bangkok,"&gt; Three of your points are about user submitted content (Thatcher, Guardian, Anti-Americanism) - with reddit being about user submissions, this seems a bit redundant.

The question was what do you dislike. I gave my answer.

I'm pretty sure I said specifically that I wouldn't want anything to restrict the sources of posts. Which covers the Guardian. 

As for Thatcher, it's the reposts that I have issues with not the original posts themselves. This can be dealt with if the mods were more active.

For the Anti Americanism, I'm not talking of anti american articles but the attitude of some redditors commenting on those articles. I'm not suggesting censorship, I'm just saying I dislike this side of the subreddit.

&gt; If we sanitise our own content (oops, better not post anything more from the guardian because I've seen an article presented from them earlier today) then there's not much use actually having a subreddit, since it won't have stuff from people who participate, and it will slowly die.

so you missed the part where I said:

&gt;&gt;  it's just a matter of personal opinion and **I wouldn't want any restriction on what sources people can post from**. 

As for mods...

&gt; Mods should be here to get rid and prune 'pointless' stuff; I don't think the guardian \ anti-Americanism thing counts

And I never suggested they should. I answered the question ""What do you dislike about r/unitedkingdom"". Perhaps you should reread my original post in the context of the question posed by the OP.

Say what you want about how well we played considering the circumstances - yes, we were amazing 1) without Bale, 2) without Lennon, 3) without Sandro, 4) in the pouring rain away from home, 5) fighting back from a 2-2 home first leg, 6) without Kaboul, 7) without Defoe or any other striker, 8) with a new coach, new system, poor run of form and players in the side that haven't seen a lot of first-team football, 9) etc. etc. we all like to fire these things off to ""excuse"" any losses, but the biting, harsh reality is it wasn't enough.

But for you to make a profit from their labour they would not be getting paid the full value of their labour, this is the main basis of anticapitalism, plus, someone is making profit from the wage labour of the people who made that machine. The best solution to this within the capitalist system would be co-operative ownership and management of a company, everyone participates and receives products equal to their input. In most anti-capitalist thinking owning the means of production, and taking the biggest shares of profits, whilst working alongside those you employ is a lesser evil compared to merely reaping the benefits of those toiling under you, it's generally what small businesspeople do

If you want a really decent answer for that can I suggest /r/DebateaCommunist? You'll get good answers from a broad political spectrum including communist (obv), various types of anarchists, socialists, and capitalists etc. You'll get a far more in-depth answer than I can give.

To judge anti-capitalism correctly (if that's what you intend to do) you must realise that there is a larger school of thought than there is within capitalism.

The episode where he's a teacher (Human Nature/Family of Blood) made me feel sorry for Martha in that episode. The Doctor asks her to do a big favor which involves her enduring sexism and racism (and his human self's idiocy) and she has the misfortune of watching him fall in love with someone else. John Smith/the Doctor doesn't owe Martha anything but it's still gonna sting.

It's like when they got trapped in 1969 in Blink and she had to support him. I bet she faced racism there too. And then she walked the world for him. She always did what needed to be done and she didn't let her feelings for the Doctor get in the way of that.

And she never pressured him to like her back either. She knew he wasn't interested and she dealt with that without putting the Doctor on the spot. She kept her comments to herself.

And in the end, she was brave enough to get out of a relationship (platonic) that was not good for her. That's hard for anyone to do, real life or fictional.

I recently decided I'd cut down on the nights out, because in reality I wasn't having a very good time and I'd only actually been going to keep up with friends. I found out that pretty much immediately my social circle shrunk by about 90% - even people I'd known for several years didn't seem to care that I was no longer hanging out at the pub, and worse, they didn't want to do anything outside of the pub. 

It's really sad, but I've had to actually learn new social skills to 1: Connect with people in non-pub environments 2: Be able to be sociable when not completely wankered.

**Scenario:** Boris Johnson decides to press ahead with introducing driverless trains on the Underground, and will use the most disgusting tactics to push it through. As a result, leagues of drivers lose their jobs, or are demoted to lower positions, with subsequently lower pay. It will be a bloodbath. 

But, most importantly, will the public be supportive or will they oppose the move? They will almost inevitably be supportive, not just because Boris is the 'loveable oaf' because the strikes they remember  and the arrogance of someone like Bob Crow will linger in their minds, whilst the prospect of more smooth journeys to work will be too hard to resist for the average commuter. 

Surely if you want to secure your position and your importance, taking the moral high ground and merely putting two fingers up to others is putting yourself in a very risky position. People like revenge.  Instead, making yourself seem as human as possible not just to your members but to the public, and eating a slice of humble pie is far better, even if it makes you seem weak initially. 

N.B. The driverless trains thing is currently happening in Paris; line 1, one of the most important lines, is being fully automated (I'd compare line 1 to the Central line; both busy and both connect the business district to the nice parts). However, the number of drivers losing their jobs is **zero**, because of rationality and co-operation, and not simply a standoff between unions and management.

Using a spur-of-the-moment gambit, the Doctor placed himself into a Chameleon Arch and let Martha be his caretaker.   He went to an era where racism was strong, gave her limited instructions and trusted her to take care of him.   That was quite frankly amazing.   I can't recall the Doctor placing that much trust in anyone, especially under such heavy circumstances.  

Then, shortly after experiencing that, and having everyone she held dear taken and a third of the population exterminated, she was released down to the hell that was Earth to walk across the globe for a full year, her only task to not die, keep her faith in the Doctor and spread that faith to others.   AND SHE DID.  

Think about that for a minute.  Rose could not have done that.   Nor Donna.  Nor Amy.   Could YOU have done that?  Held faith in someone for a full year with no plan explained to you, no guarantees of victory, no one to watch your back while living through an apocalyptic nightmare?  

The saddest part of Martha, and it happened to Rose and others too, is that she ended up a soldier for the Doctor.  She was smart, with a Medical degree, but in the end, she grabs a rifle and shoots aliens dead with Mickey.   I just felt there should have been a happier ending for her.

true,matcht,lfc12,,"I can understand why many fans are anxious about us going for Williams as our big centre back target but just because he isn't an exotic sounding foreign defender and seeming as if Rodgers is just buying players he is accustomed to doesn't mean he isn't capable.

He has been the leader of a Swansea side who have had a shockingly good defence since entering the Premier League, if you question his ability then look at how hard we have found it scoring against Swansea (their first team at least), he was particularly outstanding in the semi-finals of the Capital One Cup against Chelsea. 

The qualities that he possesses are something I feel our current centre backs perhaps lack (excluding the soon to be retired Carra). He is a leader, very vocal and passionate. He regularly makes strong challenges and is willing to get into the rough side of the game, no doubt down to his experience in the lower leagues. Over 2 seasons he has proved himself in the PL, unlike some of the younger defenders linked with us. He very rarely gets injured or misses matches. Has an existing relationship with Rodgers so would fit in well.

I know about what he said regarding Suarez but there was nothing in the game following his statements that suggested he really had a deep dislike of Suarez.

If we can get him for 10-12m I would be happy, as along as we sign a promising centre back who can develop alongside Agger and Williams.

It's also the umpteenth time you have expressed your disappointment in my debating skills, you must be getting used to it by now, although I suspect it's just a debating strategy on your part.

Edit:  Of course, the irony was that although they passed a welter of authoritarian legislation and introduced various extensions to courts' sentencing powers, ""short sharp shocks"" etc., the Thatcher government still managed to increase the amount of recorded crime in England and Wales by 40% between 1979 and 1985/6 despite an increase in law and order spending of a similar amount (i.e. 40%), introducing 13,000 more police officers and doubling police pay.  You'll doubtless try to tell me that that was about huge improvements in detection, but it left them highly embarrassed if you read the historical record and they were rightly ridiculed for it at the time (as objective observers who lived through it will doubtless recall - fear of many violent crimes reach a new high as social cohesion began to collapse).

I don't think anyone is really seriously pleased that she's dead. But the line that she is some kind of saint to be revered just doesn't fly with ordinary people. Boris is talking about naming his airport after her, her funeral is distinctly presidential is style... it's just completely detached from reality.

There is room for legitimate criticism here, and the manifestation of the critism as ""angry mob"" is the natural way to challenge the ""gleeful fairy mob"" that has managed to break the holy grail in its hurry to grasp it.

We use browser fingerprinting ( an advanced version of this example https://panopticlick.eff.org/ ) + already stored data, logins, subscriptions, facebook data, google data and anything available on the open web to profile users - BIG DATA ! You have no idea of how much info you can get on people. I knew a bit about the principles of it, but once I got deeper into the project I can only imagine what google knows about me or any of you. 


Electoral Rolls and Credit references are jokes compared to the profile generated by your online presence, all I need to do is place a tiny js/cookie on the site to literally see what are you clicking on the page, how much you spending on that page, what is that page about. Gathering the data is easy, the hard part comes next: DATA ANALYSIS ! Aggregation and interpretation.

This is the OPEN WEB.

P.S. Reddit has this kind of data, maybe they do or maybe they don't aggregate it, interpret it, use it, but it has data on you. All of your browsing history ( while on reddit ) + your opinions and social aspects. It's a gold mine when it comes to data.

P.S.2 Pretty much the basis of online user tracking https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/01/primer-information-theory-and-privacy

P.S.3 Why Google should terrify you, Google is the largest entity by FAR in terms of available data, it's been doing it for a long time and it pioneered the technology ( look into Hadoop, MapReduce ).

Yes, once or twice he was caught offside in key positions. But those positions were glimpses of old Ade, where he was on the line of the defenders, running through.

Similarly, I don't remember any particularly memorable balls from Gylfi or Holtby. There was one actually, where he almost controlled it, but it came at some speed.

Similarly, he was the only person with some (arguable) pace in our front 4, something which has been really damaging to our attacking efforts of late. For this reason, in order to get the ball (because he wasn't being supplied, as he was isolated up front), he had to push out to the wings, which provided width, and was creative for the team.

He has been difficult to defend this season, but this last game we saw constant passion and drive from him, in chasing the ball, ACTUALLY TAKING ON DEFENDERS, facing the goal, and providing a third dimension to our attack.

Without pace, we really lacked, and we actually, somewhat, relied on set pieces today (much to my dismay). Ade seemed to be the only person who really adapted to this, and he was intelligent in the way that he played.

true,shahino,null,null,"My thoughts as an EU citizen currently studying in the UK:

- Many of the chinese students are pressured by their parents into studying in the west, particularly because it improves the social status of both them and their parents.
- Since their understanding of english can be lacking or below what is needed in order to keep up with the lectures, they might end up learning less than if they just stayed in a chinese uni.
- The british universities dont really care about the overseas students. The government is heavily reducing the funding for the unis, which means they have to get their money from somewhere else. An EU student has to pay around £9000 per year, while I've heard asian students  are paying around £20000 (dont know if accommodation costs are included).
- Many asian students come from really wealthy families. They will leave lots of money in casinos, luxury shops and restaurants, so they are likely to become an important part of the local economy.
- Foreign students all share the same experiences and difficulties living abroad. You're thousands of miles from home, sometimes on the other side of the earth! You can't just go to your parents during weekends, you'll miss moms home made cooking, there is no security net or any family to take care of you if you feel ill physically or psychologically.
- foreign students need at least a week to settle, thats why some of us arrives early. Learning how the bureaucracy works here was particularly hard:uni, mobile phone contract, NHS, laws, sorting a flat, gas, electricity etc.
- Depression. Everyone will get it. In the beginning I often caught myself missing home and I felt REALLY lonely although I had made friends.
- At least two chinese students committed suicide during my first year and no one gave a shit. One jumping from a tower and another one from a bridge.
- Sociallising. You Brits are really fun to party with, but one has to be accustomed to your ways. A night out includes heavy drinking, loudness and drunken behaviour, which I have noticed puts many international people off (except from nations where heavy drinkinhg is the norm). Its literally impossible to understand a drunk brit (sometimes a sober one too), and especially young people use slang or expressions we have never heard of  before.

To quote:
&gt;Walking into this environment was unsettling at first; the concept of the ""pre-lash"" is far more extreme outside of London. I suppose we're all too concerned with looking cool to pour alcohol into ourselves through a funnel every time we leave the house. But I wasn't in London any more, and it was made very clear as soon as I arrived that I was going to have to drop my booji metropolitan pretensions.

And

&gt;The thing with modern students is that they peak too early. If you're puking at 10PM, chances are you aren't gonna see dawn and Ed, Toby and the other guys had already slunk off back to the bosom of some Black Americanos.

It's all about the sustainability of the team. When you think it's good enough **every year** just to finish 4th and qualify without ever actually winning anything, like Wenger and Arsenal, then it's a joke...However, we're in a much different situation. We're attempting to build a new stadium while also turning our team into a permanent CL contender. This takes $$$$$$$. If we miss out on CL this year, we could lose Bale, which would be a HUGE blow. Additionally, if we make CL, we could bring in some big name players. The money from qualifying alone would be a huge boost. For this **ONE SEASON**, I would rather lose out on the Europa in order to have everyone healthy and rested to finish top four.

In 3-4 years, when we have a deep squad and the ability to turn a profit every season regardless of CL, then yes, I would much rather have a nice shiny trophy in the cabinet, but for now, I would rather pave the way for us to get there.

I guess if we are playing a 4 2 3 1 he COULD break in... but I'm not sure he's good enough with his defensive duties... so if you're putting him in you might as well put the odd CM out there (or even Livermore... who I forgot was only 23, thought he was older for some reason but Livermore is a different topic all together).

Pretty much everywhere that isn't yellow on that seating chart. 

I am definitely not the most qualified person to answer this question, but from my experience the MHL seats were awesome. 

The view was good, the people we were with and those around us were awesome and it was a really incredible experience all around. Most people were surprised we had come all the way over from the U.S. just to see Chelsea play Fulham. Strangers we encountered at the half were all very friendly as well.  



The seats highlighted in yellow on the Shed End were basically dominated by the Fulham fans and they were all funneled into the entrance by police on horseback. It was quite the spectacle.

One VERY surprising thing we didn't know is that there is a rule against drinking alcohol within sight of the pitch during the game. People crowd the halls during this half and start slamming beer, so plan accordingly. You can also take a 20oz bottle of whatever ""Soft-Drink"" you want, they will just confiscate the cap upon entry.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think this episode is completely underrated. One of the biggest things that irk me about what people say about this episode is that it has gaping plot holes. I do not see this at all. One point being that why can the Doctor and Clara breathe in space and with it why when the Sun ""parasite"" explodes are the people all not dead. My first question is, why are so many people interested in the science fact of a show if it is science fiction? Have you all completely lost your imaginations? Because that's what I use when I watch this awesome show. I don't think of why it wouldn't work, but HOW it might work, and not only that, there's some fucking science you could throw on it to make it seem plausible anyway. It seems that the Sun Parasite seemed t have the properties of a post-main sequence red supergiant star nearing the end of its life cycle, thus it has expelled most of its energy and is plausible that you could not be burnt to a crisp if you were a ways away from it. As fr gravity it might not produce that much of it because it is dying, Slow rotation or what have you. Not only that, but its also a living being with at least some sentience, so maybe it can control its rotation or heat output, it needs emotions from memories to survive, so it would need to create an environment so other beings could contribute that kind of sustenance it needs. Remember, when The Doctor is explaining about why they do the ritual it's because the ""Old God"" or ""Grandfather"" created all life and they appease it this way. So there's your explanation on that. As for why did the leaf disappear and The Doctor's memories remain, because maybe that 1000 year old motherfucker with the memory capacity to register and keep 1000 years or more worth of memories can't just have that shit siphoned from him like that. Time Lords are one of the oldest races and one of the most advanced and intelligent, but that's beside the point, it feeds off oof emotions of memories, so it was feeding off of how he felt, not eating his memories. Therefore, the leaf disappears because you can't see his emotions being eaten, but you can see the infinite possibility of emotions being taken from an old ass leaf, that's probably brittle as fuck anyways, and not only that, the leaf drying up and disappearing is probably symbolic of Clara letting go of missing her mother and the scene was poignant as fuck. It rips your heartstrings more to see the leaf disappear than if you didn't see it disappear. I mean seriously, imagination folks! This episode was awesome and the only thing that has even gotten worse is the fact that the TARDIS looks different and kind of shitty. As much as I like Classic Who and how they're making The Doctor dive back into his roots and take pages from the old reincarnations, fucking with the TARDIS and making it look like the old ones is kind of dumb.

AND OF COURSE I MISSED A LETTER IN THE TITLE! :(

Last time I posted the [progress photos of this dress](http://imgur.com/a/oP9gK), this subreddit’s reaction was the motivation I needed to get the dress finished. I started the dress in early January and just finished it this week. In total, I’m guessing I spent somewhere in the neighbourhood of 120 hours on it. I don’t even want to add up what the supplies ended up costing. I can tell you the dress itself is about 10 metres of fabric, with 3m of petticoat that has 10m of netting (layered in four) and 12m of bridal crinoline attached to it. There’s also a ridiculous amount of rhinestones, which show far better in person than in photos. There’s easily 1500+ rhinestones on it, I actually lost count.. the light blue has matching rhinestones as well as clear, the gold has gold stones, and the blue has matching blue and the clear crystal star pattern.

I was also asked about commissions last time. I am so sorry, but I don’t think I could recreate this dress again. While it’s technically possible, the amount of time and money I put into it likely wouldn’t be worth it for some. If I were to pay myself my province’s minimum wage for even HALF my time, that would be $600 alone.. plus the cost of materials. I only had the time to invest in this dress because my husband was deployed for most of the creation process; doing it again now that he’s back would take considerably longer.

With that said, I am willing to consider offers on this exact dress, AFTER I wear it to FanExpo. PM me or email me at didimentionittravelsintime@gmail.com (yeah I know the address is missing an also, I got so excited that it was available that I accidentally a whole word) and we’ll talk. I honestly don’t know what to even ask for the dress which is why I’m taking offers. If you think you’ll fit into it, send me a message and we can talk about your measurements. Right now it’s hemmed for me in converse, and I’m about 5’3”. It has a built in bra under the corset lining, and I made it slightly larger than my own measurements which is why it’s laced so tightly on me. The measurements I used were 34-28.5-36, though the corset back allows for quite a bit of bust/waist leniency. Hip measurement doesn’t REALLY factor in here, as that’s all gathered petticoat and fabric with loads of space. 

If you’d like to see the dress in person, I’ll be wearing it to FanExpo Vancouver on April 20th, which is the Saturday. My husband will be dressed as Eleven (likely Sherriff Eleven as it’s an excuse for him to wear a cowboy hat), so feel free to stop us and say hi/take photos. We’ll also be there as Ten &amp; Rose from The Idiot’s Lantern on Sunday.

No, its not illegal. Neither the person(s) streaming said copyright material or the ISP can be sued. If it is illegal, then maybe I should be sued for streaming the London Olympics through a IP Proxy to use BBC's player. Last time I checked, weren't the Olympic games copyrighted? The only way you can get sued or even into any sort of trouble is if you illegally download said material and make a copy for non-commercial use.

You should be able to find out lots on the internet. Use your prior experience to answer questions.

Just because it's an aquarium, don't expect that all customers will ask about fish. You will likely get a lot of families and tourist folk. They will want to know about food, toilets, costs, discounts etc.

Team challenges; These can range from discussions to all out building something. It's important to remember they are not looking for you to get the right answer. They want to see how you behave in a group task. Talk over people too much and boss people about, not good. Don't say anything, not good. In group tasks, it's best to try and start the discussion and encourage others (especially the quiet ones) to have a go and have their say. It shows you are compassionate and willing to listen.

Bring an object? Exactly what it says. Love cycling? Take a bike helmet. Play the guitar, take a plec. Enjoy porn, do not take a video. Keep it clean, you will be expected to explain what this item means to you and why. So make sure you prepare something. It doesn't need to be fish related, it will just need to reflect a part of your personality.

Other tips;

Keep you answers clear and concise.

Don't understand a question? Aske them to rephrase it.

If they offer you a drink, water only. Hot drinks can cause all sorts of issues.

If you get asked a question that stumps you, take a damn sip of that water to stall time whilst you think of an answer.

It's the circumvention that's illegal - you are accessing content which you are not authorized by the copyright holder to access from your location.

What if you went outside of your home country, or the country you live in currently on vacation/holiday and brought your laptop with you to watch Doctor Who? You speak of illegally accessing region locked content by circumventing the security policy the website/company has set in place. You plug your laptop in from somewhere in North America and try to access the iPlayer on BBC.com, you then find out that you cannot access it because the website is region locked and you're far away from home. You don't want to watch BBC america (or the hotel does not have the channel). So what do you do? You use a proxy to mask your IP address so you can stream the episode. Now you've become a hypocrite. Are you going to be arrested/sued? No. You aren't because BBC is not losing any money. You don't have to pay a dime to stream content from their website, nor are you downloading the episode illegally. Now, if the BBC did require you to pay for a streaming license, then yes; you are now violating company policies because you're getting content *free of charge*. 

I'll give you another example. Xbox live and PlayStation network both require their online users to sign up for a account in whatever region their in. This is because some region specific content is region locked, but it does not stop users from creating another online account for said region. They do it so they can purchase games/movies/add one/music that is not available to them. They also need to use a credit card and address that is used in said region. Fact of the matter is, both Sony and Microsoft do not care because ultimately; they are not losing any money. Now, if people we using something to circumvent the product charge, then yes, the companies are going to loose out on their money. Thing is, I think you're a bit confused as to what violating copyright is. BBC allows users to stream shows for free. If the BBC charges a certain amount of money to stream a piece of content, and you download it through a torrent site instead of paying, then yes; that would be illegal because now the BBC is losing money


Tl;Dr its only illegal if the product in question costs money, which it doesn't because its being streamed for free on the BBC website. What the user is doing is by no means illegal.

Playing just in front of the defence in the 4-2-3-1 formation is probably the best formation to utilize his passing ability, whilst meaning he does not need to be sprinting up the pitch to join the attack due to the bank of 3 infront of him. He can just sit in front of the defence, spraying balls to Bale and Lennon on the wings, in a DLP role.

I think his performance in the last 15min againist Everton was excellent. Some of his passes were ridiculous and he [completed 23/26 of them.](http://cdn1.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1544277/0kpJ3.png) And the quality of his assist yesterday for Dempseys second also seems to have been overlooked.

I hope he does stay as I think he definately brings something to the team which no one else can really provide, but unfortunately I fear that he will be going due to the fact that for the 2 positions in front of the defence we have: Dembele, Sandro, Parker, Livermore, Carroll, &amp; Huddlestone.

A great read, and so accurate about nightlife these days. There's nothing interesting to me about going out to the pretentious, shitty clubs with the orange slags in skintight clothes pulling the duckface (or duck arse, as shown in these photos), men with over-coiffed hair and awful ASOS clothing trying to be individuals but all looking the same. You get a lot of these places 'up north', with the current trend of wanting to be a WAG / TOWIE celebrity. It's awful.

I'm only in my late 20's, but I'm already jaded from it. In my day (old woman voice), we went to overcrowded indie clubs, where the music was awesome, your hair got frizzy in about 5 minutes of entering the club because it was so hot, drinks were 50p and tasted like shit, and you danced all night with your hands in the air and love for your neighbour. 

Even the upmarket wine bars were better 10 years ago. These days it's less about enjoyment and being with your mates and dancing the night away, and more about how you're going to look in your Facebook photos. Glad I'm not 18 today.

At a guess, the significance of Rose is the break she represents with many of the classic companions. As a kid, I remember watching Bonnie Langford in support of Baker and McCoy, and her character was less undeveloped than absent. With a few famous exceptions, like Susan and Sarah-Jane, many classic companions seemed to spend a lot of their time trailing around after the Doctor and getting captured by his adversaries. Rose's appearance during the reimagining changed the balance in the Doctor/companion relationship on a seemingly irreversible basis, and I think that's one reason why she appeals. This seemed to be one good feature of RTD's ethos when he brought the series back, although I'm not wholly a fan of his, either!

Another may be the sympathetic role she plays, providing the Doctor with companionship at a time when he is a lonely wanderer, emotionally damaged by the Time War. I'd hesitate to add more on this subject until others have had their say because I'm not the most knowledgable Whovian. Others may indeed have good reasons for claiming that all of the above is wrong.

I agree with you that 11's companions have been really good - along with the three-dimensionality they are afforded in the reimagined series, Moffat seems to make his companions integral to the story arc.

It's up to you to make yourself as available as all the other (native) students basically. By that, I simply mean: don't immediately go off and find a clique of fellow Canadians or North Americans - throw yourself into the social and students union events. Also try and find a place living where the other British students are (I find that foreign students often are encouraged to buy into private student accommodation instead of the University sanctioned stuff where the majority of British students go). So if Manchester has its own student village then opt for that. Remember that 98% of the British people there won't know each other from before Uni either - so you're all on a level playing field.

As for our reaction to you: it'll just be exactly the same as with other Anglophones. We don't really see Canadians as overtly foreign, in a weird way. Much like Australians and New Zealanders - we're used to hearing the accents and you're just our friendly overseas cousins. You'll get some interest in your origin initially, stuff like: ""Ohh cool accent, where are you from!"" - but after that people will just see you as another student and easily approachable.

Not quite.

They are only illegal when the person is expected to work to the same standard/requirements as if they are paid employee. If you are free to come and go, work whatever hours you want etc - then the internship would be legal.

As to enforcement - it's not actually the government's job to enforce laws. That's for the police and local trading standards bodies.

As to public pressure - nope, very rarely and only about things people care about, such as fluffy animals and cute children.

She had some amazing episodes, and great character development. She often helped figure out ways of getting out of situations in clever ways, though she did have her share of ""damsel in distress"" episodes.

Martha had a chance at being great, but was ruined by making her a ""rebound companion."" Though some of my favorite episodes were during her run as companion, and I really enjoyed her character in her cameo returns later in the series.

I really wanted to like Amy. I really did. I just couldn't bring myself to like her for some reason. I think it's mostly to do with Rory. A good amount of their stories revolved around her and Rory realizing they loved each other only when their lives were in danger. I'll say something that may get criticized, but I really felt *at times* that the Doctor seemed more of a supporting character to Amy and Rory. That's not to say there weren't any episodes with Amy and Rory that I enjoyed (Vincent and the Doctor was amazing!).

TheJoeSco couldn't have explained any better. I'm starting this UK guide basically so people on Spanish speaking countries can have reliable information and travel tips about everywhere in the UK. I'm willing to compensate any work used, and will do as soon as I can afford it. For now, the only thing I can do, is grow a lot, get many viewers, and anyone who's helping out will get the benefit of it by credits and links. There is absolutely nothing like what I'm doing in the whole web, so it's likely to grow and develop quick.

Also, I'm doing some kind of online magazine with news, music, events... For those who are planning to study or work here for a while to improve their English or those who already live here.

I have got most of south England and Wales covered by my self, and I'm currently struggling to get pictures from everywhere in north England, as trips there are too long and expensive. I'm doing all this using my savings from my waiter job, so any help provided will be much appreciated and remembered in the future if things go well

Thats right, just lump us all together. Forget that the independence vote doesn't have a snowballs chance in hell of passing and that the vast majority of Scots are not interested in it at all. 

Comments like that play right into the separatists hands. It wouldn't be fair to label a UKIP press release as representing all 'the English', so please don't do the same for SNP released information, yours is the exact reaction they want you to have.

* Will Scotland adopt the 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend' view, and become friends with countries like Argentina? Scots talk about social unity being destroyed surely this would be the most damaging?

You asked how protests effect change. When you know the answer to that. Stop being disingenuous.

You seem to have missed the subtle, highlighted text. Try reading what I wrote again.

&gt;how will protesting gain you equal rights?

But to humour you, I direct you to any historic text of civil rights protests.

I have mentored students teachers or volunteers who spend weeks/months on an unpaid placement in my school. Just so they would have enough experience to apply for work. During that time- they receive a tonne of on the job training &amp; practical experience. 

At the end of which they receive a reference &amp; often get feedback on specific areas, so they can build on their strengths &amp; areas of development. They were essentially an intern. The 'intern' never has any real accountability- but is given the same involvement as one of the team. Of course there are the same expectations for conduct &amp; work ethic, but that is part of the valuable experience- learning what it is like to work in your industry, in the real world. Beyond the textbooks. That experience is invaluable &amp; certainly helps them find employment. 

Since jobs are scarce &amp; you need experience to even get your foot in the door- it might just give that candidate an edge. To me the internship is an extension of college or university. You don't get paid to be there so why is this different? You suck it up because that's what it takes to get into your job of choice these days. 

SO genuine question here: If a company is offering an internship: Providing an intern with valuable experience, feedback &amp; indirect training (where permanent staff show them the ropes) That costs the company time (and therefore money) &amp; effort. Why should they also have to pay that person? Demanding that they do would surely put companies off?

That's your place - many internships contain little of no training, just menial work. Arcadia had interns cleaning the office and packing clothes iirc, jobs that should really be paid.

I am not in any way against internships, I am very much for them as an invaluable way of getting real-world practical knowledge, which is why I think they should be open to people whose parents can't afford to support them. 

The difference between unpaid internships and further education is that there is a system (albeit imperfect) of loans and grants to financially support people trying to get ahead. It's not a question of 'sucking it up' for most people, it's a matter of 4 out of 5 young people not being able to afford to do an unpaid internship in London (where there are a lot of these positions). My biggest complaint with unpaid internships isn't the principle of exploitation, but the fact that they exclude people from careers on the basis of their financial background. Of course, there are many many other areas where background unfairly gives an advantage but that doesn't make this less of one.

The company offering the internship (if it is a good, structured internship like the one you describe, which sadly they often aren't) gains the benefit of the intern's work to offset the time/labour spent training them how to do this work. I doubt very much whether the practice of internships would stop if the law was better enforced, as many companies (big and small) offer paid internships so they must have found a way to make this financially rewarding for them.

An internship for something like journalism or fashion design makes sense though I've never agreed with totally unpaid internships. People have to eat and major work is major work even if you are learning on the job. But internships for retail? This is bull. This is a company not paying entry level retail clerks a fair wage.

Management has it's headaches and once you're at a multi-store level it can require a lot of training, but before that, no. It's just not something that requires an internship program.

No. Once you've been unemployed for 6 months you are required to apply for pretty much everything. Your degree does not make you too good to apply for jobs like cleaning.

A fair point, but if you look at the internship descriptions some are intentionally written to sound as if you'll get some worthwhile/valuable experience - but once you begin the reality is very different, and you're actually replacing the last intern who only had menial tasks. Look up the Arcadia case for more on this.

Thatcher was not a Conservative she was a neoliberal carpet bagger. She destroyed the infrastructure and cashed out on the assets and left Britain in the terrible lopsided economic mess it finds itself today. Of course Tony Blair was just as bad for carrying on the madness that is the idea that markets and public interest are synonymous.

BTW no I'm not a supporter of the boorish unimaginative and myopic 1970's unions but that is not an excuse for selling off cheap, crushing the working class and allowing the capital rich classes free for all. Look at German trade relations for the mature way forward.

Oh I don't know, because you want to eat and have a roof over your head? You don't get 'paid' to go to university per se but you do get loans and grants – because we as a society deem forcing people who don't have rich parents to choose between education and survival a tad unfair. You're training your student teachers, giving them experience... for what? To work in a school, presumably. Similarly in the corporate world an internship is supposed to lead to a job in that industry if not with the same company. For any skilled trade that doesn't want to die out with its current batch of practitioners, training is just as valuable to those doing the training as the trainee, so why on earth shouldn't they be paid for doing a day's work?

Because they're common, people expect to work them. If you're leaving on good terms, while you might slack off a little, most people wouldn't actively do anything to hurt the company they're leaving. If you're leaving on poor terms, the company might waive the notice period. They might also waive the notice period if you simply ask nicely, especially for lower level jobs.

It's actually quite a bit more difficult to fire an employee in the UK than the US, especially if they've worked there more than two years, and there's usually an internal disciplinary system with firing somebody as a last resort. Most companies find it more worthwhile to just pay the person their normal wage during the notice period than to risk a lawsuit for unfair dismissal. They might even ask somebody to take paid leave during their notice period.

Generally speaking, employees in the UK have a lot more rights than in the US. This is just an example of one of the few extra responsibilities we have in exchange.

Sorry if you're not from the US and I've made an incorrect assumption.

So you cut your losses &amp; leave? No one is forced into these placements &amp; if they don't offer what you need on any level then leave. If you are receiving no money, no experience, no training- why on earth would you stay on? 

&gt; It restricts entry into many profressions to those with wealthy parents, whom are able to support them through this period of non-pay. Those worse off don't get a look in since they've likely got bills to pay and need to eat.

If you have your heart set on an industry that you have no experience in, that is overrun with applicants (so they get to choose the 'cream of the crop') then you might need to make sacrifices one way or another.

For some that might mean working two jobs or working in another industry to save for their unpaid work experience. I admit it sucks- but I still don't view any differently as having to get a student loan for university vs having rich parents who pay for it. I had to work for a year before even having the finances to start university. I then had to work while studying to cover my expenses &amp; pay my student loan. Continued to pay my loan off, all while in my entry level NQT role. All that to get into an industry that is capped forever at a relatively low-average wage (compared to all my other degree qualified friends with 10+ years experience) But it was my choice. I could moan about the fact that 15 years earlier (in my country) people got paid to go to teacher's college. 
But I made the choice. I wanted it. Sure I wish I had rich parents who could have made my life more comfortable. But I didn't so I just got on with my life. 

The current situation is dictated by the economy. If times were booming &amp; there was a shortage in your chosen industry- then life would be different. But instead times are grim &amp; there is a glut of overly qualified inexperienced graduates. 

People need to decide on their commitment to their chosen industry &amp; what they are prepared to sacrifice to get their dream job. 

Hell- maybe the internship in that chosen industry might open their eyes to the fact that they want to do something different. Time well spent. 

If they don't like the situation on offer, perhaps they should choose another industry?",0,1365766967,null,0,1365768305,0,c9dp0d8,t3_1c72vl,t1_c9dp0d8,t1_c9dotfy,null,1431583648,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

There are graduates queuing up to get an internship in fashion so if you won't do it someone else will.

I used to recruit interns while working in fashion and interviewed people willing to travel for 2 hours a day from far outside London, at their own expense, to work full days for nothing more than the cost of their lunch. And most I interviewed were on their 2nd or 3rd internship, having done it for over a year without a job insight. One girl told me about a friend who had done 7 or 8 internships without a job.

Felt so sorry for them, but fashion pays so badly as it is and the general feeling within the industry is that people should be thankful of the opportunity to work in fashion, you'd often hear people say things like: 'I had spent a unpaid year as an intern so why shouldn't they?'

Why don't you make it about the *behaviour*, not about dumb ad-hominems?

We see plenty of posts on here about how it's wrong of the ""lefties"" to ""hate"" the tories, and how ridiculous it is that the lefty liberals all accuse the tories of being ""evil"" and ""greedy"" just because we don't agree with their political policies. Obviously the tories want the best for everyone, it's just that we don't understand how fair and enlightened their policies are (we're told).

Now obviously, we're going to get stuff like that in a political debate, about what laws we should have and how taxes are applied - we're obviously going to have disagreements between the ""left party"" and the ""right party"".

But this is a matter of an *independent company* engaging in this behaviour you disagree with - it's a capitalist corporation and you blame it on their ""lefty"" employees?

I know it's easy to say, but don't rely on the JC to find you 'preferred' work - however many forms and applications you fill out - do as many more again in your own time, and physically knock on business doors just to get any work.   Then think again and keep looking for what you want. 

Don't think that you're going to shine through because you're more qualified and willing if they're sending you out in a tsunami of JC candidates.  Their vetting is abysmal and it is just as likely that they won't see the one good tree in a forest of mediocrity and unsuitability the JC sends to their door.  As much as it might be utterly demoralising to be looking for work, especially when already out of work, hiring is no picnic either.  If there's still those Internet recruitment sites like Monster; forget them too unless they're specialised.  Crap!  They spam the hell out of recruiters, and then some.   

Trust your own initiative and footwork above anybody that works at the JC, and spend an extra day at private recruitment offices.

I know 100 signatures isn't much but I wanted to gauge the level of support rather than strike out with a too-ambitious number. My experience has been that it doesn't take very much targeted effort to get a company to give in, it's sort of like that rule of complaints where the BBC assumes 1000 people would be annoyed but not actually write in for every complaint they do get (don't quote on me that, but I've heard it said). I would normally go through one of the bigger intern rights groups as they have more clout, but they are really busy at the moment so I thought I'd try this.

Also, I completely agree that just getting exposure for the issue is really important - the petition is also a point around which the discussion starts. I've been surprised at how many people I know who aren't aware that many unpaid internships are illegal, and that there is any law in place at all! Companies are taking advantage of this, so the more people know the better, and the more the authorities will creak into action to avoid getting nagged by the public about not enforcing the law. 

A boycott would be brilliant, and you might be right that I should have made that the focus of the petition - but some people are independently saying that in their comments anyway, and all the signature comments get emailed straight to Urban Outfitters, so it might point that way anyway.

The problems atheism faces are firstly that religion occupies such a huge portion of culture and society that removing it in an instant is a completely unrealistic goal; this as a result makes a confrontational approach counter-productive as a more gradual erosion and replacement of religions place in modern society is required. Secondly, many people who would certainly not view themselves as religious would also not view themselves as atheists; they therefore see the confrontational approach as disrespectful to those of faith.

They do speak out a lot, like they did a last month against payday lenders, however for everything they've got *right* there are also non-Christian organisations doing the exact same thing. Morality derived from scripture and the CoE is ultimately superfluous I think. Evidently fewer people are accepting Anglicanism and as that continues we'll no doubt move to other moral authorities, secular or otherwise (and perhaps a less hierarchical debate).  

Generally I think religious organisations are pretty poor moral authorities anyway. It's very hard to argue against someone if you don't agree on the same premise. Often justifications are similar to ""X is wrong because it says so in Romans"", or whatever. As someone who doesn't accept those books as true I can't argue against their morality. All I can say is that I don't accept those books as true, and perhaps that they shouldn't either.

There will also be a percentage to official travel packages through Thomas Cook and other outlets.

After that, tickets may go on sale to season ticket holders - in the past the box office has only sold to those who provide details of their travel arrangements.

I'm not saying that it is impossible, but I want to set your expectations that it may not be simple.

* 1. Parker can't pass at all and other than defensively, doesn't have much of what I call a ""footballing brain"" - He doesn't know where to look for a pass, when to run v.s. when to lay it off and his positioning going forward is poor (he often gets in other player's way). Compare this to Huddlestone, who is the best passer in our squad, bar none. He always knows when to spread play and when to hold the ball, which he does well. He doesn't panic on the ball (unlike Parker)
* 2. He is much more of a physical presence, both in terms of height and strength than Parker is. He can out-muscle people, much like Sandro can. 
* 3. I actually think he's got better positional awareness both going forward and defensively. He's played at centre back and as a defensive midfielder for us in the past when we've needed him (When King + Dawson were injured etc.) And he displayed his ability to defend last night too after the departure of Jan. I reckon Gallas or Caulker would have crumbled where Dawson and Huddlestone were strong and composed. 
* 4. If you're going to use age as a factor, Huddlestone is 26, Parker is 32 going on 33 at the start of next season. Not only will he not improve, but will likely get worse, as he will lose even more pace, and just be generally less fit (further exposing us when he's out of position) 
* 5. I find it laughable that anyone considers Livermore more than just Jenas Version 2.0. Honestly, Every time I see him play he exemplifies everything I disliked about Jenas - almost always passing backwards, always having his head down when he does move forward, mediocre distribution - but in a younger, better looking form. He's not bad, but he's not worthy of being in the squad of a top-6 team. I'm sure Villa or Fulham etc. would like to have him as a squad player, but not for us, even if he is just 23, Carroll is just better in every way, and is younger.

true,Feyle,null,null,"&gt;I was actually probing into your theory as to how funeral protests could effect change, as the original question showed. But I guess it would be too much to expect you to manage that level of complexity. 

If you were ""actually"" doing this then you shouldn't have pretended not to know how protests effect change.

&gt;then they aren't justified. 

This comes back to your initial blanket statement. Are you admitting by this that if a funeral protest did effect change that it would be moral?

&gt;stop avoiding and answer the question, otherwise explain what is wrong with my point. 

Restate your question without misrepresenting my position and I will.

&gt;you have said funeral protests can be justifiable because protests can be justifiable.

No, I didn't.

&gt; but you haven't provided evidence or a reason for this; it's essentially a non sequitur. no one is arguing with you about the justification of protest. 

It's your non sequitur because it's not something that I've stated.


Let me try and simplify this so that you don't continue to state that I said things which I haven't or argue against positions which I haven't put forward:

1.  You asked the question: Is picketing a funeral wrong?

2. I responded: not in all cases.

3. You asked for an example as you said you couldn't think of a single way it could ever not be wrong.

4. I gave the hypothetical: if the protest secured equal rights

5. You asked me to give evidence that a funeral protest would do this.

Answer this question: Do you agree that a funeral protest that secured equal rights would not be wrong?

Firstly, you appear to be *assuming* that the guilty members of management ""tend towards liberal politics"". You're probably doing this based on the way they or the industry appears, not after going out and doing a survey and establishing actually how the members of this group (or the *responsible* members of the group) identify or vote.

Politics should always be based on facts, not feels - things you can measure, not just things you think because of where you grew up or what your family do or think.

I would say it doesn't matter that these creatives *look* lefty or liberal, it's their actions that speak louder than words. I think they're more likely to be really ""former liberals"" by the time they've moved to London and succeeded in a career with a multinational but, still, I don't think the label matters. 

I also find it ironic that you appear to be saying ""look at these hypocritical liberals on the left"" when you're undertaking socialist activism yourself. You're complaining about a large powerful company exploiting its workers and breaking employee-protection laws. You're trying to organise collective action to see that the ""proletariat"" are treated fairly. Surely this is unionism, by any other name? Surely these are traditionally socialist activities, and a century ago you would have been called an agitator and a rabble-rouser for what you're doing. 

So surely, as a socialist worker yourself (winking emoticon), you should be saying ""look at those bad liberals on the right""? Isn't socialism (for what these labels are worth) on the left of liberalism?

Secondly, flippant throw-away comments are divisive, and that's the real problem here. Our democratic system is broken because it has become all about ""my party is better than your party"" and ""look what those guys all did wrong"".

I appreciate it's tempting to score political points when you see the opportunity - I'm sure I've done it myself. But every time you do that, you contribute to the us-and-them mentality - you make the other guy want to get back at you, to score points in turn. This doesn't get us anywhere - it's a divide and rule tactic that's actively harmful to the wellbeing of our society.

The goal of politics should be *consensus*. We should be saying ""I believe Y because X, here's the proof. Because of this, I want Z. What do you believe? Ok, if you can't give me Z, what can you give me? What is the middle ground upon which we can compromise?"" Every time we say ""you lefties"" or ""evil tories"" we make that harder to achieve.

here's where your logic breaks down; this is an unsupported hypothetical with no reason to suppose or believe such a thing is likely or even possible. This is demonstrated by the fact that you cannot show how a funeral protest could ever secure equal rights.

I feel that some of that trust in the party will now be gone and we'll slip back into being a Conservative stronghold (Labour don't even have a look in here, with only 5-10% of the vote in recent elections and they have historically never held this constituency). However there may be other constituencies they can win off the Lib Dem's betrayal, alongside those swing constituencies that are currently held by the Conservatives.

The only way they can hope to do this is if they come up with some effective policies and prove that Ed can be a leader (which frankly I'm not convinced about, David would've been a much easier sell), rather than hoping on a protest vote against the coalition. The reality is that even if the protest vote does work in their favour the victory won't last without effective policies and strong leadership.

So, in order.  If the split happens a transitional period would begin where handovers would occur, it wont just be the vote one day and then as soon as the results are announced we're gone.

Because Scotland has so much influence now?  Considering that the Scottish vote has never made the difference in a UK election, if you removed Scotland the same parties would have won every election, the will of the Scottish people is totally trampled by England, which is fine, there are more of you, but the people of Scotland should consider their own autonomy far more important than whether or not we have a seat at a pointless body.

I was also a developer before I learned, so that probably helped. I still think a crash course in 2 weeks will be enough though.

With that said, I work as a developer in an agency now and 2 weeks definitely won't be enough for more advanced designs, or for JavaScript.

JS is a massive plus rather than a requirement, a bit like icing on the cake. It's also fairly complicated. For most things like sliders and basic stuff like that, there'll be plugins that can help by literally copying and pasting. Not the most professional, but plenty of businesses are carried by just searching for JS plugins on the web, and they charge London rates!

Regarding work pipelines, I don't freelance anymore so I don't really know. When I was younger I used to take up people's requests on SitePoint and DigitalPoint, as well as taking on work from CSSSG. But when I did, the business was quite easy to come by, and as long as you conduct yourself well and do a good job, clients are very easy to develop a relationship with.

Ultimately my advice for you would be to invest some time in to learning some HTML/CSS as with that knowledge you'll have some basic skills for editing websites that you might stumble in to in your job (every company has a website now), or your own personal one.

* The UK would retain its permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Scotland would, like most of the other countries in the world, not.
* The Faslane base would remain Scottish, however the nuclear weapons based there would be moved to somewhere else in the UK. Where they go is really up to rUK.
* The national debt, like the national assets, would be split. By population would be the simplest starting point but there would obviously be some horse-trading: if Scotland does not want some of their portion of the UK's assets, those could be traded off against a reduction in the debt.

For example seasonal farm workers. *Employees* are people with set hours and the expectation of on going employment, like most jobs.

Workers don't get maternity/paternity *leave*, don't get redundancy pay and can be dismissed for any reason. **Both** are protected by all the other employee rights like Minimum wage, rest breaks, maximum working hours, sick pay etc.  *Self Employed* is the only category that doesn't require minimum wage, because they are acting as a business and are free to negotiate contracts as they see fit.

**Importantly** the employer does **not** get to decide which category you fall into, that is up to HMRC inspectors. There are no hard rules for how you sort someone in their category but there is a general list of things that push you one way or t'other and it's treated on a case by case basis. Lots of companies hire people and just tell them they are self employed to get out of PAYE/SickPay/Insurance/Other obligations. HMRC *really* does not like this.

Hiring a full time employee can incur 40%-50% of their salary extra in various legal requirements and that's before you have to buy them any equipment to get the job done. So even if a self employed guy is 50% more expensive per hour for the same job it works out cheaper and frees you from a massive pile of paperwork and obligations.

&gt; Just look at how much money goes from the Arts Fund to posh kids' pet projects. 

Anecdata doesn't build sturdy bridges, but your acquaintance doesn't sound very ""lefty"" to me.

I mean, I know I'm sounding a bit scottish here - no *true* socialist - but it sounds like your acquaintance's ""impeccable liberal credentials"" might be that she's a member of the labour party, in which case you've just told me she's a small-t tory instead of a capital-T one. [The labour party haven't been ""properly"" left wing since 1995](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause_IV#Blair.27s_fight), and their ""social democratic"" credibility is rather weak, too.

As I said in my other comment, don't allow this to become about the ""left wing"" and ""liberal"" labels. Anyone can call themselves a ""lefty"", and I certainly wouldn't ""let them off"" just because they've appropriated the term.

I can't address how your acquaintance has misspent public money, but you can - socialism starts with every one of us, comrade. You can write to the Arts Fund and complain that they funded an event which offered no meaningful discount for the unwashed.

You may be able to submit freedom-of-information requests asking how the money was spent, whether the event was audited or asking for a copy of the funding application. You can tell the Arts Fund that the cost of hiring the room was £1000, piano rental is £500 and how, on top of their grant, the necessity of charging admission doesn't make sense. 

Personally, I have entrepreneurial leanings, and I think there may be room for promoters to make a fair wage (or ""profit"") from organising publicly-funded events. I'm not the guy to speak to about the value of classical orchestras vs. beginner guitar workshops for underprivileged kids, because this isn't my specialist subject. A quick google does suggest, however, that [The Art Fund](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_Fund) ""relies on members' subscriptions and public donations for funds and does not receive funding from the government or the National Lottery"".

Um, the SNP were democratically elected and got a majority. They're also holding a *referendum* on independence. That's as democratic as you can get!

&gt;Do you think that if the issue of total autonomy would have been that pressing for Scots it'd have come around sooner than 300+ years.

Um, it has come up a lot. It's taken 300+ years to finally get to a point where enough of the population want it, and the UK government is in a weak enough position, to actually let us have a chance at it, though. You realise the Act of Union wasn't exactly popular, right? Scotland wasn't just broke, we also had to be bribed. Scotland was, of course, not a democracy at this point. Neither was the UK. In fact, the UK has only been a democracy proper since the late 1800s, and even then, you had to hold property to vote until 1918. This probably has had an effect on how much the UK government has considered independence.

It's on that website.

I have made a mistake though. Major got less voter share by percentage (a little less than Thatcher achieved), but on a larger voter turnout equating to more votes.

&gt; But John Major, always underestimated by a sneering metropolitan media class, triumphed against the odds.

&gt;He won more votes – 14 million – than any other British prime minister has ever done. In popular terms, the margin of victory was immense. No less than 42 per cent of the voters came out for Major, 34 per cent for Kinnock. But the bias of the British electoral system hit the Conservatives hard.

Edit: There is this from the BBC website

&gt; Three months later, in the aftermath of the Gulf War, he had become the most popular prime minister in 30 years.

This is obviously a small component of the masses but it does tread on any notion of a melting pot. Angela Merkel said that Turkish in starting new lives in Germany have not worked well as they do not mix well with the population, perhaps this is what breeds skepticism? 

The thing is people like to think of themselves as having a national identity which we would equate with being British or 'Britishness', and if any biased media outfit looking for a few shock reads wants to play on the lower mindsets of people and feign some sort of intellectual clarity by quoting Enoch Powell then let them. But then again despite our country being built on it, their is quite a large percentage of people coming in, numbers which have seldom been seen previously and perhaps there is a need for some form of regulation.

I'm of Scottish and French descent originally but there is a kind of romantic notion in looking back at Britain with a kind of Ealing Comedy aesthetic and why shouldn't we? There is a lot of beauty to be had if you look for it and as we evolve some elements we appreciate die out and are replaced. And we would quite likely equate these with a growing foreign population to contrive an easy solution to it. 

I would also put it down to the 7/7 bombings and the flames of fear being fanned constantly in our directions, and the stereotypes that were then readily available to tar Islamic communities with. As i'm typing this it seems that idle minds don't seem well catered for and the minority seem to spoil it for the majority, just because there is an EDL doesn't mean we all want to spit on a mosque same as we don't believe every Muslim wants Sharia to adhered to en mass.

You can read his ""pledge"" [here](http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/why-we-can-ban-nuclear-weapons-and-stay-in-nato.19134185). It seems reasonable to me, although his certainty may be tested.

Then again, perhaps not. There are only five countries who actually host nuclear weapons for NATO, and most have campaigned to have them removed. The weapons themselves are much less sophisticated than Trident, and are essentially free-fall bombs rather than guided missiles.

So perhaps he is simply calculating that the likelihood of having anything new installed in Scotland is negligible, and we might as well swear allegiance to the ""nuclear weapons are a core component"" pledge. Particularly given that some people believe that NATO's ""nuclear umbrella"" policy violates the NPT, so it seems very unlikely that a country could be compelled to host them if it did not chose to do so.

Blair certainly re-invented Labour, but not to the point where they inspired and united the electorate. He just made them credible and acceptable to swing voters, and that was enough to oust a government that by '97 was widely despised.

The relevance of all this? Well, Milliband's arguably trying the same thing. He's simply banking on the coalition being so unpopular by the next election that he'll win as long as he turns up.

If they played it, they'd be safe in the knowledge that they were simply fulfilling the brief of their program. It's a bloody chart show, where they're meant to play songs in the charts.

The fact that they've refused to play it means they've got no legs to stand on. At all. They've made an editorial decision based on politics, that is not impartial. In fact, if they had decided to play it based on those same reasons, it would not be impartial.

They should have played it based on the program's brief. That would have been thoroughly impartial, and anyone complaining could have easily had that explained to them. Instead they've chosen to let opinions guide them. And there's no coming back from that. No excuse at all. It doesn't matter if the majority share the opinion they were guided by, I bet the vast majority of people would still argue that they should have played it.

I've said it before and I'll say it again. The BBC really need to get their whole impartiality philosophy defined properly.
