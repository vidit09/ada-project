Then it's just a case of trawling through to find what you want.

Outside of sale season, subscribe to emails from your favourite shops and a few voucher codes websites to get the best deal you can, and, if course, just google voucher code and the name of the shop.

3. This idea that he would come to Chelsea and net 15+ goals in the PL is just rediculous since he wasn't even able to get top scorer in the Russian Leagues (a league with much lower standards that the PL I might add), he actually finished behind 4 or 5 players that most of you probably haven't even heard of

4. Finally, and this is where the controversy may come in, I want Rooney. He is an amazing player. Easily could fit into our team. Wages are less and really we are getting more bang for our buck. We need a striker, lukaku isn't ready yet (as seen in our game against RM, where to me it seemed he was having a hard time keeping up) and Torres and Ba aren't quite up to par.

The FFP rules actually don't present a huge hurdle for a team to spend money from within if i recall correctly, there are loopholes that teams can use, it does make it more difficult but not impossible though.  I think in FFP a stadium cost may be slightly negated if handled properly but things like the training ground or club offices can't (which is why it was a big deal that we got our new one done prior to the FFP coming in).  If Levy/Lewis were to move on i would worry about a Liverpool situation, but i think we all would because it could either break like Liverpool or Man City with a new owner.

Regardless it is worth the effort of Lewis/Levy to improve the team now and build the brand as that will have 2 effects...improve a potential sale value and increase revenue making FFP easier to abide by.",0,1376509182,null,0,false,0,cbnr18u,t3_1kczsf,t1_cbnr18u,t1_cbnpl9k,null,1429829555,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Sure we lost (to Wigan...) and lost out on a repeat (damn Reds), but surely we should be content, considering our previous history in the third division.

I would argue that the club didn't deserve to finish as high as we did last year. Watching every game, you saw the holes. We weren't playing our best and just coming up short. We looked listless, disorganized, uninspired, and I'd argue that we should have finished far lower in the table.

Consider the 2-2 draws versus Liverpool as prime examples. In both matches we were outplayed and only thanks to some seriously foolish errors and supremely amazing shots (Aguero again), we eked out a point.

A City supporter will tell you that they've experienced the ups and downs. The incredible highs and lowest of lows. I'm relatively new to the club, so I can't speak to the glory days of old or even the dark times of more recent. But we don't ignore the dubious past, we embrace it. I think that, combined with the supporters' and club's dedication to giving back to their communities, is what makes City so special. 

All we ask in return for this undying support is our players to give their all for the badge. Our beloved Zaba has become such a legend because he personifies ""Pride in Battle,"" always pushing the pace, giving his all on the pitch.

The disappointment we felt last year was because we saw players taking matches off, not giving their all. That's inexcusable. With a new manager and new players, as well as some key departures of some elements that caused tension, it seems like the club is ready to embrace what made us nigh-unstoppable a few years ago: the fighting spirit.

true,kopking08,null,null,"Alberto seems to me to be a deeper lying CAM. So he plays a bit further back than Coutinho. He's also, as Rodgers and the player himself has said, versatile. He has good vision all around the pitch. So even if out wide he's not beating people down the line, he's still making smart plays. 

Its obvious that, for the money we put on him, we think he's going to be a talent. You don't shell out this kind of money on an unproven player (which, despite his stats is BBVA or whatever the La Liga lower league is, he is) unless you've got some confidence in his ""fit"".

I hardly think Rodgers would have bought him if he didn't have a role in mind.

Suso, on the other hand, is sort of in a tough position and may never cut it in the Premier League. He's an incredibly talented player in my mind. But he just doesn't seem to have the strength to play in his most natural position (where Gerrard is right now). If he can adapt to being a full time wide man I can see his use for us long term.

Otherwise, in a lot of ways, I think our loaning him to a Spanish side this season suggests we may be hoping to sell him to one next season.

EDIT: I should say Suso may not cut it in our team in the Premier League. The way Rodgers has us built at the moment doesn't really allow both the CAM and CM to be softies. If Kelly took over as RB and we got a more stationary LB I could see how we could feel safe with two relatively weak defensive players in the center of the pitch.

Unfortunately the closest comparison I can see is Algeria in the 90's. The military staged a coup to 'save democracy from itself' when it looked like the Islamists were about to win an election. The Islamists then took this as a cue that they were never going to win if they played the political game, and started a campaign of kidnapping, assassinations and terror that lasted the best part of a decade.

Your words not mine, is there an Arsenal forward better than him? I would say no, No football fan would argue there are two, therefore hes going to start. Therefore he enhances Arsenal.

That isnt even an argument I dont even think as a point it would usually need to be made.

Look at it this way, Arsene Wenger is one of the shrewdest operators in the transfer market, probably to a fault.

You're saying hes bringing in Suarez for 40mil for what? his renowned charming personality and tea making capabilities?

Lets assume hes poison or trouble in the dressing room ok weigh that up versus the fear hes strikes in opposition defenders and goals scored? 

This is football its cold ruthless and there is no room for sentiment. Use Suarez all we can then dispose of him.

Sterling has just been taken to court for common assault against a woman. Our captain once assaulted a man in a club for turning off his favourite Phil Collins track. Lets get them out too.

They are a group that consists of a large majority of uneducated laborers and c,d class and below members of society. But they also contain doctors, lawyers, pediatricians etc. Jobs your mother would want you getting married too. This image is unsustainable to rational people. 
 
Public opinion is turning (albeit slowly) to see the inept crooks they really are. This is my major gripe with them, that that are inept. I can understand a banker who embezzles millions, a lawyer who uses cunning wit but these guys? They can only fool a crowd of beggars with rice and sugar.

There is also two issues with the way cycling deaths vs usage are measured. Do you mesure by time on a bike, or distance? Both give very different results.

2: I stand by my comment, and the article backs that up. It's common knowledge I think that each year road deaths drop. But there is no doubt that there are more cars on the road.

I still like him a lot, but it kind of made me see him a little bit more objectively rather than just as this adorable, pink and fluffy national treasure.

The thing that bothered me most was the overwhelming piety that permeated the whole performance. He kept mentioning how great the free fringe was and therefore how great he was to be doing a free show and how grateful we all should be to get to see him for free.

true,philipwhiuk,null,null,"A union is not much of a hierarchy. You pay the subs, you get represented and they help with stuff (which can be legal disputes, pay disputes, etc, etc).

Having said that, it's only worth being in a union if there's at least a few of you at your employer. The subs probably don't stack up otherwise.

It's also worth looking at what the different unions do and how they work. For example, there's a fair few teachers unions and they have fairly different attitudes towards solving their members problems. Some will ballot a strike more readily than others (not necessarily a good thing).

The rough structure looks like the following:

Leader - Executive - Union Representative (or 'shop steward') - You

Most of this is based on my Dad's retelling of his experiences as a union rep. AFAIK he never went on strike, but achieved a lot for the people in the union (and some outside) in terms of helping them with issues and problems.

true,smoshuap0wers,1972crest,,"Starting with the boss: I think Pelligrini is the missing piece of the puzzle. Going back to Mancini briefly, that man got us well on our way, and nearly everyone was devastated and quite shocked by his sacking. He had a fantastic tenure and it's going to be difficult on Monday to see a new man in his seat, but at the same time, Bobby seemed to be going stale and seemed horridly short of ideas all season. On the other hand, Pellegrini is someone who always seems to have a plan. I'm not going to sit here and tell you I've seen his teams play, but his record speaks for itself and he clearly studies teams and sets his players up accordingly; not just relying on sheer individual brilliance. Also, seemingly a fantastic man manager. To publicly come out and support Dzeko (a player seemingly on his way out) was a stroke of genius. He's also reassured Lescott of game time meaning we've got a respectable CB sitting in the wings, eager to play. Not to mention his belief in youth, giving both Boyata and Guidetti much deserved support in the pre-season: these two should seem some good minutes this year. Personally, I'm just very excited to see what this clever man can achieve. Finally, this quote, while arguably quite rich for City, is why I'm most excited about MP (re: Madrid, but can be applied to City): ""I didn't have a voice or a vote at Madrid. They sign the best players, but not the best players needed in a certain position. It’s no good having an orchestra with the 10 best guitarists if I don’t have a pianist. Real Madrid have the best guitarists, but if I ask them to play the piano they won’t be able to do it so well. He [Pérez] sold players that I considered important. We didn't win the Champions League because we didn't have a squad properly structured to be able to win it.""

Players: I'm personally mostly excited about seeing Dzeko (hopefully) in full beast mode. The boy didn't seem to give a toss last year and people were soo pissed with his work rate. Personally, I think he didn't like playing under Bobby and lacked confidence. If he can play the role he's meant to play (and not have to come deep for little tippy-tappy passes, leave that to aguero and jovetic) then he's a 25-30 goals a season striker; dual-footed, powerful in the air, strong on the ball and a great sixth sense. It's just a shame about his first touch!

Secondly I'm delighted to see Navas. We've seriously lacked an out and out winger for years now and his pace is astonishing! He reminds me a lot of pre-2005 SWP, but he does lack an end-product. If he's left to cause havoc on the wing and not cut in, then he'll be a deadly weapon crossing to Dzeko and Negredo.

The whole team looks so fluid up front this season. Pretty much all of our attacking talent are interchangeable bar the 2 big men up top and Jesus. The likes of Fernandinho and Yaya will be vital in midfield and those two working together will be a dream. Fernandinho will break the play up, and release The Toure. Yaya will be a goal scoring midfielder with the licence to roam into the box, similar to classic Lampard. Fernandinho will do the work Yaya has never been arsed to.

As for players out: Gareth Barry (so sad, he's a brilliant reader of the game and I would be so happy to see him retire at City) and Scott Sinclair.

Also, Aguero had an injury-stricken season and could be used more sparingly this term. No doubt he'll still back his 15-20, however!

I mean, there were times last season at which I was genuinely amazed at how far forward Enrique would go and how he and Downing (that's just the case I remember vividly) worked together, they were imo, an excellent attacking force on that wing when they were both on form.

That's kind of irrelevant though, 'cause if these two are at the same level (as many are saying) then we're fine. A defender who pushes very far forward but leaves gaps at times (Enrique) who can be subbed/replaced by Siqueira when the situation calls for a stronger defense than attack can only be a good thing. Add in to that the fact that Johnson is brilliant on the left and can be replaced by Andre Wisdom (who I feel should be starting for us) at RB and we'll be left with 3 LBs and 3 (almost 4) RBs (Johnson, Wisdom, Kelly and if push came to shove Hendo) and we'll have a good, varied defense with lots of players fighting to make the first team.

I couldn't have replied better myself. Why the fuck are kids playing on the road, you ask?

Apparently outdoor play is at an all-time low for British children. Can you seriously just shrug off the fact that they're not safe outside their own houses?  
I would sooner live on a low-traffic street with opportunities for everybody to enjoy it safely than a 'rat run'. But the thing is, the worst 'rat runs' are a tragic accident of 20^th century infrastructure planning, no more. There was a time not long ago when roads weren't dangerous places to stand. On residential streets, we should send traffic elsewhere to take that back again.

&gt;I would like to ask what about the effects of traffic displacement. If ten cars are moved from a minor road to a main road, that is an increase in density on the main road. Multiply that across a reasonable sized town on mainroads already at full capacity...

You are absolutely correct. The trouble with all roadbuilding projects is 'induced traffic' - when everyone sees how much nicer the new, empty motorway is to travel on, they all jump in their cars to enjoy the superiority over public transport. But pretty soon, the new road is then just as congested as everywhere else, and you're back to square one. It took our politicians most of the 20^th century to realise that this is a huge and very real problem - it's why Blair stopped major roadbuilding in 1997. The more roads there are, the more traffic appears on them.

What we are aiming for is exactly what you describe - the opposite effect. Induce arterial traffic jams by preventing cut-throughs, and behold, half the drivers in the queue suddenly reconsider whether they really *need* to drive each morning. Traffic in towns doesn't deserve any love or encouragement. It ruins everything.

Through-motor traffic can simply fuck off on residential roads, frankly. Your desire to commute in a private car and shortcut clogged arterial routes does not overrule my right to not be bullied away from the public space outside my home, just as I don't have the right to rev a chainsaw mindlessly outside your window all day. Anyone trying to avoid a traffic jam is just part of the problem. Restrict through traffic, slow it the fuck down, and keep it to arterial routes and not cutthroughs - and let the people enjoy their streets.",0,1376522060,null,0,1376524292,0,cbnw65n,t3_1kc4xk,t1_cbnw65n,t1_cbno2tg,null,1429827159,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Look, I'll be clear here I AM an actual Atheist in pretty much the same way Iain M. Banks was (95% Atheist 5% Agnostic because you've got to keep an open mind about this).  

But Christ on a bike some of the younger people we've allowed on to the internet are really getting my goat up, religion isn't the root of all evil and when you get the Pope (the actual Pope, not the Space Pope the one that is the head of the Catholic church) saying ""Yeah, evolution is a thing"" you've got to take a step back and actually look at this with a critical eye. 

A LOT of information we have about the early civilisations survives because religious orders thought it was worth preserving, so they did. For centuries. Painstakingly refreshing and re-illuminating manuscripts, a lot of the very basic math we take for granted came from people who held a firm belief in the divine.

So when the BBC post a very minor puff piece that a load of pubs are closing down in Blackburn and that these buildings are being re-tasked to become places of worship for various religions (Mosques, Synagogs, Chruches) and community centres I don't honestly have a problem with it because as the community changes so do those buildings... and it's rather pointless to moan that a Muslim doesn't fancy spending the day in a pub... drinking alcohol!

Yet apparently I should because 'evil religion' according to someone who probably hasn't even finished their education yet and has learned everything they think they need to know from the echo chamber of internet forums.  

Guy's religion isn't a problem.  ZEALOTS are.  The people who take it to extremes and feel the need to ram their personal belief system down everyone's throats.   Be their Muslim, Christian, Catholic, Buddhist or indeed Atheist. 

That you thought it would be a good idea to ram YOUR atheism down the throat of someone not sat there beating the ""God doesn't exist lulz"" drum as hard as they could shows that you aren't no different to any other religious extremist.  Just because I personally do not feel the need to ram something down the throat of others doesn't make me any less of something than you. 

In fact it probably makes me a better atheist.  I'm the one with the open mind! ",0,1376522883,null,0,false,0,cbnwgp0,t3_1kcf0y,t1_cbnwgp0,t1_cbnr77u,null,1429827023,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Luis Suárez is set to hold urgent talks with Brendan Rodgers in the next 24 hours after another day of claim and counter-claim about the forward’s future.
Suárez is due to return to Merseyside today after playing in Uruguay’s 4-2 win over Japan in Miyagi and he will immediately begin discussions with the Liverpool manager.
Top of the agenda will be comments attributed to Suárez that emerged in Uruguay yesterday, in which he was reported to have said that he is willing to remain at Liverpool. “For now, due to all of the people’s affection [for me], I will be staying,” the 26-year-old said according to El Observador, the Uruguayan newspaper.
Suárez’s camp, though, dispute that he made the comments and Liverpool are yet to receive any indication from the Uruguay forward that he is ready to shelve plans to quit.
“I didn’t say that, maybe someone else did. The main thing is that I am here with the national team,” Kyodo News, a Japanese agency, later quoted Suárez as saying. With the situation becoming increasingly complex, Rodgers feels the need to ascertain exactly what Suárez’s position is and whether he is in the right frame of mind to return to training after being ordered to train alone.
Key to the talks will be Suárez’s relationship with his manager, which has deteriorated sharply as a result of the acrimony stemming from the former Ajax player agitating for a transfer.
Rodgers wants Suárez to apologise for his behaviour before he is willing to reintegrate him into the Liverpool squad. Suárez, though, maintains that there is no reason to show any contrition and is not prepared to retract his claim that Rodgers promised him he could leave in the event of Liverpool failing to qualify for the Champions League and a rival club making an offer in excess of £40 million for his services.
With Suárez apparently unwilling to back down, the impasse could continue unless Rodgers decides to judge him on his commitment and attitude rather than making an apology the decisive factor.
There is a growing realisation in the Suárez camp that remaining at Liverpool is the most likely outcome, particularly after the intervention of John W. Henry, the club’s principal owner, who made it clear last week that he will not countenance a transfer.
Since then, there has been a softening in Suárez’s attitude that has coincided with Arsenal considering alternative transfer targets — two developments that have increased Liverpool’s confidence that they will be able to prevent their top scorer of last season from leaving.
Liverpool’s pursuit of Willian is down to Rodgers’s vision of the Anzhi Makhachkala winger operating in an attacking quartet featuring Suárez, Philippe Coutinho and Daniel Sturridge. There is no suggestion that the Brazil player would replace Suárez.
Anzhi are understood to be seeking a fee of more than £30 million for Willian, who is also attracting interest from Tottenham Hotspur, but Liverpool are yet to be put off by the financial requirements of completing such an ambitious deal.
At this stage, Liverpool have made only an inquiry but there is no need as yet for them to make a formal offer for the 25-year-old as Anzhi have allowed Willian to try to set up a move, having made their entire first-team squad available for transfer as the Russian club attempt to cut costs dramatically.
Liverpool have been heartened by the emergence of a recent interview in which Willian revealed that he “would jump at the chance to play for them”. They also hope that if they are able to sign the former Shakhtar Donetsk player, it would help to convince Suárez of their ambition.
Ian Ayre, the Liverpool managing director, was involved in negotiations with Granada yesterday to try to strike a deal for Guilherme Siqueira, the Brazilian.

true,P0nyHawk,null,null,"I'm on my computer now so here is a bit of what I know. 

Swansea was the only welsh club in the league until this season (Cardiff gained promotion after a very impressive season in the Championship). Although I have watched the Swans since I can remember, I have only started following the team more when they were promoted. 

As for promotion, that happened in the play-off final at Wembley three seasons ago. It was a 4-2 win over Reading (who were promoted last season but relegated again) with Scott Sinclair scoring a hat trick and Stephen Dobbie scoring one. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQkXtw7vucI) are the highlights of that game. Sinclair left the club after one season in the Premier League to go to Manchester City where he found himself sitting on the bench and without any trophies yet. Obviously City is a much bigger team than Swansea but with the team they've got, there isn't a place for him. The first season in the Premier League was very impressive considering that everyone outside of the club was expecting them to be relegated. They finished in 11th which isn't as bad as it sounds when you look at the league. Also a lot of teams don't survive first seasons so to go above and beyond to finish halfway up the table isn't bad. Some big wins that season were Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City. Swansea also brought in some players that season like our current keeper, Michel Vorm.

The second season in the Premier League was even better finishing 9th in the league and winning the league cup against Bradford City 5-0. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZj17x1VAH8) are highlights of that game. The second season also saw us bring in a new manager, Michael Laudrup as Brendan Rogers went to Liverpool. Laudrup brought in some players too including, Pablo Hernandez, Ki, Chico Flores and of course Michu. Michu scored 2 goals in his début in a 5-0 win over QPR on the opening day of the season. No one knew who Michu was until he joined Swansea but they should've considering he was the highest scoring midfielder in La Liga (Spain). He was bought for a mere £2 million. He signed an extension on his contract only a few weeks into the season to ensure he stays at Swansea (Although it really just raises his value, not his time at the club). He was purchased to play in the gap behind the striker but was usually played as the striker. Our striker at the time was Danny Graham who was a good goal scorer but didn't compare to Michu. He left the club during the winter transfer window to go to Hull. Swansea went the rest of the season without a true striker which did hurt us at times when we struggled to finish chances and relied on Michu too much. He scored 22 goals in all competitions last season (League, League Cup and FA Cup). After winning the League Cup we really did struggle to find any points but there was never any worry of relegation, just what place we would finish. The season came to a disappointing ending with a 3-0 loss to Fulham in a game which we dominated shots and possession but mistakes and lack of finishing resulted in a loss. But any fan will say that it was an amazing season and was also the Centenary season for us. The League cup was also the first piece of silverware in club history. 

As for this season (which begins on the 17th), it is looking promising as the squad has been given a huge upgrade by bringing in lots of players. Wilfried Bony was brought for a club record of £12 million. Many other midfielders were brought in and some defenders. Winning the League Cup put us into Europa League which will mean we will have a lot of games this season depending how far we go in each competition. So far we haven't lost any of our key players which is great for the squad. Pre season went extremely well with only 1 goal against and no losses. The two games in Europa League went well too with a 4-0 win over Malmo at home and then a 0-0 draw to Malmo away. 

I know I didn't get everything but I hope someone else can help me out. As a supporter of the Whitecaps in the MLS, I have to say things are a lot different in the BPL. There are no playoffs, but there are relegations to the Championship. Your place in the table after the final game of the season also decides how much money the club will receive (I believe). A top 4 finish qualifies you for Champions League and a 5th place finish qualifies you for Europa League. Wigan (Who were just relegated) also qualified for the Europa League by defeating Manchester City in the FA cup final thus the lack of trophies this season for the team and for Scott Sinclair!

Tot'num and Arsenal aren't able to overtake the Blue wave in West London and as a result those two clubs are upset.  As for the Manchester clubs?

He doesn't really want to be the number 9, and loves to drift out either to the left or to to the right to get behind the defense and get shots off. The main difference being Ronaldo would rather drift left to cut on to his right foot and bale would rather drift right to cut on to his left. He may not have the trickery of Ronaldo, but this almost makes him more effective because he spends less time trying to bewilder opponents with moves and instead just opts to blow past them with a dip of the shoulder. Bale would (will) make any team in the world better, including Madrid, simply because he has the ability to split a defense and score goals without any assistance. That is the aspect that he shares most with Ronaldo. That is also the reason I'm not certain Madrid really need him at the moment, because he would displace players who are there to accentuate Ronaldo's already immeasurable skill I.E. Di Maria (the crosser), Benzema (the fox in the box), or even a CAM like Ozil or Modric who provide Ronaldo with excellent service.

TL;DR He's a left footed young Ronaldo, minus the tricks. Madrid doesn't need another Ronaldo, because their squad is built on making Ronaldo the best he can be.

I submit to you that the chameleon helmet doesn't literally re-write their biology and tear out one of their hearts to make them human, but actually creates a painful process that removes their memories from the consciense mind and converts them into data, then placing the data into the fob-watch. This would explain why The Doctor expierenced the pain of 'turning' human, and perhaps the mind can easily convert familiar memories back into data on it's own, but not the opposite. If this is ture, then a human can never really become time-lord or regenerate. Also, it is mentioned in several of the classics that regenerations sets are only recieved once in a set of 12, and that it must be recieved by the president Rassilon or one of his representatives.

Everyone over-analyzes during the off season and forgets the fact that we started to play some *really* beautiful football at the end of the last campaign. Rodgers is getting through to these players and it's working.

I'm also not convinced that 3 of the top 4 spots are completely locked up. This is a sport, not a computer simulation. Moyes could shit the bed at United in his first year. Pellegrini's style of play may take time to gel with City's players. Gareth Bale could get injured. Arsene Wenger could get his jacket pocket open.

As far as I'm concerned it's anyone's game. Rodgers has only been in place for one year, and he's the SIXTH most tenured manager in the Premier League right now. Stop and think about that. I know it doesn't matter as much who your manager is when you have a crazy Russian or a group of arabs writing massive checks for your squad, but damnit we're building something real here and now's the perfect time to strike.

I'll be honest, I thought last year we were going to get completely run over by the top teams. On paper we did, but if you watched those games you saw the Reds kicking some ass when no one thought we would. We hung in there with manu. We changed our tactics and counterattacked vs. Arsenal. We should've beat City twice. And that was with a team that was still trying to learn to apply what Rodgers is teaching. Now we're stronger, more experienced, and we're getting that eye of the tiger back. We're ready to win.

Now's the time, lads. Now's the time we stand up and say fuck everything else in the entire world because all that matters is that Liverpool is the best club on the planet. Best supporters, best manager, best history, and brightest future. I'll scream my fucking lungs out even if we're down 6-0 to Scunthorpe United after being relegated to League Two.

Jese has the higher ceiling of the two but Morata is the more mature one at this point. Morata saw some la liga playing time last season with the first team, wasnt spectecular but was good taking into account that he was just there to play the trash minutes. Can play both the left wing and the striker role. The number 9 role suits him more because of his height and positioning. He got a lot of minutes this preseason and from watching all of the preseason games I can tell that he has really grown. His positioning is great but is still lacking the finishing. He reminds me of Raul, but still has to improve his finishing and aerial ability. His most successful campain was the u21 Euro this summer.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efXGCmG-XfE



Jese: I haven't seen Jese play a lot, but from what I've seen he is gonna be star if he keeps improving like this. He is fast, agile, but lacks strength. Has a great dribbling and likes to take on defenders, but mostly uses his speed to get by them. What i noticed is that he plays on the left wings mainly, but sometimes drifts to the middle. Again like bale and ronaldo is a goal-scoring wing player. IIRC scored 20 something goals and broke the RM Castilla's goal scoring record set by Emilio Butragenio.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr07QZYX9tI

I would hate to see any of these players go, and I dont know how can Perez justify his decision to buy(or try to buy) bale for 100 or so million. Our team looks scary this year with all the talent in the midfield and we have 3 players that can play on the right (Ozil, Isco, Di Maria) and like 4 players that can play the CAM (Ozil, Isco, kaka, Modric).

As far as references to the respiratory system of Time Lords go, the Fourth Doctor speaks on it in at the end of *The Robots of Death*:

&gt; LEELA: Doctor, why didn't the helium make your voice go squeaky?   
DOCTOR: Because I'm a Time Lord. I've been around, you know. Two hearts, respiratory bypass system. I haven't lived seven hundred and fifty years without learning something. After you. Little mouse. 

Although here he's implying that it's a combination of his physiology as well as a learned skill.

In *The Pyramids of Mars* the Fourth Doctor is strangled to the point of (seemingly) passing out, even to the point where Sarah is unable to detect his heart beat. He explains this with a very matter-of-fact:

&gt; DOCTOR: Respiratory bypass system. Useful in a tight squeeze. 

Similarly, The Doctor has pointed out multiple times that, as a Time Lord, he requires less oxygen than humans to survive, like while they were trapped on the Moon in *Smith and Jones* or when fixing the oxygen pumps in *The Ark in Space*. This would imply that the Gallifreyan respiratory system is significantly more effective than a human's

And what do you know, the change to designated days for flag flying at city hall and the restriction of orange parades were amongst the reasons listed. 

Comes across as a politically motivated temper tantrum really. This 'lack of consensus' wasn't there until other unionists decided to suddenly change their minds because being hardcore anti-shinner might just win them votes.

This can and probably will be spun as Unionism yet again holding us all back because they aren't getting their way. I strongly suspect they'll lose from this politically. Again. The only thing you can be sure of from unionists is that they will find a way to trip themselves up and snatch defeat from the jaws of 'victory'.

So Sandro scores this wonder goal at Stamford Bridge, then starts doing some chicken dance thing as celebration in front of Redknapp. And the manager is trying to get him to cool it because we're at the Bridge (where we rarely seem to get a break) and he needs to get his head back on quickly.

And I think there may have been... 2? ... episodes in series 5 that I didn't enjoy all that much. 

Overall, by the numbers, Moffat's tenure as show runner has been infinitely better than Davies'. Especially when you consider that the best episodes of the Davies era were written by Moffat. 

The man certainly has his faults. I mean, almost all of his female characters have the same personality (unless they're interacting with one another) and the love conquers all theme is occasionally overplayed.

But series seven largely suffered from the fact that casual fans had spent the last two series complaining about the storyline being inaccessible to casual fans. Moffat listened to their criticisms and tried to incorporate more one-shot episodes and he's been hated on constantly for it. 

And as for a female Doctor, I really have mixed feelings on that. I'd love to see a woman take the role, I really would.

We offered him a new contract when Spurs were flying, and he either turned it down or postponed because he was flirting with the FA for the England job. Shock, the job goes to Hodgson. Redknapp runs the team into the ground, and we completely blow it by coming fourth, Chelsea winning CL aside. Should never have lost third, frankly. He appears on the EURO 12 punditry team, talking about Levy and how he's planning for the summer etc. Basically opening his fat gob when specifically told not to. Then he goes to the papers and talks about how he needs a new contract- ""you don't let a player's contract run to the last year, shouldn't be different for a manager"" or some such angling bullshit. 

This is after he already turned a contract down (when it suited him). I think it was basically just a step too far for what had been an ""odd couple"" type relationship between him and Levy. In hindsight we absolutely made the right decision.

To those new fans who have only known AVB, you have no idea how different the team's playing style looks now sometimes. How AVB managed to switch around the team, his tactical knowledge, his lineup changes...Redknapp by the end had no tactics at all.

The thing that everyone (motorists, cyclists, the lot) seem to suffer from is the justification that they alone have the rights to the road. Motorists go with the 'road tax' gambit, cyclists with the 'always defer to the most vulnerable' argument. 

Now that cyclist argument would make sense - except just yesterday I watched someone swerve in-front of the bus I was on without indicating because they wanted to be on the cycle-path on the far side of the road. They were listening to headphones and it didn't even seem to register with them that they nearly got flattened. 

...and that's not an unusual occurrence here in Birmingham. When I was living down in Portsmouth I lost count of the number of bikes that ran red lights or swerved between traffic. 

Point being... *everyone* is to blame. Road tax might not be a 'thing' but that doesn't mean cyclists can throw their caution to the wind - any more than motorists can dangerously carve-up bikes because they're faster and larger.

Compared to that we now have Mignolet, Lucas, Suarez, Johnson, Enrique, Agger, Skrtel, Aspas and Sturridge in that age gap of 24-30. Of these Mignolet/Aspas are new, Skrtel future is in doubt, Suarez wants to leave and Enrique is about as quality as Riera was during 08-09 season. 

Its true we have a good crop of talented youngsters but barring Coutinho the rest - Allen, Henderson, Sterling, Ibe, Alberto and Borini arent ready to start every game. 

I had high hopes for for this window - hoped owners, BR and our scouts would bring the players with the right age for the first team.

We had the Cellar bar, which was fantastic for a night out, until the owners tried to diversify, losing the original client base.
The owner of the Cest La Vie block pulled it down to build apartments.
The council closed down Heaven &amp; Hell when they rebuilt the shopping centre.

&gt;The number of people in work increased by 69,000 in the three months to June, up to 29.78 million. That is the highest level since records began in 1971.

Either there are 29.78**0** million in work, or you should have rounded up the 69,000 to the nearest ten-thousand. If I told you a piece of string is 10.5 meters long, 564mm shorter than it was yesterday, you'd probably wonder why I'd even bother to mention it. 10.5**000**m though, is a different story. It's a matter of *precision*. There is no point in describing a degree of certainty in one number, and then comparing it directly against another number that does not have that same degree of certainty.

&gt;Youth unemployment, among those aged 16-24, increased by 15,000 to reach 973,000.

This is an example of *good* numerical representation.

Now, if only they could address the *travesty* of this manner that is the headline.

&gt;UK unemployment falls by 4,000 to 2.51 million

 What the *fuck* use is telling me about 4,000, when that might not even be enough to change the 2.51 million? Was it 2.514 before that? If we're rounding down to 3 significant figures, then we'd write that as 2.51 million *anyway*, so that can't be it. What if it was 2.51**5**? Well why wouldn't you then write ""down 4,000 to 2.51**1**""? In fact, **if we examine the uncertainty in that number, 2.51 could be anything from 2.506 to 2.514**, if we're rounding.

1) Clearing

IF you dont have the grades for your first choice, this is your first stop. Find out what universities offer the course you want to do through clearing and just ring them up (after accounting for the normal crap like where it is, what is actually there and all that jazz). You should find that if youre reasonably switched on they'll be biting your arm off to take you, so you should get this done quickly.

If you're still set on going to your first choice university instead of the one you end up at, you can complete the first year at your clearing university and attempt to get into the second year at your first choice university - you should be able to transfer your academic credit through something called the ECTS scheme which basically means that the amount of work you have done for each module is standardised across the EU.

2) Foundation year or degree program

If you dont have the grades for a full degree (even with clearing) you can try ringing the universities up and asking for their foundation year or foundation degree program. The foundation year is basically a crash course in the relevant a levels with some practical experience for your actual degree which will normally be at the same institution.

Foundation degrees are effectively two out of three years of an honours degree which you can top up later to a full one, worth about 240 ECTS credits.

3) Open University 

Try grabbing a place at the OU - fees should be (slightly) cheaper, although I dont know if you can get funding through the SLC for it. Allows you to study and work at the same time which is pretty handy let me tell you.

4) Enter as a mature student having gone and worked for the last X years.

Surprisingly popular where I am - I'm surrounded by a lot of guys whose employer is providing a degree as theyre being groomed for significant management or quality control positions, or just people wanting to get that qualification for that promotion or a career change.

Basically, dont worry about it. If you're passionate about your subject you should do fine - and when you get there you will quickly find that a significant portion of people could barely find their arse with both hands anyway.",0,1376561503,null,0,false,0,cbo6ptc,t3_1keqoi,t1_cbo6ptc,t3_1keqoi,null,1429822092,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"Whilst ideally I would love to see a 4-3-3 I think in match 1 there are a few things to consider.

- Crystal Palace will likely try and go for the draw (parked bus)

- A player who is match fit will be more valuable than someone above them in the pecking order who is not.

- AVB will likely not play Capoue as he will want to integrate him slowly

I think the most match fit players are: 

Defence: Walker &gt; Rose &gt; Dawson &gt; Fryers &gt; Kaboul. I would prefer to see Kaboul start over Fryers with Capoue off the bench if it isn't working out.

Attack: Lennon &gt; Defoe &gt; Chadli = Townsend &gt; Soldado &gt; Adebayor. I would like to see Soldado start with Defoe off of the bench.

Midfield: Siggurdson &gt; Dembele &gt; *Carroll* &gt; Paulinho &gt; Sandro &gt; Holtby

Bit of a catch in midfield. Sandro is probably not fit enough to play 90mins but needs to get some minutes to build up fitness. Because of this I would like to see a 4-2-3-1 to start switching to 4-3-3 with Sandro coming on at some point. Our fresh players get a good chance to make an impact and our 'best' players get to work on fitness/system.

4-2-3-1:

-----------------  Lloris 

Walker - Dawson (C) - Kaboul - Rose

----------- Dembele - Paulinho * 

----- Lennon - Siggurdson - Chadli

---------------- Soldado  

* Paulinho/Dembele is a very offensive double pivot that I think can do the job defensively against CP as well. 

Subs should be 3 of: 

- Kaboul -&gt; Capoue

- Soldado -&gt; Defoe

- Siggy/Paulinho/Dembele -&gt; Sandro

- Lennon/Chadli -&gt; Townsend

         Walker      Dawson (c)   Kaboom         Rose

Sticking to AVB's 4-3-3, I'm hoping he might pop siggy in the middle as a forward playmaker rather than having the ueber defensive (but ueber scary) middle three of Paul, Sandro and DavidDemblebe. I want to see Holtby play there eventually.

I think AVB is showing that he's preferring rose and, at any rate, to have pace in both fullbacks against Palace on opening day seems like a worthwhile move. Kaboom is hopefully fit enough to start, otherwise we'll see Zeki again for sure. 

On the bench, I hope we bring along Defoe, Holtby, Carroll and Townsend - I think all of them can change up the game if we need some extra first-time shooting, midfield spark or direct wing play respectively.

Capoue can fill the slot made vacant by the sale of Caulker in the event of injuries (which unfortunately will likely be the first game of the season), and it seems like AVB prefers players that can be flexible.    

Unfortunately I wasn't able to see any of our pre-season matches, so will have to defer to others on the LB situation, but I think that if we keep BAE and he is healthy, there's no reason he can't revert to the form from two seasons ago.

true,Rich_Og,lfc12,,"The Carroll deal was tied to the Torres deal, so we didn't really pay 35m for Carroll rather than get 15m extra for Torres (from 35-50) after we'd already accepted £35m for him presuming that we'd get Carroll for 20m.   The management had said they wanted Carroll plus 15m for Torres.

This is important because realistically the mistake wasn't overpaying for Andy Carroll at all (since technically it actually made difference only to Chelsea not us), our 2 biggest mistakes from that transfer were:

1. Not seriously clenching the balls of another PL Team who want our player. - Why were we willing to accept £35m in the first place when CFC would have went to £50m. That's the biggest problem and I think we've learned from this as shown with Suarez. Screw the mantra of ""if he says he doesn't want to play for us then he can get a quick move at a knock-down price"".  If we had wanted 50m from Chelsea for Torres at the start we might have lined up a suitable player in the 35m range initially.

2. Disclosing the Carroll fee in this case. The club when constructing a deal that went to £35m for a player that was obviously worth about half that should have protected the player from everyone's immediate expectations by keeping the fee undisclosed.

I agree, they will likely reduce the threshold over time. The Purpose of VED is to encourage lower emissions. Currently the Threshold is 100g/km of CO2, it's now fairly easy to find a car below this limit. even 4x4's such as the Nissan Quashqai are below this limit for certain models. Therefore the VED can be said to be fulfilling it's purpose. 

&gt;Electric cars will be paying the equivalent tax in our lifetime.

Agree again, but since this is relatively new tech, expect subsidies for a long time yet. 

&gt; I can buy a gas-guzzling V8 4x4 and drive it 20,000 miles per year around a country estate tending cattle without paying the tax.

See, this is interesting. This information is asserted in many places all over  the internet, even by chillingeffects, the EFF and so on, but no one seems to know where that assertion actually comes from.

Having discussed the matter with several solicitors over the years, the main issue is misuse of your registered trademark, not similarities to your trademark, except in egregious instances and - even then - it is remarkably hard for you to lose rights to your trademark, as long as it has been well established. Companies should be more concerned about dilution of their trademark through the use of a generic term ('to google,' 'aspirin,' or 'hoover' for example) and, even then, it is still difficult to lose your trademark. Consider that Hoover is still able to claim trademark rights even though it is now a generic term.

Yes, it is. That's why you don't need sneezing insurance.

&gt; A cyclist scraping down the side of my car could easily cause a few hundred pounds of damage.

Okay, so your actual argument isn't that scale is irrelevant, but that cyclists can cause enough damage to be worth insuring.

The reason cyclists don't legally need to be insured (and I agree) is that ultimately these kind of incidents aren't considered sufficiently common or of necessary scale to necessitate insurance. Especially with respect to the advantages of encouraging cycling. This is in contrast to the case for cars, where accidents are frequent and of large enough scale that compulsory insurance is a much clearer net positive.

I know your argument will be 'I disagree about the scale', and I'm not going to argue with you, but do you at least understand the distinction here, and how/why people disagree with you?

(Edit: For example, we need to ask how many cyclists actually scrape down cars and cause hundreds of pounds of damage. Then we need to weigh this against the money spent administering an insurance system, and the time spent working within it and policing it. For cars, the insurance system is well accepted to be the better option. For cyclists, it is not so obvious.)",0,1376570018,null,0,1376570238,0,cbo827v,t3_1keosf,t1_cbo827v,t1_cbo7quf,null,1429821464,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

What is so wrong with that? We are going after a player who may have a reduced price due to club politics/financial difficulties. He is also a player who has expressed interest in Liverpool in the past and who may be willing to overlook some of the negative aspects of our club at this point (from a high-end transfer prospects perspective).  If Anzhi only let it be widely known he was available recently, after several of our other higher value targets fell through, what is wrong with us going for him at that point? Isn't this how we should be going about getting top-level talent without the draw of European football?  

&gt; I think it is the same old problem that Rafa had with then owners - failing to notch up a few million here and there so that we can bring decent players. Remember how Rafa wanted to bring players like Dani Alves and Jovetic but dint have the cash?  *[Quote from you in a post further up the thread responding to /u/dr_draik]*

But you are upset that we may spend a decent amount on Willian? We may be paying slightly more than we should for him (although this window has had some very inflated fees so far) and that point is debatable.

Claiming that it's only worth having insurance for expensive damage is a slap in the face to people who struggle to make ends meet.

&gt;The reason cyclists don't legally need to be insured (and I agree) is that ultimately these kind of incidents aren't considered sufficiently common or of necessary scale to necessitate insurance.

As for *frequency*, there were about 20,000 cyclist casualties on the roads last year. Consider the thousands of other incidents that don't result in an injury, but do result in damage to the property to at least one party.

&gt;I know your argument will be 'I disagree about the scale', and I'm not going to argue with you, but do you at least understand the distinction here, and how/why people disagree with you?

I understand fully why cyclists might disagree.

All of this makes perfect sense.

true,WonderboyUK,null,null,"My concerns with this are the following:

**Demographics**

Nowadays when people send post it is either: bills/documents or cards. The majority of people that send letters as a form of regular communication are elderly, a demographic that are generally not going to encounter the site.

**Impersonal**

Those that choose to send a letter to another person will generally know them. The site is a printed and void of any of the personal touches that are found in handwritten letters. I would argue people receiving letters from relatives or friends would rather want that personal aspect to the letter. If you think of a letter someone close to you wrote, how would you view it if it was a print out containing the same words?

**Trust**

When sending a letter through your website the sender is trusting that the contents of the letter and the address were transferred from the website to you and printed correctly. That element of unknown can be a factor that people consider. When they post a letter they know they got the address right and Royal Mail have the letter, it may get lost but they know it's Royal Mail's fault. When you add two different bodies into the letter delivery it can be perceived as doubling the risk of loss; something could go wrong with you as well as the Royal Mail.

**Lack of personalisation**

The site doesn't have the ability to personalise the message. People who care about a typed letter may not want it in such a plain format and may just resort to doing it themselves in MS Word. If someone just wants to send a letter second class they may feel the price to too high and again just do it themselves.

**Misleading**

I'm being pedantic now but one thing I would also note is that your site claims the letter will be posted within 2 hours. Although you mention delivery times you're still implying that at 1am a persons letter would be posted by 3am. In reality they would not be posted until the morning. 

I have to admit I like the idea but I just can't see where the demand is going to come from. I haven't sent a letter in over a decade that hasn't been either a document or a card, which can't be sent through your site. Other methods of communication are just too prevalent to the vast majority. The only way I could see this work well is by opening up to businesses and mass mailing their letters. However this would require more features and personalisation options through the website. I don't mean to be overly critical or pedantic but you should definitely have some idea about how you are going to overcome these problems that may impact demand.

But I will because I'm an idiot. 

&gt;You people are all the same, hypocrites detached from reality with nothing useful to add to any debate about anything remotely serious.

I haven't objected to anyone's expression of their view. I haven't suggested you shouldn't say what you think. You suggested I shouldn't air my view because you think it goes against the majority view in the public forum. 

If you think I am detached from reality, feel free to elaborate. Better still, go look at the history of the British empire and research recent activities like the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and the recent wanton destruction of Libya. 

&gt;While there is a legitimate debate surrounding the specific of what the British armed forces have been used for, the training we give to soldiers, the reasons they follow orders and even the general concept of countries having military forces, literally none of your comments add anything useful or constructive at all the the debate. They are all hyperbole and grand statements from someone who's probably never even spoke to a soldier for any length of time.

I didn't want to make a thesis. Most of the comments in this thread are coming from a perspective of ignorance. I can throw a one line criticism or piss take if I like. Why would you be the arbiter of this, exactly? 

&gt;If you want to ""disrupt"" my ""pro-imperial-stormtrooper"" views, you're best off actually constructing logical arguments rather then talking out of your arse. Maybe then people will listen to you.


I could construct logical arguments until the cows come home. That won't affect your conditioning one little bit. The belief in logic and reason is ridiculous. Otherwise, you wouldn't be salivating over the armed forces. Otherwise you wouldn't be calling what you perceive my views to be as hypocrisy or talking out of my arse or whatever. The logical arguments have been made for years but people don't want to know. People are not educated and you sound the same. 

Whether I have spoken to a soldier is irrelevant. The individual views of soldiers are irrelevant to the function of the armed forces. Individuals might think they are protecting their fellow citizens. People in the Khmer Rouge probably thought they were protecting their country too. I know Israelis do. But they are deluded about the powers they serve. 

I don't care if anyone listens to me. People who aren't looking to learn will ignore me whether I call you a cunt or write an essay. Someone who understands something is up might be stimulated by something I say, or not. I am not trying to have a particular effect. I am just throwing my shit out there among the zombies. Maybe it's enough that one or two people see that they are not the only ones who suspect the common story is a hoax, at best. 

&gt;I mean, you haven't even asked me if I agreed with the war in Iraq or Afghanistan, but assume I was in favour of them both due to the fact I don't believe they are ""terror wars"".

Your initial response to me in this thread was not a signal to start an intelligent discussion. It seemed to me like another stock reply from someone who is unable to think for themselves. What you think of those wars isn't an issue for me. If you don't think they are wars of terror or something similar, why would I want to discuss that? 

Would you want to have a discussion with someone who rejected that America's assault of Vietnam was a war of terror? How much tolerance does one have to have towards pure fucking ignorance? The powers that employ the military are using brutal violence for personal gain. You don't think that's true? 

Go speak to someone who believes the world is flat and see how much fun you can have. 

&gt;Essentially, educate yourself, actually speak to the people that you're talking about in such a grand and extreme way and then come back with a constructive, logical argument based in reality and facts, not based on some bizarre set of ideals and gross exagerations.

That's very patronising. You can't spel even. Over a million dead, thanks in part to the work of the British armed forces in Iraq at the behest of the British government is not trivial. It's brutal acts of terror and violence committed by people who perhaps don't know any better.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; Below are the details of me being the victim of advanced fee fraud (terminology borrowed from the Action Fraud team), ...

I would be cautious about using this term ""advanced fee fraud"", as I understand it to mean something different.

Whenever I've heard this term used, it's always meant the ""nigerian prince"" scam, whereby the scammer claims to have millions of dollars that he wants to share with the target, but he needs funds to facilitate the process. 

The ""advanced fees"" are for paying the bank, bribing officials in this corrupt country, laundering the money &amp;c, and they start out ""reasonable"" and escalate - one the target is hooked, they feel obliged to spend more in order to recoup their investment.

If this were an ""advanced fee fraud"", as I understand the term, then it would be your fault and your liability. In the *nigerian prince* type of scam the target is told they're colluding with the ""prince"" (or oil executive or bent lawyer or whatever) to deprive the ""corrupt nigerian government"" of these funds.

If you allow the bank or the police to frame this as ""advanced fee fraud"", I think they might try to make it look like you're to blame (or at least partly).

I think it's important to recognise that either your phone was hacked (installed any dodgy apps recently?) or that the message was injected in transit, and is surely the responsibility of the mobile phone carriers.

I think it does make a difference as it makes those expensive cars more expensive, and provides incentives for the use of lower emission cars. Obviously the rich won't be affected and will buy them anyway, but it will price them out of reach for those who may have been able to afford them in the past.

We didn't *offer* £35m for Carroll; we told Chelsea what we'd want £15m + whatever we had to pay for Carroll. As Chelsea agreed to this, we didn't really care what Newcastle asked for him. If this lead to us not really bartering the price of Carroll, Newcastle took advantage of that to go as high as possible. What's at play in this is that we were effectively spending Chelsea's money, not our own, so who gives a shit what the price was. (This is actually a well known phenomenon: if you're not paying for something, you're not as careful about the price, quality and so on.)

The second part is that, after the total money being exchanged for Torres went up to £50, the deal (effectively Carroll -&gt; LFC; Torres -&gt; Chelsea; £15m Chelsea -&gt; LFC; £35 Chelsea -&gt; Newcastle) still went through.

I think people should take issue with the second part: that after Chelsea'd agreed to let £50m change hands, no one turned around and said ""Wait; do we *really* need Carroll now? Can we just take this £50m?""

Secondly look into joining your local LFC (official) supporters club as they usually have access to a number of tickets for each game.

Third certain packages like the ones you get from companies like Barry's Travel are usually quite expensive when you break down what you're getting  for your money, ferry, accommodation, match ticket. (I once ended up staying in Limbe - a good half an hour by taxi from Liverpool city center)

I'd recommend sourcing your tickets locally, flying from Knock/Shannon to Liverpool or Manchester Airport (half an hour from Liverpool by train and the station is in the airport) and staying in a cheap hotel - plenty around the city - also book all of these things as soon as you know what match you are going to so you can get the cheapest prices.

My three points will consider the culture of cycling, the potential for damage, risk of an incident, and the impact such legislation may have.

I think you need to consider cycling culture and the practicality of enforcing regulation on cyclists. Should you regulate cycling you would have to hold a student who rides fast and dangerously through a city center (I'm assuming this is the picture you have in your mind) to the same standard as a young child going down to the village shop or and old man pottering around town.

Regulation exists for cars because they are large, fast, dangerous, expensive and require a certain level of skill to operate safely. I'm sure we could do calculations on the average inertia of a car vs a bicycle in different environments, but I think we can be safe to assume that these numbers are vastly different and barely comparable. In the same way that we might consider how a roller blader or a skateboarder compares to a motorbike. The potential damage, therefore, is several magnitudes lower for a cyclist that it would be for a motorist. Let us not forget that if a cyclist is breaking the law or otherwise negligent in the cause of an accident they will still be liable for the damages. The grim reality is that in a collision between a cyclist and vehicles of increasing speed, the cyclist will be killed long before any significant damage is imparted on a motor vehicle.

As the risk of injury is so high to a cyclist, they are often ridden extremely defensively. Slow speeds combined with careful, defensive and observant riding, driven by a motive of self preservation leads to a very low accident rate for the average cyclist.

Encouraging people onto bikes has the benefits of reducing congestion on roads, reducing strain on public transport, improving health, reducing damage to roads and increasing the productiveness of the workforce. It is objectively extremely beneficial to actively encourage as many people as possible to take up cycling as a viable mode of transport. Legislation such as this would have a drastic affect on the number of people on bikes, most notably for one of the largest demographics - those who cycle instead of drive for financial or practical reasons.

Therefore, I would consider that insurance should be encouraged but not compulsory for cyclists on the basis that it adversely affects cycling culture, is order or magnitudes lower than motor vehicles in both cost and risk of injury or damage to third parties, and will actively discourage a transport method that is economically and environmentally extremely beneficial.",0,1376573481,null,0,false,0,cbo8vk2,t3_1keosf,t1_cbo8vk2,t1_cbo82ez,null,1429821084,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Other schemes such as cycleguard and other third party insurers offer 1m, 2m or 5m pounds of liability insurance.

true,PhantomGoatherder,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;I think you need to consider cycling culture and the practicality of enforcing regulation on cyclists. Should you regulate cycling you would have to hold a student who rides fast and dangerously through a city center (I'm assuming this is the picture you have in your mind) to the same standard as a young child going down to the village shop or and old man pottering around town.

No, insurance is different for different circumstances.

&gt;The potential damage, therefore, is several magnitudes lower for a cyclist that it would be for a motorist.

But there's still plenty of opportunity, in the thousands of accidents that there are per year, for cyclists to cause damage.

&gt;Let us not forget that if a cyclist is breaking the law or otherwise negligent in the cause of an accident they will still be liable for the damages. 

What happens when they can't afford to pay it? That's what insurance is for.

&gt;As the risk of injury is so high to a cyclist, they are often ridden extremely defensively. Slow speeds combined with careful, defensive and observant riding, driven by a motive of self preservation leads to a very low accident rate for the average cyclist.

Great, they'll pay hardly anything in insurance.

&gt;Encouraging people onto bikes has the benefits of reducing congestion on roads, reducing strain on public transport, improving health, reducing damage to roads and increasing the productiveness of the workforce. It is objectively extremely beneficial to actively encourage as many people as possible to take up cycling as a viable mode of transport. Legislation such as this would have a drastic affect on the number of people on bikes, most notably for one of the largest demographics - those who cycle instead of drive for financial or practical reasons.

The BBC estimate insurance per year of £30-£40. I'm not sure that's really going to put many people off.

&gt;increasing the productiveness of the workforce

Bikes are much, much slower than cars. How do they possibly increase productivity when you have to waste more of your time travelling on them?

On TVO it was on 7 pm Thursday with a repeat on Saturday, and most stories were split into 4 to 6 episodes at 30 minutes each, so really you had lots of time to digest the storyline. Usually it was preceded by an educational science short called Eureka!

On PBS, they had Whovies, that is they would take a 4 part serial and splice it together into one show or just show each episode after the other, almost always with a campaign segment between each taking about how you could get an umbrella or an oily sticker for pledging.

One big difference between today and then, is that if you wanted pop culture info on Doctor Who you had to hunt it down, *hard*. That was for pretty much any show. I remember a boy who had an anime magazine for Robotech way before the anime craze, memorizing the theme song in romaji. If you were lucky you could record the shows onto VHS tape, and I always used the crummy 6 hour play format to max them out. Sort of like having a 48 kbps mp3 instead of a 192 kbps mp3 today. Maybe once every 2 months I would be able to get a Target novelization, very often used. At an Ad Astra convention I literally spent hours at the books table gawking at how many they had. I was a member of ""DWIN"", the Doctor Who Information Network, where basically someone in Hamilton had access to an 11x17 photocopier at work and chugged out a bimonthly/quarterly newsletter. My parents got me the FASA board game, was that ever a treasure trove on info about Doctor Who.

If a used book store had DW novels, there were maybe 8 of them, usually 1st to 3rd Doctor stories with the stipled artwook. Comic shops had the over sized DW magazines from the UK, always shrinkwrapped. And 3 years old. Blue, as a colour, just *wasn't*. If you watch old Doctor Who episodes you'll notice that everything is a shade of brown. We had brew, bean, bellows, borange, bread, brack, bray and of course brown. It really was like that, *IRL.*

There was *no one* in my school who watched Doctor Who. Maybe one kid mentioned he watched it once out of curiosity, but it was for uber nerds. A couple of girls saw me reading a Doctor Who novel at the beach and tried to sic their dog on me. And that's probably the biggest difference.

true,landaaan,null,null,"&gt; No, insurance is different for different circumstances.

Still a PITA tho.

&gt; But there's still plenty of opportunity, in the thousands of accidents that there are per year, for cyclists to cause damage.

Yeah, at a much reduced risk and cost. For comparison I found a research paper from Belgium that suggested a 0.125 Euros per kilometer cost of bicycle accidents (mostly due to the cyclist being unable to work, rather than damage to anything) compared to an estimated £18bn cost of car accidents in the UK. Around 300,000 vehicles on uk roads travelling average distance of 6726 miles per year. Total distance covered ~ 2bn miles. Therefore cost is 8.92GBP per mile for vehicles compared to 0.11GBP for bicyles. Cost of bicyle accidents per mile is 8100% smaller. Furthermore bicycles travel much shorter distances.

&gt; What happens when they can't afford to pay it? That's what insurance is for.

That's what the legal system is for.

&gt; Great, they'll pay hardly anything in insurance.

And also means that they pay hardly anything in an accident ie they'll be able to pay for the accident without having any insurance.

&gt; The BBC estimate insurance per year of £30-£40. I'm not sure that's really going to put many people off.

That sounds about right, and yes it will still put people off. Enforcing bike helmets is enough to put people off and you can get a cheap one for £20-25. Read up on what research has been done into policy regarding wearing helmets, same argument can be applied to insurance. Universally considered a bad idea.

Same piece of paper. If you want a piece of paper, buy one from a US university online, it'll be a lot cheaper.

While one can argue that much of the quality of education depends on ones dedication, good lecturers/tutors/resources do make a massive difference...

Sadly though, many university faculties have been *gutted* by the changes to HE funding and those who can ""do"" have moved on, leaving those who ""can't"" to teach. And when I say teach, I mean ""provide the majority of their customers with the least challenging path towards obtaining a qualification, with no matter as to their ability or sutability within their chosen field"". 

With good conscience, no one who understands the shambles that is HE education should now be giving an unreserved nod to university education as the ""best"" route for young people to further their prospects anymore.

You have a car.

If the car is not on public roads, you send the DVLA a SORN. You don't need a tax disc, and that's the end of your dealings with the DVLA for the rest of eternity.

If the car is on the public roads, you are liable to have a tax disc, whether your car is a Bugatti Veyron or a Nissan Leaf. When you apply, the DVLA looks at your emissions to decide how much you should pay, and if you should pay at all.

So you have a Nissan Leaf. Yay! You're exempt from paying tax this year. You still have to apply for and display a disc of course. And every single year you own the car, you have to apply for one.

So what you're paying is an emissions tax. But it's only applicable in the first place if you're using public roads.

There is no such thing as car tax. There is only a tax to use a car with emissions beyond a certain level on a public road.

Well, if you thought that they'd committed a traffic offence, the correct course of action would be to report it. Even if you went to the police, whoever operated the courtesy car scheme would still need to be consulted to identify who was actually operating the vehicle.

Of course they're relevant. You have to compare the potential damage caused by cyclists and motorists. Generally speaking, the bulk of the risk posed by a cyclist is to the cyclist themselves, whereas you can very easily permanently maim or kill somebody in a car.

If a cyclist causes damage in an accident, they're not going to be going anywhere very quickly.

true,ravniel,num11,,"Honestly, I just get more and more unhappy about this saga the further into the window we get.  I would assume Levy has to realize how stupid it would be to sell Bale with this little time to reinvest the money, but he's done that before when players have sulked.  Bale hasn't done so *publicly*, but if anyone really doubts he wants to leave I wonder where they think he's been all these weeks.  He has convenient ""injuries"" - a different one every few days - just like Rooney (maybe a couple of them have been legit but what are we on now, three or four?  I don't buy it).  He has been conspicuously unwilling to deny that he wants to leave.  Even more conspicuously, AVB and the club haven't denied that he wants to leave - they're just stated they're unwilling to sell him.  Make no mistake, he wants out.

At this point that means one of two things.  Either he's sold before the end of the window, in which case we scramble to spend the money, and maybe get some good players in, but they're not ready until *weeks* into the season.  AVB is clearly unwilling to start players until they've trained extensively with the team, we've all seen that.  So anybody who joined in the dying days of August would potentially miss the entire first month of the league season.  *Or* Bale stays, but I don't see him accepting that and returning to training before the window closes.  So he, too, wouldn't be ready until at least the middle of September and would miss weeks of the season.

Either way this saga, by dragging on, has really injected some instability into the squad.  The bright spot is that we do have a good enough group to win, I think, from day one.  But the *real* squad - the one we're still working to assemble, one way or another - isn't going to be available even close to the start of the season, and we've been burned by that before.",0,1376578841,null,0,false,0,cboamd2,t3_1kezxs,t1_cboamd2,t1_cboa5e9,null,1429820270,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"when him and Borini were on at the same time it seemed like Borini played central with Aspas to the side.  I don't think there's any way that Sturridge is being pushed wide to accomodate Aspas either.  He's definitely the best attacker available to us aside from Sturridge and Coutinho though, so he should be getting the start.  I think this is going to be the first 11 for Stoke:

------------------Sturridge---------------

Coutinho--------Allen--------Aspas

-----------Gerrard-----Lucas----------

Enrique--Agger--Toure--Johnson

-----------------Mignolet----------------


I say this because the Lucas/Gerrard/Allen central 3 was really heavily played in preseason.  I think Hendo is the impact sub for Allen when we need to go more direct and dynamic play.  Allen was impressive this preseason though, definitely on better form than Henderson.  I think having Allen in the side frees Gerrard up to make some runs from deep and lurk around the edge of the area more when we're attacking as well.  All has a little more positional discipline than Henderson does and would be more mindful of covering the holes left by Gerrard getting forward.

For me it's really hard to pick whether I'd like to see Allen or Henderson start.  If Hendo starts I think he'll be on the left with Coutinho through the middle.  I REALLY want Coutinho going through the middle but I'm not sure if Henderson does well enough starting from the flank to make it worthwhile.   It's kindof a nice problem to have though, to have a few great options to pick from and not really be sure which one.

I don't really see how there'd be much public spending involved. Insurance is a private matter.

&gt;Well, if you thought that they'd committed a traffic offence, the correct course of action would be to report it. Even if you went to the police, whoever operated the courtesy car scheme would still need to be consulted to identify who was actually operating the vehicle.

You don't use the roads do you?

&gt;How do you intend to establish who is in the right without resorting to the courts or your insurance company (who would pursue the uninsured party in court anyway)?

The insurer is there to guarantee the money. I'm not talking about establishing who is in the right. You can be as guilty as fuck, but if you can't afford to pay, you can't afford to pay.

Just because you find someone guilty doesn't mean you're going to get the money off them.

&gt;Of course they're relevant. You have to compare the potential damage caused by cyclists and motorists. Generally speaking, the bulk of the risk posed by a cyclist is to the cyclist themselves, whereas you can very easily permanently maim or kill somebody in a car.

This would be reflected in the cost of insurance.

&gt;You didn't address the point about horses, invalid carriages, skateboards and roller-skates. A mobility scooter travelling at 8mph carrying a large person could cause a fair bit of damage. Should they require insurance?

Porto were relentless, powerful and determined, consistently launching wave after wave of direct, immediate attacks.

So, for example, if you search the [Community Trade Marks Register](http://oami.europa.eu/CTMOnline/RequestManager/en_SearchAdvanced_NoReg) for NATURAL in class 3, you’ll see that there are over 369 marks for similar goods that include the word NATURAL, which means that the word “NATURAL” isn’t particularly distinctive.  Therefore, the distinctive element of the marks would be, for example *BADGEQUO* NATURAL or whatever.   If a part of the mark isn’t distinctive then it means that no one company can hold exclusive rights in the mark, which would be a disaster if it’s the totality of your house mark!

Red Bull are acting as they must in order to protect their rights, as any intellectual property professional will tell you.  The sort of letter before action that Redwell received sounds absolutely standard.  It must be scary to get that kind of letter but it's pretty easy to get advice on [infringement proceedings](http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm/t-other/t-infringe.htm).  Unless your solicitor is an IP professional, I wouldn't necessarily trust them.  I've heard some solicitors spew all sorts of nonsense regarding trade marks with absolute conviction.  Bit like asking your builder his advice on the plumbing.

I'm pretty sure that Hoover kicked off a rather large advertising campaign sometime in the early 90s following a threat to their registrations.  As far as I know they went to some considerable effort to try to reinforce their brand rather than allow it to become completely generic.  I haven’t heard anyone under the age of 50 refer to vacuuming as hovering for a long time, but that’s just my personal experience.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well, its worth a visit because its free. However, the doctor will likely do nothing about it. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong but ADD doesn't really 'develop'. You either have it or you don't.

Treatment wise: Doctors in the UK are very hesitant to prescribe anything for it, especially if it isn't a severe case, like yours seems to be. It is usually reserved for kids with ADHD, where it impedes learning. The other options are counselling/therapy/social workers, but if you've got your life together, I'm not sure how much more they could do for you.

Do you drink a lot of caffeine? In people with ADD/ADHD it is supposed to alleviate symptoms, and has sort of the reverse effect to what it has on non ADD sufferers. There isn't a huge amount of research to back this up, as research was stopped because it is less effective than other stimulants for alleviating ADD symptoms. Often people with ADD end up subconsciously self-medicating with caffeine. 

________________

All that aside, your symptoms sound pretty similar to mine. Supposedly, I'm dyslexic albeit with a ton of coping mechanisms etc, such that I'm doing a masters in engineering and ability to do the material isn't the limiting factor, when compared to my laziness. I'm not really convinced that its dyslexia, but there are certain parallels. I don't want to sound like I'm boasting because I'm really not but my IQ measures over 140, so I don't neatly fit into any categories.

Often, depending on the material, I can read a paragraph or two of a book, then for about the next page, I'll *look* at all the words in order, but I'll be thinking about something completely different. This is pretty problematic. It means I can't really enjoy reading, unless it is really new-information-dense like with reddit. If something is really interesting, its not a problem so much, but if it is something that is meant to be fun to read for example, like a novel, I just can't - it takes too long to enjoy it. Harry potter 2 took me 24 hours to read total, in 4 sittings. I've been this way since I was pretty young. When told to choose books, I wouldn't choose stories, I'd choose factual books.

With TV, unless I'm watching with other people, I cannot just sit and watch tv. I will always be doing something. Same with games. I will rarely just be playing a computer game, I will usually have the tv on in the background.

Anyway.. I'm rambling.

The **discount** for VED is a **discount**, it's not an exception from tax. It is only temporary and will probably not exist in ten years for hybrids.

Once around 1/3 of all vehicles are free they will need to change it to maintain the tax income. 

Consider income tax; everyone gets around 4k as a personal tax-free allowance. You are not except from tax below that, you are simply within a threshold that gives you a discount. They still are subject to tax but in their case their bottom line is £0. Same with hybrids, they still ""pay"" road tax, it's just at this present moment they pay £0. They still have to do the paperwork each year.

If you're going to have insurance, you'd probably also want registration, so there'll be public expenditure on administration. Then there's the cost to the insurance companies, the cost to the courts and the cost to the police of having to stop cyclists and check their insurance.

You're advocating a system which would cost a great deal and accomplish nothing except give you some satisfaction that you get to see some little sticker on every bike.

The only people who'd benefit here are insurance companies. You want to force cyclists to pay a private company money because of some misguided idea about double standards?

(By the way, you can actually legally drive without insurance - you can opt to post a bond at the High Court instead.)

&gt;Skateboards and roller skates are not permitted on roads, other than for crossing.

They're prohibited from being used on pavements as they have no right of way, but there's actually no law - statutory or case - establishing whether or not they're permitted on roads (apart from by local byelaws).

&gt;Horse riders and mobility scooters absolutely should have insurance, and I don't believe they should be on the roads in the first place.

I suspect in hypothetical land if everyone started using hybrid cars tomorrow, or even jumped on bikes the government would introduce a new tax or at the very least would raise taxed elsewhere to make up the loss.

But my last point is also the main point. While I agree that it can seem like a tax to use the roads, its not a tax that pays for the roads (well, no more or less than anyother tax)....and that's sorta the problem cyclists have. Its not so much that some/most pay it, its the assumption that one leads to more entitlement because of it.

So as it stands the article is correct. But I fully accept you're also right in the assumption that the government might (maybe very soon) have reason to change the parameters.

true,Rohaq,eng-Cambridgeshire,Cambridgeshire,"I came out of school with two A Levels, a B and a D. I'd had a bad year; finding out I had a condition that may affect me for the rest of my life, my parents' divorce not long before, and things just generally being A Bit Shit.

Luckily, my mum never pushed university onto me; she said that she'd support me if I decided to go, but that I should only go if I wanted to.

Honestly, at that point, I didn't know what I wanted to do for sure; I knew I wanted to do IT, despite only getting a 'B' at A Level, but I didn't know what I wanted to do in IT. I was also pretty sick and tired of being in education, and wanted to get some actual experience under my belt.

I did a NVQ2 in IT Support, because there wasn't much work in my area of Wales, and they paid me £50 a week to do it (which barely covered the cost of the 16 mile 6am bus journey each day to do it). The course itself was depressingly easy, and it was fairly obvious that I knew more than the guy teaching it. At one point I took a screenshot of his desktop, hid the icons, and hid the taskbar, and he spent around 3-4 hours trying to figure it out, repeatedly trying to run some free virus removal tool that only covered 50 viruses, thinking that it would fix the problem. In the end he gave up and went to have a cup of tea; I felt a little guilty and switched it all back before he got back. I was a little bit mean back then, but boredom does that to you. As part of the course I had to do a month of work experience, and knew a few guys in a local IT store who were happy to put me up. It wasn't really anything I didn't already know, but it was fun working with other guys who enjoyed working with computers as much as I did.

Once that was done, I fled Wales to search for pastures new, and better jobs. I ended up doing temporary work, doing laptop warranty repairs in a place that I could only describe as a small step above slave labour; everything was numbers, numbers, numbers; it didn't matter than 90% of my repairs passed first time and out the door, they'd convinced themselves that people rushing repairs and getting a 20% pass rate was better somehow. In the end I was let go after 5 months - almost everybody was, because after 6 months they had to hire you on as permanent.

As I was job hunting, I drifted into bar work for about three months. Towards the end I was often asked to be bar supervisor, as I could apparently get things done. I did other daytime temp work on the side - the occasional network cabling run, working as a technician in a school, but I kept applying for full time work.

Eventually I ended up on an ISP support desk. The job started out okay enough; we had shift work, and occasionally had to do a standby shift for our big customers; getting paid £1 an hour to be available in case someone's leased line or colocated server went down, which was maybe one call a week if you were unlucky, and it was usually something on their end.

Then someone had the bright idea to open up standby support to our residential ADSL customers - Jesus.

The poor bastard on standby would get calls throughout the night, and then have to come in for their standard shift during the day. They were still only being paid £1 an hour for this. We put our foot down and said that the pay had to match the work, or it wasn't going to happen. Not keen to retrain an entire new team of support staff, we were given time and a half, but the fact that they were willing to try and get away with it was a real sign of how the company was run.

Combined with an asshole supervisor who would waste his days on myspace, and him playing favourites with his best buddy who got promoted to second line support (meaning he didn't have to do first line tickets, and spent his whole day on myspace). The whole department was badly managed too; we were supposed to pick up calls immediately, no matter what we were already working on in the tickets. This led to tickets being neglected, which caused people to phone in their problems. Combined with the fact that we could only log a single fault at a time with the broadband wholesale provider, you can imagine how well this all went.

I'd had enough, on two fronts; for one, I was sick of spending my days telling people how to configure their routers, and for two, I had to get out of this job.

I decided to find another job elsewhere, and decided to apply to university - it was 6 months till the next academic year, and I couldn't stand my current job any longer. I'd taken an interest in security over the years, and decided that there might be good money in it. I decided to apply to some universities for degrees in Computer Security. I knew that my grades might work against me, so I attended open days, and discussed my situation with staff there. They were amazingly understanding, could see that I was keen, and many just said to email them when I applied, and that they'd support my application. In the meantime I moved out of home to start work at another ISP doing first line support, for substantially more pay, better hours, and no standby shift. Even better; they actually knew how to run a helpdesk, with defined roles, meaning that everything got done, and task assignment wasn't just a panicked free-for-all. I was actually a little sad to leave.

I got to university, and everything was awesome, both in terms of education and otherwise. Suddenly I wasn't expected to learn everything by rote, there was less hand-holding in regards to work, and indeed by the final year we were pretty much left to our own devices. We were encouraged to research around topics without assistance (though the number of people who failed to grasp this was surprising), so long as we could offer references, and good reason as to why we were including them in our work. Suddenly I had some real control over my education; I could inject my own knowledge into my work, rather than being dismissed because it wasn't on the agenda; it made learning fun again.

I ended up with a First Class B.Sc. with Honours. I also won the best final year project award for my work with TrueCrypt volumes and forensic detection of hidden encrypted volumes using difference analysis, which then expanded into file system artefacts detected through said difference analysis.

Now that I've left university, I'm working in the IT department for an incredibly successful engineering company, where I've gained a reputation as a skilled problem solver; able to quickly come up with feasible plans once given a description of an issue, and someone who is honest if something simply can't, or shouldn't be done. I've just finished their two year graduate programme, where I got to play in many different realms of IT, and most recently have just finished a 6 month stint in their France office, and now I'm moving back to the UK to work with their information management team.

So despite my lacklustre A Levels, and despite not immediately going to university, I ended up with a degree, a great job at a highly reputable company, and I'm hoping, an even brighter future ahead of me. I personally wouldn't dismiss university entirely, it can be great if done properly, but you need to do it on your own terms.

Cycling should be encouraged in place of driving, cycle lanes should be built and people should be educated on the rules of the road and road safety. That would have a greater impact on the problem you're trying to solve.

Note that 80% of cyclists have driving licenses. In fact, cyclists are one percentage point more likely to own a car than non-cyclists. Members of large cycling organisations like British Cycling get third-party insurance of up to £10m included in the membership fee, which is about thirty quid. By the way, there's a million uninsured drivers who kill 160 people a year and injure 23,000. Compare that with deaths and injuries from cyclists.

How about placing the concern where it belongs, which is with the large motorized vehicles that actually cause the safety problems? Why not just come right out with it and just say you want to penalise cyclists?

&gt;Admin will get paid by the additional tax income.

Switzerland used to have compulsory bike registration and insurance. They abolished it in 2010 because *it wasn't cost-effective*.

&gt;Police don't stop and check anyone unless they're doing something wrong.

Like not having insurance.

&gt;This is what's called an appeal to tradition.

But here are my predictions assuming there are no significant new additions (which sadly is starting to look like it may be the case):

&gt;Where will we finish?

6th. Spurs will be in the top 4, but Arsenal will edge us for 5th, which is going to be annoying as shit. 

&gt;Who will be our most important player?

Coutinho. I think a lot of our goals are going to be traceable to him even though he won't score too many himself. 

The other answer to this question is Daniel Agger.

&gt;Who will be the most disappointing player?

Could be Johnson or Enrique, but I have a bad feeling it's going to end up being Aspas. Not sure why as he's looked good in preseason; I just do. 

Which positions do think we still need to strengthen?

&gt;CB, LB, wings

&gt;Which player needs to improve from last season?

Borini - not that he played a lot, but he needs to make a much bigger impact when he does.

Allen - needs to return to his pre-injury form.

Skrtel - if he could somehow get back to being good, that would be great.

* Aspas/ Borini, we all expect big things from Suarez (if he apologizes) and Sturridge. Aspas/ Borini will be the players that score the goals we need but hang under the radar. I'm expecting a total of 15-20 from the two of them.


* Sadly, I have a feeling it will be Alberto. He came in and did very well against lesser teams, but I have a feeling that when he comes up against stronger teams (physically stronger like stoke) his form will drop and he will have a hard time. Hoping I'm wrong though as he looks great and is definitely one for the future.


* We need depth at LB and CDM, should Skrtel leave we **NEED** a great young CB. A right wing would also be good since we sold off Downing.


* Skrtel definitely (should we keep him), or Lucas. As much as I love Lucas, we need him back on top form. Should we have that I don't think that 4th is out of the question at all.


* Man City, Chelsea, Man U, and Spurs. (*Why?* Because FUCK ARSENAL SUAREZ IS **NOT FOR SALE!!!**)

true,ibpants,1972crest,,"Top goalscorer is a little tougher this year.  Aguero shouldn't have to be anyone's support striker, but a glance at the squad and it looks for all the world like 2 little men to set them up and 2 big men to put them away.  In that scenario you figure Aguero's job will be to set them up, but he's the best all round striker on the team so I'm (perhaps contrary to logic) still expecting the most from him.

Guidetti could use a loan for me.  There's enough depth in the squad that even a bad run of injuries and fixture congestion should be manageable (there's enough creativity in midfield that a lone striker system is perfectly workable).  Maybe a half season loan (preferably within the Premier League), and reassess in January.

Very happy with Negredo, and while Jovetic is the more exciting signing, he's probably a tough less necessary in my mind - I'm still happy though, and I expect to see him feature to some degree on Monday,

I think Dzeko will blow hot and cold like he usually does.  Negredo strikes me as the more complete of the 2 big men, but the exciting thing is that they can play together as a sort of attacking double pivot (i.e. they can take turns to drop back and provide service while the other acts as a battering ram), which would make things a little less predictable, and if we're up against an especially well parked bus they can both camp in the box and be a dual battering ram.

As for legendary moments, the twin goals of Aguero and Dickov are the one's the spring to mind.  

Going further back have a look at Denis Law's backheel that relegated/did not relegate Manchester United (depending on who you ask.  A bit of context - despite being a City player before and after his United days, Denis Law is absolutely their hero, he played more games and scored more goals as a United player than anywhere else and any United fan that doesn't recall his name as a club great deserves your scorn.  Going in to the derby on final day of the season United needed to beat us and have other results go their way in order to stay in the top flight.  With 10 minutes to go, up pops Denis Law with a cheeky backheeled goal to put City ahead 1-0, Denis was incosolable, the rags were furious, we were laughing our arses off.  

As it happens, other results didn't go United's way, so they would have been relegated purely on the basis of them having been shit for the entire season, regardless of Law's goal.  You could equally say that regardless of other results, Law's goal ensured that United were relegated.  Either way it was a delicious moment.

The other one I'll mention actually comes from a Winger, but I missed the AM/Winger thread.  No big story around it beyond it being the League Cup final, but have a look at this beauty http://youtu.be/XLUalqgCZts?t=40s

Coutinho. I know we all love the guy, but we all already have WAY to high expectations for him, we're going to expect this guy to do the stuff Iniesta is doing but in reality, he's not there yet.

true,ravniel,num11,,"Bale has had at the very least a gluteal injury in addition to the foot injury you name, and I'm pretty sure there was one more. It certainly hasn't been the same for a month even on paper. It's possible the injuries are genuine but they match a pattern for wantaway players. If all you're willing to hear are direct quotes from Bale saying he wants to leave it's always going to be easy to convince yourself he doesn't; he's not Suarez, we won't get that kind of evidence.

AVB isn't in charge of transfers and it's a simple fact that Levy has sold players right before the deadline before and left us unable to spend the money. I'm sure Ramos and Redknapp were equally unhappy about that but it happened nevertheless. How many consecutive windows are people going to say ""Levy wouldn't be stupid enough to do _____,"" watch him do it, and then tell me I'm a fool for thinking he might do it again? We're doing very different business this summer and I'm quite pleased about that, but there's time for old failures to recur and AVB won't have the final say. What's naive is thinking that the club is a purely rational actor who will surely do whatever you and I think is wise.

And it's also a simple fact that the squad is going to be disrupted by these goings-on. I don't mean psychologically, which is what I think you're reading. I mean literally that the squad is still in flux and will not be in place before the start of the season. The XI we'll field for those early games is still quite strong, so it's not a crisis, but it's still unfortunate. Whether Bale is sold or not we don't have our real lineup training together, and won't until ins and outs are finished. Late business burned us last season and I don't like to see it again. That's my only real point. I actually imagine the mood in the dressing room is pretty good, so I'm not saying it's a morale issue.

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","Cars are allowed on the road without insurance - why shouldn't cyclists have the same right?

A car driver needs to deposit £500,000 with the Accountant General, to prove that they can afford to pay out if they're found liable in court for the sorts of damage a car can cause. If they can't do that, they need insurance that can cover it.

A cyclist isn't required to deposit such a sum, because the damage they can cause is at the sort of levels where a court can take it out of benefits or wages as a monthly payment, and have it repaid in reasonable time.

And in both cases, to get payment you generally need to take legal action - insurers do not pay out on a whim, but only when they know that if they were to insist on being taken to court, they'd end up paying out more than if they pay out now.",0,1376586363,null,0,false,0,cbodkja,t3_1keosf,t1_cbodkja,t1_cbo73us,null,1429818862,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,GreenBeret4Breakfast,null,null,"I agree, in part, to what you are saying but I think its pretty hard to quantify an entire life-path through its financial implications. Higher education, at least at university level, is so much more than getting a couple of lines on your CV. Its about getting out of your home town, living by yourself and meeting new people. All the while studying a subject which you (hopefully) enjoy. 

The course you take will likely have just as big an impact on your employability as the university you choose to do it at. I would never advise someone to take a degree in art to help them get a job as an artist, but if you can spend 3-4 years of your life carefree and doing something you enjoy, then why not?

Sure you come out owing the government thousands of pounds but its not really debt in the usual sense. Its not debt thats going to stop you from getting a house or a car, its not going to come after to you and repossess your TV. Its just going to sit there until a time comes where you are, hopefully because of your new found education, getting paid a decent salary.

Agger needs to be a leader and show he can organise and defend set plays better as thats definitely one of our biggest weaknesses.

Johnson or enrique probably, both had up and down seasons imo.  Controversial but maybe sturridge doesnt get the goals we're expecting   but i have faith in him.

A Section 8 notice is far worse than a Section 21 in so much as it is an ""at fault"" which may count against you in the future if you try to rent and it comes to light. With a Section 8 notice you could not apply for council housing when you're evicted as you made yourself intentionally homeless. There is also no requirement to serve it on a set date like a Section 21 which can only be served at the start of a rental period or with 2 months notice. A Section 8 notice is also enforceable for up to 12 months after it was issued so even if the person leaves and the LL says you can stay he can change his mind and evict you under the existing Section 8.

Also as they're taking rent and most likely not informed HMRC the LL could report them and then HMRC could come after them. If they are also claiming income based benefits and not declaring the income they're committing benefit fraud too.  

If you're paying £300 a month each as well, the LL could technically sue for breach of contract for £300 per month.

Where did the cult of the Master come from in The End of Time? How did the barrier with the alternate universe become passable again? How did the heart of the TARDIS turn the slitheen woman into an egg and grant Rose godlike powers? 

The Sixth Doctor once discovered that the time lords had moved Earth across space, killing most of the population in the process. How was Ten able to drag the Earth light years across space with an old Type 40 TARDIS without stripping away its atmosphere, freezing everyone to death, or causing massive seismic activity?

For a humourous look at RTD's writing, I quite enjoyed the ""abridged version"" of The End of Time [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_wgTcMiC4) and [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_DLayU1RjA).

true,kopking08,null,null,"I think you picked an interesting example, in that Tevez and Suarez are, in terms of tenacity, similar players. This is why I think a lot of commentators (notably Carragher) and fans think Suarez will still play hard when he plays.

In my mind, the reason the situations are different is because Tevez whole game is the fact that he is tough as nails and keeps going when others would stop. To take the fight out of his game would be for him to disappear on a pitch.

Suarez, while similarly feisty, gets more of his goals based on his combination of skill and tenacity. In my mind, with his head potentially elsewhere, we could see his finishing ability depleted. We could see his will to win depleted. We could see any number of things.

Basic point is: we don't know what to expect. Will he loaf around the pitch until he gets his way or will he fight as long as he's in the shirt? The fact that he's gone to the lengths he has to force a move - lengths much greater than most other players in recent memory - you've got to expect he's pretty stuck in on getting that move.

I doubt very much he cares for how much he is sold. He only cares about moving up. What will be funny is if Arsenal fail to qualify for Champions League and end up in Europa without him. Successfully ruling them out of a potential move in January. 

Personally I don't believe in the loyalty part of football. Players will always get the rough end of the stick. If you're playing well the team will be loyal to you. If you aren't you're shunted out. 

How many teams nurse players through rough patches of form these days? The only reason we nursed Hendo, Downing, and a myriad of others is we had no other choice. 

I think we'll have Suarez this year. I expect just having him will benefit our club. I expect we'll get roughly the same amount of money we want for him now next summer from some club swinging a big dick. He won't be sold in the league and he won't be sold cheap.

But the reason we'd sell him a bit cheaper outside the league is because these unhappy player situations become a circus. And when the player is far and away your best player it is impossible to escape. It becomes a cloud over the club. The only reason Utd and City have gotten through players demanding transfers is because their squads are unbelievable. They do hold all the chips. We are trying to, but we'll see how that works out for us.

My personal hope is to get into Europa but be close enough to 4th to make clear we're in for a shout at 4th next season. And to do all that without huge help from Suarez. Instead have Sturridge, Coutinho, Gerrard, Aspas, and whoever else we bring in, lead us. That way we can sell Suarez without worrying too much about how it affects our prospects in recruiting top talent. Which, right now, matters. Players only come to teams outside the CL if they think the team is on the ascent. As long as Suarez is here, we can reasonably claim we are.

The reality is Arsenal have not gotten better and they're just holding onto past positions of strength. Unless they sign a top striker there is no reason to think they'll get the same points total this season. 

Tottenham are known bottlers. They always do. I can't even understand it at this point. But with the Bale situation potentially hanging over the club for the season, it may be hard for them to find a rhythm, improvements or not.

Often times we fans place to much emphasis on signings. We see other clubs bringing in players and assume its going to change the game. Tottenham proved last year that their signings were all but worthless. The players they've brought in this year could be great or they could be average. All will be looking to adapt to a new league, new opposition, and new style of play.

5th maybe 4th if spurs lose Bale and Arsenal have a poor season.

Suarez if he stays, Coutinho if he doesn't.

Borini. I like the lad but I don't think he'll have as much of an impact.

Left back to provide competition with Enrique, CDM for Lucas backup and a goalscoring winger to replace/improve on Downing leaving.

Enrique needs to be more consistent throughout the season but probably Borini overall as he wasn't up to standard when he was fit.

true,Jaguarkmd,lfc68,,"My thoughts are that you have a misunderstanding of math.

At most, 3 players can play central midfield positions, and even that is a bit of a stretch as one of them will be playing CDM. But in either case, before the January window Liverpool had Gerrard, Allen, Henderson, Sahin, Shelvey and Suso. After the January window Liverpool had Gerrard, Allen (before his injury), Henderson, Shelvey, Suso, Coutinho and Lucas.

By my math that is either 6 or 7 players for 3 positions, only two of which are creative attacking positions.

Now personally, along with most people (I think), I think Suso is best suited to playing as a 10. But here's the thing, Suso is not, and has never been the most talented player in our squad. Playing him as a 10 would have meant taking out a central midfielder and losing control of the midfield. 

So you have a choice (and this, based on Rodgers quotes over the last 15 months is what I think his thought process has been), get 'the most' out of a 19 year old kid with some, but not unbelievable talent, but throwing away the midfield battle. 

Or

Play Suso left and Sterling right, stretch the back four and pin it back with Sterlings pace. Giving more room for Luis Suarez to roam around primarily central areas and kick the ball in the goal. Suso's technical ability makes him good in possession so he provides us with mobility. At the same time as a lefty playing on the left makes space for Glen Johnson come inside and attack. (I appreciate Suso/Sterling also played right and left respectively but similar principles apply, it really depended on which side GJ had to play). 

Regarding Coutinho, he's shown that he can play left and create and he can play as a 10 and create (and muck in with the midfield). It really remains to be seen where he'll play regularly but I suppose it's down to who else we have available, what the opposition are like and so on. Either way he's going to be a danger. 

&gt;I'm not sure we made the right move by loaning him out

I do like Suso, but let's face it, the club loaned out a 20 year old lad whose best attribute is technical ability to a Spanish team.

* Coutinho will become the new Suarez with his hand in everything good we do.  Hopefully he'll be happy here for the coming future.

* Disappointing?  Sorry guys, but Kolo Toure.  I think this is only due to the ridiculous amount of overrating on this sub of his skills.  He is a smart player and seems like a great dressing room influence, but his pace is gone and he is not as comfortable with the ball at his feet as Carra.  He'll perform decently, but he won't be the CB stalwart that people seem to think he'll be.

* I'd like to strengthen at ST/RW, personally, and I think another fullback is a great idea.  I see a top CB as imperative in January or next summer, though.

In my mind this may get the best out of him, but I am still worried about our ability to cope against physical PL squads with an attacking quartet that has not been well trained in applying defensive pressure (anyway you slice it, by putting a pure 10 in the CAM position we become defensively vulnerable on the counter attack and in general if we don't dominate the game).

As far as Suso goes he's clearly best suited to the DLP. But, as we all know, Gerrard has that spot on lockdown. After him Allen probably takes the spot, even though his game is different.

I sadly think Suso may never make it into our first 11 without a serious shift in our midfield situation. I'm not sure how long we'll be able to hold onto him to have that come about naturally.

No one would deny Suso is a very soft player, basically incapable of offering defensive protection. So to start him at CM in the DLP role would mean we'd need a monster DM, which Lucas is not (despite his qualities). We'd also need the CAM to be more of a box to box type who could dismantle attacks. Hendo plays that way but if Coutinho has the role we can't reasonably expect him to start there.

The only way I see Suso making the Liverpool first team regularly enough to not be sold is by becoming a better winger (certainly possible) or by our squad changing more than I anticipate is possible. We'd need full backs who were more defensive. We'd need a different DM and a different CAM. 

Unless Suso does something amazing this year, I don't see us making those changes to accommodate one player. More likely is he plays well enough this year to be sold next year for a decent fee. Not because he isn't quality, but because he just doesn't fit right now.",0,1376593483,null,0,false,0,cbogk6r,t3_1kfmk5,t1_cbogk6r,t3_1kfmk5,null,1429817395,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

This is why the Caulker sale is pretty infuriating on the surface. If he pushed for it hard and really wanted to leave I understand, but we can't really risk spunking 15m on a Phil Jones type player so it was nice to have a capable Englishman that we got for basically free.

true,ohyoubeauty,null,null,"Appreciate the debate (and all the replies in this thread, kind words or criticism) and I don't mean to be rude, but Liverpool matches where Suarez has played on the flank for an ""extended"" period of time, according to my notes:

2012-13 – Second half of 1-3 at Southampton (left) [zero LFC goals scored and one goal conceded in 2nd half]; 2-2 at Arsenal (left) [until 71st minute]; 1-1 at Sunderland (left) [until 65th minute]

2011-12 – 6-1 v Brighton FA Cup (right); 0-1 at Fulham (left) [until 72nd minute red card]; 0-4 at Tottenham (left) [until 27th minute red card]

Feel free to argue with my classifying of formations; it's especially debatable in the 2011-12 matches. And all three of those 2011-12 matches included Carroll, which makes its relevance to the current team more than questionable. But the fact remains we've seen little to no example that Suarez out wide works at Liverpool. Yes, when he drifts there from a starting central position, but not when he starts there and/or spends most of his time there. Only the Arsenal match last season and Brighton the season before could be classified as ""successes,"" with Suarez scoring in both. Liverpool only earned the draw at Sunderland last season after Borini went off and Suarez moved into a central position. Where he scored from.

Yes, he played there often for Ajax. That doesn't mean it'll translate to Liverpool or the Premiership. He doesn't play there for Uruguay anymore, and hasn't for quite some time.

That's their *current* role, but Robinson's comments go back years - back to when the UUP were the largest party, and were largely responsible for driving the Maze plans forward. He says the UUP fully signed up to the current plans, endorsed the listing of the objectionable buildings, and committed the Peace Centre to its particular location. As a result, he suggests that their current objection isn't down to any sincerely-held beliefs, but rather artificial political machinations to spread some FUD around the DUP's opposition to Sinn Fein and pick up some votes from people that's important to.

I have no objection to parties being *rude* to each other, but if the claims they're simply doing an about-face to try and score political points are true, this surely isn't the behaviour of a productive opposition party?

As for banks deliberately teaching their staff that breaches don't happen... are you fucking stupid? Why would they do that. Banks teach staff that breaches DO happen. Do you think the police tell police officers that there's no crime? Fuck off.

Security breaches do happen. But two things don't.

Like all accompanying international football already know, Suleyman Kerimov will cut its huge investments in Anzhi Makhachkala . This will result in the output of the main players on the team, including the Brazilian midfielder Willian.
I spoke on Thursday with former Corinthians player and Shakhtar Donetsk, who no longer go to the game this weekend against Zenit. Said it had no official proposals after the crisis of the Russian club, but confirmed one made by Manchester City a few weeks ago, as I mentioned in the post linked above. Said, however, that aims to act in the Premier League and praised the Liverpool club must make an offer.

Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham. No matter the club, where William - bought for 35 million euros for Anzhi six months ago - he certainly have a positive impact on the team too large. Full interview below.

The first question is obvious and necessary: ​​what was your reaction when you saw news about cutting investments Suleyman Kerimov in Anzhi and then when I had confirmation of this news?
I was caught by surprise. I just saw the news on the internet, then when I arrived at the club heard comments from many people, but of course it was a surprise. Nobody expected it, I certainly respect the decision of each. He must have his reasons for having done so. Try to stay calm, follow the work and do not lower your head, even with this situation.

There was no indication that this could happen?
No, definitely not. The project was very big club, brought quality players, of course the club is still new, has several examples of new clubs starting to bring players and take time to adapt. It takes a while for the team to gain rapport, and when I arrived at Shakhtar, as at Manchester City, as in Chelsea. I do not know if it will happen again, as we learn by it will use more Russian players, do not want to invest much.

Among the objections raised by the Russian press for decision Kerimov, the weather was bad blood between players Anzhi, citing including the fight between Igor Denisov and Samuel Eto'o. It was bad weather?
There was super quiet. Very good mood, do not know if there was also this same fight between Eto'o and Denisov. I have not seen, I have not seen, so I can not speak. But the mood was quiet a quiet group, the players always played, there was never any problem and since I've always been treated well. I have nothing to complain about the climate within the group.

How was the conversation with you? Who told you that you are free to ""seek"" a new club?
Nobody actually ... Had no personal conversation with somebody, chairman, president ... He only warned that Anzhi will not invest more that six months from now the team back to Makhachkala, back to live there, they will get more Russian players and foreign players, if they have an offer, it will help.

The very Kerimov said that to the players?
There. He warned us. Not wanting to give anyone for free, but made ​​it clear that getting good an offer, an offer that at least comes close to the values ​​that he bought the players for sure it would help, will help players go. Not giving anyone free, not as out in the press, on the internet 'settlement Anzhi'. Surely get an offer good for them, will release, if not get will not release. That's it.

A few weeks ago Manchester City made ​​a bid of 40 million euros to Anzhi for you, that this offer was refused. This happened before the crisis burst, before Suleyman Kerimov choose to cut investment in the club. What are your expectations now? Think by the end of this transfer window, ie until the end of August you will be player probably an English club?
've seen several sites, news of some clubs interested and my expectation is certainly great. I do not know the club, but is expected to play in a big club. As they promised they will help me out for which place I want to go, then I'm cool. I know if I get something I will get good news.

The ""Guardian, the British newspaper much credibility, said in recent days that Liverpool prepares an offer of 35 million euros for you. Till now, after everything that happened, there has been no official proposal?
For now it's just the same , conversations. Officer had no guess. As you said, was Manchester City who just refused and it's been a while. Now I'm hoping, of course, in the coming days to receive an offer from a club like Liverpool. If even Liverpool, it sure is a great club.'m hopeful and peaceful hoping for the best.

I will insist in the Premier League. Tottenham can ""lose"" Bale for 100 million euros and there would be a club that would enter the fray for you too. There Arsenal, Chelsea, I will not ask you the preference for such a club, but England is your goal?
Absolutely. Of course England is a league that many dream of playing and I'm not diferete. I love the Premier League, much like the style of English football, and certainly if it happens will be good for me, for my image. 'll Grow professionally, are a Cup year and surely this will be a showcase for me. Not that I'm going there to be summoned, but sure I will have more chances, more appear. It is a goal, but the Spanish league is a league interesting, I really like the Italian is also a league that I like. The important thing is I'm happy.

You cited the selection. Missing one year and are not so many commitments of staff there, but you really think playing for a club such big leagues his chances of joining the group increases? Even because Oscar is the holder on the frame, but still do not have a reservation ...
The chance may increase depending on what I'm producing. It does not help I go to a big club if the income is not the same as introduced in recent years in Ukraine and even here. I have to keep producing good football and growing every day, playing better. If I'm at my best, my chances will increase.

Of course now, looking back, it is easy to comment, give an opinion. But it hits a certain regret the decision to have gone out of Shakhtar and gone to Anzhi, bankrolled the only club that termination fine, as the Ukrainians did not want to release it?
None. No regrets, I'm calm. If I came here was because I wanted to, nobody forced me, no one forced me to do so. I have no regrets about coming here. Everyone knows the history of the offers that had Shakhtar do not even need to say. Everyone knows of offers declined, so I wanted to get out of there and only club, as you said, we proposed to pay 35 million euros was the Anzhi.

Do you play video games?
Lately I have not played ... Long time no game.

But've played enough?
've already played.

When you select a team in the Premier League what?
While playing with a team was not English, playing with Barcelona or Real Madrid.

So would be good choices too, is not it? 
(laughs) Gee! Who does not want to play for Barcelona or Real Madrid? Great choices, but let's see what will happen in the coming days.

His expectation is that the outcome of their situation happen in the coming days at the most in a week, or think will linger until the end of the transfer window on August 31?
do not know. It may happen tomorrow or one day 31. I hope that everything can be fine. Do not want to leave here fought, I have great respect for the president and everyone here. The offer is good for me and the club, either tomorrow or dseja 31st, hope everything is quiet.

The Anzhi Zenit grabs this weekend for the fifth round of the Russian Championship. You're not going to the game?
Yeah, not going to the game.

The main stars will not play?
Some players will not play. The Boussoufa and Diarra did not play. The Eto'o I do not know, I do not play and do not know if I have a few more players, but of course others that had always playing will not work in this game.

It was a decision of the technical committee, board or yours?
's decision not to play this match was next to my direction. We talked and we think better, I personally, my situation was this, we better not play that game. Anticipating some situation further ahead, some offer, but that's what we agreed. Not playing against Zenit.

That is, until now no official offer to English clubs after the crisis, but consultations have happened to your business? Someone from Manchester City, Chelsea already talked to his manager to know about the value that should be offered to Anzhi?
know that there have been some conversations, but do not know about the values, not my manager told me. He just said he had conversations with some clubs.

Which clubs?
Nor said.

true,TheFost,cnty-ni,Northern Ireland,"Vehicle excise duty is a pigovian tax, it is not designed to tax people for pollution created by vehicles as this article implies. It is designed to tax people for the negative externalities created by using vehicles, one of which is pollution, another is the space they are taking up on public highways. 

Standing still a car takes up more space, but in moving traffic a cyclist actually takes up much more space on the roads. A car can't pass a cyclist in a single lane and cyclists are usually not capable of keeping up with traffic, this means space on the highways being utilized inefficiently. When cars are stopped at traffic lights a cyclist can however pass a car in a single lane of traffic, this then uses even more space when the car has to repass the cyclist which exacerbates the problem. 

This greater negative externality may be offset by the lower (but not zero) emissions of a cyclist, but is it completely cancelled out? This is the key question and it depends subjectively on how highly you value reducing pollution, should cyclists using the roads inefficiently be subsidised by everyone in order to encourage them to keep cycling and create less pollution? In my opinion no, making cyclists pay a reasonable vehicle excise duty would not deter a significant amount from cycling and would split the cost of the infrastructure more fairly.",0,1376598136,null,0,false,0,cboigzn,t3_1keosf,t1_cboigzn,t1_cbo5puh,null,1429816504,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

I mean, when you see your companion being all distressed and confused, the last thing you'd say to them ""Oh, I'll be a completely different man, I'll be dead completely, some other dude will take over and walk away""... No. You say that you're the same person, you just look different so they won't be scared, so they'll still trust you, so they won't be sad. 

And if there is one thing the Doctor does, it's try and keep his companions safe. 

If he truly didn't care about regeneration, then he would do it far more often. Just think of how many times it could have saved their butts if he had just regenerated? How much simpler it would have been? 

He has always been reluctant to regenerate, try and avoid it as much as possible.

true,Halk,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"&gt;The attacks you hear are the ones that are detected, generally ones that result in financial loss. For all of those there are probably many more that don't result in any financial loss and no one knows any better. There are plenty of private detectives that can do this very, very reliably.

Common sense says that criminals who can access your bank account and not get caught will take the money and not get caught. 

&gt;There is an almost disturbing industry-wide lack of audit controls on access to account details.

This simply isn't true. Periodically I'll order audits, and I can be very specific about what I'm looking for. Most of the time I'm trying to find out what happens when a customer requests x or y, and trying to determine what happens during the course of the enquiry. However I've had audits on everything a member of staff has done in a week, or month. Or likewise exactly what has been done on a particular key - be it a customer, product, etc.

&gt;Continued cost cutting means that staff are paid less and less, trained less well, and are willing to accept small payments to do things they shouldn't.

Industry salary averages (and not just at the top level) have beat national trends. But yeah, there's people who will be coerced by various means to obtain data. If they try to do it in bulk they get caught. If they do it outwith the normal pattern then get caught.

&gt;You think banks are always honest about fraud and security problems?

Err. Nope? We're not outright dishonest, but for various reasons we don't blow our trumpet about breaches etc - however we do train and retrain staff and change and rechange procedures constantly to react to adaptive criminals.

2. Think about what you actually want to do at uni. Why biochem? Do you have a specific career in mind because you might have a different path you can take. So you really need to think about this.

3. It's still early days for clearing so there are still plenty of good universities which will have space on their courses. If you are not picky you don't have to just do biochem - could do biological chemistry, biological sciences, medical sciences, immunology etc. The fun thing about this field is that there are a lot of options.

4. If you really want to you should be able to repeat your year at your current college so you don't need to worry about exam boards etc 

5. If you're feeling stressed out make sure you don't keep it to yourself. Talk to your mates or family. It's what they're there for!
