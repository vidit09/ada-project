EC-135s make about 25% of all the world's emergency medical flights.

The Super Pumas are a 1970s vintage enlarged version of a 1960s vintage Aerospatiale military transport helicopter that's about 2-4 times the weight and can carry up to 19 passengers or 4 tons of cargo.

It's like comparing an ambulance with a single-decker bus.

A year or two ago there might only be a couple posts a day but they stimulated conversation about the team and events supporting the team with the occasional picture of a shirt or match tickets.  However, now these are the only posts that seem to pop up and I can't say I never posted one or two of them.  I was stoked when I got a couple kits and came here to show them off when the sub was still around 1000 subscribers.  I'm sure it bugged some people but it slid through because the sub wasn't being drowned in similar posts.  Now I seem to see shirt/ticket posts at least once a day and am getting tired of it because it's just an overload.  As far as instagram/twitter posts go, I don't use either, so as long as it's related to the players/club I like seeing them - though I understand why people who do use those sources may not like them here as it could get very repetitive.




As far as mods go I just think you guys need to be more visible.  Maybe you've been posting the same as before and it just seems like less activity because so many people are posting now, but it used to be the mods were an integral part of the community, often joining in the conversations and just seemed like normal users.  I didn't pay much attention to this latest controversy so I won't comment on anything regarding that beyond the fact that reading back on it all is really embarrassing as a CFC fan and someone who loves this sub.



As far as getting anything off my chest... can we calm the fuck down please?

true,B4mf0rth,null,null,"&gt; Worker-self-management (autogestion), for example, has been shown empirically to be more efficient and equally or more productive than traditionally managed firms, not by politically-motivated researchers but by capitalist transnationals themselves - most famously Ford.

Is that true for all industries, of all times and all businesses? The manufacturing factory conveyor belt, or a production line is a very limited case study, particularly against modern business. 

&gt; People only need direct input into decisions in proportion to the degree to which those decisions impact on them, their families and their communities.

So how much of a decision? Given that a person could build a company from the ground up on their own back, make it successful on their own, feel they could relax their work load a bit and hire a few employees to make it easier for them, then something out of his control happens, company is no longer profitable , why is he obliged to give anyone genuine voting power? If he is a decent man, he would take the community's voice in to his consideration anyway? why would you deny him full ownership of what is his? That is what I fundamentally disagree with. I would expect a decent man to listen to me if his decision affected me, but I would not expect to have partial ownership of something that isn't mine. I've contributed as a worker yes, but I was rewarded for that. If I want decision power, that is part of the incentive to work harder, come up with new ideas, develop the company and climb the ladder.

I also just disagree with the information structure argument based on my experiences in work - anecdotal evidence counts for nothing to anyone else but the person it happened to so I won't detail it.

&gt; No parties.

How can you stop people affiliating with each other on political grounds? Forming pressure groups, forming internal unions? Their voice even if it ""is heard"" will get lost amongst the thousands of others being heard, people will form parties because that is a more secure way of getting what they want. You could ban them, but they are still going to form, and the ban will be a major point of social dissatisfaction. 

&gt; With sufficient transparency, do you believe that they would?

I think they would, and we can disagree on that, but so long as you admit there is a possibility no matter how small, what is your contingency plan for that? Do you crack down on the disobedient public because they don't know what is best for them?
 
&gt;  I put my faith in anti-capitalist freed markets for now, unless and until practical experimentation suggests this faith is misplaced.

I respect that, I place my faith elsewhere.

&gt; I disagree that democracy, involving more people leads to more corruption, quite the contrary, if you believe human nature is basically greedy and corruption prone, why would you want to concentrate power and create hierarchies the corrupt and greedy can climb in order to leverage the State and its security apparatus and weaponry to exploit the rest of humanity?

China which has the largest bureaucracy in the world demonstrates this problem, the more the state has to do and the more people involved means there are far more opportunities for things to get lost in the system. And this was the case long before deng xiaopings reforms, the reforms have only increased the amount of money being stolen. I believe you can concentrate power to an extent, because it concentrates scrutiny, which makes it easier to catch them when they do wrong. It won't prevent corruption, and neither will economic democracy - human nature isn't wholly greed, but greed is a part of human nature. In China, there are so many hands in the system that is nearly impossible to catch anyone, and then even harder to prove. Relatively concentrated power balances legitimacy, effectiveness and scrutiny well, therefore it is the best system we have.

Listen, I know that everyone is upset that many peoples' favorite player and Chelsea's two time player of the year has gotten barely any playing time, but these posts are getting a little out of hand. I come to this subreddit to read about Chelsea and to have discussions about our tactics and our playing style and to enjoy the game threads and everything else. But I haven't gone on this subreddit recently because I don't want to see another argumentative post that has more comments than a game thread with people are arguing and downvoting each other. It's obnoxious and sort of childish.


You think I'm not upset Mata isn't getting his minutes? I am, but I don't know everything that goes on, I'm not the manager. And my opinion counts, so does everyone else's, but these posts need to stop. It breaks my heart to see Lamps not be able to be consistently like his old self, because I know we'll never get that Lampard back. And while I would hate to see him go, when he does, it's not like Chelsea are going to crumble. We're more than one player, and everyone must realize that.

Now I'd always try and do this with non union members as well but in a disciplinary context people are likely to open up more with their rep than with the people who are potentially sanctioning them.

true,FuzzedLogic,EN,england,"Pictures and Instagram pictures are usually 100% pointless. Can we either please make a weekly picture thread or ban them? It's entirely pointless and adds nothing. Just my opinion.

Post quality has in my opinion reduced significantly due to this. It's awful, usually at least 2/3 pointless picture posts per day.  I know some people like seeing them, and others hate them so I'd rather see it limited to a thread. People who like them can post in that and enjoy it. That's fine, and it won't take up a whole fucking sub page. It's a good compromise.

Also bored of lazy people who aka ticket questions. Very rarely do they ask questions already not answered in the sticky post. That's not mods faults though.

Match threads are fine, but as I've said before people are too reactionary when a loss occurs. Ends up being annoying. In modern football and we can't, and won't win every game. We will play bad in some games, every club does and has this season. We're not different in that aspect and the sooner people realise this the easier it'll be to read post match loses after games. The one against Basel was honestly embarrassing for me. I couldn't show that to a friend for example and say 'look what people think' because it was awful. Very few posts had reason or a logical explanation (enough shit about my name I've heard it 1000 times, it's derived from the sims and my old hair. Fuck off) to them.

People know my opinion on the Mata/Jose issue. I'm not going around in circles again. Hope this helps a bit.

1) I only recently heard of Reddit earlier this year, apparently, I had been out of touch. I guess this place utopia before?

2) As a Mod, I don't think you guys are doing anything wrong. The only real issue has been the recent events. With that, continue what you guys have been doing.

3) I believe another mod brought this up, Lach?, a few months ago. I'm pretty good at just largely ignoring the instagram/kit post, but I can see why it would be seen as annoying. With said, if one were to moderate this, who gets to decide what should be kept and what should be deleted? This is a tough one to find balance. Perhaps a little restrain from posters would be a start.

4) It is very hard to have a different opinion in this subreddit without being called a troll or just degrading into a who has a bigger dick shit fest. 

I've certainly made some critical post, even about Mata questioning his position with Chelsea over the summer. This was taken as absurd. Now that it has become reality, any suggestion of him needing to play is shot down immediately by some posters. 

What I am trying to say is that, different opinions degrades into the poster having to defend himself, rather than this views. Maybe I am asking too much, after all, this is the internet.

Perhaps I view things differently. I do not have any allegiance to a manager or player(s). I only care about one thing, and that is Chelsea.

These days most landlords wont let you even have a pet without extra deposit.

If you do it anyway, if and when your landlord finds out, it will be deemed that you've broken terms of your tenancy and he can issue you with a notice to quit. This means that your contract is void and you must leave the property within the terms set out in the NTQ.

If you do not leave the property within this time, the landlord can apply to the court for an eviction notice, which if you further failed to comply court bailiffs would evict you. You'd be liable for the court and legal costs. The landlord can also raise a civil claim against you for earnings obtained illegally through your subletting activity as this was not authorised.

You claim to be a cyclists yet do you honestly think a person on a bike is quick enough or aware enough of noise (in a city where its nothing but noise) that they would have any chance of getting out of the way of a vehicle about to hit them....What are they going todo jump over it?

At best they would get a 2-3 second advantage - which would be wasted as they turn and see their inevitable fate.

And a rear view mirrror is next to useless if another car rear ends you.

&gt;In the 3 most recent cases cyclists ignored the stopping lights at junctions and sailed out in to the path of rather large vehicles, getting killed. It was irrefutably their fault as the lights were perfectly obvious, and every car behind them managed to stop (cyclists given the extra space to start first at lights shouldn't abuse this, but are).

In the period of 5 years (2001-2005) in London only 2 cyclists where killed jumping lights. Now you're saying that the last 3 all died jumping lights (in the space of 2 weeks)?

I call bullshit.

&gt;and have yet, thankfully, to have been injured doing so.

If there is a cultural discrepancy, it is more to do with ignorance of club culture than geographic location.  There was a post two days ago about the different ways to support Chelsea, or something to that effect. I wasn't really sure what the OP was getting at, but the truth remains that part of supporting a club means having your finger on the pulse. Supporting a football club is a group endeavor, not an individual one. Knowing what people around the club are feeling/experiencing, etc is important. Geographically distanced fans, like it or not, are at a disadvantage. This does not mean we are not real supporters, but it does mean we have to listen more often than we shout from the rooftops. 

I was very confused by the ""Juan Mata Suicide Watch/Jose hasn't got a clue"" threads popping up after our loss.  They were kneejerk and naive, and brought out a lot of comments that seemed to put one player before the club (while also putting down Lampard, Jose, etc unnecessarily). Then there was MD's post, which was the most obvious sarcasm I could imagine, was taken as gospel despite the fact that it was nowhere near a serious analysis.  It was used as a springboard for a good amount of people to continue their overreaction to one loss. 

This sub has grown large, and what it will benefit from is less posts about tactics and players falling in and out of favor (since barely any of us are qualified to speak to it, even though like half of r/soccer we think we are because we read some Jonathan Wilson), and more posts about club culture and club history.  

I'll bet that a majority of people offended by r/cfcuk have no clue that it isn't a geographic distinction from r/chelseafc. It's a fanzine that's sold around Stamford Bridge before matches. 

So for me, what's detrimental to this sub isn't Instagram or kit photos, etc (though they don't added anything either), but rather posts that claim to be tactical revelations, or player form and favor, or anything that makes us more closed than open minded about Chelsea.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Alright , let's be charitable, you're not into banning anyone from marrying. But let's look at what you've said.

&gt; And the UK can do fuck all about it because the European courts argue you have a right to bring anyone over you're married to, even if you've never had a previous relationship with them. It's insane.

That's what you said. Now the only thing that implies is that you want it stopped - otherwise it wouldn't be ""insane"". The tone of the sentence implies frustration, anger at this happening.

You follow it up with this: 

&gt;What's insane is that a government has to automatically give the right of residency to anyone married, regardless of the reason. I don't particularly see why the British government should have to cater to the archaic system of family alliances from another culture.


So now you've clarified that your problem with the European Charter for Human Rights is that it lets people marry who you want, thus the British gov has to allow for people to live together as a family. You want it stopped- that would be the ""I don't ..see"" part of what you wrote. 

Let's remember your response is to *British* people marrying who they want. Not immigrants bringing their families. 

The only logical solution to your objection is curtailing the human rights available to Brits. 

So the question is, where do you stop? Do you force people into exile for marrying someone? Which is actually happening to some families thanks to the half witted application UKIP logic to current immigration regulations. So you would like people to make a choice, to live in the country they love or leave it?

Exile is a de facto ban. Marriage with conditionality is de facto control and legislation of the right to marry.

So the Doctor has to follow the Master, who somehow got a TARDIS or other interstellar transportation, to Gallifrey back during the Time War. The Doctor then has some chasing and stuff to do but eventually finds The Master with the box thing that destroys ( I forget what it's called). The Doctor realizes that it's too late and has to rush back to his TARDIS, but does keep some sentimental thing of Gallifrey. We then see the TARDIS flying away as Gallifrey is blown to smithereens, thus not creating a problem with fixed points in time. ( I know it's not stated that Gallifrey falling is a fixed point, but maybe it can be incorporated) The Doctor is angry and distraught at first because he tried so hard to save it, but then comes to terms with it knowing he doesn't have to bear the weight of the guilt that he had with the 9th Doctor.

TfL have explicitly decided that traffic flow (ie. making life easy for car owners) is more important than safety or quality of life. In the Netherlands, short car journeys are deliberately slowed down and made meandering to encourage people to walk, cycle, take the tube, whatever - with the additional effect that the streets are safe enough for children on bicycles or with a football. TfL and other local planners, meanwhile, would prefer to build a traffic-clogged dual carriageway that squeezes up to houses on either side than, say, pedestrianise Oxford Street to improve everybody's experience.

Also, he's usually on a yellow by then so he makes less tackles, or he gives away a load of free kicks. When this happens, it highlights how bad we are at winning the ball back or playing our way out of pressure.

Gerrard does need subbing sometimes, but Joe Allen is hardly an improvement defensively and other than that we don't have many options (especially since Hendo does a good job defensively on the right). This is why not signing another defensive midfielder in the summer was an oversight. We lack competition/replacement for Lucas.

Also, it has been very disappointing how we tend to give up possession in the second half of games. We play far more long balls in the second half of games and rarely press the oppositions half.

Bubble trips are still common place between Cardiff and Swansea where the away team is shepherded onto a bus which takes them to the game and at the end are put back on a bus and taken back to their own city to prevent repeats of the awful violence and vandalism that marred the south wales derby in the 20th century.

I don't agree that English fans are automatically ""better"" fans there are Americans on here who know more about the club than I.

Given that an independent Scotland and the remaining UK would be very close allies, isn't it reasonable to assume that we'd use each others' ports and infrastructure? In much the same way that US, French, etc ships and aircraft are welcome at many UK bases, I'd think it would be mutually beneficial to both nations to co-operate like that on defence facilities. The only thing they refuse to allow is nuclear arms.

I imagine Scotland has a better negotiating position here than we think.

That being said, he's acting like a merc.  Or a player tailor made for City, who is bigger than the team.  

Even when his natural idol and comparison [Drogba tried to console him after he took a penalty in an exhibition](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2407837/Romelu-Lukaku-given-supporting-words-Super-Cup-penalty-woe-Didier-Drogba.html), that based on his walkup, I could have guessed from an island in Greece (see: Ivica Olic, CL Final), he still wants to jibber jabber.

He's young.  Media will take advantage of a person regardless of age who runs their mouth and turn them into back page material.  Don't forget that Chelsea weren't even on Hazard's peripheral radar until we won the CL (another guy who took to twitter plenty to voice his desire to play in Europe and various other 'concerns').  Now he's a Starting XI cornerstone.  

People the age of Lukaku and Hazard with not even an ounce of their skill take to social media rather than their friends or family to bitch about things that range from European playing time to not getting two sugars in their latte.  It's the nature of the generation now.  He's a well paid guy who needs to come a bit back to center and he'll probably be even more effective.

tl;dr - Lukaku needs to shut his mouth, pound 20 goals in, and then the media will start to 'make' Mourinho talk.

The way the BBC is funded would never work in the US as there would be a surefire mutiny over the ""tax"" that would be imposed and how it would be unconstitutional.

My other secret was my local cable-access channels, QATV, that broadcast from the city library. It put real (and sometimes utterly crazy) people on my TV, including the memorable ""Tasty Licks"" cooking show from a stoners wood panelled basement.

true,BitcoinJobe,,IBWT.co.uk - UK Exchange,"We (IBWT) have different limits. Other exchanges are limited because they still exist chained to the banking world, hence the standard banking verification needed on most exchanges.

If you're selling and wish to withdraw fiat then you need to verify a withdrawal address, please check the [""7 Easy Verification Steps of IBWT""](https://ibwt.co.uk/files/Withdrawal%20Verification.pdf), via our [Resources](https://ibwt.co.uk/en/company/resources) page.

The limits are viewable via our [Verification](https://ibwt.co.uk/en/company/verification) page. And they are as follows;

Deposits (up to £10,000 a day): Only a registered account (over £2,500 you need to contact royal mail about special delivery). We suggest you try a little at first and test out the platform and see how it all works first.

Withdrawals (with a verified address): Up to £10,000 a day, unless you get fully verified then its up to £50,000 a day. We do plan on increasing this and creating higher tier customer levels in future development.

The reason we can do this is because money sent is done Nationally, as opposed to Internationally (where a bunch of restrictions and limits come into play). And IBWT expansion will be based Nationally in each country. Even national bank transfers have limits (£1,000+ raises flags, £10,000+ more so, etc, don't quote me on the limits, you would have to double check).

Also, the fact of the current regulations around Bitcoin in the UK (e.g. the Gov are generally leaving it alone at the moment). But please keep in mind that I personally think that they will eventually create regulations in the UK for exchanges and cryptocurrencies, and IBWT will have to unfortunately conform, so limits will be altered at this point (though not so much for fully verified accounts).

Do keep in mind that IBWT has a 1-3 day deposit/withdrawal time delay, because of the speed of Royal Mail (though we're looking into faster methods, mobile/email, etc). However compared to how long it currently takes to transfer money internationally to other exchanges ...",0,1385830137,null,0,1385830349,0,cdqa0z9,t3_1rn47r,t1_cdqa0z9,t1_cdq9krp,null,1428452255,1,false,BitcoinUK,t5_2wq3q,1

For their FTTC/FTTP services, there's no such thing. On day one BT is available, but so is everyone else who uses the BT Wholesale network.

It can take longer for the likes of Sky or TalkTalk to appear, because they choose to connect into the fibre network at every exchange rather than at a central point (e.g. via BT Wholesale) - and those physical connections take time to commission. They do it this way because their equipment is already at the exchange for the ADSL service, it's a lot cheaper to use the stuff they have in place than pay BT's extortionate rates to use the Wholesale network.

I had no problem at all getting service from a not-BT ISP - and I was the second line/installation on the cabinet, which had only just been brought into service that day. BT might be first with a marketing blitz (even though availability data is available to everyone else too) but that doesn't mean you must sign up with them.

It's not just UK forces that want rapid access to this area. Due to the fact that this is where Russian vessels and aircraft operate on their way to and from the Atlantic, the US also takes a very close interest in the G-I-UK gap. This is before we even consider the North Pole resource boom that's going to take off as the Arctic Ocean thaws and oil/mineral extraction becomes feasible... along with competing national claims to these resources.

I wouldn't mind if the stories touched on how horrid life was for some groups and that would be quite easy to work into the plots, but to have the plots revolve around the issues and for the characters to have either modern values or softened caricatures of historic values ruins the story and is insulting.

I like the mix of storylines, some set on the ripples of an actual event, others simply arising from purely fictional interactions. There is a finance element to the one you've not watched, which could have been very good, but the opportunity was wasted with the main plot line and then a lazy swipe at how bankers were hideous people in the past too.

Bad Wolf is the name chosen by the entity created when Rose was possessed by the time vortex, and is therefore a convenient way to name this entity.

So it is conceivable that the Bad Wolf corporation was set up due to the manipulations of Bad Wolf the entity.

The claim by Bad Wolf that it can manipulate space and time is later backed up by the destruction of the daleks that it confronted - as presented, not by any kind of weaponry, but by causing them to cease to exist. It also explains the Bad Wolf motifs seen throughout Series 1, as well as subsequent appearances of the Bad Wolf motif in the 10th Doctor's tenure.

If we thought we were better than the whole sub, would we, in CFCUK, discuss the best way to write informative posts as to get the new users up to speed, or consistently on every ticket post, even though they are annoying, help users try and find the most easy and cost effective means (even if that sometimes just mentioned looking at the sidebar)

Your posting 'last night' (and in no way have you ever been argumentative or incendiary before to users that frequent the other sub, and written it off as standing up for what you believe in) mentioned that you believed we were in some way flawed human beings because of the way we acted. In reality, we did something we though was funny and actively tried to rectify the situation after we realised people had taken it too much to heart.  

However, posters such as yourself, made it difficult for some to do that.

true,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,"Well there two thing that will effect your economy that way.

One is the macroeconomic factors well out of the hands of any government bar maybe the US, even then they don't have much more control. Labour's ""strong economy"" up to 2008 had be largely due to macroeconomic factors, so was the poor economy after the crash and so is the ""recovery"" now.

Governments in general have very little control over these macroeconomic factors so that is one argument to say it doesn't make any difference.

However how governments *react* to these sorts of issues still has an effect and can change how long it takes to recover from a crash. For instance if the UK decided to use greater quantitative easing and print shit tons more cash to aid recovery, it would devalue the pound, and in turn anything linked to the pound. 

This may be good for the UK, but not necessarily good for whoever it is effecting. While the UK government has made the Bank of England independent, it's important to remember they can hire and fire the chief, and they can always make it *not* independent again.

There are loads of areas like this where a separate Scotland would actually be giving away more control then it has as part of the UK (like say negotiating EU law changes for example).

If the SNP were making their arguments and including these facts and saying ""It's still worth it because of X,Y and Z"" then I'd feel a lot more comfortable with it. I know the ""Better Together"" side are just as bad, but they aren't attempting to change the status quo in such a radical way. People know what things are like now, they just look around. I feel  it's important people really know what would change.

The defence plan in the white paper is the thing that stopped me reading it.  I had already flicked through it and most of the 600 pages is complete  fluff and feathering, as is to be expected in these things - no problem there.  Reading specific issues in the index I came to defence:  I read it TWICE because I thought I must have mistaken what it was saying the first time.  It's cloud cuckoo land.  I read about the currency and the energy policy first, both of which make great assumptions on the UK's part without asking them, I searched for financing,  but I stopped after looking up defence.

They want ~£10bn of UK assets (£8bn in the article based on 2007).  There's around £50bn in Faslane alone, that's the cost of relocating it.  They then go on to argue that they're going to cut defence spending as a share of the UK and then  *increase* the number of serving infantry, take 2 frigates, a squadron, and supply craft...and then use whatever UK infrastructure they wish, with no mention of costing relocation of colleges, HQs, installations which aren't in Scotland.  And then the UK is going to pay to access Scottish airfields, and support Scottish jobs, to defend *their* airspace?!?  And this is all in the interest of the UK, supposedly.  They may get the UK to man some of their airfields to extend RAF coverage, but the rest is ridiculous.  If they want to price up UK assets, they can't at the same time not count their own UK assets, and just because they don't want a nuclear submarine base doesn't mean they don't have a nuclear submarine base.

It's absolutely a flight of fancy, a great deal of SNP policy, and very little objective analysis and appraisal of independence.  SNP policy and the cost of independence are two different things.

I genuinely, genuinely feel bad for the Scottish Yes campaign, or more accurately the Scottish people behind it that think they may want independence.  However one feels about independence, whatever side of the fence you come down on, they deserved so much better than this.  How many years have people been waiting for this report?  The defence plan in the White Paper is a joke.   UK army chiefs have already said that they can't base procurrment as a joint operation, not with different foreign policies.

Olsson also did well, his off the line header was a superb piece of last ditch defending.

Elmander looked a little casual about things. But that seems to be his style. Not sure he's what we really need up front at the minute.

Redmond again looked exciting on the ball but somebody really needs to do some work with him on the training pitch to address his shooting and crossing. I know he's young and that it'll come with time, but his technique is poor.

Some great moments from Hooper, something to be really enthusiastic about. He was composed for the goal, but generally his link up play was excellent. He was strong and decisive with the ball and seems to be starting to settle in properly.

The other notable performance came from Bassong. Worked hard at the back all game and put his body on the line with a few challenges.

Totally agree about Star Trek 2009, I also refused to watch Into Darkness for the same reason. Though I was sorry to miss out on Benedict Cumberbatch doing Khan, I will probably catch that on TV sometime. Star Wars has never really been sci-fi in any sense. Did you watch Prometheus? I haven't seen it yet, what did you think?

The old series wasn't always great. It had its fair share of filler and dodgy scripting too. Especially the last few years were it appeared to have lost its way slightly. But that's not surprising given the hostile environment it existed in. Still, it never did the hero worship thing that characterises the modern Who.

I thought that John Hurt mocking the way that Ten and Eleven behave might be a sign that Moffat is going to change the tone slightly in future. The choice of an older actor is interesting too. On the other hand, I worry that a large part of the audience tunes in for the pretty boys and the melodrama rather than the sci-fi. Maybe some of them will be turned off which could lead to a decline in ratings. Still, the show has always changed, that's part of what kept it going for so long.

A cash injection certainly was needed through all those years and it was too much of a one man team however selling potentially the worlds best midfielder for the next 5 years for 32 million wouldn't have fixed it. Gerrard has won so much essentially on his own even past 2005, not quite as many trophies as we'd like but had we sold him the team would be in way worse shape. Fair point VDV went for 4 million but that doesn't mean that we would have gotten him instead. Who knows we may have had an earlier Andy Carroll style overpriced player situation on our hands and now been sans Gerrard and in an even worse position. It's possible the sale of Gerrard would have helped the team overall but only if he went for bale/cr money because otherwise he has been more valuable than the most likely players we would have bought with that medium amount of money.

Poor. 

Stop making posts about players birthdays, their kids, or when you get a kit in from Sports Direct. Nobody gives a shit

There needs to be a moratorium on making threads after matches to talk about ""what I think went wrong/right etc..."". This is not your blog, you are not an ex-footballer on Sky Sports, and you are not that important. If you have tactical feedback, or you want to make a point about something that occurred during a match you should post it in the relevant thread. There have been too many shit self posts recently. That and most of the threads that exist post-match outside of the post-match thread are terrible anyways.

People who give input on squad composition, tactics, and the general operation of the club/team fail to substantiate claims or at the very least elaborate. I'm not a football expert so I normally keep my mouth shut, but if you're going to claim that your idea is better to the current manager's you better provide more than a sentence explaining why. This ""Play Mata because he is our POTY 2 times in a row"" stuff is trite and not conducive to quality discussion.


This might be just me but I'm sick of seeing videos from Munich and photos of ""DAE miss [Player/Manager xyz]"". We all saw the CL final, and most of us remember players like Ballack and Robben. Want to make a valuable or interesting contribution? How about finding a full video of the 1971 ECWC Final against Real Madrid, or posting a thread like [DAE MISS THIS GUY IN OUR BACK FOUR?](http://i.imgur.com/gKX5Bb6.jpg). 

&gt; Are we at a point where these instragram posts and ""look at my new shirt"" are unnecessary?

They are. As mentioned above, nobody gives a shit. 

I will say there might be some exceptions. I think OctaChaz posted his shirt collection a few months ago, that was pretty cool. Or if you come across something rare, like you managed to get the whole squad to sign a shirt. 

But it's grating seeing this all the time. We get it, you bought a kit online and it got delivered.

We should have a squad social media megathread. Post all players relevant twitter/instagram/facebook/soundcloud/whatever pages there.

&gt; Anything you want to get off your chest?

A very large contingent of people need to calm down when we lose or win by a small margin. I've said it before and I'll say it again, when we lose people act like it's 83' and the team is heading for the Third Division. The Premier League is probably more competitive now than it ever has been, I'm talking Any Given Sunday, so when people are in outrage that we tied to West Brom consider the fact that newly promoted Cardiff took 5 points from both Manchester teams this season. The league is competitive, and just like any sports team there are no guarantees. Pull your heads out of your asses.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"And what about all the spending that goes on housing, training, and paying Scottish troops which aren't based in Scotland?  It's all very well saying they currently invest £3.3bn but only £2bn is spent in Scotland, but they're still going to have to account for some of that Scottish money that is spent in the UK when they bring troops, facilities and capability to Scotland.

If you look at what percentage of spending for the Royal Engineers, for example, is spent in Scotland it's minimal.  It's based in Kent.  The Royal Engineers in Scotland are represented by 71st Engineer Regiment which is a Territorial unit headquartered at RAF Leuchars, 3 TA centres across the whole of Scotland, and a field troop in the Orkneys.  You can't have infantry brigades without engineer support, and whilst there'll be more than their fair share of Scottish born engineers based in England, that money that isn't spent in Scotland is now going to have to be spent in Scotland, with barracking and training and head quarters.  And Alex Salmond just scrapped it.  So to simply say that Scotland can cut to the level currently spent in Scotland and make increases is deeply flawed.

Now do it not just for Royal Engineers but for every other specialist; veterinary, REME, nursing, logistics, signals,...if they're headquartered in the rUK you going to have to get building.  Then, understand that a large chunk of that MoD money goes on civil service based in England.  Whilst hugely wasteful an independent Scotland is now going to have to fund procurement and civilian form fillers.  That too is money that's not spent in Scotland but Scotland will have to find money for.

A lot of emphasis is placed on the rUK cost of relocating Faslane, but lack of redundancy flows two ways.  Every facility that is exclusively served in either Wales, England and/or Northern Ireland but not Scotland will now have to be rebuilt in Scotland; military colleges, specialised defence training estates.  They have the land, that's not an issue, but there's no costing.  It's also a lot more cost efficient per unit to train many, as opposed to few.  This is with Salmond promoting that they will bring back old units before addressing how they will be supported.

A LOT of the Scottish money that is spent in the rUK will still have to be reallocated in the new Scottish Armed Forces; what the White Paper says that it will take a £3.3bn spend, slash it by around a *THIRD* to around Denmark levels, *INCREASE* the number of troops.  It's okay for Denmark because they already have their facilities built, and now Scotland will also have to service its own Navy and Airforce without spreading the cost across a broader pool like the UK e.g. less cost efficient.  It goes without saying that a dry dock that services a dozen frigates is more cost efficient than one that has to be purpose built and maintained to service just two.  Where's the pricing for this initial short to mid term extra cost?  

And all that and Faslane on its own has just had a £3bn overhaul and by far one of the costliest installations in the UK, so the 10% claim to assets is looking particularly weak as they've already got a large slice of it, even if it's not the slice they wanted.  It's no little bit cheeky as you effectively  hand the rUK a £50bn bill to relocate, to then go cap in hand and ask for another £10bn in assets!

That.  That is why I stopped reading the White Paper after going through what I expected to include a defence review.  *We're in the last week of November and it appears that not a single person in the SNP has bothered to even approach MoD*.  This is it Scotland, *this* is your defence cost and effect analysis on independence, and they have let you massively down.  They've had years to plan this.   I firmly believe that Scotland is more than capable of making independence a success if it so wishes, but this is nothing short of incompetence.

true,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,"Apart from the fact that Scotland does contribute MPs to Westminister, while they are all of one party, when Labour is in power Scotland has quite a big say, or as big as any one area of the country can do. 

You're right that there is a disconnect between London and Scotland, but the same can be said for everywhere in the UK, not just Scotland (I live in the North of England, do you really think I feel Cameron &amp; Co are representing the needs of my area?).

Plus there's no evidence to suggest that an independent scotland will be any different. Once the SNP have achieved independence, the political spectrum will settle into a more ""traditional"" landscape (this usually happens with one issue parties) with a left and ring wing party. Over time it's entirely likely that Scottish people will see it as ""All the Prime Minister does is create policies for Edinburgh, not [wherever]"".

The argument that the Westminster Parliament is largely unelected by Scotland and that all decisions are made based on what's best for the City applies to the EU as well. You say at least Scotland can *argue* for it's point in the EU even if it doesn't have any real sway, but the SNP could be doing that in Westminster right now, but they don't. 

The exact same will happen in the EU. Some areas are veto-able (that's sadly not a word) by any country, in which Scotland will have the same say as anyone. The trend over the last 50 years though has been there are less and less areas where there is a veto able to be used and more where it is a vote, with voting strength based on population. It's called Qualified Majority Voting. In fact, every major treaty since the first has shifted at least one area away from a veto to voting.

There is the possibility of Europe backtracking in some of these areas (or so tory supporters and UKIP think) but if the trend continue Scotland will find itself with less and less of a say in it's own affairs.

To put it in perspective, Germany has 15% of the EU population, and gets 10% of the votes, the UK has 12% of the population and gets 8% of the votes.

Scotland has a population of 5.95 million, putting it somewhere between Ireland and Finland who have approximately 2% of the vote each despite having far less then 2% of the EU's population.  

If the UK were to lose 5 million of it's population, it would still have the 3rd highest population in the EU, and it seems unlikely that we would agree to losing 2% of our vote, so the odds are that the countries currently voting with more then their population's worth would be reshuffled to make room. 

This means the UK would retain a veto in the areas scotland had one (assuming it even got into the EU) but would also retain it's level of influence in votes. It may not seem like much at 8%, but when you consider it would take 4 countries of Scotland's size to agree on something to equal the UK's vote, maybe that puts it in perspective. 

To further put it in perspective, the SNP has 6 MPs, which is 0.92% of the Westminster Parliament. If you had 15 MPs, giving you close to 2%, would you feel better? Probably not I suspect, I know I wouldn't. 

EDIT: I also realise my responses are far longer then yours, and I do apologise for that. It's just odd to find someone for independence who's actually willing to listen to any of this without just saying ""You know nothing"" and ignoring me, so I want to make sure I explain myself properly.

By Kevin Stannard and Charles Williams. 

It has the feel of a traditional hymn but it was written in the 1980s. Stannard is currently the head of Music at Wolverhampton university and I presume is still composing. 

I always liked singing it as a child because it has a galloping waltz rhythm which matches the content of the lyrics. It also features the story of Herod murdering the innocents which is a good counter to all the schmaltz of the festive season. 

In performance it's usually done at a slow pace to suit choirs but we always used to sing it at breakneck speed until the final verse which would be dramatically drawn out. 

There's a few variations - with the lyrics simplified for schools. The version I learned was -- 

Kings came riding from the East

searching for the prince of peace

met King Herod, wicked man

schemed and plotted evil plan,

Herod told them find the babe

come and tell me where he's laid

I will go there kneel me down,

offer him my golden crown

but all he wanted was his blood

have that infant gone for good

hasty riding through the sand

Kings left Herod's desert land

true,Calavera190,scottish,Fife,"Sorry, but I feel that you simply mis-understand the realities of internal Scottish politics. For a start, the SNP are far from a one issue party, whilst independence may be their raison d'etre they also have a firm, left-wing platform strongly based upon the ideals of personal liberty and a pragmatic pacifism, very similar at time to Old Labour. This has shown itself through their economic policies, reverence of the Welfare State and continued anti-nuclear stance. Until now, it was known for many people who were not particularly in favour of independence to vote SNP anyway, because they agreed with their other policies and because the SNP were the only consistently competent political party in Scotland, due to all other main parties being little other than branches of the London parties (leading to nearly all politicians who where worth a damn being taken down to Westminster).

&gt;Over time it's entirely likely that Scottish people will see it as ""All the Prime Minister does is create policies for Edinburgh, not [wherever]"".

This is based upon the assumption that Scotland would automatically use the UK's (rather broken) system of government. For example, an independent Scotland could form a Senate and House of Representatives. In the former each area of Scotland could get two senators, regardless of population, and in the latter representatives could be elected by proportional representation. This would allow the desires of the majority to be recognised, whilst simultaneously protecting the interests of the minority, meaning that sparsely populated areas would feel less marginalised in terms of political power than the main belt.

Furthermore, in your explanation of how Scotland could, hypothetically, lose powers to Brussels you fail to mention a significant factor in Scotland's standing, it's relationship with other European countries, both EU and non-EU. For example, it highly likely that Scotland would increase relations with Scandinavia, possibly going so far as to gain acceptance into the Nordic Council. 

If this where to happen it would give the Nordic Council almost complete control of the Northern Atlantic, the Baltic (and therefore, the major Russian shipping lanes to Europe) and the North Sea (and with it the oil fields.) This would also give Scotland a good basis for forming a voting bloc with NC members who are also in the EU, namely Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as making it a close friend to Norway, whom the EU is fairly desperate to gain as a member. There's also the fairly obvious possibility of rUK making a common cause with Scotland should something arise that would pose a threat to both countries. 

As an Independent country, Scotland would be free to pursue these relationships, which it is not currently. 

Furthermore, the EU vote is much more fragmented than the UK vote. Scotland only has 10% of the MPs, faced with England's 84%. Taking into account party divides Scotland's MPs are even more split, as many MPs belong to parties other than the Big Three, and so cannot rely on cross country support from other MPs. Conversely, the Scottish MPs who *do* belong to the Big Three can have split loyalties, and can vote in the interests of the party, rather than Scotland.

Meanwhile, in the EU, the big hitters only have something like 30% of the vote, and that's assuming the UK, France and Germany all agree on the same action.",0,1385846657,null,0,false,0,cdqg3wg,t3_1rlhwm,t1_cdqg3wg,t1_cdqetkg,null,1428449349,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

1.the aircraft used as far as i can see was a police helicopter which use the EC-135 as far as i know which is a duel engine helicopter so either there was a blockage in the fuel system which prevented fuel being fed to the engines and causing NR droop and a fast decent

true,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; Sorry, but I feel that you simply mis-understand the realities of internal Scottish politics. For a start, the SNP are far from a one issue party, whilst independence may be their raison d'etre they also have a firm, left-wing platform strongly based upon the ideals of personal liberty and a pragmatic pacifism, very similar at time to Old Labour.

No I am aware that the SNP is more then a one issue party in terms of literally it is not just about a singular issue. What I mean is that The SNP will become like ""Scotland's version of Labour"" in the way it will be ""the left wing party"" or whatever. 

You are right I'm assuming that Scotland won't adopt a radically different system from the UK, which you may say is broken but can you name a system that isn't? Why would the current Scottish Parliament essentially dilute their own power by having a second chamber? It seems highly unlikely it would be a US style Senate system.

Even if it was, the perception that politicians make their decisions based on the needs of the people living in the capital is one common in nearly every democracy in the world, including ones with the system you described. I'm making the assumption that an independent Scotland will be no different to any other country, whereas the idea that for some reason Scotland's fledging new democratic system will someone not have the same results as everyone else's is a jump too big for me to believe. 

You're right about the EU being more fractured too, so I accept in theory countries with different interests could be split amoung more groups, however just remember that when in comes to influencing countries the bigger you military and economy is the more influence you are going to be. Plus the countries you listed in a NC bloc would equal approx 15% of the EU vote, but it would take 8 of you to get there, whereas the UK only needs Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Poland to actually gain a majority.

The idea that Scotland will somehow be *more* influential in the EU then it is under the British yolk or whatever just doesn't add up. There isn't a single situation where Scottish interests could not be better represented by the UK as a whole. You could argue that Westminster doesn't argue for Scottish interests enough, but you can say that about any part of the UK, not just Scotland.

Actually, very much. They started off with ""nobody dies"". And then about one episode in (from memory?) they started finding ways. Jack shredded by a bomb survives and regrows, but people in an incinerator don't regrow?

&gt; Though I was sorry to miss out on Benedict Cumberbatch doing Khan, I will probably catch that on TV sometime.

Heh. For me, *Star Trek* brought him down, not him bringing it up. And Simon Pegg... well, he sold himself for a nice price.

&gt; Did you watch Prometheus? I haven't seen it yet, what did you think?

Nice concept, which a) has been done before though and b) does much the same as *Doctor Who* - sacrifices story-sense for spectacle. I'm afraid Lawrence Miles was right and this is just the era we're in. People growing up now are just **like** this and maybe there's nothing that can be done for them.

&gt; I thought that John Hurt mocking the way that Ten and Eleven behave might be a sign that Moffat is going to change the tone slightly in future.

I'd like to, but the rest of the episode argues against it. I see it as more likely that Moffat was trying to play off the way the first three Doctors disliked each other.

A lot of federal subjects may also have similar issues, especially if the Government was not in London. Other than that however, yes, it would have been a good idea provided the Federal Government was quite weak and its laws stuck only to areas within its competence. I think any 19th Century British federation would violently break apart had it attempted the strong-arm federal model the US evolved into. There would be significant benefits, such as freedom of travel amongst the member nations, a strong sterling zone, uplifting of undeveloped members (SA) and free flow of capital. The population may well have ended up larger than 130million provided it could entice emigration from Europe and elsewhere while simultaneously making country membership attractive. It could very well have been a precursor to a British focused EU, had France sought to join in like it did post-ww2 OTL.

I think it could have been achieved, had the entire reason d'etre of empire been changed. Colonies were largely obtained for economic or military reasons. Had anyone had a more long term view then such a unification would be largely possible, or at the very least we'd still hold territories much on the same model as French DOM's. As it stood, all Anglo-origin nations attempted separation as soon as feasible, a reoccurring theme of our culture, most recently needlessly attempted in Scotland. Although, an empire with such a *manifest destiny* would likely have moved the capital and much of the populace to the North American East Coast very early in the game.

&gt;2. If a CANZUK nation was on the menu today would you support Britain joining it?

Without second thought, even at the cost of EU membership and/or economic hardship. We are culturally closer to the CW Realm than most EU nations, therefore it would be a more successful union.

&gt;3. A more realistic scenario - Would you support our politicians trying to foster closer economic and political ties with the commonwealth or would you prefer to stick with the European path?

I do not see why it needs to be either/or. We can have closer ties and maintain good commonwealth relations while being a proactive EU member (another bugbear of mine is how France and Germany play leading roles in the EU but we just sit back not being much more engaged than... Italy). What I do not understand however is why we cannot have at least a free travel area between us, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. More so, I don't understand why NZ and Australia are not in their own union. However the rest of the realm has no appetite for such a union, as then they lose their preferred EU operational base. For how long we've let this go, the only real way of achieving the end goal is to wait for the entire of Western Civilisation to merge into a single unit, likely on the US's capitalistic provocative. Perhaps triggering the EU to acquire members outside its borders would be the quickest method of allowing this to happen, but will no doubt alarm Washington who views the Anglosphere as it's primary allies, not anyone else's. More likely is that the rest of the realm falls into US orbit (NAFTA and the TPP is part of the start) and we are left in the EU to provide strategic access - a unfortunate temporal role for a nation that could have been at the helm.",0,1385850341,null,0,false,0,cdqhgj5,t3_1rshzn,t1_cdqhgj5,t3_1rshzn,null,1428448718,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Ah, okay, I'm in agreement with you there.

&gt; Why would the current Scottish Parliament essentially dilute their own power by having a second chamber? It seems highly unlikely it would be a US style Senate system.

Easy, to neutralise the disparity between the highly populated Central Belt and the sparsely populated Highlands and Islands, reduce the feeling of policy being made purely for the benefit of the seat of political power. Even without a new consitution, the sheer reduction in geographical distance would have this affect anyway.

You seem to think that the disquiet over the UK's centralisation is common to every country, and so is without basis. I can state catagorically that this is not the case. You only have to look at the figures; without London the UK is pretty average in terms of economic disparity between regions, *with* London the UK is one of the most economically divided countries in the Western world. The government spends £70 per person on culture in London, in England this sum is £5 per person.

&gt; UK only needs Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Poland to actually gain a majority.

Sorry, but if the UK can get all of those countries on side then it is going to be on an issue that Scotland would also be in favour of, that *all* members of the EU would be in favour of. The opinion of the UK within the EU is not particularly high to begin with. Even if such a situation arose, why would Poland risk falling out with the Baltic states, and possibly *Russia*, just so it could appease England? Your chosen countries are already far, far more different than those of the Nordic Council, which means that it is going to be far harder to find a consensus view. 

&gt; There isn't a single situation where Scottish interests could not be better represented by the UK as a whole. You could argue that Westminster doesn't argue for Scottish interests enough, but you can say that about any part of the UK, not just Scotland.

Easy, fishing rights. Westminster has previous given up Scottish fishing rights when asked by the EU, over English fishing rights. The motivation for doing this is easy, Scotland only has 52 MPs, and any minister who gave up English fishing rights could easily face a backlash from his own, English constituency; and from other regions of England as a whole. Because England has ten times the MPs of Scotland, the backlash could be anything as ten times as intense.

This argument is based upon the idea that Scotland's interests are concurrent with the interests Westminster protects, that of the City. This is not the case; for example, HS2. Scotland is being made to pay millions towards it, even though it is expected to drain £316 million from it's economy. Meanwhile, it is expected to make £3 billion for London. This is just one of many cases of Scotland's interests being damaged because Westminster wants to make an already grossly wealthy area of the country even richer, the area that happens to be where Parliament is based AMD where most MPs live, *or own property in*.

Another example is with the national debt. Scotland is being given a proportion of a debt that is mostly being rung up by other parts of the UK. One economist has calculated the amount the Union has cost Scotland, in this manner, to be £64 billion over 30 years.

Added to this is the UK's defence spending, leaving Scotland £1 billion out of pocket per annum, and with nothing to show for it other than the highest rate of MoD redundancies in the UK, the scrapping of historic regiments of immense local and national pride, dilapidated bases (Leuchars), the scrapping of profitable, popular airshows whicjh bring thousands to the local economy (Leuchars again), no surface Navy vessels permanently stationed Scottish waters, no capacity for naval territory patrols and, lest we forget, two aircraft carries *with no aircraft*.

In short, I have seen nothing concrete to suggest that, by becoming an independent nation, Scotland would have less of a say in the EU or that it would be demonstrably worse off.",0,1385850636,null,0,1385851643,0,cdqhkga,t3_1rlhwm,t1_cdqhkga,t1_cdqglho,null,1428448667,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"Interesting thought, are you asking the question in a legal sense or are you just posing an ethical or moral question? If it's in a legal sense, I am not a lawyer but I'm certain that a hypothetical car thief would not be charged with manslaughter. 

As for should he be charged. Consider you're having a party, and your neighbor calls the police with a noise complaint. The police are involved in a collision on the road while on their way to you, for arguments sake, let's say it is a mechanical failure which causes the accident (as it was most likely a mechanical failure which caused the helicopter to crash). So it wasn't a driver error. The policemen in the car are killed, as well as the people in the car they hit. Do you think this is the fault of yourself for making too much noise at your party? What about your neighbor for calling the noise complaint? if they hadn't have called the police, the accident would not have happened.

I think too often people are too preoccupied with finding who's at fault and punishing them for it. It's part of human nature to want there to be simple, black and white reasons for everything that happens, but this is never the case. Personally I don't agree with a punishment based justice system, I believe we should focus instead on rehabilitation and prevention. If you share this view then the answer to ""Should the car thief be blamed for the deaths?"" is clearly no. If he was to be blamed in a rehabilitative based system, then we would be foolishly wasting time making sure he doesn't repeat his ""offense"" of causing helicopters to drop out of the sky. When in fact we should instead focus on stopping them from stealing again. Of course if your view is of a punishment based system, you probably would want to charge him.

What or where is the cost evaluation?   THAT'S what an independence white paper should address; as it is it seems that they're imposing what they think will be good for the UK in their own opinion and expecting the armed forces chiefs to simply agree.

Realistically you're talking about an Olympic bid endeavour to get up to speed (and we all know how they quickly tend to exceed budgets).  Even if it's not going to be a long term outlying cost you're still talking billions getting up to speed.  That all requires financing, and factoring into the cost of independence, because that's going to cut into other spending and increase the immediate borrowing/deficit.

Then there's the staff appraisals to look at.  It's all very well saying that the Scots are over represented per head of population in the current armed forces (which they are), but where are the figures?  Because Scotland is disproportionately over represented in infantry, but what of the specialist support services which the infantry can't operate without?  How many Scottish serving forces in other regiments will be willing to serve in a Scottish Armed force, and are there enough?   What about the admiralty and the MoD?  It's not enough to say that we take 10% and then we'll have an operational capability at ~10% of the current UK.  It has to be operational.  You can't take 10% from an operating car engine and still expect to have the working parts for a smaller engine.  You're liable to have a pile of dysfunctional car parts.

I'm not saying an independent Scotland couldn't have an operational Defence Force - of course they could.  I was expecting a thorough defence analysis though!  It didn't happen.

Let alone we've not addressed that if an independent Scotland expects ~10% of the greater rUK assets, then it should surely follow that the rUK would expect ~90% of current Scottish UK MoD assets!  Where's the costing for that, too?   I don't support the UK being miserly about it, but I expect some fair reasoning.  At the very least if Scotland is going to continue using places like Sandhurst or the Royal Military College at Shrivenham then they'll be expected to pay as an independent, and Salmond has just stricken that particular budget as being outside Scotland and so sacrificial.

There's been virtually no costing or appraisal of exactly what level of capability Scotland will need to deliver.

Less developed nations were never intended to be part of a hypothetical federation at least in the short term. Most of East Africa would continue to be run as colonies as would places like Malaysia, Burma, Guyana etc. India was controversial in the federation arguement because their sheer numbers would overwhelm any sort of Imperial parliament unless they're votes were to count less than white votes - something they would obviously not stand for for long.

If you look at the political situations in the late 1800's and early 1900's (particularly the imperial conferences that were held) you will find that the people of the white dominions were quite willing to accept closer integration to the homeland, in fact it was often the case that they were the ones pushing for it not British MP's.
