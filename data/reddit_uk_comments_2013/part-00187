true,Vaneshi,cnty-england,Midlander trapped in Hampshite,"&gt; The business diversity in virtually every small town neighbourhood across the country is being strangled by national chains.

Which really is the law of unintended consequences hitting full force IMHO.  Councils didn't want the traffic the high street demands so all those out of town supermarkets (and malls like Blue Water, etc.) are just awesome.  But in reality they didn't want the traffic but they really wanted the rent a high street shop costs and the fees they get from parking charges. 

Honestly if I were setting up a business I'd look to see how much rent Tesco, ASDA, et al wanted and put a nail saloon or hair dressers right next to the Opticians and COSTA rather than the high street.  I am seriously surprised Supercuts or another large chain hasn't already done so.

But you want to know what's slaughtered the highstreet?  The internet.  All those niche stores; the model shop, the quirky clothes store, the indie fashion designers store and the book shop?  They're websites now.  Even to the point of exclusively selling via 'super market' sites like ebay, amazon marketplace, etsy and in China aliexpress. 

To steal a quote from the debate on video game piracy: How do you compete with free?  Because that's what the high street has got to beat, it costs so little to throw up a website, engage an SEO or cheaper still plug-in to Amazon that the councils need to beat that with the high street locations. 

If you can figure out a way to make the high street competitive against that then you'll start to get those quirky small stores opening again.   But if you can't then it's charity shops all the way down.

Until Amazon buys one to shove full of lockers. ",0,1378559982,null,0,false,0,cc3j4on,t3_1lwhp5,t1_cc3j4on,t1_cc3h3r7,null,1429559675,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Without an idea of how much cannabis would cost and what licences would be required I can't build a business plan. I do however have the concept worked out. 

During the day I would operate primarily as a coffee shop incorporating a second hand bookstore. I would allow people to sit and read without buying the books so long as the purchased drinks or food. 

In the evenings I would host live jazz music and offer a selection of cannabis deserts, targeting people post dinner. You'd come along select an edible ( offered at different strengths) then you'd relax as it kicks in and enjoy some live music. 

If possible I would also sell cannabis in an off licence way and for smoking on the premises. However I would ban tobacco all smoking would need to be from pure rolls, pipes, or water pipes. 

I would attempt to offer a range of quality and strengths as well as oils and harsh. I would have a medicinal range which would low in THC, less of a high more pain relief. 

Ultimately I'd hope to grow my own cannabis to ensure proper quality controls. 

I'd look towards also opening a glass store selling pipes and accessories and hopefully my own glass blowing studio where people could learn to make there own. I'd hopefully go into partnership with an experienced glass blower (most likely from the US) for this and offer apprenticeships.     

I'd also like to expand and introduce a small cinema where people could get high and enjoy a film, I'd also provide popcorn with cannabis butter.

If there was an issue over smoke I'd concentrate on vaporisers and edibles, of course that would mean a no to the glass shop / studio.

* MUST have practical experience working with BIG enterprise systems processing millions of online and offline transactions

Well we needed them, as Carra has gone, Skrtel last season was awful, and Coates is terrible and injured.

true,nowonmai666,lfc99,null,"&gt;  I find it interesting that Rogers has elected to buy three central defenders in the transfer window

We needed them: we scraped through last season because Agger defied his previous injury record and because Carragher was better than we thought he would be in his final season.

I think there's open competition for the centre-back places, although Agger has a head start and Skrtel a bit of handicap in that Rodgers doesn't fancy him.

Henderson and Shelvey have proved that Rodgers is willing to change his mind over the course of a season (this time last year, Shelvey was the golden boy and Rodgers was annoyed at Henderson for not accepting a transfer), so Skrtel still has a chance. He needs to overcome his confidence crisis and consistently play with the authority he did against Man Utd, and maybe he'll have everybody saying ""why *did* Liverpool buy all those centre-backs.

Toure is Carra's immediate replacement. He brings the experience and leadership that Carra had; he's reliable, an established Premiership player with experience of winning things. Coming in at the beginning of the window, he was the bare minimum we needed to make sure the team would be in no worse shape starting this season than ending the last. The amazing thing is how deeply and profoundly Liverpool has fallen in love with this beautiful man. I think we might have got a bit more than we bargained for.

Sakho is a big money signing and the man Rodgers sees as a first choice central defender in years to come. I don't actually know that much about him, but it's OK if he takes some time to bed in because he's one of 4.

Agger is arguably the most over-rated defender in the world. I don't know what's stopping him from achieving his potential, but I still hold out hope that Rodgers will get the best out of him (and then he will be the best in the world). What I'm getting at is that he doesn't always do the things we know he is capable of, which is order other players around, really attack the ball in the air, and bring out the ball as much as we know he can. We see flashes of greatness, but not 90 minutes every game. he's still one of the best in the league, but he should be *the* best.

Agger's response to rumours that Man City wanted to sign him for silly money was to get YNWA tattooed on his knuckles. He similarly shrugged off interest from Barcelona this summer. And do you remember how he chinned Torres the first time he played against us? Agger is one of the players who has a really strong bond with the fans, and will be forgiven a multitude of sins. We like him quite a lot.

I'm not sure Ilori will necessarily be used in the centre-back position. He has the attributes to play in a few roles, and I'd be interested to see him in the sort of role Rafa had David Luiz playing in, or perhaps alongside Lucas.

We also have some excellent young players who are probably going to make the transition from full-back to centre-back. Andre Wisdom needs little introduction, and is now out on loan to make his early mistakes in somebody else's shirt. Martin Kelly is back from a nasty injury, and while he's always done a good job on the right, his physique seems more suited to a position in the middle. 


&gt;Who do you think will be Rogers' choices to start?

Agger and Sakho are the pairing Rodgers sees as his first choice, although he may also favour a horses-for-courses approach if he feels Toure is better equipped against certain opponents.

Also, I know everyone thinks of Rodgers as a 4-3-3 man, but he is clearly intrigued by the idea of 3 at the back. I expect to see him tinker with this, especially in games where we start badly and he needs to change something just for the sake of change.

&gt; And another question, are you happy with getting Moses on loan?

I didn't like Moses as a Wigan player, and somehow didn't manage to see much of him playing for Chelsea, although his comments on his transfer are very encouraging and professional.

I'm not sure how much we'll use him. When we play away from home, we often sit deep and counterattack (especially in the second half) and Moses is just the kind of player you want making runs for Coutinho's long passes. He'll be an upgrade on Raheem Sterling in that role, I suppose.

Although we don't usually play with wingers, relying on full-backs for with and making more use of the inside-forward positions, it is good to have somebody adept in that role in the squad.",0,1378566729,null,0,false,0,cc3kjrm,t3_1lwr7e,t1_cc3kjrm,t3_1lwr7e,null,1429559013,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

Yes of course it is.

But to play devil's advocate here, if you are capable of working you are expected to find a job. You can't just say I don't like working so I'll just have benefits instead, please.

By the same logic you can't just find a Saturday job and say, that's all I want to do, I don't want to work more than one day a week, give me my benefits and leave me alone. You are expected to find more hours.

Of course, this all breaks down somewhat when there isn't any work for people to do. But in principle, people on benefits who do very few hours should be looking for more work, just the same as people who don't have a job at all.

(Obviously, taking account of any genuine circumstances which limit your working hours).

I don't earn anything for bringing traffic to the site. I'm a self-employed journalist who gets paid a flat fee every month. I'm not paid enough to set up multiple phone lines and post about them.

You're right, the phone number is one that can be used for virtual offices. I'm sure it is a computer playing a message.

I have a long history of using Reddit to answer questions about my articles. You can check my posting history if you don't believe me.

That's not why the doctor chooses companions. He doesn't look for the smartest, brightest human who can think quickly and help him out of situations. That's his job.

The doctor picks companions because they are fascinated with the universe and have a certain natural curiosity and inquisitiveness. Every time a new companion is introduced, these are the things he picks up on and laughs/smiles at. 

This is why Rose was the best companion, and the Doctor's favorite. She was the only one that was truly in love with the universe like he was. She was heartbroken when they were separated, not only because he was gone, but because she was cut off from exploring the universe, banished to working in a shop.

The author states they have a bunch of backup numbers, but when some foreign government discovers the first number, are they not going to start listening to phonecalls for the Lincolnshire Poacher jingle?

If you're a government and you're buying a telephone exchange, for a city of a million+ people or to handle international phonecalls, then I'm sure every telephone exchange you can buy off the shelf from Nokia or Siemens these days (and for the last decade) has the facility to record every call to hard-disk.

Given a million telephone recordings on hard-disk, a first year comp sci student could write a program to look at the first 20 seconds of each of them and match with the Lincolnshire Poacher jingle.

So initiating some *actually* secret messages with that music seems pretty questionable to me. This not to mention the ease of finding recordings which contain only spoken numbers, all in the same voice. They can't break the code, but this will help them locate hypothetical spies.

On the other hand, everyone knows there's a big army base and barracks at Aldershot, as well as the civilian town - consider how little it would cost to buy or rent 20 or 100 Aldershot phone numbers; it's free to reconfigure your Asterisk VoIP server to play this recording you made of the original numbers radio station.

There are probably plenty of idle sys admins running VoIP services companies who could set up a hoax like this without difficulty.

You do realise that most of what you are listening to is the equivalent of listening to soldiers doing radio checks while out on patrol.

**Schurlle:** Deserves at least 1-2 points better, scored like what, 19 goals last season in the bundesliga

**KDB:** Had an absolutely amazing season on loan and won the young bundesliga player of the year award deserves at least 83-84

**Hazard:** Deserves 86, he had a great first season and to say that he is 3 points worse then Silva is embarrassing

**Oscar:** Also deserves at least a 83-84, very very good player and has consistently shown it.

**David Luiz:** Deserves so much better, an 84 would have been fair, one of my favorite and best defenders in the EPL with his overall play, matured so much more and has developed into a player that is atleast equal to Dante (which accorinding to fifa dante is 3points better), especially since he has been pushing Dante out of the Brazil squad

**Overall:** After looking at other teams we have been scalped to much by these rating.

Somewhere I really like to eat is The Dogs on Hanover street, there are actually two sister restaurants next to each other, Amore Dogs (italian style dishes, my fave) and The Dogs, which is more traditional/british with local ingredients. They are informal/trendy/quirky with good prices for really nice food (I reckon about 35 quid each for three courses and a couple of drinks if you are having a full evening meal but they serve really good food all day for less). Not as swanky as I suppose the Dome is but its smart enough for a first date without being too formal and unrelaxing.

I have noticed that about the Liverpool fans' growing affection for Toure. I'm assuming you saw the story from the other day about his offering (jokingly, but still) to change his last name after a fan had it tattooed incorrectly?

Sakho, from what I've learned, is a good, powerful centre back, but has had some past issues while at PSG...I'll try and find the article that mentioned this.

As I previously said, I just wish we had a few more centre backs as good as Agger.

[Here's a link of Moses' performance against Inter for us in pre-season.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ecw5Xi04xaU) He was very impressive.

Ninja edit: Found the bit about Sakho...here's a direct copy from the transfer deadline day coverage on the BBC.

&gt;France football writer Matt Spiro: ""Mamadou Sakho's Liverpool switch has upset a lot of PSG supporters. Paris born and bred, the centre-back is a PSG fan and was the last survivor of a promising generation that graduated from the academy six years ago.

&gt;""Having first captained the club aged 17, many hoped he'd develop the kind of relationship with PSG that Paolo Maldini enjoyed with AC Milan.

&gt;""His status changed, though, when Carlo Ancelotti arrived and expressed concerns over his weight. Thiago Silva replaced Sakho as captain, and when the Brazilian said he'd rather partner his compatriot Alex, a lengthy spell on the bench ensued. The 23-year-old cut his losses when another Brazilian centre-back, Marquinhos, was signed from AS Roma.

&gt;""With the World Cup approaching, Sakho, who was first-choice for his country for much of last season, will be desperate to play regularly at Anfield.

&gt;""My feeling is he will be a big hit. While he has been more error-prone than usual in the last two seasons, he has speed, power, aggression and tremendous aerial presence, often intimidating his opponents. If Brendan Rodgers can keep him in good shape, Sakho has the potential to become one of the best defenders in England.""",0,1378575740,null,0,false,0,cc3n3x9,t3_1lwr7e,t1_cc3n3x9,t1_cc3kjrm,null,1429557745,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

Luiz I think, like many, belongs in midfield, and Ivanovic seems to get played at RB a lot. I'm just enjoying for the first time in a long time actually having depth in a squad, as over the past 10 years that's always been a problem.

I wasn't that impressed when we got him, but his performances made me reconsider. I saw him as an ok experienced backup before, now he's more than that. I think Sakho left them as they had Thiago Silva as the Number 1, and just paid a load for Marquinhos, so Sakho didn't want to play second fiddle. We capitalised like you say, and I'm very happy that we did!

It's a tough decision, but for a 23 year old, he has 151 club appearances and 14 caps. I'm willing to put him ahead of Toure for that, but it's great we have Toure as an option. With Agger being experienced in the big games also it's probably better for us long term.  These are the sorts of issues I like having as a fan though!

Yeah, if he can dribble as well it's a bonus. I think in a team which plays passing football a little too much at times, it'll be good to see someone more willing to run at at full back and beat him than pass it through, can stop us being stale.

I liked the old flumes, I prefer drops when I'm on my front and being pitch black and on my back makes me experience the dropping sensation badly.

Pool was alright, I feel the waves are rather rough seeing how much smaller it is. Before, I could let the waves carry me to shore but here the ground was rough and thought it could smack me into the floor. Rapids seemed okay, though I preferred the elevated version in the old one where you could watch people going around it from a  higher semi pool/bath. I did feel like I struggled to go round while floating around because some jets would push me down and I liked the relaxed floating around of it. I'd imagine if I was younger the smaller pool with the water spouts would appeal to me more. It's a shame they wasted money on a large bucket which fills itself and tips water down the frame every now and then, I'd rather they spent money on something cool like another water cannon or something. The yellow flume, which I went on before at the old pool, is absolutely terrifyingly claustrophobic although that's just my personal preference. It was so tight I banged my head on the top once.

I think one issue is that it's catering to swimming clubs, people doing lengths and diving in addition to the slides and leisure funs.

Compared to the Oasis in Swindon, of which the eponymous band named themselves after, it's not as good. You had three large flumes which I could lie on my front and they felt more fun and intense with a large pool you landed in (larger than the one in the old Dundee pool). There is a massive wave pool which they had large thick floating mats you could lie on. There were four orange water slides which went into the wave pool. There is also an open flume which goes over the wave pool. I think my experience of this has meant my impressions of all other pools I've been to in the UK aren't as good.

true,NibblyPig,english,Bristol,"You were saying the economy should benefit us, and my response was just to say that if you make a poor decision you cannot blame the economy for the consequences, eg. if you go to university ""for fun"" ie. do a subject you think will be interesting, rather that to learn a skill you can get a job with, then when you graduate and are competing for jobs that others with relevant degrees have (eg. you want to be an English teacher but you studied philosophy, you're going to be competing with people who studied English).

I don't think your unemployment at this stage is directly caused by the economy. The economy doesn't benefit you at that point and you go onto minimum wage because of your own decisions. So any bailout at that point is going to fall upon those who were more responsible and studied something like computer science and got a job in it.

Student loans are very much free money, and due to the way they don't increase much (low interest) they are costing the government large sums of money, not to mention various grants and other benefits for people from low-income backgrounds.

If I'm paying for it I think I have a right to decide which subjects and fields are important, although obviously indirectly through our democracy, but no such system exists at the moment so people are free to study a worthless subject and then go onto jobseekers allowance because they and all the other graduates that did the same thing are all applying for the same unskilled job at starbucks and complaining about how it's unfair.

It's not the whole picture, but it's a part of it, namely that you are responsible in part for going through 18 years of your life without picking up an in demand skill despite all of the opportunities afforded to you, not only at university, but also through the entire education system which is funded by the taxpayer.

Well put.

He certainly brings a more direct aspect to a team's play, and as you say that's not a bad thing, so long as it doesn't interrupt the fluidity of the team's play. For example, Nicolas Anelka was a very good player for us. However, when we still played that counter-attacking style football a lot a few years ago, which is epitomised by direct play, he would always slow down the game and really stop the fluidity and purpose of the attack, giving the opposition time to get back into position.

1) Get an UK iTunes account. You accomplish this goal by attempting to download a free app (e.x. [BBC iPlayer](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bbc-iplayer/id416580485?mt=8) on the UK App Store, which gives you the freedom to select ""None"" as a payment and thus enabling you to download any app that is only available in the UK App Store. (see: BBC iPlayer)

2) Download [Tunnelbear](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tunnelbear-vpn/id564842283?mt=8) or any other free VPN app from the app store. If you are already in the possession of a VPN service skip this step.

3) Download aforementioned [BBC iPlayer](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bbc-iplayer/id416580485?mt=8) on your iDevice. The iPlayer has an unique ability which gives you the power to download any program and store it on your said iDevice to up to 30 days.

4) Connect to the VPN service of your choice. If you're using a free VPN service it will likely have a data cap, which is why you shall be using iPlayer's unique feature to get around this obstacle. If your VPN service doesn't have a data cap, skip directly to step 7.

5) Hit download on the programs that you want to watch later. (e.x Doctor Who, QI, BBC docus, Mock the Week,... etc.)

6) Disconnect from VPN so you don't exceed the quota of your VPN service (e.x. 500MB on Tunnelbear).

I'm happy with Mignolet so far anyways, he's been good but I still can't help getting nervous during corners or when he's on the ball, hopefully over the season that will go away. In time, I hope he becomes as important of a character as Reina was.

And again we episode hasn't aired. Maybe the events of the eppy don't screw the order. In the last episode itself, the Doctor clearly states that Hurt is not the Doctor in terms of title. It is him but he is not considered by the Timelord to be the Doctor. But technically he is the Doctor. 

Also why does this have to be said. They don't need to introduce the Valeyard. They don't need to reference the limit. 


Peter Capaldi is the 12th Doctor because the BBC said he was. The show could say the Doctor regenerated 2500 times during the timewar.........doesn't change BBC calling him the 12th. 


Also freaking spoilers. Why would BBC say his technical number? The BBC isn't going to give it away about where Hurt is placed. ",0,1378580002,null,0,false,0,cc3ofdf,t3_1lwd3b,t1_cc3ofdf,t3_1lwd3b,null,1429557130,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"a muslim lol, no I'm not a muslim. 

I'm presenting a theory, 

A theory based on three things 

A theory based on the idea that the security state is heavily involved in extremist organisations, which we know to be true, Mark Kennedy is an example and he has said that there are others out there.

A theory based on the idea that in order to attract extremists into their zone of knowledge security services would need to set up honeypot organisations in order to draw them in, in order to deal with the radicals you have to find the radicals, what better way to do that than to create a radical organisation. This is a theory.

A theory that states that at various times states have used far right extremist organisations to do their dirty work. Well we know this to be true from operation Gladio which ran for forty years, saw numerous terrorist attacks on the European mainland including two train bombings. Well this happened and the agents involved and the far right operatives involved admitted to and exposed this operation which was done during the cold war to alienate the far-left, the fifth column within Europe back in the early 80s. Our own states were committing terrorist attacks against their own people, actually not conspiracy at all but fact. 

So could the EDL and the likes of Islam4UK have both been set up by our security services to create a strategy of tension, its my belief that that is not just possible but probably likely and thats because there is historical precedent of the far right being used for nefarious purposes. If you want to create a strategy of tension you need two sides fighting each other.

You might say the same for nuclear.

The reason you should pay the premium for nuclear is the same you should for wind. Because it helps to reduce carbon emission, and because it's not sensible to rely entirely on imported LNG shipped in from Qatar, which might triple in price overnight.

&gt; Until we invent some manner of better storage we are wasting our time on these token efforts.

That's why I hedged it in terms of a low penetration rate. You might just as well say the French are stupid for relying 70% on nuclear, because the power plants can't be scaled to meet peak demand, and you're not able to store the energy generated at non-peak times of the day and night. Certain technologies have different appropriate penetration rates on the grid, and onshore wind is a no-brainer at low rates.

Big business has a vested interest in ensuring the demand for jobs outstrips supply. By forcing workers to compete for jobs, salaries and working conditions can be slashed, thus boosting profits.

Government's war on the poor has nothing to do with helping people get back to work and everything to do with increasing competition for jobs even further by making life hell for people who are on benefits. The idea is to create enough desperation that everyone will apply for every job and if they manage to land a minimum wage, zero hour contract they will count themselves lucky.

I think the 'theme' is that you're on a boat going up and down river stopping at ports, not that that's important.

You need a deck of cards and a supply of booze, works best with 4 people.

Give everyone 4 cards which go face up in front of them - suit is not important, only the value/jack/queen etc.

Go up the river: Place one card in the middle of the table, this is the first port. Ignoring suit, everyone who has this card takes one drink - so if it's a 7, and you have a 7 in front of you then have one drink. If you have two 7s then drink twice.

Next port: Put another card down, this is the second port. Anyone with this card has two drinks. Two cards with mean four drinks, three would mean six.

Port three: As above, but three drinks if you have the card

Forth port: Take a guess.

Now head down the river: Put a card on top of the 'Forth Port' card. Anyone with this card has 4 drinks to hand out as they wish - 3 to Alice and 1 to Bob, 4 to Charlie, we all have one, whatever.

Back to the third port: 3 drinks to hand out per card.

Back to second: 2 drinks.

And back to the first: 1 drink.

Now you give everyone another card, so they should now have 5 cards in front of them.

Go up and down the river again, give everyone an additional card then they get back to the first port.

We found that with four people going through the deck twice (resetting everything when you run out of cards) was a pretty good game length and got everyone sufficiently oiled.",0,1378588875,null,0,false,0,cc3r6af,t3_1lx4qk,t1_cc3r6af,t3_1lx4qk,null,1429555848,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2

ManCity is finding their feet and are having to deal with defensive problems and stars looking to settle. ManUnited aren't looking so good without Mr. Ferguson. Chelsea also not firing on all cylinders.

Our defence is hopefully getting better with Skrtle stepping up to the challenge from the new players. Gerrard looks in great shape and Lucas is getting closer to 100%. Henderson is becoming very reliable with his energy and improving tactical awareness. And Allen looks to have recovered from the shoulder injury of last season.

Sturridge is probably the best striker on form in the PL at the moment and that's with him still not 100%. In my estimation, Aspas will probably be in the running for LFC player of the season at the end of this season.

I am optimistic because we now have genuine competition in almost every position. Additionally, we have great talent on the starting XI and the bench. Add to that the mentality the team has shown in the first 4 matches(yes I'm counting Notts Cty), we should be formidable.
Almost forgot Mignolet!

Once someone puts down three of a kind they pick up a spoon and everyone else also tries to get a spoon, the one without has to do a shot of something rather strong.

I have a good friend in norn iron i talk to all the time and we compare things like this all the time. being here in america i went to public school in the sex ed years, which were fourth grade (10 years old) and then again in high school in tenth grade where your 15-16. The sex ed in fourth grade was a week long. They separated the boys from the girls and taught us about the basic stuff, like how our bodies work and menstruation and some basic sex stuff like stds and pregnancy. No religious aspect at all in thanks to separation of church and state. Its in high school they go into condoms, birth control, even self awareness and date rape and how to prevent it. There is some discussion on abortion in that they teach us about it and what it is and the laws concerning it. They also show us the birth videos and the std pictures and try to scare us off it. Though in general by the time a lot of us were in that grade we were already having sex. I remember parents getting pissed cause they gave us free condoms at school and you could always get them from the nurse anytime. I didnt lose my virginity til 17 and my friends thought it was kind of old for me to still have not had sex. We are so sex obsessed it seems in this country that something like sex ed is kind of a joke. These kids are starting younger and younger and you see generations of young single parents having kids in high school and right out of it. I know there are parts of the country that are super rural bible thumping small towns where things arent like it is in a large metropolitan city like here. But in general we are pretty well educated in comparison to NI and have access to things like free contraception and more emphasis on parent involvement and athome sex education.

Is it possible? Obviously it is as it is theoretically trying every known combination in the universe.    

Another common name for a ""brute force"" attack is ""exhaustive key search"" meaning try every single key imaginable. So, yes, a brute force attack will work just fine on OTP because a brute force attack doesn't give a crap how the key was derived.

Doesn't really matter. It is very easy to hide encrypted information so it looks completely innocuous to any observer.    

For just one example, someone visits a flickr or imgur album, how are you going to determine if the photos they view are clean or have encrypted information carefully interwoven into the image in such a way so they cause no visual distortion? Unless you either have the original image to contrast or know the routine used to store that information within the image it is damn near impossible to either [prove that this information exists or to extract it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography#Example_from_modern_practice).   

&gt; It is also relatively easy to compromise or trace internet usage.    

Yes, very easy. But also just as easy to hide something right in the open. You could deliver your spy messages to millions of people (e.g. embed it into NYTimes.com's homepage) but only the correct receiver could decrypt it.   

&gt; Radio broadcasts are by definition untraceable to the receiver.

The leader is an idiot anyway. Bear in mind he just got out of prison for using a friend's passport to travel through an airport.

But even if it was a honey pot, the EDL isn't even far right to begin with. It's a single issue organisation, it doesn't push any fascist or third position arguments. In fact, Tommy Robinson is apparently in favour of multiculturalism and gay rights.

So I'm not sure exactly what MI5 would be interested in, unless they wanted to track some of the skinheads who tag along with the EDL.

Basically you need to look at your salary, put it into http://listentotaxman.com/ to calculate how much you will have left after income tax, national insurance and student loan repayments.

Then take your remaining salary (let's say £1600 per month) and subtract a set amount that you want to save (say £300-400 per month). Now put that money aside and pretend that you never had it in the first place. That is the best mentality, otherwise you end up 'creeping' into your savings.

Best place to put it is probably the best high street savings account you can find. You could start an ISA, and there's certainly no real downside, but whether it's really worth the bother depends on how much £ you have and how much you are likely to earn in the future. It also depends on whether you are likely to need to dip into the savings (since ISA transfers are one way only, so if you put money in and take it out, you've used your allowance but not saved).

true,nowonmai666,lfc99,null,"&gt; Interesting point about Henderson and Shelvey...were you happy with Rogers' decision to sell the latter?

Yeah, I think (and hope) Shelvey will turn into a decent player, but it wasn't going to happen at Liverpool. In our three Premier League games so far, we've been hanging on to a league and Shelvey at his best would have been a great asset to bring on, but he has so little experience you don't know whether he's going to provide the high octane performance you want or get sent off. He needs time at a club where being awesome one game in three is enough. I'd have been pleased with a loan to a the right kind of club (and Swansea would have qualified!).

As a Chelsea fan, you know how hard it is to bring players through when they really need experience before they become reliable enough to trust (I feel we're reaping the benefit from your failure to get that right with Sturridge, who it seems just needed to feel somebody had faith in him).

Those are nice words about Sakho. I feel at times that Rodgers is willing to concede a weakness in certain aspects of defence in favour of having real footballers in those positions. The ""traditional"" English defender is still valuable, but fewer and fewer teams are lumping the ball in to the big man. We're not playing against John Fashanu any more - the powerful forwards of 2013 want the ball at their feet (for the most part, and we have our 3 points at home from Stoke already). Liverpool's defensive traditions bring to mind guided tours around Ron Yeats, but we also had the Hansen/Lawrenson partnership and don't let their awful performance as pundits fool you. You don't need to big to defend.

That, I hope, is where Sakho will help us, as the guy who nips out of a defensive position to make a challenge. Agger and Skrtel both let people come on to them more than i would like. Your lot could do with something similar, I think.

You can verify this by calling 01252 230608, which is the supposed ""MI6"" number plus 1 - you'll hear a recorded message thanking you for calling Simon Mason. Case closed.

But if that's not enough to convince you that this is a hoax, then consider the following:

* The only source for this story is one anonymous email tip.
* Anyone with a reasonable level of technical knowledge could set this up within a few hours at little expense.
* It doesn't make operational sense. The act of listening in to a radio frequency is passive and almost impossible to trace; that's why number stations have always operated via radio. Calling a telephone number is the opposite: active, and highly traceable. If this number was real, any spy who called it would be exposed immediately.
* The text some people have received after calling the number is another giveaway. Number stations aren't ""restricted""; anyone can listen to them by design. Besides, does anyone really believe that MI6 *texts* people who call their secret numbers, asking them not to do it again?
* The guy who reported this story, James Cook, admitted in the comments that his source could have set the whole thing up.
* He also says that the source ""made claims that tally with the finds of primary research made by established experts in numbers stations."" Guess who's one of those experts? Simon Mason.
* Later on, he called his own source material into question: ""There are various parts of published and unpublished material that may have been confused with real intelligence.""
* Finally, he refused to answer any of my questions after I called him out on the above. If that's not a red flag, I don't know what is.

I suspect he originally got duped into writing this story, but has since realised it's a hoax. If so, he has no integrity because it hasn't been retracted. If not, he's just naive.

He is like a kid in a candy store playing that role, and his love for his job and the fanbase that he is 100% part of really shines through in his performance.

Secondly, Tennant is a phenomenal actor in his own right.  Part of my love for Ten came from the other shows and videos I watched Tennant act in.  If you can find *Single Father,* watch it.  Also, go watch Tennant's soliloquy from Hamlet on YouTube.  He has so much depth and investment in his roles, it's unbelievable.

Thirdly, I like how Tennant made the Doctor kind of manic and goofy (akin to Matt Smith,) but I think Ten just had a better developed subtext compared to Eleven.  There was a lot said in the things Ten *never* said, but Tennant managed to put it all in his body and face.  Those moments where you could tell he was bristling, or at war with himself when a companion asked a seemingly innocuous question about the Doctor all belonged to Tennant.  It's why I cried so much during Tennant's seasons: his Doctor was so mercurial.  He went from ""Hello! I'm the Doctor!"" all the way to ""I'm the winner...The Time Lord Victorious.""

Rosenborg, a small football club from trondheim in norway, beat AC Milan to get to the quarter finals of the champions league.
They beat Real Madrid on Lerkendal(their home stadium).

They had the record for most League titles in a row; 13, which is now tied with a Latvian team i believe.

They are one of the teams who have qualified most for the CL.

They have 22 league titles, nine cup titles, and one inter-toto cup title.

Altough they are more consistent in the league than Liverpool, they have such a rich history i Europe, which reminds me of Liverpool.

Truly one of the greats in my opinion, altough i'm biased.

Re the jobs argument, there are a couple of answers to that, off the top of my head. Firstly, that the companies we've already mentioned - Pharma, in particular - are well placed to create jobs in this sector should legalisation come to pass. As I've said, massive opportunity. Secondly, the law enforcement jobs that already pursue petty drug crime would surely be far better employed chasing other crimes... crimes with poor arrest and conviction rates. Rape and sexual assault spring to mind: in both the US and the UK, and many other western first world countries, these sorts of crimes are often investigated laxly, pursued poorly and the results are dreadful. 

To your point about drug convictions and employment, yes, but that wasn't really the point I was making: I was looking at it from the law enforcement side, not the plaintiff's side.

Is the EDL far right? if it wasn't to begin with it soon became so by the very fact that the leadership were known far right activists besides the EDL was set up as opposed to islamic extremism, a cause that very few would disagree with, however the original definition by its own spiritual guru back in 2009 was all muslims are extremists. Condemning and attacking a minority community is grist to the mill for far right extremism. 

It was originally set up by Paul 'lionheart' Ray.

Paul Ray's view was that all muslims are extremists because:

*""the Qu’ran teaches all its advocates to wage jihad or holy war in non-Muslim countries, and acknowledged that on this basis, all devout or practising Muslims in Britain, are – in his words – “at war with our country.”*

*""“They’re ultimately engaged in converting our country to an Islamic state…that is the religious mandate of the Qu’ran that all Muslims must adhere to.”""*

http://lionheartuk.blogspot.co.uk/2009/07/talksport-radio-interview.html

Ray made the unfortunate mistake of not checking the political affiliation of those helping him at the time  and the EDL was soon overrun by the far right and Ray was booted out from the very organisation he formed.

&gt;  In fact, Tommy Robinson is apparently in favour of multiculturalism and gay rights.

It still doesn't mean his actions aren't far right even if they are focused on a narrow and populist hate campaign against muslims.

&gt; It would take some real dedication for an MI5 agent to go to such lengths to set up a group that simply organises marches in town centres.

If they were looking to keep tabs on some of the more violent members of the far right those who would be willing to go on to the streets to fight the enemy then its a good way of understanding where any potential future threats are coming from. also the desire to create a strategy of tension, for the general public to get so fed up with their behaviour that they demand something be done and are willing to have their rights rolled back further.

&gt; So I'm not sure exactly what MI5 would be interested in, unless they wanted to track some of the skinheads who tag along with the EDL.

Two possible reasons, 1) to keep tabs on the far right 2) to create a state of tension of tension on the streets 

&gt; The real threats to this country come from Islamists, environmentalists, anarchists, communists and foreign agencies. MI5 don't have the time to be messing around with low risk groups like the EDL.

true,seannn,null,null,"&gt; The system we devised was designed to confuse the opposition. And it was economical. You want everyone to do their share. The important thing is that everyone can control the ball and do the basic things. It's control and pass, control and pass. If you delay, the opposition is all behind the ball. So you are looking for somebody who can control it instantly and give a forward pass. And that gives you more space.
&gt; 
&gt; You see some teams playing and it seems as nobody wants the ball. They turn their back on each other. But at Liverpool, there is always somebody to help you. That's why Kenny Dalglish was an instant success. He came to a club and he had choices. Kenny was the kind of player who could exploit that kind of thing to the full. 
&gt; 
&gt; So this is the secret. Get it. Give an early pass. Switch the ball around. You might not seem to be getting very far, but the opposition pattern is changing. And the space opens up for the final pass. All the players must understand that when they've delivered a pass, you've only just started. You have to back up and look to help somebody else.

It more or less happens again when he regenerates into the 6th Doctor, because the regeneration results in a Doctor who is - at least initially - violent and unstable.

Specifically, public lavatories that charge £1 for usage and empty the waste through a series of pipes that terminate at Margaret Thatcher's grave. You'd create a shedload of jobs in the construction of the Margaret Thatcher Memorial Toilets and the series of pipes on which they'd depend. The benefits aren't just short-term, either - such a system would require a fair bit of maintenance, providing long-term employment and the costs would be covered through the charge to use them.

Now, there is the minor problem that Thatcher lost power in 1990. Meaning that the people who had families and could see directly what her policies were doing are now in their fifties or older and I'm not sure there's a sufficient number who still feel strongly enough to pay £1 to piss on her on a regular basis.

Then, at the end of the month {or just before you next get paid}, see how much is left in your current account and transfer that across to the new high interest account. It doesn't have to be a lot, but it is money that you will not miss (because you haven't already spent it and new money is going in to replace it).

Do this for a few months to give you a good idea of how much you can realistically save each month and then set up an automatic transfer to the new savings account, moving that excess ""money that isn't missed"".

I've been sent between minors and majors departments because neither of them have the staff for another patient, let alone a bed, especially with 2 more ambulances in the queue, and another on its way. Nurses have greeted crews with a not-entirely-joking 'Why have you come here, can't you go somewhere else?'.

Try being the only receptionist, with ambulances to book in, regular walk in patients to sort out and all your other duties to conduct.

This has knock on effects to the care provided to the most ill patients as well. At first what shocked me, I have now lost count of the times I have brought a patient in on blue lights to see a single nurse waiting in resus, or no staff at all waiting to receive a critically ill patient

A lot of people *say* they have a budget, but usually what they mean is that they know they spend the money they have on stuff. They don't actually think about where it is its going in advance, and they just aren't going into debt too badly. Heck, I used to be one of those people.

At the start of this year I took a look at my finances. I'd been living comfortably, putting a little money aside each month (or so I thought) and certainly wasn't in debt. However I realised that my savings had pretty much stagnated over the past few years. What had been happening was I was saving a little money, but then dipping into it in order to fund a big expense.

A few months later I started reading up on /r/PersonalFinance, and I now use a [piece of software called YNAB](http://www.youneedabudget.com/) in order to manage my budget. If you're interested and want a discount on it PM me, I won't post it here because its an affiliate link and I don't want to be spammy. Basically you can do the same on a spreadsheet although YNAB simplifies the process. I won't go into detail about it here, but [read the method and see if it fits for you](http://www.youneedabudget.com/method), but as an example [this is how my finances have progressed since I started using it](http://i.imgur.com/H2NA1C5.jpg), and this includes an unexpected bill of £600 for my car at the start of this month. Before I would have been stressed about how to pay that off. This month, it just happened (with a bit of budget redistribution naturally).

I now have two main savings pots. One is long term savings, which never get dipped into. The other is a ""stupid stuff"" budget which is to enable me to go off on adventure holidays with my mates but still have enough money to put into savings, pay for Chrimbo, petrol etc. So I have guaranteed money going into my savings, enough money in my account for when annual expenses roll around, and visibility of when I'm overspending on something.

The only difference is you may keep hitting an arbitrary 'spending limit' which will prevent you from using the card until the balance is paid. In this case you ask for the limit to be raised, or pay the balance manually.

If you don't pay the full balance that's when the rest of terminology becomes relevant. The APR is how much interest you pay back. So lets say you got a card with 15% APR. If you failed to pay a balance of £1000 one month, you would be charged £12.50 (15% of an Annual Payment Rate from £1000, Divided by 12 months for a single month charge). Your balance would then be £1012.5. Keep doing this for each month you fail to clear the balance.

You may also have items such as minimum payment required, etc. Which is just the bare minimum you need to pay off a balance for a single month in order not to incur a missed payment fee. People which 'stooze' (pseudo-loans) using 0% APR cards are very aware of this amount.

You may have other items, such as payment protection insurance charges or identity protection fees but these are generally things you should opt not to purchase.

Having a credit card improves credit history. However the higher the credit limit of your card may also impact your ability to get further credit.

true,Swooshington,1953,,"&gt; Who are some of your favourite players and why? 

Of the current crop of Blues, my personal favorites are David Luiz and Juan Mata. Luiz, a Brazilian central defender, is a joy to watch. He always seems to be smiling and enjoying himself, and his ability and personality had endeared himself to the fans. Mata is one of the most technically gifted players to have graced the pitch at Stamford Bridge, and seems like an intelligent, genuinely likeable person off the pitch.

Historically speaking, the greatest player to have worn the Royal Blue of Chelsea is Gianfranco Zola. The diminutive Italian was an attacking player signed in 1996, who was everything a modern footballer should be. He was also voted the greatest player in our history during our centenary year. Go to YouTube and search him. There are countless compilations that demonstrate his skill and ability. Research him, you will not be disappointed.

&gt; Why does Chelsea get a lot of hate? 

I believe a lot of the hate aimed at Chelsea comes from two areas: Abramovic and the players. The purchase and influx of cash from Roman helped elevate us to New levels of success, which really did not sit well with many British football fans. Traditionally, football is a working class sport and as a result the working class ideals of success through hard work and such was the opposite of how we won our first title. As a result, we and the other ""oil"" clubs (clubs with New rich owners: see also Man City, PSG, Monaco etc) are in direct opposition to the traditional model for success, despite money and influx of cash always being part of the game. 

We also receive hatred because certain players (Ashley Cole and John Terry specifically) have quite negative media images. Whether this be indiscretions on the pitch or off, some players have ended up in situations where they have been accused of racism or cheating on their partners, to name just two examples, and are seen as negative role models. Truthfully, most of the stuff about JT is media nonsense and has all been proved to be fictitious, whereas Ashley is usually a bit of a dick. However, other fans believe what is written and hold it against the club, the players and the fans.

&gt; What are some inside jokes? 

The only one that comes to mind is calling the home ground of our rivals, Tottenham Hotspurs (White Heart Lane), Three Point Lane due to the consistent wins we have historically got there. 

&gt; And what are some great games I should watch and where could I watch them?

If you can watch the game between Chelsea and Liverpool in 2000 (I think) where Jesper Gronkjaers goal secured Champions League football and the purchase of the club by Roman, it's probably the most significant game in our history. Then most Champions League games from the knockout rounds are always good quality.

of water by the landlord. 

versus 

""the tenant is responsible for all utilities, e.g. gas, elec, water, sewage, telephone."" - 'responsible' is very ambiguious; does it mean you're just paying for the stuff that flows through the pipes, or are you responsible for looking after the pipes themselves etc. 

Because of this you'd have the doctrine of [Contra proferentem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_proferentem) on your side if the landlord wanted to challenge you openly. In addition, in a direct conflict between a clear term and an ambigious one courts will ALWAYS prefer the clear term. 

In addition to this the previous course of dealings with the other landlord can be relied upon to show what the ambiguity meant - i.e landlord pays, because the previous behaviour demonstrates the actual intentions of the contracting party.

Either you're expecting people with impossibly high levels of experience, or you're making all of this up.

I doubt he is. 

There is basically no reliable way to get good staff. It's a problem every employer faces.

Finding staff is easy. I could put an advert in my local paper tomorrow and by this time next week I'd have fifty or a hundred applications from all over the world, no problem.

The problem is that when you start sifting through those applications, the quality of them is appalling. Let's say for the sake of argument it's 100 applications - makes the maths easy:

 - 20 will write to ""Dear Sir or Madam"" despite the advert giving them a specific name to write to. At this point, they might as well write on the covering email ""I can't be bothered to properly read the advert I'm replying to"".
 - 8 will be so ludicrously overqualified that I'd be scared to hire them because as soon as the economy picks up, they'll be off like a shot. Which means I'll have to go through this whole process - this long, laborious, expensive, dear-God-I-can-think-of-a-hundred-things-I'd-rather-do process - again.
 - 5 will be so ludicrously underqualified that either they never read the advert in the first place or they have some sort of quota imposed on them by the Job Centre.
 - 40 will have heard all the advice about how your covering letter should be a couple of paragraphs and your CV no more than two pages. Problem is, it's difficult to condense everything important into that, so most people don't. They write a very bland, generic CV and cover letter that's supposed to be OK for any job. As a result, it will usually skim over lots of things rather than going into detail for a handful of things. Which is an absolute disaster because I'm likely to be looking for specific knowledge, not someone who has a rough understanding of 100 different things.
   - You might have really got into a particular module at university and you might want to specialise in it. It might be precisely the sort of thing I've advertised for. But if you've had the bright idea to keep your CV generic so as to appeal to the widest possible audience, I won't know.
 - 2 will have written in such terrible English that I'm honestly not sure they speak the language at all.
 - 10 will have written in pretty poor English. Oh, their meaning is clear enough, but communicating with them on a regular basis would be a constant struggle. 

Where are we up to now? 85?

 - 2 will be people from another country who found the local newspaper's website. Specifically, they'll be from a country where it'll be very difficult to sort out working visas. Now, there's nothing intrinsically wrong with hiring foreign staff, but like all employers, I want an easy life. I'm not interviewing someone that will need me to go through that process unless their application is so damn good I could have written it myself.
 - 4 will be from agencies who will want 20% of the applicant's salary as a fee if they get the job - despite the fact I explicitly said ""no agencies"" in the advert.
 - 9 will stand out well enough for me to interview. 


Of those 9:

 - 1 won't even bother to show up for the interview.
 - 1 will show up with tattoos and piercings, wearing a torn, faded Iron Maiden T-shirt for a customer-facing role. Where the customer in question is the board of directors at Lloyds Bank.
 - 1 will have so much difficulty holding down an intelligent conversation that I shall honestly wonder if they're hungover from the night before.
 - 2 will have a personality that would make me want to gouge my own eyes out sooner than work in the same room as them.
 - 2 will have such trouble answering basic questions based on what they claim to have done in their CV that I'm compelled to wonder if their entire CV is a work of fiction.
 - 1 I could probably just about get on with, though they're not the perfect candidate.
 - 2 I would gladly hire.",0,1378641430,null,0,false,0,cc43e7r,t3_1lwhp5,t1_cc43e7r,t1_cc3kxta,null,1429550006,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,hawkfeathers,null,null,"Sorry about the book I've written below.

I'm a post grad at St Andrews, but I'm also American and I've now been here for four years.  I did my undergraduate degree in the US, so hopefully I can give some contrast and perspective.

In terms of environment, St Andrews is a pretty inspiring place.  It's beautiful and historic, and there are plenty of beautiful walks and places to quietly sit all around the town.  Because it's small, you will see your friends constantly while out and about.  The farthest ends of town are a 25 minute walk (by my walking pace), so in general you're pretty much always in a position to meet up with people. (Although St Andrews does give a skewed perspective on ""far"". After a couple years, people begin to complain about how painfully far a 15-20 minute walk is.)

As a result of the smaller than typical student population, your professors and tutors will give you more time and attention.  Speaking from the perspective of a postgrad tutor (which you'll have teaching you in the form of tutors and demonstrators your first year), it's nice to actually get to know our students. You're rarely just a number here, unlike many other universities.

That said, St Andrews requires a particular temperament because it is so small.  There are only a handful of coffee shops.  You'll be hanging out in the same place every day.  The two best places for a cup of coffee will almost always be full.  The library is used as a social area because there aren't many others. Sometimes you'll want to go grocery shopping without running into all of your classmates, your tutor, and your friends - but that's next to impossible. 

From the American perspective, be prepared to meet lots of other Americans.  The first year of my PhD, the university owned house in which I lived had both someone from the area in which my parents live, and someone who went to my rival undergraduate university.  We'd not known each other before St Andrews, we met in the house coincidentally.  That sort of thing happens a lot.  That said, there are also lots of other nationalities, and you'll have an opportunity to exchange culturally like you've probably never had before. 

While there's not much in the way of shopping in St Andrews, Dundee is 25 mins away by bus, and Edinburgh is 60-90 mins by train, so you'll be able to get your fill of the world outside the bubble.  I had been to Scotland, but not to St Andrews, before I came here.  I was a bit surprised by just *how* small it is, but I still enjoyed myself.  I'd say it's probably worth visiting if you can, just to see how you like it. 

Also, the chemistry building has the cheapest vending machines in the university.  Small pleasures, right?

For me personally, I made some of the best friends I've ever had here and did an incredible amount of personal growth.  I've gotten to live in houses that were 400-450 years old and have intellectual debates (and wine) with someone of the best people in my field. All in all, I can't complain.

**TL/DR**: St Andrews is a uniquely close-knit, beautiful university with a distinct atmosphere.  It's not for everyone, but it can be deeply rewarding.  If you can endure the bubble, you'll make very close friends and get a more one-on-one education than most universities.

No, Bedder 6 had  the rights to marketing Top Gear outside of the UK. It did not 'own' it; this is a completely different thing.

There was another person, who also got £30 a week, who only did the absolute minimum, put in no effort at all, and got lowest grades possible without completely failing. 

On the other hand, I worked my socks off, got the highest possible marks right from the start, regularly had to wait two hours for the bus to go to/from college, was given £15 a month by my parents because that was all they could afford and was unable to get a job because I lived in a rural area with buses only coming every two hours.

Yes, but it's no longer played on shortwave radio, which means that's unnecessary.

Playing that only makes the messages easier to identify, which lends credibility the idea that it's a hoax.

If these genuinely are messages for spies, then MI5 shouldn't be including that jingle just from nostalgia.

&gt; even if other governments were constantly listening, they couldn't find out what the message was

""Even if""? I don't think you realise how easy this is.

The claims are that these messages are for secret agents in some foreign country - they're going to be calling from a mobile phone or a landline or from a payphone, and the calls are going to go through a central exchange, probably in the capital. 

If I had a million telephone calls records as .wav files on hard disk, I doubt that it would take me more than a few weeks to write a script which would scan them all and identify those containing the Lincolnshire Poacher jingle.

And I say this as a project in my weekends and evenings, writing a shell script or using Python or Perl and some common open source tools. It is trivially easy for a government to identify these calls - not to mention that any government *does* have the capability to record every phonecall in the first place.

You say they can't find out what the message is - did you read my original comment? I said that myself in the first place! However, this allows the hypothetical government to identify the phones used by the spies - hopefully it won't reveal their home or workplace phone, but it might reveal that the calls went through a cell tower in a particular area of the city, or it might allow a particular payphone to be watched.

This [bbc news article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4719222.stm) is the closest I can find, but there was one that directly attacked people 'wasting their time' doing something like philosophy which is why I chose it as an example.

I think the only advantage in the majority of sectors for a philosophy degree is that you have a degree. I'm sure you learned tons of life skills but no-one is going to care for the purposes of employment unless you're able to demonstrate in an interview that you're a good candidate, and to my knowledge, all degrees are going to teach you these life skills like communication, reasoning, teamwork etc. except some of them you're going to come out with engineering knowledge, understanding of chemistry, biology, etc. which are directly useful skills because you won't require as much training.

I'm sure people who passionately like philosophy do well in it and are creative, but I've yet to meet a single person that continued after university to study it in their own time. I don't think they view it as something they want to do for the rest of their life, I think they just view it as 3 fun years of university before then saying 'fun is over' and entering a completely separate real world.

The other issue is that it is supply and demand, but supply is dictated by profitability and demand by how much money people have, or in the case of care, the government has. There are tons of care workers out there working only a few hours a week and desperately wanting more structure and better hours, but they can't dictate anything because there are too many of them. This is actually a good thing for the tax payer, because the government will obviously pay for people to go into care that need it and cannot pay themselves, and the prices are lower because there is so much cheap labour from care workers. 

The problem is more that the government doesn't have the money to pay for the care workers, even though there are loads of them.

[George Osborne's Budget speech in full][1] (Telegraph)
[1]: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/budget/9942779/George-Osbornes-Budget-speech-in-full.html

&gt; Today, I'm going to level with people about the difficult economic circumstances we still face and the hard decisions required to deal with them. It is taking longer than anyone hoped, but we must hold to the right track. And by setting free the aspirations of the nation, we will get there. 

&gt; Building a modern reformed state we can afford. Bringing businesses to our shores with competitive taxes. Fixing the banks. Improving our schools, our skills, our infrastructure, and our industry. For years people have felt that the whole system was tilted against those who did the right thing: who worked, who saved, who aspired. These are the very people we must support if Britain is to have a prosperous future.

&gt; This is a Budget for those who aspire to own their own home; who aspire to get their first job; or start their own business; a Budget for those who want to save for their retirement and provide for their children. It is a Budget for our Aspiration Nation. 

&gt; The HM for Stoke on Trent Central has argued passionately and in a non-partisan way about the damage energy costs are doing to his city's famous ceramics industry - and he's persuaded me. So we will exempt from next year the industrial processes for that industry and some others from the Climate Change Levy. And in the Spending Round we will provide support for energy intensive industries beyond 2015. 

&gt; **I also want Britain to tap into new sources of low cost energy like shale gas. So I am introducing a generous new tax regime, including a shale gas field allowance, to promote early investment. And by the summer, new planning guidance will be available alongside specific proposals to allow local communities to benefit. Shale gas is part of the future. And we will make it happen.** 

**[2 July 2013]**  
[Will Boris Johnson drill for shale gas in London?][2] (Guardian)
[2]: http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jul/02/shale-gas-energy

&gt; **Nonetheless, a little-known and fairly anonymous company called Northdown Energy Limited has licenses to explore around the Croydon area. It's the only company to hold such licenses within the M25. While they were granted for conventional oil and gas exploration, current regulations mean these can be used for shale gas - if there's any there.**

&gt; **Maybe the Mayor's office knows something we and the British Geological Survey don't?**

&gt; Will Croydon get fracking before it gets the underground?

&gt; If the right geology is there and if planning permission can be obtained, and the public can be won around, there's technically no reason why frack pads couldn't pop up across London. After all, drilling near urban areas is already being done for conventional fuels. But those are three pretty big 'if's'.

&gt; **""I want Britain to be a leader of the shale gas revolution - because it has the potential to create thousands of jobs and keep energy bills low for millions of people,"" Mr Osborne said.**

&gt; **A new tax allowance will see a certain portion of income from each shale gas ""pad"" -- or production site - receive an effective tax rate of 30pc, rather than 62pc.**

&gt; The tax break is similar to those on offer to oil and gas explorers in technically-challenging and less economic fields in the North Sea, where they have been credited with revitalising interest. 

&gt; **Ministers have also promised guidance on planning rules for shale gas developments and to cut environmental permitting processes from 13 weeks to less than a fortnight.**

&gt; **Fracking firms say that planning permission and public support, rather than tax issues, are the biggest obstacles to exploration for shale gas in the UK.**

&gt; **In a blow for shale gas explorers and government alike, Water UK, which represents all major water suppliers, has published a series of concerns about fracking and warned that failure to address them could ""stop the industry in its tracks"".**

&gt; **Water UK, which is demanding an urgent meeting with shale companies to discuss its fears, warns: ""Shale gas fracking could lead to contamination of the water supply with methane gas and harmful chemicals if not carefully planned and carried out.""**

&gt; It suggests aquifers could be contaminated by fracking, by leaks from wells, or by poor handling of chemicals or waste water on the surface.

&gt; The group also warns that ""the fracking process requires huge amounts of water, which will inevitably put a strain on supplies in areas around extraction sites"".

&gt; It adds: ""The power of the drilling and fracturing process even risks damaging existing water pipes, which could lead to leaks and shortages to people's homes and businesses.""

&gt; Shale gas explorers insist that fracking is safe but fear their attempts to test Britain's shale potential will be hamstrung unless they can win public support.

&gt; Water UK says it is not ""taking sides"" over fracking but that water supplies must be protected ""at all costs"", with the utilities' own reputations on the line.

&gt; Shale gas firm Cuadrilla says it has ""robust safety measures in place"" to prevent water contamination. Incidents have been ""extremely rare"" in the US and caused by ""bad practice"".

&gt; **Councils no longer able to investigate issues such as seismic activity, venting and potential impact on ground water supplies**

&gt; Local communities are set to lose control over key environmental decisions affecting whether fracking can go ahead within their midst, it is claimed.

&gt; Campaigners opposing the industrial-scale exploitation of shale gas reserves in the British countryside said the Government has removed key democratic controls in its dash to bring unconventional energy resources on stream.

&gt; **Under planning guidelines published last week, councils will no longer be able to investigate issues such as seismic activity, flaring and venting as well as the potential impact on ground water supplies before granting planning permission for new wells.**

&gt; Instead the Department of Energy and Climate Change, the Environment Agency and the Health and Safety Executive will take responsibility for regulation.

&gt; It is claimed the new guidelines - which will not be consulted on - will remove local authorities' right to make decisions independent of central Government energy policy.

[Firm gets licence to explore Croydon for fracking sites][7] (thisiscroydon)
[7]: http://www.thisiscroydontoday.co.uk/Firm-gets-licence-explore-Croydon-fracking-sites/story-19604959-detail/story.html

&gt; **Controvertial gas extraction technique 'fracking' could be on its way to Croydon after a licence was granted to hunt for potential sites in the borough.**

&gt; **Little-known company Northdown Energy Limited has been given permission to explore Croydon for natural gas and oil. These licences, under current regulations, allow the licence-holder to investigate opportunities for shale gas extraction, or fracking, across a 400 sq km area, including Croydon.**

&gt; Fracking involves drilling down into the earth and directing a high-pressure water mixture at shale rock to release the gas inside. The process sparked controversy for its environmental impact as well as the potential to cause minor earthquakes.

&gt; Dominic Shepherd, who lives in Kenley and runs the annual Kenley Fun Day on the Common said he did not think the area was suitable for exploration.

&gt; He said: ""Croydon to me is over populated and there are too many people to too few open spaces.

&gt; ""If it was in the middle of the countryside miles from anywhere it would probably be ok.

&gt; **""But Croydon is very suburban - they are saying it is safe but if there was ever an issue, a lot of people living here near these open areas would suffer.**

&gt; ""We also don't have the open space to spare, however these companies pass it off.

&gt; **""We can't know what is happening underground, so what if something happens?**

&gt; ""I appreciate we have to make use of scarce resources, but at what cost?

&gt; Although undertaking the controversial drilling programme would involve Northdown Energy Limited having to seek a further licence, the current situation allows exploratory work to uncover reserves of shale gas that could be used in the future, subject to planning permission.

But, we have a big squad, and I'm sure the players will see every match as their opportunity to push for their own place in the starting line up.  A little competition could be good for the team.

&gt; We have to, as a group, have the expectation that this squad has the talent where a season in which we do not win a trophy is unacceptable. That's my belief, this group can't be considered a success without top four and a cup in the cabinet.

I think it's too early to expect much.  I honestly don't even have too high hopes for top 4.  I think it'll be a close run thing, but every team has strengthened significantly other than perhaps Man Utd, who even without Ferguson I honestly don't see dropping out of the top 4.  Liverpool and Man City have bought well, Chelsea has arguably the best squad in the whole league and a proven trophy-winning manager, and Arsenal, though seriously weakened by injuries, has pedigree and will look mighty dangerous once those injuries heal up.

Considering nearly every match we'll play will have 5-7 new starting players, I can't imagine we'll click immediately this season.  I think next season (injuries/form depending) we'll be well placed to challenge perhaps even for 3rd place.  I'm hoping for the best, but it may be too much expectation too soon for something now.

true,clynch2,lfc68,null,"Well... OP may be disagree with me, but I think another college football team strikes an uncanny resemblance to LiverpoolFC.  That would be my dear Cornhuskers from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in the heartland of America. Aesthetically we also wear Red and have an extremely knowledgeable and courteous fanbase (see: how the Kop applauds attractive team movement/skill by either side, the Husker fanbase will applaud opposing teams off the field even if we've just beaten us on our home field.)  Below are some more categorical comparisons to the teams.

Let's start with some similar stats:
LFC: 5 European Cups
NU: 5 National Championships (I know the last one stings /u/rgalzera 

One Manager/Coach winning a majority of those championships
LFC: Bob Paisley (77, 78, and 81)
NU: Tom Osborne (94, 95, and 97)

Attendance:
LFC: ~45,000 (Anfield)
NU: ~93,000 (We are the current holders of the NCAA consecutive home game sell-out streak. As of yesterday we sit at 325 games starting back in 1962.)

Stadium Statues:
LFC: Shanks
NU: Tom Osborne and Bob Devaney (&lt;-- NU's Shanks)

Pregame Rituals:
LFC: Players, managers, and staff alike are keen to touch the This Is Anfield sign before entering onto the pitch.
NU: Similar to the TIA sign, the Cornhuskers run out to the stadium, but not before touching the lucky Horseshoe

Youth System:
LFC: Melwood
Although I'm relatively new to English youth development history, it's always struck me that LFC has developed its own crops of talent bonding the community with the team when such players go on to succeed mightily with the first team.

NU: Walk-On Program
If you aren't familiar with college athletics in the states, most of the top athletes earn scholarships and are recruited directly to attend programs.  Tom Osborne started the walk-on program in 1973 as a way to increase his roster size after recent scholarship cuts. Thus started a legacy of homegrown farm kids born and raised in the shadow of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln could have an opportunity to walk on for free and earn a starting berth.  Literally hundreds of success stories since 1973, but the point is local kids who had a dream and trained hard enough could crack the team.

Fanbase culture:
I cannot truly compare what the Liverpool culture feels like as I have never crossed the Atlantic, however, I can identify with the burning desire of the fanbase to share and pass on *that* feeling you get when supporting the team.  In Nebraska, Cornhusker Football is literally the only show in the state.  We have no professional teams (i.e. NBA, MLB, NFL, or NHL) and being in the middle of the USA we get little respect as a state of interest for tourism.  No matter, these subtleties make it even more imperative that when people come to our state we turn up the hospitality levels to unfathomable generosities in an attempt to pass down any of the fervor we feel about our team.  It's almost like sports rabies.  We want you to feel the itch, the identity we live with daily as both successful, but slightly ostracized culture.  From my few years of supporting the team, Scouse culture seems to have many similarities.  

Down years/droughts/incompetent management:
While I would love to leave our similarities as the only link between these two teams, unfortunately our recent droughts of success are a little too familiar as well and only solidify these similarities.  

LFC: Hicks and Gillett.  Comolli.  Hogdson.  'nuff said.
NU: A man named Bill Callahan and former son of the state Steve Pederson would take NU Football from the lights and glamour of the 90's to the pits between 2003-2007, a period of time in which NU suffered it's first losing season in nearly forty years, first season without a bowl game in a similar time frame, and a movement away from a traditional program motto (run the ball, dominate defensively) to a pathetic football shell (throw the ball, get dominated defensively).  Thank the Lord, Tom Osborne replaced Steve Pederson as Atheltic Director and shortly thereafter fired Billy as Head Coach.

Welp there's my overly analytic comparison between Nebraska Football and Liverpool Football Club.  Thanks OP for the thread, I was really needing to get this all out.  YNWA!

I must admit however I'm not too much of a fan of this type of formation.  It often creates 3 very separate banks of players, with not enough penetration between the lines.  The danger is your wide men stay really wide to try to stretch play and create gaps, but then leave the CMs in the middle of the park with it all to do.  You either need three very mobile players rotating in the centre of the field, or three exceptionally good ball players/passers, like Barcelona have.  At the moment we've been playing three fairly similar players there, and none of them have the dexterity on the ball or the creative movement to really unlock things.  Eriksen will help hugely.

At the moment this formation hasn't worked in our favour this season, but it will improve in time as players get to know each other and get drilled in their movements.

To me the best version of this formation is to have two inverted wingers who can both cut inside, or stay wide.  Cutting inside allows other players to rotate wide, and also gives them the choice to either keep rotating passing inside the field, or to shoot on their stronger foot.  The trick is to make sure the CMs are moving all the time, so the centre of the pitch doesn't become too congested or play too one-dimensional through the middle.

It will be interesting to see how AVB tweaks his line up and tactics throughout the season to either make this work, or try something different.  He has a good squad to pick from now, so he potentially has even too much choice for how to set things up.

The process looks something like this:

 - You get what's called ""agreement in principle"" on a mortgage of £(however much you intend to borrow). A broker will help you here - if you walk into Halifax, they can only offer you a Halifax mortgage; they can't tell you if you'd get a better deal elsewhere. AIP is usually good for about three months.
   - Every time you ask a bank for agreement in principle, this will be noted on your credit report and banks can be twitchy about people who have applied for credit many times. A mortgage broker can search the market to find you a mortgage that they know you'll be accepted for, meaning you only have to apply once.
   - Agreement in principle is based on the money you want to borrow; if this amount changes, you need to go through the whole process again.
 - You speak to estate agents and spend a long time getting up close and personal with sites like rightmove. Be warned that estate agents aren't always terribly helpful - you may find that rightmove is considerably more helpful! Once you've found a property you like, you make an offer and, if it's accepted, the house comes off the market and you instruct a solicitor to deal with the purchase.
   - Don't expect to find the perfect house with nothing that needs doing to it. Don't worry too much about decoration - this can be changed quite easily and cheaply. Kitchens and bathrooms are rather more expensive, as is rewiring, new windows and a new boiler. Note that the law regarding where you can place a boiler has changed, so if you want to replace an old back boiler it'll need to go elsewhere in the house - bumping up your costs considerably.
   - Few of these issues are insurmountable, so if you've found a house that's perfect except for (say) the kitchen, knock £5,000 off your budget for the house and put this towards a new kitchen. 
 - You inform the bank you want to go ahead with the mortgage. They'll ask you some more questions, demand proof of income and take any application fees.
 - Your solicitor does whatever it is they do that costs £500, pays the vendor and you get the keys.

The whole lot from the day you find the house you want to the day you move in is usually about 10-12 weeks.",0,1378657409,null,0,false,0,cc46qgd,t3_1lz3ng,t1_cc46qgd,t3_1lz3ng,null,1429548447,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

Playing a 4-3-3 where 4 or 5 of your 6 non defenders are new is suicide and a blind dogmatic adherence to a philosophy that will bite us in the foot.

The 4-2-3-1 should be used for at least the first 60 minutes of the game until the players are there chemistry-wise. The switch from 4-2-3-1 to 4-3-3 is fairly easily to organize mid game. The reason we have looked ponderous at times under AVB is because, flat out, the formation is too sophisticated for our personnel and it requires a whole hell of a lot of footballing intelligence that only a few of our players have. The new players seem to be all pretty smart players, but it will take time. 

If we continue with the 4-3-3, expect weeks of the same slow moving easy to read static midfield we played at The Emirates while the players adjust to their zonal responsibilities and eachother. Also, Eriksen is not robust enough to play as a CM in the league. In Eredivisie, maybe, but in the premier league he will disappear for large parts of the game (which he honestly even did for Ajax), and I hope AVB sees that.

It's also more suitable in that formation for him to drop in between the CB's to form a back three when the fullbacks push right up the wings.

If you wanted you could approach one of their mortgage advisers before finding your ideal property to get some idea what level of offers they would accept.

**Rule 66**
&gt; be considerate of other road users..

**Rule 88**
&gt; ride in a dangerous, careless or inconsiderate manner

It's true that the highway code says nothing of *where* to ride in the road. However many people feel it *considerate* of other traffic to yield if it's particularly slow moving or obstructive and there's a large backlog of traffic behind it (this could apply to tractors, slow lorries, caravans, horse riders etc.). It's not obligatory, but it *is* polite and recognises there are other road users who can and probably do want to pass you. 

Unless you can ride at the speed of other traffic on a road, you ought to consider that there will be faster traffic that will want to pass you. By cycling in the centre of the road and making this much more difficult, you only exasperate the situation and force more extreme passing measures for anyone wanting to pass you - or pissing off others who just can't and causing traffic congestion. 

That is *not* a right - that is acting like an asshole. 

Drop the entitlement, ride safely but consider the road is no more there solely for your use than anyone else's. ",0,1378659435,null,0,false,0,cc47do9,t3_1lyrku,t1_cc47do9,t1_cc44523,null,1429548146,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

In principle a private bill can be introduced into either the commons or lords and progresses as any other bill. This National Service Bill was introduced into the commons and had its first reading (which is just a formality and doesn't imply any sort of consent from the house, in practice). The bill now awaits its second reading, where the principle of the bill would be debated more properly, followed by a vote on whether to progress it to committee stage. After committee comes report stage, then third reading. If the (commons) bill passes all of those stages, then it goes through all of the same stages in the Lords and, after changes from both houses are reconciled, goes to the Queen for Royal Assent.

If the Private Member's Bill passes both houses, it becomes law. The National Service Bill is currently stalled in the House of Commons awaiting its second reading (at which it would almost certainly be thrown out since it has no support).

Edit: You can see the journey ahead for this bill here: http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2013-14/nationalservice.html . It can be shot down at 2nd and 3rd readings in HoC and similar in HoL.

true,mr-mistoffelees,cnty-wales,Wales,"In relation to mortgage types: Fixed and variable, it's worth considering different scenarios. With fixed, you know what you're paying each month for 3 years, or however long the term is. The downside of these is that they're typically not as competitive as a variable. For instance, it may be that there's a variable rate which is 2% over the base rate for 3 years, so that'd be 2.5% at the moment. Similarly, a fixed rate of 5% for three years. Now, at the moment, the fixed looks pretty poor value for money. But, what happens if the Bank of England put the base rate up to 7%? Now which is better? 

The good thing is, the Mark Carney [has forecast that it'll take three years](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23968862) before the Base Rate gets off the 0.5% mark, so you can use this as a base for how things might perform in the medium term. 

It's also worth popping all of your figures into a spreadsheet to work out the total cost over the term, including the setup/arrangement fees, and any overpayment fees (if applicable).

IMO the admin isn't worth it. I mean, I assume your response to the previous question is that, *no, drunk people shouldn't be charged for emergency services if they're the victim of a crime.* So charge people £100 and they'll start filing false police reports to prove it wasn't their fault (and you'll have to prosecute them for it).

Start charging them £1000 or £10,000 and not only will you end up chasing them with debt collectors for life but you're going to have to institute an appeals process for people to say ""it's not my fault"". Will the presumption be of guilt or innocence? 

This seems like a great idea because you're visualising some pissed up wanker, being a public troublemaker.

Ignoring the fact that half the population has probably made idiots of themselves, drunk in public, at some time or another, this will suddenly seem a much less reasonable idea when some middle-class voter knocks over the  cafetière towards the end of a dinner party and burns himself or needs a couple of stitches in his thumb. He's had 2 or 3 glasses of wine, so he should be charged, too - it's obvious that the alcohol affected his coordination. 

Everyone makes mistakes, and a charge on healthcare will affect the poor disproportionately - an MP might be pissed off if he's charged £100 by A&amp;E, but it's not going break the bank. It's the price of posh sunday lunch to someone on an MP's salary - for a single mother, enjoying a drink on the rare weekend the ex is taking the kids, this is far greater punishment.

The way I see it (I'll probably get slated, but there you are.) I'd rather have a well educated person who was educated at Eton and then Oxbridge running for a political position than some scrote from a failing state school with no education past what is compulsory. 

That's a very simplistic view of the matter, obviously.

I certainly don't think they should ever be abolished, If I could afford to send my fictional children to a private school or even a public school like Eton or Harrow, I would.
I don't think there is much of an argument in saying schools like Eton or Harrow provide a far better education than the average state school. I'd probably go as far as saying the average private school provides a better education than the average state school.

Obviously there are poor private/public schools and brilliant state schools, but as a general rule I think it stands.

He's a serial killer who scalps his victims and who has severe mummy issues, loves mannequins/sometimes thinks he is one.

It's really gruesome and excellently shot, and, for a horror, is not at all cheesy.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","You present a pretty one-sided point of view for someone who doesn't ride... curiously, I do have a bike and cycle daily (more or less).  

Perhaps we've seen wildly different cyclists and it has warped our world views. Me? I've seen cyclists dart dangerously between traffic, run red lights (at junctions and pedestrian crossings), tailgate other traffic, cycle on pavements at speed between pedestrians... 

In short, lots of bad habbits that place themselves and others at risk. 

In fairness you're right - I've been passed by recklessly close traffic and only a week ago had to do an emergency stop for some woman who decided to pass me then turn right in-front of me down a side road. 

What would really be best though, what some countries in Europe get right where the UK goes wrong, is *truly* equally sharing the road. Sharing the road doesn't just mean ""cars are considerate of bikes"" or ""bikes are considerate of cars"" but that *everyone* is equally considerate. 

That's what I don't see about /user/rice5259 's down-votes. He or she is putting forth a very accurate and pragmatic statement: If you insist on cycling in the centre of a road, preventing traffic from passing - you *will* experience road rage sooner or later. Cyclists (for the most part) are slower than other road traffic and whilst they're just as entitled to use the road and just as deserving of being able to do so safely, that should *not* mean carte blanche to slow all other traffic to whatever speed they can cycle at and prevent any traffic from passing. That is - very simply - quite selfish. ",0,1378668210,null,0,false,0,cc4aljy,t3_1lyrku,t1_cc4aljy,t1_cc4afjs,null,1429546574,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

For me, Ivan comes on once we need to lock down, so he would replace Azpi, and possibly bringing on Mikel or another CB and changing to a 5 at the back would be ideal if we need to defend more, or if you wish, bring him on as a CB, and push Luiz to CDM.

I love Oscar, so if you really want him on at the start, you could possibly take off Willian, move Hazard across, and bring on Oscar.

But, I'd love to see that team start once, just to see if it would work, and I think it would, I find Hazard and Mata are dangerous in a more central position compared to the wide positions, and for speed, you can rely on Willian and Schurrle.

If Eto fails, you could bring in Torres or Ba, or being more creative, you could push Schurrle to ST, take off Eto, push Mata out wide, and bring on Oscar. 

For me, Oscar is the super sub in a 4141, and it's why I didn't start him in the starting 11, because I think he could be dangerous as a half time sub when teams are slightly tired, and he's full of energy.

(But if you really have to use Mazacar, then take off who you wish), but I'd rather start these players, and change at half time if it isn't working.",0,1378669515,null,0,1378670309,0,cc4b3ii,t3_1lxhd6,t1_cc4b3ii,t3_1lxhd6,null,1429546340,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Like right now, I think he would be better off saving hard for a house deposit rather than putting lots of money into a pension. That is if you consider the mortgage payment is likely cheaper than rent, the fact he is slowly buying equity rather than renting, and that the house may increase in value.

I didn't get an independent mortgage advisor and decided to go with a fixed rate for as long as possible (5 years) as the base rate is so low right now. 

I went onto my banks mortgage calculator online which showed me what I could afford based on various deposit amounts. 

Then I went into my bank and had a sit down and discussed my income, what I hoped to borrow and spend and the best way of balancing that with a deposit. I got a letter with an agreed amount in principle. 

Then I put an offer on a house. 

Then I had to go back to my house and apply for the mortgage. 

In the mean time I got quotes from solicitors and instructed one. 

Protip: Get their quote in writing.. 

My mortgage was approved in a week and a half. About half the time I was told. I also paid for a survey on the property which took a couple of days. 
My solicitor has asked for £450 +VAT for his rate,  my survey was £430 with a valuation, land registry fee is £175, my mortgage companies legal fees are £140, there's a £75 purchase fee or something.. 

I'm currently still waiting for the seller to hand over all of the paperwork that should have arrived with the contract. Scary times as they had said they were in a hurry and now they're stalling.. 

From what I gather, buying an old property, that is one not covered by these new schemes, you would need at least 10pc deposit. With the funds that can obviously match the rest. Come January 1st the first time buy scheme changes to all property I believe. The rates on those loans are a bit crap though but you may be able to get in on a 5pc deposit.

true,michaelisnotginger,cnty-scotland,"Scottish-Italian, will deep fry your pizza","OK background, I went to a public school in Edinburgh with silly blazers and ridiculous traditions for 8 years on a bursary

The school was very very good at promoting academic excellence. Because I had got in on an academic award, all the teachers gave me lots of advice and pushed me in their subjects, and the same went for the others in the same situation. However some teachers weren't as good for the reason that often teachers are hired not because they are good at teaching but because they will do the myriad of extra-curric activities necessary at such a place. I did a lot of music and sport and there were excellent facilities, a wide social outreach program. It does give you a huge advantage when you have 2 hours a day compulsory homework time, you stay at school from 8am-9pm (it was 90% boarders, 10% day pupils, and most of the day pupils stayed till 9 3x a week minimum) and Saturday school too - you are getting a huge leg up on people who go to school 9-3 5x a week and don't have the sporting or music facilities. Is it wrong that this is available? I'm not sure.

The reason is the school expanded greatly when I was there but in the 80s it had dropped to nearly just under 200 pupils. It was 600 when I left. Apparently it had undergone peaks and troughs before, generally along with the times that people didn't trust the British state education system. That's why there was a partial transition to the IB and iGCSEs (though most still did A-levels) and you did have a lot of people there whose parents never went on holiday and had taken out 2nd mortgages to put their friends through, either for the academic or alumni links. There was also a growing international element, mainly Hong Kong/Chinese but also Russian (though tons of these got expelled), Germans, Romanians, and American/Canadian as well. 

The problem was that many of the pupils there were complete cuntnuggets. There were 120 in my year and I'd be happy if I never spoke to many of them again. Partly because of me but partly because it's a complete shark tank atmosphere in the boarding houses and the 6th form boarding house where you are put in an immensely complicated social hierarchy that is forever set in stone unless you a) suddenly get good at rugby b) grow a big pair of tits c) come into a lot of money. I didn't realise till 6th form how much your parent's money could affect your friendship group and the hangers on round people that would form. If you were in the Courcheval ski group, the Gullen second home, and the Dubai Easter break you were set. As well as a lot of smart people (and there were many) there was also a massive culture of indolence round the richest who will never have any problems in their life - a worry about being too 'keen'. What's the point of spunking £150,000 over 5 years on your education if you get 3Cs and drop out of uni in the first year. I don't understand it but through friend links many of them will never have to work hard again.

So I greatly benefitted. I had opportunities that elsewhere I could not possibly have had. If I ever earn a decent amount I will try and put some money back in the bursary fund I so benefitted from. I met some great educators that I still keep in contact with to this day who made me want to study English and Classics every minute of the day. But the corrosive, toxic atmosphere of the place, mainly set by the pupils, despit ehte best intentions of the teachers, warps people's heads, especially from what I saw, young girls. If I ever have daughters, they are going nowhere near a public school.",0,1378673024,null,0,false,0,cc4cf4m,t3_1lz8il,t1_cc4cf4m,t3_1lz8il,null,1429545724,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18

I disagree, talent being rare only explains why some players get paid much more than other players. I don't argue with that, but it doesn't explain why football salaries are so high compared to any other profession that has a similar dynamic regarding scarceness of talent (tiddly winks was a deliberately silly analogy but it works if one is willing to think about it).

Thus my explanation covers the actual revenue stream which is totally dependent on exclusive broadcast rights, which in turn is totally dependent on the market distortion that is copyright. Take away copyright and you disable the power of the first broadcast because any one can re-stream thus diluting exclusivity, lucrativeness, and revenue.

Soren Malling has some great understated acting  as the ceo owning the ship  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyMegiVnYwM


 - World war z- ' aka brad pitt escapes from one zombie situation after another'.. Its ok. Probably better than star trek but really not great.  I hadn't read the book but my gf has and it seems like the film could have been a ton better had they stuck to the source material with a bunch of short stories about the zombie apocalypse, rather than 'hollywood actor x saves the world'.  Still worth a watch.


 - The place beyond the pines - loved it, amazing opening shot, great acting by the two leads and refreshing narrative that isn't the usual 'protagonist overcomes x to achieve y'. Really impressed by this one, I'd avoid the trailer and dive in. 

 - Children of men - watched this again after seeing the gravity trailer and getting over excited, cannot fucking wait for that film.  Not quite as great as i remembered but the car chase scene and end shot in which the camera doesn't cut are amazing.

true,veritanuda,null,null,"&gt; Or have I misunderstood some small part of the science?

Yes.. I am afraid you have.. 

Molten salts need to be @300-460^^C degrees  to melt.. so as soon as they hit air they freeze solid instantly plugging the leak. Furthermore there is no 'meltdown' to melt down as the fuel is already melted. 

A meltdown in a traditional LWR refers to when the solid fuel pellets melt and their carefully calibrated radioactive release goes tits up. This usually happens because of a coolant failure that means the fuel rods cannot be cooled. In addition to this risk of overheating, the coolant water @ 150-300 atmospheres when released through a leak will instantly turn to steam, where heat from the fuel and radiation can make the water split into hydrogen and oxygen. One spark and BANG, you get what happened at Fukushima, which had multiple failures in the coolant pumps (because of the Tsunami) and even though the reactor was shut down the latent heat and radioactivity caused the cores to overheat. 

LFTRs cannot suffer this problem, ever. First because the fuel is already melted. Second because they work at normal atmospheric pressure, so no nasty explosions. And thirdly, as I explained above, their use of molten salts means that were for any reason power removed from the coolant system the latent heat in the salts would melt a pre configured 'salt plug',  which is made by blowing cool air over an area of the pipe,  and the reactive coolant can be drained away under natural gravity into a passively configure cooling tank. 

This configuration of an atmospheric reactor also means the building can be much smaller, much cheaper to build and can be placed anywhere. They do not need large bodies of water close by as current reactors do and so can be placed closer to where they are needed.

For more science please look at the [Energy from Thorium](http://energyfromthorium.com/thorium/) website and feel free to ask questions and dig as deep as you like. The science does not disappoint and the engineering is exceptionally elegant. If you have either a physics background or an engineering one it will appeal to you on many levels.

Football is the way it is now because there is a demand for it. People want to watch football on television.

But even if it was only half that's still a taking of £2.15bn per year, with the rights costing sky about £2.35bn over 3 years.

It isn't some massive scheme which is somehow skewed out of proportion, it's a huge profit making industry which distributes about 65% of all revenue back into the players hands. Why? Because they are the entertainment, they're the reason people watched.

What I can actually see happening far too easily if we imagine a scenario to be how you say it ought to be is this: 

Lots and lots of cyclists in the middle of the road doing 10mph (because not all cyclists are fast ones) being hit by cars coming around bends at 30mph because the road they're on allows them to do so. The cyclist - their eyes being up front and not behind - may not notice the incoming vehicle in time or be able to manoeuvre in time. The car may not be able to stop or swerve. Regardless they will *not* be anticipating a slow moving cyclist in the middle of their path (and implying that they ought to would create the twitchy-est, most impractical driving style on the planet).

Both the cyclist and driver could be as considerate as they like and as careful as they like - but if you're moving significantly slower than other road vehicles and are occupying the middle of the road, you are a hazard. As a cyclist, you're a harder-to-see hazard. 

Little wonder then that - back in the real world - the grand majority of cyclists I've ever seen ride to the left by default because they are at least trying to be considerate and allow the majority of traffic (there are usually more cars on a road than bicycles, after all) to pass. 

It's not about bullying you into a corner or ""winning"", it's about sharing the road. By demanding that you be allowed the centre of the road and to travel at the comparatively slow speeds that bikes often do - you take the same niche as drivers who aggressively overtake or pass too closely to cyclists: both unwilling to share or consider others because they feel only *they* matter.",0,1378674177,null,0,false,0,cc4ctqp,t3_1lyrku,t1_cc4ctqp,t1_cc4cjaq,null,1429545534,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

This is just cynical speculation on your part. Football was televised long before Murdoch was on the scene*, as early as 1940s. Let's remember where the large sums of money go these days: players wages, grand stadia, shareholder dividends. It would still exist but at an appropriate size, on the pitch and televised.

&gt; Wages are only obscene if you only think about comparing them to what they used to be or if you compare them with other professions. Unfortunately that's a pointless exercise. The market decides what is a fair price, what is a fair salary.

Wages are obscene if one has even an ounce of humanity. You are a fool then if you think ""the market"" decides anything. They need state intervention to create and enforce intellectual property rights, thus IP is a market distortion. There is no natural law giving exclusivity to an idea.

&gt; I still don't understand, however, if you're actually advocating the removal of copyright or if you're just hypothesising over what would happen. If copyright was rescinded then of course the entire football world would implode, but why would you do that, what benefit does that bring to anything or anyone?

For this debate I didn't need to advocate reversing the privatisation of the intellectual commons, but yes, any sane democrat would be against copyright/patents. If football did implode I wouldn't care, but I don't see that happening. Of course the cancer would shrink to appropriate size.

I manage it fine. Why can't others?
Or are you looking to excuse those who can't be bothered looking out for others because ""in the real world"" that's not what car drivers do?

And if that's the case... They shouldn't be on the road.



&gt;What I can actually see happening far too easily if we imagine a scenario to be how you say it ought to be is this:
Lots and lots of cyclists in the middle of the road doing 10mph (because not all cyclists are fast ones) being hit by cars coming around bends at 30mph because the road they're on allows them to do so. The cyclist - their eyes being up front and not behind - may not notice the incoming vehicle in time or be able to manoeuvre in time. The car may not be able to stop or swerve. Regardless they will not be anticipating a slow moving cyclist in the middle of their path (and implying that they ought to would create the twitchy-est, most impractical driving style on the planet).
Both the cyclist and driver could be as considerate as they like and as careful as they like - but if you're moving significantly slower than other road vehicles and are occupying the middle of the road, you are a hazard. As a cyclist, you're a harder-to-see hazard.
Little wonder then that - back in the real world - the grand majority of cyclists I've ever seen ride to the left by default because they are at least trying to be considerate and allow the majority of traffic (there are usually more cars on a road than bicycles, after all) to pass.
It's not about bullying you into a corner or ""winning"", it's about sharing the road. By demanding that you be allowed the centre of the road and to travel at the comparatively slow speeds that bikes often do - you take the same niche as drivers who aggressively overtake or pass too closely to cyclists: both unwilling to share or consider others because they feel only they matter.




Cyclists who follow the Highway Code for their safety in a public space thats there for all not just car drivers are putting themselves in danger because either car drivers are too impatient (ergo should they have a licence?), or they are to set in their ways to drive in a safe manner,  or their journey is more important than theirs (no its not).

If you wish to compare those with cyclists who want to stay alive you go right ahead. I doubt anything I could say would change your mind.

Quite the contrary: In the real world, accidents happen. You presume that every driver is a homicidal maniac in the making the minute they sit behind the wheel of a car when - really - most want to get from A to B with a minimum of fuss: just like cyclists! 

I would argue that if cyclists can't allow for other road traffic, they shouldn't be on the road. Unfortunately we don't license people to cycle, nor are they registered, which means a certain breed of cyclist can behave as they like with relative impunity. 

&gt; Cyclists who follow the Highway Code for their safety in a public space thats there for all not just car drivers are putting themselves in danger because either car drivers are too impatient... 

No. Stop. Read what I said again. My point is that roads are for use by both cyclists *and* drivers. Not one, nor the other, alone.

If you wish to be accurate - sure there is more of a chance of hitting anything if its around a corner apposed to a straight open road.

But I'm not convinced hugging the side would help..

Obviously all roads are different - but around this way (norfolk) we have many bendy roads...so many in fact it's impossible to travel any distance on bike without using them. The problem we have is most of them are not wide a. If I was to hug the edge a car traveling at speed would hit me regardless of my position.


In the above situation I think being out of the edge would atleast give the diver additional time to see me. Now if that helps (I'm now technically a larger target) I don't know. But I do believe on most roads wound this way me being at the edge would make zero difference and the roads are so narrow.

Let's remember where the large sums of money go these days: players wages, grand stadia, shareholder dividends. It would still exist but at an appropriate size, on the pitch and televised.

It's not cynical speculation. Before the Sky breakaway there was a fraction of the amount of football on our screens than there is now.

And as for the last comment, ""an appropriate size"". Who are you to dictate what size is appropriate? Clearly it is the will of the consumer and if there was too much, then there would be a disparity. But there isn't, there is a demand for it and that's why it exists. If it didn't Sky wouldn't commit so many resources towards it.

Some aspects of IP and copyright law are wrong. But the total abolition of it is stupid. I don't want to be so curt, but it really is. I'm a writer and when I finish my work and have it published do you think it's fair if someone just takes that work and republishes it for the own financial gain? Do you do anything creative? How would you feel if someone just took a product you made and just copied it, without you receiving any benefit?

It seems to be, most of the time, when I encounter people who are against copyright they seem to live in a bubble where they think it's all or nothing. Yes copyright is abused by some people, but not all people. Just because a pharmaceutical company abuses their monopoly on a drug, because they own the patent to it, it doesn't mean that should affect the right of a broadcaster to wholly own the the product they're outputting.

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"&gt;Quite the contrary: In the real world, accidents happen. You presume that every driver is a homicidal maniac in the making the minute 

Not at all. I only ask that drivers do what the Highway Code requires of them. 

As for accidents - speeding/not overtaking/getting angry at another road user - that could all result In an injury or death is not an accident. 

&gt;they sit behind the wheel of a car when - really - most want to get from A to B with a minimum of fuss: just like cyclists!

You're opinion is someone's requirement to get from A-B with the minimum of fuss trumps someone's safety. It doesn't, and that's the basis of my argument.

&gt;I would argue that if cyclists can't allow for other road traffic, they shouldn't be on the road.

You forget that cyclists are there by right, unlike drivers who have to prove though training that they are adult enough to use there vehicle on the road.

 &gt;Unfortunately we don't license people to cycle, nor are they registered, which means a certain breed of cyclist can behave as they like with relative impunity.

Going on a tangent - there are a whole bunch of points here....

If you believe everything you write. Licensing cyclists would be the worst thing ever. Imagine a training scheme for cyclists that actively encouraged cycling in the middle of the lane :) 

Also....80% of cyclists hold a driving license. If you believe their actions are incorrect/careless/or law breaking, an additional license would do no more to change this

Impunity - registration for cars is only there for 2 reasons. 1: the cost of cars is so great that a registration making is needed. 2:due to the danger cars pose registration is also required for easy identification that can lead to their owners..

Given that bikes are cheap and cause 0-2 deaths per year the need for registration is simply not needed.

And overall have the same amount of impunity as a pedestrian.



&gt;Cyclists who follow the Highway Code for their safety in a public space thats there for all not just car drivers are putting themselves in danger because either car drivers are too impatient...

And that's not a cycling issue then is it. It's a driver issue.

Either because they are entitled or ignorant.


&gt;By cycling in the centre of the road you open yourself up to more accidents because you're more readily in the path that a car will take, and a more extreme manoeuvre will be necessary to either stop or pass you.

Or...by cycling in the middle of the lane you place yourself in full view of cars, you avoid rubble and drains.

As for taking the lane in general...I don't know any cyclists who don't do it for very good reasons. All other times, when roads are wide, when door zones are not a problem, when not in built up pedestrian areas they stay to the left.

&gt;Why can't you be?

As iv said - because safety trumps other people's convenience.

&gt; I'm a writer and when I finish my work and have it published do you think it's fair if someone just takes that work and republishes it for the own financial gain?

Who are you to ring fence a portion of the English language, something forged over millennia and calling it your own?

&gt; Do you do anything creative? How would you feel if someone just took a product you made and just copied it, without you receiving any benefit?

I'm not a selfish cunt. I code, I write music. I would rather have the odd person unduly gaining from my work than run the risk of Monsanto patenting my genes. Culture has always be shared, that's who it works. Ask Marlowe and Faust.

&gt; It seems to be, most of the time, when I encounter people who are against copyright they seem to live in a bubble where they think it's all or nothing.

If you have to apply a law and define so many edge cases then you really have to think about how just that law is in the first place. It is all or nothing: you can either privatise an idea or you can't, there are restrictions on the set of possible freedoms ore there isn't.

&gt; wholly own the the product

Part of ""their product"" is ""ownership"" of the electromagnetic spectrum.

&gt; I just hope, for your sake, you never have a good idea because you'll see how those law protect you when it comes to executing on that idea.

But Arsenal- one of our direct competitors and he was more than happy to pack up his stuff and leave Anfield for the Emirates.  Fuck Suarez.

The scenario described in the case referenced (travelling 1/2 to 2/3rds of the way into the oncoming lane to pass stationary traffic) is so far removed from the definition of filtering I was familiar with, that I did not believe it could be used to set a precedent for filtering speeds.  Especially as there was no reference to filtering made in the judgement.

Now, if filtering is defined to be an overtaking maneuver that you couldn't make safely/sensibly with a car, then I agree with your position.

-----

For reference I previously understood filtering to be moving between and alongside traffic travelling in the same direction as you, without (or only slightly) entering into the oncoming lanes.
