It will become an increasing problem until people stop feeding them.

My fianceés family are cattle farmers, one of the most highly respected in Denmark and internationally recognised. The foxes kill the farm cats (including a lot of kittens) that kill the mice and rats, they pick fights with the dogs (big dogs) and when they had chickens, the foxes would constantly and successfully try to grab as many as possible.

Frankly, unless they have been successfully domesticated like those ones in Russia, they are nothing more than a pest. I'm not advocating the utter inhumane toffery that is fox hunting, but you can't just automatically associate wanting to deal with a legitimate pest with such things. Some kind of cull probably isn't the right way, but we need some way of getting it into peoples heads that they aren't just fluffy and cuddly and we should let them roam around our gardens freely.

Only the interest portion grows if rates go up, but has to be met each month or you are repossessed. I/O is more attractive in high inflation environment because you defer repayment of the capital.

You seem to be looking to construct a scenario in which mortgage debt is not eroded for people in 1970s / 80s. What you have come up with so far in this thread does not apply as:

1. Rates went up then went down again - they did not stay high

I'll give you two personal examples. I personally have had problems with tight muscles in my legs for years, all the way through secondary school; eventually I developed an achilles tendon problem, which went on for about three years, so that I couldn't walk for more than about 10 minutes at a time. The NHS's attitude was essentially 'you're young, you'll be fine', and eventually, with private physiotherapy, I've just about recovered from the achilles problem, but the period of inactivity (one of the risk factors on this report) has lead to chronic health problems from which I don't think I'll ever fully recover. It's pretty clear now, that the NHS (at least in my area) simply does not provide a full physiotherapy service, because of the cost, similar to the situation with dentistry.

Likewise, my brother had chronic pains in his neck, he was given the same rhetoric from various GPs, including being accused outright of hypochondria. After two years, during which he dropped out from university, the family paid for a private scan, which showed a pre-cancerous growth in his neck. After surgery, he has physically recovered, and he has just about managed to put his life back together. But two years of enormous family arguments, and the mental consequences of having that medical problem for so long without acknowledgement, will certainly have long-term consequences on his health, and psychosocial effects on the family. My brother now lives in another country, and has never been back home.

The major way in which the NHS handles preventative care at present is through the [Quality and Outcomes Framework](http://www.nursingtimes.net/nursing-practice/clinical-zones/management/gp-bonus-scheme-not-tackling-health-disparity/5029015.article), where GP practices (which are mostly private businesses) receive cash bonuses for various procedures, such as persuading patients over 50 to take a cholesterol test. Other than that, the NHS is mostly a service for treating life-threatening illnesses, not for preventative care, and maintaining good health. That was reasonable back when we paid less than any other developed country for healthcare, but the Blair government increased the NHS's budget 80% in real terms. Now we have a European level of expenditure, but not a European level of care. I don't know whether the Tories' reforms are the answer, but reforms of some sort are clearly necessary.

And the reason they have so many people that are lactose/glucose/whatever intolerant is because of the sheer amount of corn syrup they consume because corn syrup is in EVERYTHING.

It's because their corn industry is massive and it can be used to bulk out poor quality foods. 

&gt;Ohio farmers alone, produced 546 million bushels of corn in 2009.

&gt;Corn oil is extracted from the germ of the kernel using a hexane solvent. Hexane is categorized by the EPA as a toxic chemical and hazardous air pollutant. More power to cold pressed oils.


&gt;Corn meal can be used to treat athletes foot, prevent aphids, kill ants and control weeds.


&gt;Corn can be disguised under these names; fructose, maltodextrin, cellulose, dextrin, dextrose and many more. All are highly processed, typically with a load of chemicals.


&gt;Almost all seed corn is now genetically engineered. It is not known for sure what the negative impact is, but on the positive side, it makes corn less vulnerable to pests and disease resulting in a reduction in the amount of pesticides, water and fungicides needed to grow.

&gt;More and more people are developing allergies to corn due to the overuse of corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup and corn products in our foods. It is cheap to produce and therefore widely used.


&gt;Foods containing corn that you may not think of and will not be listed as corn; Peanut butter (thickener), pizza crust, grated cheese (called cellulose, keeps the shreds from sticking together), baking powder, vanilla extract, distilled white vinegar, powdered sugar (keeps it from compacting), hotdogs, sausages and pancake syrup.

&gt;Also found in these products, to name just a few; body powder, vitamins, lotions, toothpaste, many medicines and ointments and in the adhesive in stickers, stamps and envelopes.


&gt;It is a staple in the feed for beef and pork production. So if you are allergic and ever get a headache from a steak.....

For this they are paid, and when they leave they would have had training, experience, and money to continue legally working on the outside - rather than having no skills, no experience, no money, and resorting to crime.

The ""cheaper"" aspect would be that, if a scheme such as this lowered the re-offending rate, so that the person involved did not go back to prison later in their life (after they are released the first time) then you don't need to ""pay"" for their second term; i.e. if...

The point is that while our laws are changing you are still vastly better off if you are a white male, to counter that we some time use laws that actively discriminate against white males in an attempt to be more fair.

So you are right, it is discrimination, it say so in the name we use to talk about it but that discrimination is indented as a off set to advantage that being white still gives you in the first place. Which is why people are not up in arms over this but would be if the place was talking about wanting more applications from white people.

The Kingdom of Great Britain resulted from the political union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland with the Acts of Union 1707 on 1 May 1707 under Queen Anne.

In 1801, under a new Act of Union, this kingdom merged with the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

After the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921) most of Ireland seceded from the Union, which then became known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.",0,1362499630,null,0,false,0,c8q60le,t3_19nnxc,t1_c8q60le,t1_c8prkxe,null,1431489859,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

When the 'National Assistance Act 1948' was passed, the life expectancy for Men was 66, and Women was 71. It is hard to fine an 'age' - similar to the retirement age we have now - but in the 'Old-Age Pensions Act 1908' this age was set at 70, when the Life Expectancy was around 50.

The current life expectancy is around 77.38 for Men, and 81.68 for Women. The idea that you can work until you're 65, and return on nearly 15 years worth of pension (of average) is unsustainable and impossible to action.

true,Guyag,hongkong,London,"&gt;The problem with asking parents to teach life skills is that they don't do it. Getting dressed and undressed for PE is a life skill, going to the toilet unaided, using a knife and fork, holding a pencil correctly... all life skills, all should be taught by parents, at home, before their child starts school. It doesn't happen. Reception class teachers are having to do this.

That's a different point to the one you were making initially. You were talking about things aimed at teenagers, these are aimed at lower primary school children. I agree with those, for what it is worth.
&gt;I don't know if they still force everyone to take woodwork/metalwork at school, but it was compulsory when I was at school &amp; I know how to make a dove tailed joint... never needed to in real life, but I have had to spend £60 on a plumbers call out charge because a tap broke &amp; I didn't know how to fix it. I'm talking basic DIY, put a shelf up, replace a tap, bleed a radiator, stuff that everyone is likely to NEED at some point, not useless stuff. As for childcare being useless, I wish more people had to take childcare classes before reproducing, that is unfeasible to implement, but basic classes at school would enable most parents to have something they could remember back to when they take their precious newborn home for the first time, rather than doing what opur friends did... they put the baby (still in car seat) in the middle of the living room &amp; just sat and stared at her until she cried because they didn't know what else to do!

I'm not sure a lot is compulsary any more. Most thing are just until the end of Year 9, and then if I recall correctly it's only Maths and English that are compulsory for the GCSE. After that, your concentrating on exams until the end of your school career. 

I would agree on the principle of teaching people basic house maintenance and certainly childcare, but I'm not sure the school is the place for that. Plus, teaching 16 year olds about childcare doesn't necessarily convey the message that I think a lot of people want to convey about having children, not that there aren't perfectly good teenage parents around. Ditto with the other stuff, to be honest. I just don't think it's the school's responsibility - not in this day where universities increasingly care about exam results.

&gt;You have mentioned a few times how you 'don't have time' for things... Just how much homework are you getting... because that isn't like the real world either. Not everyone goes home from work &amp; does more work. If the schools were open later, they could actually get that work done in school &amp; when you get home, then you could have free time to do whatever you wanted to do. To be honest, it isn't about making children stay at 'school' all day, if all schools provided breakfast clubs and after school clubs, that would work too - you could still 'be kids' but it would make it easier for people who work full time to manage.

I'm talking about if such things were included on a day-to-day basis within school hours. It's easy enough to make time to do things outside of school, but teaching time is precious and not to be wasted. Regarding those clubs, I know some schools do and some schools don't, it really depends.

&gt;We have 1 x 5 year old daughter and wrap around care (because we have to both work full time to pay our mortgage and buy food and other luxuries) costs us in excess of £2,000 per year (nursery fees were £8,000 per year, so it's still a saving since she started school). We only get 5 weeks per year holidays and our parents all still work full time (and as retirement ages go up further this is more likely to be the case) &amp; no, before you ask, we weren't teenage parents (&amp; neither were our parents), we had both graduated from uni, got jobs and lived on our own for a few years before we did the get married and start a family thing.

I couldn't comment on the situation of having a young child and two full-time parents. Not something I have experience with.

&gt;I don't expect kids to work 50 weeks a year (I certainly get more holidays than that) but I do expect that at some point, unless it becomes possible for one parent to stay at home full time, then something is going to have to change, because even if my other half &amp; I take all our annual leave at different times (so no family holdiays or even family time) then we still get 4 weeks per year LESS annual leave than the schools have holidays. Who do you think should be looking after our 5 year old? Do we just leave her home alone? No, we send her to holiday club, which, because of her age, still has to comply with the EYFS &amp; so is (for her at least) basically school still.

Again, I couldn't comment on children at that age. My comment was mainly directed at the situation in secondary school, especially towards the top. ",0,1362501613,null,0,false,0,c8q6n98,t3_19mqlh,t1_c8q6n98,t1_c8q2hoj,null,1431490079,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Sure opportunistic foxes exist and they will take advantage of human waste. This is, after all, how the wolf was domesticated.

He was rushed into the first team this year out of necessity, and I think it really hurt his development. He went straight from the reserve side straight into first team PL football. You cant expect him to be a top player right away. Our squad currently has about 20 playmakers, but Sterling brings a completely different dynamic. His pace can really stretch the field, and, though he hasn't scored much this season, people seem to forget that he scored a buttload of goals at the youth level. I love Suso as much as the next guy, but we cant put out a full squad of exactly the same type of player (disregard that Spain has done this for years). Even with the addition of Coutinho, Sterling is still a very important player to the future of our club. With time, I think he can develop into a similar type of player as Walcott.

true,samw11,english,Sunny Runny,"&gt; That's a different point to the one you were making initially. You were talking about things aimed at teenagers, these are aimed at lower primary school children. I agree with those, for what it is worth.

Sorry, maybe didn't make the point very well. I don't have much experience of teenagers (apart from having been one) so looking at parents teaching life skills I can look at my own experiences (I wish some had taught me how to budget before uni and cook - my Mother is a dreadful cook, it's probably a good thing that she didn't teach me, but I have never cooked a soufle since school). But I see the difference in my daughter and her classmates already. If people can't teach their child to use the toilet on their own, they aren't likely to teach them to cook/grow vegetables/budget etc either!

&gt; I just don't think it's the school's responsibility - not in this day where universities increasingly care about exam results.

This is true - but aqs you said in your earlier post - university entrance requirements are a different topic that I won't have to worry about again for about 13 years yet. Besides, I have no issues with there being a qualification for life skills (even clumped together in one subject) which universities could look for too. Yes teaching time is precious, but imagine if you had an extra hour a day... see longer days at school would pay off... and imagine a relaxation class to give you that extra down-time too... I'm still not selling this am I.

Ok, nobody wants to work longer, hell, I would love to work part time, but that aint gonna pay the mortgage. 

I do remember how stressful exam years are and if I could change that system (I believe Norway has a much better and less stressful system) then trust me, I would. I hated school.

That's certainly a good point, and one that should probably be fixed. They are, of course, vital skills, and it's an awful problem that parents are neglecting to teach them. You're right - it does not bode well for their futures.

&gt;This is true - but aqs you said in your earlier post - university entrance requirements are a different topic that I won't have to worry about again for about 13 years yet. Besides, I have no issues with there being a qualification for life skills (even clumped together in one subject) which universities could look for too. Yes teaching time is precious, but imagine if you had an extra hour a day... see longer days at school would pay off... and imagine a relaxation class to give you that extra down-time too... I'm still not selling this am I.

Thing is, universities *wont* look for it. They care about academia, not how well you can handle yourself in halls. An extra hour per day at school, sure as an optional extra, but not as a compulsory thing. Having that extra hour also doesn't allow for the previously mentioned extra-curricular activities that students can undertake in their own time, as they have an hour less to do assigned work, or just relax. I have a relaxation class, it's called lunch!

Flegs was popular because, like /u/Retinul said, it was something new, stupid, embarrassing for everyone and lasted way longer than anyone could have guessed. It seems to have pretty much died down now though. 

Ultimately though, it's reddit based reasons for submissions being upvoted - images get upvoted more (as you can see in your link, mostly images), anything funny gets upvoted more and news articles in general don't get much attention.

I will say one thing though - the amount of Bryson/Frazer posts we got last week was ridiculous.

true,nomalas,null,null,"**Defensive Midfield**
------------------------------------------------------------

* First choice is **Lars Bender**. He's quick, young, tough and exactly the type of defensive midfielder Chelsea need. He would probably cost anywhere from £23-28m (or more) and would be a very good purchase at the age of 23. Leverkusen is unwilling to sell, but that hasn't stopped Chelsea before.

* A cheaper option is **Étienne Capoue** (FC Toulouse). He is only 24 so still young, and has been having an excellent season in Ligue 1. He could probably be bought for £12-15m.

**Central Midfield**
-------------------------------------------------------------

* My first choice would be **Éver Banega**. We could probably pick him up for £15-20m and Mata + Champions League football could surely help entice him. At the age of 24, he would be one for the future and has already proven his skill at Valencia.

* Second choice would be **Ilkay Gündogan**. Fantastic player and would place him as first choice but it will be hard to pry him away from Dortmund. It's possible though and I reckon he could be had for £20-25m.

* Third choice is **Fellaini**. We all know what Fellaini is capable of, and we can always use some more Belgian flair. He has really impressed in a more attacking role this season and is why I prefer more traditional CMs like Banega and Gündogan. He would also cost quite a bit more--maybe upwards of £28-32m.

* Another option is **Manuel Fernandes**. He's impressed me at Besiktas this past year and his contract is up next summer so Besiktas would be keen to strike a deal. He is not exactly young at 27, but I still feel that he could be a good option if others fall through. Probably available at around £15-20m.

**Striker**
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* If **Lukaku** is sent out on loan for another year, then my primary target would be **Falcao**. We all know his value and abilities and I think it is worth it to spend big on a player of his quality.

* If **Lukaku** is recalled, I would like to see us try very hard to snatch up **Lewandowski**. He might be set on Bayern, but Chelsea need to at least make their interest known to Dortmund.

* A good secondary striker to play with Lukaku could be **Aleksandr Kokorin**. He is only 21 and building a great name for himself at Dinamo Moscow with 12 goals and 5 assists so far this season. His transfer fee would be very low compared to most of the other targets listed--maybe £12m realistically.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
**If** Lukaku is recalled, I would like to see Chelsea secure **Banega**, **Bender**, and **Lewandowski** or **Kokorin's** signatures. 


If **Lukaku** goes out on loan another season, I would like to see Chelsea pick up **Falcao**, **Banega**, and **Capoue**.

If only two are to be brought in, I would pick **Falcao** and **Bender/Capoue** as **DeBruyne** could (and should) be recalled to play CM due to his excellent form.

As for an animal murdering another animal thats COMPLETELY different, an animal is FORCEED to harm others to survive, we however are not. And animals not being as intelligent as us means they cant fully comprehend the morality of their actions, like a child that hits another child but doesn’t fully understand as to why its play mate has started crying.

While we may be the dominant and most intelligent animal on earth, HOW does that suddenly make our life any more inherently worthwhile to that of any other organism that can feel emotions? Pain, whether is is felt from a human or an ape is still pain, the animal that is experiencing the emotion does not change the matter.

And yes from a human perspective it is odd to view other organisms life as worthwhile as ours, we are naturally speceist, but while we are naturally like this does not make it right.

You don’t give any valid reason as to how a human life is superior to that of any other being capable of feeling emotions.

I'm eighteen and live in Northumberland, and fox hunting is common as shit up here. The fox hunting community hold balls (hehehe) that are actually advertised and extremely popular. One of my best friends is a member of the local hunt, and he is also eighteen. He's been involved with it his whole life. He does not keep hounds (I don't think) but he does have horses, which is probably how he's connected to it. Anyway, he's been attending hunts for as long as he can remember, and has been actively participating in them for as long as he's been allowed.

He's otherwise a pretty cool guy. He's religious and is generally, just... Nice. He goes along to the hunts because, apparently, it's just the done thing. It's not really an excuse, he doesn't have strict parents; they're pretty supportive as far as I can tell, and don't seem like the kind of people who would force him into anything.

Fox hunting is just a part of rural British culture, parliament will never stop people from *ahem* 'exercising their hounds' for a whole load of fairly obvious reasons, but that doesn't make it right.

The European Commission, which is appointed by the European Council (the heads of state/government) and approved by the European Parliament proposes a law, for example this one.

Then it's voted on in the European Parliament (the lower house) and the Council of the European Union (the upper house). The parliament represents the people of Europe, i.e you and me, and is directly elected. The Council of the European Union (don't get it confused with the European Council) is a collection of ministers depending on the legislation proposed. In this case, finance ministers. Its job is to represent the interests of government.

Then the legislation proposed by the commission has to be approved by the Parliament and the Council, just like it does in any other bicameral system. This article is about George Osborne fighting it in the Council.

To me this seems to be a gross simplification (I know you warned it was a shit analogy, but it applies to positive discrimination as a whole not just your example).

To give my own shakily premised thoughts; the majority of non-white people I know are first or second generation immigrants who come from middle class to wealthy backgrounds. They, from birth, have a vast advantage over people, of any race, who are on the bottom rung of society - for the same reasons that the white middle class of this country have an advantage over the white working class/disadvantaged. (obviously I am not saying this applies to all non whites in this country, nor am I saying that there are not still imbalances which affect the people I know)

Though there have been historical injustices and institutionalised imbalances the greatest imbalance today is not based in race/gender/sexuality or any other protected status/minority. Today the imbalance of opportunity in my opinion comes from socio-economic background - regardless of race. To me this is where institutionalised attempts to redress the widening gulf of inequality should be focussed, and in my mind would do more good.

Obviously redressing this in the employment market is not as easy, and it has to come from investment in education and support for those in need.

We've got an account at work, mostly because we need to know how the system works, so as to help people we work with. So far we've logged about twenty jobs that are clearly suspicious, each time reporting them to the DWP. Despite assurances from the end of last year that the system would be made more secure, these fraudulent ""vacancies"" continue to be posted.

As of March 1st the terms of use for Universal Jobmatch have been altered, specifically indemnifying the DWP of any responsibility for loss of, among other things, personal data, financial hardship etc. etc. as a result of using the system.

That's why I recommended the OP consider passing the information onto his local MP - if, s/he keeps finding them. Obviously one or two can just be passed onto the DWP for them to deal with. But if they're finding them on a regular basis, I'd advise passing it onto an MP, for the issue to be raised - or at least, so that the OP can say they've got a record of their concerns.",0,1362514465,null,0,false,0,c8qb2ft,t3_19puwm,t1_c8qb2ft,t1_c8qax1y,null,1431492356,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,Eddie_Hitler,cnty-uk,Scotsman in East Anglia,"Cap the bonuses?  No problem, just increase basic pay to cover it.  

Let's start by making executive bonus payments outright illegal in companies which are any percentage state owned, such as RBS.  Salaries in banks like that should be set by the government and, if you want to split hairs, Stephen Hester is sort of a civil servant.  Let's also dictate in law how bonuses are divvied out - only 10% should be in cash, the rest in shares which can be taken completely tax free after, say, five years.

Another thing I should point out is that when someone ""takes home £x"", it doesn't mean ""£x"" magically lands in their bank account one day.  It's usually combined renumeration i.e. they might have £1m cash (which gets brutally taxed if they're playing nice and not fiddling things in St Helier), a large lump sum dropped into a pension which they can't claim until 60 and, maybe, £300k worth of shares just given to them free of charge.

true,Eddie_Hitler,cnty-uk,Scotsman in East Anglia,"I'll tell you a little story: I went to one of your ""Oxbridge-reject"" universities for two years before switching to a ""lesser"" one which appears at something like 12 on the league tables, or did at that point.

Quite honestly?  The teaching quality was 95% identical at both institutions.  In actual fact, University #2 was a much better and friendlier atmosphere all round; the lecturers really wanted to get stuck in and help, whereas University #1's lecturers walked on water and couldn't understand how the students couldn't understand, if you see what I mean.  I felt much more inspired and connected to the real world at University #2 whereas University #1 was mountains of theory totally out of context and that I know now you would never, ever use in the workplace.  Which instutition did and employers do still prefer?  Hint, it's not #1.

There has been or was (during my time there) some ""dissent in the ranks"" at University #1 because people were fed this fairy tale about how awesome it was, but some felt very let down because the academic chops weren't what was promised.  My cousin started the year after I did and stayed to the end of his degree, and even he said people he knew were questioning the quality of it and word was getting out about its reputation not being entirely deserved.

Oh, and the whole business of Oxford and Cambridge not teaching a subject, but then start working on it and instantly become the best by reputation alone?  Fuck that.

They are used a lot by both large chains and franchise controllers to provide performance metrics.  Used correctly (and combined with the right statistical analysis) it's a quite an effective way to judge how well individual outlets are performing in terms of customer service and product quality.  

Most chain fast-food outlets will have a mystery/secret shopper come in on average every one/two weeks, these shoppers rate the quality of the food and the standard of service.  A francise outlet will have to meet minium standards to retain the francise (and possibly pay penalies for subpar standards).  A company outlet will have bonuses adjusted based on the results and will fire the manager if results are consistently crappy.  The manager may also fire/demote members of staff for consistently crappy results (the mystery shoppers have to record who serves them by looking at the employees name badge[s], the time and date of the report is also used to record the performance of the *team leader* in charge at the time).

I believe most retail chains use similar procedures too.

Yossi Benayoun: Well i think he's not good enough, he's old also some of his statements about the club is abit iffy.

Michael Essien: We all love the bison but he's just not good enough anymore

Florent Malouda: Not much needs to be said really

Fernando Torres: It's time to cut our losses and sell him...

**Recall**

Kevin De Bryune: Doing splendidly in Bremen and is ready for the first team, he's also very versatile.

Romelu Lukaku: He's in my opinion ready for first team action, if torres gets sold he's looking on a lot of game time

**Potential Recalls**

Thibaut Courtious: As good as he's playing he's close to 100% ready to take over and be a good keeper after Cech but Cech still gots lots to give and i think its more beneficial for Courtious to stay at A.Madrid for 1 more season and arrive to Chelsea in 1 or 2 seasons.

Nathaniel Chalobah: I think he could be a rotating player next year but its probably better for his overall development for him to stay on loan for one more season or so. The perfect situation would be if Watford makes it to the premier league.

Players like Mceachran, Kalas, PVA and Piazon could all play for the first team aswell next year imo.

**Potential players to bring into the team**

If we look at defense the biggest prospect that is targeted is **Luke Shaw**. The fact that he's a chelsea fan and only 17 of course makes him a good buy, but the LB spot is pretty stacked with Bertrand, PVA and Ash 

In the midfield a 1 or 2 players could be brought in. I would personally like to see **Victor Wanyama** from Celtic as he's abit of a beast and reminds me of Essien, other options in the CDM is **Sven and Lars Bender**. I am not sure which one is the better but Lars is probably a easier target due to which clubs they play in. **Maroune Fellaini** is a players that a lot of us have been wanting for a while, even though i would love to see Ake-Luiz-Fellaini play i am not sure he would fit into the formation and the way we play... **Étienne Capoue** is another name that has been tossed up, but I personally have no real exprience about this player.

In the more offensive part of the pitch a proven striker is on top of the list and **Falcao** probably the most obvious answer, he's an amazing palyer but he's not exactly cheap. ** Robert Lewandowski** might be persued but i dont think Dortmund will be ready to let him go. I would prefer to see a quick poacher type of striker brought into the team to support Ba and Lukaku and be used as a supersub, abit like Chicarito... 
**Aleksandr Kokorin** would be such a player. 

**EDIT:** **Andre Schürrle** is another good option to be the poacher, subbing type of guy. He could also be used on a wing if needed",1,1362519603,null,0,1362561403,0,c8qd0hr,t3_19pwcz,t1_c8qd0hr,t3_19pwcz,null,1431493198,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

true,VictorSage,tardis,TARDIS,"I don't think so at all. I posted this in offmychest (and here but it doesn't seem to be going over well): 

I struggle with depression. It's something that I've just recently come to terms with. I've dealt with it all of my life actually. But I've realized something. I cope with life SO much better when I act like I'm someone else.

I grew up with a love for books, cinema and television. Over the years, I would watch something in a movie, or on tv, and someone on that show that was looked at as ""Cool"" or ""Popular"", I would emulate. It sounds silly, but little ticks and nuances would be adapted into my everyday life. But that was small potatoes to how I am now...

I've recently (say in the passed, year) developed a delayed love for Doctor Who, Harry Potter and a few other series. And Especially Doctor Who out of the lot, I'm finding myself acting more and more like the 10th Doctor (David Tennant). The vibrancy of his take on the Doctor is totally who I want to be. No I don't speak with a British Accent but I have found myself saying things that he does more and more (Think: Brilliant, Bollucks, etc but not Allons-Y and such). The way he problem solves, I find myself trying to work things out (I'm self employed and find that I have to think a lot of my work through to solve problems).

And it makes me happy. I listen to soundtracks, theme songs, but only with ""Hopeful Notes"". in them. Songs that inspire and remind me of certain scenes...

And it makes me happy. I look into space and imagine worlds that we could one day as a civilization may travel too. Probably not in my life time, but how whimsical that notion could be and how it may play out now...

And it makes me happy. So though my wife and I may have not been getting along the greatest for the past few months (it's getting better), and though finances aren't the greatest (not getting so much better... yet), though my kids may not have everything that I would want to provide for them right now...

I look for the Hopeful Notes in life. And it makes me happy. Currently listening to ""Can I Come With You"" from the Series 5 Doctor Who Soundtrack...

And it makes me happy.

While I don't believe I'm clinically depressed... I think I could be borderline. I dunno.. life has been dealing one two punches at me lately.. but I'm fighting back.

Whatever happened to simply ignoring fridge logic, accepting that you are in fact watching a fictitious show, and that ultimately the reasons these shows are fictitious is because if everything could actually work we'd have tried it by now?

It's the same problem you run into with grammar nazis: yes, we understand your hatred of people who abuse the English language is founded upon scores of 13-year-old-idiots who couldn't be bothered to spell doing as such. Nevertheless, if someone has a completely acceptable sentence and then happened to use ""your"" instead of ""you're,"" it's not that big of a deal.

Essentially, ""the doctor lies"" is something that should only be whinged about in context. If we're using that to explain away what would essentially be a Deus Ex Machina or some other critical plot hole(I mean, how would a velociraptor end up inside your helicopter?) then yes, I can see the problem.

But really, really, it's still fiction. It's still a work of art created by a team of writers and actors and the whole lot and depending on time constraints, the script isn't always going to have room, time, or even logic to rationalize your whole perception of the universe. Fiction is hinged on suspension of disbelief, and yes, half-cocked pseudo-scientific ramblings can help foster that.

It reminds me of Chelsea against Barca last year, when Terry was (rightfully) sent off. Chelsea, despite the fact I despise them, hung on and defended stoutly against the mighty Barca at the Nou Camp no less. For all of the praise United received, they lost the tie in 4 minutes, incredibly quickly after the sending off. Surely a better defence may have held on for longer, increased the pressure on Madrid, maybe nicking a goal on the counter when Madrid overcommitted but no. The red card did not mean the game was a foregone conclusion, if United stopped Madrid scoring then we wouldn't be talking about a red card (or the wrongly disallowed goal and Rafael handball).

Foxes will attack and kill lambs. They will also attack and kill newly born calves. They will attack and kill any sickly or weak or heavily pregnant sheep. 

Foxes do eat poultry. If you secure your chickens with electric fences they will eventually learn to jump through the fence in between the ticks. If you use chicks wire they will dig underneath it. When the fox gets in, he will gonona rampage and a single fox is liable to kill 50-70 chickens in one go. He will take and eat maybe two.

My number two concern about sheep isn't foxes, but foxes are definitely higher than dogs on the list. Other farmers teach their dogs not to chase sheep. Nobody teaches foxes not to eat our lambs. 

On the other hand, foxes are definitely the number one concern when it comes to chickens or any other poultry. We used to keep 12,000 free range chickens. They had protective electric fences around their fields but the foxes learn to jump through the fences between pulses. Every night we had to shut all the doors on all the chicken houses. That took about 45 minutes at around 11 o clock. The few times that we left a door open by mistake, foxes invariably got in and killed upwards of fifty chickens.

I still think you miss my previous point completely. 

&gt;The UK is doing pretty well compared to some southern european nations, and OK overall considering the magnitude of this recession.

I like this. It shows how no matter what democracy you come from the top guy is a PR man and is self-serving and corrupt as the next guy. Take Italy for example - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20857664

Italy has a horrendous economy yet the PM is paying his wife €36m... Maybe he should inject that money into the italian government... Or maybe if he did that his wife might let the tabloids know something they shouldn't...?

&gt;So earn more?

I laugh at this common phrase really fucking hard every time I hear how out of touch it is with post 2008 Britain.

I left uni with a design qualification - I was applying to everything under the 70 mile radious of where I lived. Even had one reply which stated they'd had 160 applicants for 1 shitty design job. This was when I started really searching for anything... Got McJected, Morrisons didn't want me plus a few others.

I did finally get a job and I saved HARD! I saved to get the fuck out of Britain for a bit... And now I'm living the dream away from my beloved rock for a bit. Sort of hoping the dust settles with regards to jobs, corruption, tax avoidance and most importantly racial politics (Although with UKIP on the rise it is sounding worse)

true,erythro,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt;It is my argument that there is no difference between the inherent value of a human and animal life .. as both a human and fox are capable of feeling emotions and as such are both equally deserving of life and that the killing of a fox is just as immoral as the killing of a human.

Or to paraphrase

**Premises:**  
**1** Humans and foxes are capable of feeling emotions  
**2** Being capable of feeling emotions is what makes you deserving of life and gives your life inherent value and it is true as much for any other being capable of feeling emotions
**3** It is immoral to kill something deserving of life (you didn't state this, but your reasoning rests on it and I don't think you'd object)

**Conclusions:**  
**1** Humans and foxes are of equal inherent value, and equally deserve life, which follows from premises 1 and 2  
**2** It is just as immoral to kill a fox as a human, which follows from the first conclusion and premise 3

If this argument is somehow not a correct reflection of yours please feel free to correct it.

I don't and I didn't question premise 1 (though I think there are problems with that, it's a waste of time discussing it, and others are trying to anyway) but instead question premise 2.

I don't derive ""deserving of life"" from ""capability to feel emotion"".  I think if a human were to somehow to lose that ability to feel emotion they would somehow be ok to murder.  If someone was to die having lost the ability to feel emotion there still would be a loss.  Things are more complicated than reflected with premise 2.

&gt;And while you may think otherwise it is simply a form of natural speceism, after all if animals didn’t value and as such look after their own kind more than other animals they wouldn’t last long in the wild.

You may be able to suggest a sociological reason for why I question premise 2, but that doesn't free you from having to defend it now, does it?",0,1362528942,null,0,false,0,c8qgaah,t3_19pauu,t1_c8qgaah,t1_c8qfa5f,null,1431494753,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The page was updated on the 1st March 2013 so it seems pretty up to date. Yes, that is the official government website for the UK. Yes, it is a bit shit.

If you're 16/17 you can drink beer, wine or cider - but only if an adult (somebody over the age of 18) pays. 

Also - you must have a meal with it.

*HOWEVER*

It seems some places can either refuse or may not be legally allowed to do this. Essentially, ask your Dad to ask at the bar/counter and if they say it is ok then go for it. Make sure you have some form of ID that shows how old you are though just in case. Passport, driving license, etc.

true,rougecathy,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire (in exile in Surrey),"I used to work for a mystery shopping firm in the summer when I was a student.  I was doing data input, but when I went back to uni I did some mystery shopping.  I'm not sure you could do it as a full time role in the way I did it (this was a long time ago).  There was no wage, just expenses and they would cover the cost of what you bought (which you got to keep).  The big client at the time was Superdrug.  We had to go in and buy stuff, and while we were doing that note things like if the shop was clean and tidy.  We had to do things like buy 2 things that were on 3 for 2 (to see if staff alerted us to the offer), ask an embarrasing question (I would ask for extra large condoms for my boyfriend) and spill something.  ""Spill something"" usually meant putting too much tester of foundation or something on your hand so you had to ask for a tissue, but being a klutz I managed to knock over and smash some bottles of nail varnish.
I assume that nowadays they must get minimum wage, back in the darkest 90s as I said we were essentially being paid with what we bought and as you had to buy what was on offer I ended up with literally 5 years worth of baby oil, all bought in one glorious day where I hit every Superdrug in Liverpool.  My second date with my partner was me dragging him along to Andy's Records in Southport (I had forgotten about that until I started typing) and spending the day in Southport in the cold (I wish I could remember what CD I bought...).

Because of our town's small and insular nature, most people find it best to live in our university's hall of residence, Andrew Melville Hall. And it really is just that: you are given a bed in a massive hall (shared with every other resident, naturally), in a building that looks like two ships crashing into each other. There is a wonderful sense of community from this, and mandatory communal showers in the morning are a pleasant time of bonding. There's also safety in numbers: when the marauding rape gangs from Dundee pay us a visit, our living arrangement gives us the flexibility to defend our residence effectively.

As you can imagine, getting a place at Andrew Melville Hall is very competitive. Places are given based on merit of such things as intelligence, stamina, and ability to adapt in times of crisis. Unfortunately, this does not include personal hygiene, but you get used to the smell; it becomes charming and homely, eventually. You can only apply in first year, but once you're in, you're in for your whole degree course. There is a camp-site provided out the back of the hall, but this fills up quickly, and is generally the preserve of the weak, the foreign, and the scientists who inevitably populate North Haugh. They do play a vital part as human shields against the Dundonians, so it's better to be in than out.

I had a situation with 1&amp;1 about a year ago where I could physically not retry a payment option. One of my customers had had their payment lapse on their account and received an email from 1&amp;1 saying if they did not pay in 7 days, they would be chased up by independent debt collectors (I kid you not - that was 1&amp;1s wording). The customer claimed that no matter what they tried, they could not process their new bank card with their 1&amp;1 domain account. I took a look and sure enough, when entering their card number and hitting ""Retry payment"" it simply stated in big red error letters ""Error"" - with no description whatsoever! Naturally the customer was very concerned whether the payment had been taken out of their account several times, retrying the process over and over, so a phone call to the premium rate 1&amp;1 support number was made.

After 20 minutes of being on hold and finally talking to one of their (quite frankly rubbish) support team I got a very unhelpful individual who basically said ""Its your fault, our website works fine, if you don't provide us with valid payment details in 7 days we're going to cancel your account and give your details to debt collectors"". I explained it was not our fault and was concerned about multiple payments being taken out but no - they were adamant it was our fault. This is from a leading brand in Europe, mind you.. After a further 20 minutes talking to them they agreed to process the payment over the telephone and to block all previous payments from that card (to safeguard the customer from paying too many times). Surely enough the payment went through and you know the first thing I did?

true,waiting4timelord,tardis,TARDIS,"Not quite depression, do I did go through that a few years ago, but Doctor Who did assist me some in my trust issues.

Every since events in middle school, I have had problems with trusting people, mostly guys, both emotionally and physically. When I watched my first episode of Doctor Who, seeing Rose run off with a man she barely knew and the trust she put in him, it blew my mind. I watched as her relationship with the Doctor flourished, and it made me wonder if there were real people who could be trusted like the Doctor was. 
Fast forward to the summer, I am working at a camp with a friend who I had known for a few years, but since he was a guy I was unable to completely trust him. He was one of my best friends, but I tearfully explained to him at the beginning of the summer that as much as I wanted to I couldn't get myself to a place where I could trust him. It was a struggle to even talk to some of the guys on staff because of my trust issues. 

Doctor Who wasn't the only thing that helped me get through all of it. It was a Christian camp, and I am a believer in God, so the unity I found with everyone there and the faith and hope I can find in my relationship with God and his Word in the Bible, along with the inspiration and hope I felt when I thought about the Doctor and how everyone he meets trusts him, and how he can genuinely care about him, along side the boys I was working with showing me that not all men are like the ones I had met, I was able to get through the worst of my trust issues. 

Anxiety (and depression) are beasts though, its still a struggle to trust people, but for the most part, I am better.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;1)Do you eat meat?

Like a fiend.

&gt;2)If you do would you be willing to kill, butcher and cook it yourself?

Yes of course.  Clearly it's not necessary nor practical for everyone to do so in the modern world, but I think it's useful and morally appropriate that people should know something of the process and be prepared to psychologically.  There's a real danger in the degree to which many/most people have become alienated from nature and the realities of agriculture/food which manifests itself in many ways.  Not least, the issues of conservation and industrial farming.

&gt;3) Is it right for a farmer to shoot foxes if the foxes are killing lambs?

Of course, but there needs to be a balance between the need for humans to have enough food and foxes to have enough wild space.  I don't go off on rants about speciesism, but my clear moral position is that we share the planet with other species and it shouldn't be ours to do with entirely as we will merely because we are orders of magnitude dominant.

&gt;4) Is it right for farmers to shoot other edible pests, pigeon, rabbits et al?

Again, yes.  I am opposed to animal cruelty, but keeping down pests and keeping nature in balance is an important feature of countryside management.  We don't have the apex predators for this to occur naturally these days.

&gt;5) Do you have/use any animal products what so ever?

Yes - leather shoes, belts, jacket, wallet, etc.

&gt;6) What animals wouldn't you eat?

Dog, cat, rat/mouse, insects (again), monkey, dolphin, whale, any of the great apes...  Companion animals are mostly for irrational reasons, some animals are too ""dirty"", unpleasant to think of eating, and I just don't like the taste of insects - very bitter.

3. I'd rather they took other approaches first. But ultimately I can't blame someone for trying to protect their livelihood. I abhor blood sports but that's different.

4. As above really. Don't make it into a game, and if possible make use of what you've killed, but otherwise I can't really complain.

5. Yes. As well as eating meat, I consume a lot of milk and cheese and I believe in medical testing on animals, but not cosmetics. As to the latter point I don't have the financial luxury to be choosy often, though I don't think many shampoos are tested on animals any more.

6. I wouldn't eat anything endangered. I abhor the gastronomic clubs of the turn of the century that ate rare species to extinction. But aside from that I think it's a bit absurd to get choosy. If something isn't harmful, I don't think I really have the right to demand that some parts of animals go to waste.

2) This question doesn't really apply to me but: No, I'm not a fan of the slaughter of animals for food in the vast majority of cases. 

3) Why are they shooting foxes? Because they're 'pests'. They are pests because they cause harm to the farmers business, a business which is entirely based upon using animals for profit.

The recent move for a badger cull and (around a decade ago) the massive cull of sheep suffering from foot and mouth disease (or even potentially afflicted by) had nothing to do with a concern for the welfare of the animals themselves. It was motivated by a concern about the profitability of the agriculture industries that involved animal slaughter. 

4) In terms of causing harm to their vegetable crop? Either you should consider them as an inevitable part of the harvest (in the similar way that a certain amount of shoplifting is an inevitable part of owning a shop) or possibly you could look for a deterence which is less harmful. There will be a minimal amount of pilfering by wild animals, but that's not strong enough grounds to kill them. 

5) I still have a jumper made from wool that my grandma knitted for me before she died. I have no intention of throwing that away.

Lewandowski? That's hilarious. Guy is leaving a team which is doing very well in Champion's League, and won the league two years in a row. He will play for a top 10 club, most likely Madrid.

Jovetic? Highly unlikely. Man is worth $30. Again, will probably stay at Fiorentina until going to a top 10 club.

Dzeko? Wages.

Mario Gomez? Shit hold up play. We already have a poacher. Also Wages.

Michu? He JUST signed a contract extension, so while he may be available, it will be for more than he is worth. Not a Levy deal.

Honestly, I think our best options are 1) Benteke - For his quality he could be very cheap if Villa go under, 2) Bony - Quality and could be affordable.

Sorry, I know, ""To Dream is To Do"". But have some realism about it. We're having a good run. If we finish 3rd place, we can attract some good talent, if 2nd, maybe even better. However, those in this thread that are assuming we'll be making a run at the league next year... I dunno.

Honestly, I think that looking at your family tree is fun, but actually doing the legwork is the biggest reason to do it. He loves leafing through old books, newspapers and records and it's given him a chance to reconnect with old family members and to meet with loads more he didn't know existed.

You could just put the basics down on paper and your 'present' could be giving him the opportunity to explore it further.

That said, here's what you might find useful:-

* [Who Do You Think You Are? software from the BBC](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Think-Family-Maker-Deluxe-Version/) - This is great for keeping records and that's where he puts all his information
* [The National Archives](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/visit/default.htm) - This has birth. death, marriage, army, legal documents on basically everybody who's done any of those things. You can go and trawl through their stuff for free and you can, I think, book an appointment with an assistant who'll talk you through it and help.
* [BBC family history guide](http://www.bbc.co.uk/familyhistory/) - Pretty much everything you'll need to know, as you'd expect from the BBC.

My dad's really into it now, going back several hundred years. He has stuff I'd never even thought of, like special presentation cases and gloves to handle old documents.

4. Yes. It's preferable to the governments method of dropping a lab rabbit with miximetosis (query sp?) in amongst the wild population to control it. Besides which, it's certainly better to kill it and eat it than just kill it and waste it.

5. Yes - leather mostly, gelatine &amp; I have an antique family heirloom fur coat - can't wear it (get too much grief &amp; don't want anyone throwing paint over it), but can't throw it away either - is a 1920's/30's one that belonged to my Nanna's Mum.

6. I won't eat horse, cat or dog, well, knowingly at least (I'm British &amp; we can be odd about that sort of thing) &amp; I chickened out of the escargot and frogs legs in France - although my brother claims they're lovely.

7. You didn't ask but I'll answer it anyway - if I am perfectly honest, I eat meat mainly because my family does and I am too lazy to cook multiple meals, but, I don't actually like the taste of some meats. I don't like turkey (I will eat it, but I actually prefer tofu), I don't like pork (let the downvoting commence) and I don't like the taste of steak - I can eat beef, but it has to be in small quantities. We tend to cook mostly with lamb and chicken, although I do like ostrich and crocodile, but they tend to be rare as they aren't readily available in supermarkets. I am partial to duck, but I will often chose the vegetarian option in a restaurant, just beacause I enjoy them a little bit more.

There are good reasons why police forces aren't allowed to strike.  The potential costs of one day of no police are not proportional to the time off.  Criminals can concentrate their lawlessness on that one day.

Now, being entirely a free-marketeer, I would be perfectly happy for the police to strike if they weren't a state-protected monopoly.

Ok, so the EU must have done something to ban this then?

Oh, so it's not the EU, which just says, rather reasonably that you should conserve fish stocks, it's actually our own environment agency? You know, the UK sovereign one.

&gt;“The problem is that the Government has introduced a policy which closes down mixed stock fisheries. *We say every fishery should be looked at individually*.” 

Hmm. Again, nothing suggesting the EU has banned this. Note the last sentence.

true,Xuth,eng-lancashire,Southener in the North,"Well, I'm not actually sure - and this presumes that the upper House of Lords still survives. But I see it going a bit like this:

As the Queen is head of state she already 'sends' for whomever it is who has been chosen to become prime minister (this is technically what happens ceremonially after an election anyway - the winner is 'invited' to form a government.)

Constitutional convention would suggest that she must send for somebody who can command the confidence of the House of Commons, and in modern times this has always meant sending for the leader of the largest party following an election (or the largest coalition).

However, if everyone in the House of Commons has been turned into politician soup, then it creates a bit of a Royal mess.

With the nation in turmoil after it's largest ever terrorist attack, and essentially without a government - there would be an immediate need for a caretaker government to form to maintain order, avoid any coups and prevent London from turning into Mogadishu. 

Essentially, (if we presume there is no single politician remaining) the interim leader could be anyone who could command the confidence of the nation for a short but traumatic time.

This would be an occasion where the Queen would call on her real (albeit constitutionally locked away) powers, because she would have to make the decision directly without time for a public election. She would presumably consult with previous privy Councillors, including former prime ministers and cabinet members (yes, even Blair and Brown), the leaders of the Scottish, Northern Irish and Welsh governments, ambassadors - pretty much anyone with political knowledge.

A retired prime minister, a senior cross-bench Lord, or senior politician, or a former senior public servant could be called for. Obviously it needs to be someone trustworthy, who is likely to be a strong figure, but not someone who people resent (*cough* Blair *cough*) or who might take the opportunity to stage their own power-grab. From this an emergency cabinet of similar characters would be formed to rule for the weeks it takes to establish an election (and find people willing to run as MPs).

We also should remember that the House of Lords, as well as the members of the Supreme Court would likely still be alive. With a cabinet (which is very powerful in the UK anyway), upper house and judiciary still in tact they could hold things together well enough in the interim. 

As soon as is possible, an emergency General Election would be held nationwide and, a soon as a new house is elected, the caretaker prime minister would presumably resign, and advise the Queen to send for the leader of the largest party in the, legitimate, new House. The caretaker government would rely very, very heavily on the civil service (as I said, the people who keep government running usually, and don't change after elections normally) to keep things ticking over. The new politicians wouldn't know how to run a country without them! 

Edit: It also occurs to me that there are MPs who simply don't attend Parliament anyway - certain Irish nationalists I believe. That would cause a constitutional nightmare since they would presumably still be alive despite Parliament going all Guy Fawkes.

The question of whether I could kill my own meat weighed on me for a while.  Whilst at uni I lived with a vegan and a veggy.  They never forced any bullshit on me, but it just made me remain wary of not being a jerkoff about eating meat.  I was also (independently) very aware that to me, meat was  a product bought in plastic boxes - like it just appeared for stacking purposes at supermarkets - I wasn't happy about this - especially after hearing a few children answering questions about where chicken came from.  Some of them had absolutely no idea it came from a once live animal.  Sounds funny, but it's one of those things isn't it - if you're never told, you'll probably never know.

My girlfriends dad is a farmer, and one time he asked if I wanted to go help cull rabbits on his farm, as they ate his crops and need to be kept under control occasionally.  I took the opportunity, on the proviso that I ate whatever I killed, and it wasn't just wasted.  That evening I hunted three rabbits.  Me and the girlfriend then gutted, skinned, jointed and cooked them.  It was a really enlightening experience.  It certainly did not make me believe eating meat was inhumane or wrong at all, but I certainly *understood* how it all worked much better, and would advise doing it to all meat-eaters.

&gt;Policy Exchange thinktank has estimated it costs society £14bn

Some selective quoting from The Guardian. Here's what [the report](http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/publications/cough%20up%20-%20march%2010.pdf
) actually said,

&gt;Taxation of tobacco contributes £10 billion to HM Treasury annually; however, we calculate that the costs to society from smoking are much greater at £13.74 billion. Every cigarette smoked is costing us money. These societal costs comprise not only the cost of treating smokers on the NHS (£2.7 billion) but also the loss in productivity from smoking breaks (£2.9 billion) and increased absenteeism (£2.5 billion); the cost of cleaning up cigarette butts (£342 million); the cost of smoking related house fires (£507 million), and also the loss in economic output from the deaths of smokers (£4.1 billion) and passive smokers (£713 million). 

The report doesn't really take into account savings made from early deaths either. Frankly if there's to be any argument on these sort of things it should be done on compassionate grounds because misleading and pseudo-intellectual financial claims from The Guardian aren't convincing anyone.

""The first contact an offender has with the criminal justice system is usually with the police"" [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice).

""Seeking my own justice privately"", if you read it like it's in a movie does, I accept, sound like I'm planning to go out with a bat.  Be aware: I have no capability of that, I am neither violent nor inclined to be.  I mean justice exactly as you do, and you have to read my sentence with that in mind.  If I sue someone in civil court then I am seeking justice privately -- it does not mean bypass the law -- it means that I want the law to be applied to someone who has wronged me. Without the police to use force on my behalf (being that I am not capable of it), where should I turn?

I see no problem with a society in which all justice is civil.  I also see no theoretical problems (although, I will accept practical problems) with an entirely privatised civil court system -- it is simply two parties agreeing to be bound by an arbitrator. (and people [cleverer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2WhnOHCpKs) than I argue the same)

You accuse me of not knowing what terms mean; but it would be better to assume that I do know what they mean and read them as such instead of guessing and then using that guess as a straw man.

&gt; This means the police have more powers than you do. It does not mean that you have no right to defend yourself. You do have the right to defend yourself.

I have _some_ right to defend myself; but the fact is that the police have more.

&gt; You assume those powers exist for the police to defend you. 

What other reason would I have for wanting them to have those powers then?  The police have those powers to defend me, or by proxy me through making society at general safer, and finding/collecting those who have transgressed.  All of those are a defence of me, a law-abiding citizen, even if they are indirect.

---

None of the above changes my central point: the police are special in our society, and one part of that speciality is that they cannot be given the right to strike.

This is the main reason why Scotland receives more per capita (on this one chunk of government expenditure) than certain parts of England. That combined with the way it is calculated.

The block grant is determined by taking the previous years block grant and adding the change in Departmental Expenditure Limits (DEL's) for England multiplied by % devolved and then multiplied by a population factor. Same again the next year and the year after and so on.

The population in England has greatly increased since 1979 while the population in Scotland has fallen and only recently come back up to the level in 1979.

'Mental' vs physical harm. Whether or not you believe the evidence for secondhand smoke, there is a lot of it.

We have the freedom from your habit inside.

true,erowidtrance,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;Rights are one thing but cigarettes are highly addictive, removing for most people the choice to say yes or no once they're hooked on something which will either kill them or reduce their lifespan.

Addiction can simply be a psychological attachment that is hard to break. You can be addicted to cleaning, eating cakes or basically anything. 

One of my friends was relatively recently diagnosed with diagnosed with diabetes and found it very hard to limit certain foods that she was used to, even a year on she still craves things that she isn't really meant to eat. She has basically the same psychological addiction to overcome as any smoker so by your reasoning her free choice to stop herself eating certain foods that are bad for her is severely limited so they should be banned. 

Also you don't even consider how pointless banning things is when people want them and often more damaging than making them legal. Just look at prohibition, look at how the drug war deaths are effecting mexico, look at the drug use rate in America despite insanely harsh sentences &amp; look at how Portugal is benefiting from it's new laws.

I'll tell the same short story I always end up telling - the reason I feel passionately about this. I lost my uncle to throat cancer a few years ago..  it was not a quick end for him. It was painful not just for him but for my mother, *his* mother and the rest of our family who could only do what they could for support. We made him as comfortable as possible but ultimately his life ending was also an end to that suffering. 

He developed throat cancer because he smoked. 

I leave the story at that because it really does speak for itself - it's a horrible thing to see happen to someone, it's painful and (in his case) lethal. I cannot understand how smoking is worth it, given those risks. 

That - in turn - makes me angry when anyone tries to justify the habit. Any justification is really the masking of an addiction. We don't tolerate less sociable addictions as a society (with class A drugs being deplorable to most and something ""you need to seek help with"")  and yet when it comes to smoking, the non-smokers are the bad guys for forcing the smokers into the cold, rather than letting them carry on in pubs etc?

No it wouldn't, you simply say people are allowed to smoke in pubs but only inside dedicated rooms. That doesn't mean every pub must have a room because it would be the publicans free choice as to whether it was a smoking or non-smoking pub. 

My philosophy revolves around not forcing people to do what they want if they're not harming anyone in the process. No pub would be forced to provide for smokers if it didn't want to but likewise no pub would be forced to stop people freely choosing to smoke in their establishment.

true,epemberton,yorkshire,People's Republic of South Yorkshire,"I wrestle with the issue of press freedom in Venezuela because whilst I abhor the might of the state being used to stifle free speech I can actually see where Chavez came from on this issue.

His power base was overwhelmingly in the poor and the dispossessed and he was loathed by the middle classes and businessmen for his tax and spend policies.  Had a truly free populist press been able to take root in the country, I don't doubt for a second that the vast majority would be propagandising rags owned by wealthy moguls trying to convince the poor against their own interest.  Despite what is inferred in the article above, I do believe that his was a genuine electoral mandate awarded through free elections (I will confess that I have not looked into this issue in great detail, but as far as I'm aware the international election observers were not overly concerned with his recent electoral victories)

Again, I don't like to sound like a Chavez apologist, but the reaction on Twitter and elsewhere has been utterly polarized and unable to grasp the nuance of a man who did both good and bad things for his country. 
 
It has made me question the legitimacy of a 'free press' in our society however.  Anyone with a hard line policy on helping the poor at the expense of the rich doesn't stand a hope in hell of getting anywhere near power in this country - As soon as they did, you can bet that the people who control the printing presses would start getting mighty nervous and we would start to see a lot of copy about what a terrible and wicked person they were,  how their policies make no economic sense and electing them would drive the country to ruin.

You can argue all you like about the relative arguments of such a position from a hard nosed economic standpoint, and I understand that directly socialist policies are a tough sell in our globalised economy.  However, it still seems to me that those with the means to do so will always go out of their way to oppose such policies purely out of greed and self interest.

That is already banned. So, yes?     

You can be arrested for being drunk, for driving drunk, for being drunk and disorderly (i.e. drunk and loud/threatening). There are tons of laws that allow police to pick up drunkards.    

&gt; Hmm I've head that argument before about staff in private clubs. my answer would be only employ smokers or have members act as staff, problem solved.    

Doesn't matter if your staff smoke. You're still putting them in an environment where they're exposed to a carcinogen all day. I'd think it would be reasonable if staff used respirators while at work however, that seems like a compromise - kind of like asbestos cleaners.     

&gt; There's a load of older people in the UK for whom going to a club and having a smoke and a drink was a important piece of their social life and it's been banned, which I think is unfair.

true,thecritic06,cnty-wales,Aberystwyth Yorkshireman,"With about 95% of dogs, it's about your approach and body language. Some are tamer than others of course but few people own dogs that are wantonly aggressive because they don't make good pets.

If you're being approached by a dog you don't know, be careful not to shrink away from it or show other body language suggesting fear. You don't want to appear submissive. Do, however, keep your hands well out of the way until it has had the chance to sniff you. If a dog is dead set on biting you and your hands are out of the way, it will probably go for a trouser or coat corner instead - nowhere else can really be comfortably bitten. Barking is not necessarily a sign of aggression - it can indicate playfulness too. You have to look at the dog's other body language to work that out.

Most likely, it will approach and sniff you. When it's this close, you'll be able to see it more clearly, generally speaking a wagging tail means a dog that is happy and comfortable with you, a low, stiff tail means a dog that is still on patrol/aggression mode, and a tail curled beneath the dog's body indicates fear. In the latter two cases, there's a chance you might get bitten. In the former, you almost certainly won't unless you injure the dog in some way. You can tell a lot about a dog's personality by looking at the face and eyes though, much as you can with people. I don't know how naturally it comes to most people, but when I see a dog's face I can suss-out its disposition pretty much instantaneously and I think most people with experience of owning dogs would say the same.

If you want to make friends and the dog's tail is wagging, present one of your hands, palm facing upwards, tilted towards the dog's face. I find this is a bit like a handshake for a dog. It's symbolic of openness, but you also want to seem confident and assertive - a lot of the dynamics in human-canine relationships are about confidence. they are pack animals and they need to know that you 'outrank' them. Don't shove your hand into the dog's face - that's a surefire way to lose a finger, just hold your hand outwards at a level the dog can comfortably sniff. They will almost certainly smell your hand straight away. It's one of the small areas of skin on the body that we almost always have exposed as humans, and they will get a clearer picture of you from your sweat odour on your hand than they will from sniffing around your legs and feet. If the sniffs are short, enthusiastic and 'rapid-fire' that's a good sign. If they are long and deep the dog has probably gone back into patrol mode and you should be cautious, but this isn't very likely.

When the dog has a good impression of you from your scent, and assuming that its tail is still wagging, it could want a stroke. Avoid the face generally. Poking a dog in the eye by mistake is a bad idea, and dogs are often sensitive about their mouth and ear regions, particularly with strangers. The back of the neck is almost invariably a safer bet. Relax your arm so the dog can feel the weight of your hand (but don't apply pressure) and stroke gently along the grain of the dog's fur, lifting the hand to repeat. Don't rub a dog's fur up the wrong way unless you know it. Compare stroking your own head with and against the grain of your hair. The former is a lot less perturbing, I'm sure you'll agree.

If you are a woman and you are menstruating or pregnant, you should be more cautious. Dogs can pick up on the particular scents women release at these times, and depending on the dog's gender and whether or not they are in heat, they can respond in a way that makes you uncomfortable. If a dog is tall enough and you are on your period, it will very likely try to sniff between your legs before anything else. It's embarrassing, but pushing an unfamiliar dog out of the way is a bad idea. A conscientious owner will notice that you are uncomfortable and do something about their dog.

If you're particularly unfortunate, you might meet a neurotic dog in which you trigger an aggressive impulse. My grandma's dog hates bald men with loose trousers. These impulses usually relate to previous abuse of the animal. Needless to say, you don't try and make friends with these dogs.

Generally speaking, pet ownership is a sign of compassion. I can't speak for everyone (and there are some idiotic dog owners out there who have absolutely no control over their pets) but we're mostly protective of our animals like people are of their children, and though we might not necessarily expect you to like them as much as we do, we certainly won't respond well to you trying to kick our dogs out of the way or other potentially hurtful behaviour. Try and be polite in your interactions with dog owners, and most of us will do our best to help and make you feel comfortable. We don't take dogs off leads to spite other pedestrians, and not all dog owners are confident enough about their dog's behaviour to let our dogs run off the lead, often because we worry that they will run away. But when we do let them off, it's usually exercise-related. A walk on a lead is a lot more of a formal, 'unnatural' situation for a dog than running free in a field or wood, and isn't as good exercise. Please try to bear that in mind.

Ultimately all dogs are just a few steps removed from wolves. Their behaviour can be unpredictable. It depends on the dog, and the owners tend to know their dogs best and only let them be around strangers if they don't expect there to be problems, but there's no way to guarantee that a dog will never bite anyone under any circumstances. It can help to know breeds. I had a greyhound, and they are the gentlest breed I know. Dogs that are considered dangerous often aren't innately that way though. Aggressive dogs are often that way because they ended up with a bastard who treats them horribly.

When you yourself go to the gym, you're already healthy and are going to live a long and happy life. Obese people are not, and the gym is essentially a treatment for it.

In the long term the NHS will be saving money by paying for incentive programmes now and not paying for triple heart bypasses in the future. The cash incentive system is just a measure of conditioning, since that's pretty easy to do. The same would not happen if they subsidised your 4 days of strength training.

To say they're entitled to free gym time is misrepresentation, I think. The gym time isn't free until they've proved that weight loss has happened and is sustainable, if I'd read this rightly (though by the tag and the downvotes I guess this article wasn't trustworthy). It may be better to say that they get free gym time if it's been shown to be an effective treatment for them, since obesity is most definitely an illness, even if a self-caused one.

true,Lordzoot,eng-yorkshire,Leeds,"&gt;It would be the publicans free choice as to whether it was a smoking or non-smoking pub.

Which is exactly what the government did not want to happen, because this would create a scenario where all pubs would, likely, remain smoking pubs to maintain the status quo.

&gt;My philosophy revolves around not forcing people to do what they want if they're not harming anyone in the process. No pub would be forced to provide for smokers if it didn't want to but likewise no pub would be forced to stop people freely choosing to smoke in their establishment.

This is harming people in the process. It harms staff who do not smoke and it harms all individuals who do not have access to a non-smoking pub (and most pubs would not choose to become non-smoking). It would be a silly law.

&gt;This is the problem, you say something works when it satisfies your selfish desires. It doesn't matter who it doesn't work well for as long as you're happy.

Look at it this way. You can still smoke - you just have to do it in the beer garden. In a small village with two pubs, under your law, both would likely remaining smoking pubs. I, as a non-smoker, then find myself in a scenario where I don't have access to a non-smoking pub, even though, under the law, this is something that the government wants to encourage. Equally, Jessica, the 18 year old bar maid, who does not smoke, is forced to breath in fumes all day.

Which of these scenarios is the least just? 

Oh and, by the way, who pays for your treatment when you suffer the repercussions of your habit? Is it the NHS, funded by all tax payers, or would you be happy proposing a system whereby you have to pay for private treatment?

Then you'd have to be content with lowering taxes on cigarettes. I don't smoke myself but if I did I would roughly be contributing £4 in tax on a £5 pack of cigarettes. The justification of the high tax is the cost to society, and of course medical costs make up much of that.  

Personally I don't want a privatised NHS. I think we've got a proud tradition of socialised healthcare here in the UK that has served us well and continues to do so.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"I agree that there is some statistical manipulation which has been used to make this argument previously, looking at a (massive) Scottish deficit without comparing it to the existing (massive) British deficit. But this post also relies on some manipulation of the facts. The real issue is about the budgetary over-reliance on oil revenue, which has [fluctuated hugely over the last forty years](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/15756/4579-og-revenue-table.pdf). Revenues initially peaked at £12bn in the mid eighties, then fell to £1bn seven years later. Even in the last five years, in the midst of an oil boom, the fluctuations have been enormous: from £7.4bn, £13bn,  £6.6bn, £8.9bn to £11.2bn. 

This raises two points, first an element of cherry picking- the figures presented rely on the £11.2bn figure, from 2011/12, which is not only a recent peak, but the fourth highest annual oil revenue in history. Secondly that managing this extent of fluctuation would require some superb political leadership. For instance, the financial crisis occurred in late 2008, that year the oil revenues were £13bn, and the next year they fell by half, which would have represented a 10% fall in Scottish revenues, occurring on top of a 5% loss of GDP, and the need to bail out Scottish banks. The result would surely have been catastrophic. 

The only way around this problem is to develop a sovereign investment fund, as with Norway, so that the state runs on non-oil revenue, and the extra is invested over the long term. IIRC, Norway has an attitude that oil revenue belongs to future generations as much as to them, which precludes spending the money now on financing deficit spending. In order to get to that stage in Scotland, there would have to be severe cuts in public sector expenditure.

Going back to the need for superb political leadership in the face of these fluctuations, I'm not convinced Scottish politicians are any better than British politicians in general, who have not exactly covered themselves in glory. For instance, Alex Salmond was if anything even more pro finance than Blair or Brown, before the crisis. In 2007 he said: *""We are pledging a light-touch regulation suitable to a Scottish financial sector with its outstanding reputation for probity, as opposed to one like that in the UK, which absorbs huge amounts of management time in 'gold-plated' regulation.""* Around the same time he was encouraging RBS to take over ABN Amro. It seems pretty clear that the SNP would if anything have plunged even more into the teeth of the crisis.

Major on the other hand, became PM due to the fact even the post-thatcher conservative party riddled with infighting was able to get behind him.

Wilson still had his suspicions, however these was not proved to be correct until after his once brilliant mind had been effected to dementia. Wilson died without the knowledge that he was in fact correct in his assumptions. A little sad tale.

I don't think so. And even if they do, in Australia companies are [still allowed to use anti-counterfeit markings on the packs](http://www.cancervic.org.au/plainfacts/browse.asp?ContainerID=plainfacts-myths).

BAT put forward the argument [""The plainer the pack, the simpler it is to counterfeit""](http://www.bat.com/group/sites/uk__3mnfen.nsf/vwPagesWebLive/DO7J7DCZ) before the Australian legislation was introduced. However, the Australian designs are not plainer than the branded packaging, because they have photographs on them, which the branded packaging did not. Most branded cigarettes just have a logo, so you could argue the branded pack is actually plainer than the ""plain"" packaging.

BAT also quoted a former Assistant Chief Constable of Northern Ireland saying [""Instead of 200 different designs of packs to copy, there would be just one...""](http://www.bat.com/group/sites/uk__3mnfen.nsf/vwPagesWebLive/DO7J7DCZ)

This is not a logical argument, since a criminal organisation does not have to reproduce *every* design of cigarette packet in order to create counterfeit cigarettes. They only really *have* to reproduce one!

This is also an illogical argument.

I don't deem an unintelligent choice by your standards an indicator of the overall intelligence or lack of judgement of an individual, perfectly intelligent people constantly willfully do things that may cause them long term harm.  

I also wouldn't say having an age restriction is because children are too stupid to judge whether they should smoke or not, the issue is whether they are informed enough to make that choice. Society is saying at a certain age it deems you informed and responsible enough to vote, smoke, go to war etc. It's not about intelligence.

Finally I wouldn't even agree intelligence (beyond a certain point) is a basis for restricting the choices of people to do things. I don't like the idea of a select, supposedly intelligent group of people deciding what is good for the supposedly unintelligent. Even relatively stupid people should have the freedom of choice as everyone else.

You could say much the same about ambulance staff, firefighters, Train Drivers, to an extent bus drivers and many others. 

You have the right to defend yourself. You seem rather ignorant of the law. The common law says ""A person, acting in defence of himself or another may use such force as is reasonable and neccessary in the circumstances and also may use such force to prevent a breach of the peace."" Section 3 of the criminal law act again outlines any person powers to use force to conduct a citizen's arrest or prevent crime. There is further legislation which lays out where a citizen may use force to help a constable and should they be assaulted whilst rendering such assistance then the party that assaulted of them will be guilty of assaulting a person assisting a constable which is treated the same as assaulting a police officer. The only bit of use of force legislation which police have is section 117 of the Police and criminal evidence act which relates to being able to use force to do certain things which PACE allows and for which a member of the public has no real use. When was the last time you had to use force to obtain fingerprints?

Smoking is a habit, having children is ensuring the continuation of your bloodline, family and the human race - I'm not sure they really compare.

The shark came around the next day with a video of him beating another man into a coma. He told my client that if he missed a payment, he will be in the next video. Another client had his repayments doubled every time he missed one. Another told me a friend of theirs' daughter was raped by a loan shark when the friend missed a payment. To be frank; anyone saying they're ""just like loan sharks"" doesn't have a clue what they're talking about. Payday loans have to follow the Consumer Credit Act or they lose their licence. Loan sharks work through fear.

* In my career, on behalf of my clients, I had to negotiate with banks, building societies, credit card companies and collection companies. By far, payday lenders were the most accommodating of them all. People don't like hearing that for some reason, but they would always try and accommodate reduced payments (if I could demonstrate a need for it) and freeze interest. Lloyds in comparison..... just utterly useless and non empathetic.

* And finally.... the APR. It amazes me when I ask people what APR stands for, how many of them don't have a clue. It's *Annual Percentage Rate*, and the clue is in the *Annual* part. Therefore it's not a reasonable figure to use on a week-long loan. 

Let me give you an example:

A mate wants to borrow £20 for a week. You agree, on the basis that he pays you back and buys you a pint (£3) when he does. He agrees. A week later, he pays you the £20 and buys you the £3 pint to say thanks.

Pretty much everyone would agree that £3 on £20 over a week is perfectly reasonable. Which is interesting, considering that it's around 770% APR!!!

Why is it so high? Because APR is an *annual* rate, and it's being used on a loan that is only for a week! It totally distorts the figure, and blows it out of proportion compared to, say, a mortgage which has a lifespan of 25 *years*.

So yes, they should be regulated. They should be made to be as accommodating to those who struggle (but they do this by and large at the minute), they should have a restriction on the charge if it rolls over too much. But banning them will have the same effect banning alcohol did in the 20's in America.",0,1362582578,null,0,false,0,c8qrwyl,t3_19ru62,t1_c8qrwyl,t3_19ru62,null,1431500348,26,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,26

Do you accept there is a difference in potential harm to you being in a confined area with smokers for some time and temporarily walking past someone on the street? Are you seriously so sensitive you feel it's acceptable to stop someone smoking in the street because the threat to your health is so great?

&gt;Driving a car on the other hand is typically transport and serves a greater purpose.

So it's ok to cause harm as long as you decide a greater purpose justifies it? 

Banning smoking outside is ok because the enjoyment of those that do it does not outweigh the significant harm done to you when you occasionally walk past them but driving shouldn't be banned because although the toxic substances you're exposed to are much greater the overall benefit of cars outweighs that?

The question is about morality and is academic and logical. I am not discussing a particular legal system, the UK or otherwise. If your point is that heroin is illegal in the UK and smoking is not, then we agree.

Originally you said:

&gt;My argument is that if someone chooses to smoke then it's their business.

and you also said

&gt;So? People shouldnt have a choice over how they live their own lives?

If I understand correctly, at these points, your argument is one of morality because 'should' expresses conditionality, thus clearly enters a discussion not only about the current state of the UK legal system but about what we should and shouldn't allow.

Forgive me again if I haven't understood but, the pivitol premise to your argument is that anyone can choose to do what they wish, because it's ""their business"" and saying people ""should have a choice over how they live their own lives.""

If we take that argument to its logical conclusion, all things that do harm to oneself are morally acceptable on the basis of personal choice. It's also someone else's business, not yours, if they wish to do heroin, after all.

true,erowidtrance,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;Which is exactly what the government did not want to happen, because this would create a scenario where all pubs would, likely, remain smoking pubs to maintain the status quo.

Explain what's wrong with that? If you can create a compromise where both smokers and non-smokers can go to a pub and not be negatively effected by each other what is the problem?

&gt;It harms staff who do not smoke

How would it harm staff if they have a choice whether to go into the smoking rooms or not? Are you harming vegetarians who on moral grounds choose not to work in a butchers?

&gt; it harms all individuals who do not have access to a non-smoking pub

Where did I say there would be pubs that are exclusively smoking? If pubs choose to allow smokers they would have areas for both smokers and no smokers, who is harmed there?

&gt;I, as a non-smoker, then find myself in a scenario where I don't have access to a non-smoking pub

To reiterate pubs that wanted smokers would have to accommodate everyone. 

&gt;Oh and, by the way, who pays for your treatment when you suffer the repercussions of your habit? 

Smokers do through massive taxation. Who pays for alcoholics who get treated on the NHS, who pays for anyone who suffers injury as a result of their choices? 

Are you advocating for anyone who may have contributed to their illnesses to be exempt from NHS care whether they've payed their taxes or not?

&gt; If we don't plan to enforce a law, we should not make it law. All it does is give more powers to people to abuse them.

I'm truly glad you can see this point - it's probably the crux of my entire point here. As you say you could easily generate revenue with random ""crack-down"" campaigns. 

In fact.. I think that answers itself. If there's ever doubt that a law is working as it ought to - you run a brief, intensive crackdown campaign and generate some good revenue / arrests in the doing so - then you can report on how many people you caught during that campaign and how it's right to have those laws...

Taking it to the logical extreme, on the whole I am in favour of decriminalising drug use. I do think it's a matter of personal choice - and yes, I am aware that there are knock-on effects from that but there are also knock-on effects from the use of alcohol. 

I think there's an argument for helping to prevent a fondness for something developing into an addiction, and I think the law should be an absolute last resort.

true,Lordzoot,eng-yorkshire,Leeds,"&gt;Where did I say there would be pubs that are exclusively smoking? If pubs choose to allow smokers they would have areas for both smokers and no smokers, who is harmed there?

Then who legislates. How much room is non-smoking? How much is smoking? What about one room pubs? Is a broom cupboard a suitable non-smoking area if it has a chair in it?

&gt;Smokers do through massive taxation.

They pay taxes, yes, but the treatment to cure cancer is crazily expensive and puts a strain on our medical services at a time when they're already stretched. Additionally, the money received through taxes, whilst significant at, I understand, around £8 billion a year is money which is not being spent elsewhere in the economy, so the picture is decidedly more complex than just 'smokers pay for it'.

&gt;Who pays for alcoholics who get treated on the NHS.

Currently, we all do. I would not be adverse to the idea of changing this either though. We have a health care system that can barely cope. If a person is abusing their own body to such an extent they require significant medical treatment for that abuse, then one could argue that it is extremely selfish to the rest of society. These people become net takers.

&gt;who pays for anyone who suffers injury as a result of their choices?

Again, currently, we do. But the government could decide what it chooses to pay for the treatment of. That's the prerogative of the state.

&gt;Are you advocating for anyone who may have contributed to their illnesses to be exempt from NHS care whether they've payed their taxes or not?

Not exempt from NHS care, no. It would depend on that person's ability to pay etc. It's important to note that you do not pay your taxes for the right to smoke. You may be taxed by the government for smoking but, in truth, this is an arbitrary tax, just like VAT is. 

We face a crisis point, however, in our ability to deliver public services. Something has to give. If we want a high quality standard of health care, we either have to a) all pay more tax (which I'm not against), or b) revise how we administer health care.

Whilst you seem to see this as a brutal method, it's not actually much different to other policies we have in place. You pay for prescription pills from the doctors if you can afford them and when you get old and go in to care, the money for that care is initially deducted from your own savings before the state pays.

If you make a choice to do something that the state believes is unhealthy, it doesn't seem that unreasonable to me that before you ask the state to cover the costs of your health care, you front up the money first.

Consider this; say 50% of defence spending ended up in Scotland, and 50% across the rest of the UK (that's a big chunk spread across ~10% of UK's population, but its exaggerated to illustrate the point).
 
Now say you cut the defence budget by 10%. That's going to make a significantly higher impact on defence spending per-capita in Scotland, simply because the spending is already so much higher then else ware.
 
Right now we're having to make a decision on which of our four shipyards to close; in all likelihood it will be Portsmouth, with all of the UK's naval shipbuilding henceforth done in Scotland. If Scotland becomes independent the opposite will likely happen; two of the bases there would close, and the UK’s shipbuilding would be re-located south of the border, or to Belfast.

The SNP has often suggested it would follow a defence policy similar to that of Norway or Sweden, which would preclude defence expenditure high enough to support the jobs and multiple shipyards Scotland currently operates. Independence would likely mean an end to shipbuilding on the Clyde.

They *look* high when you compare it to a loan of much higher value and over many hundreds of times the timescale, but if we do that we're comparing apples and oranges.

As I said in my analogy, 770% APR seems colossally high, but it's only £3 on £20.

The best thing to do is look at the real-time cost of a loan (£3 on £20) instead of the APR (770%). If it's £100 over 2 weeks, and the fee is £30, then you have a more reasonable comparison. From the other side of the fence, I've seen mortgages that are only 4-5%, but the real-time cost of the loan is double the principle sum i.e. £200k principle and £200k interest, because it's over 25-40 years. That sounds preposterously expensive, but it's only 4-5% APR! APR is only useful when comparing like-for-like loans, not totally different arrangements and timescales.

And saying ""as soon as it's paid back it is lent out to someone else"" misses the point. They're individual transactions, and are thus treated individually.

Remember that their market are those who the ""normal"" prime lenders won't touch with a barge pole. They have a much higher default rate than normal bank loan customers, so that takes a huge chunk of the return.

A few things to consider: first, it costs money to provide a loan. There are checks, there are bank fees, there are admin costs. A £10,000 loan over 5 years can absorb this without even noticing, but a week loan of £100 will spend a huge amount on fees relative to the loan. The price of the loan will therefore reflect this. Secondly, collecting unpaid debt is very expensive. Not only are the collection activities very personnel-heavy, there's also the opportunity cost of those missed payments. There's also the fact that unpaid debt sold on (most creditors will sell bad debt to a collection agency instead of dealing with it themselves) is sold for pennies to the pound. When I used to work in debt management, I would sometimes hear of debt being sold for 7p in the pound, which is a huge cost to the lender. This must also be factored in.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"An acquaintance of mine used to be (or still is?) very high up in European marketing for Phillip Morris.  I haven't seen him for a few years, but he told me they knew it was coming as a matter of certainty.  The government gave them (I think) 5 years warning, and this was about 4 years ago if memory serves.

As he explained to me, the reason why it's potentially so damaging to the cigarette companies (and good for the health of the nation) is because branding is the main thing (by quite a long way) that differentiates cigarettes.  Their market research showed that people will smoke pretty much any cigarette and say it's lovely (for a smoker's definition of ""lovely"") as long as it comes in the box of their favourite brand and is otherwise indistinguishable from it.  Or conversely, you can put a smoker's usual brand of cigarette is a different box and suddenly it doesn't taste so nice.

Without the feeling of ""belonging to a club"" that comes with strong brand association, smokers generally reported being less satisfied with their cigarettes.  Or to put it bluntly, when you take away the flashy packet, they're more likely to realise that cigarettes are cancer sticks that smell like shit and make you cough (no offence to smokers - I am one).

Incidentally, I think this is highly questionable:

&gt; Exchange thinktank has estimated it costs society £14bn.

The most recent figures I saw (about a year ago) said the NHS spends around £7 billion a year on treating smokers but the government makes about £14 billion in taxing tobacco.  Smokers also die younger (statistically speaking) so are less of a burden in old age.  Of course, the NHS isn't the only cost to society, but the smokers are already £7bn in credit, so that's £21bn of extra costs that need to be accounted for to reach the figure quoted above.

For the record, I'm all in favour of the move - smoking's bad m'kay and we shouldn't encourage/allow companies to target people via advertising, branding, etc., which might encourage them to start. Especially children. However I believe everyone should have the right to smoke tobacco, drink alcohol and take ""illegal"" drugs if they so choose.

Not many of the facts add up, their policies are contradicting (science says legalise drugs so we'll do that, but science says global warming is occurring but we don't buy that). The idea that we hand people over to the USA and Europe without evidence isn't true, certain level of evidence is required and we get criminals back too. 

I think the worst thing is ""if it means a frostier relationship with the US or getting kicked our the EU so be it"". What the fuck was the person on when they wrote that.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; You could say much the same about ambulance staff, firefighters, Train Drivers, to an extent bus drivers and many others. 

How are any of them monopolies?

There is certainly an argument that ambulance and fire staff have a few monopoly powers; but there is nothing stopping a private purchaser buying fire engines and ambulances and then hiring appropriately qualified people to run them.  No one does that of course, because there is little point in a country where they are provided from taxation.

But busses and trains?  They're already run by multiple private companies.  Perhaps you are limiting your thinking to the simultaneous hell-hole and paradise of public transport that is London?

The right to defend myself is not the same as having the same powers as the police.  If the police need those powers (as they would presumably claim), then anyone replacing them would need those powers; but no one who might replace them when they go on strike is legally entitled to those powers.

That would be the office of constable. The office of constable is what makes us unique. It makes us crown servants instead of employees. Its what makes up our pay and conditions. Here's the thing, you're a bit stuck because in a modern world, you need a police force. G4S or Serco could do the same if they had the office of constable right? Well not really. Why? They're a private company, they're in the business of making money. Where is the money in policing? There isn't any, its all at cost to the tax payer. A private company would need to be paid. So by what parameters do you pay them? Y amount for an arrest, X amount for a traffic ticket and so on. Does that not simply give them an incentive to hand out as many as possible, for these imaginary constables there would be no such thing as discretion. Policing is and must remain impartial. That can't happen with a private company so it has to be sate funded. Police officers aren't asking for a lot from the government. The then HMIC Sir Dennis O'connor said you could cut 12% off the policing budget and that would be about all you could cut. So the government plowed ahead and cut 20%. What we're saying in policing is we want to be able to give the public what they deserve. But under Winsor morale has dropped, when the new, lower paid recruits come in it won't get any better, with the rest of the cuts, we don't have the tools or the officer numbers we need. We are being hamstrung. We all just want to do what we signed up to do and continue to provide protection to the public.

I think if there were a strike then it would be like a fire brigade strike, we'll go to stuff which is an emergency, but nothing else.

Another example... Walking up to a fat guy in McDonalds and telling him that Big Mac large meal is going to make him fat.

Its not so much that its annoying you telling people that smoking is bad for them, you may think its a nice thing that you're concerned about their well being but smokers see it a different way. Its the fact that you are by far, not the first person to say exactly the same thing that day it just gets tiring hearing the same things over and over again.

It gets to the point where you just want to tell them that you're an adult and capable of making your own decisions.

true,PeelianPleb,null,null,"Ambulance and fire-fighters hold a monopoly for the reason you say they don't. There are very few people who can actually do what they do and wouldn't, if they went on strike be able to provide sufficient cover for them. 

I'll tell you a story about the last time LFB (London Fire Brigade) went on strike, what a couple of years ao. They don't own their own fire appliances, they are owned (or were) by a company called AssetCo. That means that the firefighters have to hand control of the appliances to AssetCo during a strike. AssetCo provided ""trained firefighters"" who couldn't actually fill the appliances up, fight fires, enter burning buildings and simply didn't have the experience to fulfil the role of a real firefighter. In short they were about as much use as a chocolate teapot. Similarly with the ambulance service, you can't have a bunch of green people turn up, with no ability and expect them to be able to run an efficient service. 

Train drivers have a monopoly because they are among only a relative few who are qualified to move several hundred tons of machinery and thousands of people on the railway. If they go on strike no one can take over from them. No one else can drive the train. Now yes, there are different companies but most drivers belong to the same union, ASLEF, ASLEF can ballot its members to all strike simultaneously across many different companies. Likewise to drive a bus you need a Category D (PSV) driving licence. Most people do not have one, and most bus drivers belong to the RMT union. So now you're going down the same line. The private companies don't have a monopoly as such but the workers do have a similar monopoly. 

""

The right to defend myself is not the same as having the same powers as the police. If the police need those powers (as they would presumably claim), then anyone replacing them would need those powers; but no one who might replace them when they go on strike is legally entitled to those powers."" 

Indeed but then for good reason. Neither does practising on a resussie Anne a paramedic make. Its about experience and that gives paramedics their monopoly. If you gave someone who had been on a crash policing course a warrant card then had them come in to do policing en masse with the full powers and privileges of constable then they'd be a nightmare because none of them would have suitable experience. In fact there is legislation which allows a whole town to be sworn in as special constables for a day that would give them the full power and privilege of constable.

 - in a modern world, you need a police force.
 - Where is the money in policing? There isn't any

Where there is a need, there is money.  At present the money for a police force is taken from me by force.  I am, according to you, to be happy about that because I am receiving a service that I need.  If that is true, then why would I not happily pay a private provider that same money?

If I have insurance, for example, then if my house is broken into the insurance company has to cough up the cash.  Would it not be in their interest to pay someone to recover my property/catch criminals?  In fact, don't the police represent a massive public subsidy to insurance companies?

&gt; So by what parameters do you pay them? Y amount for an arrest, X amount for a traffic ticket and so on.

I don't know.  On past history though, the market is very good at pricing.

&gt; Does that not simply give them an incentive to hand out as many as possible, for these imaginary constables there would be no such thing as discretion.

Except since they have no more power than anyone else, they would be forced to use civil courts, with matching costs, to settle disputes (like ""you were speeding on this road in contravention of the contract you signed saying you wouldn't"").  It would cost them more to issue bogus tickets as the civil court would simply award in favour of the defendent.

&gt; Policing is and must remain impartial. That can't happen with a private company so it has to be sate funded. Police officers aren't asking for a lot from the government.

Don't get me wrong.  While I do have (strange) ideas about private policing; I don't in any way think that they are ever likely to happen.  I'm very supportive of the police force, and wish them no ill.  What they are asking is (likely, I haven't looked) very reasonable.  That doesn't change the fact that the police are a monopoly provider of an essential service.  When police officers sign up, they do so knowing that striking is not allowed for them.  It simply is not possible to allow police officers to legally strike.

---

That being said, and changing tack completely, the government cuts to the police force are, as they are in all other departments, focused in completely the wrong place -- the front line.  The problem is that each department wants it that way for two reasons: (1) they need to show that the cuts are painful, and cutting a load of desk riders wouldn't even be noticed by the public (2) it is the desk riders who decide where the cuts fall, and turkeys do not vote for christmas.

I feel for the police, and do not want them to have these cuts, but the blind shouting about absolute budget sizes is not the way to get sympathy.  Start telling and showing the public that the cuts are falling on beat police officers, who are the ones who turn up when we call, when at the same time not one 9-5 officer (and I use the word ""officer"" quite loosely) is being cut.

The inspector gadget blog is superb at this.  Ably demonstrating that the police force we want makes up about 20% of the cost.  I would rather cut the 80% who are not doing anything that the public wants, and triple the pay/numbers of the 20%.",0,1362597354,null,0,false,0,c8qwlra,t3_19qo3k,t1_c8qwlra,t1_c8qvy84,null,1431502623,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

That is not a monopoly by any definition.

That is simply a scarcity of resource.  Problems like that solve themselves with the price mechanism in a free market.

Monopolies of this sort are state-granted.  It is the law that makes it impossible to, for example, start a competing police force and start hiring away the top officers from the existing police force by paying them more money.

If anything, police officers should be in favour.  Their skills are rare and in a free market would be far more likely to command the pay they would like.  You have to be able to say why plastic surgeons are paid more in the private sector than oncologists in the public sector before you can say that the police wouldn't get higher pay away from the government.

Seriously are you incredibly fucking stupid or do you live off the grid preparing for the apocalypse, I just cannot fathom being so mind numbingly ignorant as to try and engage in an argument with an adult on this matter.

What is it you are suggesting, that it is a conspiracy theory? that is was just an administrative oversight, are you a member of staff there and in denial. 

Even if you had been abroad doing charity work in the developing world it has been a long running saga with MPs grilling the chief executive of the NHS in a committee. Why not just google it, is your internet rationed? did you get confused and eat your fingers whilst having lunch, sometime when i am tired in the mornings i have put my milk in the glass and the orange juice in my cereal, is it like that?

Why why why do people keep asking for proof of well known events, seriously what kind of cunt would ask for sources (No daily mail pls only guardian) of the olympics, I never actually went there but the amount of news coverage  would suggest to me it occurred barring a huge conspiracy.

b) better ranges. I need to be able to drive 2-300 miles on one charge, and be able to fill up with in at most a few hours. Also, at the moment a small petrol station has maybe 6 pumps for cars - imagine how many we'd need if cars took a few hours each to charge - there would be fields full of cars, all charging up.

c) more/better charging stations. I can guarantee finding a petrol station anywhere near a major town, or a big  tesco store etc anywhere in the UK - even in remote parts of scotland.

true,TheSunsArchitect,lfc68,,"Completely disagree with his comment on Pepe. He was flawless against Wigan, and he is the exact sort of keeper we need for the ""playing from the back"" style. 

As far as the defense goes, The only problems, to me, are that Skrtel has been out of form (apparently, we haven't seen him for weeks) and that Carra is retiring. Apart from a couple of slip ups a few weeks ago, Agger has been solid as ever, and is great with his feet, good going forward, very good passer, once again precisely what is needed for this style. 

It goes without saying the importance of our two fullbacks, Johnson does his duty going forward and in defense, especially after criticism earlier in his career that he was useless at the back. And Enrique, after becoming out of favour early in the season is becoming the player he was always meant to be, absolutely solid at the back, great link up play, and contributes with a goal here and there too. 

What this team needs and has always needed, is time, and this season has been the foundation for that. 

Developing players in a style like this does not happen over night, and recently we have seen it coming into full effect, with big wins, and solid performances against the top teams. 

Rodgers has a plan, and he knows what he needs to do. Spending big on players is risky, especially when you're bargaining with the further development of up and coming young players. 

Let's stay patient, and faithful to the cause.

In Rodgers we trust.
