I think that they would have preferred a backup striker other than Bendtner  and a young CB to develop but that is the difference between a great window and a good window. ",0,1378335491,null,0,false,0,cc1unzw,t3_1lqacp,t1_cc1unzw,t1_cc1qhm3,null,1429588396,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Only downside was hearing the 'Always the victims' and 'Murderers' chants from the United fans. I'd heard them on the television before but it really made me angry in person. I was seated in the main stand fairly close to them so I could easily make out all their chants. 

I'm also fairly sure some Liverpool fans were doing aeroplane gestures, which was really unfortunate. 

It's hard to appreciate how much these teams hate each other until you're at the game. It was an atmosphere nothing like any of the sports in my country (Australia) and you could really feel the tension. Definitely a day I'll never forget.

Only took a couple of photos because I didn't want to look like a twat and turn the game into a photo shoot, here they are if anyone is interested:

I don't think I can get scoreboards of games I wasn't in I can ask the other teams to post them tomorrow. I'll tell you what I remember;

Dannyds team beat the randoms in game one pretty convincingly. Was kind of a stomp. The random team was very strange, they picked SF, he took necromastery at 1/3/5 then literally just held his skill points till level 6 when he put 3 in raze. Was really weird. Dannys team stomped that one
Game 2 was a bit more even, they aggro trilaned tiny+2 supports I can't remember vs bounty hunter but had no detection. After a few minutes the supports rotated to bot and the tiny soloed vs bh. Tiny actually got pretty farmed and despite some big lothars solo kills they eventually lost, they were actually ahead for a bit but couldn't keep it up.

Obviously, it will be Arsenal's payday if that happens since he has such a long contract.  Theoretically, Levy was under no pressure to sell until Bale himself wanted out.

Bale leaving is a lot like when RVP left, except Bale seemed much more professional about it.  Arsenal got the raw end of the deal with that.  But a more balanced team is more important.  It hurts personally because it was him that got me into Spurs back in 2010, but oh well.

Finally, yeah... I agree that the crucial part of our squad is the youth.  Spurs may get 5th or 6th this season (personally, I think it will be Chelsea, City, Arse/Spurs in 3rd or 4th.  I'm not sure Moyes is up to the task and I don't think Liverpool's form will continue).  We have A LOT of work to do to get these players up to speed in the PL and working together properly.

I didn't see much of the early game of BCE vs Dead Stack. Dread stack had Batrider, TA, Naix, Nyx and Ench. BCE had Gyro, Puck, Venge, Clockwork and I forgot the last one. By the time I started watching it was like 40-50 minutes and the gyro was super farmed while ta and naix were farmed but not as much. The gyro had butterfly and the naix and ta didn't have mkbs, in the fights I saw the batrider would try to blink ult gyro, they'd go on gyro then he'd just get swapped out and bkb while clockwork held out the naix and ta from properly focusing the gyro and gyro just dropped everyone. I spoke to them later and they said that they farmed a quick mek on ench then went to push but made some mistakes in the fight or something and lost the fight hard and from there I guess it all went downhill.
I can't remember all the picks of game 2 but bce had invoker mid and a weaver short trilane with nyx and timbersaw off lane, dread stack had a gyro short trilane with a naga+wisp and puck mid. Can't remember all heroes. The invoker stomped mid, he got ganged once and died to it but out csed the puck by like 2x, can't remember too much about the game but dread stack was definitely ahead for a good portion of the game then they lost a few fights and the weaver did far too much damage.

I just hope that you're clinching it from United and Arsenal have 3rd secured.  Chelsea &amp; City look pretty good for 1st and 2nd though, I agree.  I'm sure a United supporter would beg to differ if he saw our conversation, but I just don't see United being ahead of the rest.  They have an ageing team in crucial positions, Fellaini doesn't exactly bring a creative spark to their midfield in comparison with who Arsenal, Spurs, City  &amp; Chelsea have brought in.  I think they're one semi-serious injury to RVP away from crashing out of the top 4.",0,1378336488,null,0,false,0,cc1v019,t3_1lqmuo,t1_cc1v019,t1_cc1uptj,null,1429588239,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

I think you'll get Europa again this year but if you can hold on to the kids you'll be a true top 4 contender in a few years. 

For us, our depth is acceptable and Ozil is an amazing player. For me he is a statement of intent for us and will help us retain our talent and attract other true top talent like ozil. Its dumb to say who had the better window because we went about two different things. Spurs added loads of slight upgrades and filled out the squad, Arsenal added to to our top end output. Both good windows.

To be honest my thoughts on you getting CL anytime soon are these: you will need one of the top four to regress. Unless you inject more cash to pull in real big boys I don't see you climbing above the big 4. Arsenal are still the most attractive target to displace though.

I agree with you for the most part.  Ozil is a phenomenal buy.  Although, I will say only this, he's a creator rather than finisher, and so relies on good players to cap off his passes.  Giroud looks like a man reborn at the start of this season, but you guys do lack in depth up front, especially for challenging on multiple fronts this year.  Injuries or loss of form may curtail Ozil's effectiveness somewhat.

I'm excited about the signings we've made, but I don't fully expect us to live up to our potential this season.  I think next season - barring major injuries - we'll be better placed to make a clean run at the top 4, perhaps even top 3.

Possibly the greatest asset in your favour this season is that every other team challenging for top 4 honours has a manager either in their first or second season at the club!

true,LevitatingCheesecake,null,null,"Gerrard and Torres didn't play together that much in 08/09. Torres only got something like 14 goals in the league, in terms of goals it was his worst season under Rafa. We reached the summit because we had so many 'ordinary' players who were not only capable of scoring important goals (Kuyt, Yossi, even Carra got a late equalizer IIRC) but were in the form of their lives. And even when they failed we had the likes of Babel and Riera to chip in. We had a varied, multi-talented strikeforce supported by a midfield of Alonso-Mascherano-Gerrard and a solid defence. The Gerrard-Torres parnership was more effective in 07/08, but once their teammates (partuclarly Xabi, who had been dire for 3 years) got their arses in to gear, we became title contenders. 

Strength and depth wins you leagues. Amazing players like Torres and Gerrard can make the difference in the games against United and Chelsea, but you need someone like Kuyt to bundle in a scrappy winner on a freezing night against some team like Wigan when Gerrard and Torres are injured or having off-games.

That's why I'm excited by this squad: we've got lots of players capable of finding the net, we're not relying on one player anymore (that didn't go that well for us when it was only Suarez, before we got Coutinho and Sturridge). I'd say that we have better depth than the 08/09 team, once we add proven quality to that we'll be title contenders.

Because of the strength and depth we had, it took United, even with their attacking options of Berbatov, Tevez, Ronaldo and Rooney, (not to mention record-breaking defence) a couple of late goals by 17 year old Kiko Macheda to win the title.",0,1378343090,null,0,false,0,cc1x8nt,t3_1lqwrv,t1_cc1x8nt,t3_1lqwrv,null,1429587194,27,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,27

true,zakalwe_666,null,null,"I'm the first to admit I only need one bedroom, but when I moved in here I was working and didn't receive any benefits, so a second bedroom was a convenience for me - now it is just an added expense. As much as the local council have admitted I'm a priority case, there really is nothing they can do until a suitable flat becomes available.

Medically, I have primary progressive multiple schlerosis, an auto-immune disease which attacks and strips the myelin sheath from nerve fibres, preventing effective signal conduction (think of a bundle of electrical wires, some live, and some missing the insulating plastic). Because everything in your body has a nervous component, the range of possible symptoms is vast. For me the main one is muscular control; in very basic terms, signals from my brain to my limbs to co-ordinate movement don't always get through, and neither does the feedback that informs my brain where my limbs are spatially. Imagine you have been kneeling down too long and your legs have gone to sleep, now try getting up and walking - that's what I'm like 24/7. Other than my legs (numb up to my thighs) my left hand is numb, and I'm beginning to lose mobility in my left arm. My right arm is still ok so far. Other symptoms I have are a very weak bladder - I have to go to the toilet very frequently, with very little warning, so I do piss myself weekly. I'm always constipated because of failing peristalsis (the muscular motion of the intestine that pushes everything through) so get bloating and pain after about 4 days; I have a bowel movement once a week. Finally, there is extreme fatigue after only a few hours - not feeling tired, but being exhausted to the point of falling asleep anywhere. The most frustrating thing is people's perception of MS; the more common form is relapsing/remissive MS, where sufferers have periods of remission where they are symptom free, or their symptoms are greatly reduced. Such periods can last for months at a time. The people you see running marathons with MS have RRMS. 10% of sufferers have primary progressive MS - there are no periods of remission, symptoms are 24/7/52, and will only get worse. There are no drugs for PPMS as the MS drugs developed work by delaying the onset of a relapse and are effective during remission. I have PPMS. Sorry for the medical lesson.

With regards the stairs, I can go down them standing as I don't need to lift my feet to go down; it just takes a while and scares the shit out of me as I'm unsteady on my feet. Going back up I have to go up backwards on my arse. Needless to say I put my rubbish out in the middle of the night to prevent humiliation. I can shuffle about ok in my flat, and only fall a couple of times a week at the moment (laminate floors aid the shuffling). If I need to go anywhere (doctor, hospital, ATOS) I use 2 walking sticks, very slowly, with a lot of rest stops. A wheelchair has been suggested, but isn't practical at the moment - nowhere to store it downstairs, so the kids would steal it. I used one a few weeks ago for a funeral I had to attend, and it was exhausting work.

I'll spill the beans as you suggest. I could work in front of a computer for short periods of time (which is the governments view) but there is no realistic way I can commute to and from a work place without a carer helping me every time. And can you really see an employer even contemplating giving someone like me a job when they can get someone half my age (I'm 41) at less cost? I worked for 20 years and paid my NI and tax. I find myself living in a constant state of anxiety about what will happen next. I afford the bedroom tax only because I receive DLA, but I'm worried about the change to universal credit and PPI, and how I'm going to get through that changeover. I know that if ATOS ever deem me fit for work I would win an appeal, but an appeal can take many months, during which time I would receive no income at all, and bills would mount up. That's what I have the helium for - life is not worth existing like that. At the moment, I've been trying to save for when I eventually get a move. I don't smoke, drink, gamble, go on holiday, have a TV. I have the internet, that is my window on the world, and a prepay phone that I spend £10 on every 2-3 months. The government and a lot of the media (look at recent shows on BBC and Ch4 where they cherry-pick benefit claimants to bias the view) like to demonise people like me as work-shy scroungers living it large at the taxpayers expense. I was a taxpayer for 20 years, and still am - I pay tax on purchases! I don't live, I exist, that's it. I exist at the mercy of a government that would rather I died off. I'm surprised they aren't pushing for voluntary assisted euthanasia on the NHS, they could save a fortune because I guarantee a lot of people like me would take the option of a guaranteed pain free exit. I'm 41; I could live another 40 years. What the fuck have I got to look forward to in all that time apart from death?

true,johanspot,null,null,"&gt;They have 6 fit defenders right now. 3 of them are CBs. Remember us last year? How we needed 5 CBs just to struggle through? They have 3, and a RB that can play as a CB

Actually they have 2 CB's right now. Mertesacker and Koscielny. Past that it is Sagna sliding over and Jenkinson filling in. And I completely agree that Jenkinson isn't ready. The first 15 minutes I was sure he was going to cost Arsenal the game but it just never happened and he was mostly a non-issue after that. Time will tell whether the first 15 minutes or the last 75 are the real representation.

&gt;They also don't have a real DM. 

This I disagree with. Wenger doesn't want a pure DM to start because it kills the offense as tottenham found out on Sunday. They want a backup DM to come in with a 1 goal lead which Flamini fills perfectly at a reasonable cost. Arteta filled the role perfectly well last season and while covering for him with an injury isn't ideal he will be back soon.

&gt;Instead, they strengthened in a place they could have waited to strengthen in.

This is where we diverge. The team has been COUNTING ON Rosicky for the last 6 months at CAM and that was the single biggest starter that could be improved. the team had more success with Cazorla on the left. They needed an upgrade at CAM and they got the best in the world. 

&gt;It's papering over the cracks of their squad

I'm not sure how well this would work in practice exactly, but I was trying to figure out a way to maximize the talent on the field while also trying to take advantage of the flexibility of the squad. 

I see Yaya and Fernandino trading places between the more forward, box-to-box position, and the CDM position, when we have possession, and bot of them dropping back to cut out attacks and win balls when we don't. Whoever of the two was in the forward position would swap sides with the CAM as necessary, depending on who was doing what and where. If Silva were playing LAM, the CAM would probably be further to the right of Yaya/Fern, as he likes to play it inside a bit, if Jovetic were playing they'd be more likely to play on the left of Yaya/Fern, as he's a bit more comfortable out wide, but again, it's all situational, and the entire point is to be able to vary the formation based on the action on the field. 

Essentially what you're left with is a 4-2-3-1 in which one of the back two CM's is playing forward, with the 3 AM's/wingers which Yaya, Fernandinho, and Rodwell are all very capable of doing, very willing to do, and potentially very dangerous when doing it. It's actually pretty similar to what we already play.

You could also play with a second striker (Jovetic or Aguero) in the attacking midfield 3. Lots of options.",0,1378347558,null,0,false,0,cc1ysxy,t3_1lpf8r,t1_cc1ysxy,t3_1lpf8r,null,1429586466,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1

There are work related things I can do, but being realistic I'm not employable because of my limitations. As worthless as it makes me feel, I can see it from an employers point of view. I wouldn't employ me. My symptoms will also only get worse. I first noticed my feet going numb 6 years ago, and it progressed slowly, but I have got a lot worse over the last 18 months. The deterioration may reach a level and I don't get worse than I am now for many years, or I may be bed-bound and incontinent in 12 months time.

I'm on the third floor because I moved here before I was symptomatic and diagnosed. I felt fine and worked every day 8 years ago when I moved here. I'm still here now because there are no available one bedroom ground floor places, and I don't agree with evicting someone from their home just because they are mobile and I'm not. What does bug me is there are senior housing area's where the residents must be 65+. I'm too young to get accepted to such a place despite being less mobile than many of the current residents.

A doctor has seen ""what is in my legs"" - I have MS, my nerves are failing as a result of being attacked by my immune system. The reason for my symptoms is not in dispute. Regarding research and funding, MS is not a profitable disease. About 100k people in the UK have it, of those, about 10k have the type I have.

That's easier for the patient and cheaper for the health service, and that's money saved which can be spent on other areas of care.

I would guess that, for many years, eye tests have been subsidised by those customers choosing to buy designer frames and anti-glare lens upgrades.

This may need addressing as buying glasses online takes off. 

Opticians use to be required to offer a selection of glasses which are below a certain price point - covered completely by a NHS voucher. If you were very lucky, you'd find a pair of cheap glasses that suited you, but most of them were awful, and many people were prepared to pay extra.

I might guess opticians may no longer be able to continue functioning at current NHS rates, if everyone goes in there, gets a free eye test and then leaves the store to go buy their glasses online.

true,kopking08,null,null,"Dude how long have you been watching football? There's no way that formation would work for our team. First of all, if your even using the players you mentioned you'd be switching Agger and Sahko. Agger doesn't have the legs for LB. He's a CB through and through.

Aside from that I think our best defense is pretty difficult to call right now.

I'd say Agger is the only player I think who owns their spot. That said, perhaps Rodgers will use Agger at RCB and Sahko at LCB because Agger has more experience and he could adjust more quickly.

Who can really say yet though? I'm interested to see what we line up on the 16th.

But continuing on, I think our options in defense essentially allow us to line up any number of combinations, depending on who we field in our other outfield players.

Assuming our players are not injured, I expect against top 6 squads we'll start Johnson, Sahko, Agger, and Enrique. BUT I think there's a definite possibility Enrique could lose his spot against those teams and Sahko could play LB and Toure slot into CB. 

Overall we have so much strength in depth we can really field any number of defensive combinations. You could do Kelly, Toure, Agger, and Sahko for a force field back 4, which could enable us to play 4 pure attackers (meaning no Henderson at RW). The options go and go.

Anyways, I'm fairly surprised by your inclusion of Agger at LB. Sorry to question your football know how but that seems a very daft pick. I'd say the only failings of Enrique at LB have been in attack and we have no one who picks up that slack. Really, there are very few good defensive LBs in the world who are also capable going forward. Which is part of the reason I never understood the criticisms of Enrique. Nevertheless, Sakho would take LB before Agger.",0,1378358314,null,0,false,0,cc224vf,t3_1lqw0e,t1_cc224vf,t3_1lqw0e,null,1429584841,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

The real reason is because Unite had tried to play Labour at its own game, by encouraging members to join, and then asking them to vote for a specific Labour candidate.  This is something Labour already do (for example, at my local constituency, as a Labour member rather than a Unite member, I was told I should vote for a preferred candidate, and support a specific shortlist.)  

Of course, we can't have someone else playing the party at its own game, so Labour cried foul, claimed that the process was being manipulated, spoke to the press, made noise, claimed the unions are corrupt entities trying to shape British politics to their own designs, and handed all the information to the police suggesting criminal wrongdoing.

No criminal wrongdoing was evident, so they said they would have to change the links with Labour and the Unions, and brought up the fact that many unions have a political levy members contribute to, and a portion of this can go to Labour - and Labour said they no longer wanted it.  Oh, and many press articles pointed out that this money can amount to £3 a year, and members don't know they pay it - cue many members phoning up to drop out.

So, the unions have headed it off, and are stopping this payment anyway.  Not because they don't like Labour, but mainly because Labour asked them to - and quite frankly, I believe we can put this money to better use supporting our members.

If a road with crossing lights on is the turn-off on a round-about, then the lights will always show green until a pedestrian presses the crossing button.

Lights located on T junctions, or any other junction where vehicles have to yield for other vehicles crossing their way, the lights prioritise keeping traffic flowing on a timed loop. Having a predestrian press the crossing button causes the crossing indicator to change to green when both sets of traffic are halted by a red light. It might also extend the time between road A going red and road B going green. I don't think it changes the actual timing to halt the traffic.

One of the pubs I worked as a manager at was a Hobgoblin - which, for those of you that don't know, was a chain (originally) run by the brewery of the same name. It had a very mixed crowd with a strong leaning toward students and alternative types in most of it's locations. 
We had our fair share of drunken punch-ups and occasional visits by junkies / crazies / general scumbags, but on a friday or saturday night the people we had to watch the the most was groups of 30-40 yr old white geezers dressed up in white jeans, smart shoes, trendy pastel shirts and usually some sort of chunky jewellery. 

If you got a gang of these fuckers in your pub you could pretty much guarantee you were in for an evening of overt cocaine use, sexist, racist and homophobic harassment of staff and customers, complaints about unwanted attention and groping, usually followed by some sort of punch up or shouting match. 



So yeah, not really surprising to me.

I've commuted by bike through London nearly every day for the past year or so and the majority of the time it's fine. Most cyclists don't do stupid things, some cyclists do break the rules. I break the rules sometimes because it's safe and convenient to do it occasionally. Most other road users are okay, some pass to close and some are aggressive.

The worst and most dangerous parts of my commutes are due to poor road design. Not due to drivers (primarily) and not due to other cyclists.

For example, I used to navigate Hammersmith roundabout everyday. Lanes disappear and merge a lot around that roundabout and unsurprisingly cars end up in the wrong lane and then try to fight back across. It was a nightmare but not inherently their fault, in my opinion.

Places were the road pinches in for no obvious reason are also awful but again not really drivers faults but you need to be a confident cyclist to take the lane in situations like that.

true,VegetaHimura,tennant,Tennant,"I was immensely disappointed with series 7. 

All the episodes were rushed beyond belief. 

The storyline for the exit of the Ponds is too short to actually appreciate that they're leaving and then we get a rushed goodbye (where Rory gets ignored entirely because he's already gone which is another issue I take, especially after all the buildup with his dad) that's over before we can even process that it's happening. 

Clara's storyline is not just convoluted but also literally unknowable.  It was played out as ""oh, we have to solve Clara's mystery"" while giving no one (Not even the Doctor, himself, might I add) any clues as to what the true answer could be. Then, Moffat pulls the answer out of his ass at literally the last possible second so we don't have any chance to question it and then reveals John Hurt's Doctor (which is a whole other issue entirely that you don't want to get me started on) to distract us from how little sense his bullshit ""Clara jumped into my timestream"" excuse actually makes.

Aside from all that, character development is basically nonexistent. There's a little bit of it in ""A Town Called Mercy"", but that's only because that was the only episode that bothered to slow down enough to take a breath. 

* At the beginning of the season The Doctor is sad and lonely. At The midway point of the season, he's sad, lonely, and DARK. At the End of the season, he's sad and dark

* At the beginning of the season, Clara is clever and witty and she can keep up with the Doctor. Mid point of the season, we see a victorian Clara who's clever and witty and keeps up with the Doctor and see her turn into a modern-day Clara who's clever and witty, albeit out of her element (even if she does catch up rather quickly). At the end of the season, all of the sudden she's this tragic hero who jumped into the Doctor's timestream so that she could save his life, despite not really seeming to have developed a very strong relationship with the Doctor in the first place (at least not one that would warrant the amount she sacrificed for him)

* At the beginning of the season, the poor Ponds are about to get a divorce. A little trip with the Doctor, and it's all solved within 20 minutes. Oh, and Rory tries to sacrifice himself for Amy for the millionth time, only to find that the Doctor made it so that he didn't have to. At the midpoint of the season, Rory and Amy are hunky dory until Rory gets kidnapped by the Weeping Angels. Shit happens and Rory tries to sacrifice himself yet again but this time Amy decides to go ""together or not at all."" Luckily, that saves them all! Until Rory gets taken again. And Amy goes after him. They love each other. Like always.

Everyone's either basically the same as when they started, had a giant plot twist thrown at them, or dead. Also, have I mentioned enough how rushed the episodes were yet? Because I think it still bears repeating.

Overall, to me Series 7 is a lot of wasted potential. It's the culmination of someone wanting to write ""film quality"" stories and stuffing them into the too-small box of 45 minutes. Also, for me personally, it's the worst season of Doctor Who I've experienced (even if I started with NuWho and haven't quite made it through all of the older serials yet).",0,1378372971,null,0,false,0,cc24i3b,t3_1lrqk0,t1_cc24i3b,t3_1lrqk0,null,1429583736,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

true,keithb,eng-durham,Economic migrant from Durham in London,"&gt; a source within Finance Interns, a start-up that specialises in matching interns with employers, says that interns may feel as if their total presence on a deal is critical, when this rarely is the case.

However, since interns are getting paid jack the I-banks are more than happy for them to think this, and even more so for new hires who used to be interns to think this. Presenteeism is rife in the banks, and this is one place that it starts.

&gt;“One of these deals does not hinge on an intern, who although may be the crème de la crème of their university, it doesn’t hinge on them sitting at their desk for 23 hours, as opposed to 11 hours.

11 hours would be outrageous all by itself, to anyone not involved in banking.

&gt;And if it does, then that deal team, I think their clients would be quite shocked to learn that.

Kinda.

&gt;They’d be asking, what the hell am I paying all these fees for[?]

What indeed? I-Banks and clients are all involved in this mutual pact to agree to pretend that everyone is involved in a value-adding activity.
 
&gt;I might as well get some high calibre, hard-working students from the nearest university and pay them a tenth the price, and get as good a job. But that’s not the case.”

In fact, it *is* the case. Except...the ""research"" that interns do in support of these deals is re-heated copy-paste from previous deals plus a little light searching through WSJ and FT articles and everyone knows this but the substantive content, if any, is not the point. The point is that when the CFO of the client has to explain to their investors (mostly banks!) why their latest brilliant M+A scheme put many, many millions through the shredder (except that the banks collected their fees!) he can point to the ""research"" from JP SwissCitiFargo and have plausible deniability. What the clients are paying for is the logo on the cover.

The interns offer themselves up as willing victims to this machine because they envision themselves fifteen years later tootling their second Porsche to their third home, and the banks are happy to take advantage of that greed-driven delusion.

That particular intern was especially unlucky, and his ""employer"" was careless, but I doubt that he or they did not have their eyes open.

Keep left, watch your mirrors and its fine up there, specially with it being one way.

The real problems I've found during TT (and the ManxGP but to a way lesser extent) are in and around towns and traffic. The amount of bikers that do completely idiotic stuff is mind blowing. It seems as if some sort of mob mentality kicks it, because there's loads of bikes and bikers around, they think they own any road they are on and rules don't apply to them any more. The amount of near misses I've had just riding the 3miles back into Douglas from work during TT far outweighs anything I've had on the mountain all year round. Then again a 125 on L's doesn't go much faster than 50mph up the mountain :)

I've lived over here for 5 years now, and I'm starting to lose all interest in the TT tbh. I don't really go out of my way to spectate for the racing any more, you see more on the TV shows anyway. I just try taking good photo's if I get the chance to go out for it. 

Now, if you're into older bikes, want to avoid the huge crowds, and have quieter roads (no one way on the mountain though), the Manx GP is fantastic, and I'd probably recommend it over the TT. I'd say fly/foot passenger over for the middle weekend of TT for saturday racing mad sunday and monday racing if you really want to see it, but do the whole 2 weeks of the Manx GP as a road trip.",0,1378380513,null,0,false,0,cc25ewn,t3_1lpwen,t1_cc25ewn,t1_cc1q4ua,null,1429583311,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1
true,blueb0g,eng-durham,Durham,"The worst suggestion on this thread, if it isn't a joke. 

Firstly, the problem is going fast and not having time to stop when something suddenly comes out of the fog. Speeding up, even for a little bit, is an unacceptable risk. 

Secondly, the reason why slowing down is a risk is because there are people behind you, possibly going very fast, who will not have time to see and avoid crashing into you if there is a large difference between his speed and yours. So if you speed up to get away from the traffic before slowing down, you are just increasing the chance of a collision - the person behind will still reach you eventually, but now the speed difference between the two vehicles is greater.

The best option is to brake constantly but lightly, with a low deceleration rate but with the brake light constantly activated, with the hazards on. That gives the lowest overall risk as you are both braking but giving the people behind you enough time to slow down before they hit.

true,henleyregatta,hampshire,Hampshire,"The core problem here is that what you've identified as the ""problem"" - consultancy bosses promising and not delivering - *they* identify as the core business model.

The real money in the outsourcing business **is not** made on contract signing date. It's made 3 years down the line when the customer's so tied up and committed to what they've bought that the fact they'll have to shell out 50-200% more *to the same people* to get something that works is just accepted.

And *that* happens because the contract says ""we'll do X and it'll take 5 years to deliver"", but the world's moved on and what's needed is no longer X in 5 years, but X in 4 years, X+Y in 5, and X-Y+Z in 6 years. 

Now it's never been clear to me why the Customers here (and I'm talking *all* outsourcing customers, commercial and public-sector) still sign these restrictive contracts up-front and then pay for deviations. Why are they still making these costly decisions and regretting them later? It's been going on for at least 20 years and I don't see any change.

You can't just decriminalise it and hope for the best.  That won't work.

(1)separating Weird Al and Dalek allows whovians and Al-aholics to find it in the search feature.  


(2) Appreciation of a cosplay doesn't require you to notice or even comprehend every detail in order to share it on the internet.  

(3) I know first hand experience that as I just tried posting it on Facebook and felt that writing variations of weirdalek felt more like it's implying Al's name is Alek.  It's Alfred.  Not trying to split hairs but it felt off.  It looks beautiful as an accordion brand label font but not in casual writing.  



(4) It's far better than appearing tactless by calling a conscientious choice a 'screw' up and then emphasize the correction by SHOUTING!  I'm betting you had friendly and casual intention but we have to be very conscientious of how our fellow Redditors don't know who each other is and even when we do know each other we have to make assumptions about what tone we bring to a text based conversation.  It's why experts in the field of couples/family psychology emphasize that you never have serious or tense discussions via text.

Now let's go forth and enjoy this cosplay and celebrate our common fandoms.  Get psyched for 50th anniversary special and maybe Weird Al's upcoming album. :)

it will take him 4.23 seconds to break and travel 55 meters doing so.

true,william-in-the-hague,null,null,"To deconstruct Kevin Sabet:

&gt; It is easy to be dissatisfied with current drugs policies. Kids report they can get drugs relatively easily, and too many of us have suffered the heartbreak of addiction affecting a loved one or ourselves. The market for drugs is violent and deadly.

Rhetoric to get onside with the reader, we can ignore this.

&gt; But being unhappy with the drug abuse in society is no reason to legalise drugs.

It seems we have jumped to the conclusion, and one that isn't substantiated in the slightest.

&gt; In fact, the best evidence we have shows that legalisation would make a bad drug problem much worse - by increasing addiction, normalising use among kids, and relegating its sale to profit-hungry corporations or governments with every incentive to increase addiction to advance their bottom line. Legalisation is a very sloppy way to address the unintended consequences of current policy.

The best evidence he doesn't cite, and probably doesn't exist. Most of his complaints can be applied to alcohol. It's legal status increases addiction, normalised use among kids, and has rampant profiteering. Sloppy is jumping to the conclusion with little argument. 

&gt; First, we know that legalisation would significantly cheapen the price of cocaine, cannabis, and heroin, making them more accessible and therefore increasing addiction. Additionally, allowing drugs to be sold on the open market implies we would allow the sale of highly dangerous drugs such as crack and methamphetamine by multinational conglomerates.

Cannabis would effectively be free because it's a weed that largely grows anywhere. Magic mushrooms grow locally. There are at least two sources where multinationals are not relevant so Sabet is presenting an oversimplification of the issue.

&gt; Big Tobacco would have nothing on Big Meth.

Scare mongering isn't scientific Dr' Sabet.

&gt; Second, it is unclear that a major attraction of legalisation - the supposed reduction of the violent, underground market - would materialise. As governments put restrictions like age limits on legal drugs, the illicit economy will be happy to step in to fill the gap. We know now that at least 22% of the UK domestic tobacco market consists of black market illegal cigarettes.

More scaremongering, at least he hasn't invoked a funding of terrorism. Perhaps then age limits on drugs aren't the answer and that's what parents are for. Oddly enough I hope Sabet wants to ban lighter fluid, Lynx and other already legal artefacts that have psychoactive effects. Enough kids have managed to stay clear of those hazards to the point where the world hasn't ended.

Sabet sleazily talks about under age use then slides to a statistic on the **total size** of the black market. Unless pocket money has gone up these days, I think most of that 22% (again some dangling stat) is trafficked too adults. Avoiding taxation would be the obvious candidate. 

&gt; Yes, mass incarceration is a bad thing. And the developing world is being torn apart by the UK's appetite for drugs. **[I think you mean oil and neoliberalism.]** But rather than legalise - which would increase crime and potentially increase incarceration rates - **[based on what evidence?]** we should invest more in strategies such as drug treatment, specialised drug treatment courts, better drug prevention, smart enforcement, and international partnerships that promote alternative development.

[Sabet is a ""doctor"" that has worked for the private healthcare as a full time opinionist against legalisation, and a once senior speech writer for Bush.](http://kevinsabet.com/about)

&gt; The UK is moving in the right direction. By expanding treatment and recovery services over the past decade, drug use has fallen almost 15% between 2005 and 2011. But we still have more work to do. In the legalisation debate, misleading promises and silver bullets abound. Proceed with caution.

Sabet concedes that drug availability is high in his opening paragraph yet drug use is falling. I have to deduce that people have more self control than prohibitionists make out.

I'd suggest [making one on this site](http://micapeak.com/checklists/mclist.html), of everything you can think of (most things should be covered already) and trying to pack that on the bike. It won't all fit.

Now you can assign *your* priorities and remodel the general list to what *you* need. Make sure to use waterproof liners for your panniers/boxes, black bags work fine if you are cheap like me. Take a separate waterproof liner for clothing and electronics. Getting those wet really sucks.

A few things you always want to keep at the top of a bag:

Waterproof gear, warm top/hoodie.

(Being cold and wet is dangerous and ruins the fun)

Water and food for at least one full meal.

(Being hungry and dehydrated ruins the fun too)

If you are going to be riding a lot and don't fancy taking lots of clothes a neat trick is to wear one of those moisture wicking sports tops under your regular clothing. This keeps you dry and helps to regulate your body temp better in warm and cold weather, with the added benefit of keeping your clothing clean. They are quick drying so you can wash them every night and have them dry by morning.

That's all I can think of right now... If you have any questions about specific stuff I'm happy to help!

I think most importantly, have fun! It's not really about where you are going on the bike, it's about the journey to get there.

true,girlfrodo,null,null,"I drive through the New Forest regularly, where the majority of the roads have a speed limit of 40mph, due to the hundreds of horses, cows, donkeys, deer etc roaming about. Naturally most people do about 50mph,  some do a lot more, and it's really thanks to that that us locals are regularly greeted by the sad sight of a dead animal waiting to be collected by the verderers. Despite this, if you're driving at 40 mph, you're likely to be tailgated or overtaken.

Driving through the forest in the dark or with reduced visibility due to weather is *hazardous*, and I had the absolute shit scared out of me when returning from a long shift at work recently by a car tailgating me the whole 30 mins we travelled through the forest. His lights were blinding me, he kept flashing me, and I could clearly see his face in my rear view mirror. I indicated left, slowed down, moved over at the first good overtaking spot... He simply followed me. There are lay-bys, but as a lone female driver in the dark, I really didn't want to pull over on the chance he'd follow me. He eventually turned off as we left the forest, but I was in tears by the time he did so. That said, I stuck to 40mph. No way was I risking a cow coming through my windshield just to please the arrogant bastard sitting on my cars arse. 

TLDR; New Forest is a prime spot for tailgaters due to speed limit and lack of overtake opportunities and I had the crap scared out of me whilst driving in the dark recently.",0,1378388168,null,0,false,0,cc26xa6,t3_1lru5r,t1_cc26xa6,t1_cc24xch,null,1429582607,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

The pro-legalisation people claim it will solve everything, just like the 'hard on crime/drugs' people do. They're as bad as each other.

The answer, as with everything, is some sort of middle ground. Something like legalisation of soft drugs that can be sold in pharmacies in the same class as codeine. Hard drugs remain prohibited but an emphasis on rehab rather than punishment for early offenders, and of course still facing full legal consequences for the crimes you did while on drugs (burglaries, robberies etc). And there needs to be a proper effort to shut down access to drugs in prison since that is where many addictions actually start, plus it means that people don't come off drugs when they go to jail.

Bullshit.  Yes it's laburious work, yes it means lots of meetings as you gather information from users (front end design) and other systems you're trying to slurp.  But it's not that complex.

What makes it complex is a bunch of managers running around who fundamentally don't know what they're doing beyond having a vision of the finished product; a vision that is usually not grounded in either reality or end-user expectations. 

If you could just herd those numpties somewhere safe and away from the people who know what they're doing then many more IT projects would complete on time and with a high EU satisfaction (i.e. it'll do what it says on the tin).

Absolutely.  Mediocre finishes from us in the past couple of years have led them to grow complacent.  We are doing very well so far, and have fixed several problems.  We now have wonderful depth at the back and up front, with multiple very good players we can choose for CB or striker.  Our midfield is well sorted out as well, and, of course, Mignolet is an upgrade on Reina.  (I didn't think so at first, but he's changed my mind pretty quickly.)

Tactically we know what we're doing, and what each player's role is.  We're not searching around for the best midfield any more.  And in the first three games of the season (albeit not against Notts County) we've displayed an ability to go ahead in games and just shut the game down without the ball.  We've been missing this kind of defensive organization since SC left for West Brom, and more broadly we haven't been able to shut teams out of games when we go ahead since the Rafa era.  It's a good sign from BR, and my doubts about his defensive acumen have been significantly eased.

We also have fit and in-form players (crossed fingers) which is excellent, and far better than last year, when we had to deal with the absence of Lucas, Skrtel's deterioration, and very out-of-form Stevie G, Enrique, Hendo, and Downing at the start of the season.",0,1378389810,null,0,false,0,cc27dgc,t3_1ls2h4,t1_cc27dgc,t3_1ls2h4,null,1429582397,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Yet the world keeps on turning. I covered that.

&gt; The pro-legalisation people claim it will solve everything, just like the 'hard on crime/drugs' people do. They're as bad as each other.

Strawman. Legalisation is better than the prohibition, that's the case that is always made. Without legalisation it's very hard to expand drug rehab because you know, people get put in prison and end up with criminal records. Did you know drugs can't even be kept out of prison?

&gt; The answer, as with everything, is some sort of middle ground. 

[Middle ground fallacy.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_to_moderation) It's almost never the case that the middle ground is the truth. Scientific study gets us there and scientists are clear: legalise.

&gt; facing full legal consequences for the crimes you did while on drugs (burglaries, robberies etc)

You are working with wonky prejudices. Nearly all drug users don't have other criminal activity.

&gt; And there needs to be a proper effort to shut down access to drugs in prison since that is where many addictions actually start, plus it means that people don't come off drugs when they go to jail.

Prohibition doesn't work.

&gt; plus it means that people don't come off drugs when they go to jail

It can very often mean people go on to drugs when they go to jail. Pushers have a captive audience.

&gt; Securing a prison should be relatively easier than securing the borders and streets of the UK, so that would be a good place to start.

You would think. These problems essentially go away if most recreational drugs are legalised. Bad laws are hard to police, the fact that drugs have never been out of prisons should tell you what to think of current drug laws. The real solution to drug abuse is making a sober life more attractive than intoxication. There is a reason why users and poverty correlate, from crack heads in the ghetto to Bengali orphans getting high off burning plastics they find at the local dump.

I didn't even touch on the freedom argument: why can't I eat marijuana? My layman's biology tells me my body has a range of sensory perceptions that tell me what is edible and what is not. Things that smell good tend to mean something. Why can't I eat magic mushrooms? Why is augmented reality illegal?

&gt;Dyson Malaysia is home to our manufacturing centre. It's also where engineers conduct final testing and development to finish machines ready for production. In the eight years we've been there, our local workforce has increased by 88% – and it's set to grow a further 45% in the next six years. Of the 450 people working at Dyson Malaysia, 75% are highly skilled engineers and technicians.

I'm not all gung ho for the company or anything, just saying they definitely are employing people, in number, in the UK too.  And skilled jobs it would seem. Exporting manufacturing is a sad reality.

Oh, OK, so now we legalise prostitution, but gangs will adapt again and find some other shite (loan sharks, or something, I'm no expert).

- Just because it's free, doesn't mean people will prefer to make public their addiction.  How many mentally ill people (i.e. schizophrenics) refuse help until it's too late, due to the stigma attached to mental illness?  How many men are told: ""Man up!"" when they tell someone they're feeling depressed?  If I could get a fix in private (via a dealer) instead of letting it known to my friends and loved ones, I would.  Although, of course: free vs. paying for the stuff. 

- As someone else has said, classifying: ""addictive and non-addictive"" - this point is valid: with how many people die to alcohol-related crime, why isn't *that* made illegal?  Is marijuana truly addictive ('recreational weed smokers') or cocaine (some people are able to take it and not be addicted)?  Also, the incompetence of our fucking government to listen to experts in the field, *really* doesn't fill me with confidence.

- Plus, the ethics: your own government is supplying you.  They're *not* weaning you off, they are *supplying* your addiction.  Although, I assume weaning you off is the ultimate motive.

ISAs (Cash or otherwise) are ways of saving money &amp; not being taxed on the interest earned over the year. Every year you can put in a total of £5,760 into a cash ISA. You can also put a further £5,760 into a stocks &amp; shares ISA. (A total of £11,520 into the two types of ISA, but only half of that can go into the cash one, if you get me).

That's the limit per year - in a new tax year you can add more money up to the limit again. You can't roll over an allowance limit from year to year.

Some say that if you're saving then the ISA is the best option to start off, as fairly good rates can be found and of course you don't get taxed on the interest.

I'm looking into the stocks &amp; shares ISA side of things at the moment, so if anyone has any pointers then I'd be grateful too.",0,1378393198,null,0,false,0,cc28f77,t3_1ls9gf,t1_cc28f77,t3_1ls9gf,null,1429581836,6,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,6

I'd rather have the club do the business now and under Rodgers, for Gerrard's sake as a player, then wait for the day he bottles it so one of these lads step in.

That said, I agree with those who think Stevie wouldn't be the best manager. I'm not basing that on the Americanism that only bad players are good coaches, but rather that good coaches tend to see and play the game in a specific way. I can see if Stevie G comes around to seeing the game another way, but his strengths have always been his verve, not his tactical acumen.

Thats part of the reason I think people always brought Carra up as manager and Stevie as AM.

Now if you put this on a timeline, Rodgers is 40. I think most clubs would agree that the desire is to have a coach lead the club for a long time. If Rodgers does that for another 10 years he's only 50. I mean he could manager us for 25 years and still be prime coaching age.

They needed to confirm her eligibility to be deported there as a Jordanian national - which they have since done. And they had no basis to suggest she had been in either Egypt or Jordan since leaving Palestine, making then ineligible as Safe Third Countries.

Asylum seekers do NOT have a duty to go to the first safe country they can. It is more complicated than that. 

What happens is that if they have been in another country prior to the UK, since leaving their origin country, and the UK considers that to be a safe country, then that is an option to deport them to. This is the ""safe third country"" rule. It also counts against their claim if they did not claim asylum in that country.

I am not sure why Saudi Arabia wasn't an option though. It seems to be a viable and eligible safe third country.

Edit: Did a bit of research on this, apparently Saudi Arabia had been determined in a number of jurisdictions to NOT be a safe third country for non-Saudi nationals. It's quite likely the UKBA concurs.

Yes and quicker than agencies do. For example my tenant told me the TV antenna had fallen down. 2hrs later a man was on the roof fitting a new mast. I doubt that the agency would've even phoned someone within 2hrs. I am absolutely paranoid about gas safety checks.

&gt; Do YOU credit check &amp; vet tenants to avoid those who are bad risks?

No to the credit check because a good credit record doesn't mean a tenant will always pay the rent or that they won't wreck the place. Don't need insurance to cover the cost of repossession because it doesn't cost a massive amount and an agency's commission and charges over a year far outweigh a month's lost rent.

&gt; I can see why landlords might resent the high cost of paying an agent but a good agent will do all this and more

As far as goals and assists (final product), I'm not sure this will be the year he figures that out. Right now his tactical awareness and legs are keeping us alive. That's his role. And its a very defined one. With all the creativity and options around, I don't see him being the one making the final pass or taking the shot too often.

Sure, he may score a handful of goals and pick up some assists, but that won't be what defines this being a successful season.

We will play some brilliant football this season, I have no doubt about that.

2. If a character was going to be written out I would have had them killed so the show remains suspenseful and you truly felt like anyone could die at any time 

3. Started building a larger cast earlier so that old ones leaving and new ones coming in was less jarring

4. Inclusion of another group of powered individuals that acted as a major antagonist for the Asbo group over the course of the show - not necessarily villains, but a group of people whose motivations and interests often acted in conflict with those of the protagonists. 

5. Significant morality change for certain characters over the course of the show...at least ONE of the characters should have eventually started abusing their power for ill gain and split away from the main group. Aside from Simon, and the group becoming more comfortable with each other, the characters don't actually develop much over the course of the show. 

6. Used the power swap more effectively, but I'm not sure how exactly. Also would have considered changing Curtis's original power so it wasn't a massive deux ex machinae 

7. As everyone as mentioned by now, more use of their powers. Possibly even increased control of their powers over time.

I've noticed people online increasingly calling it 'prohibition' recently. Keep calling it that all you want but the attempt at controlling the language war won't affect anything. The UK isn't legalising drugs any time soon until the public can actually prove themselves to be responsible with that freedom. Alcohol is legal, pretty cheap (cheap enough to deter underground counterfeit stuff) and is fairly well controlled with lots of legal framework surrounding the manufacture, sale and legalities of possessing, using and abusing it. There is also generally good education about alcohol and the effects are well known and understood by the majority of the population. And yet, despite that, it still causes chaos in terms of crime, health and societal breakdown. So that example of drug legalisation isn't exactly shining paradise.

There's stats for him compared to the other best chance creating midfielders in the world posted somewhere in /r/soccer right now that show he simply blows everyone out of the water for chances created and assists (including all the Barca players who get to play with Messi and all the Bayern guys).

try to find some Real matches from last season and watch them, his quality will jump out at you.  His vision and passing ability is absolutely jaw dropping at times.  He's insanely dangerous and makes it extremely easy for anyone he plays with to score.  If Giroud stays on form and Walcott continues to impress then they're going to feel like it's Christmas in every match as Ozil puts them through on goal.

For Ozil's impact on the Germany side... Low is crazy about him, even voted for him for player of the year over the likes of Sweinsteiger, Neuer, Gotze, and Muller.  He's a hard comparison to Muller because they have such different skillsets and play a bit different positions but he lines up well in comparison to Gotze.  While Mario is a bit younger he's way off of Ozil's ability.

We should be really scared of Arsenal with Ozil orchestrating their attach, he's a world beater.  Thankfully their defense looks a bit rough and I think they have some golakeeping issues too.  We match up quite well with them and where we have Suarez to provide that extra little bit of spark and invention, they now have Ozil.

Not that there is anything wrong with having a shit car, just don't make a big deal out of it.

That said, I drove in the northern part of Finland and the fog lights made a big difference, the idea is being closer to the ground, you won't get dazzled so much.  As the closer to the windscreen, the more change that the light will bounce of the water and straight back in your face.

They aren't required by law.  Having them doesn't really change (imnsho) by much what is drivable and what isn't.  People have this terrible attitude which we can see voiced in this thread, that they have a God-given right to drive, because its such a necessity.  Well sorry no one does.  If the weather is very bad, wait it out. This is why fog lights on the front are not required, because they won't give you a magical guarantee that you can always drive.  Sorry I'm ranting here.

What I would say, is spend a little bit of quality time with your car.  Learn what it's got and what it hasn't.

The rates for cash ISAs are frankly quite abysmal at the moment, so whilst you can shop around, you're unlikely to find anything paying much over 2.1% - get the best rate you can. The big weekend newspapers usually have a rates guide in the money section that also explains things quite well. One thing to watch out for is the rates plummeting after a year, so be prepared to shop around for a new ISA account every year to move your money to.

Other options for saving - a Santander 123 account, which pays 3% interest on your balance (up to a certain amount), though remember that this won't be tax free, so if you're a basic rate taxpayer then really you're getting 2.4% as you're paying 20% of your interest earnings in tax.

true,Artoo_Detoo,RC,china,"Honestly someone had to be left out.  Out of the 25 slots for the Champions League, 8 of them are for homegrown in country, 4 of those 8 are for homegrown in club.  So there are 17 non-homegrown slots available.  Thus, you need to select 17 out of these 18:

Petr Cech, Mark Schwarzer, David Luiz, Branislav Ivanovic, Cesar Azpilicueta, Michael Essien, Ramires, Marco van Ginkel, John Obi Mikel, Fernando Torres, Juan Mata, Oscar, Andre Schurrle, Kevin De Bruyne, Eden Hazard, Demba Ba, Willian, Samuel Eto'o

So, going through them, position by position, skipping midfield:


Goalkeepers: Cech, Schwarzer

This is a no-brainer.

Defenders: David Luiz, Branislav Ivanovic, Cesar Azpilicueta

Only one you'd potentially knock out is Azpilicueta, but that would leave Ivanovic as the lone RB, bad idea

Attacking mids: Juan Mata, Oscar, Andre Schurrle, Kevin De Bruyne, Eden Hazard, Willian

You'd be crazy to leave out Mazacar, de Bruyne just came back from loan and seems to be needed in the first squad, and Schurrle and Willian are new signings that Mourinho probably want to use.  If anyone would be left out, it'd probably be Willian as he is the newest member of the squad and not sure where he'd fit in right now.

Forwards: Fernando Torres, Demba Ba, Samuel Eto'o

Yeah, we'll probably need all 3 of them, Ba would potentially be the odd man out.

So outside of midfield, the only potential players to leave out are Cesar Azpilicueta, Willian, and Demba Ba.  Probably all bad ideas.

Midfield: Michael Essien, Ramires, Marco van Ginkel, John Obi Mikel

Unlike last year, that's actually a decent amount of depth when you consider Frank Lampard is homegrown in England.  Obi and Ramires should be obvious, it's down to Essien and van Ginkel.  And in the end, Mourinho's decision is to give van Ginkel some match practice, especially given the easy group Chelsea have been drawn in.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Crime will change, but will not be erased: prostitution and human trafficking will increase - how long before we legalise prostitution?

Will they increase? I've not seen any reports that say they will. Undoubtedly some people will move into other illegal activity, but overall the black market trade would be hugely diminished. It's impossible to stop all black market activity (alcohol, cigarettes, clothing etc) but overall most people would take the legal route.


&gt; Just because it's free, doesn't mean people will prefer to make public their addiction. 

it wouldn't have to be public. You could talk to a health professional confidentially. At the moment addicts are justifiably terrified with interacting with health services as it can have a negative impact on them due to the legal issues involved.


&gt; As someone else has said, classifying: ""addictive and non-addictive"" - this point is valid: with how many people die to alcohol-related crime, why isn't that made illegal?

There isn't any such thing unfortunately. If someone's dopamine receptors don't work correctly for example, and they take something (like cocaine, speed) ,or experience something (skydiving) that enables them to function, that person can become addicted. It's true to say that alcohol kills many people, but that number would be multiplied if you banned it. Look at what happened to prohibition of alcohol in America. Death rates sky-rocketed and people indulged in riskier drug taking (injecting alcohol wasn't uncommon)

&gt; Plus, the ethics: your own government is supplying you. They're not weaning you off, they are supplying your addiction. Although, I assume weaning you off is the ultimate motive.

Is weaning someone off a substance ethically sound? I'm not saying it isn't, but whether it's supply or prevention it all depends on the individual who is being affected. It might well be that someone has had a terrible life, is in constant mental and physical pain and would rather be medicated.",0,1378400624,null,0,false,0,cc2b5od,t3_1lrvqv,t1_cc2b5od,t1_cc27x56,null,1429580559,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,strolls,null,null,"The point, then, is that this is not an actual request for advice, but you want to ""prove"" it's not possible to start a business these days?

That's a genuine question - I'm trying to understand. You seem to be replying to every suggestion to say ""nah, can't do that"".

In particular, your submission headline asks about ""investments"", and then you dismiss advise to buy shares or put money into a FTSE index.

£25,000 is both an awful lot of money which which to start a business, and also a pittance. 

The most important factor in starting a new venture is the abilities and determination of the entrepreneur - as long as you've got a bit of nous and you work hard (more than average of each, at least) then you'll be ok. 

I doubt if there's any business which you can start with £25,000 and then just turn your back, walk away and forget about it. The idea of passive earnings is largely a fabrication, invented to sell Tim Ferris' fiction. The only thing that comes close to ""passive income"" is investing in rental property (£25,000 would probably get you a BTL mortgage - little income for 15 or 20 years, but a fully paid-off house at the end of it), and even with that, you'll get better returns if you're actually active in its management. 

If you're talking about starting your own business outright, then what you're *really* investing in it is some money and a good deal your own time and effort - otherwise you might as well just piss that money straight down the drain. To make a proper livelihood from a venture you need to spend not only the funds necessary, but also you need to sacrifice your current job, to have sufficient time to invest.

*and* a nice looking detailed site for each GTA: http://projectcerbera.com/gta/

That leads a little deeper to here (assuming you are basing on vice city): http://projectcerbera.com/gta/vc/tutorials/editors

There is a link to a model editor, a map editor, texture editor and a collision editor - amongst other tools.

Those really should be enough to get started (perhaps with a little more info!)

There's a constant theme from nationalists which is based on a fallacy.

The fallacy is that if the ""no"" campaign is a negative campaign then it must be the wrong choice and that the ""no"" campaign have to create a positive campaign.

I don't for one second agree. The default position is the current status quo, and the no campaign (if it's even needed) simply needs to argue with whatever the yes campaign says is a reason for independence.

I'm also suspicious that this video might be convincing because of how patriotic it's going to make people feel up until the 2.30 mark.

It's an extremely well known sales technique that you get people to agree with you, lots of times and then when you drop the sale in you can close it. This is what this video attempts to do.

There are also details missing. Did the station staff do this INSTEAD of getting the signals changed to red?

The train was ""just minutes"" away and looking at the live departures for Southend Central it was likely a stopping service, so it had time to stop where it was and they could not only work safely, but they wouldn't feel time pressured.

true,PerfectlyNormal77,tardis,TARDIS,"To be honest, I do think that Moffat's showrunning qualities have dropped a bit. Series five, to me, was incredibly tight and well done. Series six started well, but then the quality dipped as the series went along (the decision to split the series in two helped hugely). By the time of Series 7, the stories were decent enough, but the execution really didn't match what had come earlier.

But the same thing can be said of RTD. For the longest time, I HATED RTD as a showrunner. It seemed like he would rather go for the tried and true (how many times can you have the Daleks for finale villains?!) or the cheap gag rather than really pushing where Doctor Who could go. Then I read The Writer's Tale and I started rethinking my opinion of RTD.

To showrun Doctor Who is an insane job. INSANE. As showrunner, you have to come up with ALL THE PLOTS (unless you have a safety outlet, like RTD had with Moffat, who came up with his own plots), assign said plots to writers, rewrite the scripts completely, and also keep up with your own writing. Oh, and you're producing, editing, and casting all at the same time. That's a RIDICULOUS amount of work for one person to do.

That much work leads to burnout. Which leads to sloppy showrunning.

Remember, it is not truly 6%, as it works on £300 increments. So if you already have a lumpsum of £3600, this may not be worthwhile as at the end of a year, you would come out with £3700. This is equivalent of 2.75% pa on £3600 lump. The benefit is, you don't have to have the entire value locked up for 12 months. 

Although with the best savings account being ironically a current account at 3% this would be less at £3687. That is before counting the £2/pm charge unless you can mitigate it with Direct Debit cashback.

So the FD deal is quite good. Although it used to be better at 8%. The optimum solution would be for £3600...

£3600 in Santander, moving over £300 each month into FD. With enough Direct Debits to cover the £2/m charge. This will start you at 3% for about 3 months, unless you can keep it above £3000.

true,HorriBliss,null,null,"I'm not entirely sure that crime will increase, but I'm pretty sure that criminals won't sit-tight on the money previously made - they'll be chasing the next market they can find, be it human trafficking, gambling, prostitution, kidnappings -- I don't know.  I mean, I have no evidence, it's all just conjecture, but doesn't that make logical sense?

As it currently stands, you can talk to a health professional confidentially, but there's still a social stigma attached to it (although it's falling - thankfully).  The people who need it most -- the lower class -- are the same exact ones who'll be held up to: ""man up"" by their peers/family.  So yes, whilst I'm sure more people will go: would it be those who need it most?

&gt; It's true to say that alcohol kills many people, but that number would be multiplied if you banned it. 

I'm not saying ban it, just levy it sky-high.  You can have as many bad habits as you want, but you'll quickly learn to moderate if it pinches your wallet.  However, it's the lower-class again who'll be affected the most with that, and therefore lead to more petty crime I imagine.  Gosh, there really isn't an easy fix here, is there?

Also, I feel that some of the more extreme things like drinking whiskey so potent it blinded you, or injecting alcohol was due to a lack of proper medical understanding, and wasn't the norm.  For example, there are people out there who inject steroids straight into their arm, but I'd hardly label that as a 'danger', rather some people are sheer idiots, y'know?

Maybe it's not ethically sound to wean them off, but it's certainly beneficial I feel.  There are other ways of escapism beyond hard-drugs, but, being addicted to World of Warcraft can be just as damaging as having a drug addiction.  As you rightfully say: it's the brain's release of dopamine that causes an addictive behaviour to be repeated.

The club also offer hospitality packages but with the included accommodation Thomas Cook was slightly better value for us.

It will be quite a lot cheaper if you choose a less sought after fixture, but I would still recommend going with either Thomas Cook or a Liverpool Hospitality package because it's the only guaranteed way of securing a ticket.

You have real evidence for this that involves a significant number of people? Otherwise we're down to the entire world's problems being caused by capitalist multinational facist corporations, as is popular with some redditors/ students.

&gt;1.we can believe the private sector is the only go to source for big projects

Because you don't want to pay any more council tax to pay real IT bods instead of the pay-peanuts result. I've worked for councils, hospitals, the BBC...it's really that simple. As a personal example, leaving my hospital IT job to work for a real company doubled my wages overnight (for doing less). And I am far from alone in that experience.

&gt;2.why government is always inept.

Because when the gov. suggests paying proper wages to managers, or even cabinet ministers, everyone is outraged as if there's some other way of achieving the same (of course, if there was some other way, Murdoch, Barclays and the rest would be doing it already).

In any case, anyone can call the government inept, but then I could level that charge at almost anyone, not just governments, and the result would be the same.

Incredibly stressful, sometimes 75+ hour weeks, holidays mean no money.  I'm self employed and living the dream ;)

I keep myself going with the promise that in 12 months I'll either be bankrupt or moderately rich.  Or just scraping enough to keep the meter running....  Now I'm depressed.

I nearly became a teacher, at uni I was very active in teaching 11-18 yo, also running labs for the year below.  My favourite was my afterschool lego/programming club I ran at a local secondary school.  Only 12 children, but I know I made a massive difference in their lives.  Plus for a uni student the pay was fantastic.

Sure teaching you have some very sad things you have to deal with, watching a thirteen year old come to terms with the fact mummy chooses the bottle over her, and your not even allow to give them a cuddle, tell them things will change, showing such non-sexual but accepting non-conditional love isn't allowed.  She was such a bright child, but ended up following her mothers spiral in life.  That stuff yes, that is hard.

But going in to be a teacher you know what the requirements from you are, you have a very good pay package for a low hour and stress job, with frankly amazing holidays.  Oh and job security too.

I should point out there are two teachers in my close family, so whilst I never did a PGCE, I have a fairly good idea of whats involved.

This is why so many people 'retire' from industry to be a teacher.",0,1378410668,null,0,false,0,cc2f1vj,t3_1lrv6q,t1_cc2f1vj,t1_cc2c7l5,null,1429578742,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I dont think it would be possible for every dealer to do that, and I don't think many would even be inclined to do so. Selling drugs and being a pimp/human trafficker  are two very different games so to speak. You have to consider that a lot of them are selling the stuff in the first place because they themselves are addicts. This is especially true of many of the weed dealers I have met.

Injecting alcohol, like heroin today, mainly came down to financial necessity. When prohibition was in effect the cost was obviously a lot higher so people would do what they could to make it last longer. This is a by-product of prohibition. You can see it happening with the newly banned Methedrone. When it was legal it was £5-£10 a gram and was very strong, you could do one bump of it and feel the effects strongly. Nowadays the price has doubled (at the very least) the quality and strength have plummeted, and I hear of a lot of people who are starting to inject it.

It's right to say that education would help, but that doesn't even begin to happen when it comes to drugs. People are fed lies and misinformation and are therefore unlikely to learn facts, or respect the authorities for lying to them in the first place.

Marin I don't even know. Clearly a talented player but never made an impact.

The transfers and recalls made over the summer clearly spruced up some well needed depth in that position. Arguably it's a shame that Moses went on loan because he did look great pre-season and he played quite differently to the other players we have as well.

The government was using an unrealistic discount rate for the pensions, leaving them largely underfunded. Public sector pensions already take up a huge portion of the budget.

I lost a little bit of respect for the teachers unions after the strike a year or two ago. I saw pamphlets from them that blatantly misrepresented Lord Hutton's report on public sector pensions--they implied the report said that pensions could funded, when in reality the report said pensions could remain funded *only if government reforms were put into place* (and Lord Hutton himself thought the government's offer was very reasonable).

Teachers are very hard-working, but the pension system has to change. It's not a question of fairness, it's mathematics.

Eriksen Vs coutinho good comparison, equal, or maybe coutinho has more experience in the premier league but less overall.

lennon Vs Suarez, are you serious, you are comparing one of the best players in the league with lennon, Arron Lennon? Unfair

Copoue Vs Lucas, yes, i think Lucas is better.

 Paulinho vs Gerrard, even at 34 Gerrard is better than most of the spurs team, I think the reason we have not conceded a goal this season is becasue Gerrard is playing as holding mid along with Lucas.

Rose vs Enrique, yes enrique is better.

Agger is also better than Vertongen

Dawson vs Kolo, Toure has experience but Dawson is also equally good.

Walker Vs Johnson, Johnson more experienced and is maybe a bit better, however Kyle Walker can run like Forest gump.

Lloris vs Mignolet, equal. none better than the other.

Donated blood gets split down into several different products - 

* Packed red cells (what you traditionally think of as a blood transfusion, its red because it contains the red cells... but it isn't really ""blood"" in the true sense of the word, its literally just dense red cells in a liquid solution).

* Platelets

* Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) - all FFP used in the UK, and derivative products like cryoprecipitate are sourced from outside the UK because of the risk of vCJD. This is particularly the case for anyone born after 1996 (as in theroy, all of us born before 1996 *could* have vCJD -- but it remains to be seen how many will develop it, so far hardly any).

* There are lots more, but these are the main blood components most people might come across. 

We also have a huge tracking system in the UK so if a person develops vCJD, any blood product derived from their donation (going all the way back to 1997, although in theory there shouldn't be any of those still in use) can be immiediately pulled ""off the shelf"".

All British blood products also go through a process called leucodepletion to remove white cells, to reduce the chance of transmitting vCJD through transfusion.

I suspect the reason for being so heavy handed is two-fold... remember back in the mid 90s when these measures came into effect the healthcare system was still scarred by having transmitted HIV through blood products in the 1980s - a lot of people with Haemophillias ended up with HIV this way, and of course that means the NHS is liable to bear the cost.

So...you don't see any irony in someone insisting that the UK 'could be better' when they're already demonstrated how UK-centric they aren't based on nothing more than profit?

&gt;So you answered my question with a completely different one.

Nope, I used your logic to demonstrate that it works just as well in reverse.

&gt; I am going to guess that you haven't started a company that has created any large number of jobs.

You mean you're going to repeat the statement instead of addressing why one doesn't need to be Bono to spot a bad tune? Righto.

&gt;This is important, because ultimately you are saying he is ling about the supply chain issues

No, I am not.

&gt;instead suggesting that he did it purely out of some spite that allows him to have another ivory back scratcher.

I'm sure he moved production to Malaysia because he's always had a fondness for their music and profit had nothing to do with it at all.

&gt;No, someone has to actually have a track record of having successfully made such business decisions before criticising others for them.

Let me know when you've finished Achtung Baby 2. Sorry, you're really at a dead-end with that logic which suggests (since you're repeating yourself instead of addressing the replies) that you're making excuses. For another example, are you suggesting that Ebert's opinions on movies were pointless because he never made any himself?

&gt;I just can't understand your attitude, you act as if you know better than the people running the firm, but apparently have no experience running such a firm.

Then stop repeating yourself and ask questions.

&gt;Here's an idea, if you can manufacture something in that area, with the higher price of being in the UK.

Plenty of other companies have produced bagless vacuum cleaners for far less than Dyson do. Bladeless fans are available in Spain for 80 euros.

&gt;Why not do so, prove me wrong. 

See above; you might want to wait on congratulating yourself in future before assuming that because you haven't considered all the information, it doesn't need considering. Or research.

&gt;Otherwise your just the worst kind of armchair quarterback.

Who appears to have given this a bit more thought than 'Wow, he made money, I haven't, his business acumen must be incredible'.

true,strolls,null,null,"I think your perception of risk / effort / reward ratios are skewed by the booms of the 80's, 90's and 00's, which were not inherently enduring (but fuelled by speculation in the wider economy and stuff).

I don't think a business established during those times would have survived the recessions, if it was based on ""effortless returns"". 

I think more applicable truisms of business are that *where there's muck there's brass*, that *if you can make it in a recession, then you'll be market leader when the tough times end and everyone else gets on the bandwagon* and that *you get out what you put in*. 

In my experience, most businesses *are* less return than you'd expect from optimism and a superficial glance at price vs costs - the returns are derived from the effort you put in, driving sales, acquiring new clients and performing service which keeps your customers happy. 

If you look at the margins in retail (for example), they can be razor thin - I wouldn't blame you for thinking ""[3.2%](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/good-retail-profit-margin-14123.html)? why do they even bother?"" That's totally different from markup, where you buy tins of beans for 10p and put them on the shelf for 30p (and you think ""this is a good lark""), except that 20p ""profit"" doesn't include the costs of paying someone to stack them on the shelf, running the checkouts, accounting for losses, &amp;c.

The big boys cope with these thin margins by having robust business processes which are scalable; seeking efficiencies throughout their organisation will pay off exponentially. For a smaller business it may be only hard work which allows you to achieve the volume necessary to make a livelihood. 

If it were easy money then, as you says, the big boys would have moved in.

IMO there are opportunities for profit in all sorts of fields, it just takes commitment (plus the aforementioned nous and effort). IMO entrepreneurship is a balance of optimism in the face of well-considered risks. There are plenty of things you can do as well as anyone else, but you'll probably be the first one in the door in the morning, and the last to leave at night.

I've known at least a handful of self-made millionaires and those I'd bank on with most certainty are still nevertheless putting in 10 hour days, 5 days a week, despite having millions in the bank and easily able to afford a very comfortable (luxurious, even) retirement. 

In that, drive is probably as important as doing something you enjoy or care about.

I think the easy answer investing £40,000 is to get two 25% BTL mortgages on £80,000 1-bedroom flats, and to keep your day job. You basically won't see jack shit until retirement, but then you'll have something in the order of £1000 (at today's rentable values) coming in, all yours (I don't know how this compares to crane shares or FTSE). This leaves you plenty of time to establish a no-costs hobby business evening and weekends to supplement your main income and maybe grow into it.

At 1:30 we see his ability to track a player down from midfield and make the interception. He has a wonderful burst of speed so quick midfielders couldn't just go past him. Great tactical awareness and athleticism for either DM or CB.

(Same clip) then after he makes the interception we see how quickly he can get the ball from defense into the midfield with those long strides. He gets the ball all the way into the opponent's half in a couple effortless touches. He seems like a sweeper more than anything but that's perfect for Rodgers' system. In the Barca/Rodgers ideal orgasmic 4-3-3, it's basically a 3-4-3 in attack; 2 centerbacks playing wide and deep with a DM sitting between them and fullbacks basically playing as wingers.

You can see the types of passes he sees naturally -- pacey throughballs forward (2:29). He has not only the mobility but also the vision for a pass that a midfielder needs, and I bet that one Steven Gerrard could teach him a bit about controlling the pace and picking out great passes.

Ilori has that potential like Martinez and Busquets to control the midfield and allow us to play a proper Barca style 4-3-3. He would also provide pace and defensive ability to let Johnson and Enrique push up farther.

However, if Rodgers thinks he would progress as a CB more, I would be ok with that too. The kid is going to be great no matter where he plays.",0,1378421800,null,0,1378422712,0,cc2jb8a,t3_1ltbpf,t1_cc2jb8a,t1_cc2j1lz,null,1429576742,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

In retrospect I'm just a little bit bitter that in Series 6 they had to reopen all the storylines and make it more complicated, because 5 tied up all the loose ends, everything, it was great. Looking back on it, it sort of reminds me of Series 1 to Series 2: Series 1 made it all neat with Bad Wolf, left no major plotholes etc. and then they sort of tried to draw more into it with Series 2. The decision they made in both cases wasn't bad, it was still very good, but personally I would have preferred it if they hadn't made Series 6 quite as deep and meaningful as they had.

And then Series 7 came. On the whole, I thought it was quite good. The first half wasn't as heavily centred towards the finale like many of the seasons so far have been, and this had an almost adverse effect - I was affected by TATM a lot more than some other plot twists, because there hadn't been as much prophecy leading up to it, and it was more surprising.

Then, Series 7 part 2. Hmm. I was a bit sceptical (I never liked the new format, with 2 parts in a series), but I ended up really enjoying it. The new companion's interaction with the Doctor (and the T.A.R.D.I.S., haha) leant the perfect touch of campiness that a good companion should. Although I have to agree, if there was one problem with Series 7, it was some of the individual episodes (I frankly can't understand why Hide is getting so much love - it was okay, but hardly the best). On the other hand, none of them were *too* bad, and there were some episodes which were just amazing. I loved The Crimson Horror - probably my favourite episode of the series - as well as The Angels Take Manhattan and a few others (hey, I don't have a list of the episodes in my head).

As it happens, I've worked with 8-16-year-olds at an after school club (English and Maths) and have family who work in teaching as well (my brother works at a secondary school). 

So having 'a fairly good idea of whats involved', and obviously feeling the pressures of working long hours for very little pay, why would you want to make others' lives any more difficult?

Perhaps enough to allow the rebels to get the upper hand. If they get their hands on Assads chemical weapons caches are we honestly expected to believe they'll behave better than Assad is. Somehow I doubt it. 

If we put boots on the ground we could actually do some good in Syria by removing Assad, removing the bad rebels and secure the chemical weapons which is good for the world in general. Jihadists getting access to advanced chemical weapons would be disastrous. 

It's a shame we were lied to by Blair/Bush.. Now the political will isn't there to actually do some good.

For none techies the simple version of this is believe the hype. We are back to where we were with the out there nightmare scenarios in the first days of the Snowden leak. The NSA isn't simply collecting meta data on what we are doing, it is automatically, directly monitoring the content of all electronic messages that you send, email or otherwise and collecting metadata on all your digital activities. 

The US and maybe UK governments have been aggressively compromising large ICT companies either in negotiations or, when this fails, inserting or recruiting agents in them to spy on and even sabotage their work. They sabotage cryptography protocols by making random key generators less random. The mathematics of encryption remain sound but no closed source implemntation of it can be trusted.

For those of you wondering, a direct implication of this is that your bank account is not secure. The manner that this security is being exploited means that anyone can leverage the technqiues the NSA are using.

RvP is a monster of a striker -- none of his 3 shots were on target. To put that down to nothing but luck is a bit negative, I think.

Going forward, we were lacking. It's in this type of match that Suarez would have been a real menace. His trickery and work rate in place of, say, Aspas (who is a hard worker, but just doesn't seem like the goal-getter that Suarez is) would have been a huge piece of the attacking puzzle.

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-how-to-remain-secure-surveillance

For none techies the simple version of this is believe the hype. We are back to where we were with the out there nightmare scenarios in the first days of the Snowden leak. The *NSA isn't simply collecting meta data on what we are doing, it is automatically, directly monitoring the content of all electronic messages that you send*, email or otherwise and collecting metadata on all your digital activities. The US and maybe UK governments have been aggressively compromising large ICT companies either in negotiations or, when this fails, inserting or recruiting agents in them to spy on and even sabotage their work. 

They sabotage cryptography protocols by making random key generators less random. The mathematics of encryption remain sound but no closed source implementation (i.e. any company that doesn't let people see the code they yuse to build their software which is most of the big ones) of it can be trusted.

For those of you wondering, a direct implication of this is that your bank account is not secure. The manner that this security is being exploited means that anyone can leverage the techniques the NSA are using. I don't doubt more than few online thieves are currently going ""ohhhhhh, that's why it work!"". Some chunk of the up to £4.5 billion in the UK that get's half inched through online identity theft each year lies at the door of stopping terrorism. 

Another troubling aspect of this:
&gt; To help secure an insider advantage, GCHQ also established a Humint Operations Team (HOT). Humint, short for ""human intelligence"" refers to information gleaned directly from sources or undercover agents.

&gt;This GCHQ team was, according to an internal document, ""responsible for identifying, recruiting and running covert agents in the global telecommunications industry.""


So, somehow a large number of people in the IT business, possibly to the tune of 100s, are getting coerced one way or the other into doing the NSA's bidding and somehow it hasn't come out yet. Obvious tin foil hat is obvious here but how exactly are the people monitoring our day-to-day lives coercing many people to do their bidding (IT crypto and security people no less, who in my experience are often more than a bit keen on the whole personal privacy thing) and yet we've heard nothing of this till now?",0,1378425273,null,0,false,0,cc2kkx8,t3_1lsxce,t1_cc2kkx8,t3_1lsxce,null,1429576150,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

&gt;Those methods include covert measures to ensure NSA control over setting of international encryption standards,

The NSA has 2 parts, one part that trys to collect information and one part that trys to _protect_ information. Of course the part that works to protect information has a voice in international encryption standards, they also contributed lots of code to the linux kernel to all for more secure operation. These things have helped make peoples data _more secure_. These contributions have not weakened the standards (and at least in the case of AES have actually prevented a class of attacks).

&gt; the use of supercomputers to break encryption with ""brute force"",

No shit, this is the only way to break modern crypto. With sufficiently large keys and properly implemented algorithms brute forcing anything is infeasible, in fact with some systems and key sizes it will take more energy than is contained in the universe to decrypt your cat pictures.

&gt; the most closely guarded secret of all – collaboration with technology companies and internet service providers themselves.

Finally the dangerous bit. As I said before modern crypto is effectively unbreakable given proper implementation and sufficient key sizes. 

The main dangers are: 

* Misusing or incorrectly implementing the algorithms involved, this renders the encryption breakable to various degrees.

* Having systems in place at either end of the encrypted channel (your machine, your friend with whom you're communicating's machine or the servers hosting the service you are using is connected to.)

* Gaining access to the encryption keys after the transmission and using them on the encrypted data they have collected. (Though I would class this as a misuse or oversight as there are protocols that allow for perfect forward secrecy).

Please, to anyone with access to these documents, bring in a security researcher and have them sift through the documents and see if there is any information other than ""They're trying to watch you and the methods they're using are the ones that everyone knows about already.""

Edit: Apparently the Guardian do have security consultants helping on this. It just seems the documents don't actually contain anything that hadn't already been guessed. [Here](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-how-to-remain-secure-surveillance) is a good article by the man they have consulting.

Likewise if you hold shares which you plan to keep for the long term, then check their dividend record as it may be worth transferring them from your stockbroker account, and dumping them into your ISA.

Think of your ISA as a long term investment too, since interest compounds then the benefits of it just gets better and better.

As always [someone's written it up on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dialling_codes_in_the_United_Kingdom), to do a few quick examples the commonest ones are:

020 XXXX XXXX style numbers (not just London - Coventry has 024 now, for example)

0131 XXX XXXX style numbers (generally cities, like Edinburgh's 0131)

01472 XXX XXX style numbers (like Grimsby)

015396 XXXXX style (this is Sedburgh)

016977 XXXX style (Brampton) - note that this is actually a shorter number than most...

&gt;no closed source implementation (i.e. any company that doesn't let people see the code they yuse to build their software which is most of the big ones) of it can be trusted.

This is completely true, but not because of the NSA boogeyman deliberately weakening companies security, but because crypto is hard to implement and noone ever does it right. As an aside, verifying closed source pseudo-random number generators is perfectly doable, you can just look at the compiled assembly. Or because those providers have deliberately added backdoors into the system outside of the encryption system.

What everyone _should_ be doing is using standard privacy ensuring encryption _protocols_. The verification of the cryptographic primitives being standards compliant is simple. The issue is when people willingly lose fundamentally insecure protocols.

&gt; As was revealed today, the NSA also works with security product vendors to ensure that commercial encryption products are broken in secret ways that only it knows about. We know this has happened historically: CryptoAG and Lotus Notes are the most public examples, and there is evidence of a back door in Windows. A few people have told me some recent stories about their experiences, and I plan to write about them soon. Basically, the NSA asks companies to subtly change their products in undetectable ways: making the random number generator less random, leaking the key somehow, adding a common exponent to a public-key exchange protocol, and so on. If the back door is discovered, it's explained away as a mistake. And as we now know, the NSA has enjoyed enormous success from this program.

I was simplifying a wee bit but all those methods are open to being exploited by anyone, not just the NSA. Of the 3, the exponent is most troubling as it's the sort of thing a lot of freely available tech/maths concepts  could theoretically latch onto if you took a seriously mathematicaly minded chap and pointed him at the encryption protocol.

Also I will reiterate here what I said then ok?

The UK is one of 188 countries that have ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), the first arms-control treaty to introduce a verifiable ban on an entire class of weapons of mass destruction.
The CWC entered into force on 29 April 1997 and all Member States must agree to its provisions, which include:
to chemically disarm by destroying all stockpiles of chemical weapons, any facilities which produced them and any old or abandoned chemical weapons from the past never to develop, produce, stockpile or use chemical weapons submit regular declarations to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) on the production, processing, consumption, and import and export of certain dual-use chemicals allow the OPCW to carry out routine inspections on their territories The OPCW is based in The Hague, and has the mandate to achieve the object and purpose of the CWC, which includes an international verification regime to build confidence between CWC States Parties.
What does all this mean? The source is wrong. Any British company engaging in such behaviour would face incredible levels of criminal and civil sanctions.

I'm now downvoting you because, well yeah. This has been debunked. Thoroughly. Because the Daily Mail had to apologize, print a retraction and pay Britam Defence £100,000 in damages.

Arsenal have the starting 11 quality; then nothing. They have to play in europe and hope for no injuries, they're riding their luck and it would be annoying for them to get away with it. The only bonus is I have Giroud in my fantasy team. 

For us, I think if we can keep the team hungry, we can perform some small miracles. To be honest, if we don't slug it out with Arsenal and Tottenham this year, we may be in for a bad time later on. We don't quite have that ""Amazing player draw"" and Suarez is our only World XI calibre player, and he doesn't look to be staying here much longer.

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"We have had some terrible luck with injuries and Redknapp being linked with the England job, but things like that are part and parcel of football.  Managers can't expect their entire squad to be injury free all season long, nor to not encounter job speculation, whether it's being linked with another club, or being in danger or being fired.  Managing the squad's playing time and injuries, plus the external pressures of the job, are huge parts of the managerial skill set.  How many times has #WengerOut trended on Twitter in the last year?

And you don't think Arsenal have had a tough run with injuries and losing players?  Van Persie spent months at a time on the physio bed, has one great season and then gets sold to Man Utd.  They've lost Fabregas and Song to Barca recently, Sagna's broken his leg twice in the last three years, and Wilshire, Koscielny, Vermalen, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Diaby, Rosicky and Podolski all had extended stints on the sidelines last season.

The reason I state Wenger has been the compelling difference between us is that you can't be in the same job as long as him and have the same run of results on luck alone.  There are plenty of times his career has been in danger in recent years, and yet they always seem to pull out the results when they need them the most.  We haven't consistently done that.  When we needed wins late last season, sure we'll pull out a 3-1 against Man City, but then we'll go and draw with Wigan and lose at home to fucking Fulham.

Series 6 is less forgivable, Doctor Who tried to be serialized and failed miserably. Moffat overstepped his reach and ended up pulling yet another cobbled together duct tape over plot holes finale.

Moffat's big problem is that he has turned the characters into caricatures of themselves, The Doctor just quips 'X is cool' or 'Geronimo!' every other episode, River turns up to say 'Hello Sweetie, Spoilers' and flirt inappropriately.

I don't disagree that Liverpool can surprise people this season. We have the depth, and the players seem up for it so far.

This is our best year in the near future to really have a pop and get back into a properly threatening position.

true,hermithome,dalek,Dalek,"Yeah Moffat doesn't kill anyone off, not really.  
*The Doctor Dances*: Everybody lives. Literally, not only is everybody who ""died"" brought back to life, but that's the Doctor's actual line: ""Everybody lives"".
*The Girl in the Fireplace*: Died of old age.  
*Blink*: Died of old age.  
*Silence in the Library*/*Forest of the Dead* Every single dead person is resurrected in the computer.  

Series 5:  
*The Eleventh Hour*? Everyone who was in a coma wakes up.  
*The Beast Below*? Nope, everyone assumed dead hasn't actually died.  
*The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang*? No. Amy gets resurrected, Rory comes back to life, and the Doctor fake dies.  
There are a few minor legit deaths throughout Season 5 but none in the episodes Moffat writes. The only real death (of a named character lasting more than one episode) is Rory and he's brought back.  

Series 6:  
*A Christmas Carol*? Abigail. But she's a one off character and doesn't actually die in the episode. And again, it's of natural causes.  
*The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon*: Nope. There are minor deaths as plot points but we don't even learn those characters names.  
*A Good Man Goes to War*? It's a fairly bloodless war. Strax is killed but then promptly brought back from the dead.  
*Let's Kill Hitler*? Melody who regenerates. The Doctor is fatally poisoned, but then saved.  
*The Wedding of River Song*? Madame Kovarian. Only the whole episode is an alternate timeline that never happened, so, nope.  
Season 6 also has *The Curse of the Black Spot* where every person who is killed off turns out to have not actually been killed off.   

Series 7:  
*The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe*: Nope, no deaths. And an already dead person resurrected.  
*Asylum of the Daleks*: Yeah, Oswin's killed off. But she was actually dead before the episode started and oh, wait, it doesn't count because Oswin is Clara.  
*The Angels Take Manhattan*: No. Amy and Rory leave, but they die of old age.   
*The Snowmen* - Clara. Oh wait, she's in the next episode? Right, wibbley-wobbly timey-wimey.  
*The Bells of Saint John* - Nope, everyone taken by the GI is returned.  
*The Name of the Doctor* - Jenny, who's promptly resurrected, which is really a shame because that was an excellent death scene.  
Again, Season 7 has a few legit deaths but they're all minor and again, not in episodes Moffat writes. And there are episodes like *Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS* which undoes all the deaths in the episode and episodes like *Hide* in which no one, not even the ""bad guy"" dies.  
  
  
I have no clue at all why Moffat's in that picture. He's notorious not for killing beloved characters off, but for bringing characters back to life over and over and over, and for having deaths be off-screen and/or of natural causes. Seriously, this is a real problem that he has. ""Everybody lives"" is great when it bucks the trend (""just this once""), but when it's a pattern it's just annoying and it's indicative of the way that Moffat treats characters like plot points and not actual people. Sci-fi tends to have lots of deaths and Moffat bucks that trend at every possible point. Moffat is far more likely to bring someone back from the dead than he is to kill them.
