true,jdbu,null,null,"The big question is how do we go about controlling immigration properly?  On a pragmatic level, Britain is a small island, it is simply impractical to allow more immigration (with the exception of those fleeing danger and war zones on humanitarian grounds.)    Countries such as Australia have very tight immigration laws. They are a country with a low population and large landmass.  Britain is a crowded country with a small landmass.     The other problem, that new citizens from a different culture may in some cases have a greater number of children than the average Britain.    I do not think that would setting a cap would be an acceptable policy for many reasons.     It would be ideal if people living in the U.K as new citizens were aware that it is impractical to have more than British average of two children as the country will be overpopulated.   Surely it is in the new immigrants interests to have the cultural norm of about two children because they will be part of our country?   We will all be in the same boat.  An overpopulated country will be bad for everyone with housing, school and job shortages.   Their children will also face the consequences of overpopulation. 
The other point is that on the whole, Britain is a well integrated country.  We respect a great deal the cultures and religions of new people.  This ought to be reciprocated by in the form of realisation that new members of our society need to help by being aware that having more than two children will cause problems economically and overstretch the infrastructure of our crowded island.
