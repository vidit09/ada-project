At some point it was stated that Time Lord's only have 12 regenerations. Each regeneration's lifespan is longer than a normal human's life (9 stated he was 900-some years old); although they are not immortal as 1 regenerated due to his body ""wearing a bit thin"", i.e., old age. 

As the Time Lord's were able to grant The Master more regenerations it seems it was law, not biological, that limited the number. Without other Time Lords around, it seems reasonable that The Doctor currently has unlimited regenerations and unlimited lifespan.

Although, at least one Time Lord besides The Master is coming back in the Christmas specials; and Timothy Dalton is heavily rumored to play a second. If their civilization is rebuilt, The Doctor may come up against the limit again.

true,kencabbit,troughton,Troughton,"The general population in the Doctor Who universe want very hard not to believe. It's Somebody Else's Problem for them. From an artistic standpoint this allows the show to preserve that ""Holy crap you're an alien!?"" moment in successive episodes. This isn't reality, but it's just how things work in the Doctor Who Universe.

Torchwood wasn't created to expose aliens to the public, quite the opposite. It was created to eliminate supernatural and alien influence, and protect the public from it. So, the institute itself has good reason to be cloak and dagger. 

Jack Harkness himself is a time traveler who knows how humanity will emerge as a force in the galaxy. He's in no rush to usher that new era in, since he feels 'you have to be ready' for the changes coming down the pipe. He has no strong motivation to reveal to the whole world that there are aliens all over the place. Not before he thinks humanity is ready. From his point of view, he is a visitor--it's not his place to spill the beans to the general population, even if he gets involved and saves them on a regular basis. 

edit: .. also, The battle of Canary Wharf was covered up in large part. Mass hallucinations brought on by drugs, that sort of thing. Of course a lot of people didn't buy that poppycock, but those who just can't take it all in just can't take it and buy any cover story. I'll note that after the last Season Finale, it's very hard indeed for anybody on Earth to be in denial about their place in the universe... but some still are. 

edit1: .. also also, pay close attention to how the timelines match up.

The only thing you can do in the planning process if the council is supportive of the project is delay, delay delay. Unless you get councillors and/or MP's on side, they WILL be building those houses. 


The way we stopped the tesco from being built was to get a petition in our town centre, and organise a picket of the other tesco in town, forcing tesco to abandon it's plans. Unfortunatly when fighting an unnamed body, that isn't going to have and financial interest in whatever the hell you think, you don't really have a target to aim for. 


My advice, since you say this is on green belt land is to try and get the area listed as a heritage site, or if there is a good deal of animal life in the area, a site of special sceintific interest. However both these require a good ammount of time and effort, and may not prove possible. 


My advice, if you want to delay this project as much as possible (and if you delay enough the planners may abandon it and focus on somewhere else) is to: 

* Organise a petition, get local residents to sign up.

* Send the petition to everyone you can. MP's, councillors, local rag, etc. 

* Find out when the planning hearing is (if there is one) and attend, taking as many people with you as possible

* Lodge your objections IN WRITING to the council as soon as possible.

true,rtuck99,null,null,"I have some experience, not sure if it is relevant to your situation. I live next to a garrison (Royal Electrical &amp; Mechanical Engineers) which is due to be closed down. There is a [local/regional development](http://www2.wokingham.gov.uk/environment/planning/ldf) plan whereby central government has decreed x thousand houses must be built in the district in the next 20 years or so. Since the garrison is being closed down, the site is logical place for development, albeit the proposed site is significantly bigger than just the garrison (3500 homes IIRC), and parts of it are on currently undeveloped land.

However this is a several years down the road, but there have already been planning consultations held - I went to one after I made an enquiry about the status of it (I knew that this would be happening when I bought the house as it was common knowledge the garrison was marked for closure and I did a bit of research before buying), and got invited without knowing of the consultations existance.

Present were a number of council officials, planning consultants, residents from the various communities involved. Many of these had not seen the sites being developed first hand and we were taken on a quick tour of the sites. 

Basically, the number of houses was a given, but you do get some input into where things like schools, major roads, shops, etc might go. There was a mini-planning exercise where we were divided into groups to produce some broad-brush plans; this seems to have been positively received especially since local facilities are a bit lacking in our area.

According to one of the people I spoke to at the meeting, the limit before developers have to put in amenities etc. is set at 750 houses, so it may be that you won't get any - I would try and get them to have some put in. This is apparently one of the reasons why the planning department prefer bigger developments since they are unable to force the developers to put in schools etc.

I think the scope for changes depends on how far the proposal has gone, if it is still very early stages, then you have scope for a lot of input, there will probably be some consultation / planning meetings, especially if it is part of a wider long-term development plan for your area.

Since the number of houses being developed in the area seems to be pretty much fixed well in advanced, there isn't much chance of getting the number reduced without building more somewhere else in your district and simple NIMBYism isn't going to get you far.

I would try to get involved in the planning process as much as possible. If it is still early stages then you may have at least some chance of at getting some improvements to the plan.",0,1260746409,null,0,true,0,c0h5ebt,t3_adz1s,t1_c0h5ebt,t3_adz1s,null,1426156598,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; This campaign seems to validate the notion that the chart is somehow meaningful.

Does it?  I thought it illustrated how insignificant and irrelevant it is.  It reinforces the point that being ""Number One"" is a simple function of how many records you sold.  It's not about how good you are, how many people like and/or listen to your music, how many concerts you played, or anything meaningful like that.  It just comes down to how many records you sold that week.

Having a Facebook campaign hijack the hit parade is no different to having Simon Cowell and his music machine do it.  The fact that the track is nearly 20 years old makes it all the more amusing to me.  

But hey, each to their own.  I don't think I'll be participating in either of the sheeple campaigns to buy either record.  But I have to admit, I like the idea of Cowell getting one in the eye.  X Factor is, to me, the epitome of everything that is wrong in the music business. People who care less about music and more about being famous and/or making money.
