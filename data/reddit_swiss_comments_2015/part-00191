I'd love to meet someone who disagrees with the legalization of either and just ask them ""why do you care? why does it matter to you?"". In my opinion smoking a joint is about as harmful to your body as eating a jar of ice cream, or an alcoholic drink. If not immediately legalized, let's at least allow the research of its medicinal uses and why not allow it in certain clubs for 18+.
