That's true. But it's still not a fair system. For one thing, the way the credit system works is that you start by figuring what the US tax bill would have been if it all had been earned in the US. If your US taxes would have been higher, you still have to pay the extra to the US (and if your US tax bill would have been lower, tough luck). Second, the US and Swiss systems don't line up in terms of investment income: 1) Switzerland does not tax capital gains, while the US does, so you have to pay US capital gains taxes in any case; 2) as she mentions, Switzerland taxes wealth, while the US doesn't, so if she paid Swiss wealth tax (which admittedly only kicks in at a fairly high level of wealth) she would not get a credit from the US for it. 3) the US has these bizarre rules about ""Passive Foreign Investment Corporations (PFICs)"" which basically screw you over in a variety of ways if you invest in a non-US-based investment fund. I learned this after ten years or so of living in Switzerland and blithely putting a lot of money into Swiss (or Luxembourg)-based funds, then learning about the PFIC rules from my tax adviser.

1) She's a terrible writer considering she's a published author, and has written for the New York Times/WSJ. The piece read like an Easy Jet Traveller (in-flight Magazine) article.

2) Some points in the article are factual, but they fail to address the elephant in the room. That is, she’s comparing her life as an ordinary U.S Citizen living in the U.S, to that of an expat given the privilege to work in Switzerland (which it seems was afforded to her by her husband). 

It’s comparing apples to oranges. She makes it seem like the grocery worker in the U.S should consider quitting their job and look to move to Switzerland; the land of paid maternity leave, great work-life balance and high wages. Wrong. The very reason [the author] was able to experience all this was because [her family] was literally hand-picked to be here. 

I know a Swiss couple, where the husband was recruited by an American bank to live/work in NYC. He’s not coming back anytime either and has a long list of reasons why he prefers the U.S. Mainly, that he doesn’t agree with some of the very things the writer is celebrating.

The reason for the paid maternity leave? Taxes. The great unemployment benefits? Taxes.

She’s short sighted and needs to learn one of the basic tenants of Economics. “There’s no such thing as a free lunch.”

3) So a note to my fellow Americans. Chances you get a job in Switzerland that’s not in a very specific industry is slim. Chances you get a job as a writer (like the author) without the exceptions granted to her by her husband (I’m assuming Government/Bank/NGO) are pretty much non-existant. So before you write another (of many already written) posts bashing America, and expressing your desire to move to this socialist Utopia. Realize that it’s not as easy as the writer made it seem. If you’re keen on moving here, marry someone in an International Organization and start working on your resume.

The article contributes absolutely nothing to this sub, apart from informing us of something we all already know.

How does it have little to do with the rest of the article. When the whole article is written from a position of privilege?! Imagine if I wrote an article titled ""7 ways driving a Ferrari ruined a Volkswagen for me"". People WANT to work in Switzerland, they WANT to live here. The article might not be trying to convince people to move here, but it completely disregards the fact that most people can't. She writes her article picking and choosing what she wants to propagate. Why can't I be critical in pointing that out?

If her intention was to compare both countries. Fair enough. But my opinion is she's incredibly naive. 

With that said. My third point is something that I think majority of us share on this board, and something you referenced in your closing paragraph.

She had the classic experience when living abroad: You start to look at your own society differently. Everybody has this experience, also Swiss people who live abroad for a while.

Americans often do not look to other countries when solving their own problems, while I think that many countries solve a lot of things better than the US (but of course, also the other way around). If you're trying to solve problems you should draw from the largest pool of ideas possible and experiencing another society like the author did is a way of doing that. That way you can learn from mistakes and successes of others.

I don't think the article benefits Swiss people very much other than having our ego stroked once again. For Americans it might be a wake up call that things don't necessarily have to be the way they are at the moment and that the American solution isn't necessarily the best one. The article says little about what actions an American should now take. It seems like you take away that they should just move, the other commentator takes away that things in the US should be changed. Either one doesn't seem very realistic because of Swiss immigration policies and the US system basically being broken and taken over by big businesses.

To me, as long as people learn about different solutions in different countries they gain some perspective on their own lives. Maybe Swiss people stop complaining so much, maybe Americans start to think why it's so hard to pass such policies in their countries.",null,0,null,1437556950,null,0,false,0,ctbxib6,null,t3_3e5ljn,null,t1_ctbxib6,null,t1_ctbx88r,null,null,null,1440467535,null,6,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,6,null
