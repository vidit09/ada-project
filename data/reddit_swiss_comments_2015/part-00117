Guns are designed to harm and still our homicide rates are extremely low.

As I said, feel free to start gathering signatures and try to change tha law or else go live in the UK or Australia is you are so paranoid about people owning guns.

&gt;Yeah, see, this is where you should have paid more attention in statistics. You can't just take random numbers and assume causation. Swiss homicide rates most likely low DESPITE high gun ownership. Having access to guns means that people in e.g. emotional situations can cause a lot of damage quickly.

There's no correlation at all between gun ownership rates and violent crime. More guns don't mean more crime as well as more guns don't mean less crime.

The fact is, we have a low crime rate despite owning many guns. So I don't know why you are crying about this.

&gt;How is that related? You're just a selfish asshole. You should move to the US and join the tea party idiots.

I'm selfish? I'm not the one that wants to forbid people from legally owning guns and destroy a proud sports shooting tradition because of ""MUH FEELINGS"" and paranoia.

If you are Swiss maybe you remember Knabenschiessen and Feldschiessen? Maybe you have noticed the tons of gun associations that exist throughout our country?

Here an [article](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/18/gun-ownership-gun-deaths-study) about it. For example, if only makes sense to look at gun related crimes, not homicide over all.

Honestly, it's almost offending how stupid you are.... So if I shoot you in the head then you would be okay with that because our homicide rate is low, right?

Yes, you're putting other people in danger just because you think you need to shoot at other things. Play fucking video games or what ever kind of hobby, there's no need to own a gun unless you're a hunter or a police officer or so.

I never said that but a gun is designed to cause harm. It's also totally irrelevant that you like this kind of activity. I guess my favorite sport is throwing hand grenades in crowded train stations then. So should we allow that too?! 

&gt; The problem arises when those weapons are taken out of the safe environment of a shooting range, and in a more mundane situation.

I agree.

&gt; That's where I see a problem.

I agree with that too. But then you can ask yourself the question why we even allow guns for normal people because no matter what you do there's always people that won't handle guns responsibly. There are people that might buy a gun while everything is fine but years later develop psychological problems. Then you end up with crazy people having guns... great...

Okay, I had a little sarcasm going on there which may have been non-obvious. But the important point is, it shouldn't matter what something was designed for. It should matter more what you use it for. A lot of things are like that. Nuclear energy is the best known example, I think.

Neither is the primary **use** of weapons.

With cars you can do that (not only for having fun, but for helping the economy). You just have to have insurance. Otherwise why would you allow 2 tons faster than a horse in public?

Oh, and there are people who think 0.5 promille alcohol level is okay while driving, just so you could have a little fun. But enough car analogies, I think they are bad analogies.
