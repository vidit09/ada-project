I also think that if the government is rendering services to the people, it's also the people that should pay for them. Of course I am not against some corrections like progression etc. because some can contribute more than others, but in principal I think this rule should hold.

null,false,b4silio,vd,Vaud,null,"Hey there,

The train system is based on the itinerary, and not the time-schedule/train type you take, so if you take a ticket Geneva-Interlaken, you can take any train that goes there, or (mostly) any combination of trains to get you there. The trains you actually have to book in advance are rare. (The glacier express you need to book if you want to be sure you'll have a seat).

If you take the day passes, you just hop onto any train. (Small exception for some trains in very secluded valleys, but it's quite rare). As for the individual prices, the sbb.ch website is crap, but to my knowledge it's the only way to get the price. You just have to click on ""purchase ticket"" and it will tell you the price.

If you plan on traveling a lot in 4 days, you may consider purchasing the Halbtax (Demi-Tarif) which is half off any ticket. It's CHF 175.- (for a year) so you might be better off with the 4 days pass. (Geneva - Interlaken round trip is 142 CHF, so you will quickly go over the 213.- price if you do one or two more destinations).",null,0,null,1434301571,null,0,false,0,cs6afjw,null,t3_39tg2g,null,t1_cs6afjw,null,t3_39tg2g,null,null,null,1436993610,null,4,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,4,null

Yes, it's the same (if not a bit more) as our GA travelcard just way cheaper. You can use pretty much any train (with the possible exception of some small local  private train lines) as well as most public transportation such as buses or ships.

The most notable exceptions are cable car up to mountains. And even there you can get discounts with it a lot of times. And the other being the night lines which run on weekends after about 1 AM. These special services may require some additional fee which normally are around 5 CHF.

You're welcome. I hope you enjoy your stay in Switzerland.
