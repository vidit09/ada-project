That is exactly the point I'm contesting. All the countries would have done better without austerity (except for the higher debt accumulated).

While increasing debt is a problem, it is a small one because of the negligible cost because of the low inflation.

Very rich country, one of the highest standards of living in the world. If I remember correctly it's considered by research to be the best place to be born, best place for expats, and the happiest nation in the world, as well as many other great things. Very beautiful country and high in tourism. We have lots of lakes and mountains, and for a relatively small country, the weather and climate is fairly different in different regions of the country. The two major cities are Geneva and Zurich, and then we have big cities like Bern, Basel, Lausanne, Lugano etc... We have 4 national languages, Swiss German, French, Italian, Romansch. We have 26 cantons, which are similar to states in the US. We have a strong democracy where swiss people can vote often. We are surrounded by Italy, France, Germany, Liechtenstein, and Austria, the biggest border is Italy to the south. We don't have the sea, but driving to it isn't that far, and we are centrally located in Europe, and the world really, which is good for travel. We voted not to be in the European Union, so we have our own currency, not the Euro, and a few other things. We are neutral, so we don't take parts in wars or conflicts, but all Swiss men must do army training for a few months (not you don't worry). People are pretty humble and shy sometimes, but it depends on where you are in the country.

I don't know where in Switzerland you're from, so that changes some things. Usually it's considered that the french speaking side (Geneva for example) is more liberal, and more international (Geneva has the UN, ILO, Red Cross, WHO, WTO, etc etc etc), and some very very top universities and schools. Culture changes depending on where you are.

The food is good, but fairly simple. We're very famous for Chocolate (Toblerone, Lindt, etc.) and Cheese (Fondue, Gruyere, Raclette etc.). Again, it's a very international place.

Of course it is. It's all about the principles we build our country upon.

&gt; The Problem with todays society also is that everyone automatically assume they have a right of everything.

One of the principles is individual freedom and equality under the law. Marriage for homosexuals is a logical consequence of these principles. Unfortunately it also gives the freedom to provoke others. And it goes both ways. There are tons of anti-gay rallies all over the world (and even in Switzerland some times) and teens call each other 'gay' to insult each other. It's all in their rights to do so. Do you want to take away these rights of freedom of expression?  
So some homosexuals are flamboyant. I don't like that either. Most of them however do not attract negative attention and what does it say about us when we punish a whole group for the actions of a few?

You ask why they don't celebrate the civil union. Would you celebrate to be a second class citizen with limited rights? It's not that everybody has to use the rights they have. We both probably don't make use of all the rights we have. However I'm still glad that we have them and I think we all should have them.

&gt; You can't reach the full equality so lets just invent unions for them so they can tell the government they belong together because Marriage is more than just love.

What's marriage in your opinion then? Aren't we talking about the legal definition and about the rights the government gives to people that are married?

&gt; What is with Catholic and Protestant church? Do they have to change their constitution then? They are non-government organizations, will the universum implode then?

Nothing is with the churches. They can continue marrying people. I already said in the last post that the crazy thing about this is that nothing changes for traditional marriage.

&gt; I would got really angry about this court-decide, I mean the politics of the United States couldnt even debate about it.

Well, this won't happen here, because Switzerland does not have a Supreme Court. Highest instance is the parliament in these matters and there will always be the possibility of a referendum. The US Supreme Court only takes cases that they can interpret using the US constitution. Apparently they have found that the US constitution grants the right for marriage to both heterosexuals and homosexuals too. Laws against their marriage would thus be unconstitutional.  
Most of their decisions are based upon principles. The principles that are written down in the constitution. There are a lot of people that think that 'the mob' should not decide on the rights of individuals, but that they should be decided by the government on principle.

You can't say they didn't debate this however. The debate has been going on for years. Most states already legalized it, which gives an indication that most states would have also voted for it if there would have been a vote.",null,0,null,1435674771,null,0,false,0,csnjtsc,null,t3_3bakq9,null,t1_csnjtsc,null,t1_csnh30m,null,null,null,1437463230,null,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2,null

So... what is there to say about Basel that isn't on its wikipedia? 

* The stairwell by Johanitterbrücke smells like pee.

* Kannenfeldpark and St. Johannspark were both originally cemeteries. Kannenfeldpark still feels like one and gives me the creeps.

* The bar with the latest hours in Basel is Friends Bar. It closes around 5am, which is conveniently when the first trams start running. 

* There's a nude beach on the Rhine between Schwarzwaldbrücke and Wettsteinbrücke. Divert your eyes when Rhine swimming unless you like seeing fat old 70 year old men.
