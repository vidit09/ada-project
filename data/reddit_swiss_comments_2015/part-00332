There are basically four options: Doing the army, doing civil compulsory service (might be a nice source of income in the summer months of your studies abroad, especially when they give room and board. But you'll ahve to qualify to become a soldier in order to apply), civil protection (for those medically unfit to become a soldier, but fit enough to serve somehow) and medical leave. A medical leave is kinda easy to get, but you'll have to pay 3% of your income or 400 bucks each year for 10 years.

If you move away, you'll lose your C permit once you are out of the country for 180 days within 365 days. That will likely happen. I am unsure if you can keep it during your studies, where you keep a residency in Switzerland, but I wouldn't bet on it since it's being out of the country that counts AFAIK. So getting citizenship now (remember it takes a while to process) will have you on the sure side.
