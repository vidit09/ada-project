Also, I'll point out a bit of a counter point and not just question yours, that the top paid CEOs earn what the market and owners of the company allow them to earn. If they are limited to 1:12 then they will leave to other companies that can pay them what they are potentially worth, as the companies these guys run generate billions in revenue and profit, so why shouldn't they be paid rather large sums?

If talented CEOs leave Switzerland for higher paying companies then that puts at increased risk the future of the company, faith of investors etc... Of course people would run the company for a lot less if they had the choice, but if they were any good, they'd soon be picked up by a foreign company who could pay them 10 times their 1:12 salary.

Minimum wage is pretty easy to predict. Very little would happen aside from the bottom 10% getting a significant boost. Hardly anyone gets paid below the 22.- that's proposed, so it would just be a blip on most businesses' balance sheets.

Mincome is a bit harder to predict, especially since clawback isn't specified, so when it's being discussed nobody's entirely sure what's being discussed. Taxes would go up, probably mostly negating the benefits, depending on how much you already make, which would probably annoy the really rich, and benefit the bottom 10% while leaving everyone else mostly the same.

1:12 gets harder. Do a bunch of companies just leave Switzerland? Does it affect income in overseas labour? Or do they just figure out some loopholes and nothing happens at all, or worse if those loopholes work, does it end up making things worse for people? While 1:12 seems to be a great idea in principle, it strikes me as one that could backfire.

The public transport system, as often as I curse it, is pretty amazing. I can get anywhere in Switzerland in a matter of a few hours, and therefore meeting up with friends from any corner of Switzerland is no problem. The major problem is the never ending price-augmentation.
