The way I see it, there's two way to go at this: 1) Have this sub be a ""outside communication and news"" thing like the epfl.ch homepage (which afaik almost nobody uses) or 2) Make this a community driven thing for students by students, maybe have the AGEpoly promote it in some way if we can get more than the current ~4 persons here to actually submit stuff. Seeing as there are around 10k students, I'd imagine a 500-1000ppl subreddit by the end of the year is not unrealistic, provided we do things right. 
A good thing to do would be introducing this subreddit to class delegates (or however this tranlates to english?) and see if they wish to promote it as a communication tool for their class. I think a separate post to discuss the role and use of the sub would be pretty useful, I'll probably write one in a short while. 
Also, an important thing : private subreddit ? I'm guessing some people might not want to have to switch accounts or be extra careful not to share personal information or whatever. Topic to be discussed I guess. 

Other than that, the current ""active members"" are essentially 
-Protectator
-Eternahl
-Lachainone
-Aethec
-Me

I guess we have to figure out how this thing is managed and its promotion together ? I.E. Synchronize FB posting and other stuff. Also, if any of us ends up class delegate or happens to be a friend of one, that'd help inmensely.

That's a very good point. If we want honest discussions about stuff, throwaways/multis or a private sub is required.

I think throwaways are a better solution for a few reasons:

* Adding people to the private sub would be extremely boring and slow - can you imagine getting 1k mails from EPFL students asking you to grant them access?
* This sub should also serve as an ""ask EPFL students"" sub, IMHO (it's too small to create a questions-only sub), which is not possible if it's private. Honest Q/As like ""what do you think about optional course XYZ?"" should be possible.
* Getting professors/TAs/... on here might be nice; or, at least, allowing them to participate in conversations. We don't want the EPFL to think this is some secretive place where we say bad stuff about it.

I'm not offended (you're not obliging me to do it!), I'm shocked. I mean, these things were pretty common in the '50 and our mothers and grand-mothers fought a great battle to give us freedom and dignity for what we are and not for being the ""wife of"" and allowed us to work in fields before considered only for men. So, I'm surprised that someone wants to do something like that instead to study any other thing and build her own life independently of her marital status. In 2013, we have women who direct nations, corporations, go in the army, go in the space, etc. etc..it's very difficult for me to imagine someone who dreams of being a perfect wife.

&gt;Me [24/F] with my husband [30/M] of 6 years, wants me to get a large tattoo of his name, should I?

&gt; submitted 2 days ago by Pshan2121

&gt; So My husband wants me to get a large tattoo of his name, written in the Arabic alphabet (We are Muslim), down my rib cage, or down my upper leg area. He has mentioned it for a few years, but lately he is all about it. He says that I would be a bad wife if I did not do it. I don't want to be a bad wife of course.

&gt; I dress very conservatively in public so no one would ever see. I don't know what to do. I don't want a tattoo. They scare me...it is just so forever and on your body. I know a husband is forever too, it just feels different for some reason. The name thing makes me feel like he owns me a bit, like I am property. I mentioned this to him, and he told me I am his property, but in a joking way. So everyone what do you think?

&gt; tl;dr: Husband wants me to get a large tattoo of his name, says I would be a bad wife if I did not, I don't really want to, what should I do?
