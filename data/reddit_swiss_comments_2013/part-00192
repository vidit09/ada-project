Within Switzerland? Do you realise how small Switzerland is? North South extension is about 200 km, East West is about 350 km. A plane can fly at about 800 km/h meaning if a plane were to take off at ZRH and be hijacked it would take less than 15 minutes to reach any given target within our borders.

I don't think anyone could intercept that plane in time, even if you had jets capable of flying at 3000 km/h once you realise it's hijacked there's nothing left to do.

In that link you provided the fighters intercepted the plane at 11:24, about TWO HOURS after last radio response. And they couldn't do anything about it, the plane crashed shortly afterwards.

Generally speaking, we let civilian planes do as they please, but military airlifts/transports are generally not permitted (exceptions being humanitarian relief operations, sanctioned NATO/UN missions we ""agree"" with, etc.).

Of course, when you have rules like that, you have to enforce them, otherwise why have them? So our Air Force does random (or sometimes not so random, if our intelligence services know something) ""inspections"" of planes flying over Switzerland. Say for example that Skyguide Zurich has an incoming flight declaring itself (on the radio) as an Airbus A321 flying from London Heathrow to Milano. We have no idea whether that's true - you can't tell by radar. So we send up two fighter jets to check. They fly up to the unknown plane and identify it (make, model, registry number, airline, etc). If all's well (99.5% of all cases, I would imagine), they land again. However, there have been cases where the innocent Airbus turned out to be a military transport plane headed for the Middle East, or North Africa. These planes are then forced to turn back, as they are not permitted in our airspace.
