The public transport system in general is one of the best of the world (I assume). Basically you can go from anywhere to anywhere by train/bus/tram etc. Trains are usually very clean, quite comfy and on schedule. For all public transport connections use www.sbb.ch (as mentioned by barlavon). There's also a smartphone app for that.

Switzerland in general is more expensive than the US for sure. I think Zurich is the second most expensive city in the world (after Oslo). And as has been pointed out by barlavon, Saas Fee is probably pretty expensive as well. I haven't been to Saas Fee myself, so I can't really speak from experience, but I'm sure the average costs of living are higher than in the US.

That being said, I would take the first year easy, be prepared to fail some if not all classes as you adjust to language and country.

Be prepared for the beginning times to be extremely hard, you will get homesick and the thought of quitting will be an often one. If you're the kind of person to give up easily I would not attempt this. If you can go through with it, in the end, it will pay off since you will be fluent in a new language, have experienced a different culture and can visit a lot of the neighboring countries.

I would prepare with basic Italian skills, try www.duolingo.com for some free training and buy some books. You should be able to communicate basic things, though nowadays almost everybody speaks at least basic English.
