Of course, this was a winter experience. Cannot vouch for it being as incredible in the summer. Probably a different kind of incredible. For this American, it sure felt, in winter, like we were in the forest scenes of Disney's Beauty and the Beast.

The Grindelwald area was pretty beautiful, too. Of course, if you visit Eiger, you'll be there already!

Edit: If you're a Sherlock Holmes fan at all, you should check out the Reichenbach Falls. They aren't too far from Grindelwald if you're already there for Eiger (maybe an hour's drive?). We didn't get to see Reichenbach because it's apparently inaccessible in winter.

**Edit 2** If I may suggest, if you're near the Geneva area and are willing to drive a little bit, and want a really nice, quaint restaurant that is not at all touristy, try visiting Saint Cergue's Restaurant du Jura (http://www.restodujura.ch/).

On the way to Lugano you could consider a quick stop at Como / Lake Como, although view around Lugano is absolutely amazing.

* Don't go through the Gotthard tunnel. It's a boring 16 km straight in a dark hole. At least go over Gotthard pass (above the tunnel, serpentine road, actually doesn't add more than 15 min, especially when there is heavy traffic at the tunnel). Sadly, this is one of the *worst* passes. If you don't have the time, take at least the detour over Sustenpass (amazing) and then Brünigpass back to Lucerne.

* Grindelwald / Lauterbrunnen area is a must

* Thun is nice, Berne is spectacular. If weather should be bad skip Thun and spend some time in Berne with good restaurants, museums and Europe's longest outdoor (but covered) medieval shopping arcades (called *Lauben*).

Of all the lakes I personally love the Lac Leman (Lake Geneva) the most - it is stunning on a warm summers day and given that you are planning to go through Geneva anyhow, I suggest maybe stopping there for a swim  - I'd suggest [geneve plage](http://www.geneve-plage.ch/) for it.

I also have to second what someone said about the Rigi, it gives you stunning views of Switzerland on a clear day. You can go up or down (but I suggest up) the Rigi with a [nostalgic steam train](http://www.rigi.ch/de/navpage-SteamWVR-SteamMtTransportWVR-53657.html) - I recall if you booked well in advance you could reserve seats right behind the locomotive.

Also if you are a big hiking fan, go to the Valais - there are plenty of beautiful places to go and see - I used to go there hiking every summer and sking every winter with my family when I was younger and I can't say it has done me any harm.

St Gallen is another cute town to visit - the people are lovely there and you could go see the [Stiftskirche](http://0.www.alpen-guide.de/m/image/db/4308117.jpg) and the [Stiftsbibliothek](http://raoufselmi.ch/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Stiftsbibliothek-St.-Gallen.jpg) - both of which are part of the UNESCO Worl Heritage.

Another UNESCO World Heritage Site is the [Lavaux](http://images.gadmin.st.s3.amazonaws.com/n7182/images/detail/366544_Lavaux.jpg) near Montreux and relatively close to Geneva - I have to say it is one of my favourite places here and still captivates me everytime I drive through it - also when you are in the area, Montreux is also well worth a visit (it's where the annual [Montreux Jazz Festival](http://www.montreuxjazz.com/) takes place and it also has a cute wee [castle](http://www.studylingua-sprachaufenthalte.ch/de-wAssets/img/franzoesisch-staedte/montreux-big.jpg) right at the side of the lake).
