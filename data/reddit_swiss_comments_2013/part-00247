Get your groceries before 8pm. Don't write times like 8pm, write 2000 instead.

Being a Swiss-American living in Lucerne I'd be happy to grab a beer for some small talk in downtown ""Lozärn"" :-)",0,1384909773,null,0,false,0,cdifcn3,t3_1r0o08,t1_cdifcn3,t3_1r0o08,null,1428588752,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
true,stabmeinthehat,null,null,"Definitely look at Verbier. It's considered expensive but that's mainly due to accomodation costs and swanky après ski bars/restaurants. Lift passes and food on the slopes are not noticeably more expensive than anywhere in Switzerland. It's almost always sunny and has great skiing - including some blacks if you want a challenge but plenty of great reds and blues for you and your gf to enjoy.

Champery is part of the huge Portes de Soleil area, so would have more to offer for your skill level but you would not make the most of the other linked areas in 1 day but it would be a good option if you plan to ski multiple days, returning to GVA each day.

Chamonix in is in France, around 1.5hr from Geneva and also worth a look, especially if you like the idea of skiing on the legendary Mont Blanc.

All of the places mentioned offer stunning scenery, the train ride along Lake Geneva and then up to the mountains between GVA and the Swiss resorts is stunning.",0,1384910118,null,0,false,0,cdifi45,t3_1r0s6p,t1_cdifi45,t1_cdif2xn,null,1428588681,2,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,2
true,CatnipFarmer,null,null,"Thank you for the advice. I'd thought about Verbier but it looks a little further away than the other places that were mentioned. I've done the train ride from Geneva to Brig several times, I agree that it's really lovely. 

I assume that the easiest way to get to Chamonix is by bus from Geneva? ",0,1384916400,null,0,false,0,cdii9b1,t3_1r0s6p,t1_cdii9b1,t1_cdifi45,null,1428587395,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
