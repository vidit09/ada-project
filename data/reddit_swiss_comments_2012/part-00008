But I see it very unrealistic for a country like the US to adopt this policy. The neutrality has a lot to do with self-defense. Switzerland is unable to promote its interests with any other ways than with negotiations, we are simply to small to impose anything on other countries. A good example is the second world war (eventhough there we're made horrible mistakes). Switzerland was surrounded by fascist nations and still managed to not get invaded, because we didn't chose sides. But hell no, i don't wish the US with its powerful economy and its powerful military acts neutral towards dangerous gouvernments like Iran or North Korea.

Very important is also the humanitarian mission of our foreign policy. But the amount of help by Switzerland is so small, recieving countries can only be chosen, not forced to fulfill some standarts. I wish our politicians can threaten a country like Uganda to cut the money as David Cameron did after Uganda threatened to make homosexuality a major crime.

How I see it, the US should continue with the line Obama took. Ron Pauls idea is crazy and dangerous for the rest of the world. I actually care if Iran is able to nuke Israel. Nobody wishes back the foreign policy of the Bush administration or the (un)necessary involvment of the CIA in several countries during cold war.

I don't have quite the same view of what is a democracy and what not. Going by the definition of the word, democrazy means ruled by the people. There have been attempts at legitimizing the EU as a democratic institution by retroactively letting the people 'decide'. It failed multiple times and always instead of respecting the people's opinion they simply passed it anyway in a different form. 

&gt;I tend to favour ""Verfassungsgerichtsbarkeit"" as checks and balances over direct democracy (or a direct democracy that has itself to be checked before a constitutional court - else stuff happens like the ""Minarettinitiative"" and other potentially unlawful stuff). 

Well I don't. Why? Judges are humans - and often they're also party members (even worse). It's so much harder to influence a majority of the people in a negative way than it is to influence a few judges.

**edit**: About the ""Minarettinitiative"". Yes that was unfortunate. But honestly I don't believe that (a) this law actually does anything unconstitutional and (b) I don't think that the damage is that big. I firmly believe that if the initiative would have been to forbid mosques it would have never passed. See the Schwarzenbach initiative in the 80ies for example. As with any system silly laws will happen. I don't belief that truly dangerous laws have a realistic chance here though. 

&gt;I know my view is not popular. However, I am quite certain there are good reasons why our system of direct democracy works rather well:
1.) size of the country (I do not believe it would work in bigger countries - there would likely be stagnancy and potentially an (undemocratic) rule of some social/ethnic etc. majority

I don't see why a direct democracy coupled with a strong federalistic principle (do not centralize what doesn't have to be, give as much autonomy as possible to communal, regional and national authorities (in that order)) could not work in a larger system. We simply don't have any precedences for this. 

&gt; 2.) our wealth. I don't buy the argument that this comes from our system of direct democracy. We have been and are just really lucky and we have gotten incredibly rich after WWII (remember, only 110 yrs ago the poor - quite a problem - would still try to get to the US). which allows us to continue to be so (by great education, economic incentives etc.etc.).

It's certainly true that you need a well educated demos for this to work. However our education doesn't stand out that much in international comparison. Europeans would be more than enough educated. Also don't forget that cultural mentality is a huge factor. I know Japanese mentality pretty well for instance (I'm married to it ;) ) and it wouldn't work there IMO. But most of the Europeans are quite individualistic and I belief a majority of Europeans to share a certain mindset (not wanting the authorities to interfere too much with their own decision while maintaining law and order). 

&gt; The ACTA debacle is not happening because of politicians are afraid of their voters, it happened the way it did because of our legal traditions that were considered and upheld. 

And where are these legal traditions coming from?

It simply isn't that big an issue in Switzerland (the trust in gov. not to do anything wrong with data - the trust in gov. on the whole - is very strong).

The US is, and has been the most powerful economic, diplomatic, and military force on the planet since WWII.  This power and mobility has alowed them to be a shining champion of democracy, humanitarianism, and freedom the world over.  Of course, there have been many regrettable blunders when this power is abused (Iraq, the shady dealings of the CIA, maybee Iran... we'll see).  

The US is capable of leading by example and of intervening in humanitarian and military crisies, only because of its wealth and might.  

Switzerland's situation cannot be compared.  Much is made of Switzerland's neutrality, but we can't forget why this neutrality has worked for centuries; a combination of diplomatic neutrality and military hyperpreparedness.  Switzerland may have had some shady dealings with the Nazi's (like allowing german materials to pass through to Italy), but there is a good reason that Germany didn't simply take over.  After all, Switzerland would have made a hell of a lot more convenient of a staging ground to invade france than Belgium was.  

Invading Switzerland would have been so horrifically costly to the Germans that they did not consider it (incidentally this is also why Switzerland was not used to invade France in WWI).  Switzerland is covered in hidden pillboxes, tank barricades, bunkers, bridges rigged to blow, etc.  

But this extremely disproportionate military might is not designed to operate outside of Swiss boarders (except for that one time in lichtenchtein), and as a result, cannot participate in nationbuilding, humanitarian aid, etc.  It is a reasonable and sustainable foreign policy for a nation as small as Switzerland, which at times has been surrounded by hostile powers.

There is just one thing, though. I would never buy condoms, where they are easily accessible to people, like in a supermarket. When we were younger, I heard one of my schoolfriends brag about him using needles to make hole through the condoms. Stupid and idiotic, I know. But who knows who else had this idea as a kid?    
    
That's why I buy my condoms always in a drugstore or sex shop, where the boxes are not just hanging in a rayon, easily accesible for idiots.
