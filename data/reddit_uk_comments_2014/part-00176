true,Grimlyn,null,null,"I was told a while ago when I complained about it that these are actors. Their jobs last a month maybe a few days at most. Unless specified in contract, they get paid once and get no royalties from most movies. Their sustainable income is from doing things like this. Hence, Billy Dee Williams, kinda a dick at cons. The only real work he can get though that pays is giving autographs at numerous cons.

edit: I really thought about this a bit more. I see the person maybe once or twice in a great show and they make a lasting impression. I enjoyed what they did and can only wait to see them in something else. Even though my 40 fee to get to meet the person may be split up between his manager, agent, venue people, and him...the portion that I gave of my 40 pays for a meal for him/her to eat, or a moment of fun in his/her life for the moments of joy they've given me with thier skills of acting which not everyone can do well at all. I paid for the privelege to meet the person, shake their hand or get groped, tell them what I really felt about them and what their role means to me and they leave with a meal and a good feeling that what they are doing matters to people years from the mere days they spent on one simple performance.

This is the exact reason we don't see Brad Pitt, Harrison Ford, etc doing many cons. They don't need the money that bad. I almost feel that the resentment toward the A list actors gets taken out on the B, C, and D listers by their fans too much sometimes. A grumbly Billy Dee is understandable if he hasn't had an actual acting gig that pays well in a while and he only gets recognized for being the smooth Star Wars guy.

Things weren't going well, the Chinese just weren't engaging.  At the official dinner in Buckingham Palace during the visit the Queen asked the PM/ Minister how it was going and was told ""not very well"".

Sure enough, ice broken, trade deals negotiated successfully.

There's a lot of things about Britain I like, and a lot of British cultural products I like (of course they appeal to me, I'm British.) 
At other times seeing the country being idealised can be very annoying, because I actually have to live here every day, and so I have to deal with the fact that life in Britain can be as full of stupidity and irritations as life anywhere else. Also I find the idea of having a -philia for any nation slightly absurd...

true,jbubermensch,US,usa,"I'm American, from New York. My dad had a job in London for about 10 years, so my family lived there on a permanent resident basis, though we were all still American citizens. While over there my sister and I were both born, and we lived in Chelsea for the first 4 years of my life. As soon as my Dad noticed that my sister and I were starting to develop English accents he decided it was time to leave (also, coincidentally, he got a promotion that put him back in New York), and we moved back to New York where we've lived ever since.

I was too young to remember much about living in London but my parents told me we had lived in Chelsea and told me about the club, so I always knew I was a Chelsea fan but not necessarily what that meant.

My earliest memory of the club was at around 7 or 8, when my parents told me we had gone to a fair few matches back when we lived there. I excitedly asked them if Chelsea had ever played United since they were the only soccer team I had heard of at that point. I cringe every time I think about that now.

Besides that, I remember seeing us play Milan in the Meadowlands when I was 12 or 13 which would've been around '05, and we won handily, I think I remember it being 4-1. Which sparked my interest in Chelsea as Milan were another huge club at that point and I wasn't aware of the brilliance Mourinho was bringing to us at the time.

Since then I've followed Chelsea to increasing degrees, and in the last 4 or 5 years have become a really dedicated fan. Following Chelsea sort of feels like a link to my English-ish past, so it's actually become a relatively big part of my identity.

 I live in California now for school but I try to see every match despite the ridiculous times, and the ones I miss I nearly always watch later.

He made me start playing FIFA's Road to the World Cup 2006 and we played the shit out of that game. It was a lot of fun, but I still wasn't budging on actually watching/enjoying the game.

Fast forward a few years and we were still playing the shit out of that game and he started following Chelsea because he caught a Champion's League game randomly on tv. So of course we always played as Chelsea and smashed all of our friends. I ended up man-crushing on Torres so of course he became my favorite player when I FINALLY started to come around a little bit.

Some of the greatest players to play in England have played in red and they are very proud of their history.

However, they've lost much of their glamour recently and their fans are considered somewhat maudlin and rooted in past glories (and tragedies).  Heysel and Hillsborough disasters were a total kicking for Liverpool and they've never yet recovered.

**Man U**:  Seen as the standard bearer of the glory hunter.  They've won consistently for 20 years and been at the forefront of the EPL revolution.  Thus, have courted and attracted TV fans from all over the world.  Other fans of other clubs see them as soulless.  Whether you consider that true or jealousy is moot.

**Chelsea / Man City** The two clubs who ""won the lottery"" in that a big, filthy rich, foreign investor decided to throw swimming pools of money at an EPL team for reasons have having too much or wanting to buy profile.  Again, having so much money has meant they've attracted great players and played great football but they had to sell out to a certain extent to get there. Without their rich backer, most think they'd sink back to a lower level like the Blackburn Rovers of the 1990s.

Both have pros and cons with what you start with. For example, Series 1's crappy effects could put people off.

If you're a bit of an idiot and forgot to watch anything until just a day or two before series 8 begins so don't have time for Matt's era, watch Doctor Who: The Ultimate Guide (2013) (The 2 hour one!). It's basically a documentary covering as much as possible up to the 50th. Then watch the 50th and Time of the Doctor.


Alternatively, you could start either right at the beginning or with the 3rd Doctor, at Doctor Who (1963) 7x01 Spearhead from Space. I wouldn't recommend this. The Classics are better to be watched after you're a fan and know the series IMHO (especially with series 8's premiere closing in).

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;The American revolution was a political revolution, not a social one. The economic system did not change in the US, and unless you were a loyalist you were welcome to keep your property.

Ah, so you mean revolutions are okay, so long as the ideals for which the masses fight are kept on the leash of rich slave owners who conspire to prevent any real democracy resulting, because they know what democracy means for them?  Working men and women who fought for the ideas of the likes of Paine would ultimately see their hopes (and later their rebellions) crushed and see the same established hierarchies mirrored in the US as had been under the British, with their own State and landowning aristocracy.

&gt; The life of the average homo sapien has never been more comfortable, more safe, and more healthy than it is today. If you look at history, the progress of the human race (in terms of quality of life, or technological change, or 'progress' generally really) stayed at 0 for about a million years, shot up radically upon the invention of civilization, and then climbed slowly for about 7,000 years until the end of the renaissance/age of enlightenment, where it began a spike that continues to this very day. In everything from childhood mortality to access to food and clean water, to rates of murder and death the statistics have gotten radically better. 

So you believe in progress?  Great, so do I. I guess neither of us are proponents of the fascist philosophy of eternal return.  But I hope you're not about to try to sell me Pinker's claptrap, or to lay it at the feet of the capitalist heroes of capitalism...

&gt;40 years ago under Communist regimes, the vast majority of Chinese were poor farmers, labouring away for 15 hours a day on Collective Farms, under the whip of one of the most oppressive governments in history, one forged in the fires of a Marxist Revolution. Today, the average wealth of a Chinese person has shot up. Though their conditions may still be bad compared to ours, access to food, housing, consumer goods and even the quality of state-owned services like healthcare, has shot up unimaginably. Objectively, the average Chinese citizen has a far higher quality of life today than before 1970. Unsurprisingly, the spike in living standards coincides with the introduction of free market capitalism, as it has in Vietnam, East Germany, Poland and many other countries. 

Go elsewhere for a comprehensive defence of Maoism, because you're not going to hear it from me, nor even for any form of 'authoritarian Marxism'.  I'm only sympathetic to the ideals of communism as an aspiration for a post-scarcity society.  However, it does bear noting, as Nobel prize-winnng economist and famine specialist Amartya Sen did, that: **“compared with China’s rapid increase in life expectancy in the Mao era, the capitalist experiment in India could be said to have caused 4 million excess deaths a year since India’s independence…India seems to manage to fill its cupboard with more skeletons every eight years than China put there in its years of shame, 1958-61”** - and that continues right up into the '90s at least.

Add to that, that even anti-communist sources like Pew are forced to [acknowledge that there is widespread discontent with capitalism in ex-communist Eastern Europe](http://www.pewglobal.org/2009/11/02/end-of-communism-cheered-but-now-with-more-reservations/).  The best are qualified successes, but many are [failures](http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-tragic-failure-of-post-communism-in-eastern-europe/23616) and death rates in, for example, Russia have soared as a result of neo-liberal policies and the social and economic problems which have resulted.

&gt;How you can despise a system that has brought you so much comfort (from medicine developed by capitalist companies to the computer or phone you're typing this on, to the food you eat), including this very website itself, which by the way is owned by Capitalist Corporation Conde Nast, seems very strange. Millions of people are still lifted out of poverty by capitalism every year.

I, along with Marx, recognise that capitalism has had a hand in development and modernity, and that it is very good at certain things (such as mass production).  It may have been necessary, but then so may have absolute monarchies, feudalism and slavery - are you going to praise them too and claim for them everything which happened during their tenure?  Do you wish that they had continued?

Technologies which currently exist exist, and it's impossible to know whether they would or would not have done so had we taken a different economic path.  Certainly computers, the Internet, many components of modern medicine, etc., were 'R and D'ed, funded and sometimes developed with massive involvement from the State and with enormous input from working people (sometimes working in socialist/communist fashion - take a look at your average Silicon Valley start up). People are lifted out of poverty every year under capitalism, how many more would be so under a different economic system?  All we know is that the numbers of poor continue to grow and that society becomes more and more unequal as that is what capitalism does (as demonstrated and evidenced by Piketty).

&gt;Leftist governments have a solid death toll-

Really?  There's a huge amount of propaganda in the figures - including those from ""communist"" sources - and a wide variation in those reported.  But certainly, much more has been done to identify and calculate the death toll of communism than that of capitalism.  So much of the latter is indirect, hidden (deliberately or otherwise), at a distance, by proxy, and most of all slow and continuous rather than in hot revolution.  But how many would you accept for the Iraq War?  Probably not the million plus that the left, with considerable justification, argues.  How much for the slave trade?  Would you even accept that as capitalism? (Because it was).  The First World War?  Arguably the Second?  Would you hold the UK's hands up for its undoubted complicity in the murders of a million plus in Indonesia under Suharto, and the myriad other cases where we deliberately launched vicious dictators' careers to serve our imperial, neo imperial and corporate economic interests?  Our many wars of aggression, on our own, with or through our allies, proxies and strategic partners?

When the whip is withdrawn, it's usually the end of one's career as an MP, because people will so rarely vote for an independent (and withdrawal of the whip means he can no longer stand for the party). 

The tories will be reluctant to withdraw the whip from Fabricant because the London headquarters of the political parties are dependent upon the local associations for their grassroots support (and for fundraising, organising stuff, putting up posters &amp;c). 

Not only is Fabricant (apparently) a very good constituency MP - that is to say that he's good at intervening and being helpful when people (in Lichfield) write to their MP with local complaints like it's taking too long to get an operation on the NHS - but his seat is also a very safe Tory seat and he's been there over 20 years.

That is to say - Fabricant is very popular with the local tory voters and Conservative association.

I assume the phrase ""withdrawing the whip"" comes from a historical meaning of ""the party whip will no longer try to tell you what to do"", and that this has simply always meant that the party will pick another candidate for the next election, because the party wants backbench MPs they *can* boss about.

*The years have made me bitter*     
*The gargle dims me brain*     
*'Cause Dublin keeps on changing*     
*And nothing stays the same*     
*The Pillar and the Met have gone*     
*The Royal long since pulled down*     
*As the great and unyielding concrete*     
*Makes a city of my town*     


*Fare thee well sweet Anna Liffey*     
*I can no longer stay*     
*And watch the new glass cages*         
*That spring up along the quay*       
*My mind's too full of memories*     
*Too old to hear new chimes*     
*I'm a part of what was Dublin*     
*In the rare old times*     


I just feel that we're being thrusted into radical changing in an inorganic and unnatural way.  The city centre, in my opinion, should expand and develop organically, and, with the scale of changes proposed in this plan 10-20 years seems *far* too soon.  Maybe in 50 years, but certainly not just two decades.

Who's to say the 'chess piece' mentioned in the article won't fail?  If John Lewis does set up here, we'd have three (four if you include Smithfield -- which, I should add, used to be a main shopping hub of Belfast, and isn't even mentioned in this fella's restorative plans) shopping centres within the space of fifteen minutes of one another: CastleCourt -- lower-end; Victoria Square -- higher-end; John Lewis -- higher-end?  Who are we supposed to be attracting here?  Are we helping local people with local needs?  

It's *our* city centre, not the 'thirty something' and 'European' migrants that are mentioned in the article.  I personally know quite a few people who've not even shopped at Vicky Square due to the steep prices: how much of a 'success' was it truly?  We fail to even fill quite a few lots there and at CastleCourt, too, mind.

Just look at the Obel as an example of a poorly implemented building that, to me at least, is a bloody eye-sore and in terms of investment has done sweet fuck-all, too.

Those student art galleries that he talks about?  Why can't we restore North Street Mall to its former glory?  Isn't Uni of Ulster planning to set a campus right beside North Street?  Doesn't this make logical sense?  Regain the character/culture of the local buildings whilst simultaneously fulfilling the practical needs of *the people*.  But, no, that'd cost too more than building eye-sores across the Lagan I'm sure.

Like I said, maybe I'm just being a typical auld knob, but I feel we're going to lose a lot of our character through such sudden changes and it annoys me.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Events under the First, Second and Cold wars were as much the fault of our Feudalist, Fascist and Communist enemies respectively, as they were of Capitalism.   Had you actually read Pinketty, you would have seen how WW1 and WW2 were disasters for entrenched Capitalist interests.  Indeed war between Western nations today remains almost impossible precisely because of globalised capitalism.    Discontent with Capitalism in some formerly Communist countries has to do with a number of factors, such as the loss of national pride and the fact that they are so corrupt that they cannot really be described as capitalist in the sane sense as us.  People always think the grass is greener.  In a similar way India cannot in any way be dismissed as a failure of Capitalism.  Its founding fathers and the congress party elite were all socialists in the Bevanite fashion, and while they did not wish for immediate expropriation of all business and land they introduced massive regulatory systems, stifling and inadequate social programs, and a bureaucracy unrivalled by any other Capitalist nation on the planet.  In addition, India remains in many parts almost a feudal country, backwards and unchanged for many centuries.  Its failure cannot be chalked up to capitalism in any meaningful way.  India was aligned with the USSR for a decent chunk of the Cold War actually.  Indeed only today is Modi really introducing proper capitalism to India, which is why many have high hopes for him.  Deaths that occur under Liberal Democratic governments that happen to allow capitalism cannot be counted under its death toll.  These wars are started for a number of reasons, not all of them capitalist and not all of them accepted or supported by capitalist leaders.  By contrast under Communism and Fascism, everything is under the state, so the susym takes direct responsibility.It is certainly possible that Capitalism will be looked down upon many years from now.  I personally believe it will outlive its usefulness at the end of scarcity.  Even then, however, I think any remotely educated person will see it much like they should see Feudalism or absolutist monarchy today- a necessity under which some suffered, but the human race was also advanced.  Especially in the UK, which is only able to maintain its high living standards because of capitalism, given that we have minimal resources naturally, criticising the system is biting the hand that feeds you.  As hard as it is to accept, we are ALL the global elite in the UK and we would likely suffer tremendously if the global economic system were to change.   Perhaps you are a selfless saint.

There was a war of independence,  as a result of this war a referendum was carried out with regards to independence, this referendum resulted in overwhelming support for independence for the entire country.

The ulster protestants threatened violence if they were forced to live in a catholic dominated irish state. So the island was partitioned into Northern Ireland and the Republic so that ulster unionists could remain part of the UK. However gerrymandering occurred in the formation of Northern Ireland to provide the new state with land to support itself.

The formation of northern ireland meant that two nearly equal in size groups (in later years) with long histories of violence were effectively chained to each other. Add into this the fact that irish catholics were discriminated against for many years and you have the context of the Northern Irish conflict.

So the UK is only responsible for Northern Ireland as a constituent.

I'm most interested the coaching situation in the UK, specifically coaches holding Uefa's A, B and Pro badges. The ratio of one of these coaches to players in England is 1 to 812 compared to 1 to 17 (Spain), 1 to 48 (Italy), 1 to 96 (France) and 1 to 150 (Germany). Bear in mind this information is a couple of years old, but the gap will not have closed significantly to not still be an issue. 


This highlights the *massive* importance St. George's Park will play in the future. I'm in no way shape or form a fan of the FA, who, IMO, are a shower of cunts, but they deserve a serious pat on the back for finally doing something about the institutional failure to utilize English youth. They have finally noticed that relying on clubs to nurture youth is obviously wrong. Clubs have agendas and when managers, and to a lesser extent owners, arrive and leave via a revolving door there is no guarantee youth will stay on the 'to do list'. 


But this is the looooooong game. The fruits of this vastly expensive labour will come to fruition in 20 years, maybe less, maybe more. I believe its worth it though because a country as footy mad as Britain should have more Sterlings and Barkleys coming through.

He's sneaky as fuck too. Carefully going back over his own comment history and deleting anything that may hinder a future argument. So when you call him out on his Islamophobia he says ""who, me?! I am against *all* religion"". But Google doesn't let you simply delete the past like that Fineus.

So when you find a comment like [THIS](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1my9fw/what_do_women_who_wear_the_niqab_think_of_the/ccdq6g8) where someone has gone back to remove themselves from the conversation so they have some deniability later, Google has already crawled the page and [saved the posters name](http://i.imgur.com/L2eANgT.png) for posterity.

It is true of course that you will find less discrimination and under-representation in fields where there's a very limited pool of applicants due to the skills being very rare. You can't hire your friend to be a brain surgeon or a top footballer and hiring someone who hasn't done much networking is better than hiring nobody. 

The thing is most people do not work in super high tech industry or as a footballer, so your statement doesn't really apply to the country at large. Being on TV isn't exactly a skill that only a few hundred people have, it's something a sizable minority of people could do. Therefore it's easy to discriminate and still fill the roles. 

Just because a business (you're only talking big publicly traded businesses here, a business that is privately held can have any number of motivations aside from profit...) only cares about making money doesn't mean the humans working there are soulless robots. Hiring managers have opinions and they are emotional creatures. They will hire someone they know and trust rather than someone with a weird-sounding name. This is how the real world works, we're not discussing football teams here.

The trouble with this kind of free-market libertarianism is that it's a simple, comprehensible, compellingly beautiful idea that empirically *just doesn't work*.

The libertarian theory relies upon:

* Perfect knowledge of the market (impossible)
* Perfect freedom of movement and no geographical restrictions on choice (unrealistic)
* Perfect rationality by consumers (ridiculous)
* For consumers to dedicate significant time to researching and thinking hard about (not to mention *re-*evaluating in case a better deal has come along or something has happened that changes their moral calculus) every trivial decision in their lives (unreasonable)

... and even then fails to account for simple, straightforward problems like inherent barriers to entry for certain industries/businesses, protectionist and exclusionary business practice by existing market leaders and the inevitable emergence of natural monopolies in many areas of industry.

The problem with Libertarianism is that it relies upon every consumer to make every decision in the long-term best interests of society as a whole, when humans *demonstrably, probably* often have trouble making decisions even in our **own** best interests.",0,1403347249,null,0,false,0,cid867w,t3_28jom3,t1_cid867w,t1_cicedyj,null,1434336922,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I view them like I view the really far-gone weeaboos.

That said, I know people at my Uni who were into typically Anglophile shows and grew out of their crazy fangirling once they got here and went back into Japanophilia again, so...

I just hate the sort of Anglophilia I see around that consists of 'All hail BBC' and 'British accents are amazing and I want to marry a British boy because Benedict Cumberbatch and Harry Styles'. I don't really mind the moderate and genuine interest people might have outside popular BBC fandoms, but I've yet to see lots of it that isn't romanticised rubbish. If it isn't the Tumblr brand of Anglophilia, it seems to be obsessions with red phone boxes and the Queens Guard, or sticking the Union Jack on everything and using it like associating yourself with the UK makes you edgy, intelligent or interesting.

My main gripe is that every time I've met a proper fangirly Anglophile in person, I've felt like I don't really matter to them because I'm not from London. The really crazy ones seem to buy into this thing about London being the ultimate England and everywhere else being just decoration to make London look nice on the map. Say you're from England and they go mad about it, but answer that you're not from London and you don't really care about the Royals and George, and you lose their interest. Why consider yourself an Anglophile if you apparently have no knowledge or interest outside the streets around Westminster?

And then there's the arguments I've had with people trying to tell me the slang they've learnt is widespread in England, as if only a teenager in Ohio knows that 'blimey hell' exists and someone from Britain can't possibly know without doing the research. It's as if they forget the UK is a real place where people live and not just a floating base for the BBC and men in bowler hats.

From a left perspective, fascism is just a highly authoritarian form of capitalism, and the fascist dogs are released by capitalists as a last gasp to defend it when capitalism goes into one of its periodic crises and revolution threatens.  There's good evidence from history that this has generally been the case.

&gt;Had you actually read Pinketty

Piketty or Pinker?  And yes, I'm aware of the destruction wrought by the two world wars to many entrenched capitalist interests - there is not a single unified elite though, and in many senses, capitalists are never happier than when they are devouring each other.  On the other hand, arguably the wars also served to save capitalism from its own contradictions and from consuming itself earlier.  But the point here is not to argue that the wars were objectively beneficial to capital and capitalists, or even that they desired the war in order to profit, but to argue that their roots are capitalist and that they were wars of capitalism - just as booms and busts are intrinsically part of capitalism but not necessarily desired nor beneficial (except to some).  The First World War had many and complex proximate causes, but, undeniably, the distal economic factors, grounded in the contradictions of the capitalist economic system at that point in history were of greater significance, because, in a very real sense they lie behind those more immediate causes.  Similarly WWII was not so much about the mistaken appeasement of a mad Austrian with ambitions of global domination, but about the economic conditions capitalism had caused in Germany (and elsewhere), and the response of capitalists to this crisis, which was [not so much appeasement of Hitler but collaboration with him as a bulwark against communism and social revolution in Germany](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t82AZTdXcyI).

&gt;they are so corrupt that they cannot really be described as capitalist in the sane sense as us

Do I smell a 'no true Scotsman'?  Corruption is part and parcel of capitalism.  It may be part of the human condition too, to be honest, but certainly capitalism is no defence against it because capitalism demands a hierarchical State and concentrations of wealth that give it a breeding ground.

&gt;Deaths that occur under Liberal Democratic governments that happen to allow capitalism cannot be counted under its death toll. These wars are started for a number of reasons, not all of them capitalist and not all of them accepted or supported by capitalist leaders. By contrast under Communism and Fascism, everything is under the state, so the susym takes direct responsibility.

This is a cop out.  We live under a capitalist economic system with capitalist States, both are responsible for the deaths which result from their activities and operation. It's true that the less the people are involved in genuine democratic decision-making, then the less they are culpable, but the State always is for its own actions, be it public or private.  Outsourcing your dirty work to other private actors does not remove your responsibility in any meaningful ethical sense, and even the capitalist law recognises this to a degree, for example, with contract killings.",0,1403348361,null,0,false,0,cid8c2b,t3_28mnpw,t1_cid8c2b,t1_cid7szz,null,1434336998,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Duggan died from a gunshot wound to the chest. **The circumstances of Duggan's killing resulted in public protests in Tottenham which, fuelled by poverty and racial tension, led to conflict with police and escalated into riots across London and other English cities.

East Belfast, the generally Protestant part of the city, has more housing space than West Belfast, the generally Catholic part of the city. This is due to bigger families among Catholics, historical sectarianism in housing planning and Catholics being pushed out of Protestant areas. The result of this is that immigrants are generally moving into Protestant areas and so Protestants feel under threat.

Northern Ireland has a sad history of thugs putting people out of their homes. Communities feel there is nothing unnatural about putting someone out of their home if they are unwanted.

Due to the pressures of the troubles, some communities in Northern Ireland have very strong identity. They feel very strongly about being able to get housing in *their* local community rather than going to outsiders. To this end, I think that there is something to the argument that this isn't racist.

It sounds like there's nothing particularly complicated in your affairs so things should just sort themselves out.

Your employer may already have taken the correct amount of tax from you via PAYE, depending if they got a correct tax code for you from HMRC in time.  You should have been given a form P60 showing how much you earned up to April 6th and how much tax and National Insurance has been taken.  You can estimate how much income tax you should've paid by subtracting £9440 (your ""personal allowance"" - the amount you can earn income tax free) from your gross pay and multiplying the result by 0.2.  So for example if you earned £12800 gross you should've paid approximately £672 in income tax; if you've paid more than that a refund may be due.

HMRC review all accounts over the summer once they have all information from employers and should get in touch if you've overpaid.  If you try to contact them now there's a good chance they'll ask you to wait until September and get in touch again if you think there's still a problem.

You are not required to do anything with the P11D other than hang on to it for your records.  It's a copy of information your employer has also supplied to HMRC so it should all be taken into account.  The exception to this is if you were required to do a full tax return where you would need to include the information from the P11D, but from what you've said you don't need to do a full return.",0,1403351022,null,0,false,0,cid8qm8,t3_28o5o9,t1_cid8qm8,t3_28o5o9,null,1434337189,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

Muslims in this country are hugely varied, from mates of mine who drink alcohol and take drugs but weirdly won't eat Pork to men who expect their wives to wives to wear hijabs. Unfortunately outsiders that criticizes Islam are quite often criticized by Muslims on both ends of the spectrum and branded a haters or racist. Islam has a problem with being told that maybe some of what they are doing is wrong.

Strangely can't find this story on any other paper. Probably because the story is seriously anti-Islamic. Lets assume broadly the facts are right as it's still published.

Ignoring the obvious outrage, I'm willing to believe the court that actually he was so naive and ignorant and purely a product of his upbringing that he really could not be held fully accountable for his crime.

The only logical conclusion if you accept that mans defense is that we might just have a serious problem with religious fundamentalism in this country.

We have to accept that it's OK for women to wear hijabs. Ok for them to be forced into arranged marriages and to live a life as a subservient house wife so as not to shame the family. All of this and much more so as not to offend the moderate majority. I know we just made a law against forced marriages but frankly if your family tells you they will disown you it doesn't matter much what the law says.

Religious belief should not preclude criticism.

Kanin of Purdue University investigated the incidences of false rape allegations made to the police in one small urban community between 1978 and 1987. He states that unlike those in many larger jurisdictions, this police department had the resources to ""seriously record and pursue to closure all rape complaints, regardless of their merits."" He further states each investigation ""always involves a serious offer to polygraph the complainants and the suspects"" and ""the complainant must admit that no rape had occurred. She is the sole agent who can say that the rape charge is false.""

&gt;The number of false rape allegations in the studied period was 45; **this was 41% of the 109 total complaints filed in this period.**[16] The researchers verified, whenever possible, for all of the complainants who recanted their allegations, that their new account of the events matched the accused's version of events.

I decided after the last election that i'm going to vote Labour, but now I'm not so sure. Some of his policy ideas put forward in recent months have been worrying. 

1. Freezing energy prices temporarily? Yeah that won't work, prices will be manipulated before and after the freeze to account for the shortfall. Infact they already started doing this by raising prices ~10% at the end of last year. It's an ill thought out policy which will not have the intended affect of reducing the cost of living. More robust regulation needs to be put in place, and permanantly linking a proportion of energy prices (After overheads are covered) to wholesale gas prices would be a much better route to go down.

2. Denying JSA for 18-21 year olds unless they have attended higher education? I think they need to make higher education compulsory and/or examine secondary education before they do that; they are basically saying that GCSEs do not provide the skills required for employment, which does raise a few questions. (I personally disagree that this is the case, but if the government is saying it is a problem, I expect to see some course of action to tackle it).

3. Furthermore, means testing JSA based on their parents combined income of £42,000? That's insane. I don't have the figures to hand, but that must rule out at least a third of people within that age group, effectively mandating that parents have to look after their children financially until they're 21.

4. Compulsory Jobs Guarantee for people claiming JSA for 1 year, paid for by a tax on bankers bonuses? Sounds great, but there is going to be a massive funding shortfall here as the tax on bankers bonuses is earmarked for about 20 other policies as well.

When you combine point 3 and 4 you get a problem; if young people can't claim JSA benefits because of means testing, they can't be classified as being out of work for long enough to be eligible for the jobs guarantee.

For example, we put a maximum cap on bonuses. A bank like HSBC just pays its people by giving them money offshore. We go after HSBC for doing this, they shift their base of operations out of country and we loose the tax revenue.

Really?

Nothing stopping them ruling extraterritorial laws are invalid for football.

&gt;Well that's the IFAs own fault, but my point still stands, they wouldn't have been selected if the FAI were capping players based on whether or not they have a Nationalist or Unionist background.

The Irish teams of the 80s were a different situation to what we have now. NI were the stronger side back then so Kernaghan was the exception that proved the rule. Now we have the FAI approaching catholic players who would figure in our plans and aren't even making the bench with their adopted side.

&gt;I would *love* to see a source for this. Although I do agree that John Delaney is a weasel.

Radio interview during the CAS process.

&gt;If that was happening then Nationalist players such as Neil Lennon, Chris Baird, Sammy Clingan, Shane Ferguson, Paddy McCourt, Ryan McLaughlin and self-confessed Republic fan Niall McGinn would never have made themselves available for the NI team. If the IFA hadn't dragged their heels for so long about symbols you'd have more Nationalist players turning out for NI.

Players care little for symbols. They'll choose whatever path is seen to aid their playing career. The symbols are about support and the simple fact is the current selection of Northern Catholics with no living link to the territory to the South is having a detrimental effect on the quality and diversity of our team

&gt;No they're not, neither are republican symbols. The Celtic Cross, Shamrock and Harp are well known as cross community symbols.

Yeah right. I like them personally but many loyalists do not, because of their usage as Republican symbols. I'd class them the same way as GSTQ on the other side, but taken together they are who we are.

&gt;If the IFA were that worried about the NI team/identity being somehow ""diluted"" then they wouldn't have capped so many foreign-born players. How would the mutual eligibility proposal be detrimental??, they'll still be pulling on an NI shirt at the end of the day.

Foreign born players should be fine provided they fulfill the parent/grandparent rule on birth in the territory. Then teams would not be encroaching on each other so directly.

&gt;That's because the IFA never had a case to begin with. Their whole argument rested on a ""gentlemens agreement"" that allegedly existed between the FAI and IFA, the IFA were asked to produce evidence of this agreement and they didn't. that's why the CAS and FIFA ruled in favour of the FAI.

Actually it was the FAI who asked for this agreement in the 1950s to prevent IFA poaching *their* players. Ironic they'd go back on their word when it suits them. But typical double standards from that organisation, and bewildering that FIFA thought cementing this situation was a viable 'solution'.

&gt;Since you like the IFA seem to be reluctant to compromise then you have no right to complain when a player switches.

The 'compromise' would not solve poaching, it would exacerbate it. Why would anyone who has a problem with the FAI accept it?

&gt;How is it??, the point I made is that genuine NI fans are being made to suffer because the IFA are being incredibly bitter and about the whole situation; they created the situation and then complain when it comes back to bite them.

As stated, the FAI *asked* for the IFA to stop choosing Southern players. The IFA complied and the selection of southerners stopped. The IFA are protecting the sanctity of their own jurisdiction and the support want them to do more not less.

&gt;End what little cross border cooperation there already is between the 2 associations??, yeah that's a great idea! /s.

It is. End joint youth training camps and any hint of a return to Carling cup rubbish. We have nothing to gain from it.

&gt; A 2005 study, ""A gap or a chasm? Attrition in reported rape cases"" was the largest and most rigorous study to date commissioned by the British Home Office on UK rape crime, from the initial reporting of a rape through to legal prosecutions. The study was based on 2,643 sexual assault cases (Kelly, Lovett, and Regan, 2005). **Of these, police departments classified 8% as false reports.[12]**
&gt; 
&gt; The researchers noted that some of these classifications were based simply on the personal judgments of the police investigators and were made in violation of official criteria for establishing a false allegation. Closer analysis of this category applying the Home Office counting rules for establishing a false allegation and excluding cases where the application of the cases where confirmation of the designation was uncertain **reduced the percentage of false reports to 3%**. The researchers concluded that ""one cannot take all police designations at face value"" and that ""[t]here is an over-estimation of the scale of false allegations by both police officers and prosecutors."" Moreover, they added:
&gt; 
&gt;   The interviews with police officers and complainants’ responses show that despite the focus on victim care, a culture of suspicion remains within the police, even amongst some of those who are specialists in rape investigations. There is also a tendency to conflate false allegations with retractions and withdrawals, as if in all such cases no sexual assault occurred. This reproduces an investigative culture in which elements that might permit a designation of a false complaint are emphasised (later sections reveal how this also feeds into withdrawals and designation of ‘insufficient evidence’), at the expense of a careful investigation, in which the evidence collected is evaluated.[12][13][14]

if we don't buy strikers when they're in a good form, i.e. after an amazing season, when should we buy them? Even though it's his first *great* season (and they are many reasons for that), it doesn't mean we have to wait another season before buying him just so he confirms (or not) his quality. 

That'd be very dumb on so many levels. First if he confirms to be lethal, we'd have to pay a lot more to grab him. Also the opportunity cost: who would we (Chelsea FC) then buy for the striker position? There isn't that many choices (Mandzukic and Balotelli are the only ones that come to my mind). To wait another season before buying a top quality striker and go on with a Torres/Eto'o/Ba/Lukaku front would be suicidal, both for Mourinho as a manager and our ambitions as a club. We cannot wait one season more! We have been in 'transition' for so long that we need to make this summer transfer count.

As for Mandzukic and Balotelli, the first one would be good for us I think but Costa is typically a Mourinho player and we all believe (by observing his qualities) that he'll fit very well at Chelsea. As for Balotelli, I'm not a fan. When you see that Man City got rid of him, Milan can't wait to get rid of him, you have to ask questions. 

In conclusion: Costa is the most obvious choice by taking all the available information into consideration. Of course there's always a risk (that he'll be a Torres), but this risk is minimal in comparison with the other choices, i.e: buy no striker (Torres, Ba, Eto'o, Lukaku), buy Mandzukic or buy Balotelli.

The reason why it was set up as National *Insurance* scheme is to maintain incentives for working through providing benefits (unemployment, pension, bereavement) to those who've contributed to the insurance fund. However much some employers might want to increase wages if taxes were reduced, you could never be rid of unemployment/bereavement/ old age. So how would it reduce reliance on government for those taken out of the NI scheme? 

If unemployed, they would have to be supported solely from government handouts with no contributory basis. What about state pensions, which are also based on NI contributions - where is the incentive to work and progress if the contribution-link is removed? Not to mention the financial implications of removing a significant amount of the income of the state pension. 

If you're in support of reducing reliance on government, surely you should be in favour of increasing the link between how much people work and the support they should receive?

true,hybridtheorist,null,"Leeds, YORKSHIRE","&gt; The accuser could be someone known for lying, for false accusations of many things including rape, even if they haven't made it to the police before

But, I'm not sure how having people completely unconnected to the case knowing her name and going to the police saying ""oh yeh, she's a liar"" is going to make much difference. hell, even if ten people go to the police saying she is a liar, the police should still investigate properly, it's not really a ""boy who cried wolf"" scenario.  
Obviously, they should bear that in mind, but just because someone's said it before, doesn't mean it's true this time. 

&gt;  Being a rape accuser should not ruin a persons name in a community, this isn't the victorian era.

That's not really the issue though. I think it's more ""I'd rather not let the entire world know I was violated by some guy. I'd rather not go to the police, than speak out and have that in the papers.""  

Imagine if the girls who accused Stuart Hall were named, and their names were in the papers, would that stop them coming forward? At the very least, it can't help.  
Who'd want everyone at the supermarket/pub/party knowing that the Union President/Stuart Hall/Julian Assange/some random guy had raped you?

although having said that, there's some part of that ""well, Ben's a good boy, he'd never do that, and she's a slut anyway..."" or ""that's the bitch that led Ben on then cried rape"". You can't deny that occurs. Especially in a case like this, where people may think ""Ben's not been charged, therefore she made it up"", which isn't necessarily the case at all. 

To paraphrase what you said; Being accused of rape should not ruin a persons name in a community, this isn't the victorian era.  
If it does hold true for accusers, why shouldn't it for the accused? Obviously it is awful for the accused, but you can't say that life just continues as normal for any girl who comes forward. That's simply untrue too.

I know that happens to men accused of rape (guilty or not) too, and it shouldn't, but as I say, there can be some positives. I'm not saying I'm in favour, just that it's not a one sided argument with no upsides, the way the men of reddit make out.

It worked, but now you have less and less barca players and the newer generation don't play tiki-taka day to day.

Possession football isn't tiki taka. Bayern under Heynckes used to dominate posseion but weren't tiki-taki in their approach. We more often than not have the more possession and we haven't been playing tiki taka. The ability to play possession football and how you use that is what defines the playing philosophy. Hodgson doesn't know how to play possession football. He plays reactionary, direct football. It's why he failed in the top jobs(Liverpool, Inter, Blackburn at the time) and why he does so well with smaller clubs and nations like Fulham, WBA, Switzerland at the time.

Yes we shouldn't bench him but he can't come in and expect to be first choice.

I'd put Lukaku as second choice striker or rotate him during FA cup and what not, or when Costa is injured obviously etc. He (Lukaku) should get a lot of time because we have so many matches.

Of course last season Lukaku choose to go out on loan, he wasn't forced as he first claimed to be. If he had stayed, he would've been our first choice striker because Eto'o, Ba, Torres weren't up to par. Of course hindsight is 20/20 and I don't blame him. Because at the moment of his decision, he had in mind the World Cup and wanted to play as many matches as possible.

But if he now thinks he could come in as first striker, he's delusional (understandably, he's young). I hope he stays and fight for his place, all the great strikers have thrived under competition. 

edit: btw, mourinho won't be blackmailed by him, so if he thinks he can bully his way to be first strike via interviews/media, he's dead wrong.

Holy shit. I can't believe something like this is being upvoted. Are you really so clueless about the Republic of Ireland that you can just freely pull things like that out of your ass without thinking?

[Here are the 2013 statistics on world gender equality, compiled by the World Economic Forum](http://www.theguardian.com/news/womens-blog/interactive/2013/oct/25/world-gender-gap-index-2013-mapped-iceland-uk).

As you can clearly see, the Republic of Ireland was ranked 6th in the world in terms of gender equality in 2013, compared to the UK's 18th place ranking.

Sure, there is work to be done in terms of legalising abortion, but the fact that abortion is still illegal is simply a relic of the Catholic old guard. The only reason that the pro-life movement in Ireland is so strong is because [American money is being pumped into organisations like Youth Defence](http://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/01/why-american-pro-life-dollars-are-pouring-into-ireland/266981/) by people who want to remotely enforce their own religious ideologies. Again, as I mentioned, this is being lapped up by the Catholic old guard, but is broadly against the wishes of the majority of the population.

My guess is that your opinion on women's rights in Ireland has been maligned because of the recent coverage of the death of Savita Halappanavar - that case is not truly representative of the attitudes of Irish people. There was widespread outrage at her death, and rightly so.

The younger generations of Irish people (myself included) are broadly very liberal and [are abandoning organised religion \(and the associated dogmas\) at a rate that outstrips almost every other country in the world](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/republic-of-ireland-abandoning-religion-faster-than-almost-every-other-country-in-the-world-8022439.html).

As for homosexual rights, bear in mind that [England only legalised gay marriage in March 2014](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_the_United_Kingdom). Ireland will have a referendum on legalising gay marriage in 2015, and [support for the legalisation of gay marriage and adoption is very strong](http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/0220/505702-same-sex-marriage/) in the Republic.

I'd hardly refer to a 1 - 2 year delay in following the UK in terms of legalising gay marriage as constituting a ""third world"" approach to gay rights.

true,LordMondando,null,null,"&gt; Where does money come from? In the modern economy, most money takes the form of bank deposits. But how those bank deposits are created is often misunderstood.

Ok, when I read that I was like 'lolwtf' because, why is the BoE the body that does this for the country saying that. 

First off, that quote exactly does not appear in the document. Allow me to quote this verbatim though.

p1
&gt;Although commercial banks create money through lending,
they cannot do so freely without limit. Banks are limited in
how much they can lend if they are to remain profitable in a
competitive banking system. Prudential regulation also acts
as a constraint on banks’ activities in order to maintain the
resilience of the financial system. And the households and
companies who receive the money created by new lending
may take actions that affect the stock of money — they
could quickly ‘destroy’ money by using it to repay their
existing debt, for instance.
Monetary policy acts as the ultimate limit on money
creation. The Bank of England aims to make sure the
amount of money creation in the economy is consistent with
low and stable inflation. 


p8

&gt;Unlike currency, which is created by the Bank of England,
bank deposits are mostly created by commercial banks
themselves.  


Your website is lying to you, that quote does not appear in that document. It also makes fuck all sense to appear in that document, as it is incorrect. 

Edit: had more of a read through. It's badly misrepresenting the article which is an explanation of quantitative easing (in essence, the banks 'create money' by borrowing it off the central bank - not changing their status as the lending of last resort, the creator of currency or the arbiter of monitary policy), which is talking about how banks and their deposits interact with the BoE which leads to the creation of money. It's not changing the fact that currency is created by issuing bonds. 

As an aside, its hard to believe someone with a half descent grasp of CSS would not understand that searching text is fairly easy and these days pretty robust and so its mis-attributed quote is easily falsifiable. That website has an agenda to push, its not scientific economics. 

Edit 2: more actual quotes putting it in context better.

Edit 3: As an addendum, if your look at this page you really see whats going on.

http://www.positivemoney.org/how-money-works/proof-that-banks-create-money/

The original false quote, is used as a foundational premise, to then misrepresent actual quotes in a document limited again to QE not general money creation. this is used as their general justification for their organisation.

You should say Northern Ireland, and not include the Republic of Ireland.

They were at it in the 60s, ejecting Catholics from their homes, depriving Irish people of the right to vote, and barring their access to housing by maintaining Unionist-dominated councils in gerrymandered Nationalist areas. The reaction of the Northern Irish establishment to the civil rights campaign in Northern Ireland, as well as sectarian attacks on the Nationalist population, is what sparked the Troubles. This kind of behaviour nothing is new for the British population of Northern Ireland and cannot be painted as an ""Irish"" problem.

&gt;Mr McDougall’s statement that he knew what the UK Government would be announcing days before George Osborne told the media on his Edinburgh visit appears to contradict statements from the Chancellor himself.

&gt;The Chancellor said he based his decision to block a currency union on advice from Sir Nicholas MacPherson. Mr Osborne also said he was only made aware of the UK Treasury advice 24 hours before he announced a currency union would not be on the table.

Yeah, it USED to be. Now most of the middle east is a violent shithole. What ever would possess a British guy to leave his home and go there is beyond me.

&gt;Kind of like blaming the IRA on Christianity. It's about more than religion - there's politics, identity, teenagers/young intelligensia feeling alienated from society (there's a new one) and one of the most bloody and bitter civil wars we've seen in decades.

Sure, but this clearly is a problem with Islam. Maybe age, intelligence, politics is mixed in, but deciding to go abroad, recruit terrorists and destroy the UK in the name of allah certainly is Islam-related.

I'm not sure how the civil war is related. This kid is British. He was born here.

I'm an ex-Muslim who has been trying hard to get this across to people. The problem is religion. It's not due to poverty or bad upbringings. This guy probably had a good upbringing. 

Islam, in no uncertain terms, is the root of Islamic terrorism. The UK needs to face this uncomfortable truth and stop calling people racists when they say so.

Unfortunately, the problem of Sunni fascism is here to stay. We are going to be dealing with it for at least the next 10 years, and we need to beating around the bush.

The threat is NOT  due to multiculturalism, nor immigration, nor even religion in general, it is one, specific group of people - Sunni Muslims, who are causing serious problems for this country.  From the Birmingham school plots, to the July 2005 to Wootton Bassett, to Lee Rigby, Sunni Muslims are where it begins and ends.

All i can provide is anecdotal evidence but when i went on holiday from Manchester to Belfast and Glasgow just travelling, the amount of times i heard people indulge in casual racism was mind blowing. The amount of times i heard people mutter and say N-----,  golliwogs even heard 'zulu' used which i was not aware of. It got even worse at night, I remember walking up the high street one night in Belfast after going out with my family for dinner; there was a group of people who seemed to be from the Caribbean/west indies just walking by and this group of pillocks who seemed to stumble out of a nearby pub started yelling  ""f--- off n---- to where you came from"" and some other colorful racial slurs. I was appalled. My experiences in Glasgow seemed to be as equally/marginally less worse. I can say confidently that Racism is worse in Ireland and Scotland than England.


I'm not trying to sensationalise anything, and i haven't got any statistics or facts all i have is anecdotal evidence and i know Racism is going to be an issue anywhere you go unfortunately but from what i've seen from my experiences it seems to be quite a big issue, if not an elephant in the room, in Ireland and Scotland.

The lesson is diversify, innovate, re-orient yourself, and if all else fails, move. A city isn't a person - its sad when they die but if they die we should let them rather than trying to prop up something that hasn't got a future. Detroit can live, but as a different, and probably smaller, city. 

Similar point in Britain - London, Manchester, Leeds etc. all have a bright future because of economic change. Some smaller cities don't have the critical mass to get economic the advantages that larger urban areas do. They should be allowed to shrink and some of their land returned to nature; frankly a lot of former mill towns are set in much prettier landscapes than much of the rather boring southeast, I think it would actually be a *net gain* to lose some of Berkshire and get some more of South Wales back.

It seems mad to me that we are currently building fewer houses in the south east than many parts of the north.

I remember Evan Davis did a documentary recently about cities which illustrated the folly of trying to ""decide"" where development should happen. There was one vignette where a factory/research centre (I want to say ICI?) was relocated in a different part of the West Midlands against the real wishes of managers because of government policy. In the end the factory ended up closing.

Places like Slough and Croydon are basically the creation of misguided government policy against over-mighty cities - I really can't see what the point was to be honest.

Liverpool didn't play ANY kind of wingers last year; they alternated between attacking Wing-Backs with a 3 man back line, and a midfield Diamond with Raheem Sterling in a free role at the top.

The only team you mentioned who seem to have attempted or even had the opportunity to play inverted wingers was Manchester United, and I don't think you can consider their season ""successful"" in any way, shape, or form.

I'm sorry, but I just don't see the evidence for this inverted winger revolution. It's true that more teams (and Chelsea do this) are playing with 3 attacking midfielders, none of whom are wingers, but they do play at least one player with his stronger foot wide, and those systems often allow their attacking 3 to interchange often, meaning they're not playing wingers at all.

Look at city the same year with Aguero, Dzeko and Tevez scoring 17, 15 and 17 respectively with only Toure getting into double figures for the midfielders. 

The season before that, Aguero, Dzeko and Balotelli got 30, 19 and 17 goals respectively whilst their highest midfielder - Toure only got  9 goals.

That same year, Rooney managed 34 goals, Hernandez netting 12, whilst only 2 midfielders (Welbeck - who was occasionally played at striker and Nani) made it to 12 and 10 goals.

The year Before that, United strikers Rooney, Berbatov and Hernandez scored 16, 21, 20 goals respectively whilst only Nani made it into double figures from the midfield (10). 

Interestingly that year, Chelsea's midfielders managed to score a lot of goals, with Malouda and Lampard scoring 14 and 13 goals respectively, whilst strikers Anelka and Drogba could only manage 16 and 13 each. we still finished 2nd that year.

The year before that we do get an outlier with Lampard scoring 27 goals and drogba netting over 30 himself.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Yeah, it USED to be. Now most of the middle east is a violent shithole. What ever would possess a British guy to leave his home and go there is beyond me.

Is it so hard to see how millions suffering is a powerful motive to take up a cause and fight?

A genuine desire to change the world for the better and to help people fighting for a cause you believe in - it is precisely these laudable motives that are warped into some of the most vicious and dogmatic ideologies and practices in history.

&gt;Sure, but this clearly is a problem with Islam. Maybe age, intelligence, politics is mixed in, but deciding to go abroad, recruit terrorists and destroy the UK in the name of allah certainly is Islam-related.

That's the ideology, but like I say there are recent variants of it associated with Christianity or communism. It's not unique to Islam - a true atheist or humanist analysis tries to look for the human drives *behind* the codified ideological justifications.

That's not say there is nothing about Islam to be criticised, but that Islam is not *unique* in being an ideology capable for sending young men to fight against their own society and in foreign wars. That's a far more fundamental human trait.

You have to explain *why* people want to do this - and sorry but religion isn't it. Not on it's own. There are millions of Muslims in the world to whom the idea of fighting for ISIS more scary than it is for us - and many Muslims in Iraq have more reason to fear them than we do.

&gt;Sure, but this clearly is a problem with Islam. Maybe age, intelligence, politics is mixed in, but deciding to go abroad, recruit terrorists and destroy the UK in the name of allah certainly is Islam-related.

&gt;I'm not sure how the civil war is related. This kid is British. He was born here.

He hasn't lived the experience, but look how Vietnam for example charged politics and ideology in Western countries, particularly among young educated people. 

&gt;Again, he's British so I'm not sure how any of that applies.

Because he feels some fellow feeling with others. Che Guevara was not Cuban; people fought in the Spanish Civil War based on international communist solidarity from all over the world.

With this setup, once that aformentioned USB stick full of NI and license numbers goes missing, a person can anonymously request all that data. The DVLA don't need any signed paperwork, and they don't need you to prove who you are.

For example, if that USB stick went missing in the past, you'd have to forge the license holder's signature and then ask the DVLA to send, to a UK address, the records you've requested. I'm not a 100% sure, but they also ask the license holder if they expect this to happen (sort of like a scammer asking for a new VC5).

true,OldManDubya,eng-hertfordshire,Hertfordshire,"But this is slightly different - I think there should be international standards for this sort of thing, just like there should be proper international regulation of carbon. 

London and Hartlepool both have the same labour regulations, no-one is undercutting anyone here. But an international bank or technology firm is unlikely to base itself in Hartlepool because it doesn't have what it needs. Many northern industrial cities developer where they did purely because they were located close to needed raw materials - water power, coal and iron. In the 19th Century I'm sure there were people in formerly prosperous parts of the south (Essex, and Suffolk, the Cotswolds, Cornwall) who thought the economy was becoming dangerously imbalanced towards the north and that something should be done. Times change.

I think you're misusing the term comparative advantage - wikipedia defines it rather nicely as ""the ability of a party to produce a particular good or service at a lower marginal and opportunity cost over another"". Sticking to its comparative advantage is exactly what the west *has* done, its just that those comparative advantages change over time.

It would be silly for British people in general to waste their time making cloth and plastic toys because the concentrations of capital and knowledge that we have mean we can make money doing other things (i.e using up a British worker has a higher opportunity cost than using up a Chinese worker). Relating to the previous discussion, those concentrations of knowledge, skills and capital are at their greatest in Britain's cities. 

The Chinese however have (or increasingly had) large amounts of cheap labour, so they can produce, say, toys, at a lower cost, and at a lower opportunity cost. However, the massive pool of Chinese labour is not limitless, wages are rising fast and some low cost manufacturing is moving away from China. China has to make the jump up the value chain as South Korea and Taiwan did - this is hard, and not all countries make it, getting caught in the ""middle income trap"". Eventually, as the pool of poor labourers dries up, we should get to a situation where such jobs are done by machines everywhere.

As to what you say about those multinationals - well what they owe these countries is not to cheat, essentially. They shouldn't manipulate their balance sheets to disguise the nature of transactions and hide money offshore; if they want to benefit from our legal and regulatory regimes they should pay for it. The environment which allowed these companies to grow was one that was stable and did not overly burden them; we should preserve that environment.

But they do not owe us jobs - and at any rate, they usually still provide thousands of well-paying jobs administering the company (legal departments, accountants etc.) selling, (marketing, sales) and designing their products. Also they are not just employers, but producers - by reducing costs they allow us to have a better standard of living. I don't really understand what you want them to do - employ people at a loss in a factory in England? 

It is up to people to make these choices; if it is so important that companies keep manufacturing jobs in Britain then people should buy more expensive British made products. I frankly don't see what the point would be; the most successful manufacturing economies have few, skilled, and well paid workers as in Germany. The most successful British manufacturers are companies like Rolls Royce and GlaxoSmithKline. I guarantee you that 90% of people would even rather the horrors of working as a telemarketer than standing at an assembly line inserting rod A into socket B over and over.

Saying that they owe it to their communities to keep people on at a loss is like saying that companies which made tractors and steam-powered wheat threshers should have paid people to stay on in the fields. People in the 18th Century would be flabbergasted that 99% of us don't work on growing and harvesting crops anymore - even if we can feed ourselves, *what would people do*? 

But we found stuff for them to do, didn't we?

true,Chrisischan,flair8,,"Salah is left-footed, and Schurrle primarily used his left foot when playing from the right, much like Mirallas did with Everton. Deulofeu conversely, while preferring to cut in and attack instead of cross, did so on his right. 

I'll give you Liverpool for the sake of the formations you correctly cite, but Sturridge's heat maps are those of an inverted wide forward picking up the ball to the right to attack, while Sterling's and especially Coutinho's are very much those of inverted wingers picking up the ball from the left and moving centrally.

Man U had been using bilateral inverted wingers quite often for several years under Ferguson, last year's failures can hardly be indicative of failure of an inverted winger system.

In my opinion, Rooney has to go unless he starts being much more disciplined and helping out in defence. Gerrard is probably past it now too, unfortunately, there's no point keeping him around as anything other than a mentor. Time to go for youth. They need to bring through players like Luke Shaw etc, build a core of young players.

England need to be more tactically astute, that's the thing this world cup has highlighted more than anything else. You can't go with one set tactic that you're going to do every game, running to the line and crossing it mindlessly like a David Moyes team into forwards that prefer to have it played to feet. 

I'd have the following as the team for the last game and probably keep something similiar going forward. I put Flanno in as an option since i don't know the rules regarding call ups, but surely Oxlade Chamberlains world cup is over? perhaps he can play?

true,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"If you have unlimited access to cheap loans, like the Americans provided after the Second World War, stimulus is great. If you have a massive pile of money that you accumulated during the good times, stimulus is great! If you are running taxes for the rich and wealthy well below the international averages and in a manner which enables them to be taxed in an efficient manner without harming the economy, tax rises are great! 

We don't have that. Labour didn't run up the surpluses during the good times, instead assuming they had abolished boom and bust they had growth deficits which they used to build schools, hospitals and the like. The cost of doing that was that they couldn't do that during an economic crisis in the form of 'stimulus'. Anything we had left over was spent bailing out the banks. So, we had no reserves of funds, international markets quite worried about lending anymore money to us if we didn't have a coherent idea of how we were going to pay it back, and taxes on the banks and the rich were increased, but this made barely a dent in the growing deficit.

Knowing they weren't going to get re-elected, Brown then promises a whole bunch of stuff to everyone while simultaneously pledging greater austerity than Margaret Thatcher ever achieved.

The problem with Keynesianism is not the spending money part. Pretty much everyone agrees that is generally a good thing to do during recessions. The disagreement is on the whole, running massive surpluses rather than using that money for political gain, part.

The day that the anti-austerity crowd advocate ideological retrenchment of the state and reduced assistance to help the poor and needy during economic boom times to prevent austerity during the bad times is when I will give a shit about their rallies. When they rally during economic growth demanding reduced spending and higher taxes purely to run surpluses, then I will see them as legitimate.

Two reasons due to the nature of the system: 1) The CB's are more exposed in Bielsa/Poch systems because the wingbacks press significantly higher and the two CB's are spread rather wide, with the space in between them covered by the two CM's. 2) The system prompts the opposition to counter so as to catch the numbers high in the press. The faster the opposition counters/transitions, the less numbers will be able to get back and help the CB's on the high back line. This places particular strain on the CB's, the two targeted players responsible with dealing with a counter in behind, and they will need to communicate with the players ahead of them to eliminate the atypical frequency of counter in such a system. 

Therefore, in order to best counter these weaknesses, a source of frequent and demanding communication from the positions with the best line of sight, that are also coincidentally the most strained positions, is very beneficial to the successful functioning of such a system.

You can become a governer with no background in education - with no qualifications at all, actually - and then be in charge of the major decisions made in a school. In this plot the governers have done stuff like hire specific people into leadership roles, fire non-Muslim (and ""the wrong type"" of Muslim) staff, try to change the curriculum to remove sex education and evolution, etc.

In theory, if the governers cared about the education of children, they could be a governer in multiple schools so that they use good ideas from one school in another, employ staff from one school in another (if someone is ready to be promoted but there isn't a job available in their current school), get one head to work with another that's having problems, and so on.

Working with multiple schools would also give the governer some perspective so they could compare the schools and see what is causing the success/failure of each school.

I know of councillers, MPs, ex-Ofsted inspectors and ex-headteachers that become governers because they want to improve the schools they work with.

PFI schemes are not inherently bad. They can sometimes be good. Furthermore, investing in education, healthcare and the like are not inherently bad things.

My point is that there is an opportunity cost to doing so, which takes the form of not being able to do so at other times.

Consequently, Labour got to gain a load of political capital and economic benefit during the good times which they would not have gotten if they had not done so. And this forced the Conservatives to promise to do the same, as otherwise they would have been hammered for wanting to make ideological cuts.

What I am trying to get across is that the cost for doing that stuff then is that we cannot do it now, so in the same way political ideologies and figures shouldnt be allowed to get away with doing both, spending during the good times and advocating spending during the bad.

I have no problem with Keynes. I merely think that anyone advocating the positive aspect of Keynes during the bad times is obliged to advocate the negative side during the good. If they don't, then they are ideologically bankrupt hypocrites.

true,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"We are not divinely ordained to have massive amounts of free money whenever we want it. If we want to borrow, we have to borrow from people who want to get their money back and charge based on how risky things are. If they consider us to be a risk, this means they charge us more. This can mean that that by borrowing more to avoid austerity we need to cut more just to pay back our increased loans.

We were able to spend loads of money after the war because the americans gave us the economic version of a cheat code. Basically, to stop us turning communist as well as helping to prop up western europe, they gave us access to massive amounts of loanable funds on cheap rates which were intended as long term strategic investments. 

As such, things like 'can Britain pay these loans off?', 'Is the debt to GDP ratio too high?' and 'Do they actually have a logical long term strategic economic strategy, or are they just dependent on debt?' didn't matter to them.

We don't have an exceptionally rich sugar daddy's debt backing anymore. We have to pay attention to things like markets, and confidence, and people asking the legitimate question 'why should I loan you money at a cheap rate when I'm not sure that I'll get it back?'. These are important questions when your state is trying to borrow money to stimulate the economy and run deficits.

true,Kahlvin,null,null,"**Full Description of Reddit's change and why below**

Reddit uses a system they call ""vote fuzzing"" in conjunction with shadow banning in order to deal with vote bots. 

""Vote bots"" are accounts that people make in order to vote up or down certain content automatically.  They are run automatically and are frowned upon.  Reddit has an algorithm to identify them.  When one is identified, it is Shadow banned.

""Shadow banning"" means that an account becomes essentially invisible to the outside world; their votes do not count toward the totals and nobody can see their comments.  The comment part doesn't matter for vote-bots, because they don't comment, but they can detect if their vote isn't counted if the overall score doesn't move.

""Vote fuzzing"" is a process that Reddit uses to combat this.  Reddit will automatically add upvotes and downvotes (in equal amounts) at random intervals, the frequency of which is determined by the overall popularity of the post.  This makes it more difficult for bots to determine whether their votes counted, and therefore if they have been shadow banned.  Ever wonder why 150 people downvoted that guy that is providing everybody with gifs of all of the exciting plays in a game thread?  They aren't, those 150 downvotes are the result of vote fuzzing.

**As a result** of vote fuzzing, it was impossible to determine how much people actually liked a post.  Every post that made it to the top of /r/all had an approval rating of about 55%, when in reality they had an approval rating of 90-95%.  The +/- numbers on all large posts told us less than nothing, as the majority of the votes were fuzzed.

This change allows you to see what percentage of people actually like a post.  This thread, for example, has an 82% approval rating as of the time I post this (visible at the top right of the comments section).  It also allows a much better ""controversial"" sorting (if you use that), because all highly voted comments don't come out to 55% approval.

The only downside (other than people complaining because they didn't understand the system and thought that the post with 3000 karma actually had 15000 people upvoting and 12000 people downvoting) is that comments and posts with a small number of overall votes (&lt;50) do not show their vote counts, which had been accurate since vote fuzzing doesn't take place until 50-100 total votes have been cast.  You can't tell if that terrible pun with 3 karma has 4 up and 1 down, or 36 up and 33 down.

On the plus side, you hopefully won't have to hear ""I don't understand why people are downvoting you..."" anymore. ",0,1403378759,null,0,false,0,cidhl2f,t3_28pubc,t1_cidhl2f,t1_cidgape,null,1434341423,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6
true,tomllm,wales-Glamorgan,Glamorganshire,"Investing in areas of market failure is almost always a good thing, but it seems to have been done with reckless abandon by the old Labour government - completely disregarding sustainability.  It's certainly true that some hospitals needed to be built, but building them all at once was imo a mistake.  Better to have spread out the building so as not to take on so much debt.  But the hospitals have been built - there's no need for the Tories to continue with big building works.  The problem is that this accumulated debt is now cutting into patient care.  

It's not as though our aging population has come as a sudden surprise yet services like district nursing, which often catch problems before they become acute and cost far more, are being cut to cope with the financial pressure. 

I live in Wales and there are different if equally serious problems here.  As it's a small geographic area, there's been a push for centralising really specialist stuff like neurosurgery into single, national units.  Not only would it save money but it would make everything more efficient and improve patient care as they would be being treated by experts in their area.  Despite the fact it would be far better and safer to have your gallbladder taken out by an expert abdominal laparoscopic surgeon in the Princess of Wales hospital than have a general surgeon perform open surgery to remove it in YGC, even the slightest suggestion of closing a nearby service and moving it further away is always met by vehement opposition.  The NHS could be so much more efficient here.  The Velindre Cancer Health Board is a good example.

This will be highly unscientific, but there is a number of around 35% who unquestioningly want to leave and 35% who unquestioningly want to stay. This leaves 30% who are in the don't know pile.

Their opinons change based on circumstances. Can we renegotiate the deal? Can we repatriate powers? Is the EU just going to endlessly head towards ever closer union with no way of stopping it? Will we end up with a free trade agreement if we leave? Is the NHS under threat from the trade deal with the US? Is there going to be a financial transactions tax? Is Europe currently putting up the facade of listening to our concerns, or telling us how things are going to be?

Based on the percieved answers to the questions above, you can get any result imaginable. Tell people that the EU can never be reformed, will become increasingly centralised, and don't give a shit about humouring us and that we can get a nice trade deal then, for some reason, people want to leave. But if the EU is wonderful, progressive and open to changing in the ways that we want, but a trade deal is impossible, then those exact same people want to stay.

Globalisation is a thing. Wages are not based on fairness, what people think they are entitled to, and are not whiggishly destined to forever improve. They are based on the relative negotiating strength of individuals and institutions compared to industries.

Since the 1970's it has become evermore easier to outsource jobs in production and resource extraction to the developing world. This means that workers need to be cost effective enough compared to the international market for it to be valid keeping their jobs here. This naturally means that wages are going to be massively undercut and stagnant for the economic benefit of the wealthiest.

Further, this negotiation position also weakens governments, who are further disempowered with regards to negotiating with companies to remain in the country. Taxes also depend on how easy it is for companies to move offshore, which has similarly been weakened by globalisation.

2) Another quote is that the Time Lords were the ""oldest and mightest race"" as well as the ""We came first"".

( I personally don't use mephedrone but know plenty of people that do)

Whilst a lot of people still bought 4-MMC from their regular dealers the criminal black market did not have a monopoly on both the price and quality of the drug since it was available on the internet.  

Now whilst the long term effects are still not known , very few people died due to mephedrone alone despite the fact that people were routinely hoovering up several grams of it in a night.

It would be interesting to compare the figures for the amount of people that have died due to ecstasy or cocaine to mephedrone, as it would suggest that purer substances can reduce fatalities short term. 

Admittedly more people use coke and e in the UK but during the time that mephedrone got really big (09-11) there was very little good MD or blow in the country, so it is not too much of a stretch to suggest that a large portion of coke/e users moved on to mephedrone during that time.

But 'The Second Machine Age' was similarly dismal looking instead at technology rather than globalisation (even FoxConn is automating now..) it just seems that all of these things are massively benefiting those who own capital versus those who don't.

Also the explosion in financial services means those who own capital are doing even less than ever before - it used to be argued that it was right for capitalists to get a return as they knew how to invest wisely etc. but increasingly the investment decisions are not even made by them - instead they get more wealth simply because they currently have wealth.

We have also seen an increase in rent-seeking behaviour (the richest Briton is a landowning aristocrat after all) and the expansion of such behaviour to intellectual property (which has some legitimate uses to be fair). This means that increasingly people are not making fortunes by contributing to the economy but by leading a sort of parasitic existence which harms true innovation and contribution. Ricardo and Smith warned of these sorts of behaviours centuries ago and yet we still don't listen.

You should clarify by writing ""Northern Ireland"" instead of ""Ireland"" - all of the racism you described occurred within the UK. And, as an Irish person who was born in London, I can tell you for a fact that the majority of the racism, xenophobia and backward thinking in Ireland (i) occurs in Northern Ireland, and (ii) comes from the loyalist community.

The Republic of Ireland is not a racist country. It's a bit rich for you to talk like England is some kind of enlightened utopia compared to Scotland or Ireland. The last time I checked, the majority of the Tory vote comes from England. I refer to this in the context of the government-sponsored mobile ads telling illegal immigrants to ""go back where they came from"". The attitudes of the Tories haven't changed much over the decades: http://i.imgur.com/jw6Kx8G.jpg

Furthermore, organisations like the BNP, UKIP have the majority of their following in England. Not in Scotland, and not in Northern Ireland.

The Republic of Ireland has no such right-wing parties, and no right-wing organisations like the EDL. Now, I'm not trying to pretend it's a perfect place. There are narrow-minded xenophobes in all societies, however, I will say that having lived in Ireland for 21 years I could count on one hand the number of incidents of racial slurs being used against immigrants in public that I've personally seen.

The riots of 2011, as well as the ongoing ""trojan horse"" case in Birmingham, show that racial and ethnic tensions are far higher in England than in the Republic of Ireland. To suggest otherwise is plainly wrong.

Healthcare should be universal and it is too important to put profit before standards of service.  Every penny put into the NHS is spent on a service, private healthcare is primarily there to service the shareholders and the only incentive for a good service is the loss of business a poor service would result in.  The emphasis and priority in the NHS is in the right place and because of that, the attitude of the staff is in the right place:  provision of a good service because it's the *right thing to do*, not becuase it's the profitable thing to do.

We currently have the option for private treatment through things like BUPA and (if you have the money and the inclination) you have the option to go down that route.  If the NHS was utterly shite I would agree that we needed more options and that pressure might encourage the NHS to improve.  But it's not.  It's not perfect but it's better than any other system I've seen for the price and price is an issue for any government department.

I grew up outside the UK where it was common for those with the money to have private medical insurance and at the time I naively thought that this was perfectly acceptable, as thousands suffered and died using the under-staffed and under-resourced government medical system.  I still felt this way when I moved here and for years afterwards, lamenting the waste and inefficiency in the NHS and how long it took for me to see physios and be treated in A &amp; E.  And then I had kids and that's when you realise that when the chips are down the system works and they don't mess around.  I could spend some of my disposable income on private healthcare but it would significantly effect my life for no real benefit because the NHS is good enough.

The risk we face by trying to partially privatise or in any other way mess with the NHS far outweighs the benefits we will gain from such a move.      ",0,1403381412,null,0,false,0,cidim03,t3_28jom3,t1_cidim03,t1_cid9234,null,1434341906,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I just gave you some non anecdotal evidence there. Ireland has a problem with racism, but arguably less than England. We don't have people voting for racists and electing  them to office. 

You're painting an entire country as racist based on one or two experiences, while ignoring any evidence that shows that you are wrong. You seem to be prejudiced against the Irish. Don't worry, we think you are an awful cunt too.

Minimum pricing would link the tax specifically to the number of units, whereas the current tax is only approximately linked. It would also prevent anyone selling it for less as a loss leader (absorbing the cost themselves) but I doubt this is done to any significant extent.

Mainly, it would take it out of the budget, so they could quietly increase it whenever they wanted to.

The downside is that there would probably be an increase in knock-off booze. Probably mainly spirits (if you are going to smuggle, it might as well be something high value).

I don't want to praise her, as her handling of certain issues was far from politically reasonable and often just generally bad.

As for her reelection, it was partly a coincidence. Elections came at times of peak popularity for her, but there were severe dips in between. An example was the Falklands war. Not brilliantly timed, but she was still popular for her winning of it by the time elections rolled around.

Her lack of popularity today is, I think, due to one main thing and that is that she has become a go-to example of a bad politician even for people who know nothing about her or her policies. It is somewhat like Justin Bieber and comic sans, both of which are generally considered to be far from brilliant but just get more hate than they would if people were thinking about it entirely or not being influenced by society.

Except they're the same thing.

Trade agreements involve legal supremacy to the same extent that the EU does.* There are two big differences; one is that the details of the EU rules can be changed without needing a renegotiation (although that may be creeping into some trade agreements, see CETA), and the second being that we have some democratic input into the EU.

Polls aren't worthless, and they usually have more than one question. Pollsters have spent many years and a lot of money trying to get polls to work and to be reliable (so they can sell them); they know what they are doing. The mistake is to just read the headline figure.

This poll may have asked the question giving three options (In, renegotiate, out), and when presented that option, some polls may give an overall ""renegotiate or out"" majority. But others, like the 44% one, might just have the two options, in which case a majority go with ""in."" Both polls are valid, and both give some insight into the public (when taken in context). The polls may have other questions asking for details about why people chose the way they did, but that tends to be more expensive, so doesn't happen in the weekly polls.

From the article

&gt; [If Cameron secures a negotiation], 42% say they would either definitely or probably vote to stay in, against 36% who would probably or definitely vote to leave.

So that's closer to last week's YouGov poll.

true,KopiteKing13,lfcflame,,"Half right, half not. And it depends on the players in question.

English players will always be worth more to English clubs than they will to foreign clubs due to the home-grown rules in the Premier League, so an English player who is worth £30m to an English club will be worth considerably less to a foreign club.

Likewise, £30m spent by an English club will get you a better foreign player than spending £30m would get for an English player (again, due to the home-grown rule and the premium on English players).

That being said though, the transfer fee is only half of the equation. There are also wages. Wages aren't determined by nationality or any other factors other than how good that player is. Someone at Barcelona or Real Madrid might be earning £150-200k/week because those clubs can afford it. Liverpool wouldn't be able to afford to pay those wages, so the player would have to agree to a massive pay cut to come here.

So even though we could go for either Lallana or Sanchez, both at £25-30m, Sanchez's wages probably are **far** greater than Lallana's, so it will be cheaper for us in the long run to go for Lallana. All of these numbers I'm making are just guesses for the point of illustration, though.

But to answer your question, no, just because a player is foreign doesn't mean his wages are higher. Wages are completely unrelated and just are determined by how good he is and what his current club is paying him as opposed to how much he's willing to accept elsewhere. There are plenty of foreigners who come to England with low wages if they agree to it anyway.

My advice? Find a gym (if you can afford it) if not, go running. Every morning, rain, sun, snow, wind, whatever. Go running, every morning at 7:00 am. Make it a habit. Once you're done, eat, shower and go hunt for jobs. Go apply for night college. Do something with that. If you get up at 7:00 am you'd be surprised how much you can do in day.

As far as your attitude towards others, you need to see a therapist.

So you need to figure out how to adjust your outlook, and get some motivation before any change will really be possible. If you're convinced it's where you are, then leave.

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"The key to Thatcher was that she was polarising and if you ask anyone who was alive during her tenure, you will get an opinion - no ambivalence, just a hard and fast opinion that's either very pro or very anti.

Some of this is about ideology: Thatcher had very different ideas to how Britain should be run that went entirely against what we call the *post war consensus* (i.e. a robust welfare state, strong union participation in politics, nationalisation of key industries and the like) and people can argue the toss about the merits of that until the cows come home. However, what sets Thatcher apart is the zeal with which she set about implementing her vision and the fact that she was always more than willing to break a few societal eggs to make her free-market omelet. 

This is what inflames people - either pro or anti - about Thatcher. To the pros, she was the person who took a moribund Britain that was struggling to come to terms with it's position in the world, kicked it up the arse and gave it a new sense of purpose. There's some credence to this because Britain in the late 70's wasn't exactly the poster boy for successful social democracy: We had rolling strikes, the three day week and the Winter of Discontent - not to mention the tangible sense of irreversible decline. Seen in this light, Thatcher was one with the stones to stand up to vested interests and gave Britain a new sense of purpose.

However, this came at a price because and while Thatcher was very concerned with ends, she wasn't too bothered about means and would happily sacrifice any number of sacred cows if she thought it furthered her vision of the world. That meant that an awful lot of people lost out during her time and those people tended to be at the lower end of the economic scale and also disproportionately in the North. That's not to say that change wasn't needed - it was - but the fact that she seemed to relish trampling over things that people held dear made it  very personal for a great many people (I have a feeling Tony Blair will also be viewed in a similar light).

Agreed. Even the most intelligent people in the world can't be immune from propaganda. Propaganda is so powerful people don't even realize. It can make anyone believe anything, nobody is immune. You like to think you're ""too clever"" to fall for mind warping propaganda but nobody is, and there is probably a whole bunch of propaganda stuffed in my brain right now that I don't realize is propaganda, it's so dangerous. 

I'm actually very interested in propaganda as a medium and have studied it quite a bit, and I'm convinced a smart propagandist could make you believe absolutely anything or hate absolutely anyone, and all the while you'd think it was your own initiative and wit and you were never deceived or played along at all. Scary stuff! and what's even more interesting is that studies have shown that people who think they are ""awake"" to propaganda tricks are actually even more susceptible to fall for propaganda than people who aren't. 

So technically even though I am well studied in propaganda and it's tricks, I'm even more likely to fall for it than the average joe, because I think I've got it all figured out and get cocky. Yikes! 

What's even more worrying is everything is propaganda, from newspapers to documentaries to hollywood films to speeches by public figures and even posts on reddit, you're constantly being bombarded with it and it's probably impossible to not soak it up at least a little bit.

Anyway, if the job is in finance your outfit could obviously be slightly different than if the job is in a creative industry but a solid shirt and tie combo with a dark blue suit or grey suit should do you fine. Don't try to inject too much personality but you don't have to wear a black suit, white shirt, and a red tie.

Another good tip is to take a satchel or a briefcase, even if you only keep a copy of your CV/portfolio in there it always looks professional  - like you already belong.

Interviews are great fun really. This company is hiring you because they think you can help them make more money. Can you? Damn right you can, so go in and tell them (but don't act like you're on The Apprentice for god's sake). Remember it's a two way interview, you're interviewing them too (but you're not the interviewer so don't get too carried away). Try to establish why the position is available? Can you move around within the company? Did the other employees come from the same background as you? 

If you have a nice relaxed chat with your interviewer the dreaded ""Any more questions?"" section will simply flow into the natural conversation and you won't even notice the interview drawing to an end.

Anyhow, that turned into more than I expected. Just dress and act like you already work there and you'll be fine. If you really need anything before hand just phone reception and ask them, make sure you get their name and thank them face to face when you get to the actual building!

&gt; so I did evening classes to get the GCSE's I required for college - They were a waste of my time, I knew everything they were teaching me, it was just making me feel sick.

One of the hardest lessons a bright young man like yourself *has* to learn is that you have to grind your way through some really boring shit to get the certificates the world wants to see. It's not fun, that's for sure. It's politics.

You're not alone in finding it difficult to finish something you feel is a waste of time. It is a common story amongst those with quick minds.

I'm sorry you've had a rough time in life. I keep raging against the machine - against injustice. Unfortunately the world is a pretty shit place - truth be told. And many people will use violence to get what they want.

Young adult years are tough, too, because we all want to be loved, accepted, validated, approved. That's why so many young men run in gangs. They are scared little kids who need approval and will do *anything* to get it.

What I'm saying is: get prepared to be lonely. Finding good loyal friends that don't try and control you is difficult. Going out at night on public transport is dangerous.

I admire that you want to change your life - and you're willing to examine your life to now to consider what to do next.

Clearly you need to have some goals in mind (like some others have said). I suggest:

* find an office job somewhere, even at a junior level, even in another town
* flatshare if necessary, but focus on the job for a year, get that under your belt
* aim for your income to regularly exceed your outgoings
* aim for a life without violence
* work hard even if you feel you're not being adequately rewarded
* aim for a cheap rental of your own one day (though I was flatsharing even in my 30s)
* consider doing the GCSEs again part-time (yes it is boring, just do it)

EDIT: Another reason you get apparently unrelated groups turning up is because it's a way of showing that the group supports the main cause.

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"Disclosure: I'm a governor at the CofE primary school my kids went to. I joined mainly because I wanted to help the school my kids went to. 

The point of being a governor is that you don't necessarily know much about education. Whether or not you have a background in education (our chair of governors is a former head) you're not supposed to  comment on professional matters of education. 

The chairs of governors in our locality all meet to discuss best practice, and we've spun up a CIC to supply services that the local authority doesn't provide any more. It's not necessary for a governor to be involved in multiple schools - all that's needed is that governors of related schools talk.

The governing body is responsible for appointing the head, but should not get involved in other 
appointments. Other appointments are the responsibility of the school's management team. The governors don't have any say in the detail of these appointments, but would raise the alarm if say the management team tried to appoint someone without qualifications.

The system works really well in our school, but I accept it doesn't work everywhere. The governing body is probably a reflection of the community the governors are drawn from. 

In Academies it's a bit different as parents (read: the governing body) have more power. It may be significant that all the schools involved in the Trojan horse thing are Academies.

Low-income heavy drinkers typically drink large amounts of very cheap alcohol, typically 45% of their alcohol units are sub-45p. Current models show that with a 45p minimum a typical low-income heavy drinker would drink 300 less units a year.

Low-income moderate drinkers generally buy more expensive alcohol anyway only drinking a small number of sub-45p units. With a 45p minimum a typical low-income moderate drinker would drink about 5 less units a year (i.e two pints).

Obviously you can argue that low-income heavy drinkers have a right to be heavy drinkers, but you can equally argue that minimum pricing would save the NHS tens of millions of pounds in alcohol related issues (not to mention 800+ lives a year).

There was plenty of slack until the shit hit the fan in 2008. If they had been running a surplus of 3% instead of a deficit then at that point it would have made little difference.

Borrowing during a crisis is like running away from a tiger: I don't have to be faster than the tiger; I just need to be faster than you. There were a lot of funds seeking safe havens, and as long as we were ahead of Greece, rates were unlikely to rise. 

Ideological retrenchment of the state is ...  ideological. It has merits and disadvantages all of its own, but is largely unconnected to the current crisis. What I do object to is that this government haven't pursued retrenchment on its merits; they have disingenuously carried it out on the back of a controversial response to a financial crisis.

And as far as helping the poor and needy, this is a drop in the budgetary ocean. I bitterly object to this being cut when there are so many other options. But with FPTP it's always possible to dump on people that are unlikely to vote for your party.

It was based on the idea that controlling the money supply, privatising anything governmental and deregulating the markets was the way to strong growth without inflation. 
But it turned out that they could not control the money supply and their sell off of their assets lost them billions in revenue, as always happens. 

She could not believe that her trickle down theory did not work, she had a delusion that the money men were charitable men at heart and could not understand why they held on to the public funds she gave them.

The social aspects of her premiership was increasing crime figures, more homelessness and unemployment and unrest. She blamed this all on the unspecified ""enemies from within"" by which she meant the working classes. She declared war on the working classes and their political representatives and organisations and won that war. 

The working classes before Thatcher were mosly seen as salt of the earth but she started a slow process of demonisation against them that has lasted to this day, just as it has done in the US.  Take a look at the Welsh valleys to see how she treated those who could not fight back.

She went insane in about 1990 and was removed from power by her cabinet.

&gt; Where does money come from?   In the modern economy, most money takes the form of bank deposits. But how those bank deposits are created is often misunderstood. The principal way in which they are created is through commercial banks making loans: whenever a bank makes a loan, it creates a deposit in the borrower’s bank account, thereby creating new money. As ‘Money creation in the modern economy’ explains, though, banks cannot create money in this way without limit: how much banks lend will rest on the profitable lending opportunities available to them which will, crucially, depend on the interest rate set by the Bank of England.  In this way, monetary policy acts as the ultimate limit on money creation. 
This description of how money is created differs from the story found in some economics textbooks....

I don't see a big difference between that and what positive money quoted. Positive Money also deal with the limits to lending arguing interest rates are not effective.

And prudential regulation made me laugh!!

little money to be consistent with the economy meeting the

lowering the policy rate to encourage more lending and hence
more money creation. But, in response to the financial crisis,
the MPC cut Bank Rate to 0.5% — the so-called effective
lower bound.
Once short-term interest rates reach the effective lower
bound, it is not possible for the central bank to provide further
stimulus to the economy by lowering the rate at which

It would get you somewhere abroad doing some good charity work, good for the CV, good for your soul. Traveling is great and maybe you'll get the experience and confidence to get out.

There's a lot to be said for the positive attitude advice you've been given, but you asked for positive steps, not outlooks or motivation.  

The thing I mentioned is free travel and accomodation at a workplace in a 3rd world country for a couple of months. I highly reccomend it, get out of your comfortzone and do something great. Then, you said you're coding? Try look for some work in that, loads of people need coders! if I could retrain I'd learn programming. Where abouts do you live? Ok if you don't wanna say. It may be that you wanna move to another city, it may be that another area of your town would help you, but I'd advise you to try get work so that you can get your own place somewhere so that you don't burn bridges where you are now, that way you have a safety net. 

Try get a simple job, 9-5 in a shop or something,  you can get a shitty room in a house share, meet some new people (at work and in the house) and after work you can work on your programming or whatever. If you have your own place, your own base of operations, you'll be much less tied to people who mistreat you and you can start living for you.

Keep your chin up, let us know how it goes. Good luck bro.

Edit: This advice is meant as a way to first clear your head, then secondly set up a very low shitty start up base (you're a fellow gamer so think tiny base in shitty resource area) then you just grind all day at work to pay bills but on time off you do stuff you like, and stuff to improve. Given time (and I mean a few years, this will take time) you'll be in a nice place of your very own, you'll have more freedom to change jobs and locations. OBVIOUSLY the thinking positive stuff is vital, or you'll go nuts,  but I think having a plan (and it doesn't have to be this one) will help you actually achieve the positive outlook.

&gt;This article has discussed how money is created in the modern
economy. Most of the money in circulation is created, not by
the printing presses of the Bank of England, but by the
commercial banks themselves: banks create money whenever
they lend to someone in the economy or buy an asset from
consumers. And in contrast to descriptions found in some
textbooks, the Bank of England does not directly control the
quantity of either base or broad money. The Bank of England
is nevertheless still able to influence the amount of money in
the economy. It does so in normal times by setting monetary
policy — through the interest rate that it pays on reserves held
by commercial banks with the Bank of England. More
recently, though, with Bank Rate constrained by the effective
lower bound, the Bank of England’s asset purchase programme
has sought to raise the quantity of broad money in circulation.
This in turn affects the prices and quantities of a range of
assets in the economy, including money.",0,1403403166,null,0,false,0,cidqq6y,t3_28oxt5,t1_cidqq6y,t1_cidb8s4,null,1434345968,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

At least one these ""signings"" hasn't even signed yet. If anything some of the attitudes towards Costa, who is still an Atletico player is very annoying. He probably gets more praise here than his own clubs fans! If this becomes another Hulk case where he doesnt sign many people on here will look extremely silly.

&gt; As for Kroos he's probably holding his club hostage for more money.

Not at all. He is getting paid very little at Bayern and wants to be paid as much as he is worth to the team which is a lot. He wants to be paid as much as Lahm, Schweini, Ribery are getting paid which is hardly undeserved. He played more minutes for Bayern last season than any other player besides Neur. And is one of the first names one the German team sheet at the age of 24. Ribery, **Götze**, Lahm, Schweinsteiger, Müller, **Thiago**, Neuer, **Alaba**, Robben, Boateng, **Martinez**, **Rafinha**, **van Buyten** and **Mandzukic** all currently make more than him. Hardly what I would consider holding a club hostage. What Rooney has done to Manchester United is called holding a club hostage.

&gt; Drogba had attitude and was somewhat of a cheat. But it was directed at the opposition. Unpopular opinion maybe but he was our cheat. That's what fucking matters.

I absolutely loved Drogba and you are silly to compare Costa to Drogba. Drogba might have embellished challenges but Costa takes things to an entire new level. Costa would throw spit and mucus from his fucking nose at opposing defenders. That is Hadji Diouf-level disgusting (The guy who would spit into opponent mouths).

You think Drogba's small dives compare to this?

Were you not watching the England match the other night? Cavani and Suarez was the reason for that victory...

I find it striking how many times in the comments, people rush in to basically say that 

&gt; OMG the legal system is afraid of offending these fucking Muslims, how outrageous, offense doesn't matter

Okay, so let's think about this one. If: 

* you respond to stories about people's community centres/sacred spaces being vandalised, by immediately siding with the vandals ... 
* you believe Muslims in this case are getting special treatment that Jews or Christians wouldn't get ... 
* you think that what offends people shouldn't matter under the law ... 

then you're - I won't say 'wrong' - but you're operating at quite a distance from reality and, indeed, from normal human standards. 

The part I really take issue with is the bit where people think 'offense' doesn't matter, isn't something that should ever be taken seriously. 

Because obviously we're all super-rational machine-people here, perhaps without physical bodies at all, just minds floating around the universe on our own farts, with no time for trivial human feelings. 

Therefore if I, oh I don't know, went to a children's section of a graveyard and kicked a load of stones over, that's fine, because really the only victims are the offended relatives and it's only 'offense', right? 

And you'd all definitely, *for sure*, have that same opinion if it was *your* kids' memory I was desecrating? 

Now, now, of course I'm not saying grave desecration and Mosque desecration are exactly equivalent, and I'm not at this point saying that causing offense needs to be punished using the most draconian methods possible. 

But seriously. You're living in a delusional fantasy world if you think the law should only step in after someone actually hits you, and should ignore anything that it's possible label 'offense'. 

A society like this would be impossible to live in and would, anyway, revert to violence almost instantly ... and you're only entertaining the delusion that it *would* work, because in this case the offended persons are Muslims.

true,bri4747,null,null,"Okay, apologies but I have been working with cocktails for the past while so I'm gonna be the annoying guy in the pub nobody pays any attention to.

On which note, anything with three or more ingredients in the UK is considered a cocktail and as such can be free-poured. Anything with 2 ingredients or less needs to be measured according to the weights and measures act that our lovely parliament passed a while back. Three ingredients can be as simple as rum, coke and lime juice (Cuba Libre) or as complex as a Singapore Sling (gin, cherry brandy and about 20 different variations depending on which bar you are in)

The cocktails OP talked about are all pretty strong standard cocktails. They are from the prohibition era (in the colonies, so 1920ish) and before so they aren't too fancy or have any random ingredients in them. I'd probably add a martini (should be made with gin normally) or a vodka martini to that. Mojitios, rickeys and brambles are also pretty simple consisting of alcohol, mixer and fruit mostly and won't be too fattening (unless you chose some random variation of a strawberry/raspberry/gooseberry/rosehip flavoured one)

After that, many people have already said it in the thread but modern cocktails usually have sugar syrup in them, plus the juices that they use aren't exactly weightwatchers. That being said however, they are still relatively low on calories plus they are more alcoholic by volume and so you need to drink less to get drunk quicker. Versus pints or spirit and mixer, they are still ON AVERAGE better for your waistline. 

I love cocktails and will always recommend that you drink them because the vastness of flavours, the different recipes and tastes that you can create, the different nutrients that you can get from both the juices and the fruit garnishes, plus the spectacle of a fresh drink being made specifically for you, right there, right then adds to the overall experience. But the best drink to have to get ""social"" and lose weight would be either gin or vodka with soda water. Very few calories, but tastes like the bitterness of a middle aged woman drinking from her cracked cup in the stairs of her dilapidated house, crying on the night of her 50th birthday because only her cats truly love her and they have all been let outside for the night.

* The problems are caused by your surroundings 
* The way to change those surroundings is through education and work 
* The surroundings, however, are sapping the energy you need to get education and work, making you drop out  

So there's the spiral you're in. 

You need to fight the surroundings using your mind and will-power. 

Despite being in a similar situation, I managed to avoid dropping out of education - somehow, I honestly don't know how, I held on just long enough by a very thin thread. So I feel unqualified to tell you how to deal with dropping out. I imagine when you've dropped out once, a barrier is broken and it's easy to keep doing it.    

I can tell you that once you move to different surroundings, the people who jump you in parks are not a big problem ... not really a feature of life any more.  

Positive steps: 

* Find someone who dropped out but got back together and ask them how they did it
* I second the guy who said you should take up running or join a gym, this is scientifically proven to put good chemicals in your brain which will help you generally 
* Find a charity shop to volunteer in, as due to trauma from being assaulted you may not be ready yet for the stress of a full time job and may need a kind of 'social rehab', i.e. getting used to having duties and interactions, and giving time and energy to other people you like, who need it and pay it back in good vibes, instead of having your time and energy taken from you by arseholes   ",0,1403410453,null,0,false,0,cidtaze,t3_28qxnu,t1_cidtaze,t3_28qxnu,null,1434347249,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Lets say 160,000 people show up to comiccon over 4 days (4 years ago they averaged around 130,000, so not too far of a stretch). That's around 40,000 people every day. Lets assume that only 5% would go to each actor/actress if the photo's were free. That's around 2000 people getting photos with each actor/actress each day. At around 30 seconds/person for posing, picture taking, and hand shaking, that adds up to around 1000 minutes of photography. That adds up to about 16 1/2 hours of picture taking. Put a price tag on that, and you knock that number of people down to around 300-400/day, that allows you to give 1-2 minutes per person for hello's, poses, and thank you's, and it only averages out to about 4-5 hours of photography.

Pros:

- It's pretty cheap.  I'm a student and I pay £65 pw rent for a nice house (much nicer than a lot of student houses) in a nice area.  £3.00 for a beer is expensive.
- Loads of green space.  Check it out on [OSM](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/53.3645/-1.5048).  I live 5 mins. from a reasonably sized park; on my 20min walk into Uni I pass the Botanical Gardens, a tucked-away secret garden type thing, and a slightly smaller park.
- Right next to the peak district.  You can catch a bus (which are also cheap -- £1.40 single within the city, ~£3 single to the peaks) to the countryside and be there in 20 minutes from the city centre.  Or you can walk out there in 45 minutes or so from my house.
- The city centre is pretty ""cultured"".  There's lots of museums and things.  I don't know much about the art scene, but we have 3 large theatres and a few smaller ones dotted about the place.
- Decent music scene.  It's not Manchester or London, but it's not bad.  We've got a pretty thriving folk music scene as well.  There's usually some decent live music on somewhere, e.g. The Greystones pub has put on some pretty good stuff in recent years.

Cons:

- It's a bit overlooked as a city.  Manchester is just over the pennines and Leeds is just round the corner so people skip past it a bit.
- It's very economically divided.  The south and west of the city are distinctly middle class and affluent, and the north and east are very working class industrial areas.
- As a result, if you live in the middle class areas, you don't experience much of the multiculturalism of a lot of northern cities like Manchester, Leeds and Bradford.
- The city centre is a bit small.  Most of the big shops are out in Meadowhall (big shopping centre on the outskirts), so they don't have a branch in town.  Getting to Meadowhall is about £6 return on the tram I think, but I can't remember as I tend to avoid it.
- It's fucking hilly.  I can think of exactly one road that is not on a hill in Sheffield.  This also means no canals :(

Part of it is because we've got CL football and play sexy stuff, but Rodgers' statements have been far more assertive - his latest one was about wanting players of proven quality. Subtext? No more fucking gamble purchases like last summer. No more players that haven't even thrived at the top of a foreign league (Aspas and Alberto), no more Cissokho and Moses low-risk, on-loan-in-case-they-don't-work solutions.

That's why we're going after Lallana and Lovren, players proven in the PL and proven in a system as close to ours as you'll get; Moreno, who accomplished much more for a much better La Liga team than Aspas had done, and is a much better player at a young age than Alberto; this is despite these players, each coming off the best, most high-profile season in their careers and thus being at their most expensive, not fitting FSG's previous ""value-for-money"" ideology. 

Value-for-money delivered brilliantly with Sturridge &amp; Coutinho, but was unable to reliably strengthen us last summer or in January, and Rodgers will have (justifiably) made the point that he could've won the league if the transfer committee had made fewer gambles and brought in more 'sure things'.",0,1403411975,null,0,false,0,cidttqs,t3_28qs6y,t1_cidttqs,t1_cidnrhe,null,1434347494,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

true,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,"&gt; I think you are spot on with this. This is the true difference between the level of Suarez and Costa. Suarez could win the golden boot without half the quality of our midfield, I dont think Costa could do that.

Firstly, Suarez is 2 years older than Costa. Secondly, they're different types of strikers. Third, Suarez was on the same level as Suarez before this 2013/14 season. In fact, at the same age (i.e. 2 seasons ago), Suarez only managed 11 goals in the league and was averaging less than 1 goal per 2 games in the season before that. He was on fire before those 2 seasons, but it was still just the Eredivisie. Fourth, they play in 2 very different systems: Liverpool is heavily striker oriented and rely a lot on their strikers for most of their play. Atletico used Costa as a Target Man/Poacher so he wasn't always in charge of digging his team out of holes.

&gt;If you have no doubt about a striker who had a poor world cup, was riddled with injuries for months (due to him playing instead of letting it heal properly), has only had one world class seasons, and never played in the Premier League than you are not thinking logically.

Lol, I love how you say ""riddled with injuries"". I was 1 injury that was never given enough time to properly heal. Not sure why you haven't been able to grasp that concept yet.

&gt;There have been better strikers with better goal scoring records who have flopped in this league.

I can't think of any strikers that have scored 25+ goals in La Liga that have failed in the EPL. And if you're talking about players like Afonso Alves... anyone that actually watched him would know he was a risky signing.. which is why none of the top clubs wanted him. Costa has played vs the best defences in Europe and scored vs them. He's scored twice in 2 seasons vs Real Madrid, and those goals weren't flukes either. If you actually watched him last season (2012/13 season) you'd know that even though he didn't score as many goals as this season he was still a terrific striker. Just like anyone that watched Suarez for Ajax knew he would going to be an excellent striker, just like anyone that watched Aguero knew he was going to be an excellent striker.

&gt;In all probability Del Bosque admonished him for this slackness.

So no clear reason and Cesc seems to have snapped at him after being told to leave. Keep in mind that Del Bosque is a prick himself. If Fabregas was being slack, it was probably because Spain are already out of the WC. Why the hell would he want to put in 100% at that point? He was probably just trying to conserve energy for pre-season. Oscar said he was conserving his energy for the World Cup and most people here were fine with that.

In any case, I don't think Del Bosque approves of Cesc's Chelsea move. Before the WC he was one of their top starters. During WC he plays about 20 minutes with about 10 minutes in each match. Plus Del Bosque has been known to prefer Real Madrid and Barcelona players over others. Took him a year after Silva's great season with City to get him into the line up. Mata still hasn't made it despite being one of the best players in EPL in 2012/13.

You seem to mistake ""being passionate about LGBT rights and vocal about them"" for ""letting my sexuality utterly consume me"" and you ignore all my other posts and interests such as music production, politics, art etc. 

I'm just as passionate about politics than I am about LGBT rights. Would you say politics has ""utterly consumed me""? Fuckwit 

Has it ever occured to even if I was straight, my opinions and passion would be exactly the same?

&gt;The only person who takes issue with sexuality is him

This is a blatant lie. 

Funny how gay people are either ""consumed by their sexuality"" and self loathing or have to brush it under the rug completely and pretend it doesn't exist, otherwise they aren't confident and happy.

Apparently you can't be comfortable in your sexuality and outspoken. Only self loathers speak about LGBT issues according to you. Apparently the people who are truly secure in their gayness are the ones who pretend gayness doesn't exist and brush it under the rug, just like you. 

The only people who are secure in their gayness are people who lie through their teeth by pretending sexuality isn't a big part of someone's life and identity and never talk about thier sexuality, like you. 

Apparently the only happy and comfortable queer is a SILENT queer, is that right?

The only confident queer is an INVISIBLE queer, yeah? 

I'm the self loather here and not you? I'm the insecure one? Whatever you say mate! 

I'm pretty sure I'm much, much more secure in my gayness than you are, you grovelling House Queer. 

If I wasn't I wouldn't be as outspoken as I am, instead I'd be licking boots and sucking ass again like you. 

&gt;the guy needs to learn to love himself and realise that what makes him, is him. Not his sexual orientation. 

Stop thinking I'm some self loathing closet case and projecting your own insecurities onto me. I do love my gayness. Maybe not when I was 16 but I'm very happy and comfortable in my gayness now, which is exactly WHY I feel confident enough to speak about it so much, instead of brushing it under the rug.

People who aren't comfortable or secure in their sexuality try to brush it under the rug, and pretend nothing is different, because they're terrified of being rejected by being gay or speaking about gayness. I love being gay, I love speaking out about LGBT issues, and I'm passionate about these issues because they are real and they aren't helped by me pretending they don't exist like yourself. 

My sexual orientation IS a big part of who I am. Anyone who says their sexuality isn't a huge part of their life is a fucking liar, and the only people who say that are scared and insecure House Queers. 

I have other interests and passions other than that. My personality doesn't revolve entirely around my sexuality. Most of my waking thoughts are occupied by my music, art and writing as well as sociology and politics in general, so naturally I am interested in LGBT issues too. Funny how you can have any passion you want, as long as it's not LGBT issues, otherwise you must have a chip on your shoulder. 

So fuck you for telling me I can't be outspoken about LGBT issues without being a self loather, fuck you for trying to gag me to protect your own fragile skin, fuck you for projecting your self loathing onto me, fuck you for trying to stop me speaking about issues and actually try to make the world a better place instead of crawling into an invisible ball like you, fuck you for judging me and gagging me in order to suck up to straight people, fuck you for seriously using the phrase ""shove your agenda down their throat"" and enabling homophobia, and fuck you for making me look bad by being such a snivelling, boot licking, ass kissing Know Your Place queer and making it impossible for us to gain respect by being so utterly pathetic in your ass kissing. 


The reason I am so outspoken is because most gay people like you AREN'T. Someone has to do it. 

I spent a good 10 years getting to the point where I was actually confident enough in my sexuality to say what I think and being able to be outspoken instead of holding my tongue, and now everyone thinks I'm outspoken because of the opposite!! WTF?

Also, LOL @ you judging me for bringing up my sexuality but then you tack on ""From a Gay Guy"" at the end of your post. It's alright for you to bring up your sexuality when it helps you look like a Good Gay in front of the kool kids, isn't it House Queer? I don't give a shit if you're also gay, just because you're gay doesn't mean your opinion is somehow more valid, especially when it's coming from a self loathing Know Your Place queer who's desperate for the approval of heterosexuals anyway. 

People like me speak out so you don't have to, and if people like me never spoke out gay rights would have have advanced and you'd be fucking dead mate. If you want to shuffle to the back of the bus and keep your head down and kiss up to heterosexuals by parroting their little soundbytes you go ahead, but don't judge me for actually having the guts to speak out or for being passionate about something.

true,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,"&gt;Thanks for your brilliant input as usual /u/notsoyoungpadawan . How would I have ever known that Suarez was on the same level as Suarez.
(And I really hope you didn't mean to say Costa, because if so that is completely and utterly false. Suarez would have won POTY last season had it not been for his ban, he scored 23 goals in 33 appearances in the league.)

Firstly, yes obvious typo. Secondly, yes I meant Costa. And like I said, if you had actually watched him you would not be here quoting stats alone to prove your point.

&gt;I think you are the one who fails to understand the basic concept here. I know it was the same area he injured. But he kept reinjuring it because he never let it heal, which would lead to multiple injuries of the same part of the body. If you injure your hamstring and then rest one week and are able to run again, but instead of resting more you rush and **play and after 45min you hurt it again thats no longer 1 injury, that is 2**, even if it the same exact part of the body.

What on Earth.

&gt;You can't keep playing with a hamstring tear. If it tears than you will have difficulty walking which is why he hobbled off the field each time he re injured it. If you saw him able to run again that means the injury healed to some extent. But eventually it would tear again, which is what kept happening. If you tear your hamstring again its another injury.

Yeah no shit. If you break your arm and let it heal for just 1 week then go do a set of bench press and break it again thats the same god damn injury and not a separate injury despite having let it semi-healed.

&gt;Hmm, please explain to me what other top clubs are interested in signing Costa? Yes, that is what I thought.

Err, both Arsenal and Liverpool want him. In fact Liverpool had a bid accepted for Costa last summer but he rejected them.

&gt;This is the problem though. Ask any Atletico fan, they don't feel the same about Costa the way they did about Forlan, Torres, Aguero, R. Falcao. Costa was great but very few think that he can do what he did in Spain this season elsewhere. With the most of those other strikers however, they felt those guys could only get better.

Costa has scored more goals in this season than Torres ever did for them in any 1 season.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"To a certain extent you are probably right that the US system has an element of ""gaming"" the insurance mechanics, but I definitely don't think its as straightforward as that;

MRI is a classic example. It is excellent for visualizing soft tissues and for cancers in particular (which generally occur in soft tissue spaces) it is superior to CT. It also carries far less risk than CT, and indeed a lot of new evidence is coming out to suggest that CT scans actually **cause** a significant minority of cancers by exposing people to high doses of ionising radiation (a CT scan of the chest for example is an equivalent exposure of around 300 x-rays). The risks of MRI are relatively minor in comparison, like a miniscule chance of developing an intravenous MRI contrast allergy. 

We **should** use MRI all the time, there is no reason not to. If we had enough scanners, and enough people to look at the images it would make sense to put everyone through an MRI scanner every 3-5 years or so for cancer surveillance. We would find a huge amount of incidental ""nothings"" along the way, but over time our understanding of how to interpret the images would improve enormously - to help identify those growths that need intervention and those that are just benign. It would also give us a clue when people are starting to develop anatomical problems like diverticulae giving them time to adjust their diet before they end up with full blown diverticular disease.

But we don't use MRI, and even in cases where MRI is the **best** first line imaging technique, we often don't use it first line. Why? Because CT is more available in most hospitals - even though it exposes people to a significant risk of developing cancer further down the line.  Generally the CT scanners in most hospitals are run 24 hours a day, whereas the MRI only runs 9-5 monday to saturday even in a large teaching hospital/foundation trust. Secondly, if you can actually get an MRI slot it costs around twice as much as a CT to run.

So the **tl;dr:** is you are right... But if the US health industry is guilty of over-investigating to make money, then the NHS is guilty of under-investigating to save money... and the statistics show that when it comes to cancers the US approach works better for patients.
