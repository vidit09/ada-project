I do hope you're right and we won't need the investment, but I would say that regards the Soton comparison - Lallana would go (if he goes) for £25M plus (from what I've read about Liverpool's enquiries).

I think rather that we could do with spending that much next season and then, absolutely, sitting back and consolidating, as you said.

If I started earning from a new agency I had to fill out another form with all their details - most of this did not really fit casual work- but still.I also had to let my local council know each month if I got any pay and then they would send me a 20 page letter (literally 20pages) explaining how much housing benefit that meant. Then the next month I would go through the whole thing again to say I got no pay so they could recalculate and sent me another 20 pages.

I agree that we could have spent more wisely. And I do think we'll need heavy initial investment (as in maybe a 40m outlay) but I genuinely believe it is sustainable to spend much less per year afterwards. Especially with the FFP thing restricting teams now.

The Southampton comparison was twofold. Firstly a comparison to show that it might be possible to spend low even if we lose our better players. Secondly a comparison to us four years ago.

When I said continuation, I merely meant, as opposed to a break in membership. We have MEPs, we have staff based there, our government has formal and informal links with the EU. We already meet all of the acquis by dint of our membership - all Scots law must be in line with EU law already, so it's not as though we need to meet the criteria. Of course some things would have to change - we'd need a commissioner, we'd need to be factored into the presidential rotation, we'd have to double our MEPs and such, but in the grand scheme of things, that's not a lot of work.

However if you go this route due to conscience or whatever make sure you tell them in advance and get all the paper work sorted, as well as having proof of the amount you're going to earn. If you just walk into the interview and say you've done some work, or they are put in a situation where they have to take your word for the amount you'll earn, they'll most likely freeze your claim and make you reapply meaning you'll probably lose even more money than you earn doing the two days work with the time it takes for them to get their act together and reinstate your claim. In my experience, since the recession the primarily role of people in the job centre is getting people's benefits stopped for whatever reason they can muster, whether that be being 10 minutes late for an interview, not having sufficient evidence that you are seeking work or engaging in any activity that remotely sounds like work regardless of whether you are actually able to support yourself.

true,steefen7,null,null,"Yeah I saw this too and thought it was complete crap. Beyond the fact that this ""blogger"" cites one mistake the player made years ago as the reason why he fails to make the mark, Fabregas is the go-to scapegoat for Barca fans or media whenever they want to find something or someone to blame for their perceived decline. Some fans will point out the other issues with the structure of the team, but it seems that whenever something isn't going quite right, it's Fabregas' fault.

God knows, we're talking about how the hell we'll replace Luiz in the pairing with Matic and yet Luiz was our most error-prone player along with Ramires this season. Yet everyone on here talked about Luiz' midfield play for us this season as if he was the single greatest midfielder the world had ever seen. He did a fine job breaking up play and that's about it. Not a single goal all season despite being our main free kick taker. The times he was played a CB, he cost of the game. 

Would Fabregas honestly be any worse than any of our other midfielder pairing options? Lampard was finished this year. How many times did he pick up stupid yellows because he was too far out of position and couldn't make up the ground? Ramires was just utter shit. He runs fast. Then he scuffs his shot, slips in the box, or passes to the other team. Mikel, while completely competent and useful to the team, was made redundant the moment we brought in Matic. Again, Luiz was useful, but you always got the feeling that he wasn't providing anything that a true midfielder of real quality couldn't bring. 

If we can't find a way to make our midfield work without playing what essentially becomes two defenders, then the problem isn't a lack of ""steel"". Fabregas has a lot of the same positive qualities we lost when we sold Mata and I think a lot of people on here will agree that once Oscar's form dipped, we lost a lot in terms of our ability to create chances and score. We don't need to concede fewer goals, we had the best defense in the entire league! We need to SCORE more when we are 0-0 or 1-1 with a lower half team and make them open up.

&gt;

&gt;__Francesc ""Cesc"" Fàbregas Soler__ (Catalan: [ˈsɛsk ˈfaβɾəɣəs]; born 4 May 1987) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for [FC Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona) in [La Liga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga), and the [Spanish national team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_football_team). Fàbregas plays mainly as a [central midfielder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder#Central_midfielder) or [attacking midfielder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder#Attacking_midfielder) but has also played as a [winger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder#Winger) or a [second striker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(association_football\)#Second_striker) on some occasions.

&gt;Fàbregas started his career as a trainee with Barcelona but was signed by [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League) side [Arsenal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.) in September 2003 at the age of 16. Following injuries to key midfielders in the [2004–05 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004%E2%80%9305_in_English_football), he went on to establish himself as Arsenal's starting central midfielder, [playmaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker) and [captain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(association_football\)). He broke several of the club's records in the process, earning a reputation as one of the best young players for his position. After protracted transfer negotiations, Fàbregas returned to Barcelona; the Catalan giants signed the midfielder for an initial fee of £35 million with a further £5 million in variables on 15 August 2011.

&gt;In international football, the Spaniard's national career began when he represented the Under-17 side at the [2003 FIFA U-17 World Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_FIFA_U-17_World_Championship) in Finland. As a result of his club performances, he was called up to the senior squad in 2006. He has played in the [2006 FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup), [UEFA Euro 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2008), [2010 FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup) and [UEFA Euro 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2012), helping Spain to become eventual winners in the three most recent tournaments, and most notably setting up [Andrés Iniesta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9s_Iniesta) for the winning goal in the [2010 FIFA World Cup Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup_Final) in South Africa.

Train watching by Millenium Point: http://goo.gl/maps/Twtik watch all the trains in and out of the easterly direction from New Street.

Plane watching: Sheldon Country Park: http://goo.gl/maps/Bhl1w move the map down and left and you'll see the path at the end of the runway. Yup, planes over your head. Not the busiest airport but a few an hour. Can be a bit windy up there. Best access via Marston Green then a 15 minute walk into the park.

Nature: Stirchley Nature Centre: http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/naturecentre Only a few £ to get in, surprisingly big. Nearby is Cannon Hill Park which is large, has a pond. I advise not eating at the cafe there. Park has a car park, or 45 or 47 bus from City Centre.

Hill Climbing: Lickey Hills http://goo.gl/maps/d1Mxm Where the pin is is the visitor centre/cafe. To the south are some very hilly quiet woods, don't go after rain. North is a series of hills you can climb and get a decent view. There are a few car parks dotted around, one being on where the pin is, one being on Lickey Road at Cofton Park. 98 or 45 bus from city centre gets you fairly close, or train to Barnt Green then a walk up through the woods. Take plenty to drink - seriously.

More hill climbing: Waseley Hills http://goo.gl/maps/Yw9UO Where the pin is is the entrance and car park. Or catch the 63 bus and a short walk.

Outdoors: Sutton Park http://goo.gl/maps/LZyGU gigantic park. Train and about a mile's walk. I'm sure there are busses but I don't know them.

Canals: Loads. Walk along most of them, city centre also has a couple of tour boats and I definitely definitely recommend the http://www.sherbornewharf.co.uk/ tour if you want a history lesson and a nice meander around the city centre.

City centre also has the birmingham library which is really amazing inside.

Bus prices on travel west midlands (painted red and white): £1 city centre short hop, £1.80 ""short hop"" (like 5 stops) or £2.10 max single fare. £4 ""daysaver"" for unlimited travel all day. No change given. They don't do return tickets.

The mandatory 15% gratuity is a way of raising prices in order to pay the employees a fair wage.  It's explained as a mandatory gratuity so that customers know why the prices are higher.  Otherwise, they'd think that the bar was charging more money but not passing it on to the employees.

In any case, FSG has clearly changed the way the club operates and has worked with the city council of Liverpool to pay the owners fair prices, above market value, and to not have to use CP.

true,DoctorWedgeworth,null,null,"You might want to contact the CAB, but you don't have to pay council tax for a property you no longer live in (unless you own it and it's empty).  

Firstly the reason you owe so much in council tax is because that's the full year amount, and they allow you to pay by instalments *until* you don't pay, at which point they chase for the full amount (with bailiffs). Secondly, why were you back at the place? (I'm not questioning you, but they might).  

Personally, I'd phone them and explain the situation. They'll ask for a new address, and as long as you registered there/were paying council tax (or exempt) they're probably going to drop it.  

But you need to do this *before* it goes to court, and if you can't stop it you definitely need to turn up at court. The court date is a formality to make it legal for them to send this debt to a bailiff. Once the bailiff receives it they'll send letters then start visiting the property (and your new property if they find it on the electoral roll or from a neighbour). Each time they send a letter or visit, costs will be added on. If they find something to levy on (threaten to take for the debt), that's more cost. You do not want to have to deal with getting bailiff costs removed/paid off.  

Just in case you don't sort this quickly enough, I want to give you some advice for dealing with bailiffs:  
- Do not let them into your property. They are within their rights to climb through an unlocked window, open an unlocked door, or pretend to be coming in to, for example, phone the office to check your story. Once they are inside, they can take a blanket levy (ie. write 'everything in the house' on their list of items they can take). They can also come back with the police and a locksmith to gain entry when you're out. If you do not let them in in the first place, they cannot do this.  
- If you have a car, move it a few streets away.  
- If you're unlucky and they do levy against you, they write it up on a green sheet and offer you the chance to sign it (agreeing not to move any of the items). Doing this usually gives you an extra 2-4 weeks before they come back with a van (likely to take a few weeks anyway). I'd advise against it purely because they can charge for the signed walking possession (that's what it's called if you sign), but not for a non-walking possession (if you don't sign - there is still a charge for the visit, but the not the extra 50 quid or so).  
- If you ignore all prior advice, do not think that them taking your goods will clear the debt. I can't say too much, but I've seen something worth around 600 sold at auction for 30, 25 was auctioneers fees and the rest was taken as bailiff fees).  
- Don't explain your story to them. They won't care. The council will tell you to deal with the bailiffs, but if you explain it's their fault not yours, they might let it slide.  

Anyway TL;DR **phone the council tomorrow, and go to court if you have to. They WILL send this to bailiffs if you don't, they do it for every case**",0,1402001525,null,0,false,0,ci051wp,t3_27eunf,t1_ci051wp,t3_27eunf,null,1434110688,9,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,9

true,gonnaloseweight,null,null,"Moving out is definitely scary but if it makes you feel any better, everyone feels that way to start with. I was absolutely desperate to be independent and I moved out as soon as I could, at the age of 18 - and yet I was still absolutely terrified and had no clue what I was doing. Budgeting money is relatively easy it's just being responsible and sticking to your budget that is hard. Cooking food is something you can learn relatively quickly (and is actually quite fun) and taxes are usually taken care of by your employer. Bills are probably the thing I find the most difficult, but once you've set up direct debits, it's pretty much easy.

Maybe Arteta at Arsenal, but they are very rare and when we were trying ""death by football"" he was part of the plan, but Sturridge and Coutinho are both players who came after him and they are at their best when we counter attack.

Also, he is sharper in attacking. Although he can't beat someone down the sideline, his passing is crisper (especially crossing) and his ability to cut in is much stronger (think Shaw). Last season he bagged 3 goals in 27 appearances. Most Sevilla fans rate him very high. 

Not many people know about him, and I would say that's mostly because of his position, there's a scarcity of quality left-backs on the market and forwards/midfielders steal the headlines of younger players. He's going to be something special in the next 2-3 years.

The only borderline legitimate reason for a secret trial would be if the only way a conviction could be reached would be to give away something absolutely critical to the operation of government.  For example: showing that the accused had secret keys to launch nuclear missiles.

I say ""borderline"" as even these cases should be in public if possible.  Even if it means dropping some charges, there must be enough ancillery charges that could be brought to put the person in prison that the main issue could be discretely withdrawn entirely.  This way both justice and national security is served without conflict.

However I suspect that the above isn't the case in this case, if The Guardian report can be believed that is.  One of the accused is charged with possessing a document called ""bombmaking"" - depending on the contents this might very well be illegal - but surely this isn't enough for a secret trial?

Have to say I always thought he was a bad choice to move to Barca and considered him a natural fit at Real Madrid where they played with direct incisive football. Also thought the natural fit the other way was Xabi Alonso, who fits Barca's style of possession football really well.

As to defensive abilities, he understands space and closing down percentages well (especially having played at barca) so would be able to control space well and intercept where necessary. There's no reason for him to tackle a lot and break up play which Matic and/or Ramires/Chalobah could be in the team to do.

We had literally every other piece of the puzzle and similar to Liverpool, we were missing that one key bit and it kept us out. 

Liverpool had defensive liabilities, which then morphed over the season into this open disdain for defending that just fed back into their original problem. That 3-3 Palace game was the perfect example. Obsessed with attacking, tired themselves out, seemingly decided not to defend and paid for it with the title. 

Meanwhile, we had nearly the exact opposite. After the Matic purchase, the team finally became balanced on the defending side of things, but as soon as Oscar dipped and Hazard got hurt, we had no one else to rely on to make things happen. We simply didn't have enough reliable creators to keep things rolling if Hazard and Oscar weren't playing well. We began playing progressively more defensively every week until Sunderland happened, which was our own damn fault. 

The fact that anyone would think that our problem is that we don't have a defensively strong enough midfield just blows my mind. No one plays a two-man midfield with two defensive minded players and wins the league, absolutely no one.

It's literally a chinese latern, that moves right across the sky within about 2minutes.. the timing of the title of this post was really accurate, think it was exact. 

Amazing sight to see. Believe it or not, I've saw it before. Me and my mate were drunk having a joint in the back and saw it fly over head, thinking 'WTF' I thought it was aliens and was waving to it and shouting and shit. Came on reddit and posted in this sub, other subs, looked online. People said it was the ISS but I didn't believe them, thought 'wut'.

But the timing of this, and how it appeared in the sky just then confirms it was indeed the same thing I saw. Mad how we've put that up there. And America has paid for like 80percent of the money for that.

I know this subreddit is very pro EU anti US, but I really do love the US man they put that in the sky not the EU. 

And I like the people more than the French. LULZ

Beautiful sight. If I was in work tomorrow I'd be in bed too. That has made me happy. Bit weird how you just see things like that and in the same respect, as much as I vote UKip, an immigrant in work has just been promoted and mate, although 'unskilled' (or unqualified) he is genuinely an asset to our country and I'd sign forms saying to keep him here, I even vote UKip. He's a great guy. We had a deep discussion and I realised I don't know what I want out of life, how much money is 'enough', how much is 'too much', and how hard are you prepared to work how many hours are you prepared to put in etc... had that discussion with him, then saw a US (international because they're nice like that - it's really a US space station) fly overhead tonight.

F2 - All units (creep + chen/enc)

F3 - Most useful neutrals (troll or centaur)

http://www.restoration-team.co.uk

Unfortunately, some of the most amazing recent feats aren't really documented here -- like the color restoration of Mind of Evil. This serial only existed as a black-and-white film print for foreign sales, but a close associate of the RT managed to develop a new piece of software to extrapolate the original color from a pattern of noise embedded in the monochrome signal. All that left was general cleanup (both of the picture and the color information) and hand colorization of the one episode where these ""chroma dots"" were actually filtered out as they were supposed to have been.

This technique is also applied to various levels of success to single episodes of Planet of the Daleks and Invasion of the Dinosaurs which previously were only available in color, but Mind is the real revelation as this is the first time since 1971 that anyone has seen any of it in color.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjJBy9mJeCA

Several of the early stories that exist in part, but have missing episodes, have had those episodes animated to fit the surviving audio tracks -- again to varying levels of success but usually to a very high standard. The Moonbase and The Invasion are particular standouts.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUdZd43hxgk

Still other stories have been released in enhanced edits, with The Curse of Fenric and Battlefield being hugely improved by the replacement of cut scenes and a re-edit to original script order. The stories actually make sense, unlike their broadcast versions! The Day of the Daleks got an extra disc with improved special effects, just for the fun of it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rlss3Krt7g

Just about every disc has something rather amazing about it, and as time went on they basically kept upping their game with every passing year. It's a shame that they ran out of material just when they reached the pinnacle that they did!

Even their first pass at Spearhead from Space was a revelation, compared to the grotty old print that had gone out on VHS (itself a vast improvement on the nth generation syndication print you'll find on Netflix). They've revisited it twice since then, on DVD and then just recently on Blu-Ray.

true,aderack,troughton,Troughton,"I wouldn't over-emphasize the lost episodes. They're all contained within the show's first six years, and mostly within seasons 3-5. Which is to say, seasons 1-2 are very nearly complete; season 6 is just about complete, and then seasons 7-26 are all present and accounted for. 

So if you're watching any Doctor after Troughton, you're fine. If you watch Hartnell's first two seasons or Troughton's last, you're pretty much fine. It's only in the transition between Hartnell and Troughton that things get a little weird. 

It's also worth noting that any mostly-complete serial with missing episodes has had them animated or reconstructed for DVD release. You mostly won't find these in syndicated or streaming editions. 

Also, the streaming editions are mostly sourced from hideous decades-old syndication prints that really don't show the episodes in their best light. Anything before early Tom Baker is almost unwatchable in its Netflix incarnations, and after that it's still washed out, with tinny audio. I'd avoid those unless you're very desperate or morbidly curious.

Go for the DVDs.

EDIT: Actually, I'm really impressed with Hulu's organization! They actually list most of the surviving Hartnell episodes, and they categorize them correctly! When there's a gap in numbering, they acknowledge it.

But Real is a difficult team to be a star and carry games when you have a team of stars and world class players, besides Modric and Di maria were superb this year. I'm saying that I think that a move to City would have suit him best because he'll have more playing time and Peller's knows and trust him. Of course all of this based on my assumptions and impressions, so maybe Isco would've ended in the bench, we'll never know. 

In the next World Cup, spain will need Isco, a lot of their stars are getting old. 

Carvajal and Llorente are interesting cases.

It was! It glued my eyelashes together (almost). [Have a look at these](http://imgur.com/a/rw3Ro) and you'll get the idea. 

&gt;I'm about 2/3s of the way through my Sally Hansen top coat so I'm in the market for another.

How are you finding it? My nails chipped almost immediately in the morning, but only two of them, so I think it's more the condition of the ends of those two nails, because I had a shitty emery board and they grow so quickly I resorted to cutting them with toenail clippers and they tend to split. No more now I have the wonderful crystal one!

&gt;Nail update though: I've thrown caution to the wind, and I've been wearing turquoise polish to work.

Hurrah! &lt;3

Aww, I wish my nails were short enough. I can get away with grey and that's just about it, anything else just looks tragic. I love the cheapy-cheap MUA nail varnishes in Superdrug for constantly changing colours, although I'm not sure they have the more 'out there' ones. Speaking of which, I'm overdue a splurge - I'll report back later with pictures.

true,stop___grammar_time,silver,Silver,"&gt;In ""The Long Game"", Adam Mitchell gets a brain implant and attempts to communicate future information to his answering machine in the past.

He attempted to communicate *all of human knowledge at that point in time for personal gain* to the past. It's a bit worse than you're making it out to be, he isn't just beaming back the blueprints to the new iphone or something.

1. Adam Mitchell's story [comics spoiler](#s ""gets wrapped up in the 50th anniversary comic mini series ""Prisoners of Time""."") Ignoring that, perhaps removing it would have proved fatal. The Doctor wouldn't kill Adam over having a bit of essentially useless future tech - IIRC the purpose of the implant was to essentially turn the human brain into a processor, sorting the feed from the high density information beam and relaying pertinent information back into the system. Without the satellite's computers, it's a chunk of metal in his skull. And whenever Adam dies, the Doctor can travel to that point and retrieve it.  
The tech was also a deterrent for Adam not to talk about his adventures with the Doctor. The whole point to the conclusion of that episode was that Adam was doomed to live an ultimately benign life, unable to live to his full potential out of fear that he would be captured by a government or a similar agency to the one he used to work for and dissected.

2. The Doctor generally saves more people than those who die. It's like having a choice between intervening and letting 5 people die, or not doing anything and letting 500.  
As for the timeline: It's been shown time and again that with the exception of fixed points, the web of time is elastic. It allows for an amount of meddling, you can change a few things here and there without any drastic consequence to the big picture. As the oldest time traveling race in the galaxy, the Time Lords would presumably know the limits of tampering better than any other species.  
Besides, he's not just running around screwing with things. Most of the time he's off being a tourist or exploring, as the audience we only get to see the exciting bits.

Exactly. Maybe she shouldn't have attached herself to a chair then. Typical play acting ala YouTube, where people literally say ""ow"", and presumably dogs actually say ""woof"".

If I read it correct, they bought shares in the company seemingly for the whole reason that they could protest at the AGM? So they are also profiting indirectly from the very thing they accuse the company of being involved in?

They'd only be minority shareholders at best, thus making their ""right to protest"" disproportionate to the amount of time they wasted at the AGM for the number of shares they held. I'm not sure holding shares gives you any more right than to attend the AGM and comment on the agenda - not redefine the agenda to whatever you want.

Can won't play DM in our system. He has athleticism, energy and pace, but he's too erratic in possession, doesn't read the game well yet, and likes to dribble and take players on. It would be both a waste of his talents and a bad fit for our team to use him as the defensive midfielder in our system. Lucas fits the role much better and did an excellent job in that position through December - January last season.

Can fits much better as one of the two ahead of the DM, along with Henderson and Allen (as well as Coutinho and Lallana, but they're slightly different). The Henderson/Allen role is extremely physically demanding and requires pace, physicality and energy as well as technical qualities. So it's the position on the pitch most requiring depth and we absolutely need more than just Henderson and Allen there.

All this is based on us keeping the same system, if we go back to the double pivot things may change but I don't see that as too likely.",0,1402036063,null,0,false,0,ci0ikbb,t3_27g6uq,t1_ci0ikbb,t3_27g6uq,null,1434117126,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

He played a gig at our Uni back in the early nineties.  This was a few years before the scandals broke and he was still regarded as a bit of a glam superstar.   I was in the stage crew so I got to hang out with him a bit.  From the little I saw, he seemed like a genuinely nice bloke.  He was one of the more famous people I'd worked with but I recall he made a point of coming around at the end and personally thanking each of us for our hard work, etc.  It's sadly something that few artists remember to do but makes a big impression.

Secondly, many calculations assume recycling of fuel in reactors, some assume undiscovered resources, new extraction techniques, new technologies, etc.  Thirdly, some make economic arguments suggesting that as easy-to-access resources dwindle, prices go up making more complicated extraction technologies economically viable.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"Depends where Rodgers sees Can playing most frequently - DM, box-to-box CM, or LB?

From what I've seen and read about Can, box-to-box CM is the best fit. Right now we have Henderson, Allen and Coutinho - not enough cover for 2 positions when we're in 4 competitions, especially when Coutinho is also needed as an AM. We saw this season that Lucas absolutely shouldn't play there.

Without knowing what Rodgers has in mind, it's hard to say what this means for Lucas. Lucas might still leave if FSG think his wages - that of a first XI player - no longer match his contribution to the squad - a squad option who can really only play in one position. Yes, he's quality in that position, but is that enough to justify keeping him?

It also depends on how willing Rodgers is to have Gerrard play multiple games a week. Keep in mind, Gerrard's exceptional creativity from the DM position has been masking the lack of creativity from players like Henderson and Allen at CM - Henderson has his moments, but isn't consistently creating chances, and even less so for Allen. That's one reason Lallana's a better option than Shaqiri - Lallana can play CM and offer creativity from a deeper position, Shaqiri not so much.

TL;DR: No idea. Depends on whether FSG/Rodgers see keeping Lucas as value for money, and what their plans are for Can and Gerrard.",0,1402038905,null,0,false,0,ci0j78h,t3_27g6uq,t1_ci0j78h,t3_27g6uq,null,1434117426,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

true,Melberger,null,null,"I'm going to go against the grain a bit: I'm not sure this is a wise move by the club.

Nasri, while a good player, is inconsistent. He rarely stands out in a game, and is usually just someone who contributes sparingly. This season however, he has improved, and performed more consistently than in previous seasons - however that really isn't saying much. That said, this year has been his best at City. But I still have doubts about him.

He rarely influences a game the way David Silva does, for example.

Regardless of the fixture, you can always rely on David to have a strong influence on a game, on the tempo and our attacking threat. Sometimes he's spectacular, sometimes he's so-so, but he is never a passenger. He's one of those players you can rely on to consistently perform week in week out.

Nasri, on the other hand, is too often a passenger. Way too often.

He's 27 years old this month, and he's one of the highest earners at the club.

I don't think we get value for money out of Nasri for circa £170k a week, and in the current climate where FFP rules, I think it's a key consideration. A contract extension would see a raise on that £170k a week.

Put it this way: if we could sign a young and upcoming talent, who has Nasri's talent, but performs more consistently - we'd have a better player, who has room for further development, would be on a lower wage, and would have a greater resale value.

For example, if we'd have signed Isco last summer, he would've been that player.

If we give Nasri a new contract now, we'd increase his wage, and his resale value will be lower in a couple of years as he'd be almost 30.

Also, Nasri is the kind of player who only raises his game when he feels slighted or believes he has something to prove, when he doesn't he too often becomes a passenger.

His best form in his career was in 2010 at Arsenal when he was snubbed by France to play at the World Cup, he wanted to prove he was good enough to play at that level. Likewise, his best form here was this year, desperate to prove he could play for France in this summer's World Cup.

I think, with the rumours of him retiring from international football, and given a new contract, we could see the passive Nasri who doesn't push himself. The passenger who frustrates you, the player that drove Mancini mad.

I don't know, I'm open to discussion about this, and I'd welcome debate. But I'm just a bit cautious about Nasri, and I worry about giving him a new contract.",0,1402040157,null,0,1402043301,0,ci0jgaa,t3_27do8n,t1_ci0jgaa,t3_27do8n,null,1434117544,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1

The Doctor is a psychic vampire.

Not literally. Emotionally. He's old, and worn out. He's bored. He's seen it all, done it all, and it just keeps going and going and it's always the same and people never learn and... *huffs*

So to avoid the morbid depression that is his existence, he looks at the universe through someone else's eyes. Their reactions, their fear, their excitement, it's enough to pierce his ennui. It's enough to give him motivation, to let him go on a little bit longer.

While he's getting what he needs, he'll move heaven and earth for them. But once it dries up, once he starts to feel the black creeping back up on him, he drops them off, goes into a bit of a funk, and then finds someone else to start it all over again.

[Subside](http://www.subsidebar.com/) is probably your first stop, more of a bar than a nightclub but it has a dance floor which picks up later on and fills all of the criteria of being cheap, sticky, plays rock and metal and is open till 6 in the morning if you like staying out!

For a dedicated nightclub you'll want [Eddies](http://www.eddiesrocks.com/), although it is currently going through a change in management so might not be open for the next couple of weekends, I am good friends with most the staff there though (I've been a regular for 3 years), so if you want to double check before you go just drop me a message and I'll let you know if it's open or not. It is a bit more expensive than subside though.

I see [Uprawr](http://www.totaluprawr.com/about-uprawr-birmingham/) has been mentioned a lot, and while it is very cheap the music certainly doesn't appeal to everybody in our musical community. I know for myself I prefer my rock and metal classic or heavy, whereas Uprawr is more metalcore, pop-punk and the odd bit of dubstep.

Also worth considering is [Scruffy Murphys](http://scruffymurphys.co.uk/), a rock/metal pub with a great atmosphere, but lacking in anywhere to dance or headbang (although you'll often find a few people in the middle of the pub floor giving it a try), and is also on the slightly more expensive side.

Similar to Scruffys is the [Flapper](http://www.theflapper.co.uk/), another excellent rock pub with a good atmosphere too, and which does a much better job of disguising itself than these other dirty rock bars haha!

Other places I've seen people bring up are Snobs, which while it may play some rock music, I've certainly never heard any on my odd adventures into there, it being mostly dominated by chart music and a fun little 80s pop room, and it has a reputation for being full of underage drinkers, but you'll struggle to find anywhere cheaper.

true,john_locke1689,,Belfast. Mayonnaise.,"There is a matter of trust, while she may agree with Sinn Fein on a myriad of other things there is the minor issue of Sinn Fein's official stance that every now and then it's okay to kill someone you disagree with. Not to mention that their economic policy is kinda crap, and the more people who vote for Sinn Fein in other elections the stronger their case for a border poll. And while at an executive level they have some well spoken and somewhat competent people, many of them are quite dodgy, then there is their members at a local level that may be even more so.

While I don't trust the DUP I certainly trust Sinn Fein to act against the my best interests and what's best for Northern Ireland.

As for the amount of Unionists that buy into it, the DUP changed the rule about who becomes first minister. Previously it was a member from the largest designation, so until there were more nationalists than unionists the first minister would come from a unionist party. Now the DUP successfully changed that so its the biggest party (which is less representative of the country as a whole) with this change they now have manufactured a situation where they can threaten the legitimacy and democracy itself by saying, you can't vote for, TUV UKIP or UUP, as otherwise Sinn Fein may get in, where this may actually make the problem worse.",0,1402040813,null,0,1402042199,0,ci0jklq,t3_27dle2,t1_ci0jklq,t1_ci0h5cq,null,1434117600,-1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,-1

It was a positions designed to purposefully dismantle attacks and win back posession but as our team as a whole has made so much progress, with even players like Coutinho and Sterling stepping up to embrace the pressure all over the pitch philosophy that role became a bit redundant.

Why tell one guy to sit back and wait for the team to attack when the other 10 guys will just squeeze the ball back anyways right? Instead BR put Gerrard at the base and basically converte him into a deep play-maker, he uses his pass range effectively while at the same time shielding the back 4 when there's pressure.

Now that we operate with a deep playmaker, an advanced playmaker (Coutinho/Sterling) and one box-to-box (Hendo), Lucas is left out simply because he doesn't particularly excel at any one of those roles.

However he's still the best defensive CDM we have here, but for right now all he can do is provide cover for Gerrard. He got a run-out in Hendo's spot for a few games but wasn't really convincing. So honestly its hard to tell what BR is thinking. I think he'll stay because he happens to be a central piece in BR's other system which we can deploy in case of injuries.

There were a whole bunch of abandoned cars in dense bushland near our property. No idea how they got there or why they were there. My father used to take me on walks to go see the cars. 

At the time they must have been fairly new. Strange that I never, until this very moment, thought about why they were there. 

When I was old enough to go on these walks by myself, I used to play in these cars, smash them up, check out the engines, etc. Most of them had personal belongings and other stuff scattered around as various people would come across these cars and have their own fun with them.

Christ, they could have been part of a mass murder or a hitch hiker killing spree for all I know. 

BTW, where I grew up was right down the road from [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpacker_murders). So, yeah, not impossible those cars could have been part of something sinister.

&gt;

&gt;In [politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics) and [sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology), __divide and rule__ (or __divide and conquer__) (derived from [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language): διαίρει καὶ βασίλευε, *diaírei kaì basíleue*) is gaining and maintaining power by breaking up larger concentrations of power into pieces that individually have less power than the one implementing the strategy. The concept refers to a strategy that breaks up existing power structures and prevents smaller power groups from linking up.

&gt;The maxims *divide et impera* and *divide ut regnes* were utilised by the Roman ruler [Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar) and the Corsican emperor [Napoleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon). The example of [Gabinius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aulus_Gabinius) exists, parting [the Jewish nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iudaea_Province) into five conventions, reported by [Flavius Josephus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavius_Josephus) in Book I, 169-170 of *The Wars of the Jews* (*De bello Judaico*).  [Strabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabo) also reports in *Geography*, 8.7.3  that the [Achaean League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaean_League) was gradually dissolved under the Roman possession of the whole of [Macedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_(ancient_kingdom\)), owing to them not dealing with the several states in the same way, but wishing to preserve some and to destroy others.

&gt;In modern times, [Traiano Boccalini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traiano_Boccalini) cites ""divide et impera"" in *La bilancia politica*, 1,136 and 2,225 as a common principle in politics. The use of this technique is meant to empower the sovereign to control subjects, populations, or factions of different interests, who collectively might be able to oppose his rule. [Machiavelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machiavelli) identifies a similar application to military strategy, advising in Book VI of *The Art of War*  (*Dell'arte della guerra*),  that a Captain should endeavor with every art to divide the forces of the enemy, either by making him suspicious of his men in whom he trusted, or by giving him cause that he has to separate his forces, and, because of this, become weaker.

&gt;The strategy of division and rule has been attributed to sovereigns ranging from [Louis XI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XI) to [the Habsburgs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburgs). [Edward Coke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Coke) denounces it in Chapter I of the Fourth Part of the *Institutes*, reporting that when it was demanded by the [Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords) and [Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_House_of_Commons) what might be a principal motive for them to have good success in [Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_England), it was answered: ""*Eritis insuperabiles, si fueritis inseparabiles. Explosum est illud diverbium: Divide, &amp; impera, cum radix &amp; vertex imperii in obedientium consensus rata sunt.*"" [You would be insuperable if you were inseparable. This proverb, Divide and rule, has been rejected, since the root and the summit of authority are confirmed by the consent of the subjects.] On the other hand, in a minor variation, [Sir Francis Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon) wrote the phrase ""separa et impera"" in a letter to [James I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_I_of_England) of 15 February 1615. [James Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison) made this recommendation in a letter to [Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson) of 24 October 1787,  which summarized the thesis of *[The Federalist #10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Papers)*:  ""Divide et impera, the reprobated axiom of tyranny, is under certain (some) qualifications, the only policy, by which a republic can be administered on just principles."" In *Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch* by Immanuel Kant (1795), Appendix one, *Divide et impera* is the third of three political maxims, the others being *Fac et excusa* (Act now, and make excuses later) and *Si fecisti, nega* (when you commit a crime, deny it). 

&gt;Elements of this technique involve:

&gt;


&gt;* creating or encouraging divisions among the subjects to prevent alliances that could challenge the sovereign

&gt;* aiding and promoting those who are willing to cooperate with the sovereign

&gt;* fostering distrust and enmity between local rulers

&gt;* encouraging meaningless expenditures that reduce the capability for political and military spending

&gt;Historically, this strategy was used in many different ways by empires seeking to expand their territories.

&gt;The concept is also mentioned as a strategy for market action in [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics) to get the most out of the players in a competitive market.

I mean. Seriously we need to start revolting. Silent protests do not do anything. All you do is clog up a street for a day and then go home and continue the cycle of still being spied on. 

I get that the government says ""Don't worry we don't abuse what we are doing"" But for fuck sake there is not even anyone monitoring this stuff, It's not like we have OfCom making sure these secret employees aren't abusing their power, Because I tell you if I had the metadata of all these people and the ability to listen into conversations without warrants and it was this easy then I would and I hate to say it but I might misclick a few times and listen into people.

I am terrible for doing something like that but humans are naturally curious and this is not good for anyone to have, No matter if your a Christian saint or the devil.

2. Let Brendan Rodgers get at them so that they become world class as Liverpool players. (Other clubs don't have Brendan Rodgers, so Spurs, for example, might put ????? here).

It's a shame with the economy / recession that there aren't as many career type roles currently compared to 'pays the bills' jobs, but beggars can't be choosers. I'm sure things will get better in time.

Nothing wrong with not going to University either, the thing about a degree is that it is simply education, it isn't a meal ticket for the rest of your life. Some people do see it as purely a stepping stone for their career but for others it's not.

Since we don't need everyone to jump into jobs at 18 (we have surplus labour) there's no harm if people choose to stay in education for a few more years. In fact it the income undergraduates bring into Universities actually fund a lot of our research, because central government doesn't fund research massively anymore. So think of university more like an investment in R&amp;D for the country. For some it will improve job prospects, for others it might not. That's okay.

As for bankers, some make it big, some don't. I was looking to get into retail banking after University but the starting salary at Santander was only £17,000, and they don't need a degree.

I mean, by all means I'd take him over Hockaday, but I would still rather have a fresh face with a good track record at this level. Unfortunately most managers like that will rightly want to stay the hell away from Leeds.

When we were in League One, I always thought that McAllister was trying to play pretty football that he could get away with in the Championship, but not on the piss poor narrow pitches you see in League One. Now that we've been in the Championship for a few seasons, I don't think that he would be able to do it here either, with the physicality and lack of playing space inherent in Championship football. The defence was absolutely chronic during his first full season and I can't see him improving it (then again, he won't have Steve Staunton as his assistant), and his judgement of senior players is questionable, considering that he wanted rid of Johnson, a player whom Grayson turned into a key asset over the following two seasons.

That said, one of McAllister's biggest strengths is his ability to work with and develop the youth players, with Delph and Howson being the two best examples, which is something we might have to rely on because I don't see us getting a big transfer kitty and - in fairness - there has been talk about a fair few promising players in the academy. Another positive aspect I would credit to McAllister is his work in the transfer window. I would argue that he has been better at signing players than both Grayson and McDermott. He brought in Snodgrass and Becchio, two discoveries I entirely credit to him (confirmed with Becchio as Macca's contacts with Marcelino, former Newcastle player and present day agent, led to Becchio's trial). However, under the new regime he won't get a say on which players are brought in.

I use an accountant who happens to be some recruitment agencies and he has been very good for me. I would suggest you get some recommendations.

Read up about IR35!

If you are after a car - I was recommended to get a 95 g/km and below car on the company. Company can write off the entire amount in the first year as an expense. You do end up paying BIK (benefit in kind) tax but that should be small being low pollution. Also means company pays for insurance and maintenance as an expense (reducing corp tax bill)

Pensions are an allowable expense - you can get a SIPP and have the company make regular gross payments towards it.

Save on phone bills - get a company mobile phone in company name. Special dispensation exists for BIK and phones.

If you use your home as an office you can ask your accountant to claim special dispensation of around 3 or 4 quid a week for this.

You are allowed an annual staff party up to 75 quid a head (no more else the whole lot is not allowable).

As mentioned before - check out Flat Rate VAT.

You are now cash generative - save your cash. Take what you need from the company to live. Save the rest - then ask your accountant for efficient ways of using the money.

true,nowonmai666,lfc99,null,"I couldn't resist it.

On the serious side, this business of signing future worldies on the cheap is of course what every club just outside the super-rich club wants to be doing.

The owners want to increase the value of the players and sell them at a profit; for some clubs it's the only way they can stay afloat. I'm struggling to remember the name of the Italian club that sells almost all of its first team every summer. Atletico seem to be in that category too.

For the fans it's the dream of being able to compete with the super-rich clubs that have a stranglehold on so many leagues. And for them it's mostly going to be unrealistic, because one top player won't win you the league, and they're not going to stick around long enough to have more than one or two at a time.

Liverpool have a couple of disadvantages in this regard, the main one being not being in London. I tend to feel that players who make their choices based on the lifestyle they'll have outside of the football might not be the ones we want anyway, but it's hard to persuade rich young men to try the less fashionable city.

But we have advantages: we have more money than most, we have our history, we have our fans, we have highly regarded players with immense loyalty to the club (Gerrard, Agger) and most of our former players seem to tell every young player they meet that it's an amazing place to play football. 

We almost did it a few years back: we had Reina playing behind two of Agger/Carragher/Hyypia, a midfield with Alonso and Mascherano and Gerrard and Torres ahead of that.

None of those players was world class when they came in, and whilst maybe only a Liverpool fan would argue that our central defenders were as good as the so-called worldies (but they were!), that was as good a spine as any in Europe; Glen Johnson was the first step in filling out the wide positions with the same sort of quality, but it wasn't to be.

We have two advantages now that we didn't have then: stable, rational ownership and Brendan Rodgers. He is the coach who turned Sturridge and Sterling into the players they are today. He may be the difference between the Suarez who hit the woodwork three times a match and the guy who will get either a hat trick of assists or an actual hat trick as often as not. The third best player in the world, the best English striker, the most exciting young English player, all owe a good deal of it to him.

I know he's a quality player, I didn't dispute that. My argument is that he doesn't represent value for money due to his inconsistency. This season has been his standout at City, but it's taken him two years to show the kind of form he showed while at Arsenal.

Who's to say that he won't go back to his old ways this coming season given that he'll no longer have anything to prove if he's given a new contract and has retired from international football?

That player does exist, I gave you one example and that was Isco.

There will be others.

Yaya isn't a reasonable comparison anyway, as he does perform consistently. Especially in the big games, the same can't be said for Nasri. The League Cup final doesn't disprove that.

But using your Yaya example, we could sell Yaya and replace him with a player like Ross Barkley or Pogba, who have talent in abundance, but not quite to Yaya's current level or consistency. But they'd be on a much smaller contract with the potential to reach Yaya's level or even exceed it. It'd be a gamble, and Yaya would be a huge loss in the short term, but given the alternative is keeping an unhappy player with a questionable attitude at the club - is it worth it?

Same for Nasri. The trade off: Nasri's negatives are his inconsistency and at time questionable attitude. His age and his status as one of the highest paid players at the club. Is he value for money?

His hold-up/link-up play and first touch have been so bad over his time at Everton and West Brom, that he can almost never be used in a single-striker system. This is the main reason why Chelsea keep loaning him out, they are hoping that in time he will pick up these skills. So far he hasn't.

I'm a massive fan of Rickie Lambert, whom i think has some of the best skills and link-up for a big guy (6ft 2in) in the league. Integral to Southampton's style was Rickie dropping deep and knocking balls through to the inside forwards and wingers (JRod, Lallana and co). Simply-put, I think we are going to need a striker like this playing as a 9 at most times. Only one man in our team has currently showed the ability to play like this and that is Adebayor. Whether Kane can play this role is yet to be seen.

For the price we would have to pay for Lukaku (20-30mil), he simply doesn't seem good enough or well-enough suited to the style we will probably employ.

There was another case of them asking when they'd be able to have tea before an assault on a farm.

If you add in details about the fact the film is centred around you cycling from Bristol to Amsterdam. Add in your planned route, how long you think it will take, some of the things you need the funding for, where you plan to take the video, the impact you think it will have.

Seriously add as much detail as you can possibly think of, some people take a lot of convincing so the more you can show them the better chances you have of proving you are worth their time and money.

Also add in a short video too, people love videos, putting a face to a name helps people to connect to your cause and will increase the chances of funding, especially if you can go more into your personal struggle with bipolar and how you feel not enough is being done etc.

Police corruption is a red herring: whether some among the police are corrupt or not makes no odds to their duty regarding groups that may secretly be planning and carrying out crime.

If no charges were brought then no serious crime was going on: I call that good news. Surely though you don't expect every police investigation to result in the discovery of a great and terrible criminal conspiracy? Sometimes the seemingly innocent group really is innocent.

The only cause for concern is the point you raise about confidentiality of police evidence. Certainly information obtained in the course of such investigations ought not to be circulated so freely: but the blacklisting was done by the employers, not the police. Until recently I would have held this to be an outrage against free speech, but lately I've been hearing from more and more liberals that free speech is only about government restrictions, not employers. Freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences and all that. I think it's to justify sacking people for opposing gay marriage. So now I don't know _what_ to think.

true,goolies,null,null,"&gt;Almost half of graduates won't earn enough to pay back the full amount, so even if the very wealthy exploit this trick they'll still be paying more than low and middle earners.

I don't think that's a correct assumption. People can fail to fully pay off their loans (which the article is referring to) whilst still paying more than those paying up-front. Remember that the loan compounds at RPI +3% whilst a student and at a variable rate of RPI + up to 3% depending on salary whilst earning. Therefore somebody who fails to pay off the full amount - i.e. some of the 45% in the BBC article - due to the accumulating interest may still pay more than those who pay up front (even once inflation is accounted for - thanks to the accumulation of interest at above RPI).


&gt;and certainly not ""horribly regressive""


I should have made it clearer but I when I said ""horribly regressive in this regard"" I meant in that it excludes the wealthiest, I agree the system is mostly progressive when considering those of less phenomenal income who pay the debt off in accordance to the repayment scheme.


&gt;This would prevent the unnecessary fear and confusion


We've totally ignored the fact that the scheme now places graduates in &gt;£50,000 of debt - the terms of repayment of which may be changed by any future government. I think in this sense some of the fear may be justified!

**Edit:**
&gt;The very rich will in some cases pay less than the quite rich

I think this is another point that you've rather glossed over. Whilst we've become accustomed to tax evasion by the very rich - to have it permitted by and written into the terms of what's been praised as 'essentially a graduate tax' is really, really, not OK. If the government had excluded early repayment - or you know, actually implemented a graduate tax - perhaps the financial pickle whereby they are expected to lose money through this scheme could have been avoided.",0,1402053883,null,0,1402054337,0,ci0lpmy,t3_27e7lw,t1_ci0lpmy,t1_ci0ljmb,null,1434118609,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,JDCrawford48,,Mid-Ulster,"Thank you! Another wall of text incoming.

First, we must look at what is required in order for a United Ireland to occur.
 
1. A nationalist majority in Northern Ireland.

2. A stable and effective economy within Ireland.

Under these circumstances a United Ireland is likely to occur, however the Unionist and Loyalist community who are now the largest minority would begin to feel under threat of being controlled by Dublin and a very large Nationalist/Roman Catholic majority.

An under threat community is like a cornered animal, they will strike out, and from this sectarian attacks would increase and likely the UDA/UVF would become more active.

Is it possible to stop this from happening? **No.** However it *is* possible to limit the damage. A few key decisions should help the unionist community to feel more comfortable within a United Ireland.

1. Any person is allowed to designate their nationality. Allow unionists to retain their identity of Britishness.

2. The orange order and the twelfth marches are allowed to continue under the conditions that proper dialogue be taken in flash areas.

3. The unionist/protestant community is given a proper, and **effective** voice in law making.

4. Recruitment of police officers in the 6 counties **must** remain 50/50 and the name of the police should not be the Garda. This means a separate police force for the 6 counties. 

5. Ireland should consider entry into the commonwealth/closer ties with the United Kingdom.

6. Restructuring of the parliaments is a necessity - This was always going to happen anyway. 

With these six points, the majority of unionist concerns are covered. They will still be British, Protestantism will not be attacked, They will not be persecuted or controlled entirely by Dublin. The police will remain a neutral force within the community.

Basically, don't make the mistakes that unionists made when partition began. Similarly, unionists must not make the same mistake the Nationalist community made when partition began. Unionists must partake fully in any government that is set-up, immediately.  

With this, the moderate unionist community and even some more hard-liners will be inclined to feel comfortable, preventing them from moving to the extreme and committing violence.

There is no doubt that a United Ireland will result in a spike of sectarian attacks, this may last months, it may even last years. No-one has said a United Ireland would be easy.

Now lets look at the Nationalist/Roman Catholic community. Many people assume that removing Britain from Ireland would make this community suddenly happy and content. No Britain = No problem. This is simply not true, the sectarian divide will still be there and there will still be sectarian disputes/fights between both communities. 

However I do expect the IRA and the Dissidents to begin to cease actions, if they don't, then I expect that both the Garda and the police in the 6 counties would hunt them with the same intensity as they would hunt the unionist paramilitaries. 

Being a Unionist myself, my knowledge of the Nationalist/Roman Catholic community is admittedly heavily lacking. 

The above points are for the short term. Looking at a longer term solution will require that education is non-biased and is integrated. The segregation of communities should be actively discouraged in order to foster better community relations. Joint-community events and celebration of both cultures should happen. Children should not be taught about ""us and them"" etc... 

Sorry about another wall of text, I hope you found this post to be as equally unbiased and level-headed as the last. This is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to a United Ireland, and I could write for hours. Looking at a sustainable solution should partition remain will require another separate post.

*TL;DR if the unification of Ireland is correctly achieved so as not to alienate the Unionist community, sectarianism will occur, this cannot be stopped, but it will not last.*

&gt; The second is “date rape”.  Imagine that a woman voluntarily goes to her boyfriend’s apartment, voluntarily goes into the bedroom, voluntarily undresses and gets into bed, perhaps anticipating sex, or naïvely expecting merely a cuddle.  But at the last minute she gets cold feet and says “Stop!”.  The young man, in the heat of the moment, is unable to restrain himself and carries on.

&gt; In both cases an offence has been committed, and the perpetrators deserve to be convicted and punished.  But whereas in the first case, I’d again be quite happy to hang the guy, I think that most right-thinking people would expect a much lighter sentence in the second case.  Rape is always wrong, but not always equally culpable.

&gt; Let me make another point which will certainly get me vilified, but which I think is important to make: **while in the first case, the blame is squarely on the perpetrator and does not attach to the victim, in the second case the victim surely shares a part of the responsibility**, if only for establishing reasonable expectations in her boyfriend’s mind.

&gt; Sounds good to me, shame we're so invested in fossil fuels.

We aren't terribly.  The big problem with electric cars is storing the energy is hard, really hard.

Fossil Fuels have a wonderfully low cost, the energy stored is very high, and getting to it is incredibly easy.  As such moving away from it isn't hard because of previous capital expenditure, it's that the new projects are expensive.  Our new nuclear power plants are going to cost quite a lot, meanwhile, wind or solar is very, very expensive because of that pesky storage problem.  Fission power (my personal favourite) doesn't really respond well to demand, the fission is happening, but a lot of the Fossil Fuel generators spin up and down quite fast, this means we aren't spending money when people don't want the electricity.

A decade ago I was doing a science summer school project with a bunch of rather gifted kids, I was shocked at how they'd been given some fossil fuels are bad reteric, they were completely ignorant of why fossil fuels are so damned useful.  Fossil fuels currently can not be matched in many kinds of versatility, we shouldn't try to compete with them on that respect, we should use the renewables were we can get maximum benefit.

To give you an idea of how useless my solar panels are, they would take just under 2 days to charge a Tesla model S, and that is with our very long days at the moment.  These are fairly high end panels, that cost me £12k 4 years ago, and I stuck on my parents roof in Cornwall.  Now obviously, if I bought my parents a tesla model S as well, they'd probably want to drive it during the time it can be charged, so I'd need a battery to store the energy for the battery in the car, swapping the car's battery would be prohibitively expensive.  Now this 'intermediate' battery, let's pretend we can get some of the best efficency possible, it would probably only add 2 hours more light needed.

This is the thing, a car has such a huge energy requirement, but compare it to my parents house, that they don't use 1kW of power most of the day, light bulbs are energy saver, TV / Computer / Stereo are biggest power draws.

If everyone switched to electric cars?  Let's have some fun speculating.  A very quick duckduck gives this DFT number

&gt;Car traffic was 243.8 billion vehicle miles in 2010

Cool.  Now a Tesla Model S apparently takes ~300Wh to do a mile, let's run with that figure.

(243.8/365)*300Wh = ~200

So that gives us 200 billion Watt Hours a day needed.  That's a lot.
Assuming the billion from the dft is a yanky one (ergh)
200,000,000,000Wh is needed.
That's 200GWh!   Okay, let's pretend it's really efficient and slowly charged, so look at that over a day.  8GW demand....  This is unrealistic because it assumes that no one is driving their car, only charging them, so lets assume its 50/50 split, 16GW.  Now let's have a look at our power usage today! 
http://www.gridwatch.templar.co.uk/

Oh yeah.  So that 16GW, that is about 5 times the capacity of our new nuclear plants planned for Hinckley.

This is before we get into the national grid, 'super charging' (very inefficient) etc.  Oh also, this is only car use, no lorries etc.  I would love us all to be having nuclear electricity, stop burning gas, oil, petrol etc.  If for nothing more than save that really efficient fuel for aviation, we are so far aware from an electric commercial airliner.

But realistically, we can't flick over to electric without huge upgrades, by using fossils, we don't really have to invest anything.  Hopefully people like Musk will create electric cars that have consumer demand, his goal of starting at the high end, then pushing it down towards more mass market, will make it easier for us to respond with infrastructure to facilitate such things.  However, I for one don't like the idea of having different *power stations* for different brands of car, this is were the government should be pushing hard, make a standardised version of say Teslas Super Charger, that can be used by all manufacturers.

There is going to be consumer demand, get on an economy 7 plan, charge over night, and I worked out a model S would cost me about 2p a mile in leccy...  If you consider the car a £30k 7 year lease (as that is how long the battery is warrentied) then suddenly you've got a very good value proposition.  Tesla hope to have cars in our market at that price in 2 years.

true,[deleted],null,null,"This is not accurate. In the pre-CCTV era of schools, there was a certain expectation of privacy. For example, it would be out of the question to have a teacher standing in the pupils' toilets observing their behaviour, but nowadays many schools have installed CCTV in such spaces that are typically considered private areas.

There was also the expectation that students weren't being continually and robotically monitored at all times. More autonomy was given to the teaching staff in this regard, to build up a pedagogical rapport with students. The classroom was a space in which the teacher and students could interact freely without continual outside monitoring; a group privacy, of sorts. But now many schools have CCTV in every room, undermining that relationship.

My point is that the use of information technology to store simple records of student attainment and attendance is fine. It's a direct upgrade to the filing cabinet and changes nothing about the teacher-student relationship. But this pervasive recording and monitoring of behaviour in every possible area of the school is something new and insidious.

The trouble with ubiquitous CCTV is that there has traditionally been no expectation of being continually monitored by invisible overseers. Imposing this adds an uncomfortable dimension to all of our personal communications. Suddenly you have to watch what you say and what you do, in case someone unseen takes issue with your behaviour.

true,the_ultravixens,null,null,"The problem is that fossil fuels aren't cheap any more.  Oil has been at over $100 a barrel for the last few years, and it's only going to get higher.  Since 2005 the cost of extracting oil has been rising at 10% per year, and it will likely maintain that upward trend as more and more conventional plays dry up, and we have to either drill subsalt, or in very deep water, or frack to get oil.  These methods require much more energy than the old ""drill a hole in a hill and the oil pops out"" type of production, meaning they produce less net energy, and are thus more expensive.

The other issue is that even as the cost of extracting oil rises, we're not producing any more.  Global petroleum production plateaued in 2005, and has remained steady since.  However this has come at massive cost.  2005-2014 $4.5 trillion was invested, and output has stayed level.  In 1995-2005 $1.5 trillion was invested, and global production increased by about 10%.  We presently need to add a new saudi arabia every 5 years simply to maintain production at current levels.  Cheap oil has finished.

This is a problem for many reasons.  The most immediate being that most global industry and agriculture requires easy access to cheap oil in order to continue to function.  We rather need these things to continue functioning, but they rely on incredibly long supply chains and have little redundancy built in.  An oil price shock could do significant damage here.

The next problem is that we rapidly need to transition away from fossil fuels.  Unfortunately doing this requires a large amount of fossil fuels upfront, to build the non-fossil fuel infrastructure as you mentioned earlier.  We no longer have access to cheap, plentiful fossil fuels to enable this transition.

The final issue I have is that the electric car is basically a fucking stupid idea anyway.  1 car per family is an incredibly inefficient way to have a transport system set up, and keeping it working relies on having fossil fuels.  Attempting to sustain such a paradigm with only renewable electricity available is idiocy.  Mass transit electrically powered systems like trams or trolleybuses would represent a vastly superior use of resources.  Elon Musk and tesla represent a ludicrous and unworkable distraction, which attempt to convince us that we only need technology and not to change our behaviour.  Not to mention the utter environmental devastation that mining all the horrible metals that their batteries require would cause.

And finally, nuclear.  I used to work in the industry, and in my mind it has failed.  Fukushima was the nail in the coffin.  I sincerely wish it had been able to deliver on it's promises, but it simply has not.  Global nuclear power production has, in fact, declined since 2000, even as global electricity consumption has skyrocketed.

No money, No good news and lots of hard decisions.    


As for the Lib Dems selling out, yes they have, but who wouldn’t have. First chance in 26 years to get into office, who wouldn’t take it.    
 

 
Tories came into office with no money, they have had to make unpopular cuts and decisions in a time of crisis, remember that. Many of the austerity measures have been controversial and caused upset but they are going to, it is something we have to live with. Others argue we shouldn’t have cut as hard, to them I say, look across the channel at France. Hard decisions in hard times, we do appear to be at least coming out of them now.     



Labour has been lost, no question about it. This argument about the cost of living crisis, is of course not without its truths but we are broke. What did people expect? 2 years austerity then on to Nordic living standards.    
  

No my problem with Labour is that they think the time to restructure the UK’s society and economy is now. It’s like getting out of hospital with both your legs missing and setting off to do a marathon…..

That is totally unacceptable.

By all accounts, many of the players didn't like Mancini, they still played well and did their best for the club.

Nasri, clearly didn't. For 2 years. Two years in which he was one of highest paid professionals at this club, emphasis on professional, he is employed by the club.

Now I can make some allowances, given he's turned it around, but there is evidence, at City, Arsenal, and with the French national team that Nasri has a questionable temperament.

If there is more evidence of this next season season then it could hurt us.

true,SteveCFE,english,England (Living in Wales),"Whether they've done it on purpose or not, that's certainly how people view them. Whenever I tell people I voted Green, they assume I'm out of touch. 

The majority of people do not read manifestos, or policies, or anything. The majority of people watch the news, and whatever they hear on there is what they believe, regardless of factual basis. 'They sure are talking about UKIP a lot, they must be popular, and if they're popular they must be good!' 

Unfortunately the same happens in reverse. 'The Greens? Noone talks about *them,* all I know about them is one of their higher ups got arrested during a protest march. What a bunch of nutters.' 

Any image the media puts forward is totally self perpetuating in that way. The more the media big something up (in this case UKIP) the more people want to hear about it. And the more people want to hear about it, the more the media big it up. It's just another symptom of our shitty media system, with the majority of papers printing ridiculously outlandish titles (Coleslaw? More like CANCERSLAW) to scare, confuse, and confirm imaginary biases (eg-immigrants are benefit tourists!) in order to sell more copies. 

I love the Greens (aside from a few of their anti-science parts, but I always say I'd rather vote for a party I disagree with on one thing than the party I agree with on one thing, plus some of their points about Nuclear Waste disposal are valid concerns) but unfortunately the majority of people don't actually understand them. I'd say the best thing for them would be media coverage, but unfortunately if their current public image is that they are a bunch of hippie nutters then thats what people will want to read, so the cynical side of me says thats all the papers will print, and perpetuate that negative image. 

TL;DR: Newspapers seem do little but scare people and pander to public opinion to sell more papers, which further ingrains that publc opinion into peoples heads, regardless of whether it's true, logical, etc. UKIP is currently in the eye of the storm of that, and the Greens are way off on the sidelines.

What ""prejudice"" are you on about? Do you think the social services called the police because the kid looked ugly or something? They have a duty of care to children and that duty of care involves getting the police involved when it becomes clear a child will be worse off if he stays at his home rather than being removed. 

&gt;were the decisions to do this based on peer reviewed scientific evidence that proved a child being fat was worse than a child being placed into state care

You tell me. The kid stays with his parents, weighs twenty stone by is twentieth birthday, develops diabetes, has to get his foot removed. The NHS are now out of pocket and this kid is minus a foot so now losing weight and exercising is even harder. So he eats more. And his health gets worse. The NHS are losing money again. And he's depressed, so he eats more. Even more health problems erupt so he visits a doctor, costing the NHS even more money. And on and on until he dies at fifty.

Or he gets adopted by a nice family who help him lose weight and exercise and he becomes an Olympic Athelete. Or he gets placed with abusive parents who feed him shit to keep him quiet. 

We have no way of knowing what will happen, the police don't know what will happen, the social services don't know what will happen.

&gt; In movies and TV shows, automated fingerprint analyzers typically overlay various fingerprint images to find a match. In actuality, this isn't a particularly practical way to compare fingerprints. Smudging can make two images of the same print look pretty different, so you're rarely going to get a perfect image overlay. Additionally, using the entire fingerprint image in comparative analysis uses a lot of processing power, and it also makes it easier for somebody to steal the print data.
Instead, most fingerprint scanner systems compare specific features of the fingerprint, generally known as minutiae. Typically, human and computer investigators concentrate on points where ridge lines end or where one ridge splits into two (bifurcations). Collectively, these and other distinctive features are sometimes called typica.

That is politics in a nutshell. The goal is to be elected, not to do good things (though conveniently for the public, those two occasionally are the same).

In cases where something bad is to happen, then best thing for politicians is to A) make sure it doesn't happen when you are in power, and B) blame the opposition. The end result being your party is more likely to be elected.

When people suggest that a benevolent dictator is an ideal way to go, this is why. Said dictator is not consumed by the short-time horizons and need for re-election, and hence would actually solve the problem.

Nonononono. The point of electronical hacking is that it means geographical location is irrelevant. THAT is the ""big deal"" here. This means someone from Indonesia or North Korea can lift your print without moving where the alternative would be logistically difficult (flying to the country and lifting the print).

&gt; Instead, most fingerprint scanner systems compare specific features of the fingerprint, generally known as minutiae.

If we're still scanning the print then its still possible to lift that data from the terminal either through a modified version of the scanning app/driver or another .exe that just knows what addresses in memory to look at.  
That does make it more tricky though (as just compromising the db server is probably easier).

Clearly not, since support for the IRA skyrocketed afterwards, and it had no noted effect on support for the British army from unionists.

&gt;The [City of Melbourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Melbourne)'s flag features a white background divided into four quadrants by a red cross, which is the cross of St. George, the patron saint of England and taken from the English flag. A narrow red bar (known as a cotise) is adjacent to, and parallel with, each side of each arm of the cross. In the centre, a Royal Crown is visible, signifying the [Australian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) city's links to the [British Monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom). Other items featured are, going from top left clockwise, [fleece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wool) hanging from a red ring, a black bull standing on a hillock, a three masted ship in full sail and a spouting whale in the sea. The four [cantons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_(flag\)) represent the main activities of which the economy of the City of Melbourne was based in the mid 19th century. They were wool growing, cattle raising, shipping and whaling.

Its worth pointing out that its _possible_. By all means do the thing, just realise the doors you're opening by doing it.  

&gt; Besides I'm enrolled on the world's first entirely public genome project

difference here is that would be a ""well-known"" biometric if its publicly available. I'm talking about lifting a non-publicly known biometric and making it appear elsewhere.  

If anything my biggest complaint about this process is that it looks like they're using the biometric as username AND password. This is _terrible_ security practice to place into people's minds, the biometric should be username _only_.  
Teach children good security practices please as they will be creating the systems of the future.

Unfortunately, you can't. Just as it quite clear you can't enforce the law and prevention of tyre burning.

The point is that they claim they don't have enough materials yet several areas are building absolutely gigantic bonfires. They should be avoiding tyres and sharing the bonfire materials between them.

Just three examples of the sizes that have been built from ""lack of materials"" in areas that are competing against each other for ""Biggest"" bonfire.

1. He doesn't travel specifically to mess with time. He lives for the experience. He wants to make the universe a better place. He saves worlds he can save, and saves lives he can save. Sometimes time messing does occur, but he doesn't go into a scenario thinking ""ok, how can I cause a paradox here.""  
2. He values a sense of wonder, compassion, selflessness, and adventure in his companions. Being so old, he doesn't always see the universe for the wonderful place it is, so he has the companions to do that for him. He experiences the universe vicariously through them. Every time a companion looks wide-eyed out onto a new planet for the first time, he gets a little taste of that wonder. When a companion is willing to sacrifice their life in the name of doing the right thing, his own ethical principles are renewed and rejuvenated. He places a lot of trust in them. So when a companion doesn't behave how he wants them to, he feels betrayed. He thinks ""I wanted to show you the universe, and all you care about is how you can make the universe benefit you.""

To answer your question, yes, Nasri's counterpart in David Silva. He was his reliable self that season, and could still be relied upon. Albeit I concede that the side overall was below par, I don't think you can use this as a legitimate excuse for Nasri's dreadful showing that season.

No, its mainly understanding the risks involved here.  
One of the first things to appreciate about software and security is there isn't really such a thing as ""better"" or ""worse"" but just trade-offs and these trade-offs aren't always immediately clear.

I take issue with the fact that you're sidelining and dismissing ""neckbeards"" here. I for one work in software and have a very rudimentary understanding of security (i.e. i know that I don't know much), however a lot of ""neckbeards"" are the ones that _actually_ understand this topic, so to just dismiss the people that know the most about the topic matter in the debate strikes me as a very odd thing to do.

I would personally state that the vast majority of the population are genuinely not qualified to discuss these sort of matters with any great weight, much like you wouldn't comment on the engineering of a nuclear reactor or try to advice a doctor performing open heart surgery.  

I appreciate this is a somewhat elitist view but in my experience you need to obtain a certain mindset to able to engineer security in a good way, otherwise the outcome can be really counter productive.",0,1402064513,null,0,false,0,ci0otiv,t3_27gcj9,t1_ci0otiv,t1_ci0oox3,null,1434120139,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,ttamimi,blue,"""Farmer Hat"" Guy","Look mate, lots of developers could be interested if you were a bit clearer on remuniration.

Things like ""Pay dependant on experience"" or ""We're looking for talent"" don't go down well with us (developers/designer).

We often come across this sort of 'opportunity' and more often than not, we end up getting screwed over, either financially or in terms of workload.

Bottom-line advice:

1. Make it more clear what you want the developer for. What do you want them to accomplish. Bullet-point your KPIs so we know what it is we're getting into.

2. Make it more clear what you're willing to pay.

To steer you in the right direction, I'll give you some figures:

Contract rates start at £300 per day for your average, reasonably experienced back-end LAMP developer.

Employee rates start at £23,000 for grads and go up to £35,000 for a middle-weight.

I really wish you all the best in finding a developer, but until you're more clear on what you want, and know EXACTLY what you expect from the developer, you're going to have a poor turn-out, or you're going to end up missing the opportunity to hire the more experienced/talented people.",0,1402064736,null,0,false,0,ci0owu0,t3_27dbx4,t1_ci0owu0,t1_ci0lafx,null,1434120182,2,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,2

In situations like this, always record your phone calls. You don't have to tell them you're doing it and it's perfectly legal to record your calls with anyone for your own records, then should cops or courts get involved you have your own evidence. 

Also, if you haven't recorded your calls, there's a good chance Sky have. You can do a subject access request (they can charge you for this, but it won't be hugely expensive) and request all of your account details and all calls recorded between you and them. Your ex girlfriend can do the same so you get everything sky has. 

I had to do this with HMRC a few years ago and it saved me and the ex wife over two grand because we were able to find the specific call where their operator confirmed our change letter had been received. 

I now record all calls in and out on my mobile, I just delete the personal ones and save all others to my Dropbox.

true,jayman419,amy,Amy,"I knew he'd spoken on it before (but couldn't remember where, to find a link). Thank you for posting that. 

The only difference from explicit canon in my take is how I imagine he feels after he's left them behind. Because he could, any time, nip back to the day after he'd dropped someone off and see them again. He could go to any Christmas dinner, any birthday, any time they'd had a bad day and just needed a hug from a friend... but he doesn't. 

One way to look at it is that he doesn't want to keep interfering in their lives, to let them return to some sense of normalcy without constant reminders of the life they've had to give up. Another way to look at it is that he has all the time in the world to go and visit them so he doesn't have to rush about it, and he's saving those visits for some future time (along his timeline) when he doesn't have to save the universe every week. 

But I don't think either of those is the case. I wouldn't argue very strongly to change someone's mind if that's how they want to look at it, but my personal opinion is that he is very nearly too far gone to care about them once they've left him. I don't think he's intentionally cruel, or that he's using people without giving them anything in return. I think he's just the slightest bit selfish (and as the Doctor says in another scene, [he's not a particularly good man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5JnqPSzSLo)).

On a slightly unrelated note... this scene (and the others from around this time) show how unique Amy was for him, how powerfully she affected him. 

If any other Companion had shown romantic or sexual attraction towards him, it's an immediate ""all stop"" and they're back at home. Yet he tolerates it from Amy, even when she is very blatant and aggressive about it. Instead of leaving her behind, he simply goes and gets Rory for her (and he tolerates it when this doesn't totally resolve the issue, too).",0,1402067021,null,0,false,0,ci0pw87,t3_27g7yd,t1_ci0pw87,t1_ci0phvw,null,1434120647,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,RobinTheBrave,null,null,"&gt; I know the outcomes for a child removed from his parents aren't good.

Generally there's a very good reason why children have been removed from their parents. Years of abuse and neglect do the damage and result in poor outcomes. A baby's brain literally doesn't develop properly if they are treated badly.

Kids who are adopted young generally do pretty well - although they can still have health issues due to substance abuse during pregnancy.

If he's taken into care, it's very unlikely that he'll be in a residential home, those are usually reserved for people who are so difficult that they need more help than a foster family can provide.

From what I've seen, I'm sure social services will have considered (and written reports, discussed in committee and been to court) both sides of the argument. They take take this sort of thing seriously. This won't be the first contact with the parents either. There will have been all sorts of warnings and chances over the last few years.

Most people don't get arrested when their kids are taken into care , so there must have been more to this than is publicly available.

No, the goal of political parties is almost always to do ""good things"" (or rather, things in your interests - good and bad aren't helpful), you just can't do anything without power.

This is why politicians don't just win try and win elections, they also try and place as much power in the hands of as few representatives as possible, so that when they do win an election they can actually control things.
Think of representative democracy as a bunch of wannabe 'benevolent' dictators trying to beat each other.

The way to go is not more representative power but, rather, more participatory power for the electorate. Democracy ensures that the passing of leadership between generations is peaceful, you can't have that with Monarchs or dictators. E.g. when Josip Tito died, Yugoslavia began to fall victim to the old racial power struggles where Tito kept this under control (considering other nations at the time).",0,1402068032,null,0,false,0,ci0qclt,t3_27glji,t1_ci0qclt,t1_ci0nk34,null,1434120860,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I mean if the device that performs the scan is a ""dumb terminal"" that doesn't run any common OS (e.g. embedded linux) that calculates the hash and only pushes that out of the communication channel then that is much, much more difficult to hack.  
ALTHOUGH its still technically possible to somehow phish a poisoned firmware update onto the device. This would actually be a scenario where it would be beneficial if the device has limited enough memory to ONLY run the actual firmware so its really difficult to push out a firmware release that _adds_ poisoned functionality to it (as there wouldn't be enough memory to add the functionality).

Do you have anything to back that up?

&gt; more crucially, it's still too close to the hyper-corrupt and teflon-coated anti-corruption squad, which seems to be drawing ever more powers to itself as a consequence of the 'war on terror'. These guys go to the very top of the police hierarchy, and have always been able to move on before their skeletons are fully exposed to the sunlight.

The anti-corruption squad which also investigates terrorism and awards itself powers? So that's an anti corruption squad, that doesn't just deal with corruption but also terrorism. That must consist of a large number of MPs (to award those powers), police officers from departments like DPS, counter-terrorism command and secret service personnel. If they go to the very top of the police hierarchy then that means the commissioner of the met police, so he's responsible for this anti-corruption squad that's so super secret there is no actual name for it written down public anywhere but which you were able to unearth. I probably wouldn't choose such a public figure to head up such an organisation.

After Tennant, when we got Smith again, I almost gave up on the reboot because it seemed to just be spiraling 'down' (opinion only), with no legitimate reason. So, I would have really appreciated the twist had it come sooner.

that's not going to be too hard. You will ""easily"" be able to get your hands on such a device and reverse engineer it to work out its firmware update protocol.  
But I think you seem to get the picture, nothing is fully secure its just a case of how much effort the attacker needs to put in.  

I guess my biggest worry is the social impact of people being used to scanning their biometrics. If we then flash forward a few years/decades and it becomes more common place and people get lazy and small devices are overpowered and typically run common OSes (i.e. it becomes economically the only sensible option) the potential of the attack increases...... however, hopefully by then our legal system gets to the point of being much more suspicious about fingerprints being used as evidence.

true,Shicchan,lfc99,,"IMO Lallana would be a far superior transfer than any of those three (I haven't watched Markovic at all and not much of Shaqiri, sorry!)

Lallana is a leader (captain of So'ton from 24 y.o), has had success in the Prem, is very keen on joining us and hungry to prove himself in the CL and is very technically skilled. He's also reaching his peak and it's something we need this season to hold onto CL, rather than players with potential who will be world beaters in a few years but won't have as much effect as Lallana right now. He is as much of an engine as Jordan Henderson (covered 1km less). His defensive workrate is fantastic and he would fit in perfectly in Rodgers' system, with his great passing and AMAZING dribbling, not to mention his finishing which will add some much needed goals from midfield. 

For Shaqiri, Whoscored.com (I know, I know... but it's better than nothing!) rates him as having a weak defensive workrate, which obviously isn't ideal. Firmino is actually quite good with his workrate too but I think wouldn't fit in as well as either of Shaq or Lallana in our system. The names you mentioned are all very young, top prospects with massive potential, but I just don't think they'll play better than Lallana this season or next if they were to come. (This is actually against FSG and Rodgers' philosophies of buying young, hungry players with potential who are willing to play their heart out for the club for a long time and will become world class. Players like Cou, Sterling and Sturridge and most definitely Shaq and Firmino.)

Obviously this is all speculation, opinions and really we have no choice in the club's decision (definitely a good thing). Feel free to add your POV on why Shaqiri and Markovic would be better signings than Lallana!

To be fair in addressing your point about poor execution... this was only poorly executed if:
1: The BBC treats regeneration as per your theory.
1b: If the most important part of recasting The Doctor was to adhere to established canon as per your theory. What all interviews seem to say from the people in charge of casting decisions is that they simply cast the best actor for the Doctor that they can choose, with Moffat saying himself a woman or black person for instance could take the role if they fit best. I do agree though that the Doctor has retained a very British White Male feeling, and to change a character to promote diversity is just as bad as whitewashing in situations where a character could be more effective as a different culture/heritage/color.

Just quickly glancing through the games from March on, Nasri got one of the assists in the win over United, got both of the assists versus West Ham, scored our loan goal vs Spurs, scored versus Chelsea, got an assist versus Newcastle, got an assist versus Barnsley. He was one of the stand-out players on the team during this period.

In 13/14, he was quite clearly one of our best players and most importantly, he remained healthy for most of the season. As good as David was, and he was absurdly good, his ankle may always be an issue and we need someone like Nasri who can take the reins while he is out.

You questioned the signing of a new long-term deal because he can be inconsistent, but that's largely irrelevant. If we didn't sign him to a new deal, then he would have no value if we do try to sell him in the future.

true,hairlesscaveman,null,null,"IANAL, but from what I understand about contracts is that it's an agreement between 2 parties. They should not be able to alter the terms of the contract without your agreement. If they took over the contract from your previous employer *and you didn't sign anything new* then those are still the terms of the contract, they simply agreed to take the place of the other party and honour the agreement as is. If you signed something new, then check the document - you may have agreed to their terms without noticing.

However, I reasonably sure (but do check) UK law states that in your first year the max notice you have to give is 1 month, anything different in your contract cannot be upheld until that point. If you *did* sign something new then it could be seen as a new contract of employment, and therefore a new job with a new start date. Could be an easier way out if you just want to go.

I've been in a similar situation where I had a 3-month notice period but had an offer on the table. I simply handed my notice in with a letter stating my last day of employment; stating a specific date, not just ""in 1 month"". It was accepted without comment. 

It really all boils down to frank conversations with the various parties involved. Firstly with your current employer stating that you're not happy and you're looking to leave ASAP, secondly with any potential employers that you're a little stuck with your current notice period but you'd be happy to maybe use the time to get up to speed with things at the new place so you can hit the ground running when you start.

If you go across leagues it doesn't make sense because the competition differs (meaning, your score will be inflated in poor leagues and your score will be artifically low against top competition). 

Within the Premier League, Hazard is 5th. Within La Liga Bale is 3rd. Within Ligue 1 Zlatan is 1st. Seems pretty accurate to me.

I am really using Whoscored, it's one of the best quantitative tools we have available. It provides evidence over 1000's of minutes in a season and many different attributes of play. It's far more reliable than the fact that Barcelona fans don't like Fabregas. The reason they don't like him is he doesn't fit their play style, not that he is poor in any way. 

The reasons Barcelona don't like him are: 

-He likes to move forward and make somewhat riskier passes than Barcelona's style is suited for.

-He plays in the same positions as Messi/Xavi/Iniesta, CM or False 9. People prefer the team legends to Fabregas.

-He doesn't have the positional discipline that Xavi has.

The first two aren't even problems for Chelsea, they are advantages (we need a CM). The positioning thing is an issue, but do you honestly believe that Mourinho won't be able to teach an extremely talented 27 year old how to play in his system the way he wants? I have faith in Mourinho - he's turned Willian, Oscar and Schurrle into some of the most defensively effective AM's in the world and the only thing stopping Fabregas from seeing the same improvement is if his attitude keeps him from listening.

If Poch lines up with his 4-2-3-1 I would LOVE to see Eriksen, Holtby, Lamela and a CM pairing of a destroyer (either Sandro/Capoue) and a player like Dembele/Paulinho/Bentaleb behind them. I would love Holtby to play the Kagawa role in Klopps Dortmund and at Utd ''occasionally'' and think he's absolutely perfect for it. Kagawa would press, press, press and put the backline under pressure all game, and in Utds game v Leverkusen one of their goals came directly from Kagawa pressing the backline, winning the ball and playing Giggs in which in turn led to goal. There's lots of examples of this @ Dortmund. 

Obviously Lewis would have to pace himself like you said, he has a tendency to get burnt out because he closes down everything but I think in more of an advanced role with a CM pairing behind him he would be fine.

We should look to sign someone in the range of 1-3mill.  Dunne is still useful and can act as a cover.  We might want to loan a younger defender in the case of unforeseen injuries.

Midfield PL calibre players goes like this: Barton, Hoilett, Phillips, Traore and Faurlin if he can reach his old form.  Players like O'Neil and Henry could play a part but I just don't see enough skill between the two of them.  We should look to sign a central midfield, as controlling the ball in the midfield is going to be key in the PL.  We should also look to loan a player in midfield.

PL-calibre strikers include Austin.  Doyle could play a part but this is an area where we really lack.  Spend upwards of 6mill on a big, strong striker who can score goals.

As far as the rest of the team goes, drop the old players we loaned out, get rid of the slack and start building from the core that got us into the Premiership.  The positions that need the most help are defender and striker.
