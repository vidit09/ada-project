true,too_oh_ate,null,null,"Gareth Bale is not a Spurs legend, but he may be the best player to ever play for us.

As the article states, the word legend is way overused today. Think about what the word is actually meant to convey, and how rare and unprecedented of a talent it must be. Yet people are saying the following from only three years ago are potentially legends: Bale, King, Lennon, Dawson, Modric, Defoe. That list isn't legends, its our recent stars.

In my opinion to be a legend for a soccer club you must tick off all of the following, and in parenthesis my assessment with Bale:
- amazing talent significantly better than the league (yes)
- create unforgettable moments that will always be spoken of (yes)
- become someone synonymous with the club (no)
- give your all for the club (yes) until you can give no more (no), realizing you are a part of something bigger and more important than you (no)

King ticks off all of those, and is a legend. Bale is one of the world's best who gave us moments we'll never forget, but ultimately isn't one in the same with Spurs and left when he still had plenty in the tank for his own personal preference.

Sorry non-Americans:
I can't believe I'm doing this since I hate the Yankees more than anything, but this is a really good comparison. Both these guys give their all for their club, have played for their team for way more than six years (like Bale), have provided huge moments in the teams history and are both considered among the best in their position. Who is a shoe in for legend and who would never, ever be considered as one?

He isn't under house arrest. He can leave any time he likes, it just so happens he'll be arrested and deported if he does.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I think this exact reason is what makes them an interesting prospect as owners.

These guys are cut from the same cloth as Levy/Lewis, they will have looked at Spurs and seen the potential to be a massive investment opportunity.

I've said it before, the club is set up to be a wet dream for someone looking to get into the PL. We literally check all the boxes for a new potential owner to drool over the possibility of owning the club. The difficult parts of owning the club are all settled (new stadium planned and agreed upon, new training facility already built, squad already competing at the top of the table, marketing inroads laid in APAC/NAM etc)....the last difficult part would be financing the stadium build and these guys have enough financial backing for it not to be an issue. Beyond stadium financing really it is up to the club to decide on investment on the squad and investment in foreign markets.

I could see the actually day to to day running of the club remaining very, very similar to how it is currently being run. But, these guys are the types that if they legitimately felt that a specific cash infusion would result in a significant return they very well could make that investment.

These guys have just mind boggling amounts of money.

Chris Rock put it as this:
&gt;""Shaq is rich,"" he said, referring to the Los Angeles Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal, ""but the white man who signs his check is wealthy. Oprah is rich, but Bill Gates is wealthy. If Bill Gates suddenly woke up with Oprah's money, he'd slit his throat.""

they aren't ""rich""...these guys are WEALTHY.  If they feel the investment could benefit from spending a bit more money they certainly are capable of doing so without batting an eye. 

Even if they didn't feel that there would be an immediate benefit to investing a large sum of cash i wouldn't see them straying from the path that ENIC have laid out......in terms of people linked to potentially buying us out, this is right up there as one of the most appealing possible.",0,1410541161,null,0,false,0,ckgewdl,t3_2g7njl,t1_ckgewdl,t3_2g7njl,null,1427049502,9,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,9

&gt;Unsettled in Italy, Henry transferred from Juventus on 3 August 1999 to [Arsenal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.) for an estimated fee of £11 million, reuniting with his former manager Arsène Wenger.   It was at Arsenal that Henry made his name as a world-class footballer,  and although his transfer was not without controversy, Wenger was convinced he was worth the transfer fee.  Brought in as a replacement for fellow French forward [Nicolas Anelka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Anelka), Henry was immediately moulded into a striker by Wenger, a move that would pay rich dividends in years to come. However, doubts were raised about his ability to adapt to the quick and physical English game when he failed to score in his first eight games.  After several difficult months in England, Henry even conceded that he had to ""be re-taught everything about the art of striking.""  These doubts were dispelled when he ended [his first season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999%E2%80%932000_Arsenal_F.C._season) at Arsenal with an impressive goal tally of 26.  Arsenal finished second in the [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999%E2%80%932000_FA_Premier_League) behind [Manchester United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.), and lost in the [UEFA Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999%E2%80%932000_UEFA_Cup) [Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_UEFA_Cup_Final) against [Turkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey) side [Galatasaray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galatasaray_S.K._(football_team\)).

true,HiSpain,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"&gt; Nope. The Scottish Governments forecasts for an independent Scotland only include Corporation Tax they'd pay due to their activity in Scotland, which is the same regardless of where they are based. And most of these banks (including RBS) are already heavily based in the City anyway.

Sure okay, tax havens exist for no reason whatsoever.

&gt;Nope again. The only RBS jobs that may leave are from their HQ which has already been cut drastically and may still move south even in the event of a No vote, there have been rumblings about this for a long time. Did you even listen to the Chief Executive, he said there was ""no intention to move operations or jobs.""

No one in the world of banking expects there to be anything left in Scotland of RBS except high street banks within five years of a yes vote. The UK electorate won't stand for it, things will be slowly but surely moved down south, consolidating around the city.

I genuinely don't understand why you think that letter was has any credibility at all. There seems to be a schizophrenia about bankers in the independence movement. On the one hand they're all bastards you can't wait to be shot of who can't be trusted on anything, on the other this CEO is definitely telling the truth in this non legally binding platitude he's sent out to his own workers.

true,castlecraver,logo,,"&gt; whatever English supporters want to say about us Americans doesn't matter

It absolutely does matter, but it shouldn't affect the enjoyment you get out of being a supporter. If you're respectful of the tradition and culture and don't go around trying to make yourself out as something you're really not, no one worth listening to is going to not like you. I sympathize with some of the past comments here reflecting frustration when the Club seems to be catering to new, overseas fans perhaps at the expense of the locals, but I also think it's unreasonable to expect to be one of the biggest teams in the world without a fanbase that includes us. And indeed, I'll surely never fully appreciate any of it on the same level of someone who's a born-blue ""through and through"" from Manchester, but I enjoy it, get a lot out of engaging with other fans in person and helping run my local supporters' club, and never really felt the need to justify myself to anyone. I feel like if one's support can be shaken by a little skepticism of his motives, maybe he *is* in it for the wrong reasons.

Don't feel threatened by it, just realize you've got to be respectful and aware that City means a lot more to most supporters than the 11 guys that suit up on Saturday and trying to earn 3 points. Most of us foreign fans really have no claim to that deeper level of support. Learn as much as you can about City and Manchester and you'll see that there's an incredibly rich history and so much to admire about the support and community that's built this Club. That'll enrich your experience immensely; also if you have a local MCFC supporters' club definitely join up and build some camaraderie. We've practically had our own little lending library going at times in the DC group and I've been able to swap books and DVDs that are sometimes hard to find in the US.

Also be sure to follow your local team as well, so that you can feel a little more ownership and connection to a team you support. My old hometown just started a new club this year (not MLS) and even though the culture around it isn't even a tiny shadow of football culture in Europe and that we've managed to bastardize certain aspects of the competition in our distinctly American way, that's my local club and it's really super exciting to see the support building.",0,1410542558,null,0,false,0,ckgfn1g,t3_2g46bo,t1_ckgfn1g,t1_ckge7ua,null,1427049109,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2

He actually answered this one emphatically with reference to both corporation tax law, and an email from the CEO itself.

The second question he asked was ""why should we trust you rather than the CEOs of these companies"". In terms of the second question, he gave  several counter points

* These warnings about companies and money leaving scotland, there's nothing new here, this was announced months ago. The HQ of a business is essentially a plaque on the wall. 

* Lloyds may have registered its HQ in Edinburgh, but its principal offices are in London, and that's been the case for a long time (years). Salmond commented that there are zero jobs associated with the registered office in Edinburgh.

* He then underpinned the question of trust with a screenshot from the BBC's own website, indicating that the treasury had briefed the BBC with market sensitive information **ahead of the bank's official announcement**, and that the BBC had published this information.  
Salmond accurately points out that the sharing of this information by The Treasury (and the BBC) is of the highest seriousness, as this is essentially mass Insider Trading.

The second question really should be ""You answered the first question, why should be believe your answer?"" 

That's a very irritating question. Trust of someone is an opinionated thing. By asking that he's implying he (and thus the BBC for whom he is speaking by asking these questions) doesn't trust Salmond. Salmond here is dealing in facts of law, and with quotes from other people, those are things I can take on faith from a politician until someone says ""actually I never said that"" or ""actually the law doesn't say that, I'm a lawyer/judge"".

I don't trust the opinions of politicians, I turn a deaf ear whenever Salmond talks about ideals and all that jazz. I listen when he speaks in terms of numbers, in terms of law, in terms of quantifiable benefits to the people of Scotland. 

I remain unconvinced by any of them, but I am certainly angry at any one of them being misrepresented by an allegedly impartial source like the BBC.

**TL:DR;** He answered the first question succinctly.  
He only partially answered the second question, but it's a stupid question that boils down to ""but why should we trust you"". If he hadn't stood up to the scrutiny of public attention, he'd never have gotten into Holyrood twice, this time with a *Majority* Government.

true,zweep,cnty-scotland,A traitor separatist.,"&gt;They knew, instinctively, that these concentric rings of identity were complementary, not opposed.

I disagree, people keep saying this about how even though we're different nations we're still a union. People up here identify themselves as mostly Scottish, they see their Scottish country and they see the English in England. I'ts not a negative thing, they just don't see themselves as cut from the same cloth. I think you see that culturally, socially and politically. There are people who the use the argument we have been a union for 300 years and are partners, but then these same people are quick to say that we owe them after all it was England that bailed out Scotland to begin with, it was England that done Scotland the solid and allowed it join. So was it Scotland that done the UK a solid by allowing it sell off and have nothing to show for all the oil? Was it Scotland that done England a solid by holding all the nuclear weapons? ""No because we are a union and those things are shared"" Horse shit - we are separate countries and in we are all aware of it, it's not a bad thing or a good thing, it is what it is - but people love to pick and choose when they want to make the case of us being a union.

If you talk about 'those crazy Scots north of the border' it is quite literally that, a different country separated by a border.

&gt;Britain would also be more likely to leave the European Union, since Scots are better disposed to Europe than are the English (and are less likely to vote for the Conservatives, who are promising a Euro-referendum if they win next year’s general election).

This really grinds my fucking gears when people spout this shite as well. Are you actually trying to suggest that Scotland or the Scots owe it to fight the political battle of the English? A country ten times bigger? 

How about instead of crying we'll lose the left vote, the English start voting left? There is an absolutely wonderful political rejuvenation going on up here. People are packing town halls and community centres every night discussing politics and figuring out what and where we want to go as a nation - instead it's being told you need to forgo independence and a dream of a better society to help balance the south, to fight the battles for a nation of 50 million as a nation of 5. That's warped logic and unfair in my opinion.

Without trying to generalize and I by no means everyone because that's dumb, there are **a lot** of English people in this subreddit who rather than seeing the reform taking place up here and saying how can we emulate it and copy it and spread that same excitement and hunger for change, are saying shut up and just stay with us because change isn't easy.

There is a lot to lose in this referendum, I would never deny that, I won't deny it's also a risk but I don't need to see a richer Scotland to vote yes, I don't need milk and honey to piss from the skies to feel justified in splitting up a 300 year old union. This is about so much more than that now and a lot of people aren't seeing it because of some seriously flawed media reporting. If your anywhere else in the UK and watching the BBC you might think we are all zombies praising the wisdom of Alex Salmond and his vision but we aren't. We are excited, enticed and enthralled at the prospect of creating our country a-new, creating it with laws and a system we want and indeed we deserve. Now that's not to say anyone else in the UK doesn't deserve it either, but I don't see the political campaigning to achieve it anywhere else.

If the yes vote wins on Thursday and in a decades time we look back and see that although Scotland was stable it was economically worse off I will consider that a success - because we re-built and reformed a system that for people up and down this union feels does not represent them or their family.

**PROS**

* The round face is sartorially preferable

* The more you use Google Now, the more you'll like it

* Battery life hasn't been an issue after the first day (you play with it a lot). It lasts a full day.
* Not having to pull out your phone to see meeting requests, texts, notifications is awesome

**CONS**

* If you listen to podcasts/music, the card to control the player is constantly on, which sucks for the commute

* It does impact your phone's battery life in a noticeable, but not significant way

true,canada432,null,null,"I'm American but I live abroad and have done a lot of traveling, and from my experience it's not the English speaking country problem, but rather an issue of a homogenous community with no exposure to other speech. The only people who have a problem understanding other accents are people who live in an area with 1 language and 1 accent and don't travel so they aren't exposed to anything else. I've noticed the same thing with other languages in other countries. For example I live in south Korea, and I've seen Seoul Koreans who can't understand a word spoken by a korean from busan. Yet myself and my terrible Korean had no problem at all. I have no problems with any English accent, even the worst Chinese accent with the most broken English is fine for me. Yet people I grew up with (rural Missouri) can't even comprehend a London accent, or an Irish accent. 

My theory is its the way the brain recognizes speech. If you only ever hear one thing then your brain registers that ad what speech sounds like, so hearing something different is difficult to recognize. Meanwhile if you're multilingual or exposed to a variety of speech, your brain can process different sounding speech better because it doesn't have as strict a preconceived notion if what speech is required to sound like.

There's some great jobs boards and resources out there that are student and graduate specific. I was a bit clueless as to where to look at first, so in case you're not aware of them, here's a few:

- Enternships: http://www.enternships.com/
- Go Think Big: http://www.gothinkbig.co.uk/

I would also recommend seeing if your University careers service (or a local careers service, if you've moved back home) runs a graduate job/internship service that might be another place to look.

A-Rod was a top draft pick, was a starting SS at 19, constantly just chased $$$ throughout his career, and never stayed with one team, other than the Yankees, more than 6 years (Bale's time with Spurs). He will never be a Yankee's legend, just as Bale will never be a legend to Real Madrid.  Bale was a young player with a high ceiling who played a position where quality is hard to come by. He was benched for almost all of 08 and 09. Nobody thought he would be a world beater.
  
Bale didn't run away from Southampton or Spurs for a paycheck. He left for an opportunity, at first for Premier League football, and secondly to win a Champions League title and silverware. He tried to drag an overachieving Spurs squad in 2010, 2011, and 2012 to this, and almost succeeded.  
  
My point is this: Gareth Bale will always be a Spurs legend, regardless of his time at the club. He made a decision to move to a club where he didn't have to single handedly win every game in order to accomplish what he and so many others would like to accomplish in their careers. He stayed as long as he could and gave the club everything he had.

It fell but I refused to let it go, pulled what felt like every muscle in my right arm and picked it back up. I'd just met my mates for a days riding and had to go home barely able to ride.

Set off from another pub car park, after talking to a mate at the bike for a bit Id forgot all about the disc lock. Fell over to the right, trapped my leg, mashed a car with my helmet and was sandwiched between the car and my bike. With the disc lock alarm screaming :) Luckily it fell on my boot and neither I or the bike suffered any damage. - Mid summer, crowds outside the pub. Felt like a bollock for weeks. 

In the lake district on a nice flat road in lovely weather not far away from Kendal I went for a nice open easy overtake. I'd probably had around 3 weeks experience at this point on my 750 so naturally i'd prepared by dropping it down a few cogs, I pulled out to overtake and it wheelied, I saw sky, my legs jumped off the pegs and my eyeballs jumped out of their sockets. I was overtaken about 2 minutes later by the same car as I had to pull over and check my pants.

All were experiences that have taught me alot. So you just need to go over it and pick out what you did wrong :). 

I had poor clutch and throttle control , as it had never seemed important on a 125 pissing about nailing through the gears. But a heavy bike taught me the throttle is the key. Then I learned I had to pay more attention when setting off, not just for a disc lock but a quick glance at tyres/road surface etc makes me feel much better when setting off. Then finally the last one, that one taught me what i've learned the most from - never ride at 100% or you're gambling.

He will never become a Ramires type player who will chase down every ball and run rampant up and down the field. He is an attacking player who could potentially be a Balon D'or finalist. You need to let him be free and do what he does best. If we chain him down and try and turn him into a ""Mourinho winger"" he could turn into a Joe Cole type player.

In the future he will probably be competing with Neymar, Mario Goetze and others for the Balon D'or. If he is hindered by playing as a more defensive player instead of having freedom to attack like the others he will have a very hard time keeping up with them.

As would I, but it's head over heart for me.

&gt; you've concluded it'll be worth it long term?

Absolutely.

&gt; What are your views on joining the EU and adopting the Euro?

As an independent member of the EU, Scotland would double its representation with 12 or 13 MEPs (there are currently only 6). I think this is a great opportunity. I also don't think it's in anyone's interest to stop Scotland being a continuing member of the EU. I have no strong feelings towards the Euro, although I would personally prefer Scotland to have its own currency pegged to the Pound or the Euro (like the Danish krone is) than for it to join any sort of currency union.

true,harry_h00d,flair8,,"I vote yes. The main argument against the ""legend"" status was his departure to Real and the way he ""went about it"". To quote the article:  
  
1. Spurs £104m spending spree in the months before his transfer suggest the deal with Madrid was agreed a long time before it was made official.  
2. He was almost certainly not being used in pre-season friendlies to avoid him getting injured, rather than him refusing to play.  
3. To this day there have been no direct quotes or reliable news reports that prove his conduct was anything but professional at the time. In fact, Daniel Levy, who doesn’t suffer fools gladly and is not afraid to go public with it, closed his official club statement at the time with the words “We wish Gareth all the best in the future and he shall always be welcome at the Lane” – hardly the remarks of someone who has been disrespected.  
4. He just doesn’t seem that sort of guy (personal opinion)  
  
What will always stand out to me is not his immense talent, but his ability to single-handedly take Spurs to places that nobody thought we would go. In 2010, he is some dashing Welsh teenager absolutely roasting the likes of Maicon, Micah Richards, and Co. After the inital media buzz around this new Suprs starlet, he only continued to improve, even when the team aged and deteriorated around him. VdV left, Defoe got old, Luka left, Scotty Parker aged out (god bless you Scott Parker), Harry got fired.......these are all things that would have upset the form of any emerging player.  None of these things fazed Gareth. If anything, they motivated him to rise up and become THE ultimate decider on the success of the club. Hell, he almost did it in 2012 all by himself, and all while the big clubs were circling like vultures. 
  
The man left to achieve a CL trophy, and now he has one. He (probably) will never play in a World Cup, surely never win a World Cup, and this makes the CL his Mount Olympus. He gave everything humanly possible in his quest to achieve this at Spurs, but football has 11 a side, not 1.

Second, try and analyze Hazard's performances on the pitch. The main problem he's been dealing with since he came is that whenever he receives the ball, he gets marked instantly by 2 or 3 defenders at the same time, denying him the space he needs to create and score goals. Having genuinely dangerous players in the team like Costa, Fabregas, and Schuerrle - who want to take responsibility for scoring rather than tapping the ball around the top of the box - will occupy the attention of defenders. Rather than stunting Hazard, this should set the stage for him to become even more dangerous. No longer will he run into brick walls. Furthermore, the 90+ chances that he creates in a season won't be wasted on the likes of Torres, Eto'o, and Ba. Playing the same as last season, even without improving at all, putting a decent striker in the box for him to feed will make him look a lot better.

true,lawlore,null,null,"I was a sixth form student at the time (I was 17), and the attacks happened about 1pm GMT, when I was at school. However, I found out about them about three hours later, when someone mentioned them at my after school job- the school didn't tell us anything. To be brutally honest, my reaction was about the same as it would be to any tragedy in a far off place- the Tsunami is a good parallel: sad for those it affected, but not personally touched by it. The only people I knew in America were well over on the other coast. For comparison, I went numb and wept like a baby- as a lot of the nation did- at Princess Diana's death. I still can't listen to the 1997 version of ""Candle In The Wind"" without welling up.

However, in terms of the reaction to it- well, of course there was a lot of sympathy. At the same time a lot of people became very, very angry at PM Tony Blair's unwavering following of George W's course of action, and the two of them leading us into an illegal war. This came from the sense that the subsequent invasion of Iraq was both unjustified by the facts available- [""Fahrenheit 9/11"" did very well over here](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3887075.stm)- and would make the UK a target for retaliation. Blair representing the UK and showing brotherly support for the US is one thing, but joining them in a war that the public didn't support was quite another- [especially as more and more British soldiers died](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair#Events_before_resignation). Although he did win another election in 2005, that was more due to feeble opposition from Michael Howard's Conservatives, and it ultimately defined his tenure as PM.

In terms of day-to-day post 9/11, I concur with others saying that no good has come of it, and that most of it derives from Bush and Blair responded to it. The 7/7 bombings are probably the most obvious example- just looking at [this list of terrorist attacks in the UK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents_in_Great_Britain) shows just how much incident there'd been with Islamic extremists before 9/11: none. Even at the time, the situation with the Real IRA was at a relatively quiet point compared with previous periods- Clinton and Blair had made good diplomatic progress in that area.

On a day-to-day basis, things that are done in the name of ""preventing terrorism"" are generally seen as over-the-top reactions. Flying is a particular bugbear. Racial tensions within the country, particularly Islamophobia, appear to be flaring up again, and the fact that a party like UKIP can win a European Election despite having no manifesto and being filled with bigots and racists is troubling. Of course, it's unfair and wildly inaccurate to pin all of this on 9/11, but at the same time, the knock-on events it led to will undoubtedly have had some influence on current opinions and attitudes.

In terms of 9/11 itself now? If I hadn't checked the news first thing in the morning the other day, I wouldn't have realised that day was any more noteworthy than September 10th.

I don't think how they started is that relevant here - I'm talking about where they are now (Yankees, Madrid) versus where they were before that (Texas, Spurs), and what it meant to each of those ""before"" teams.

But that being said, lets look at all the similarities:
1. # of teams they've played for: A-Rod went from Seattle to Texas to New York. Bale went from Southampton to Tottenham to Madrid. 

2. Money: Both A-Rod and Bale left their 2nd team to their 3rd team for the most amount of money ever in their respective sport. 

3. Previous team performance: Both A-Rod and Bale single handedly carried Texas and Spurs, earning MVP awards in the process, but never achieving the ultimate prize.

4. Salary and Motivation: Both said they left for reasons tied to dreams of playing for childhood favorites, and to win. Very fortunate for them, both also received salaries that put them as among the top earners in their sport, so motivation is suspect here. Both got to win trophies once they left, but they also both received massive amounts of money in the process. 

5. Length of time at team: ""He stayed as long as he could"". What does this mean? A player can stay as long as they want anywhere when they are of the talent level A-Rod and Bale are. They each left their team because they wanted something better for themselves, independent of the team they were leaving. Each could have stayed as long as they needed to at their previous team and help build it up (someone like Verlander comes to mind - another team I hate, damn!), or they could take the easy way out and go play for mega clubs. 


For me at least, being a legend means doing something special and at great risk to yourself (e.g. being the person to knowingly put the weight of games on your shoulders every single week - that is basically a legend defined to me). Something extraordinary (read: not going to the mega club that will pay you barrels of money.) Bale is a world-class player and will be a success wherever he plays. Going to Madrid is the simple thing that he could and did do, to win trophies, and make a shit ton of money. There is zero risk there, and its not something that I applaud. A legendary move to me is saying no, I want to make less (but still more than I'll ever need) money at a smaller club, help build it up, attract more talent and even though I may win less, those victories mean 10x as much as they will at a place like Madrid, to both me and the team I play for. 

TL;DR:

The Game Is About Glory, but to me there is no glory in winning the CL when you have a team with the salary of Madrid. True glory is David beating Goliath - that echoes forever and are the stories and heroes we remember. Tottenham would have never forgotten Bale if he stayed, regardless of if we never won it all. As it stands now there is clearly debate about his legacy. Conversely, Madrid will forget Bale within five years of him leaving, regardless if they win two or three more CL trophies.",0,1410549753,null,0,false,0,ckgjg1p,t3_2g7gr3,t1_ckgjg1p,t1_ckgibls,null,1427046742,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

If you read into those stories, what the BBC is telling you is bullshit.

John Lewis said prices could change, as they could in any economy, watch the video, its on youtube. Standard Life announced months ago that they were moving regardless of independence. Of course oil will run out, its a finite resource, but BP, nor anyone else can claim to know how much oil is there precisely.

Not to mention, the PM has been begging every big business he can get in contact with to make declarations about negative aspects of independence, whereas the companies supporting independence are being largely ignored.

English nationalism would be in opposition to a union of nations that is rarely powerful enough to cause some large scale change to England without the input of England itself. Therefore it is almost an irrelevant goal to strive toward.

Myself and most other English people would probably consider English independence from the UK to be a dishonorable action to take, as it could leave the other constituent countries with some real problems that they would struggle to overcome without the help of a larger power like England. Although Scotland leaving the UK causes problems, there isn't any doubt that the rest of us would be able to survive just fine. 

One of the biggest issues in England (as it has always been and still remains to this day) is immigration. I would say that Westminster definitely does not reflect the feeling of the majority of the English population on this issue, therefore most English nationalist groups are going to have this at the forefront of their concerns. Scotland does not have an immigration problem, but if it did and the SNP were seeking independence to remedy this, they would most likely be under the exact same type of scrutiny that English parties like the English Democrats are regularly under.

In regards to what you say about the English flag, I fail to see how it is associated with racism and hatred. If you drive around the countryside in the south of England you will notice that the St George's cross is everywhere.

It's not been driven by facts or logic, but anti-English racism.

Do you remember a lot of times people were talking about Hazard disappearing in matches last season? That is what happens when you are mixed up continuously transitioning from defense to attack and can't get enough of the ball in the final third. I don't know if you can remember Hazard's first season with us in the first few games, but he was given much more freedom than he was been getting now, and he was electrifying. He was starting counter attacks, run through defenses and just much more of a live wire in attack. You can see in the past season he was much more reserved, but a talent as big as him is impossible to stop so he obviously continued to grow, but I think he could have been even better.

For example, this was one of his first games in the 12/13 season. Look at his positioning for the opening goal @ 0:31. Its a transition from deep defense to attack, typical counter attack. You can see he is already up the field, in the attack position. The way he is playing now he never would be in such a position. This entire goal was started from him, in an ironically Mourinho-like counter attack.

http://youtu.be/qagV5VLuZ3U?t=24s

The difference in Hazard's overall play is huge between the last two seasons. He was overall much better in the 12/13 season and played with much more of an influence. In 13/14 season, he obviously got a lot of experience and got better after his first year but he was confined to only certain magical moments instead of constantly being a livewire and running rampant like in his first season.",0,1410550579,null,0,false,0,ckgjw7g,t3_2g83jf,t1_ckgjw7g,t1_ckgjicm,null,1427046424,-1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,-1

The ""English"" are seen as the main colonisers, the invaders and powers of Britain.

Also it is the English who 'conquered' the rest of Britain (except Scotland) so they do seem like the aggressors. 

Similarly, when foreigners think British they more or less think the average Englishmen, not actually distinguishing the difference between Welsh, Irish, Scottish and English.

true,cathartis,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt; Because of poor finance regulations. Nothing to do with open 
primaries.

Who creates the campaign finance reputations - politicians elected in primaries. They are part of the same system. Primaries allow election results to be affected by spending money advertising to a much smaller portion of the electorate than in the election itself.

When $16.2 million was spent in the recent republican primary for Arizona governor, do you think the candidates were wasting their money?

&gt; You mean like how Barack Obama and Bill Clinton were selected, the famous left-wing crazies? The Republicans pick hardcore candidates because American conservatives tend to be very right wing. They are merely reflecting the views of the electorate. It's not primaries that are responsible.

Your error is in thinking that there is somehow some sort of left-wing of the Democrat party that an extreme candidate could appeal to. There isn't. Or at least not of any substantial size. It is a right-wing party, simply less right wing than the republicans. When Obama was elected, he was the more extreme, less orthodox candidate (compared to Hillary Clinton).

Sometimes parties pick the candidate most likely to beat the opposition, and that's the reason many candidates are chosen in the UK, including every Prime Minister we have had since Major. However at other times parties chose the candidates who are most ideologically extreme.  My point is that primaries make the second outcome more likely.

Tea party candidates are actually completely sh*t at open elections involving all voters. In any close seat they lose. However when standing in a safe republican seat, wining the actual election is a non-issue. They don't need to appeal to centerists at all. All they need to do is appeal to the republican core, and that's where tea-partiers get in. They are good at winning republican primaries. So many end up being elected even though they are lousy at appealing to the electorate.

If we adopted a similar system, I'd expect to see a big increase in candidates who are great at preaching to the converted whilst offering nothing to the general population.",0,1410551147,null,0,1410551518,0,ckgk7e4,t3_2g6iag,t1_ckgk7e4,t1_ckgie3u,null,1427046233,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;The film was released in Japan on March 11, 1984. While created before [Studio Ghibli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli) was founded, the film is considered to be the beginning of the studio and is often included as part of the Studio's works, including the *Studio Ghibli Collection* DVDs and [Blu-rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray).

It actually is relevant. One of the major plot points of the War Doctor reveal in *Name of the Doctor* is that ""Doctor"" wasn't just a title, it was a code of conduct - as long as he went by ""Doctor"" he had to abide by that code. 

In *Night of the Doctor* when 8 is given the choice of who to regenerate into he asks for a version of himself that will be a warrior, someone who won't live by the code of conduct that goes along with calling himself ""Doctor"". 

So yes, the War Doctor was an incarnation of the Time Lord who usually goes by ""Doctor"", but he wasn't ""The Doctor"".

I find that this particular sub is more courteous and features better reddiquette than most other subs I've seen.  It's part of why I like it here.  I also think that this has deteriorated a bit recently, so PSAs/discussions about it are perfectly apropos.

I wrote this about a year ago:

&gt; I generally upvote posts (even ones whose opinions I don't share) that:

&gt; * make an eloquent contribution that fosters good discussion
* make especially rigorous arguments
* go above and beyond to answer a question in extra depth
* show particular decency, kindness, or helpfulness

&gt; I generally downvote posts (even ones whose opinions I share) that:

&gt; * are irrelevant or distracting
* are antagonistic or prejudicial
* display serious arrogance or dismissiveness of others' ideas
* are in poor taste

&gt; For example, I'll upvote a comment that explains in depth why Zeki Fryers plays better at CB than LB (extra depth, fosters discussion). 

&gt; I'll downvote a post that unironically corrects ""colour"" to ""color"" or the reverse (prejudicial, culturally belittling/antagonistic).            

I do think it is important to try and maintain standards.  Yes, there will be occasional miscreants and visiting scum/chavs/douchebags, but if the rest of us retain our ethics, the sub will still be better for it, and better than most other places.

Capoue - Stambouli

Ladmela - Eriksen - Chadli 

Kane


I think everyone line ups will probably look like this.


Sunderland doesn't scare me, but the Black Cats can't be underestimated. Year after year avoiding relegation, that's impressive.

In my opinion, 99% of players in any sport all have the individual goal to be on a championship-winning team sometime in their playing career. To quote the article:  
&gt; In the end, every player moves on sooner or later. This is inevitable. Jennings joined Arsenal. Hoddle and Waddle moved abroad for European football. Gazza left for Lazio. Teddy went to Man Utd in search of trophies. I don’t think any Spurs fan would question these players status as club legends.   
  
In very few cases (Ledley King) does a player stay with one club and remain blinded by the temptation of moving to a ManU, Real, Barca, etc. It is commendable, to be sure, and there will always be a special place in the club for those players, but just because a player leaves in pursuit of raising the CL trophy high, imo, does not diminish the things they did for their previous club.

true,Battle_Biscuits,null,null,"I spent just under a year looking for a proper graduate job and have only just secured one. I couldn't get on any of the graduate schemes and was eventually offered a job with an SME near where I live. I've just done my first week and unfortunately the role isn't matching my expectations. I thought it was a sales AND marketing role, but so far its 100% sales and i've been cold calling businesses all week trying to sell advertising space. Not pleasant, and i'm not sure how long I'll be able to put up with this job if things don't change.

Some pieces of advice from my own experiences.  

-If you're aiming for a graduate scheme, put all your efforts into applying for them and don't divide your time looking for part time work like I did. Unless you already have significant experience working behind a counter or behind a bar, no employer will take you for those sort of part time jobs because they'll need to train you up and you won't stay. 

-Use whatever means at your disposal to get some sort of work experience whilst you are applying for jobs. In the summer I started volunteering at a debt advice centre and made some websites for them and did some freelance work for my farther's work colleagues. I dressed all this up as freelance work on my CV and it's something that tends to impress employers at interviews. Had I started all this earlier I may well have got a job sooner.

-If you're still in uni, decide what career you want when you finish and tailor your extra- curricular experiences in university towards that career. This is of course easier said than done if you're an indecisive bugger like me, but most other people will have a clearer idea of what they want to do. I was involved in all sorts of activities at university, but none of it was particularly targeted at a particular career.

I don't know much about SL.. perhaps 'moving money out of Scotland' is more than just the planned moving. IDK.

On the oil issue, Salmond has used the amount of oil available to further the independence case, and most in the know seem to believe there is less than he claims. It seems strange to me that BP would be moved to come out against independence, as they would surely be able to hold more power over a smaller Scottish government, and AFAIK Salmond wants lower corporation tax too. do you have that video? (I saw one but it made no claims about oil quantities).

What are the pro-independence companies and what are their points? The anti list is full of a lot of large companies, and they have clear reasons (largely related to not liking uncertainty), so it seems reasonable they have a greater focus. TBH the pro-independence points seem to be for the people not corporations.

The whole room was laughing at him surely because they were all Salmond supporters that had come to support him and the Yes campaign! If you think that room was neutral I'm shocked.

--------

I don't think the BBC news reporting has been fantastic over independence.. most reporting is as bad when you really look into it like you are here, and everyone is biased. Maybe it is just poor (lazy, sensationalism, trying to get a story), or perhaps there are indeed intentions behind it, as the BBC probably doesn't want to risk losing 10% of its licence fees. Either way, if I may be so bold, I think you're looking for things to fit your pre-determined opinion (which you're welcome to have) rather than looking at them objectively; the premise of this thread *has* in fact been debunked. BBC's reporting on the issue being less than perfect (which also happens on issues that are not so charged, people don't get so bothered by them though) does not change that. peace :)",0,1410553256,null,0,false,0,ckglblw,t3_2g73sm,t1_ckglblw,t1_ckgjn8j,null,1427045525,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Tabathock,EN,england,"&gt;Hazard is a better player when his is doing his brilliance in the final third, not tracking opposition fullbacks into our goalbox

I find this type of view really odd. It feels like you're coming from a view point that sees a football pitch divided into thirds, and attacking/defensive duties the sole responsibility of attackers and defenders respectively. Football doesn't work like that. You may have noticed that Branislav  has been involved in quite a few goals recently, he can only do that because of the defensive work rate of the players covering him. If Hazard can't cover the left wing, then Chelsea - even with Azpilicueta or Luis's defensive talent, will be vulnerable. 

Hazard is at his best when he plays in a predictable way for other Chelsea players. He's not the only player on the team, and as you may have noticed recently, bad teams which are well-organised can beat teams with far superior talent. It's not just a case of unshealthing him and letting him run wild. Ironically, some of the flariest players in the world (think Ronaldo, Cruyff, Messi etc) can only work their magic when they are part of a rigid and predictable (to them at least) structure. 

Teams win by scoring more goals than their opposition, they pick up points by conceeding fewer. Hazard's defensive work rate has, at times been appalling. The key example of this was the second leg in the Chelsea  - Atletico match when his poor defensive position, and laze lead to two Atletico goals. 

&gt;Neymar and the other don't have to worry about defending to the extent Hazard does and it will probably result in them getting more goals and assists.

Barcelona are pretty shaky defensively, they tend to counter-act that by keeping lots of possesion and scoring loads. That kind of style was kind of worked out by Jose when he was at Real Madrid, and has been getting much less successful. Chelsea have a much more solid defensive structure and tend to score goals quickly on the counter-attack. The sides play completely differently. Neymar is also a striker, whilst Eden is a winger. You'd expect Neymar - all things being equal to score more. 

&gt;don't have to worry about defending  

Everyone defends in a modern team. Costa/Oscar/Willian/Schurrle will constantly be closing down players - even deep in the opposition half. You just don't see it because I suspect you don't really think of that as ""proper"" defending.

Whatever shall Scotland do, with a John Lewis that charges an extra £2.00 every time you go there. Vote no, and stop this madness! Salmond has gone too far!

Prices could change for a multitude of reasons, it would be irresponsible for John Lewis to say that prices will not rise in an independent Scotland. He has no way of knowing that right now, and neither does anyone else, unless they are specifically planning on doing it anyway.

Not to mention, they only made a statement because the PM begged them. And in no point in that statement did he explicitly say consumer prices will rise, he said ""costs may rise"", which could apply to their own wage bills etc.

&gt;On the oil issue, Salmond has used the amount of oil available to further the independence case, and most in the know seem to believe there is less than he claims. It seems strange to me that BP would be moved to come out against independence, as they would surely be able to hold more power over a smaller Scottish government, and AFAIK Salmond wants lower corporation tax too. do you have that video? (I saw one but it made no claims about oil quantities).

No, an oil company will not have any ""power"" over Scottish government policy, if they want the oil, they abide by the government's rules. Salmond might want to lower corporation tax, its his party's policy and nothing to do with independence. There are other parties who don't want to do that I'm sure. The reason Salmond is lowering it is to compete with the rest of the UK for investment. Nobody can tell you the quantity of oil. They can give you estimates, but the estimates are mainly speculation. That's why estimates from different ""experts"" vary so wildly.

&gt;What are the pro-independence companies and what are their points? The anti list is full of a lot of large companies, and they have clear reasons (largely related to not liking uncertainty), so it seems reasonable they have a greater focus. TBH the pro-independence points seem to be for the people not corporations.

Yes, exactly, they all have clear reasons. They all want money. Its funny how just as recently as a few months ago, these same billionaires who were once so hated on this sub and throughout the country in general, and blamed for every problem we face today, are now the ""experts"" we must listen to for advice.

&gt;If you think that room was neutral I'm shocked.

It was in front of international media, so I suppose they weren't neutral after they saw how out of touch the UK seemed to be about the whole thing.

Cutting and running from what? We'll take our share of the debt, that no matter what Salmond says in unavoidable. We'll take our share of the mess created. So what is it exactly we are cutting and running from? The union? The nation we have built over the last 300 years?

If that's the case why are people all over the UK not campaigning for change? Why are people all over the UK not collectively sick of the same situation that we are? If we are one big country why are some of us, uniquely a different nationality so out of touch with the rest of the population that independence is upon us?

There are people up and down Scotland right now actively engaged in politics in a way that has not been seen for a very long time, there are debates, discussions, protests all over about what we should do.

There's also frequent mention of white snow peaked mountains.

Someone mentioned that the skies of Gallifrey had birds in them, so you could imagine there was both eggs and fowl.

In the books, they mention small edible rodents called '[tafelshrews](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Tafelshrew)' which suggests that at least traditionally, Gallifreyans weren't vegetarians/vegans, and it also mentions that they ate fungus.

It holds the seat of civil government for the United Kingdom, the royal family, largest land area, highest population etc. 

Also, when we think of the top British cultural exports, or least the ones most known to Americans, it seems heavily skewed toward England; some examples of literature would be the works of: Jane Austin, Shakespeer, Charles Dickens, J.K. Rowling, JRR Tolkein. Music: Pink Floyd, Rolling Stones, The Who, Queen. Television: Doctor Who (although the new one is produced in Wales), Downton Abby, Top Gear, Luthor. Moves: James Bond, Tolkien films (The movies are not solely English, but are adapted from English books), Harry Potter (same). 

Obviously there are good examples of these things arising from Scotland and Wales, but it is all very lopsided in England's favor, and this is probably why Americans tend to associate the word 'British' with 'English' . Also, even though we generally consider Northern Ireland to be British, isn't it really United Kingdomish since it isn't actually located on the island of Britain?

Immigration may be less of a problem for the English if Scotland becomes the way the SNP says they want it to become, with the major public funding etc. If I were an immigrant trying to get into a country that speaks English, I'd go to an independent Scotland, rather than the whole mess that exists in England.

I doubt Sanchez will start, though I'd probably put him in to deal with Sterling, personally.

He's better there now, but he's not often put under the cosh and I think someone like Delph can rattle him. 

We match up nicely with Liverpool because of how much they push forward, and their narrow midfield diamond plus frankly questionable quality at fullback vs our pace on the flanks is good for us.

So I reckon we can possibly get a draw out of this. If ""Good Andi"" shows up, we'll have a good chance, because he'll get us on the scoresheet. However, if ""Bad Andi"" shows up, we'll struggle to get a goal, and I don't think we can keep them out for the full ninety. Even with Concrete Ron and Senderock/Rockore.

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2012-10-02/currency-debasement-social-collapse-4-case-studies

There's lots of papers and books on this. That's just a good overview piece. 
As for the between 2-3% as a target for inflation. I'll set aside the moral aspect of stealing by reducing purchasing power and the economic impact but I'd encourage you to look at how inflation is calculated(CPI in particular) It has been changed many times over the years. It's a hell of a lot higher than that. Just look at the cost of the things you buy or the amount of goods you're getting for that price. Many companies reduce the amount they give you slightly and charge the same price. That's still inflation. 

If you get 10% less toilet paper per pack, over the course of a year you have to buy 10% more. 

Currencies that aren't backed by anything, such as gold, that can be printed arbitrarily are only worth anything as long as  the market has confidence in them. Once that goes you'll be burning the money to keep warm in winter. 1920's German learnt that the hard way. 

Imagine a Britain that had a stable money supply. Without inflation, the purchasing power would go up. People would be able to buy more every year with the money they have. No need for constant pay increases. The government wouldn't be able to bribe the people with unsustainable schemes, fight unnecessary wars, bail out banks and other failing businesses .

You've literally extrapolated that from a tiny statement. Anyway...

There is virtually no harm in Hazard working harder defensively. I don't think it inhibits his growth as a player to the extent which you've claimed in other comments either. What is true, and you'd be hard-pressed to deny it, is that last season as a team Hazard's defensive work saved us from the opposition scoring multiple times and creating chances multiple times. And ultimately that is what it boils down to. Mourinho places the value of the team above a player, as any manager should, and his defensive work is vastly more important for the team than it is for him as an individual.

I'm sorry, but I don't think you have any idea what you stand for. If you truly believe you are a progressive or a liberal then there is no way you can reconcile that with these Nationalist feelings, or with the idea that Scotland should pander to the interests of the wealthy minority by lowering taxes on corporations. The answer is very clear: progressives must work together to improve the lives for *all people everywhere*: in the UK, in Scotland, in Europe and in the rest of the world. Progressivism does not make any accommodation for the kind of self-interested 'fuck you I've got mine' attitude of this Nationalism you are promoting. So no, you do not 'grab the chance' to fuck over the rest of the progressives in the UK with the vague promises of some dodgy politician with a completely unproven record when it comes to social justice. That is the coward's way out and I will be extremely sad if the majority of Scots abandon the liberal principles they claim are holding them apart from England and follow the fucking pied piper into fairyland.

If you think oil companies, that will make up 17% of the Scottish economy will have zero power with a Scotish government you're delusional. They can turn off the taps and reduce exploration if they aren't happy. Of course, this won't usually be in their interests, but the option is there as a real threat to Scotland's income if they so wished.

Estimates involve a lot of speculation, absolutely, but not purely so.. it's clear that the businesses involved are far better placed to judge than the SNP are.

I'm 42, and Scottish independence has went from being a fringe dream of mostly ethnic nutters to a (mostly) positive, all encompassing movement that is within touching distance of happening. 

This was a long process, involving the 79 debacle, the Smith/Dewar push for the Scottish Parliament, then the SNPs rise (aided by Labour's shift to the right). And also involving so many ordinary people making up their mind, discussing, persuading, canvassing - ordinary folk getting political, thinking something different.

I hope it happens in England/rUK, regardless of the result on Thursday. Westminster has prevented real change as it hordes power, and for whatever reason the political disrupters down south have been much more right wing. Equally, we should never have had a situation where Scots Labour MPs were voting on controversial legislation that only affected rUK, all the while knowing their own constituents would be unaffected (to give the SNP their due, their MPs never vote on English only stuff).

But we all deserve something better. Up here, many of us have decided to agitate for independence as we cannot see meaningful change from Westminster, and we wish to have self determination. I love England, and if there had been another viable means of reform that ever looked likely to happen maybe we would not be here.

But I hope you get change if we vote Yes. And if we vote No I'll join you in pushing for it.

&gt; John Lewis stated clearly they have higher operating costs for stores in Scotland, and that in the event of independence they would no longer share these costs with the rest of the UK budget. It was not hand wavy 'prices might go up like they could anywhere at any time' BS like you are trying to make it out to be. You don't have to care, but you're claiming it was a false claim, it is categorically not.

He said ""could"", not ""will"", and he never directly implied that the consumer price would rise, he only said ""costs"". You are making an argument out of thin air. If operating costs are higher in Scotland, why aren't the prices higher now?

This John Lewis thing, it makes no supporters look ridiculous. Its an argument about a quid or 2 on your shopping bill. Do you really think this is why we are voting for independence? 

John Lewis can charge what it likes in Scotland or elsewhere, it doesn't make one bit of difference. If this is you argument fr not being independent then you have already lost.

&gt;If you think oil companies, that will make up 17% of the Scottish economy will have zero power with a Scotish government you're delusional. They can turn off the taps and reduce exploration if they aren't happy. Of course, this won't usually be in their interests, but the option is there as a real threat to Scotland's income if they so wished.
Estimates involve a lot of speculation, absolutely, but not purely so.. it's clear that the businesses involved are far better placed to judge than the SNP are.

""Turn off the taps"", what would happen if they turned off the taps within the UK? Don't you think the Scottish government will do the exact same thing? I don't quite think you fully understand the gravity of independence or what powers it gives a country. ""Turning off the taps"" would result in legal action, if ""the taps"" still weren't ""turned on"", those ""taps"" would be taken off of the company. It wasn't all that long ago that North Sea oil belonged to everyone and not a few billionaires.

&gt;That is the point of a business, yes. I made no judgement about them being good or that you should give a shit, that's just you getting antsy. They do know what is in their interests and have some level of expertise in what they do, though.

Alex Salmond is an economist, therefore he knows about economy. I trust an economist with my country's economy more than the bankers and billionaires who destroyed it only 6 years ago.

I think it is an absolutely awesome thing for you to do and very generous, so thank you and I'm sure anyone who gets the codes will be very grateful.

I just feel that's a bit fairer. There are a lot of people who go unnoticed and of course, I cannot name them for purely that reason, and it will give them a chance to win a code, I think everyone deserves a fair shout, we're all brothers in red here after all.

Then why are you talking about it then?

International Credit Ratings will take it into account. They aren't stupid, they're there to give banks and investors accurate ratings of debt. They aren't going to ignore the fact that Scotland has just dumped its debt onto another nation.

Moodys have already stated that if talks get bogged down between Scotland and the UK then Scotland will end up with a Junk credit rating.

Even if things go swimmingly, then Scotland will still be given a rating two notches below the UK on par with Mexico.


http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27247870

&gt;However, the report noted that Scotland would risk starting off with a speculative-grade rating - commonly referred to as ""junk"" - if the independence vote triggered protracted, acrimonious talks between London and Edinburgh.

&gt;**But Moody's said ""potential risks"" to this assessment would arise if Scotland refused to assume a ""fair and proportionate share"" of its debt obligations, which would increase the UK's net debt burden and would be considered credit negative.**

&gt;It also said a potential currency union between an independent Scotland and the remainder of the UK would be credit negative if it was to materialise.


This is what I mean, YES supporters just sprout any old shit to get people to buy into their false idea of lala perfect land and they just ignore reality day after day.


Even with a credit rating agency stating right to your face that if you ditch the debt your credit rating is going to be a hit I bet you still won't accept it and will just move along and carry on lying to everyone else you meet and talk to about it.

Your experience is commonplace. Many new riders crash because the only instruction they have taken was their CBT. CBT is nowhere near sufficient training to be able to ride safely. How you proceed from here is up to you, but here are a few possibilities:

[Wages rise with inflation even for the bottom 20% of the income distribution](http://imgur.com/a/1f4Wt). You're forgetting that all income comes from someone else's spending - if prices are lower, everyone has to spend fewer pounds, so everyone earns fewer pounds and no-one's better off. Your argument is [the inflation fallacy](http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2011/11/the-inflation-fallacy.html). Deflation doesn't mean you can buy more stuff.

Deflation prevents any stabilisation during a recession as interest rates cannot be lowered enough due to the [zero lower bound](http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/7603/economics/zero-lower-bound-rate-zlb/), and greatly increases unemployment because [nominal wages cannot be cut](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/09/why_dont_wages.html). It also increases the real value of debt, meaning that debtors cut their spending, reducing other people's income, causing them to cut their spending, and creating a vicious cycle of economic depression. Similarly, if people expect prices to fall they'll delay some spending to when prices do fall, which will reduce other people's income and spending, creating a second vicious cycle.

[CPI takes account of changes in size.](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/consumer-price-indices--a-brief-guide.pdf#page=13) If you have to buy 10% more toilet paper over the course of a year that's recorded as a 10% price increase for toilet paper.

[The independent Billion Prices Project tracks CPI data very closely.](http://bpp.mit.edu/usa/). There is simply no evidence that inflation is a hell of a lot higher than 2-3%. ([Shadowstats is bullshit.](http://azizonomics.com/2013/06/01/the-trouble-with-shadowstats/))

Weimar hyperinflation was due to [the German money supply increasing from 115,000,000 marks in January 1922 to 497,000,000,000,000,000,000 marks in December 1923](https://www.inkling.com/read/macroeconomics-hubbard-obrien-4th/chapter-14/the-german-hyperinflation-of) - an annual rate of about 2,000,000%. Independent modern central banks will never print money at that rate, because they know it would cause hyperinflation and devastate the economy. The highest annual rate of growth of the monetary base (in the US) since 1984 was 113%, in 2009, and the M2 money stock (the type of money supply that actually causes inflation) has not grown at more than 10% a year over this period. Because of this, there is no reason for the markets to suddenly lose all confidence in the currency. It's utterly incomparable to Weimar Germany.

You can still find those kind of regulars if you get lucky with a season ticket in the right areas though. You're unlikely to find them towards the back of level 3 though, where most tickets are available nowadays, daytripper central up there apparently.

The new tier above the south stand might be worth a shout mate if you want to get the bug back?

A lot of people will be relocating in there due to the club, shamelessly, bumping up some level 2 season tickets to £1250 at the next renewal when the expansion is complete. So there should be a lot of old timers among them.

At the core of the ideology is the assumption that the majority of a nation has shared culture and hereditary features - fine, I can get that. The problem is that often, in order to serve political purposes, ethnic nationalism has been used to drum up hatred or fear. 

The historical context is pretty clear, the best example being Nazi Germany. Where pride in the German ethnicity led to the assumption that the German people were superior to many others (Slavs in particular). This idea was propagated by the government to serve as justification for the morally abhorrent treatment of the 'other'.

Ethnic nationalism, as it exists in the early writing of Greek philosophers, is a perfectly natural ideology but history has taught us it often leads to hatred and division, which go against our modern notions of multiculturalism. It's quite easy to argue that the concept of ethnic superiority is a bit of an anachronism in this regard.

The idea of civic nationalism however is much more appealing. It relies on concepts such as 'the general will' and social contract theory, where individuals gain power and privilege through participation in civic matters (not simply by the basis of their ethnicity).",0,1410563064,null,0,false,0,ckgq4u5,t3_2g82ng,t1_ckgq4u5,t1_ckgmxpu,null,1427042751,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

This is a completely inconsistent conclusion to draw. I would agree that Scotland has tended to vote more left-wing in recent decades than, say, England. However, no progressive can possibly stomach the idea that in order to achieve success of the progressive ideal of a fair and just society, he must segment the society in which he lives along some arbitrary and ridiculous border (such as the historical borders of Scotland) and only secure the progressive society for those lucky enough to be born on the right side of that border, leaving the progressives in the UK far less likely to succeed in securing that society for themselves in the absence of Scottish progressive voters.

Further to which, you seem not even vaguely interested in the idea that progressivism is incontrovertibly and internationalist movement. There is absolutely no way to reconcile Nationalism with progressivism. You must decide which you call yourself. If you are a Nationalist then you must adopt that moniker and admit that which you stand for: the furthering of the rights of people born in Scotland only, and with no regard paid to your comrades in other countries.

It's probably more prominent here because of the stigma the Brummie accent has.

There's also some interesting qualities to younger Brummy people's accents that are entirely new, like -th fronting (saying -th as -f), t-glottalling (dropping -t for glottal stops), -h dropping as well.

* Personally, I think there will be some form of currency agreement, but it won't be called a ""currency union"". I think the UK and Sterling benefits from having Scottish oil and gas on the balance of payments and also from not paying transaction fees. I would like to see a Scottish pound and a central bank though, something like the Danish krone (which is pegged to the Euro).

* The SNP is proposing a CU because that's what the Working Group Fiscal Commission report (written by 5 world leading economists) recommended as the best option for Scotland. I don't see this as a major issue (despite the media attention it's been getting), as there are other options if negotiations fall through. If the UK don't want a CU, I'm okay with that. I think it's reasonable to believe the UK might be bluffing on their ""no way"" stance, and we'll see if they change their tune if there is a Yes vote. I don't think anything is off the table.

* Scotland has been a member of the EU for 40 years as part of the UK. EU citizens live and work in Scotland and vice versa. Our laws are already compatible with EU laws. There is no legal way to take EU citizenship from Scottish EU citizens. I am not convinced it's in the EU's interest to lose any of its citizens or land mass, and I believe Scotland's membership (like Greenland and East Germany) will be treated as a special case for the reasons stated above. I don't see any reason why there wouldn't be seamless membership, it wouldn't benefit anyone to make it more complicated than it needs to be.

* Again, there are other options if a CU doesn't occur (I'm noticing a theme with these questions), including fixed peg &amp; floating peg. There will likely be short term downsides to whichever option is chosen, but this isn't a decision for the next 5 years, and in the long term I see these issues ironing themselves out.

* Scotland isn't some husk that is a burden on the UK, it's a net contributor and it's valuable (why else would the establishment be fighting to keep us?) The UK is in a lot of debt, and I'm sure Scotland can bargain well by accepting a share of UK debt.

That if I take pride in what I view as my national identity it **must** come in the form of nasty, deplorable, ignorant *ethnic* nationalism. It doesn't. 

Let me give you a quick example. 

If I ask you to think of symbols of *British* culture, what do you think of?

I can pretty much guarantee that 99/100 people you ask that question to anywhere in the world would *never* say Kilts/Shortbread/Whisky/Haggis and so on. 

My nationality is a *sub*-nationality of another and that other is wholly dominated by a different sub nationality. I'm not saying that's a *bad* thing, I'm not saying there aren't cross overs because of course there are and I love almost all of them.

It's got absolutely nothing to do with blood, or race or any of that pathetic stuff. I'm not *better* than anyone else, I'm not different at-all. It's just culture. I've spent my entire life being told on one hand that I'm British yet on the other having a lot of the culture I actually identify with being put in a separate box labelled Scottish. 

I don't particularly care if you think it's silly or if you think other bonds are more important. It doesn't even matter if it makes logical sense.

For example you have Germany making a lot more money in a very different way to say Greece. Scotland and the rest of the UK would be theoretically more balanced in this regard i.e. similar GDP per capita and debt per person. I'm not sure if this changes anything.

I think the primary problem with this argument is that actually the economies of 'UK' and Scotland are more different than you might think - and after independence they will only diverge further. There is already significant lag between Peaks/Troughs in GDP for example, although both come out even over time. The problem is that the UK would be entitled and required to protect it's own interests first, and this could lead to detrimental impacts on Scotland over time as the Economies lose sync.

I am sorry but I do not understand how this makes sense? Why would any manager *not* allow originality and creativity? You are acting as if Mourinho is doing a favor allowing him these ""privilieges"". Being able to be creative is how you play as an attacker, its not a tactic.. You can't tell someone, ""Hey Joe, stop that, you are being too creative!"".

&gt; If anything it's striking a deal with Hazard: track back and don't slack, I'll let you get away with trying crazy shit in attack. If anything it has freed Hazard.

Again, all you are saying is that Mourinho makes him defend as well as attack, which is basically what I have been saying. I don't see how you think that makes him freer than before.

Hazard is best in attack, for the good of the team he should be allowed to stay up in defense so he can spark counter attack and start moves. Having him down deep in our half helps us less than if he could start and make goals from counters. 

The best deals for Hazard would be: stay up and attack as much as you want, just make sure to make/score goals. Ronaldo, Robben, Reus, they more or less follow that type of rule.

The thing that I enjoy about Dr. Who and Moffat is that there is the obvious plot and there are so many more hidden gems in every episode and every arch.

You talked about The Crack and how obvious it was, but I think the subtle question that is still unanswered in 10/11 was the secret of River Song. Was the crack REALLY the issue? We kind of knew that wouldn't be the problem since River did come back.

I think the way the show is written is that there is an obvious overlaying arch [obviously] so that viewers who do not like to do thought exercises can enjoy the show. Then those that want to deeply analyze the show scene by scene can still find many hidden gems.

[Spoilers] Up to S08E03

So you talk about this season being ""the promised land"" and it's true they keep beating it over the head, but I see so many different things.

0801 - How did the Dinosaur really get there? To my knowledge, the TARDIS cannot transport things that are outside the TARDIS. If this were true, then potentially the Doctor could move worlds. This could open a lot of potential plot development in the future.

0802 - You talked about the crack in the previous season. Well, what about the crack inside the Dalek? To me, it did look very similar to the crack in Amy's room, also the Silence really did not get resolved yet.

0803 - What was on the spoon? Why is the Doctor's button repaired? These robots had a course set for the promised land but the same (I assume) robots in 0801 kept ""looking"" never knowing ""where"" the promised land was.

I really don't think this season is about The Promised Land, but I think it's really about Clara and who she really is. Who gave her the Doctor's phone number, how did the Doctor know to wait for Clara's call (Bells of Saint John)?

So you agree that he's grown since his first year? Your argument was that Jose asking Hazard to do defensive work inhibits his development. Based on the stats it clearly hasn't inhibited anything, in fact he has become a better player. If you think that's wrong then prove it.

Also, if you had an ounce of footballing knowledge you'd know that even at a younger age players get played in various different positions to make them well rounded players. It doesn't inhibit shit. It actually makes them better players.

There is virtually no similarities between Ronaldo and Hazard's game except that they both play on the left wing (Ronaldo a lot of the time doesn't even play on the left wing) and that they're both pacey dribblers. Ronaldo plays more as a forward, while Hazard is a self-proclaimed playmaker. Comparing Hazard to Ribery or Iniesta would be more appropriate and guess what, they both do their defensive duties whilst still being huge threats in attack. Even Robben tracks back to help out his defence now.

One more point. If you're suggesting that we should compromise our defensive structure because, according to you, it will inhibit one player's performance, then I'm sorry to say you are watching the wrong game.

true,grollcool,null,null,"&gt; So you agree that he's grown since his first year? Your argument was that Jose asking Hazard to do defensive work inhibits his development.

Yes a player getting better after playing in a new league for a whole season doesn't exactly take a rocket scientist to figure out, but you seem to have trouble with it..

&gt; Also, if you had an ounce of footballing knowledge you'd know that even at a younger age players get played in various different positions to make them well rounded players.

When they are like fucking 16, not professional players at Chelsea who are turning 24 next year. Do you not know anything about football?

&gt; One more point. If you're suggesting that we should compromise our defensive structure because, according to you, it will inhibit one player's performance, then I'm sorry to say you are watching the wrong game. Football is a team game, not an individual sport.

You play the tactics that **most benefit the team**. Players who can score or make goals can win games, the more they are allowed to do this the more chance you can win games. Its really that simple. That is why players like Ronaldo and Robben are allowed to stay up, because their ability to score outweighs any defensive contribution they would do instead. ( HAZARD SCORED THE MOST GOALS AND MADE THE MOST ASSISTS IN THE ENTIRE TEAM LAST SEASON)

Hazard playing more a more attacking role is better for the team as a whole than him playing more defensive. He is a shit defender and a brilliant attacker, if you cannot understand that then please stop typing.

true,Eddie_Hitler,null,null,"&gt; A minimum of 37 years before being eligible for parole seems a remarkable sensible sentence these days.

In the US you get 40 years for jumping a red light :-)

There was this one: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-22871991 - one murder gets 42 years.  Back in 2008 a couple of Glasgow gangland toerags got 35 years each for a shooting - those were the highest ever minimum tariffs handed down in Scotland.

Murder with a firearm generally comes in at 30+ years, and I've got a funny feeling 30 years is the mandatory starting point these days.  Shooting murders have always attracted higher penalties anyway, because they're usually so brutal and there's usually no defence on the victim's part.

But yes, there has been what you could call ""sentence inflation"".

&gt;[Wages rise with inflation even for the bottom 20% of the income distribution](http://imgur.com/a/1f4Wt). You're forgetting that all income comes from someone else's spending - if prices are lower, everyone has to spend fewer pounds, so everyone earns fewer pounds and no-one's better off. Your argument is [the inflation fallacy](http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2011/11/the-inflation-fallacy.html). Deflation doesn't mean you can buy more stuff.


So falling prices are bad for the economy because people spend less of their money, so everyone gets poorer? Look around your room. Probably a big TV, personal computer, mobile phone. Now think of the cost of these items 25 years ago.  They were very expensive to produce few people had them. The fact that production increased and prices fell ment everyone benefited. The investors got good returns to put in to new projects and the consumer won because they are have stuff they want.  

The fact you think people when spend less if prices fall isn't based on the evidence around you. Why do people queue for sales because things are cheaper and they can buy more for their money. People want things, we live in a consumer society, the stuff we buy that we don't need is endless. If the stuff were cheaper we'd buy more .  This is a good thing in an economic sense because it fuels industry and job creation to make the more things that we can't even imagine there's a need for right now. 
 

Your trying to justify inflation in the sense that it increase wages, well of course it does but if you can buy less because the purchasing power has been degradated, it has the opposite effect on the economy. Businesses close because people can no longer afford the luxury items in their lifes.  Take pubs for example, increased prices have closed 1000's of our pubs. The demand is still there people still drink but they have no longer afford £3+ a pint. 

http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-1633409/Historic-inflation-calculator-value-money-changed-1900.html

Examples from within the link, price inflation 1999-2013

Average wages 41%
Pint of milk 35%
Loaf of bread 143%
Pint of beer 65%
Bottle of wine 42%
Litre of petrol 108%
Consumer debt increased 152%

GOLD 358%  

So wages have grown 41% most other things out of these common items have increased by more than that. Making people poorer. compare that to gold, also know as real money. Used for thousands of years because of the fact that it's scarce, has intrinsic value and can't be made by the printing press. Goods are getting cheaper to produce we should have more.  If you were been paid in a fix amount of gold life would be pretty good right now. Instead we have more debt than ever and people are suffering. 


Interest rates

I'd ask to look Austrian business cycle theory, if nothing else comes out of our little debate. It gave me a new perspective on the world's economic troubles. 

http://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Austrian_Business_Cycle_Theory

Basically it states that artificially tampering with interest rates is the cause of the boom and bust cycle we have been having over the last half century or so.  Interest rates should be a reflection of savings rates and would be if money couldn't be created out of thin air. If savings were high interest rates would be low because there's more capital available to lend, if savings where low interest rates would be high because of the short supply. What happens, when interest rates are low, credit is cheap and easily available. 


Mises has the best analogy of this. 
See master builder before continuing. 
http://mises.org/daily/3220

The master builders are business men and women making businesses that are only suitable because of the low interest rates. Once market conditions go back to normal they can't survive. So all the resources put into them have gone to waste, they aren't helping society in the long term. This is why interest rates are still at 0.5%  the economy is built on sand right now and even a small increase in interest rates would put us back in recession.  

We need a recession because we're proping up business of all kinds which included the banks with monopoly money. We need to let businesses fail and be replace by competent people. The government can not create jobs or affect the market in any way apart from negatively. 

I know I haven't addressed everything but I'm up early for work tomorrow because you keynesians keep stealing my purchasing power so I can't buy as much stuff.

British empire did a lot of fucked up and evil shit, on par with the Nazis (Boer war concentration camps, Irish famine) and practically broke countries for it's also self gain, however it was undoubtedly beneficial on a whole. This is why I hate the pacifistic nature of the western world, or at least the illusion of it tries to give of. Unfortunately, evil deeds, cruelty and wars are perfectly justified in my eyes if it's means gaining your country power and your population better lives. What would Britain look like today without the empire? Would we even want to live in it? The Empire was selfish and evil, but it was all in the name of making home a better place, forunately it also paid of for a lot of other countries such as: India (if it actually fucking spent it's money on it's citizens), Australia, Canada, 16 minor colonies, USA even the south of Africa (compare the south to the north). Great men and corrupt men sat in the commons in London and accepted that Britain shall build an empire and accepted in the course of that innocent people would die and some of the most evil deeds on the planet would be committed, but we accepted that in the course of that, we would be carving out a better future.

Look at world war two, like it or not, without it, life wouldn't be better off today, it would be much worse. What the Nazis did were inexcusable, but WW2 as a whole, brought us great things: Submarines, UN, the Atom age, RADAR, computers, Geneva convention, mas usage of radio, great alliances, medical awareness and disease control. But people like to be pacifists these days, they don't like the idea of anybody dying or any evil deed being done whatsoever. But unfortunately in the world we live in: You're either corrupt, corrupted or you cease to exist. Name a country that hasn't done anything evil that still exists as an influential power today. Now, I'm not justifying evil deeds, I'm just not being ignorant about them and pointing out the silver-lining which a lot of the time greatly outweighs the evil deed it's self. But I also won't justify my country bending over and taking it in the arse anymore, because every time Britain seeks out it's own interests some leader of a country brings up evil deeds from the empire days. I've actually heard Scots bring up battles from 700 years ago. 

The way I see it. you either want to be an influential power and accept in the course of that evil deeds will be committed but for the better (hopefully) or you declare yourself irrelevant, don't do anything beneficial whatsoever and go live on a giant ice cube like Iceland. I would definitely stand by that the benefits given to the world from the empire massively outweigh it's horrendous crimes. I would definitely stand by that without the Empire, most of the western world would be far worse off, USA likely wouldn't even exist.

In that case, good to know that you now agree Jose's tactics didn't in fact inhibit Hazard's performances.

&gt;When they are like fucking 16, not professional players at Chelsea who are turning 24 next year. Do you not know anything about football?

Lol.. Really? I must be insane then because from what I remember, Ivanovic was a CB when we signed him at 23 and converted him into playing at RB. Didn't seem to affect his growth. Converted Duff to playing RW. Converted Robben to playing RW. Made them both better players. Played Lassana Diarra at RB at 23 didn't affect his growth either. Fucking £25m Essien was converted to playing at DM, RB and CB and he was a beast. 

&gt;You play the tactics that most benefit the team. Players who can score or make goals can win games, the more they are allowed to do this the more chance you can win games. Its really that simple.

My God. You are talking like a child now. If its really that simple, why not play with 10 forwards? Nobody has to do any defensive work because ""the more you are allowed to do the more chance you can win games"".

Shocking.

&gt;That is why players like Ronaldo and Robben are allowed to stay up, because their ability to score outweighs any defensive contribution they would do instead. 

You clearly don't watched Bayern. Robben tracks back. He tracks back a lot. Its been one of the main reasons why Bayern are such a solid side. EVERYONE contributes defensively. Even fucking Mandzukic used to run back to help out full-backs from time to time.

&gt;Hazard playing more a more attacking role is better for the team as a whole than him playing more defensive. He is a shit defender and a brilliant attacker, if you cannot understand that then please stop typing.

""He is a shit defender and a brilliant attacker""... Excellent analysis Sherlock. That's exactly why he's being taught to defend!

Your whole argument is naive, so naive in fact that you are assuming that Mourinho has never handled players like Hazard. Trust me, he has. Not on one or two occasions, but several. Including a player whom he made in Deco, who was one of the best attacking midfielders in Europe at one point. Sneijder, who had poor stats was part of a bigger structure at Inter.

If Time of the Doctor starts soon after this, then he should at most be around 1600 years old when he transforms into 12.  In the season premier, his transformation is recent.  Therefore, either 400 years passed between Day of the Doctor and Time of the Doctor, or there's an incongruity.  If the former is true, Matt Smith's doctor lived 1100 years, more than all other Doctors combined, and didn't start aging until that incarnation was 800 years old.  This also implies that each Doctor except Matt Smiths regenerates long before their age limit.  If the Time Lords hadn't reset his regens, he would have died young for a Time Lord (13 regens * 1100 years per incarnation = 14,300 years average life for a Time Lord).  Then again, he does regenerate into random ages, and the War Doctor was 800 in his ""illegitimate 9th incarnation"", and *ouch! my head hurts...

true,thousandyardsnare,null,null,"Think of it this way: If Hazard simply stays up he field and waits for attacks then Dave/someone else has to cover the space and this puts the team in a position where they have fewer men pressuring the opposition forwards/midfield. This in turn means Chelsea are less likely to win back possession and puts our goal area at greater risk. Staying up has these knock on effects and the net result is that the game is less comfortable for Chelsea. I agree that if he stays up top he is more likely to be in a good position on the break/receiving long balls/etc, but the net result is Chelsea play with more unease in defence with fewer people covering. If Hazard defends it's easier for Dave and others to move up the field under less pressure and put Hazard into more situations where he can do what he does best.

true,jester92800,num5,,"Couple things to help you as a fellow American:

- Not many people refer to the club as ""Hotspur"".  Really, the worst thing you can do is pluralize the name ('hotspurs' or 'spurs').  I would suggest that you stick to ""spurs"" or ""Tottenham"" though in conversation-- no worries though, some people will get really bent out of shape but I'm just tryin to help here.

- Watch a few old games!  They can be a bit tricky to find sometimes, but with some digging you can find some gooduns.  I'd work from the more recent incarnations backwards so you get familiar with some players/personalities that are still with the club.  There are a bunch of good ones out there.

- Google ""Danny Rose Arsenal Goal"".  People will mention it offhand, and it wont hurt to know what they mean.  Arsenal, as someone else mentioned, is our chief rival, both geographically and due to the fact that they're all massive cunts.  Think of the Michigan/OSU rivalry, only twice as intense.

- I personally recommend ""The Fighting Cock"" podcast-- it's a Spurs centered pod run by a group of spurs fan friends, and it's fucking hilarious.  Additionally, check out ""Men in Blazers"" and ""Football Weekly"".  You'll learn a lot about the sport, the league, and the different teams by listening to these.

Did anything actually come of those things either? No.

Like someone else in this posting said, it's just to highlight the mad scientist aspect of it, much like the fishfingers/custard was to highlight the initial childlike aspect of the last Doctor and the bowtie was to highlight the almost contradictory old-man, out-of-touch-with-fashion aspect (ironically bringing them back into fashion, but that's beyond the point).

And why is theories about plot so much more important than character work nowadays? I didn't mean to shun the fact it's a random quirk at all - random quirks are what make the Doctor the Doctor, and without them he wouldn't be who he is in each iteration. Ultimately, the fishfingers and custard/bowtie things are something people with remember about the 11th long after memories have faded about cracks in time and him being Amy/Rory's son-in-law.

So I'd hope these equations aren't a simple plot contrivance as I like thinking about the 12th being some sort of mad scientist and hope this random quirk continues, much like I like thinking about the 4th and his scarf. I don't want a great character quirk to turn into some one-time plot idea and then have it dropped afterwards!

I figure that you guys are in the learning process in all this so here are just a couple things that I didn't like: The opening part where you were describing how each of you became a fan just didn't feel right to me. We as fans don't really listen to sports podcasts for that kind of thing. We want to hear breaking news, strategy, in depth analysis of a players game, or pregame/postgame analysis.

The US is the most powerful entity that uses it, so therefore has control over it.  If say China started using it, then they could possibly gain control of it (though it would need to recognised by the majority of nations).  If say Belgium started using the dollar, they would have next to no control or influence over it.

Military equipment and debt can be divided up. They can also be moved around.

No.  That's not what straight edge is.

&gt; by not doing those things you're not affecting the world in the slightest.

By not doing those things I am showing people that you don't have to, no matter how reinforced their cultural acceptance is.

&gt; Alcohol, tobacco and drugs are just inanimate objects, it makes literally no difference to the world if someone drinks a couple of beers on an evening or doesn't.

What... because nothing bad has ever happened from drinking a couple of beers. 

&gt; Now addiction is bad, but you're not working to prevent or remedy addiction now are you, you're just saying I'm going to choose a healthy lifestyle. 

That's not what I'm saying at all.  Though abstinence is a complete and total remedy for addiction.  What I am saying has nothing to do with physical health.  It has to do with being self-aware.  Knowing why one makes the decisions they make, not just because of cultural coercion.

&gt; Seriously you're making it into a real cult - making the world a better place? Tattoos so especially significant they can only be inked by a fellow devotee? All you're doing is what comes naturally to human beings anyway not exploring a religious belief.

There is a large % of the Scottish population from all ethnic backgrounds that want a form if government that is voted for only by the inhabitants of Scotland and responsible only to those people. With full control over all matters.

It's not an anti vote it's a pro democracy vote.

Unfortunately to get that it seems the only choice is full independence. 

I have an English wife and many English family members and spend a lot of time time in Surrey and Kent. I'm not anti anything but the lack of a truly representative and answerable government with full control of the countries matters. I also feel for the many English, welsh and Irish voters who also feel disenfranchised by the current political system but we in Scotland cannot help them, they must do as we did and spend time constantly pushing the government to change.

The example you just gave was Davies era: Moffat doesn't seem as interested with this style of storytelling, despite what you claim. He's more into quirks and personality things or obvious 'things to notice' (that are explictly pointed out in dialogue and bigger scenes than the sums have been) than he is in setting up subtle Chekov's guns.

Moffat's ongoing plots are far more obvious - you see something happen in one episode and in the next it's explicitly explained and then a twist happens to propel it into the next episode. Like basically what happened in Season 6; three episodes in and we'd at least have some sort of snippet like:

--Clara: Hey, what are you doing with all those sums anyway?

--Doctor (hiding away chalk in his pocket): Oh..nothing.

--He takes a long, sideways glance at the sums and frowns.

Nah - way more likely, given Moffat's writing, that this is just a quirk unless it's obviously pointed out as not just a quirk. Again, not to put him down as a writer - but subtlety isn't really his approach (which is a good thing in a big, bombastic, sci-fi show for kids too, in my opinion). Even his most 'Chekhov's gun' thing so far - the cracks in time leading to the Big Bang - were highlighted as a 'big thing' in every episode they appeared in.

Don't get me wrong, though: I'm sure - and would actually hope - that calculations will be a part of how he solves some mysteries sometimes. Except they will just be a way to play into the quirk itself - that the Doctor is a mad scientist type who can use maths to get one up on the bad guy. I just don't think an ongoing specific sequence he's trying to 'work out' continually will end up becoming a big reveal for a big ongoing plot.",0,1410585952,null,0,1410586522,0,ckgysoo,t3_2g8c13,t1_ckgysoo,t1_ckgvtgy,null,1427037860,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,DaggerToTheHeart,null,null,"I spent 4 years managing a very high end restaurant, and although I did see the bartender and the top couple of servers often pulling down 30%+ tips, the numbers at the end of the night for everyone still ended up averaging closer to 20-22%.  

I definitely think those sorts of tips are POSSIBLE, and I am also a big tipper because I am sympathetic to service industry people, but it definitely isn't the norm, and often times is not really even appropriate.  I'm sure the server loves it, but it sets a bad example to only tip that high at a fine dining establishment.  In my experience, fine dining workers are somewhat more knowledgable, but work MUCH less than  say, workers at a diner.  Fine dining tends to keep the sections small, 3-5, and I have seen sections at a brew pub that were up to 14 per server, all 4 tops, which if you have ever attempted this... it's a fucking nightmare.  THOSE people deserve the larger tips, if anyone does,  not the fine dining guy who is already getting 12/hr (even in Illinois, which has server minimum wage of 4.95, I got 12/hr as a fine dining server) for his slightly better than average wine knowledge for a waiter.  If anyone should get higher tips at a  fine dining establishment, it's the cooks, and of course the bartender if he is flair bartending or making damn good craft cocktails.  I made an absurd amount of money as a fine dining server, moving to management there was a horrible idea, but after that experience I would never, ever do fine dining again.  The customers are just awful, I'd probably put it on par with a Denny's, but on the opposite end of the douchebag spectrum.

Also, I do agree with the server-patron relationship building.  In a way, it's like slipping a doorman a little something extra to let you in without waiting in line, I suppose.  The customers that tipped me HUGE one time, I will remember their name if they told me.  Customers that 20-25% consistently get my attention right away and I will do my best to memorize their name, favorite drinks, favorite foods, favorite sports teams, etc.  Customers that tip me HUGE every single time they come in... well...  I know I shouldn't do it, but I will de-prioritize other customers to help those people out, because despite the possibility of losing a few bucks on one table pales in comparison to the extra 100 bucks I'm getting from the rich old couple that loves me and requests that I be their server every visit.

true,Grumbillz,null,null,"Dear AC Milan,

Some advice on Torres: Firstly, there was a lot of attention and commentary on his transfer, which puts a lot of pressure on the lad, so don't judge him on his first season when he doesn't become the world-class striker you had hoped for. 

Also, goals are such a outdated form of judging strikers. Take note of how enthusiastic Torres is, and how professional he always carries himself. He will of course unprofessionally sulk every now and then, and his enthusiasm levels will evaporate as he continually makes sure the corner flags are alright during a game, but strikers are high-strung creatures so it's really unfair to judge him on that.

Torres was an absolute beast at Liverpool in 2007, so that is more than enough justification for continuing with Torres despite his lack of performance, at the expense of any younger prospects, who should be judged harshly on whatever scraps of gametime they manage to win.

The most important thing to remember is that a return to form is just around the corner, and two seasons is a small price to pay considering his highlight reel at Liverpool - imagine if he could play like that now! Once you've committed to Torres, you must ride out your decision whatever the costs.

Of course, once his two years are up, sign him again as he showed glimpses during his time that a return to world class form could just a few games away, even though those glimpses were against lower order sides in games which were safely won anyway. The final year of a contract is stressful for any player, so don't judge his form too harshly - drifting wide and disappearing for long periods in a match while turning over the ball when someone finally passes to him is actually a good effort considering his longstanding injuries and current lack of pace - he is after all, not the Torres of old. 

Give him another three year contract, and above all remember that he is a confidence player, so never drop him him as first choice striker. Don't ever forget that one amazing goal he scored, imagine if he did that more frequently, why he'd be the Torres of old, who as we all know, was unstoppable.

At the end of three years, adopt a wait-and-see approach. You can clearly see the intent is still there. Maybe the new coach can recapture the old magic. And let's not forget the shirt sales.

It is however, expected that these benefits do not count as work.

Expecting an MP to pay for staff out of their salary is ridiculous as it is, as they would end up being on less than the minimum wage.

What happens after a yes vote is very ill-defined. Pretty much all we have is the statement that ""independence will happen after the successful conclusion of the negotiations"".

My reading of this is that the rUK effectively has a veto over independence. If the negotiations stall (because of intransigence on either side) then the *status quo* will endure. There's almost certainly going to be a Commons vote on the rUK side of the agreement. But unless the negotiations are extremely straightforward, it's more likely calls for an English/Welsh/NI referendum will be irresistible. A House of Commons with Scottish MPs will simply be seen as not qualified to vote on the rUK side of the deal.

In that environment, there's simply no way any rUK negotiators could get away with giving every Scot a free £30,000 (or any other concession that would surely be rejected in a popular vote), even if they wanted to.

What then? Might Scotland declare UDI? That's possible, but then you'll be waving goodbye to any hope of joining any organisation where the UK has a veto. UN? EU? WTO? It's just unthinkable.

Lots of parts were interchangeable in the cars, so there are so many spares it's crazy.

The older cars will need a bit more TLC all over. I'd say a few tasks to get you into car maintenance would be: proper machine polish, full service, replacing worn our parts (with new, eBay and breakers yard as appropriate).

There's a wealth of knowledge online about doing this work, but it's always advisable to get a haynes to have for reference whilst you're doing the work.

I'd also (personally) steer away from getting a classic because they'll just generally be harder to find original parts for, and the MX5 came just in time for nice things like fuel injection, full double wish bones and full disc brakes (although an MGB has them too IIRC).",0,1410598352,null,0,false,0,ckh1ggu,t3_2g4vyb,t1_ckh1ggu,t1_ckg4exi,null,1427036277,1,false,CarTalkUK,t5_2w2lq,1

true,JXDB,,"Death, or Glory","Hiya, it's an old family recipe: 
Nana Brown’s Tomato Sauce.

Ingredients:
7lbs  ripe Tomatoes (the riper the better.)
3   large cooking Apples
6   large Onions
¼ lb  Salt (a bit less is fine)
2lb Sugar
26 fl oz Vinegar

For bouquet garni:
½ oz Black pepper corns
1oz Cloves
½ oz Chillies
½ oz All spice

Chop onions. 
Peel and chop apples.
Wash tomatoes.
Tie spices into a muslim bag
Boil all ingredients with sugar, salt and vinegar for 3 hours.  Allow to cool and bottle.

Hints.
1 ½ heaped teaspoons Pepper  = approx ½ oz
3 heaped teaspoons All Spice = approx ½ oz
Chillies vary in strength. Use more or less according to preference. I try to make differing strength batches each year. (Not feasible if you are only making one I know.) If you have trouble getting whole All Spice  or Cloves try the health food shop in Tring by Metcalfes. 

You can either peel the tomatoes (as my mother does)  before boiling in which case you can cut them up a bit. Or do as I do and put them in whole and stand over the pot for hours picking out the skins. I then put them in a sieve and force the juice et c thru with a spachelor for returning to the pot. (Skins to compost heap.)

The smaller the onions are chopped the better. Apples break down when boiled quite easily so slicing them is sufficient. Or both can be put thru a food processor thingy.

The old method was to strain the boiled mixture through a colander with a spachelor.
I get out my kitchen whiz thingy after the mix has been boiling for 2.5 hours and use that to blend everything (not the spices!) together. When it is a sauce consistency I boil it again for another 30 minutes.

While the sauce is boiling I wash the bottles and place them in a warm oven to make sure they are absolutely dry. Wet bottles cause exploding sauce! 

Leave mix to cool (overnight) and then bottle and label.
Leave on the side board or somewhere prominent for a suitable gloating period.
(The job is not completed until the gloating is done.)

La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga. I never said I referred to the Premier League as BPL or La Liga as Liga BBVA or anything like that, it's just I don't get stressed/angry about it. I just want to point out that it affects peoples lives in no meaningful way whatsoever, yet everyone on /r/soccer gets so mad about it anyway.

&gt;Sure, it's good dollars spent by the sponsor, but is that why you are watching?

Umm, what? This makes no sense. Nobody watches a league because it is sponsored by a brand. They watch it for the football.

&gt;Is that why you remember the name?

If you mean remember the Premier League is called the Premier League just because Barclays have their name in front of it, obviously no, lol.

Yes he's been probably the best player I've ever seen live at the Lane (although Van Der Vaart and Ginola were both unreal), yes he gave us some great moments eg. West Ham, Inter Milan, Lyon and Norwich and yes he was with us for 6 years. However just because he was the best player we've had doesn't make him a Tottenham legend, look at Suarez with Liverpool, would anyone call him a Liverpool legend with the likes of Gerrard and Carragher around? No I don't think so and you could argue Suarez had 3 equally good years to Bale. Which brings me on to my next point, I've seen a lot of people talk about Bale was there for 6 years, but for someone who supported Tottenham and Bale during this whole time, it really didn't feel like he was there for 6 years. He rode the bench for ages, was in the reserves and even nearly got sold to Birmingham. I understand this isn't his fault as he was young and still learning his trade, but Bale wasn't a first team player for 6 years like a Gerrard or Maldini. Also as I've just mentioned, those 6 years were his earlier days, can someone really be a club legend and leave at the age of 24?!? I think that is extremely premature. His best years are not going to be at Tottenham, they are going to be for that fascist, no personality club in Madrid (Sorry yeah I dislike Madrid). For me, to be a club legend your best years surely have to be at said club eg. Gerrard (Liverpool), Maldini (Milan), Drogba (Chelsea) etc. I just think because Tottenham recently haven't had a player like Bale we are very quick to say ""oh he was amazing, he's a legend."" I'm sorry but no for me, Defoe has an argument to be more of a legend to Tottenham than Bale IMO (despite the fact that Bale is 1000x better). Just to clarify I loved Bale and wish he would of stayed and become a legend but unfortunately that wasn't to be... COYS!

Of course, the wealthy dominate stock ownership too, and have sufficient liquid and other assets to avoid being forced to sell at the wrong part of the cycle.  However, during one of the cyclical property booms, it's almost trivial to be able make back a lifetime's taxes in a few years from assets in good locations - and those with sufficient resources have a pretty much free hand on this.  

As taxes are raised to build and improve infrastructure and services in shitty areas to ""regenerate"" them (as Detroit is beginning to see now), they're raised substantially from renters but ultimately benefit the property owners in the next round of gentrification and booming prices.

It's a cyclical thing, very much like the constriction and swallowing of prey by a python, slowly and relentlessly squeezing wealth upwards, despite the desperate struggles to escape this through progressive taxes, redistributive welfare and the like.

You think? Pretty much every NI nationalist is from an Irish catholic background.

Support for a United Ireland on the other hand is as I said pretty much entirely confined to the above mentioned Irish-Catholic ethnic group.

- First off I presume you're using a price comparison site?

- Now try adding your parents as named drivers in **different orders**, both parent if you can (you have to be main driver). This should bring it down.

- If you have a good job then 100% pay it in full - probably the easiest way to save the most money.

- For me having my Dad with a driving offence on his licence as a named driver actually brought the price down compared to putting him on without his offence listed - bizarre I know but it could be worth looking at this with when it comes to adding older people with experience to your insurance.

- Also, although it may not be convenient, the prices seem to change week by week and month by month as if there is certain times when insurance companies drop their prices either due to statistics or just quiet sales times but this could also be worth looking at.

- Also I almost forgot, look at multi car policies if you can with family members, 10% seems to be the average saving for multi car policies.

true,Dardanator,null,null,"How many times has Scotland entirely or largely voted for the tories and gotten Labour? The tories haven't always been unpopular in Scotland so I doubt this hasn't happened before. Why is it only a problem now?

Wales has consistently voted very strongly for Labour for far longer than Scotland has but I have never ever heard a single person here complain about getting tory/lib governments that ""we didn't vote for"" and using this as an argument for why they should have no jurisdiction in Wales. I think that part of this stems from the understanding that Wales is not one homogeneous entity and that there are parts of the country that do support the conservatives or other parties. The labour party vote is strongest in the traditional mining/industrial areas in the south wales valleys, and nobody acts as if these parts of wales, just because the majority of the population is concentrated here, have the right to ignore the opinions of other parts of Wales and decide the future of it.

The problem you describe isn't Westminster's fault or the Tories' fault, it's your own fault - you, the people of Scotland. I say this because we in Wales have engineered the exact same problem for ourselves. How? By us all stupidly taking tribal stances on political parties. There is no good reason at all why anyone should ever be blindly supportive or opposed to a political party regardless of who is currently leading it or what policies they pursue. In Scotland, where a lot of people are still fairly conservative, the image of the Tory party itself is in tatters, just because ""they're the tories"" and are instantly the bad guys. This started during the Thatcher years, but persists even now despite Thatcher being dead and most of her colleagues from those years having no part in politics. At the last election a lot of people in the UK who hold relatively centrist views shifted their support from Labour to the Conservatives, but this wasn't seen in Scotland - so I don't buy that this is to do with people in Scotland being more left wing when there are plenty of typically centre-left people in the rest of the UK, including in Wales, who had a more favourable opinion of the Tories at the last election than they usually would. 

If you and the rest of the electorate in Scotland abandoned this hatred and treated them like any other party, you wouldn't have this problem. Your local Tory candidates are Scots just like you, with more moderate centre-right views than the current party. If there were more Scottish tories then there would be a greater moderate influence on the party (look at the older tory governments that were more active in promoting welfare and social fairness, back when there were still many prominent scottish tories influencing them). If people in Scotland actually voted for the conservatives then the party would have a reason to care about Scotland. Likewise here in Wales, people vote for Labour by default just because it's the thing to do, nevermind that Labour has moved far away from the traditional left wing socialism that tends to be more popular in these parts. The consequence of this is that the conservative party don't care much about Wales or Scotland because, no matter what they do, they're not likely to get any more popular. The labour party don't care about Wales or Scotland because, no matter what they do, they are pretty much guaranteed a large number of votes.

It's the same with all the other neglected areas of the country, like the North of England - areas that traditionally vote for one party so are ignored by both of them. Not so much the case for areas that are die-hard conservative seats because they tend to be very well-off and sparsely populated anyway so their neglect isn't as apparent. Places like London get attention because they are full of marginal seats that decide the elections. Nothing will ever change if we're not willing to change.

The FPTP system doesn't help this at all, of course, but the source of the problem is ultimately us, the voters. Westminster is not as resistant to change as you might think, our generation has seen more political reform than any other. You were offered the Scottish parliament - ok, you might say you argued for it long enough, but Westminster also offered the welsh assembly and regional assemblies in England despite there being no demand beforehand. It's also offered local government reform and directly elected mayors in many cities and elected police and crime commissioners. These things haven't always proved popular, especially the latter, but they are things that have given us voters more say in how we are governed. They offered us AV, which is at least an improvement over FPTP, and it was us who declined it. Westminster has already offered lots of change and reform, there's no reason to think they wouldn't offer more if we demand it. It's not their fault if we decline it. Do you think Scotland is going to improve much after independence if you still keep thinking the problem is Westminster, who you can no longer blame stuff for? The problem is us, the voters, and our terrible, pessimistic and apathetic attitude toward politics. Unless you realise this and people start taking politics more seriously, an independent Scotland is just going to continue all of the problems we're currently seeing

But one of the best things about this referendum is how it's gotten so many people in Scotland engaged in politics. If Scotland votes yes and people keep their enthusiasm, that last sentence above might not mean anything. And even if scotland votes no but that enthusiasm continues, Scotland would be in a much better position to influence elections and change within the UK. That level of enthusiasm is what is needed across the UK for all of us to improve our country, I only hope that it spreads.",0,1410603137,null,0,false,0,ckh27g9,t3_2g766j,t1_ckh27g9,t1_ckgnxn1,null,1427035898,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,usrname42,eng-Cambridgeshire,Cambridgeshire,"The paragraph you quoted isn't the reason deflation is bad for the economy, the next paragraph is the explanation of that. The paragraph you quoted explains why inflation isn't bad and deflation isn't good - wages increase in line with prices. I'm not arguing that inflation makes people better off by making wages rise faster than prices, because that isn't true. But wages increase at the same rate as prices over the long term (note: this isn't true in a recession, but if we had long term deflation all that would happen in a recession is mass unemployment instead)

[This article](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/02/18/technological_progress_and_deflation.html) explains the problem with the technological argument about deflation. Technological progress should cause relative prices for some goods to fall as we develop new, cheaper ways of producing them, but there's no reason for it to cause a decrease in the general price level if you have a fiat currency. And if there was a decrease in the general price level, it wouldn't make anyone better off, because incomes would fall by the same amount.

I don't think people spend less when prices fall. It's important to think of this in terms of relative prices. The Law of Demand states that when relative prices for a good fall, demand for that good increases. When you have a sale, the relative price of the goods on sale has fallen, so demand for those goods will rise. When you have economy-wide deflation, relative prices for different goods do not change, so people don't buy any more of particular goods. However, deflation reduces the price of goods in the future relative to goods today, so people buy more of the goods in the future and fewer goods today, in keeping with the Law of Demand.

Your data include the five years 2008-13, meaning that 36% of the data comes from the deepest recession and slowest recovery in decades. Obviously, in such a period, wages won't rise by as much as prices; recessions make people poorer. It's not the price increases that are doing that, it's the recession. If you look only at wages, you miss the fact that unemployment in this recession has been less than the Great Depression, the 1980s recession, the early 1990s recession and most financial crises in the 19th century. A large part of that is the fact that stable inflation allows businesses to lower real wages rather than having to sack people. And if you look at longer term data that doesn't largely come from an unprecedented recession, wages do rise in line with prices, and in fact usually faster than prices because the economy is growing. See [this graph](http://i.imgur.com/IkDQBzz.png) of average earnings and prices since 1945, based on [Bank of England data](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/threecenturiesofdata.xls).

Austrian Business Cycle theory is largely rejected by almost all mainstream economists. This is not a political point, and it's not only Keynesians who disagree with it. [Bryan Caplan](http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/whyaust.htm) and [Tyler Cowen](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/01/the-return-of-h.html) are both right-wing Chicago-esque libertarians, and they both disagree with Austrian business cycle theory.

I can understand why parents like it, I can understand why we have it. It supposedly prevents differentiation via what you're wearing but from what I've seen it doesn't. Kids found other things - especially shoes, but also your school bag, how new your tie/blazer was etc.

It's also pretty damn expensive in my opinion. I think my blazer was £120, each time. You could definitely get 5 nice, ""fashionable"" shirts for that. Then there's the trousers and ties and school shirts. I don't think it's any cheaper than not having uniform to be honest.

Equally in 6th form (final 2 years) my school had a business smart dress code. We had to wear suits, but they were not the school blazers. Blue/black/grey suits and ties etc.
So there you get differentiation immediately. Suits are also incredibly expensive and even just having 2 (the minimum required imo) would cost at least £200 not including shirts or ties. Again you could easily get a fashionable 5 days worth of casual clothes with that.

Comfort wise it was fine. I tended to get hot in the summer but the school relaxed rules so we could take our ties off and roll our sleeves up.

I enjoyed wearing suits. It made me feel professional and it's something that I'd feel uncomfortable wearing casually if there were no uniform policies, but I do enjoy wearing.

However I didn't enjoy the restrictions on self expression, or the uniform when I was younger. No jewellery, no ""extreme"" hair styles, no visible tattoos, no visible piercings (for guys). I think we should have more freedom with those things. It's our body after all.

At times you guys drifted apart and moved on to other topic and came back to the old discussion.

- transfer discussion
- new signed player &amp; injury talk
- other football related talk

It also costs more to maintain the infrastructure already in place in Scotland, and to build new infrastructure there because there's greater distances involved.  If Scotland becomes independent they would be able to charge higher prices in Scotland to make up for it, currently they don't.

All of this price rises stuff isn't just random bullshit, businesses know that the cost of operating in Scotland is higher than the rest of the UK, they will pass those increases on to customers, there's simply no reason not to...

Whilst i'm sure snide comments were probably passed on occasion I don't think it ever caused a ruckus in any way. Most people had just matured and generally had bigger fish to try. We could leave when we wanted etc. so it's not like you had to sit and twiddle your thumbs and make gossip.

I remember having to go massively shopping before college though, because I didn't have many clothes. I didn't even own any jeans, and just like a few t-shirts. 

My school blazer was like, £30-£40? it's a big investment with everything, but comparatively not too bad. We used to have to wear them all the time in lower school though, which was stupid in the summer. By Y10/Y11 we didn't have to have them all the time, so it was at least nicer just to be able to wear a jumper. 

I liked uniform in that I would've definitely been bullied more without it, although it never did me many favours either. Kids like to pick on the ugly/fat kids, so er, yeah I think whatever you're wearing you end up with problems.

The only reason not to is if they have a *bad* credit rating, the mere absence of one is not a problem. You should close the account as soon as possible when you stop living together and it would generally be better to specifically ask for an account without an overdraft.

I have always strongly recommended a joint account to students finding joint accommodation as it increases transparency and fairness of all payments. It gives you a single account to manage that you all have access to, can set up a standing order to pay rent and direct debits for all bills - add up all the outgoings and divide by number of occupants for paying in each month. No-one I know who has done this has had arguments about bills.

If you keep everything seperate, you're still jointly liable but only individually responsible. Usually this is by taking bills each, leaving everyone with the hassle of chasing everyone else for money each month when they forget/pay by cash. I've known housemates to fall out over this.

Nothing surprises me, i am Irish, i know the history. They did not suffer nearly as bad, particularly in the 19th century. Catholics in the North were always substantially poorer than their protestant neighbours. 

This continued after independance. Ireland had one man one vote and no discrimation against religious minorities. In the UK (northern Ireland) catholics did not have the same rights until the latter part of the last century.

true,friendly-dropbear,capaldi,Capaldi,"I agree with the idea of a new showrunner, but I think Capaldi's Doctor has been spot on. Several of the classic Doctors felt ""cartoonish"" in a way too. He's an ancient alien with two hearts who stole a space ship and adventures across the galaxy. Hopes that this would be incredibly realistic may have been lost at the premise.

Capaldi, to me, feels the most like one of the classic Doctors of any so far (with Smith in a distant second), which is a nice change of pace. I'll agree that this season has been pretty ""eh,"" so far, with regards to the plot, but can't agree that the Doctor himself is any part of the problem.

Speaking of the plot, I think that's the real problem with Moffat. He simultaneously wants these epic endings and to have episodic stories, so he weaves this one element into every episode to tie together at the end. Which was clever the first time he did it, but is getting annoying.

Not to mention that I can't stand a lot of his female characters, and even those I do like, like Amy, eventually stop being particularly helpful in the various situations the Doctor always ends up in.

You are basically growing and magnifying your political problems, under the belief that somehow the scottish people will be more civilised or agreeable together than uk citizens and uk politics.

The government not representing your individual issues or values, is not a scottish only issue, and come independence you will see exactly how true that is.

Especially in a country that has routinely laid the responsibility for failure on westminster regardless, come independence there is no one to blame except other Scots, and if your political  culture has a long history of using a bogeyman to explain failure, it will seek a new one.

Yes but they're mainly in Glasgow and rougher parts of the West. Glasgow seems to be the only part of Scotland that still gives a shit about Catholics and protestants. Even then they're in an even shrinking minority. We're pretty secular up in Scotland.

true,chilari,eng-shropshire,Shropshire,"&gt; ""Boy racer"" cars? There is no such fucking thing. There are cars. Cars are cars.

Unfortunately, you're wrong on that. I see it every week, the same kinds of cars doing circuits of town with their added spoilers and whatever it is that makes them so fucking loud. And every time the cars have male drivers and passengers, all aged about 16-22. Everyone hates them and they make a racket driving down the road behind where my building is all Friday and Saturday evening, right up til midnight sometimes. They're part of the reason I won't go pick up a takeaway on my own on a Friday and Saturday night, because the road in my town with all the takeaway places on (well, four of them anyway - small town, so that's about half of them) is one of the ""circuit"" roads they go around. It's a narrow road, one way traffic, lots of pedestrians, two car parks off it at different points on the road, and on-street car parking too, but they still race down there. I call them ""circuit cunts"". Doesn't seem to be a way to stop them.

Anyway, back to the point. Insurance companies go by statistics. If you want one of those types of cars, you're just gonna have to suck it up. If you want cheaper car insurance, find a car that is considered lower risk. What's more important to you - looking cool or saving dosh?

&gt; In no other industry does this generalization occur based purely on statistics. I'm a person, not a fucking number.

The insurance industry across all types of insurance goes my statistics, because that's the best way they can work out. If your house is on a flood plain, you're gonna be paying more than I am, on a hill. If your house is really old, you're gonna be paying more than one that's pretty new, because older houses are more likely to have structural problems. If you live in a high crime area, guess what, that means you're statistically more likely to be a victim of crime, and thus more likely to make a claim on the basis of crime, and thus they charge more. Private health insurance is higher for people with existing conditions and for older people than for young and healthy people. It's higher for smokers and heavy drinkers than for non-smokers and teetotallers. That's how insurance works.",0,1410616789,null,0,1410617015,0,ckh51ud,t3_2g82kk,t1_ckh51ud,t1_ckh4idb,null,1427034212,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

On approach to the corner, slow down to just above your ideal corner speed. try to be around 70:30 front to back on the brakes (if that much force is even necessary.) 

as you approach the corner, release the front brake whilst 'dragging' the rear. 

now you may well be below your ideal corner speed. bring the clutch in, and build some revs. 2-3k rpm will do it. 

slip the clutch to keep yourself stable- the drive to the wheels is what keeps you stable, and control your speed with the back brake. 

As you exit the corner, slowly release the back brake and the clutch lever to get back up to a normal speed.

Clattenburg really is a piece of shit. Pellegrini really stuck the knife in as well, and right about time.

Clear foul on Aguero in the build up to Wilshere's equaliser, a push on Kompany as he attempts to head the ball away for Sanchez's subsequent goal.

And then a clear pen denied when Wilshere swiped the ball away with his arm.

Very unlucky not to win that game. Very hard done by.

David was phenomenal, Kompany beastly and won everything, Milner impressed in a central position.

Joe was his usual self though, poor, didn't make one notable save. Easily beaten by both goals.

Contrast that with Szczesny, who made a key save in the dying moments to stop Dzeko from bagging the winner.

That is, unless you are selling/assigning a conditional right, which is a grey area in my eyes as these usually are conditional rights which will arise eventually (perhaps not soon, but definitely will happen) whereas your bet is an event which is not certain, so in effect, you could be selling nothing. To safeguard yourself, you would have to explain the situation to the buyer and have them accept the conditions of your contract, that there will be no refund should the vote go against what was bet.

As /u/jajohu and (I think) /u/LordAnubis12 said, Resident is great. And if you like punky stuff then go have a look at Punker Bunker (34 Sydney Street, downstairs in Immediate Clothing). Go have a look in places like the Albert (pub near the station) as there's always lots of gigs upstairs there as well as posters and flyers for upcoming gigs around the place.

I do believe that it will all be quite bitter and unpleasant, and leave a lingering sense of distrust and betrayal (on both sides) between Scotland and England for years to come. The UK government won't want to concede any more than it absolutely has to, since it was Scotland's decision to leave, and the Scottish government... well they already threatened to renege on the debt. There's nowhere else to go.

The UK should have completely federalised before any discussion of splitting up. That way you would have much more time to organise a clean separation within the UK, without any uncertainty or high emotions, so that independence would only have an impact on defence and international relationships.

That was stressful. 

WBA are doing an awful job off the ball, but we are really struggling to move the ball out of deep areas. They have really put us under a lot of stress with their balls from wide, and everyone seems panicked- Baines more than anyone. 

I have never seen a Jags back line look so disorganised- he is not rallying the troops like he usually does... Makes me wonder if there is more to it than a bit of bad form. Odd one that. 

Going forward our lads have looked pretty damn dominating. We are moving the ball well once we have got it out of our own half, but our balls to Lukaku are a bit predictable and they are working a very good offside trap. 

Mirallas, McGeady and Lukaku all look sharp as hell on the ball, but are struggling to find final third areas off the ball, so there are no real killer passes on. We have tried to long ball to Lukaku from deep 3 or so times, all of which have been offside- we need to hold up the ball and allow the inside forwards to run into space, rather than our two touch style of keeping the ball moving- as that is just not working. 

---

I wouldn't mind seeing McGeady for Besic if things stay the same past the hour mark (Lukaku or Naismith out wide, and Besic moving deeper than Naismith is) as we need more support for playing out of defence- and I don't feel as though McGeady is offering enough support to Coleman, and that flank is pretty dead because of it. 

Other than that, the gaffer needs to just get them up for a war- as that is what is coming in the next 45 mins. We need to continue applying attacking pressure, and not let them grow into the game any further. We are the far better side, with far more goalscoring options, but WBA are getting more and more confident. If we carry on pressuring we are favourites to score next due to this quality... But if we sit back and counter... Well, see our other two games thus far this season. ",0,1410620350,null,0,false,0,ckh69ap,t3_2gacxq,t1_ckh69ap,t3_2gacxq,null,1427033494,4,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,4

There was a large Yes presence at the Royal Concert Hall but looking at the angle of the picture you would think that the whole of Buchanan Street was full of Yes campaigners which just isn't true - there were a couple hundred at most.

Incidentally the No campaigners who we spoke round the corner told us that the Police had actually moved them on because they couldn't guarantee their safety.

I also saw someone physically assault a guy walking in the street and going about his business - someone reached over, grabbed him and ripped the Yes badge off his tshirt.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;I see protectionism, mercantilism, closed borders, state control as the opposite to right wing politics.

I see that in every capitalist economy ever.  The ""that's not real capitalism"" defence has been spread rather thinly.

&gt;I don't really think that the BNP are far left. But they're more left wing than they are right wing and they are not right wing.

Well, you were actually responding to a post about the NF and the EDL rather than the BNP.  Nonetheless, even the BNP are really only floating populist policies to attempt to mobilise mass support, which is basically what the Nazis did.  Time enough for a night of the long knives and rounding up and imprisoning or killing left wingers, unionists, anarchists, labour organisers etc. later.  They're far right wing in their absolutist approach to hierarchies more than their laissez faire economics, but they are not anti-capitalist, they are not egalitarian and they have precisely zero class analysis.  Corporate profits rose and workers wages shrank considerably in fascist Germany and Italy, which is why the corporations helped fund the fascists to power in the first place.

On the other hand, I don't see most market fundamentalists, such as yourself, as necessarily fascists (there are a few who are, but it's not a particularly strong relationship).  Unfortunately, the ""free"" market and ""libertarian"" right hasn't helped its case by having several key representatives like Milton Friedman, Hayek, Mises and so on cosying up with fascist dictators (Pinochet, Salazar, Dolfuss, even Mussolini and Hitler) and praising their actions (or, at least, preferring them to democracy and the left).",0,1410621466,null,0,1410621688,0,ckh6osq,t3_2gabj0,t1_ckh6osq,t1_ckh5pgg,null,1427033267,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Oil revenue in government coffers pays for a whole host of services in the UK, including the ones that I, as a citizen in the North use.

My premise is quite a simple one: if Scotland leaves, and takes this revenue with it, I stand to lose out as a citizen. Do I get a say in this? No. Do I believe that living on one side of Hadrian's Wall makes me any more entitled to the benefits of exploiting this resource? No.

I've done my best not to say about how I feel about this place to my brother, I don't want him to be unhappy living here. I know that if I lived there I would not like it very much. From what I can see, your description is likely bang on. 

I've lived in the czech republic before for 3 years and I have to say that the standard of living there seems to be much higher than it is here and the czech republic isn't exactly the richest country in the world either. 

It's not the industrial look that gets to me. It's as you say, its this state of decay which is quite depressing for me to see. It's almost revolting and fills me with an awkward sort of disgust and loathing which I have never experienced before.

I worry for him enough as it is since he hasn't been a great student during highschool which is why he landed here in the first place. It's not like he really had much of a choice in the matter. I'm sure that if he would have had a choice then maybe he wouldnt have had to come here. I hope for his sake that he picks up the pace and gets decent grades so that he can get the fuck out of this place when the time comes. If I were him, I would stay within the protection of the uni and never leave. 

I hope to god that he meets the right friends as well and that he stays safe. God forbid that what you say about crime is really true. I hope he steers clear of drugs and shady groups. I hope he makes he right choices... I really do fear for him.

The person that my initial comment ( and the comments of others ) were directed at had made the statement that Ianto never appeared in dr.who and that this was not a Torchwood sub so any thing involving Ianto had no relevance here. 


I felt obligated to point out that he did make an appearance in two episodes. (  I couldn't remember of it was one or two but some one named both episodes) 


So a post about this character,  even if his time on the show was so limited is still relevant to this sub all be it only slightly.  



One could also argue that torchwood and any thing involving it is entirely relevant here because it was created with in that series and directly because of the doctors actions not to mention the fact that the "" Torchwood "" its self was featured in multiple episodes as an intricate part of the series. 


I how ever will not be the one to make that case as this discussion was ended when the names of the episodes were given.

In secondary school you had to wear a white blouse and black/grey trousers/skirt and your school jumper, and in summer you could wear a school polo shirt. Again, bland and comfortable (wait - boys had to wear ties with a white shirt, which I guess wasn't super comfortable. But they didn't have to wear ties with the summer polo shirt. Nobody wore blazers). I knew people who hated it and wanted to express their individuality and all that, which to an extent I understand but I also thought that if your individuality is so important to you that you can't bear not expressing it for a whole six hours a day - and the *only* way you can possibly express it is how you look, and you absolutely cannot do that within the bounds of the uniform - then maybe the school uniform isn't the problem.

Nit picking. But he just really doesn't inspire confidence at all - quite the opposite in fact.

Look at the contrast with Szchesney, makes a great safe in the dying moments to prevent us from winning the game.

Just have no confidence in Joe anymore.

[SPOILERS SEASON 7] While's it's cool that the Statue of Liberty is a Weeping Angel, how is that possible? It's man-made,  and everybody knows it. There's historical proof of it. So how'd it become an angel? What if someone was inside it when it started to move? Is angel-ness contagious? She's not even made of stone, she's made of copper and wood. So does that mean even metal can become a weeping angel? Wouldn't that be a better defense mechanism in the long run? But then what about the bronze bull and bear in NY? Are those angels too? Because that'd be horrifying!

And on the note of ""The Angel's Take Manhattan"", I don't very much appreciate the slapped together explanation he gave about not being able to visit the Ponds.

Where did he get the eggs? You know, in ""The Time of the Doctor"", at the end when he makes the fish sticks and custard? You need eggs for that? He's never mentioned having a refrigerator onboard the TARDIS. And don't give me that ""There's a room for everything in the TARDIS"". No. The man had barely enough energy to walk around one level of the TARDIS. Which in itself is another problem with the custard.

[SPOILERS SEASON 7] In ""The Day of the Doctor"", they both (10 and 11) talk about how sad they are that they burned the planet. But never in the history of Who do they say that. He's always mentioned that they were thrown into a Time-Lock. He never says they were burned. Ever. And trying to tell us something different during the episode frustrated me to no end.

Now onto the topic of the defense. We have looked very shaky. 5 goals conceded in 2 games is quite worrying. I think our defense may not be suited for our high press and possession attack. Slower defenders like JT would have a tough time playing that kind of system. I know it's early days and these two games could be an anomaly, but we need some youth back there. Zouma would bring the physical presence and speed, the guy who could make the last ditch tackle for us. That would mean Cahill would have to step up as the leader and keep Zouma in line, and I'm not sure Cahill is ready for that. Ivanovic is also losing markers on his wing. This was happening a lot in the first half, but he got his crap together in the second.

Anyways, it's early days and there is much to be worked on. Gotta sure up this defense, but I'm sure we'll get into a groove very soon. Besides, Swansea and Everton are no pushovers.

Also, something like:
""on -t'other side"" = ""on the other side""
