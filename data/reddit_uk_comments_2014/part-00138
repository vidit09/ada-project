AVB (love him or hate him) got crucified in the media both at Chelsea and with us. Some of the criticism was warranted, a great deal of it seemed fuelled because he wasn't named Harry and came from another country.

Sherwood by and large was spared the same treatment by the media. The supporters may have raked him over the coals for each an every mistake he made in the media or with the team on the pitch, but there certainly were a huge number of journos consistently writing articles lauding Sherwood as ""honest"" and ""refreshing"" and how he should be the long term solution for Spurs. If the players were unhappy it was because they were bitching and not as good as advertised, it never had anything to do with Sherwood. If the team lost it was because the squad ""capitulated"" not because the strategy was flawed and preparation was lacking.

Ever since Sherwood landed in the management role he was getting support from a huge number of the pundits and journos. Really only Hoddle in any way publicly criticized Sherwood (and it wasn't a huge criticism to be honest) and the result was Sherwood sniping back at him in the media and getting support from the usual suspects.

Heading into the inevitable sacking and this post sacking you see the usual suspects stepping forward again to talk up Tim and slam the club. Big Sam, Steve Bruce, Harry and Jamie Redknapp and others all have been quick to jump up to Tim's defence. None of these people batted an eye about AVB.

Gerrard/Lucas were basically tasked with impeding the opposition, track them and force the run to the flanks to allow our guys to reorganize, as opposed to the more direct engage and dispossess of a CDM.

He's too used to engaging the threat head on and if he miscalculates the defense is essentially compromised. With a back four the interplay between the attackers has to be really good or we'd just sweep it right up but with just two men left at the back neither can really push up to make that happen.

Evidence is useful. Evidence informs good policy.

How do you know what the ""man in the street"" means? Is it possible that ""man in the street"" has multiple potential definitions besides the one you've given?

Because that is how the politicians frame the debate, not only by what they say, but by the policies they implement when in office. 

Labour will, as a rule, over-spend in the name of looking after those who need it. 

Conservatives will, as a rule, over-correct, thus causing intense suffering for thousands of people. 

I am a lefty, I want to start from the principle that we, the 6th largest economy on earth, should look after those who need it. That homelessness and starvation should not be a part of our lives, and those who cannot help themselves (the disabled, the infirm, some elderly) should be taken care of by the rest of us. 

In my fantasy world left and right come together on this (and the NHS, and Defence and our role on the global stage) so it stops lurching from left to right with every (/every-other) election. The constant restructuring wastes an absolute fortune, and people get hurt in the process. Alas we don't live in my fantasy world, and I am unlikely to be allowed to become the UKs benevolent dictator. 

For every story of pikey bastards abusing the system and sitting around playing xbox all day, there is a story of a disabled person in need. I know two, personally. One carer for a very poorly young girl whose claim with the DLA has taken so long to process she lost her car... which is making the constant trips down to London for hospital appointments difficult, the other someone who suffers with lupus, a chronic condition which isn't always obvious, so good days and bad - she was assessed on a good day, ATOS declared her fit to work, and the appeal takes an age... and that's just the experience of a middle-class white bloke from the suburbs, where need is lower than most areas.

Personally I like the idea of a Basic Income with supplements for additional need... and I was persuaded by an article by the Adam Smith institute, with whom I don't think I have ever agreed about anything. It reduces the cost of redistribution, allows for a FAR simpler tax code, and you're always better off in work. Market principles then do things like capping rents (as they're not ""interfered with"" by housing benefits etc).

Both my sisters went to university and both of them had to move back home once their course was finished.

So they probably would have had to claim housing benefit themselves in order to pay for somewhere to live while they looked for jobs.


I understand the thought behind it but university is something of a transitory life stage. A lot of kids at uni go back home in the summer holidays, and move back permanently once their course is up.

We've already got the distraction and you kicking it into the long grass, even arguing that we should vote against constitution reform TWICE (surely creating even more uncertainty) before an In-Out referendum - so by your own argument it's more consistent to have one now, and soon, than not.

Add to that then the 'cast-iron guarantee' Dave Cameron's promise, which he's failed to deliver on as others have, which is now shifted to 2017 is covered in caveats and isn't even promised to be binding.  So a vote even then for out by Cameron's own meter won't mean the UK leaving.

As far as I know, and I don't know if anyone can confirm this for me, it's do do with how long the plant is allowed to bud before harvesting. The reason modern 'skunk' is so potent is because CBD is produced later in the grow, so for profits the plant is harvested earlier.

true,TheMemo,cnty-uk,Bristol,"&gt; But I do not think that simply giving up on trying to filter out the scroungers, as Labour did for so many years, is the answer.

You do realise that a lot of this mess started with Labour trying to filter out the scroungers, right? They were the ones that hired ATOS for the DWP. Labour are not, and have not been during their time, any better than the Conservatives in this regard.

&gt; I've said it before, and i'll say it again. This system needs looking at and fixing.

*It cannot be fixed* in the way you are saying. It simply cannot, it is mathematically impossible and morally irresponsible. People have been trying to do the same thing as you suggest for *decades* and they still fail, because it's not in any way a realistic expectation. No government has been throwing money at scroungers 'just because' - they have done so because efficacy is more important than stopping wastage, just as protecting the innocent is more important than punishing the guilty in the justice system. The more you try to prevent unauthorised use of the system, the more difficult you make it for legitimate claimants, and the more poverty rises. This is the way things are. This is how it works. You cannot 'fix' it. You cannot 'overhaul' it. All you can do is make minor changes, as you would to a plane engine once it's up in the air. Too many 'fixes' and the thing drops out of the fuselage and we're all heading for the ground, which is pretty close to where we are at now. And, yes, the women, children and vulnerable have already been pushed out of the plane first without a parachute.

There is simply no way of seriously effecting change in a system that people rely on *weekly* without going to the expense of creating a parallel system that takes on the responsibilities piecemeal. And, in fact, that has been tried before. And it was an expensive failure, and a reason why we now have a fractured welfare system and companies like ATOS can take over significant aspects. Forget about 'too big to fail,' welfare and pensions are simply 'too big to change' and even 'too big to understand.'

The only conceivable overhaul that wouldn't put the most vulnerable at risk would be Guaranteed Basic Income, and that has a whole host of knock-on effects for society that we simply are not prepared for. At least with GBI, it would be a matter of making Tax Credits the prime money distributor, that is a system that could conceivably take over from the disparate welfare systems.",0,1400168052,null,0,false,0,chiobjd,t3_25m0ft,t1_chiobjd,t1_chikeu3,null,1433808506,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

In the scenario you imagine, are people allowed to grow their own plants at home? 

If not, who controls the supply of this drug, is it private companies? Why would they not supply the strongest products possible for the lowest cost of production, just as a drug dealer would? 

If you suggest limiting the strength of cannabis that would be made available, would that not just create a new illegal drugs trade, for the stronger drug, which could be competitively priced as you would not be paying tax on it.

However, I will try to give you some advice. 

Firstly, what they are doing is not 'illegal' as they aren't breaking any laws.  This is purely a breach of your tenancy agreement.   But I'm sure there are no terms in your agreement what would happen if they are in breach, there however probably is a clause that if you are found in breach that they can terminate the tenancy with minimal notice. 

Okay here's the thing, I don't think there's a case to claim anything, because the costs of the legal hassle clearly outweighs the actual claim you might have against them .

What I reckon you should do is either when you receive notice that they are coming is to (1) make it so messy that no one would ever want to rent it out or (2) add additional locks to your place (aslong as it's not in breach of your agreement) and lock them out. If they complain, just say that if they give 24 hours notice it wouldn't be locked as you'd remember to unlock it.

If i remember correctly there take on him was essentially that most people who compared him to Lukaku or Benteke hadn't seen enough of him.

If it's sold at reasonable prices then criminals will have a huge loss in sales. We could also tax weed which is another reason on why it should be legal.

Also it can help people who have mental illnesses (Not all some find it makes things worse others say it makes it better) but it also helps with pain relief and helps calm you.

I agree, and thats how most top sides work, but most top sides have an infinite budget or run in the red. FSG dont like it that way. I can see BR getting rid of Agger purely from a footballing POV. I dont believe he has much confidence in him, thats why he isnt playing him much. 

Now, if youre BR would you rather a 9m player on the bench who you think will work or go with a 15m player you think wont work? Remember that BR loves nothing more than getting a player who he believes he can mould into something he likes. We need someone at the back who commands respect and has a fucking powerful voice...like Carragher or Hyypia. If JC had stayed another year we would have won the league.

Perhaps you're right about molding a player--that's a fair point. I would find it hard to take if Agger was sold for any reason other than him wanting to leave.

He did so without complaint and he was a major reason we won the league that year.

Anelka really showed what a professional he was for us. Until AVB there was hardly a hint of controversy with what he did for the club. It bothered me that since then, certain players (like Sturridge) complained so vocally about not getting to play centrally, when Anelka did so with aplomb and without complaint after being the league's top scorer the season before. 

AVB forced him out in a really unbecoming, unprofessional way. It was clear that things weren't working and that it would be best if he left in the January transfer window, but it was the pithiness of making him park elsewhere, train with the youth, and use a separate  changing room that gives some insight into why AVB seemed to be so unpopular with the established, veteran members of the squad.",0,1400171569,null,0,1400181664,0,chiq0u7,t3_25mnv1,t1_chiq0u7,t1_chiold4,null,1433809307,9,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,9

Again there is a scary drop in conviction rate from 2012 to 2013, but in context it is fairly meaningless. For example, a drop of 4% in conviction rate for rape of a male comes from one fewer conviction.

I know that, what does it have to do with what I said? I was saying Alcohol is more potent, which it is.

&gt;LSD cannot kill you, but that's one of the most potent drugs around.

We're talking about weed &amp; alcohol though, and the fact is you can overdose on one and not the other: so the most potent one is clearly Alcohol, the killer. Not only that but it drops your inhibitions way more than weed. Any weekend in Britain is full of louts swarming streets causing alcohol fuelled violence: there is no weed alternative to that. You don't see people going around causing fights and glassing each other after a joint. Which one is more potent? Tell me. 

Also let me correct you, as tripping is not what people do when they smoke weed. If you're an inexperienced user then sure, you can freak out and have a very bad time. Not denying that, it's the same as any other drug and people should respect it like you said. However, on the other hand, we have alcohol. Countless times as a youth I experienced kids who didn't know their limits. People can shit themselves, vomit all over &amp; regularly need stomach pumps. On weekends our hospitals are full of drunks, not stoners. So again, which is more potent?

He's lost a lot of his physical prowess but Gerrard's done a good job of adapting there's little to suggest Lucas can't be coached into it as well.

 You make a very valid point about time being a factor. If we are gearing up for another title chase we're probably not going to be able to afford him the luxury of time to learn the new role. That's why he probably will leave if a decent offer comes. However I don't think he'll be pushed out either.

My main reasoning for him staying is he can be a very useful player in the 4-5-1 (which is essentially the same minus the full back as wingers) we deployed earlier in the season. It got us a few 1-0 wins. Cup games are going to increase the work-load significantly and I don't see Gerrard (he's still got it but do we really want to over-stretch him) and Henderson (surely he can't be his busy self for 100+ minutes a week) playing all those extra minutes. That leaves our midfield a bit bare in the box-to-box and deep-CDM role.

The 4-5-1 is not glamorous but its fairly solid at the back and I think we need that option. And while another shiny new CDM might just as well solve that problem for us, it could still be a mistake to get rid of Lucas right away.

Since they're going to be inherently smaller 'companies', they're going to have larger overheads, so to fight a price war against bigger businesses would be futile. The big business would always win because their overheads would be lower than that of a small-time drug dealing company. It just wouldn't make a lot of sense for the smaller dealer to try to undercut the big business.

To make this a reality, it's all in the detail. The amount of duty on weed versus the hit on profits caused by the extended grow time. This would have to be thrashed out by the economists - I don't really have the head for these kind of things.

Really, however, after the first week, just as like the first week in any job, you find habit and repetition really speeds things up.

The sad thing is UJM is virtually mandatory, yet it doesn't have the functionality to even add a covering letter to an application, you've got to go 'around' the damn system to sneak one in.  Yet they're still convinced it's some holy grail to getting a job, to be using it, because they refuse to admit it's a big waste of money designed to waste jobseeker's time, which could be better spent on almost any other side, but then they couldn't track their activities.

To show how one sided it is, you can't even flag adverts as suspected 'spam' or 'fraudulent'.  You can only flag a job as unsuitable if you give a reason such as 'unqualified' 'too far away' 'doesn't pay enough' and the like, which they'll undoubted use against you later.

EDIT: It also encourages people to apply for jobs they don't want or can't do, just to placate the targets of the Jobcentre, this helps no-one, certainly not the employers, who are now having to sift thru hundreds of CVs instead of maybe a dozen.

Salmond's position is that the Bank of England (Control over the pound) is a shared asset and if there was a YES vote it should/would be split along the same dividing line all other shared assets are split (8% ish). *Meaning* that the BoE would not be solely rUK's to make decisions with.

*As far as I know* Osborne hasn't rebuked that specific point, he hasn't claimed that the BoE isn't an asset, just that when iScotland's 8% of BoE asks for currency union to be the policy it will be rejected every time, it's not something he's going to consider.

Salmond says it's a bluff, I don't agree with that *but* I do think that everything can change in negotiations and that he has Trident, Strategic Defence, Energy and Corporation Tax as bargaining chips. It's just a matter of whether rUK thinks any of them are important enough to give up currency union for (or if Salmond thinks the opposite, I guess). 

To take it to the marriage shared bank account, Salmond thinks Osborne can stamp his feet all he wants about not wanting to continue sharing the account but he can't just assume ownership of Salmond's part of the account so he *has* to negotiate some kind of settlement one way or t'other. Like the proposed deal for established database systems, iScotland can't continue using them but it helped pay for them so a possible settlement would be literally buying out the 8% in cash.

Personally I think a currency union is a bit of stupid idea, yes it would be the most stable option for us but it's a shit load of bureaucracy for a small slice of influence that will keep us tied to Westminster's handling of the economy, stunting our diversion.",1,1400175026,null,0,1400175485,0,chirq9u,t3_25mdhj,t1_chirq9u,t3_25mdhj,null,1433810112,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Ian Duncan Smith needs to get his finger out of his arse and get it sorted.

Throwing more money at the problem won't solve anything. What he is currently doing is blaming people for his inability to do his job, like a bad manager would blame his employees for his lack of management skills. It doesn't matter what people are doing, his job is to get them in work where possible, at minimal cost to the taxpayer, instead he has paid out billions to ineffective contractors and set up inefficient systems that end up costing more than just giving people the benefits to begin with, and to top it off we have a few thousand new homeless people sleeping rough across the UK as a direct result of his poor decisions.

Well, once they finish education seems like the ideal place :) I don't disagree with any of your other points and I can see the wisdom in downsizing people who genuinely no longer have someone occupying a room - but since a teenager at uni is almost certainly going to be coming home in the majority of cases and probably won't be able to leave again till they find work (which is no longer guaranteed regardless of getting a degree), it makes no sense to try and get their families to downsize when the chances are, they're going to need that space during christmas and summer holidays and then permanently when their course ends.

Contrary to popular belief it's not illegal to give a ""bad reference"" so long as what they say is factually accurate, which means that they would be on a sound footing to tell a prospective employer that you broke your contract, walked off site and left them in the lurch with no notice.

So long as they can prove any consequential losses that arise as a result of that breach of contract, they can also take you to court to recover said losses. If your employer had to hire a contractor or engage a temping agency to cover your post whilst they recruited your replacement, they could take you to court to recover that additional expense.

In nearly all cases they wouldn't take you to court, but I'd still not want a future employer told that I breached my contract as that's hardly going to fill them with confidence about me.

To retain stable job prospects in the tech industry requires more hard work, time and dedication than almost any other industry, and certainly more hard work than comparable or higher-paying jobs.

true,Knowingspy,null,null,"I think it was due to the formation IMO. 

If you play a ""3"" striker attack in a 4-3-3, inevitably one of the strikers will play in the centre (main goal scorer as he would be expected to meet crosses etc) and two out wide (facilitators/ inverted wingers) - which, with Torres being the golden boy as a result of his heightened price tag, it had to be him in the middle. A similar situation occurred at Newcastle United, with Demba Ba and Papiss Cisse jostling for the central spot in a 4-3-3, one's form suffered when the other was prioritized, you can see it recently with Remy outshining Cisse.

As much as any centre forward will attest to the fact, they have to be selfish for them to be consistent goal-scorers and therefore, if Drogba plays wide he will prioritize his chance at scoring over the man in the middle, i.e. Torres. This was largely a main factor in the failure to keep Sturridge, due to AVB's insistence to play a trigger happy shooter on the wide right, thus being a detriment to any striker hoping for a pass through on goal and to Daniel for being (in his mind) unjustly shackled. 

Anelka did play wide in the past but in the title winning season (09/10) we had Kalou and Malouda offering a selfless option to balance out any egos up front which did help smooth things over. 

In future seasons when Torres played in a 4-3-3, we often saw him trying to play as an auxiliary winger - this was due to the fact that his teammates weren't geared to giving him the ball early enough which forced him to move around, thus reducing the limited threat he already had and if Drogba played, he would be chosen to batter the opposing defenses in the middle instead of the aforementioned strikers. 

Quite simply, we had three strikers, all of whom wanted to score but none were accustomed to be facilitators in the wide areas. Torres had an unfortunate cocktail of underconfidence, poor form and recovering from injury which brushed many strikers (including Anelka) up the wrong way for being chosen over them for the prized spot up front. In the end, the beast that is Drogba won out and left Torres playing as an (at times frequent) right midfielder or bench-warmer.",0,1400177453,null,0,1400381923,0,chisyed,t3_25mnv1,t1_chisyed,t3_25mnv1,null,1433810733,21,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,21

The majority of offences being ""common assault"" and ""reckless conduct"" incidents. The data doesn't split down to distinguise between air pistols and air rifles though.

One of the serious problems with the 12ft exemption from the requirement to hold a FAC for an airgun is that it is trivial to acquire a sub 12ftlb airgun and then uprate by double or more muzzle energy with a more powerful spring, or even just the turn of a screw in  precharged pneumatic. 

There's loads of nutty things about firearms law in the UK, the distinction in law between shotguns of low and high capacity, long and short rifled-barrelled firearms, low and high powered airguns, long and short airguns, etc.  

The way I see it is that it's about people not firearms. You are either fit or not to own a firearm, if you have a legitimate purpose for any type of firearms at all you should be entitled to acquire them but have a safe place to store and shoot them and be held fully accountable for any harm that comes from them.

I'm going to try put them in some order of genre:

Young the Giant - by far the slowest and softest of bands I'll suggest, here's them on a beach http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wjlcVY5XAg

Arkells - Jackson Square; It's a good album, here's [Oh the Boss is Coming](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MabuNr-wQkk)

Brand New - The Devil and God are Raging Inside me; I've listened to this album too many times, at first listen it is easy to under appreciate these guys. Here's [Millstone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHZaT3Zrqhk) off the album.

Muse is probably right up your alley, here's [Supermassive Black Holes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pta-gf6JaHQ) by them.

Here's a new UK band Napoleon's EP - [What We See](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpt7E4Ylmwk). I don't know what exact genre they fall under but I really like it.

Somewhat along the same vein, here's a song by [Being as an Ocean](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hS-JKGA3H_o), they have a metal singer and a normal singer and melodic guitar rhythms, you'll probably hate it.

If you're looking for other bands similar to ones you already you know like, you should try a site like http://audiomap.tuneglue.net/. You type in a starting band and then hit expand and shows you 6 similar bands to them, then you can expand these as well, and so on and so forth.

I was on an intensive program for long term claimants, which initially sounded like a brilliant idea to help those who are struggling to get back into work. Except, I wasn't a long term claimant. I had been on Job Seekers for just a couple of months before University and apparently the time I was attending there counted just the same as being on Job Seekers, labelling me a long-term claimant. The program itself turned out to be nothing more than a brilliant show of ""These people are a pain and making us look bad, get them to quit"" too, resulting in having to prove 50 hours per week of Job Searching. The key there is prove, too. Most of what I did simply didn't count. It ended up harming my Job Search, making it more difficult to get back into work. 

It all ended for me when I was on a course that they demanded I take. It was 45 minutes on the train away, and I used most of my Job Seekers on travel to get there for the 6 Weeks that it ran (with the assurance I would be compensated afterwards, so long as I kept my tickets). On the final day of the course, it conflicted with my weekly sign-on so I phoned the Job Center to notify them. After being assured it was fine and to just bring double the proof to my next sign-in, you can imagine my shock when I turned up next sign-on and found out I had been kicked off. Out 6-weeks of train fares too.

This is where I would normally put a happy ending, that being kicked off meant I had the time to find a job and I live a comfortable life now. Unfortunately, like most of the people that get unfairly dismissed from Job Seekers, there is no happy ending here. But I don't blame the people themselves, even after all they have done to me.

They are regularly recruiting, true, because it is one of many types of jobs that a lot of people will see as temporary - in part because it doesn't pay all that great and comes with unpredictable hours in many cases, and because **supply** of people who are willing to take the jobs is high enough that it is cheaper for them to continuously recruit more drivers than pay their drivers sufficiently more to retain them for longer.

A complete overhaul of defense is not what we need.

I think our CBs have suffered because of our FBs.

We get a world class RB. I think Johnson is great, but we need better defending FBs, we don't need them to contribute to offense that much, he's just not suited to the team.

Enrique will be perfect for us at LB, and I just haven't seen anyone worth spending money on when we have Enrique, assuming he plays like he used to.

With Enrique, and a new RB, our CBs will be great.

Agger does not need to go, people seem to dislike him, but I think he just suffers the most when playing with bad FBs.

Skrtel, Agger, and Sakho as our top 3 choices is fucking perfect. Ideally Ilori will be good enough to be 4th choice, maybe sharing time with Kolo. I would be okay with that. Someone else that is happy being 4th choice is okay too.

A really young LB with huge potential would be nice as 3rd choice LB after Flanagan, who would cover both left and right. Ideally I'd keep Johnson as back up for both spots too, but his wages are too high to be a backup.

Lucas can stay as mostly a backup to Gerrard, but if we can get a young guy that can play DM, but is also decent at shooting, I would prefer it, since Lucas is not good filling in at CM.

Our offense is why we are second, and adding more to it would be great. Players that fit the system and aren't overpriced.

RB or a new creative attacker should be our biggest purchase.",0,1400181927,null,0,1400194720,0,chiv6r5,t3_25m37k,t1_chiv6r5,t3_25m37k,null,1433811807,31,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,31

We misunderstand paedophilia in the same way we misunderstood homosexuality just a few decades ago.

I think in the decades to come we'll realise that we were just vilifying people who happened to be wired differently in the brain.

But we should at least stop making monsters of them. It's not helpful. It sends them underground, and sometimes they end up doing something horrible. Whether that be suicide, or acting out on their urges. 

We should be pitying these people, not vilifying them.

Imagine if you could never have sex with the people you're attracted to. It'd be the worst. It sounds like a very shit existence.

Can didn't get a lot of playing time even with winning the league quite early and he was linked to a loan spell to quite a few clubs until Bayern announced out of nowhere that Can will get sold. 

The official press release about his Transfer said that Bayern has the option to buy him back anytime. Rummnigge got quoted to saying that Emre Can is one of Germany's biggest talents and that Bayern wants to ensure that Can gets enough playing time in his development like Kroos, Lahm and Alaba before him. 

During Bayern's annual General meeting last year, Rummenigge repeated that Emre can be brought back under standing ovations of the members. 
So while I can't be sure what the intern opinion about Can was the official statements always pointed out what a huge talent he is and that he is involved in the future plans of Bayern.

I also wonder about the whole DoF in England. It has never worked at any of the major clubs and it has never shown to work for us. Yet we keep trying it. There is something about the apocryphal Einstein quote about insanity to the way we keep doing this.

I suspect the last thing Levy wants to do is paint himself into a corner with another Redknapp type manager.

That's....an interesting way of looking at things. You're right that the poor use more services than they pay for, but given that the rich pay for those services via taxation I'm not sure I see the point of contention on that front.

&gt;So yes, they would die, because on minimum wage they'd be massively in debt on their tax bill alone.

If you want to get rid of the state, sure. Unless you're approaching this from a anarcho-capitalist perspective of ""lets get rid of government"", then your argument seems...oddly focussed.

&gt;The thing we can thank some of the rich for is subsidising industries that cannot pay their workers enough, but to say it's the workers that are being subsidised is not at all fair.

Call it unfair if you like but it's completely accurate. Those who earn lots contribute lots, and those who earn little cost lots.

More than you think. Numerous times I've heard the phrase ""I wouldn't normally vote Conservative, but I really like him/her"". Such voters have likely decided many seats across the country, and that needs to be respected as it's a sign of a healthy democracy.

But more importantly, there's a lot of people who try to communicate with their representatives. To make it worse, if someone wants to lobby an MEP to change something in Europe, they won't call a UKIP or BNP MEP, so the communications is even further concentrated on other MEPs. The nature of the lists also tends to funnel people into contacting MEPs at the top of their respective party lists instead of lower down.

A few years ago I remember watching a documentary (channel 4 probably) about pedophiles in a Scandinavian country. 

They had admitted their problem and approached the government for help, and the government did what it could (though there was still a lot of misunderstanding)

It became abundantly clear that these particular people where aware of their problem and where doing their best to do the right thing. I believe (and my memory is sketchy) that some actually opted for chemical castration.

This is when it dawned on me that potentially there is another side to this.

I have a degree of sympathy now. I feel in this country we have stigmatized pedophiles to such a degree that anyone who might call out for help would essentially be ostracized and attached in every way imaginable.

What do you mean if you get rid of others? I truly don't understand what you're attempting to get at with this line of argument.

&gt;So no, you're not the ones making that possible, the ones below you doing all of the work are.

Doing all of the work are they? Well fuck, I'll just stop working my 80 hours work then, I never realised they were doing everything for me!

My skills are more valuable than 90% of the people in this country, as such I get paid better than 90% of the people in this country. My labour is worth £XYZ around the world because its not an artificially inflated number, it's worth what it is. Some people don't have skills beyond the luck of British citizenship and a basic grasp of English. Their labour is remunerated at £6.31 in the UK, or £0.46 in Nigeria, because in actuality their labour is worth very, very little, and its only because government's and nations have decided that they'd rather not have utterly impoverished people living in their nations that these people aren't living in shacks and eating gruel twice a day.

&gt;It was a hypothetical situation, to try and show that it's not clear cut.

What's not clear cut? Do we rely on society to function as a society? Well yes of course we do. If half the nations employees suddenly disappeared of the face of the planet would we all be screwed? Well yes of course we would, but so what? That doesn't negate the value a given employee brings to the table in our current situation.

&gt;I also don't think that just because someone isn't in a high paying job, doesn't mean that they're not capable of performing well in that position.

This is true, but in general economic value tends to correlate with salary.

The rich get a lot of power because they are contributing most of the money, and there is an attitude that they are doing everyone a favour and those pesky poor people should be thankful for whatever breadcrumbs they are allowed to have.

In fact, these people are poor because of a policy decision, that it is better to subsidise them than lose a cheap labour force that can compete on the international stage. Effectively companies are allowed to pay incredible low wages (compared to the total cost of keeping a person alive here with a reasonable standard of living) to help the economy (something everyone benefits from, including the rich).

When you look at it that way we should all be thankful for the poor putting up with it while we try to grow the economy, instead they are often seen as the problem.

&gt; How do you figure that?

Because they are benefiting from cheap labour that would not be available if the workers were not being subsidied by the government. They are effectively costing the country money by not paying enough to cover the cost of their workers to the country.

She was working 70-80 hour weeks to work on the rotas because they expected her to take on that responsibility in addition to her regular day to day tasks. This required lots of unpaid overtime, because basically if she didn't get it done, people the following day would go without care. Add that to always being on call with no standby pay and having practically no days off for 3 months (When she did have a day off, they would call her in anyway). In addition to taking a 25% pay cut on two occasions in the last 6 years (Leaving her on ~£17k pa), it just wasn't worth it for her anymore for all the stress she had to put up with, she hit her breaking point and handed her notice in. I heard three of her colleagues did the same as they knew the added workload would simply be passed over to them.

Because of cuts in the care contracts given to private companies, there is a push for improved service at reduced cost. This means overworking and underpaying staff. If I recall, the company gets a fixed rate of something like £7-8 for a standard 30 minute care visit (Which may include 20-30 minutes of travel), which has to cover the staff wages, travel/fuel costs, as well as all business overheads and non-care staff.  It doesn't take a genius to work out that this doesn't add up.

The bottom line is the councils aren't paying enough for the private companies to fulfill the contracts. The companies are being squeezed, stuck between a rock and a hard place. The staff are having to take pay cuts, do unpaid overtime and contribute to their own travel expenses just to stay in a job, and there is a massive guilt trip if they dare to push for better pay and conditions because vulnerable people rely on them.",0,1400185951,null,0,false,0,chix7qj,t3_25m1us,t1_chix7qj,t3_25m1us,null,1433812762,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The British government granted Justice Minister Tzipi Livni temporary diplomatic status obstructing any attempt to arrest her during her visit to London this week, the Guardian reported on Tuesday. Livni's office confirmed the report.

The Guardian states that the British Foreign Office will grant Livni, who will leave to London Wednesday evening to meet with her British counterpart William Hague, a ""special mission"" status – effectively giving her a temporary diplomatic immunity from being legally arrested or prosecuted.

The British Foreign Office told the Guardian that Livni's trip satisfies all ""essential elements"" to qualify as a ""special mission"" and that in order to avoid ""any doubt on the matter, [the office] has confirmed consent to the visit as a special mission.""

This decision comes after numerous attempts have been made to issue a warrant for Livni's arrest on account of her alleged involvement in the perpetration of war crimes. The move was led by lawyers from Hickman and Rose, who represent the relatives of a Palestinian killed during the bombing of a Hamas police base on the first day of Israel's operation ""Cast Lead"" in December 2008.

With the help of the Gaza-based Palestinian Center for Human Rights, the London law firm asked the Director of Public Prosecution to order Livni's arrest and to open criminal action against her.

The law on ""universal jurisdiction"" made it possible to prosecute foreign officials, while on British soil, for violation of international law. This placed senior Israelis who wished to visit the United Kingdom in risk of being arrested. In 2009 the law was changed to encumber the issuing of arrest warrants for Israeli officials by demanding that any such request be authorized by the DDP.

The law firm filed the request late in April, but on Monday the DDP was informed that Livni has received diplomatic immunity from the British Foreign Office and was therefore safe from having legal procedures opened against her. During a 2011 visit to the United Kingdom, Livni had also received a ""special mission"" status, while pro-Palestinian activists motioned to have her arrested.",0,1400186065,null,0,false,0,chix9sc,t3_25mifm,t1_chix9sc,t1_chisazy,null,1433812790,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Aye, and I'm just saying that even adding together that half of the country, it's not saying a huge amount. What does the average person have in that bracket? No house, maybe a cheap car, no savings, a fair amount of debt, generally no pension. Not a whole lot really.

true,whole_scottish_milk,null,null,"&gt; Bearing in mind you can't overdose with it, it is possible to smoke almost pure THC in the form of 'shake' or 'skuff

Kief from your grinder is not ""pure THC"", that is a myth (I assume you're talking about the dust in the bottom of your grinder when you say ""shake""), it has a higher THC content than regular bud (which is between about 12% average and 20% in very strong, well grown plants, up to about 25% in extremely strong strains grown by professionals, some claim 30% and above but I would be skeptical). The kief still has all the same ingredients as regular bud but without the added plant material to bulk it out, and with the amount of time required to save a noticeable amount, it's not something that a new user is likely to experience during his first smoke. Kief is basically about the same content-wise as low grade hashish (not quite as low grade as council soapbar hash, but pretty low grade nonetheless) so about 30-40% THC content, maybe up to 50-60% if you have very fine mesh in your grinder, and since you would rarely ever use the same weight of kief or hashish in one smoking session as you would with bud, it's not a fair comparison. It's like whiskey and beer, you drink one by the pint and one by the shot. Also remember there are upwards of 400 chemicals all interacting with each other when the plant is ingested (through the gasses from smoking or from digestion) so THC is not the be all and end all of what is going on in the cannabis plant, there are many different chemicals all affecting your high, some in very obvious ways and some in more subtle ways.

If you want an example of a cannabis extract which I would call ""potent"", it would be cannabis oil (I believe the kids are calling it ""dabs"" these days). One hit is like a 5 hour session all at once, and it will destroy any veteran smoker. Snoop Dogg himself would be questioning his smoking habits after a bong hit of some cannabis oil. I personally avoid the stuff as getting absolutely trashed is not why I smoke cannabis.

I smokedalottafuckinweed (for science), and while there's a noticeable difference, I can still function and have no problem standing near my 2 story window, I would go out and stand next to traffic and operate some heavy machinery but it's quiet outside and I don't have any spare JCBs lying around.

Well done greens, you've just effectively destroyed the British economy, the only thing going for them here is they managed to find a brand new way of doing so. 

There is also the problem of how are they going to pay for these changes? They say they're going to get rid of austerity measures and cuts but fail to mention that pretty much the only way to do this is increase taxes or make cuts elsewhere such as defence (which I don't actually have a problem with) and education and health (which I do). They are also far to narrow minded to have any power, our government needs politicians who can see the big picture, who will not invest everything in green energy at the expense of everything else but will balance the countries needs. 

They have also allowed uncontrolled fare increases in Brighton (despite increasing profits by the bus company) and Caroline Lucas has essentially stated that she isn't capable of effecting change in parliament so she went on a stupid, misinformed protest instead and got herself arrested. Not behavior which exactly fills me with confidence in her party.   ",0,1400187092,null,0,false,0,chixs4k,t3_25m8xu,t1_chixs4k,t1_chix47b,null,1433813030,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;As it proved with strong unions, if workers group together, they can demand better pay and conditions - which shows where the power really is, and why governments hate high levels of employment.

Sure, but unions only have the power they have because government's make it illegal to fire them. Take away that right and you'd very quickly find most striking workers fired and replaced by more compliant workers who, chances are, could do the job just as well.

Value of the low paid is entirely artificially inflated by the government.

&gt;My point is that, right now that may be true - your skills are obviously in demand, and are are - but surely you're not saying you're better than 90% of people?

Of course not, I'm saying my labour is worth more. The value of my time does not make me a ""better"" or ""worse"" person than anyone else, nor should it make me more hated or more liked. It just is.

&gt; With better education, and choices in subjects studied/paths chosen, wouldn't more people be able to achieve the same skills?

No-one in this country had opportunities any different from me besides those who were born a bit thick.

&gt;On top of this, I'd like to ask if you think someone that has done their absolute best in life, and could not have taken more opportunities than they have, but are just not as intelligent as someone on a higher wage, should be entitled to that higher wage too?

No. Entitlement is a concept that does not exist in wage value. You're either worth X or you're not worth X, whether a person *deserves* to earn X just isn't even a valid concept. Life isn't fair, and that's the sum of it.

There's a whole other argument to be had about how the current system might actually be improved, for example - as far as I know - there is no reasonable way to prevent a ""prohibited person"" from acquiring an airgun from a legitimate source; there have been plenty of tragedies at the hands of licensed firearms owners who, in retrospect, maybe ought to have had their certificates revoked, etc.

true,AngelicMelancholy,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"That may be an over-simplification. When you are murdered you will no long suffer. If you are raped, you may suffer for the rest of your life (mentally and perhaps even physically).

Imagine the hypothetical scenario, where everyone raped suffers horribly for the rest of their lives. I am willing to say that this situation is worse than if they were murdered.

Imagine the hypothetical scenario, where nobody suffers after they are raped. I can say that this situation is much better than being murdered.

So at some point between these two extremes you have the situation where being raped and being murdered are equally horrendous. (I mean on the whole, not on an individual basis.)

Reality is somewhere in between these two things. I think it is probably better than being murdered. Perhaps, those that say those things think it is worse than being murdered. Or maybe they're just talking more emotionally than anything.

My point is that:

The majority of posters in this thread agree that such individuals need ""help"" but the reality is that there are few effective interventions available. While a number of therapies have been developed in this area, they all have poor success rates. Even chemical castration may not be effective if the impulses are driven by emotion (anger, trauma, a need for power etc) rather than sexual desire as is the case with many paedophiles.

Having worked with both the perpetrators and victims of child sexual abuse I'm very conflicted when it comes to this issue. On the one hand I feel that the media's obsession with paedophilia is utterly perverse and that condemnation or lack of understanding are certainly not going to solve anything. On the other hand, I have worked with several paedophiles who swore that they had never acted on their thoughts and I am sorry to say that in each case this turned out to be untrue. Some of these individuals were extremely convincing and I felt very sympathetic towards them. My experience may have made me somewhat cynical but I still believe that as a society we should try to understand before we condemn and that more funding should be alllocated to research in order to improve the quality of treatment for sex offenders and those at risk of offending.

I think DoF is a smart decision, LFC have put Ian Ayres into a de facto DoF role, City have put the system into place as has Chelsea even Newcastle tried to (they fucked up by appointing Kinnear as DoF when it is questionable if he should be allowed do anything with a club let alone make decisions for one)....when done right it is a very effective system and has worked in every country on the planet across different sports, its a new concept to England thus there aren't many English candidates for the role (which i think would greatly increase the effectiveness), people are still struggling with how to implement it in England.

I have seen people say it won't work in England because it undermines the manager in the locker room. I don't believe that, look at our squad...Lloris, Jan, Eriksen, Lamela, Soldado, Paulinho, Sandro, Capoue, Dembele, Chirches and Holtby have all played for clubs that employ the DoF system, they understand how it works. It needs to be implemented correctly to work....Comolli was not very good at the role and then when we brought the system back it stopped working once AVB stopped talking to Baldini.  It needs to have a great deal of input from a manager and a director of scouting (keep in mind we just brought Ian Broomfield back to do this role) to effectively work....i think Baldini is capable doing the role (he has had success in the past) but i wonder how he would align with either Poch or FdB or if he is just ready to move on and retire.

As for FdB being down the list, i genuinely think the fact that Poch has managed in the PL is what boosted him up the list. He seems to be a talented and smart manager, but he also has experience in the league and i think Levy looks at Rodgers and Martinez and kicks himself for not making a move. Throw in that he would apparently be more expensive to bring in and has only managed in the Eredivisie i can see Levy and Baldini pushing him down a bit (rightly or wrongly).",0,1400190794,null,0,false,0,chizkpe,t3_25n474,t1_chizkpe,t1_chiw34a,null,1433813875,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,stop___grammar_time,silver,Silver,"A few tips: 

If you have something that you want to be read in your design but it's illegible, then it's not working and you should probably change it.

Judging by the irregularity of those shapes, it looks like you drew each panel by hand. In a design with lots of identical repeating shapes like the Tardis, don't be afraid to clone/copy and paste elements. That will not only give a more uniform appearance, it will save you a lot of time.

Speaking of irregularity, your panels are also irregularly spaced. Most graphics programs have alignment tools which can help with your spacing and alignment - this can come in handy when you're creating something with a design with lots of regularly spaced elements, like the Tardis. If the irregular hand-crafted look is what you're going for, feel free to disregard this.

Judging by the brush outlines, I'm assuming you're using Photoshop or something similar. While it can do vectors, it's not the greatest for that purpose - I'd recommend a proper vector imaging program like Illustrator or even Inkscape, a freeware alternative.

A couple technique tips: When you use the fill tool inside a shape you create with the paintbrush, it will often leave an outline on the interior side of the brushtroke where there are partially opaque pixels from the anti-aliasing (look in the white near the bottom of your doors). Also keep an eye out for partially opaque pixels (top of the left door, underneath the sign, and near the middle of the right door opposite the sign).

One final tip about lines: It looks like you tried to clean up the top of the doors manually with the brush/eraser tool. I don't know if you already know this but In Photoshop if you make a mark with the brush/eraser then hold down shift before you make your next mark, it will automatically connect the two points with a straight line. It's great for tidying up edges like the top of the doors and for making straight lines in general.

I get what you were going for and I think the idea's pretty cool - keep practicing!

true,dijin343,,Warrenpoint,"I suspect there's not going to be to much change in this round of elections, Sinn Fein and the DUP will remain very much on top, UUP continue to decline, SDLP stay about in the same place. Nothing titanic. That being said there are one or two things that might actually be worth looking out for. 


For one thing, this will be NI21's first electoral test. They aren't going to do particularly well, new parties never do. What's important for them here is getting their name out to the voters, building up their organisation on the ground, sorting out their policy and messaging and generally trying to get themselves established. I'd say NI21 can be reasonably happy with themselves if they get 4-5% in the European elections and a couple of councillors in the locals - it's unspectacular, but respectable.

On a different note Thursday could be a bad day for the PUP. They're already hanging on by their fingertips in terms of elected representatives - they're down to just two on Belfast City Council and both of those seats were narrowly won in 2011 (and one of the men who won them, veteran councillor Hugh Smith, died this week, without his personal vote it might be even more difficult for them to get in). It'd be a bit embarrassing if they failed to get any elected representatives, especially when some commentators were pondering whether the flag protests might actually revitalise the party.


UKIP I can't see gaining much ground, but Henry Reilly's not going anywhere in Kilkeel. TUV, could go either way really. On the one hand I'm not expecting them to do too well in the locals, on the other hand they might manage to do better than expected off the back of Allister's European run.

Conservatives, aww. Well they get points for trying at least, but they're not getting anything out of this exercise. Same goes for the Greens really (though unlike the Tories they can probably manage to grab a councillor or two).


Alliance I suspect will do reasonably well overall. With the UUP in decline and the APNI taking advantage they could get some decent results in the locals. The only snag might be if east Belfast turns on them in the wake of the flag protests, that would undermine any plans to build themselves up on Belfast City Council quite a bit. There was that poll from the Belfast Telegraph a few days ago that seemed to indicate that the flag protests hadn't put the electorate off, but trusting polls absolutely is never a good idea.


The big one is of course the European election. Seats one and two are nailed on for Sinn Fein and the DUP, but there's a pretty decent chance of Attwood nicking number three. Nicholson surviving is more likely than not, but an SDLP win is a distinct possibility. That really would shake things up - not only would the UUP lose their only MEP (who also happens to be their longest serving representative) and worsen their decline, but then there'd be two Nationalist MEPs and one Unionist instead of vice-versa. I wonder if we would see Mike Nesbitt going back to talking about the whole Unionist unity business if that happened.

It seems to me that people continue to see paedophilia as a choice made by an individual. There are probably 1000s of people with paedophilic tendencies that have never committed any indecent acts and it is likely that these people live in fear of their tendencies being discovered because of how the population witch-hunts these people.

To clarify; I abhor physical acts of paedophillia - people that do this must of course face the consequences. But for those that are wired that way and don't act on their impulses, help should be made available.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"Potency is a measure of  the amount of a drug required to produce an effect of a given intensity. By that definition I would argue that Weed is the more potent drug, compared to all but the most pure forms of alcohol. A user without tolerance built up would need to smoke a lot less weed to get stoned than they would need to drink alcohol to get drunk.

&gt;Also let me correct you, as tripping is not what people do when they smoke weed.

It absolutely can happen, again, if you have a very high tolerance maybe not for you, but for casual smokers, it is a real possibility. 


&gt;Countless times as a youth I experienced kids who didn't know their limits. People can shit themselves, vomit all over &amp; regularly need stomach pumps.

I have plenty of horror stories from both alcohol and weed. Have you ever tried calming someone down when they are really freaking out after smoking weed. Its easy in comparison to get a drunk person in a car. If someone get paranoid while on weed and doesn't want to co-operate, there is nothing you can do until they come down, what they do in that state can be dangerous for them, and the people they are with (try walking home while time is skipping 10 seconds ahead after every step you take).

&gt;On weekends our hospitals are full of drunks, not stoners. So again, which is more potent?

Far fewer people smoke weed than drink alcohol, and weed is illegal, so most people would avoid going to the hospital if there was a problem. So its not a very useful comparison to make.

A significant amount of the harmful elements in a joint, for instance, come from the paper and the tobacco which is often used alongside the cannabis (usually unfiltered unlike most cigarettes). This is reduced by smoking solely cannabis in a pipe, and reduced further by filtering the smoke through water in a bong. A vaporiser, however, heats to a temperature which is higher than the point at which the active compounds evaporate but lower than the point at which the plant matter combusts.

I'd say there's a very good chance of some DUP voters going for more hardline parties, especially UKIP and the TUV. The only question is how well those two parties can be expected to do. UKIP I'm not expecting much from - mainland UK parties never do well here, and most of their strength has come from defections rather than popularity. The TUV could put in a very strong showing though - Allister's got good form in European elections and with his coattails to cling to their council candidates could do well.

Kind of relevant story: My year 7 IT teacher turned out to be a paedophile and not the type who was interested in seeking help, either. He walked around the classroom and instead of addressing us by our actual names he'd call us ""flower"" or ""petal"" if we were girls, or ""sausage"" if we were boys. We thought it was weird but we just laughed about it instead of realising how creepy or weird it was (we were just in year 7 after all and didn't understand the sexual implications behind the nicknames).

Later he got fired after they found child porn on his home file. At school. He actually kept it on his *school home file*. Where the network technicians could easily find it. It's almost like he wanted to be caught... especially with those bloody nicknames. He never actually harmed a student, as far as I know. 

This was back in the year 1998 and things were probably quite different back then (god I feel old now!). People probably did keep copious amounts of CP on their computers and get away with it. It was certainly easy enough to accidentally stumble upon if you used P2P networks like Kazaa. Man, those were truly the ""Wild West"" days of the net when I think about it.

Handguns weren't banned. The licensing conditions for semi-automatic, centrefire, rifled barrelled firearms and firearms with an overall length of about two foot and a barrel under about foot were amended.  Badly crafted law isn't really an argument against law in principle.

The stated aim of the legislation was to reduce the damage that could be done by a licensed firearms owner going on the rampage.  I'm not sure how the success or otherwise of that can be determined and I don't think that anyone seriously believes that it's possible to prevent spree killers ever striking.

I would say there is a good argument for loosening up the restrictions on shorter guns but civil servants can't seem to work out how to distinguish a match .22 from a Browning Hi Power in law and I'm having trouble getting the Sunday Mail worked up about it.

There are still loads of really fun guns to shoot and if you have serious use for a powerful centrefire pistol you can have one.

&gt;__Semantic satiation__ (also __semantic saturation__) is a [psychological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological) phenomenon in which [repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition_(rhetorical_device\)) causes a word or phrase to temporarily lose [meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_(linguistic\)) for the listener, who then processes the speech as repeated meaningless sounds.

We live in a society where most men are assumed to be paedophilic molesters, as demonstrated [by this vid](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/25n1za/discrimination_against_men_sexist_double/) on /r/videos today.  I can only imagine the horror of knowing that I liked was wrong, but being unable to do anything about it.  The guilt of it.  Having nowhere to turn.

It's depressing I have to preface what I'm about to say next; but I think I have to.  I'm not a paedophile or into anything illegal: but I have my own sexual hangups that most people would find weird.  I often hate that I can't just 'like' normal stuff.  I have been depressed, and I remember hating on myself for being into strange things, and it only emphised to me how not normal I was.

When the country is in a period of austerity and the crime in question is not threatening social unrest or personal harm, frankly yes.

You will not ever eradicate all crime, that is not something anyone sane expects can ever happen. As you throw resources at a problem, diminishing marginal returns ensures you see less and less benefit. With a fraud rate of less than 1% (contrast with underpayment of over 2%), it's hard to justify **further** measures to reduce its occurrence beyond the (apparently successful) ones we already employ.

LGB people are *just* being granted fundamental human rights that you have taken for granted for decades, and that's still deeply controversial.  We still have huge amounts of bullying and hate crime and all the major religious groups still preach that we are evil.  It's only 6 years since Iris Robinson said that we are *worse* than paedophiles, the Catholic church still likes to label its child-abusing priests as ""homosexuals"" and blame homosexuality for their abuse, and Putin makes comparisons to paedophilia every time he defends his propaganda laws.

Secondly, equating homosexuality with paedophilia has undoubtedly been the *single* most common and devastating way of attacking us for decades.  Why would you want to perpetuate that?

Thirdly, the analogy isn't even useful.  The medical/scientific community regards homosexuality as a normal variation in human sexuality, and paedophilia as a mental illness.  I don't think there is any evidence that they work in remotely the same way.  Homosexuality is harmless, whereas it is indisputable that paedophilia frequently leads to child abuse.  Of *course* we don't view or treat homosexuality and paedophilia in remotely the same way, and hopefully we never will.

Wouldn't having a european parliament in which no country has enough power to prevent something from affecting their country by definition erode a country's self-determination, since you are giving the power to make and abolish laws to an entity that is above your own leaders? I would expect that the real debate wouldn't be whether or not it lessens your own self determination, but rather whether or not it is worth it. Case in point, the United *States* of America. Federal pluralism lasted for a while and has died a slow death since the Civil War.

Has nothing to do with the ban. The ban only came in during the 90's and only affected handguns. BEFORE the ban, handgun ownership was less than 1% anyway. British people have never been into gun culture in the way that the US is.

Also, shotguns and rifles are legal, and there are over 2 MILLION guns in private ownership, yet only a handful of gun crimes per year. The UK just isn't a violent place which uses guns. Again, we are not America. We don't have the gangs, the drug problem, the poverty, the dense cities or many many other factors which all give them higher crime than us.

true,Frankeh,eng-eastsusex,South East,"&gt;Secondly, equating homosexuality with paedophilia has undoubtedly been the single most common and devastating way of attacking us for decades. Why would you want to perpetuate that?

Very unfortunate, but it's relevant to the conversation at hand. I'm not saying homosexuals are paedophiles or vice versa. If *that's* what people take away from my comment then they're idiots who should probably step away from the computer and not handle heavy machinery. 

&gt;The medical/scientific community regards homosexuality as a normal variation in human sexuality, and paedophilia as a mental illness.

But somethings present status as a mental illness doesn't make it fact. You should know that. 

In fact, I'm just skimming the wikipedia article on it now and while it says it's not yet known what causes it, there has been some research that found:

&gt;They report that their findings suggest that there are one or more neurological characteristics present at birth that cause or increase the likelihood of being pedophilic. Evidence of familial transmittability ""suggests, but does not prove that genetic factors are responsible"" for the development of pedophilia.

So it's possible it's something you're born with. Very comparable to homosexuality and hetrosexuality, as historically unfortunate as that that may be for you. 

&gt;I think being sexually abused as a child is probably worse, to be honest. But I suppose sympathising with abused children wouldn't be contrarian enough for this site.

You're speaking this as if it's a hypothetical situation. We already have an EU parliament. You're correct in that no country has a majority. But what difference does that make? EU seats are based on population, so the UK is't going to have the most, but let's just say the UK did have a majority. UK MEPs currently are members of 11 parties (12 if you include the UKIP defector). How do you expect 11 political parties to agree on a consensus as to how to use its majority power?

MEPs join a larger European political party. If a British person votes Labour, they're effectively making a vote for the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, which is currently the second biggest EU 'party' and Labour is a member of that.

So although you have 28 different countries, with many many languages and different cultures, by voting in particular ways you're helping set how the EU will proceed based on which group is powerful in the parliament. It's not massively different from domestic politics. While the UK doesn't have the biggest share of MEPs, it is one of the biggest. We have 9.5% of EU parliament seats. Malta has 0.8%. It is the big countries of Europe that lead it mostly. France and Germany are the most important EU states and have big powers. The UK slightly less so since, although we have a lot of MEPs and are rich and pay lot into it, we're not in the Eurozone and we tend to sit on the sidelines a bit more.

And the EU doesn't have complete control either. Nations retain their sovereignty. They are free to leave. They can still have their own laws. They didn't have to ratify the Lisbon Treaty.",0,1400199347,null,0,false,0,chj3cek,t3_25o1ho,t1_chj3cek,t1_chj2oa5,null,1433815720,9,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,9

Of course we don't view or treat homosexuality and paedophilia in remotely the same way, and hopefully we never will.

They work in exactly the same way. The difference in classification is because one is harmful to society and the other is not.

As for other stuff to check out, **Rimmel** do some nice eyeliners and shadow pencils, I *think* they're cheaper than in the US/Canada but not sure. 

**Soap and Glory** stuff is nice, kinda quirky, same kinda vibe as Benefit but drugstore prices. They also do bath/skincare stuff that smells wonderful. (Sugar Crush, I want to eat everything with that scent)

I've heard **MUA** do palettes for a couple of pounds that if not dupes are quite similar to the Naked palettes.

Not tried it myself, but **Collection**'s Lasting Perfection Concealer seems to get mad love from the internet. They do some nice shadow pencils too, and glitter liquid liners that are wonderful for adding a bit of sparkle (beigey gold sparkles all over the lid with a flick and a vampy lip, I've never felt so glamorous!)

If you're into nail polish **Barry M** have a generally nice formula and are very reasonably priced. Their Blink eyeliner is also everything you could ever want from a felt-tip liner.

**Models Own** do some nice polish too, they have speckled ones at the moment similar to the ones Illamasqua did a while back.

**Illamasqua** have a flagship store in London that could be worth a look if you're there. 

If you're interested in skincare, La Roche Posay is amazing, I dunno can you get that at home but if not it's definitely worth checking out!

Don't buy any MAC or Urban Decay or Benefit or any of that stuff, it's all way more expensive this side of the ocean, as are the likes of Essie, OPI, China Glaze.

Boots and Superdrug stock different brands, so check out both!

**Boots Only**: Models Own, Soap and Glory, Seventeen, No. 7,

- Tottenham blew 100m on new players, yet they were way worse off without Bale.

- Suarez was also our top assister up until the last game where Gerrard got ahead. He's really unselfish up front. Sturridge isn't as selfish as people make him out to be, but he is worse than Suarez so it might hurt us. 

- Wouldn't you feel more confident going into a game with one of the top 3 best players in the world rather than 3 or 4 of the top 50? It helps our whole team having him there.

- One would presume if we had £90M in Suarez-money we could reasonably expect a new striker/forward (or two) to come in.

- See previous.  The money would be reinvested, hopefully wisely, and I imagine more creative-type player(s) would be on the cards.

- A very good team will beat an excellent individual any day of the week.  I'm sure BR would do a fine job of letting the remaining players know they aren't rubbish and are more than capable of winning a game without Suarez.

Yeah, I've done some reading on this and the characterization of sexual abuse to a child as crimes of opportunity is not exactly wrong.

So you may have someone who is sexually attracted to children, but never rapes or harms them.  Then you may have a paedofile who does, but those could be divided into two camps, those whose pathology is psychotic and the sexual behavior is motivated from the desire to exert power over someone, or those who have a love of children and try to court them.

All money from the day will raise funds for Forces Support, who operate all over the UK. They provide practical support for bereaved military families. This help for the families of the fallen sounds simple but has shown to have hugely beneficial effects for those left behind.

Ken McNaught, who played for Villa in their famous victory over Bayern Munich, said: ""I would personally like to thank all our former players for giving up their time to come and join our Legends side for this very worthwhile event.

Callum Robinson is expected to commit his future to Aston Villa despite the rookie striker’s new contract negotiations stalling.

The 19-year-old Bodymoor Heath academy graduate is a free agent this summer and has been unable to agree terms with the club.

There is a new two-year deal on the table, but Robinson feels his rise to the fringes of the first team is not reflected in the offer.

He is expected to resume negotiations after he returns from Villa’s involvement in the Hong Kong Soccer Sevens youth tournament next weekend.

Homosexual/heterosexual relationships are purely a matter of gender preference and legal in all respects, the only taboo for homosexuals stems from a result of outmoded religious taboos. Paedophile taboo stems from the fact that it's considered to be quite wrong for sexual predators to target children. 

It's like puppies for example. Most people see them as cute and just want to play with them. The deviants would see them as the same, but want to fuck them as well.

It's a weird situation. I'd take Chadli on the left and Lamela on the right, and Townsend probably wouldn't be too happy with being a rotation player.

His value on Transfermarkt puts him at 6.2 million Pounds. Add in an extra ~1-2 million for selling to a rival like Everton, then ~3-5 million for English inflation. If I were Martinez, the most I'd go for him is 13 million, which is a decent pull.

I'll concede this. The Sandro episode, no matter how twisted by media, was stupid. He should've been played against Liverpool, and he should've started in games where we needed some steel in the middle. Sherwood didn't do that, and it cost us points this season. 

&gt;When AVB left we were 4 points out of champs league and in all competitions,

It's not even about the results with AVB for me. Look at Roberto ""Penaldo"". Those 1-0 victories got us that far. AVB couldn't make heads or tails of a squad he had a say in building. Our attack was toothless. We had incredible amounts of possession, but it was just stupid what we did with it. There was no killer through ball at the final third when the likes of Holtby, Siggy and Eriksen played for us. That's not excusable at all. A combination of sheer luck got us through AVB's insanity and dickishness near the end. 

The all competitions thing is bullshit, by the way. Tim Sherwood's first game in charge was a 2-1 loss against West Ham, so that takes the League Cup out of the question. How many FA Cup games did we even play with AVB around? Considering the mistakes of that day, when the scum counterattacked like that, and Sherwood played a carbon copy of AVB's high line, AVB could've done fuck all that day. 

&gt;Next season if we decide to keep bentelab or kane

This is just a shockingly bad statement on so many levels, I'm sorry to say that, but it just is. 

We've already decided to keep Bentaleb around. He's not going to rot on the bench with either Pochettino or Fdb, both of who love high-pressing games. Bentaleb can add to the attack, which neither Capoue or Sandro can do with the same impact. In fairness to them, that's not why we brought them in in the first place. 

Seriously, Bentaleb is one of the hottest youth commodities in the league. I'll put him alongside Janazzuj, because I think he can be as influential if played in a three man midfield, in his proper position. 

&gt;We dont need a youth manager

Regardless of Pochettino or FdB, expect one. One is from the most productive youth academy in Europe, and the other fielded five players under 20 against Manchester fucking United. We have quality U-21s available to us, why on Earth would we send them off to pointless loans in the Championship when we can play them against mid and lower table sides? That way everyone wins-first team can rest for Europe, youth get valuable playing time. 

The only top club in terms of academy success in the PL that surpasses us is Liverpool, Jordan Ibe and Sterling and all that. Letting a talent like Taarabt slip away from us (look at him, Milan's best player, a great scorer and assister, and you know what else? *Left footed, a field we seem to be completely lost in.*), but I'll be really pissed if we let someone like Bentaleb or Kane go.

true,dontrepeatdumbshit,null,null,"not sure if i saw it on reddit or elsewhere but i rememember reading an article about pre-colonial hawaiian sexual practices. basically everyone had sex with everyone. sex was not hidden either. if a couple was horny they would just fuck right in front of everyone. sex with young people was also considered perfectly acceptable. children would mimic what they saw the adults doing. there was no shame associated with sex.

on the other hand, modern society is very prudish. people are conditioned to be ashamed of their sexuality (as well as their bodies). one cannot be naked in public because a naked body is considered sexual and sex in public is not allowed. a man innocently sunbathing naked in a public park runs the risk of being arrested and convicted as a sex offender.

we, as a society, lie to our children about sex; we basically hide it from them and then wonder why they are confused when they find out about it. that is why paedophiles are vilified. they don't follow the rules of hiding sexuality from children. in my opinion, the big lie that we are all supposed to uphold is much more harmful than a guy jerking off to pictures of people under the age of 18 (which is a totally arbitrary number anyway).",1,1400213183,null,0,false,0,chj96o4,t3_25n96t,t1_chj96o4,t3_25n96t,null,1433818480,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

Maybe he is a horse, and his life expectancy is only 25 to 30 years, and this is his last chance to be elected before Jeremy Clarkson storms out of the Oxfordshire countryside and puts him down with a gun. They shoot horses, don't they?

true,bookwench,null,null,"We all have impulses and urges which are unhealthy. Some people have more of them than others, and some people feel them more strongly than others. For the purposes of this discussion, I'm going to define these unhealthy impulses as any impulse which causes harm (not damage, harm, fine distinction) to others *or yourself* through deliberate, intended action or through a selfish lack of consideration for the obvious consequences. 

What matters as to whether you're a good person or not isn't actually having these impulses - it's entirely what you do with them. And since all action starts within ourselves, all of the ways in which we can choose to be good or evil, healthy or unhealthy, also start within ourselves, and all the groundwork for our behavior is laid within us, daily, in our thoughts and in the data we choose to consume. 

If you encourage unhealthy impulses inside yourself, find excuses for them, try to rationalize them, fantasize about acting them out, you're feeding them in your own mind and should not be surprised to be eventually considered damaged, evil, and ill by those around you. 

If you critically assess your own impulses, deliberately read up on things that challenge your viewpoints, and maintain a strict mental discipline about what you will and won't allow yourself to think or indulge in, you'll be much healthier and stronger as a person and in time might find peace through the formation of healthy mental habits. 


Things which are helpful: 
Support groups, open discussion, and support from friends and family in your struggle. 

Things which alcoholics, drug addicts, and gambling addicts receive:  
Support groups, open discussion, and support from friends and family in your struggle. 

Things which pedophiles, violent offenders, and other forms of individually and socially damaging behaviour do not receive: 
Support groups, open discussion, and support from friends and family in your struggle. 

Difference between these things: one set mostly harms the individual while the other set mostly harms others. 

Reason: to provide support and unconditional caring in your struggle, when your struggle involves something which damages a vulnerable part of society, can be mistaken as approving of your behaviour. We hold an internal zero-tolerance policy for behaviour which could damage others; we, as a society, see any acceptance of certain behaviours as an unforgivable step in the wrong direction. We cannot even make arguments about clean needles and decriminalizing private or purely self-destructive behaviour, because while slipping up as a drug addict or a gambling addict will harm you individually and by extension your loved ones, to slip up when you are a pedophile or prone to violence or a drunk driver is to cause permanent, irreparable harm. And as a society we are strongly driven, logically and emotionally, to protect ourselves from those who pose this sort of risk. Why should we put our children or our selves at risk of permeant damage for your benefit, when your innermost desires are to hurt us? 

This is why you'll never get a pedophile revolution. The distinction between ""things that are harmless"" and ""things which are harmful"" is too deeply rooted; no amount of compassion, no arguments about love, will ever overcome the collective will of the family unit to protect itself at all costs. That will is the survival of the species and it is brutally practical, and it does not care about the individual. 

That is why, when you have one of the most difficult problems it's possible to have as a human being, you will find no outside help from anyone but other people like you, people who are too stupid to actually be helpful, and people who have nothing left to lose. 

Be wary of people like you because they will try to drag you down if they fail; it'll make them feel more validated. Be wary of stupid people because they will agree with you and set up an uncritical feedback loop that can encourage bad behaviour and bad thought processes. Be least wary of those with nothing left to lose; they're the ones who might be your best bet - but good luck finding anyone like that who'll help you.

No, they hadn't been discussing sex. They had been discussing sexuality. I don't think asking about attitudes towards sexuality, in the abstract, are in any way damaging or offensive.

This is my main query. Why don't the southern Irish consider themselves British?

Sorry for coming across as an idiot, I just don't understand why the southern Irish refuse to work with us. They are a Republic, right? But why? It would be better if they were part of the UK. I see no reason for Eire being separate from the UK.

Sorry if that sounds ignorant, but it's what most us British feel.

* You cannot use an air rifle on any land without owners consent, furthermore airguns should not be used within 15 metres of any public right of way if it inconveniences it's travellers.

I think you misunderstand exactly what a teacher's job involves. I'm a teacher in a private academy abroad, so I can't speak for Gove and the UK, but the majority of my time isn't spent in the classroom. I have 25 hours of teaching time per week, but then I have to plan lessons, mark homework, attend meetings, complete paperwork, prepare our own school exams (i.e., write the exam paper), research external exams that my students are taking so that I can help them prepare for it, research potential resources that the school might want to use, hold catch-up sessions for struggling students, write reports, meet with parents when necessary... Teaching can be a lot of fun, but the classroom time is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what the job involves.

From what I've heard from friends who are teachers in the UK, the amount of paperwork and admin they have to do sounds far higher than mine, and the resources they have to use are a lot work (and changing from year to year). Making a curriculim work for their students is one thing, but take it from me - if you're shattered and fed up from all of the other shit you have do during the week, your lessons will suffer.

true,PeterBrett,scot-Lothian,Lothian,"&gt; Anyone who is selfish enough not to remove themselves entirely from that situation and their ability to hurt people is not anyone I can ever sympathise with. if somebody has those desires, they need to understand how directly detrimental those desires are to society, and take measures to make themselves not be a threat to others (e.g. therapy, chemical measures to remove the sexual need or ability to do the damaging things). It might suck, but certainly not as much as it sucks to get molested.

Wasn't the *whole point of this discussion* was that society's attitude is making people feel too terrified and ashamed to even raise the topic of paedophilia if they think they might be affected? It's driving people away from getting access to the care and support they need, and it's something that needs to change; no innocent person should be driven to suicide like OP's friend.

&gt; Most people can get through their everyday lives without fantasising about raping innocent people. If they can't, they need to take steps to ensure they never hurt people ever.

* Is it possible that most paedophiles fantasise about consensual sex with children? I'm aware that that's not possible, but we are talking about fantasy. It would be interesting to hear what a paedophile has to say about it.

Well now you can't be *sure* of that can you? While there is agreement that biological factors do play a part - one can't eliminate environmental factors when it comes to sexual preferences.

Even if there's a distinction between ""gay"" and ""straight"" how do you explain fetishes? Some people are into bondage, some into particular groups of clothing, some into feet and legs and other body parts... that *surely* has to be partially environmental - because you're not born with a knowledge of clothing types - that has to be learned.

So clearly at least some aspects of sexuality are influenced by environment.

Many animals are clearly influenced, sexually, by their environment - as a means of keeping the population in balance.

All of the reports that talk about the safety and viability of fracking in the UK clearly state that stronger legislation is needed to ensure that construction and operation of these facilities are up to standard. This also matches the lessons learned from the US experience.

Now only last week we got an announcement from a house of lords committee saying that fracking should be national priority and that the application process should be streamlined. This seems to be counter to many organisations recommendations of having a solid legislative background before moving ahead.

It seems to me, that we are heading for yet another situation where policy is not decided by evidence or even expert advice.

There's two basic ideas: pedophiles usually have low self esteem so one theory is that they engage with children because they are less intimidated by them, but it could be also that the pedophiles realizes they are sexually abnormal and they therefore have low self esteem.  It seems that pedophiles like gay people discover their sexual attractions upon puberty.  They don't choose to  be pedophiles they just are.  Now some gay and lesbian people say they knew they were different from an early age, but this is difficult to tell with pedophilia because as you say you crushed on people around you who were young.  Also you mentioned your crushes at age 11, which is when you were moving into early adolescence.  For pedophiles it's pretty much preadolescence (at least physically).

I think it's also important to know, because I compared gay and lesbians to pedophiles, that with pedophilia there is a correlation to other anti-social behaviors, which is not the case with homosexuality.

true,JoeDaStudd,null,null," &gt; I know my friend never harmed a child.     
How do you know?    
The damage paedophiles can and do cause is in most cases is irreparable.    
Rehabilitation, castration and drugs have all failed to stop the urges and subsequent actions they carry out based on those urges.     
      
I know of a primary school where the headmaster molested over half of the students, was convicted and was released within 18 months on good behaviour. After release he purchased a puppy and frequently the local parks focusing on the play areas. He later got a job as a bus driver including routes with high % child passengers.    
I've seen the victims break down upon just hearing the person in questions name, they refuse to go anywhere said person may be and most have had serious issues with any form of long term relationship.    
It not only affects the victims, but also the victims family and friends. There were numerous broken marriages, mental breakdowns and serious long term damage.     
Thats just the damage you can see, not including all the mental damage/scarring.
        
This one *person* (if you can call him that) ruined/damaged the lives of hundreds of people and more then likely is still doing the same now.
      
Personally if someone offered me the job of killing all proven paedophiles, I would take the job and thank them for it.      
You can't fix them, you can't reason with them and you can't repair the damage they cause.

WhoScored gave Firmino an 8.8 while Volland only had a 7.4. The way they valuate the performance has severe flaws. Volland made a decisive through ball that led to the first goal, but because the keeper got a hand to the strikers first effort, requiring the striker to follow through to tap it in, Volland didn't get whatever points are attributed to an assist.

Firmino had a decent game but his passing under pressure was poor and he tries to dribble his way out of trouble to compensate. His control is mostly good but inconsistent, once leading to him losing the ball cheaply and Bayern nearly scoring. Yet this was not reflected on any points basis. He got the goal to tie the game showing great balance/composure, and finished well with his weak foot.

It would be difficult to say Firmino is an improvement on Coutinho from that match alone, but I'd have to see more of him to fairly judge that.

People really need to pay less attention to WhoScored ratings, the site is fantastic to see stats from a match (passing accuracy, through balls, defensive contributions, etc.) but forming an opinion off of it's rating system is no different to forming one based on how good a player is on Fifa.",0,1400229760,null,0,false,0,chjdood,t3_25n9x7,t1_chjdood,t3_25n9x7,null,1433820660,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Chapter 6 on pension wealth is particularly interesting, while the Guardian mentioned (for obvious Guardian reasons) that men had on average 80% more pension wealth than women it failed to mention (again for obvious Guardian reasons) a few other points:

- pension wealth is the biggest single factor in wealth
- 66% of people have no pension wealth at all
- 85% of public sector workers do (to the 15%, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!)
- public sectors workers have a median pension wealth of £42k, private £24k
- public sector pension wealth has increased in the period measured, private has fallen

While not making the 1%, the single biggest group that constitutes the wealthy would appear to be public sector workers in their late 40's or 50's, living in the south east, or basically Guardian readers.

In theory this is an improvement: schools can decide what's needed instead of having a prescribed amount set centrally. The trouble is that budgets have been cut as well. 

The school my kids go to pays for catch up teaching out of the Pupil Premium. I don't know what's going to happen when everyone will get free school meals. I expect income from Pupil Premium will drop dramatically. 

The other key is locality working. In my area all the schools have got together and spun up a community interest company which employs or subcontracts specialist staff such as speech therapists as well as staff for catch up teaching. Unfortunately with the push towards academies all this might have to change.

true,mr-strange,null,null,"Energy policy is not sufficiently open to public discussion. The government hasn't revealed any detailed argument for fracking - in fact, it seems to me that they are going out of their way to avoid talking about the deeper pros &amp; cons.

Here's what I find most interesting: Politically, it's madness for the Tories to support fracking. It's deeply unpopular with nimbys, and it will affect mostly Tory-held, rural constituencies. They need those votes.

So, I suspect that there is an urgent, technocratic motivation for them to push for fracking: We all know that the nation's fleet of coal-fired power stations is reaching end of life within just a few short years. Successive government have dithered about proper replacements, and now the time is up. There is no way we can build enough new nuclear in the time remaining. Solar &amp; wind simply can't provide the base-load supply, even if we could build them fast enough. I fear that new gas-fired power stations are simply the only remaining way to keep the lights on past 2016.

Why wouldn't they want to put this to the public? Well, the gas supply from fracking is potentially large, but it's short lived. Each well only lasts a year or two, and the whole field will probably be mined out in a couple of decades. After that, we'll be back to square one. Looked at that way, fracking might make sense in the short term, but only if we start building out new nuclear (or whatever) *right now*, so that we've got something to take over when the gas runs out.

So one issue here is that society makes it very, very difficult for someone with those desires to get therapy, chemical measures etc. We treat a paedophile who asks for help with their desires as a potential criminal, in order to prevent child abuse. This means that someone who is aware that their desires are wrong, and who intends to avoid acting on them is discouraged from seeking professional help; in turn, this increases the chances that a paedophile will get support from other paedophiles (some of whom may be active and abusive), as they have nowhere else to turn if they want support without judgement.

Effectively, we encourage paedophiles to only seek help from other paedophiles; this results in a twisted world view, where it's not ""abuse"", it's ""an expression of love"". If we didn't do that (if we treated non-abusive paedophiles as having a medical problem), they'd be getting their world view from normal adults, and would find it easier to accept that they're not able to have sex with children; further, they'd have professional help keeping to that (be it regular counselling sessions to remind them that sex with children is never consensual, and their fantasies have to remain fantasies, chemical aids if needed, or just an understanding that there are some jobs that are too risky to put you in, and we should accept that if the only job you're qualified for is school caretaker, then society is better off with you unemployed).",0,1400233071,null,0,false,0,chje82s,t3_25n96t,t1_chje82s,t1_chjcd2t,null,1433820914,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

&gt;**Is Homosexuality a Paraphilia? The Evidence For and Against**

&gt;Although those literatures remain underdeveloped, the existing findings thus far suggest that homosexuality has a pattern of correlates largely, but not entirely, distinct from that identified among the paraphilias. At least, if homosexuality were deemed a paraphilia, it would be relatively unique among them, taxonometrically speaking.

Homosexuality is the same in that it shares the same onset, but it's different because homosexual people have some very distinct other markers (IQ, height, birth order, etc.) from heterosexual people, but paraphilias are not distinct from the general population really.

This would indicate that although both are 'natural' or at birth, homosexuality is a different kind of change than the change that gives rise to paraphilias.

Bear in mind even benign paraphilias such as cross-dressing or wearing diapers are classified as such because they are deemed atypical, it's to do with 'is this normal sexual behaviour?'

Yes, the principles of my subject are remaining the same - Gove isn't able to actually change the French language. However, while my subject has not seen major changes yet, the new GCSE will come in within the next few years and the rumour is that the new MFL curriculum/GCSE will have a heavy emphasis on grammar and translation. Grammar is important and translation is a useful skill, but neither of these should come at the expense of learning to communicate - at present, the GCSE is more about communication in the target language, with grammar and translation becoming more important and formally examined at AS and A2 level. Translation is also a lot more difficult than a lot of people think - it's not just about knowing what words mean but also understanding and conveying the appropriate tone and nuances of language, skills that will be difficult to teach. I will, of course, reserve judgement until the new curriculum is confirmed, but my worry is that my subject is going to become harder (and it's already regarded as one of the hardest subjects to get a top GCSE grade in), tedious both to teach and to learn, and less useful to kids than it is now as the emphasis moves away from communication skills.

You get to play with your friends for a bit then you had to say a prayer you didn't say the prayer you got put in the back room until you agreed to do it.

Most kids wouldn't say anything and went along with it because who doesn't want free toys and to hang out with their friends. Obviously one of the kids had said something to the parents and most of us were pulled out of the club including myself.

The thing is renewable power gives poor power generation per unit land consumed - there's just not enough space for enough of them to satisfy future demand.


In 2012, average power demand in the UK was 35.8 GW [1].
The UK' current nuclear reactors produce around 10.5 GW from 14 plants [2]: about a third of our needs. We haven't built a new one since 1995*.

A typical 1 GW reactor will produce 20 m^3 of high-level** nuclear waste per year. This is reprocessed down to 3 m^3 of vitrified waste for storage [3].

Yes, we then have to find a place to safely store that 3 m^3 for the next few thousand years. The approach taken is to stick it in an [INDESTRUCTIBLE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mHtOW-OBO4) container and place it inside a hollowed-out mountain forever.

Compared to the 400,000 tonnes of toxic ash produced by a 1 GW coal plant, the nuclear waste is much easier to deal with. Particularly because the coal ash is pretty radioactive [5].


A single wind turbine produces approximately 0.029 GW under optimal wind conditions [4]. With some arithmetic we can therefore conclude we need 26 wind turbines to replace one typical UK nuclear plant, assuming all of them produce optimal power all the time.

Since they won't, you're in practice going to need to build a lot more. This will take up an enormous amount of space and require vast amounts of fuel usage to get the damn things to the remote hillside you're building them on (and then you have to maintain them). Ew.


In short: Nuclear is the only practical option. It's received lots of bad press due to accidents, however these are typically blown out of all proportion in the media. There's an excellent [diagram](http://xkcd.com/radiation/) on xkcd showing the relative radioactivity of some things.
Note in particular the ""yearly release limit for a nuclear power plant"". Notice how this is much less than the dose you get yearly from potassium in your body. I just had a CT scan (seriously) and received 28 times the yearly release limit from a nuclear plant in a few minutes. Still only a bit more than 1/7 of the maximum dose allowed for radiation workers, and still only 7% of the smallest dose linked to an increased cancer risk.
So when you hear from the media ""The plant has leaked 100x the maximum amount it may emit in a year!"", they mean ""It leaked half the amount  a worker is allowed to be exposed to in a year!"".


Whoop-de-fucking doo.


That diagram has nice illustrations for notable accidents. Realistically, the only bad nuclear accident we've had was Chernobyl, and that is entirely due to the operators being fucking morons. Modern reactor designs simply do not permit operators to do the retarded things those guys did that day - they'll shut down in disgust long before things get that bad. As for Fukushima: It was hit by a fucking tsunami. Most of the reactors shut down successfully, and the world has learned from what went wrong there to prevent a similar problem happening again. The effects are localised and still pretty minor (see the chart). Nothing compared to Chernobyl.


We are a little bit cursed by being really good at detecting minute amounts of radiation, and having very strict targets about not releasing it. These two combine to make great headlines, inflaming people's fear.


So, yes, end of rant. I get bothered by people thinking we can go ""100% rewnewable"". We just can't. It's not practical. It's not going to keep up with demand. Nuclear fission power should keep us going for a few hundred years: plenty of time for projects like ITER to get fusion power sorted and give us a permanent, perfect solution (fuelled by seawater, only byproduct is helium... which we have a shortage of.),
Of course, it'd be nice if someone actually funded the fucking research... but that's a story for another rant. :P


\* This is important: Largely because anti-nuclear people prevent the construction of new reactors, we are still using aging, old designs. The people who are scared about nuclear safety are actually reducing safety by preventing us from building newer, safer, more efficient nuclear reactors.

**According to [3], low-level nuclear waste can just go into landfill: It's things like ""tools that have been used near radioactive sources that have become slightly activated"". Doesn't need burying inside a mountain for all eternity.

BioSS is here too which again applies statistical methodology to biology.

But yeah there is quite a lot of collaboration between the departments as the DTC ran for like over a decade and they will get another source of funding soon - also historically there has been Dayan, Carmena etc. studying here. So in terms of computational neuroscience there is a lot.

I will note that when we had to do a neuroscience course in the first semester alongside the informatics stuff there were clashes and it sucked. Also there are biologically inspired stuff in informatics such as the bioinformatics set of modules, the neural computation ones, the neural info proc one, the cognitive neuroscience one, the computational neuroscience vision one...

So yeah it's a good place to do it - I hope you enjoy machine learning :P

true,edvol44,null,null,"From the descriptions that I've been given so far, they sound worse than the American tea party. A bunch of tea partiers actually have good ideas (yes there are a bunch of nutjobs and yes they have a bunch of bad ideas to go with their good ones, but it's not all bad). Back a couple summers ago a bunch of them even managed to agree on a budget with a bunch of far left congressmen. The ""mainstream"" guys in the middle killed it though and it never even made it to the floor.

Edit: I am working in an edit that I think will explain some of what I said, and hopefully provide some insight into UKIP if it is anything like the tea party. Check it out in a bit when I'm done.

Edit2:It is important to note though that the tea party has changed since it started. I remember when it started. It wasn't just far right people, but rather it was a protest of government and big business (particularly in the financial industry) being in bed together to the detriment of the rest of the country. This included socialists, libertarians, centrists, people of all stripes who were against what is essentially fascism (the economic system, not the other ideologies normally associated with fascism). Since then, wealthy far right interests have been very successful in hijacking it to the point where many of the initial people have been pushed out or drowned out by the cacophonous hypocrites that have managed to take advantage of the movement. This is part of why occupy wall street and associated movements have resisted cohesion for so long. They saw what happened with the tea party and they really really don't want a leftist equivalent forming that twists their message or adds a ton of baggage to it that goes against so much of what they originally wanted to stand for. This story never gets heard outside of the US as far as I can tell, and rarely is heard here either, unless you talk to someone who was somewhat involved with OWS or with the tea party initially. I suspect that UKIP, if it gains power, will morph into something else (even more than it already seems to have done) in a similar way, beyond the single issue that they support. As far as I can tell, their main point does deserve discussion because such a large minority supports it, even if it is ultimately not the best idea. Because if it gets ignored or discounted too much, you will see their support increase and their radicalism increase as well, as people get more and more fed up with feeling/being ignored by the powers that be. That is how the tea party got the way it is.


It started with (and still has) a bunch of issues that really need to be addressed or at least receive serious consideration, but all you ever hear is the nutjob ideas from their nutjob members, never about the good ideas from their more thoughtful members, because that is all that the media ever wants to give airtime to (including fox news, I'm increasingly convinced that they were created to discredit conservatives and make their viewers dumber, while slowly pushing them to support or oppose certain interests that they otherwise wouldn't). It would be like judging a whole wing of the democratic party based off of what Al Sharpton says instead of Bernie Sanders. 


In no particular order, here are some of the complaints of the tea party. I’ll let you decide how unreasonable they are. The fact that many of these don’t get properly addressed by pro-government people creates the problem of the only solution being offered is to dismantle the government. I don’t think that is the best idea, but what can you do, they say? I haven’t touched on social issues because you are probably well aware of teaparty views on them, most of it can’t be implemented or banned at a federal level anyway apart from constitutional amendments that won’t pass, except for court decisions sometimes, which are largely not related to the actions of the legislative branch (apart from approving supreme court justices, which happens rarely). Most of that stuff is just a distraction. Anyway, here goes:


1.	The government spends more on interest payments on our debt than it spends on transportation in this country (this is a huge number, and our infrastructure really needs upgrades), and the national debt seems to be spiraling out of control. Inflation sucks, and the number is much higher than the generally quoted adjusted number (if you use the metric from before 1980 instead of today’s, it would be 9.8% rather than 2.1% or whatever). 


2.	Too big to fail banks have only gotten bigger, and QE infinity isn’t trickling down to the little guy. 


3.	The recovery is not a recovery for most people, or if it is, barely so.


4.	Obamacare is stupid. (So was our system before, but that is somewhat beside the point) A federal mandate of this kind is pretty obviously illegal (the whole ""it's a tax"" thing is crap and everyone knows it), even if it is a better idea than what we had before (which, for me anyway, it is, because I can afford to get health insurance now, even though I can’t log onto the damn insurance company’s website—which isn’t the government’s fault—to fix the duplicate setup that happened somehow—which is, at least in part.) It doesn't do much or anything to lower the basic incentive system that drives costs so high, even though it does increase competition and maybe lower some costs in the short term, these malincentives are still in place and will still make things worse in the long term. Many view it as a bailout for health insurance companies (it’s not not a bailout for them…), which are universally hated by everyone. 


5.	The school system sucks, and has gotten worse in a lot of places even as, or as a result of, more money and oversight gets thrown at it or less money and more oversight. The oversight is not helping much (some new things theyre trying might help generally, but I doubt it, and it will be 10 years or more before we can really tell). 


6.	You wonder why the gulf coast states hate FEMA? In some places FEMA didn’t let people fix up their own property and move back in, but instead made them wait for years before they could return to their homes and qualified and well-equipped volunteers were stopped from evacuating people from places that FEMA wasn’t even evacuating because they weren’t approved or whatever. 


7.	The drug war isn’t working (yes, in addition to people who want to seal the borders, the support for ending the drug war is in the tea party as well as the far left). 


8.	Taxes suck and the tax burden is distributed weirdly.


9.	Government wastes sooo much money. To give you a fun anecdote, the feds built two roundabouts at a highway exit when I lived in CO as part of the national recovery and reinvestment act, and it cost 254 million dollars and took 2 years. They had signs proclaiming this with pride, like they were being so great helping create jobs and fix the infrastructure, but what we had before was fine—we found out later that the town just lobbied to have them built so they could save money on electricity and road repair by having the feds replace their only two stoplights and a pot-holey intersection with the roundabouts, plus the surrounding streetlights with solar-powered ones. Meanwhile 10 miles down the interstate the highway literally collapsed, cutting off I-70 completely.


10.	 The federal government attaches a bunch of things unrelated to highways or education if the states want to get their money, and can in this way overstep its bounds. We pretty much ignore the constitution as it is written rather than amending it, and it causes a whole lot of discord, because people can still read and usually when somebody doesn’t like something that the government does, it oversteps the letter of or simple interpretation of the constitution, since, given that we haven’t meaningfully updated it for about a hundred years, most things do. We need the rule of law, and that means that we need clearly defined bounds for the government to stay within. Our current mishmash of legislation from the courts mixed with overstepping from the executive and the legislature is a recipe for disaster and dissatisfaction amongst the populace (Corporations are people when it comes to campaign donations, which are now unlimited, and we can spy on the whole world and torture and detain innocent people forever without trial! Yay!). People still learn civics in school, and sometimes read history, and the way we do things now is sure as hell not the way things were set up, even though a bunch of the things that violate the constitution are done for a good reason, since, for instance, it hasn’t even been updated to address things like how we might want to regulate newfangled technology like radios. 


11.	 (this is two things) Little guys get screwed for polluting in stupid ways while the big fish get off scot-free. The most radical environmental plan by any candidate was actually proposed by a tea-partier and is backed by some of them. Specifically that it is illegal to poison anyone, so there should not be EPA allowable limits or corporate shield protection if you pollute, and you can’t mess up other people’s, or public, property without their permission—though they allowed that exceptions would have to be made in some way for airplanes flying overhead. This is supported, for example, in my ultraconservative hometown of Rome, GA, where the EPA’s regulations keep GE from having to cleanup all the PCBs they dumped everywhere, poisoning the water and the fish and the people and giving them brain cancer. As long as GE (which some years pays no taxes because of loopholes in the tax code) keeps 2 people working at the plant that they got tax breaks to outsource to Mexico, they don’t have to do anything to clean stuff up. Under the plan that many in the tea party promote, those assholes would have to clean that up, pay people’s medical bills, and pay the same taxes as the small companies that compete with them. If you aren’t going to give the little guy a break, at least make it fair, that would be a start. Right now you are punished for being small. 


12.	 Externalized costs. Right now the government picks up the slack for a lot of companies, allowing them to externalize their costs and burden the taxpayer, most especially with larger businesses, which gives an unfair advantage over smaller companies and competition. This is also true with meddlesome regulations. They contend that if this stopped, and the government gets out of all of this, we’d have a lot more jobs and the taxpayers would save a lot of money (the media never ever talks about the people that want to wean the country off of this, or devolve things to the states (discussed later), rather than just draconianly and shortsightedly cutting it completely and at once)


13.	 The states already do the implementation for a lot of federal programs. This extra federal layer adds a whole lot of inefficiency to the system and prevents innovation in the way these government services are delivered. Can we eliminate all or most of the federal oversight role to save 20% or more and maybe get some more effective programs? Maybe a compromise could be that the Feds could say, “states must have a program addressing X and it must serve X. How it is done we don’t care, so long as it gets done.” Rather than micromanaging and duplicating roles already filled at the state and/or local level, plus adding more. 


14.	Agriculture: the way the federal government is pushing agriculture wastes tons of money and is making us fat and sick and is poisoning the land and making it hard for small farmers to compete or get started. Most people still farming are getting really old and the way the gov’t is pushing things means that the young guys can’t get into the business or get experience. The rest of you guys besides the far left fringe are corrupt shills for big agra who sue farmers when their unwanted seed spreads to the farmer’s fields, and when they save seeds, something practiced by farmers since farming began, and which many view as a fundamental and essential right. Rich people who aren’t farmers get huge tax breaks for owning and investing in farmland and it drives up the cost (100% every few years lately). And then huge subsidies and cash payments if they have enough money to hire the lawyers and accountants to figure out how to get the subsidies and money to do what you have to in order to get the gov’t money. In my county, almost all of the subsidy money went to wealthy area families who with a couple of exceptions are not farmers (the disbursements are all published online). I went to private school with their kids and hunting with them on their land, and I know what their parents do for a living all day, and how their land is used. It ain’t for farming, or it is minimally so. They just own farmland. Nobody can afford the (literally) millions of dollars it would take to start even a small farm these days in a lot of places.


15.	It's estimated that we have over 12 million illegal immigrants the United States, most of whom come across our huge, porous southern border. Assuming that the government estimates about an illegal activity that tried to avoid the government eye are correct, that's about the same amount that live in the greater London area, and multiple times more people than live in scotland or Ireland as a whole. Most of these immigrants are unskilled laborers and are often or usually extremely uneducated. The tea party has at various times said that it's fine with some kind of amnesty/path to citizenship for people who are already here, provided that we actually deal with the border to do something to stem the tide of illegal immigration, citing the last time conservatives compromised under Reagan, where we got amnesty and not a whole lot else done about the problem (much like the budget increase compromise that happened around the same time that was conditional on future cuts that resulted in an increased budget but no cuts later). They have also indicated that they would be fine with helping Mexico (and other latin american countries) improve their economy, which as one of our largest largest trading partners would be beneficial to the United States economy as well as being extremely beneficial to the people of Mexico and latin america, because over half of them live in poverty (mexico says this is about 40% but their definition is $5/day and they do a bad job of keeping track of even that). Our job market for unskilled labor is already extremely depressed, and illegal immigration and the low wages south of us really hurt low-skilled american workers, especially minorities. They get called racist for pointing all of this out. Some of them are probably racist, but they largely have toe the line or get crucified. Also, a decent sized libertarian block of the tea party rank and file wants amnesty and to make the border more porous and demilitarized, rather than less. The movement is a fairly schizophrenic on this. The rest of congress is largely unwilling to compromise with them.


16.	Global warming: they really suck at dealing with this for the most part.


     You hear about the stupid things that the tea party does, but you never hear about all this stuff, which is more what the voters want than whatever baloney you usually hear on the news. I really dislike the way that they want to deal with at least half of it. But I sympathize with all of their complaints, and so do millions of other Americans.

     Ignoring all this stuff leads to more and more distrust, and it makes people get more radical. Do you ever wonder why so many people believe in conspiracies and/or have crazy views of what the government is actually doing/trying to do? Aside from the rare true (and usually unsuccessful) cases of hidden agendas in politics/government, it is because the only people that actually engage them are the people putting these things out there, and people feel disenfranchised to the point that the best explanation seems to be that there are evil forces trying to do (whatever it is they don't like). All ""the media"" does these days it seems like is set people off against eachother, and the national debate only ever seems to focus on stupid crap or maybe actually stuff that is important but that gets talked about in a stupid way: 


[sex stuff (abortion, gay marriage, who is sleeping with who, Putin is mean to gays [but no mention of our Saudi allies that will literally cut off their heads], whatever), what some athlete did or said (not important, get it off my news, and in fact, get it off espn too, it isn’t important to the game either), politically incorrect statements that are usually misinterpreted or are mistakes or are heartfelt but made by people who don't matter (who the fuck really cares or is surprised if Hank Williams said something racist?), unhelpful discussions about climate change (it is either: “OMG THE OCEANZ ARE GOING TO RISE 100 FEET TOMORROW AND WE’RE ALL GOING TO DIE!” or “IT SNOWED LAST WINTER SO LIBTARDS ARE LYING AND CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAX”), and violence (scary guns are scary, mooslim obama’s gonna steal mah guns [he can’t], random acts of crime in different places that shouldn’t be national news, shitty interpretations of what is causing some war somewhere, that Malaysian plane is still missing—aliens?).]

.

instead of being a debate about the actual important causes or aspects of these things:

.
	
[dealing with the shitty situations that cause people to want to get abortions, what does the state have to do with marriage anyway, kim kardashian doesn't matter, what is making people want to kill eachother (they’ll do it without guns if they can’t have them, maybe less, maybe more, but still lots and lots regardless of gun laws), why and how exactly global warming is or isn’t true/manmade (yes people get that CO2 is what is causing it supposedly, but how? They never actually say, you have to really dig to find out the mechanism by which this happens. Or in the case of people saying it isn’t because of human carbon emmissions, why not, scientifically? Don’t just say there is a consensus or there isn’t, actually treat the public like grown-ups and explain yourselves. Also, newsflash: all those trees we cut down and swamps we drained all over the world and the way we do agriculture? Yeah it’s impossible to fix things without addressing that, even if the whole world cut carbon emissions to zero. Maybe talk about that some outside of just in academia and greenie newsletters so that something realistic and truly useful can get done), what is actually the cause behind what is happening in Ukraine, why are we droning people exactly?, why do the terrorists want to kill us?, where did all the jobs go and what makes them come back (have some serious discussions moderated by someone with balls enough to call bullshit and a mind enough to think for themselves), etc. What does it say about America when Snowden has to hide in motherfucking Russia for defending the first amendment? ]



Plus much more. You can talk to literally anyone about these things and they’ll say, “yeah it would be great if these things got talked about.” And almost everyone can understand all of it, even if it takes a bit of explaining. Very few people are actually stupid, even though it might take a bit of pressing them to get them to think for themselves. I used to talk with high school dropouts all the time about these types of things and have useful and cogent discussions; it totally is possible. If you engage your average tea-partier or the left-wing equivalent, you can have a meaningful discussion about any of these things, and people will gravitate to good ideas and to truth, they just have to be able to hear about it. If things were discussed in a more in-depth manner, people would be better able to sift out the truth from the veritable sea of lies that they are presented with every day. Reach out to UKIPers if you don't like them, try to get the media to engage them if you in any way have that ability, but most of all, don't ignore them. If they didn't have something important to say, UKIP never would have formed.

Even now nobody thinks mental illness is a *good* thing, and for the good of society we still lock away mentally ill people *who commit crimes* (just generally in hospitals rather than prisons), but - although we still have a long way to go - our way of conceptualising and dealing with them as a society is radically different and less accusatory than a few hundred years ago.

Similarly, I suspect in the future we'll learn to deal with paedophilia the way we deal with any other paraphilia that isn't the subject of a society-wide taboo and hysteria - with understanding, acceptance, monitoring and treatment, and only condemning and locking people away for their *actions* rather than their orientation (which is entirely outside of their control).

Hell, given the evidence that [on average access to pornography actually *reduces* sexual crimes](http://www.yapaka.be/sites/yapaka.be/files/actualite/pornography-rape-and-the-internet.pdf) there's even an argument for legalising (or at least prescribing) access to child porn for such people, at least for computer-generated or artificially-constructed images to avoid creating demand or causing additional distress to abuse victims.

There are some good things about academies, but most of the good points could have been applied to existing schools without a costly and disruptive structural change. 

And DfE is rushing things through without spending time to do them properly. This leads to debacles such as the new KS1 and KS2 curriculae which were introduced without all the associated tests.
