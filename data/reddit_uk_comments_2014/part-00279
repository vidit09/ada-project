true,FlappyBored,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;But the comments and articles of the Scottish people seemed more calm and logical, while England comments and media leaned more towards 'We're better than they are!' and 'how could they?!' attitudes.

Absolutely ridiculous. Pro-Yes voters had far far more than there fair share of idiotic comments like .HURRR FK DA ENGERLISH NO RUN BY FOREIGNOR HURRR'. Even /r/Scotland do not make such a ridiculous claim such as this. 


&gt; know enough about the economy to choose England as one of my central bases. Why? Because I'm hoping the bankers won't shit in their own bed. Because I know the pound overrides the welfare of the people here, and that secures a better value for it. I definitely want my money and my pension in pounds. But being financially ahead due to a banking centre doesn't necessarily put a country on the economic cutting edge.

One of your 'central bases' ahahahaa, mate you run a poxy online store, probably shifting junk on Ebay or Amazon, you're hardly in a position to be making such ridiculous claims such as 'the UK is an economic backwater' or that the 'UK will fail in the future'.

Not to mention I directly proved how ridiculous your comments were in the last post, we're on track to be the second biggest economy in Europe by 2020 and the largest, overtaking Germany, in 2030. Yes, we're very much on the economic cutting edge, more than any other European nation.

Its you who needs to take a better look, you've clearly not even done the most basic of Google searches on it.

&gt;I'm just a traveler who's seen a lot of the world and I'm just pointing out something I observed.

Really? According to your posts you've been to about 3 or 4 countries, you're hardly Phileas Fogg. 


&gt;To be honest the roads in Johannesburg are decades ahead of here.

Another ridiculous claim that is blatantly false to anyone who has been to both countries. 'Decades ahead', don't be ridiculous. (hint I have too, you're not the only person who has been outside of the country,though I know its rare for Americans to travel). Roads are far superior here than to places like the USA where potholes are left open for months on end.

&gt;The plumbing in England is deplorable. You can't even have mixer taps or standard non-electric showers in many homes

Another absolutely absurd claim, you can get mixer taps in any house, its not exactly hard. Go talk to anyone who actually renovates houses, its simple. Electric showers are also cheaper and more economic which is why people have them, not because 'its impossible to get boiler heated showers in the UK'.


&gt;And the fact that, for this, they pay double what a nice, clean, roomy apartment in California might go for is just absolutely nuts to me. But that's the power of the pound again, and that's why my money is in pounds.


Ahahahaha, thats got nothing to do with the 'power of the pound' you idiot, its to do with the fact that California has tons of fucking land compared to the UK. Only a moron could miss out such a key fact when comparing why land is cheaper in one region than another.


Funny you mention California as well, isn't that the state thats about run out of water because they decided to live in a desert and for some reason just waste all their water on maintaining green lawns and now have massive emergency fines in place because there's literally no water left? Wow, USA is such an economic backwater lol.


Absolute ridiculous claims from you all round, the UK isn't an 'economic backwater' quite the opposite I'm afraid, we're one of the leading economies in Europe and were more than on track to stay that way and exceed any other nation in Europe to be the biggest and strongest in the next 20 years.

I can't say I disagree with that. But I do disagree with their approach in a big way. They're essentially putting disabled folk in the same boat as fully-capable people, and expecting them to thrive.

The way I see it is that there's something fundamentally wrong with the whole paid employment system. I know a lady who is mostly wheelchair bound (she can walk short distances with walking sticks). She has heart conditions, epilepsy and diabetes... for most, she would be considered completely unfit for work. However, she's been a member of a charity for probably about 20 years now... she's grown with them, and gotten involved in so much, that last year she was brought on as one of the UK's national team. She only goes in when she's feeling up to it, but when she does, she's like a mother to the whole organisation. A truly amazing woman.

I don't feel that absolutely everyone could do so well, especially in the employment market of today, but I do feel that it's largely down to the 'open door' approach the charity has. With no expectations and a highly supportive and dignified atmosphere, I feel that people of all walks of life can get a better chance to become more productive.

This is where the government's way of doing things falls flat. They assume that dignity has to be earned, and go round beating people with the proverbial stick, without giving adequate support, and ignoring the fact that nobody else is going to be giving adequate support.

true,wotusayin,null,null,"You people are unreal, you actually think you know more about football than Rodgers. It's almost like Rodgers knows that Gerrard's passing is vital to Liverpool and no other player you have can offer anything like it.

He also probably knows that Gerrard hasn't actually been responsible for any of the goals you've conceded. Gerrard is getting the blame for defenders making mistakes.

It really is incredible how quickly you've turned against him, for a community that acts like you all stick together.


He's had poor games because he can't get rid of his marker and has no time to pick passes. 

People don't realise that if the rest of the team were playing well, Liverpool could take advantage of the fact there's so much focus on stopping Gerrard, by moving Gerrard about and making use of the fact the other team are always one man down because he's stuck on Gerrard.

Just look at Agbonlahor and how he wouldn't leave Gerrards side when Liverpool were in possession, Gerrard got 0 time on the ball, but it also meant moving Gerrard about would move Agbonlahor with him and mess up the opponents shape. 

The fact Liverpool's left winger was so focused on Gerrard the whole game that there was a massive space, should've meant Borini had loads of room to take advantage of them, but he didn't. That is an area Sturridge exploits fantastically.


If Liverpool's defenders hadn't made big errors, you wouldn't have conceded goals, it was nothing to do with Gerrard. Most of your players are playing poorly and the other team has played better each game, but Gerrard gets the entirety of the blame. 

People also don't understand what Gerrards role is, and they aren't watching his individual performances. Gerrard is a player like Alonso, he doesn't make a huge number of tackles, but he cuts out passes before players make them, and starts attacks because he has a huge range of passing. Constantly making switching the play from one flank to another look effortless, that sort of stuff is huge for a team trying to break opponents down.

Yes. It's not only divided Scotland as a nation, but now we have the obvious feeling of some resentment of the English in our media.

&gt;We had a referendum because recently many people have been questioning if the status quo

I hope you have had a referendum for those reasons.

&gt;There wasn't any hate or racism. I don't care if you found it fun, it was important and needed to happen if the union is to go forward in a way that keeps everyone happy.

As someone who is half Scottish - I've felt first hand the resentment of Scots far north in my youth, of the English. Boys of 11 or 12 being horrid for the only reason being their parents held that resentment. To say there is no hate is wrong, where the yes vote comes from. I don't believe it was important and has become quite counter productive - my opinion could change in the years to come if Scotland does feel more unity now. But I doubt it...

true,shackleton1,eng-kent,Kent,"I'm afraid you're mistaken on two points.

Firstly, comparisons are generally made between Scotland and the UK as whole; not between Scotland and the remainder of the UK; simply because statistics for the UK as a whole are very easy to obtain, whereas statistics for the individual nations are more difficult to obtain and often don't even exist. They are, in that sense, somewhat dishonest in treating the oil differently.

Secondly, these assets *do not* count towards English, Welsh and Northern Irish revenues.

By and large, mining, broadcast licenses, mineral explotation and oil are licensed by national (UK) bodies. In most cases it's the Crown Estate, but there are exception (broadcast licenses are OfCom, coal is the Coal Authority).

I regard it as *highly unlikely* that anyone has ever divided these assets up according to their region. Certainly no one has done so for broadcast licenses (which would have a greater market value per capita in England than in Scotland) because the figures don't exist.

It's very easy to do the maths for one item in isolation; the oil. (Well, except that it's not - you have to make all sorts of assumptions about how it would be divided).

It would be an enormous, painstakingly detailed undertaking to work the regional worth of all the other bits and bobs; plus, as I said, figures for it probably simply don't exist.",0,1411328481,null,0,false,0,ckoncz2,t3_2gz91f,t1_ckoncz2,t1_ckny1t0,null,1426890554,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In another 13 years we'll still be able to talk about what a great player Lampard has been and it will be nothing more than an interesting little fact that Lampard briefly played for City before moving to MLS. 

The man was clearly quite conflicted and not happy about being on the pitch today, but he did his job and I can't possibly blame him for that especially given how he reacted. After scoring he looked like he hated himself and I think that tells us all we need to know about how he feels about Chelsea. So good for him that he's still scoring and let's just take our point and move on.

true,dontthrowstones,null,null,"&gt;a boundary was created to allow unionists to remain in the UK, this boundary incorporated areas that had voted for independence. To create an artificial majority is undemocratic. Scotland recently rejected independence Glasgow and the Highlands however voted for independence why shouldn't we create a new international border for them now if it's a perfectly democratic process. The creation of Northern Ireland perfectly meets the definition of gerrymandering as it included areas without a unionist majority while maintaining a unionist in NI as a whole. These areas were incorporated so that the Unionist areas could support themselves...again undemocratic.

Complete bollocks. The county borders were used by default when it became apparent Collins would actually lose parts of counties previously thought to be safe, but had been found by the boundary commission to hold unionist majorities, eg East Donegal. So the negotiated border came into being, with basic majorities on either side showing the border solution was a workable one.

Now about your assertion on artificiality. There is no such thing as an artificial majority when everyone had an equal right to vote. The majorities on either side were real and democratic, as proven by subsequent elections.

You bring up the point of Scotland 2014 as a counter argument to partition. (It was Dundee not the Highlands who were pro-separation). Neither side favour partition in any shape or form as a solution. In early 20th century Ireland you had two distinct camps who hated each other. Separation in some form was not only wise but inevitable.

&gt;Question: When is the will of the majority not democratic?

&gt;Answer: When you talk to /u/dontthrowstones about the history of NI. 

So home rule for nationalists is self determination, and home rule for unionists is gerrymandering.

Do you think unionists are fucking stupid when you come out with this shite? Do you?

And the case in point being that most of the Brits on here seem to be supporting police interaction, while the ""wtf being arrested for stuff you said on Twitter is fucking dumb"" comments are from Americans.

I wouldn't say I was completely free thinking, I'll have my own biases. I'd also note I don't think it's the best use of police hours chasing up keyboard warriors who get a kick out of upsetting people on Twitter or Facebook. As they say, haters gonna hate, and there have to be slightly more troubling people out there to be chased down instead.

At the same time though, I totally don't understand how a country can base it's ideals and legal system on a document that precludes the abolition of the slave trade, the invention of the telephone, internet, automatic weapons, nuclear warheads, etc. And why there's a near deified status of the people who wrote the constitution, and their purity of heart and wisdom and such that makes it so outrageous that any modern-day politician might try and contradict them. 

Wasn't meant to be personal (also see my edit), is just that I find the notion that the Constitution exists as an unquestionable and infallible piece of law and ideology to be massively irritating when it's brought up discussing politics or policing with Americans. Even if the current US laws are the best made and most just laws in the world, whether they abide by the constitution or not shouldn't make any fucking difference imo.

Mp's would be banned from hiring family members, unpaid internships would be banned and each MP would be given an allocation to offer paid work experience for people from disadvantaged backgrounds.

I would introduce minor reforms of the House of Lords intended to reduce the number of politicians. This would include limiting each party to a maximum of 10% and a significant increase in the number of technocrats and academics.

I would introduce English Votes for English Laws while devolving more power to the regions. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would be offered near full devolution. The Barnett Formula would be replaced by a new fund designed with the intention of fighting poverty.

I would also introduce a threshold, deliberately set at a high rate, by which referendums could be triggered.

""Frank Lampard is a Man City player,"" Mourinho told Sky Sports.
""When he decided to go to a direct competitor then love stories are over.""
The Portuguese coach added: ""I don't believe in stories of passion and heart, maybe I am too pragmatic in football. He did his job as a professional.""

""I feel that when a player leaves another club and plays for a direct opponent, he is not going there for a holiday, he is going there to try and beat his club - the one everyone considers the club of his heart, but not any more,"" Mourinho told BBC Sport.

""Maybe again [Chelsea will be in his heart] when he leaves City, but while at City he wants to beat Chelsea. That is the nature of football.""

1. Mourinho is pretty clearly not going after Lampard, calling him a professional.

2. The tweet makes this sound like a Mourinho vs. Lampard thing, when, if you read a little bit, it's more about Frank putting love of Chelsea aside for his current club, City, and doing what his job is, which is a professional footballer. Don't forget, it was Frank Lampard's **job** to play for us. It wasn't volunteer work. It's also his job to play for city.

3. It doesn't matter anyways because Jose the Manager is going to say whatever the fuck he feels he needs to say as a manager. It's calculated and probably doesn't represent his opinion. You're stupid to think so.

I didn't mean to downplay the social/development side, but some of the studies I was referring to actually seemed to show that social/development didn't make much difference either. So we actually have no idea why this is, we should study it more, and that was the point I was trying to make.

&gt;In fact ‘Northern Ireland’ did not demand self-determination, it was created to deny self-determination. ‘Northern Ireland’ was created and maintained through the threat of violence and denial of democracy. Its origin was a sectarian head-count as John Whyte explains : « For the border was so drawn as to corral within it not only almost all areas with unionist majorities, but also considerable areas with nationalist ones. If the county is taken as the unit, there were at the time of partition unionist majorities in only four of the six counties of Northern Ireland. If some smaller unit had been chosem then parts of Tyrone and Fermanagh might have been reclaimed for unionism, but considerable parts of other counties would have been lost to nationalism…(Unionists’) only worry was how much territory they would be able to control. The idea that it might be unjust to ask for more territory than was actually unionist apparently never entered their heads. The fact might be used by their critics to argue that unionists sought , not equality, but supremacy. » (John Whyte, Interpreting Northern Ireland, Oxford University Press, 1990, pp.163-164) On that basis, one can seriously challenge the idea that « there is nothing inherently reactionary about…a national frontier which puts Protestants in numerical majority. » (Paul Bew, Peter Gibbon, Henry Patterson, The State in Northern Ireland, Manchester University Press, 1979, 221)

The establishment of Northern Ireland did not occur through the will of the people but through the actions of the state. The entire island, country, of Ireland voted for independence and in the end they were denied the right of self-determination. This is history not my bias, this is your home and land as much as it is mine, you can be confident that the history, no matter how unjust, does not undermine the political position of unionism or yourself. However, you are bound to create tension when you willfully and insensitively deride historical fact because it does not conform to your outlook.

The formation of Northern Ireland was caused by the threat of violence and that legacy has caused much misery and suffering for so many, it was not wise and it was avoidable. 

There were a large number of unionists left on the other side of the border, does the Republic have problems anywhere near as bad as those we have? Seems to me that the only thing that maintained the 'hatred' is Northern Ireland.

And just so we're clear while I don't agree or identify with unionism I respect the rights of people to hold those views.

Catholics in Scotland have traditionally voted Labour because they thought they would be marginalised in an independent Scotland. They thought a Scottish parliament would be like a little Stormont, ie, dominated by Protestants... 

Regarding Irish republicanism, especially as it manifests today - there are no equivalent slogans to ""for god and ulster"" for example. There are no overtly Catholic Irish republican leaders in modern times, no equivalent of the Orange Order - a loyalist religious organisation. It's been more influenced by internationalism and socialism than the Catholic church. Sinn Fein for one seem to be a secular organisation and Wolfe Tone is a republican icon, also a protestant...

 [**At-will employment**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At-will%20employment): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;__At-will employment__ is a term used in [U.S. labor law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_labor_law) for contractual relationships in which an employee can be dismissed by an employer for any reason (that is, without having to establish ""[just cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_cause)"" for termination), and without warning.  When an employee is acknowledged as being hired ""at will"", courts deny the employee any claim for loss resulting from the dismissal. The rule is justified by its proponents on the basis that an employee may be similarly entitled to leave his or her job without reason or warning.  In contrast, the practice is seen as unjust by those who view the employment relationship as characterized by [inequality of bargaining power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_of_bargaining_power).

The Kaboul/chiriches pairing cannot/should not be our CB pairing, granting they have fast recovery skills they tend to go AWOL, and at crucial times.  
Dembele , if the teams expects to excel with him in the mid, he has to make more penetrating forward runs, his role is not to distribute the balls from the center to the wing, it's so predictable, the defence is already set for that when he has the ball, sure spread a few out to open up the defence, but you have to be prepared to run at them.  
Lamela, good work rate, needs some more premiership time to get better, reminds me of a slightly slower young CR7. He is quality, but he can't do it alone  
Eriksen suffering a sophomore slump (those familiar with fantasy baseball etc.) . Other teams are more prepared for him this year and he is less effective, hopefully he will find his form sooner rather than later.  
Adebayor, the team really needs to stop with this one striker crap, with that one striker being Ade. If you are playing pressing type football, you would want your striker sitting on the line of the last defender. He comes back too deep into midfield, and when he looks up he has to go through 2-3 defenders to get a shot @ goal, we either play 2 strikers, Ade excelled last year when playing with Soldado, which brings me to Soldado...  
Soldado, when you have someone on fire you run with them, Bobby was in good form during the preseason, what do we do when season starts, we bench him and play Ade who was coming back from malaria. That is confidence destroying, and it reflects on the opportunities he gets, he so wants to score so badly, he muffs the chances.  
If Poch wants to play high-energy pressing offence so far only rose, dier, lamela from this game exhibited those qualities.   
Lloris was good this game, did all that was asked of him.  
WTF is up with setpieces, our defence and execution of them are not top premier quality, thats a training ground issue.  
Fans knock holtby etc, but you can see from this performance why poch wanted  Schneiderlein and rodriguez  
The solution is not an easy or cheap one, we need another midfielder (trade either of or both paulinho/dembele) that runs at defences, plus a different striker (in-form soldado i would prefer)

It's all about being able to talk with all of your players and get them to perform as well as they can""

Agger: ""I think he is a great manager, you can't take that away from him. He's good in the way he trains the team and he is great at setting up the team. The things that went wrong between us is that I say things the way they are and I expect others to treat me the same way. Maybe it is wrong to always expect this""

Interviewer: ""You showed great loyalty to Liverpool FC. Did you feel that Rodgers wasn't loyal to you?""

The camera-work seemed off, the sound was muddied and when a newspaper ended up hitting Clara squarely in the head with a cartoon-style ""donk"" I wondered if it was all some cruel joke. I think it got better around the mid-point but yeah, not a great start.

Episode 3 was easily the worst episode since the reboot for me. Here we had this Doctor we barely knew and he was arguing like a child in a playground. Robin Hood was painful to watch throughout and needed to drop the irritating facade in the first 5 minutes rather than the last.

&gt; Episode 4 was half devoted to a romance I don't care about

This is the big problem for me.

I don't care about the new Doctor. Having discovered he didn't commit one genocide and avoided the genocide of his own people, he's for some reason more angsty than ever. We've had hints dropped about him recognizing himself in the first episode and asking Clara if he was a good person in the second, but they haven't been developed and neither has he. Okay, I get it, he's wearing this grumpy and cold exterior, but it's not proving problematic and it's not being explained, so I have no reason to care. I had a better idea of who Matt Smith was meant to be after his first episode than I do about Capaldi after his forth. There's nothing to make me care beyond the fact that I'm meant to.

The same goes for Clara. I don't care. She's a plot device that never got turned into a character. I'm pretty sure she qualifies for [Mary-Sue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Sue) status. I looked up ""Clara Oswald flaws"" on google and I got ""*clever, resourceful, determined, ambitious, bossy, flirty, selfless, persuasive, total control-freak, she loves children, is confident, brave, loves making souffles and doesn’t abandon the people she cares about.*""...So her flaws are supposedly bossiness and being a control freak, but neither of those have been anywhere near present enough to be either problematic or give her character. She's just too all-round ""good"". She was likeable as the souffle girl, but ever since? Nothing. Can't care, don't care.

Use &gt; in front of a line or paragraph.

&gt; I never said the Constitution was infallible, you're arguing a straw man. 

Again, never said you said that, talking generally. Wasn't actually relevant to any of my points that I was directly making against you anyway.

&gt; I also don't know how you plan to discuss American politics and government without referencing the set of rules we have chosen to use to govern ourselves.

Referencing them is fine. It's when they apparently become the be all and end all of the argument that it becomes massively irritating. Take the issue of gun legalisation - if people want to talk impact on crime stats, how you'd actually go about implementing a ban on weapons when a huge proportion of people already own them, on whether it's treating the core social issues behind homicides or just removing a secondary thing... I'd be all for that debate. But you get so many people who wouldn't even enter the debate because 2nd Amendment says guns are fine, and apparently the Constitution is a trump card.

Obviously you have to reference the existing set of rules when debating politics, government, or what changes to laws might be. But it's impossible to have a debate on what laws and policies would be the best when some people sanctify the Constitution and Bill of Rights to the point where they're above debate. 

Fundamentally the Constitution shouldn't be seen as any different to any other laws that exist in the world - they exist and while they exist people should abide by them, but they're not beyond question or calls for change. Laws should change as the world we live in changes, as technology and society changes, and it just seems totally weird that a government today has almost no power to change or remove laws that a government 300 years ago had the power to make. Something being unconstitutional should be a sign that it need to be highly examined and a debate on whether the constitution is correct needs to be had. Instead ""unconstitutional"" a lot of the time is just synonymous with ""wrong and shouldn't be allowed in law"".

And if you get that, fine, I wasn't even saying you didn't. But in my experience a huge amount of Americans don't and that was the point I was originally addressing. ",0,1411332686,null,0,1411332991,0,ckopn2o,t3_2h1iea,t1_ckopn2o,t1_ckooxx4,null,1426889478,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Slightly less realistic: Reform the House of Lords, not to be elected but be independently appointed former politicians, scientist and experts in fields from welfare to religious leaders. The reason is I think the House of Lords does in fact serve very well as a stop and check for bills. I have watched the process and seen many bills be rejected on grounds of important features being omitted or negative effects in certain groups (such as the disabled). I think that is it's best feature and rather than electing it and give it more power, that could simply cause more red tape, I would like to see its role as basically a house of proofreading  built upon rather than demolished. 

Completely unrealistic: Remove devolution from cultural lines and place them along economic and geographic needs (e.g. the Highlands and Islands are rather distinct in their needs from the Scottish central belt). Have all these referred to as parliaments and all members within simply considered Members of Parliament or MPs. These MPs will take not only a seat in their regional parliament but will also be those that sit in a reformed House of Lords (it could be renamed) and will have powers to review bills presented by the House of Commons as well as present bills to the House of Commons. They will not, however, have the ability to force through a bill or permanently stop one. The House of Commons will no longer have MPs but will simply be UK Ministers (UKM) have a set number of seats in the house that are filled based on proportional representation. The Party with the highest number of UKMs will elect the Prime Minister. Any bills put forward by the PM can be passed by the House of Lords should the House of Commons reject it, hopefully aiding in reducing squabbling based on party lines.

Fife had a surprising amount of people who turned up at polling stations to vote, only to find they were marked as having requested (and used) a postal vote.  The ones I'm aware of had never requested a postal vote in the first place.

This happened in at least Kirkcaldy and Dunfermline (and possibly Lochgelly or Cowdenbeath - not sure).

Before 5pm they were able to drive to Cowdenbeath and get another form, allowing them to vote.  After 5pm they were basically screwed.

Pretty sure that's why the Fife vote came in so late - sorting out the mess of postal votes that were superseded by normal votes.

Rose: Becomes Bad Wolf god entity, lives happily ever after with Doctor clone and is put on a pedestal despite having some serious character flaws.

Donna was destined to become half timelord, then being forced to become ""normal."" Probably best handled one, personally.

Amy had reality-crack powers and was mother to the Doctor's ""wife."" 

As for Clara.. Where to start.

First time we meet ""her"" she was so brilliant that INSANE DALEKS decided to go against their most primal urge and turn her into a dalek. (Personally, I would have had an insane Dalek absorb her mind through the plunger so it could think it wasn't a Dalek. Not because she was super special, but just because she was there. Her brilliance comes from her being a Dalek.)

Then we have the whole leaf being more important than the doctor's stories. (I know there's some BS explanation but it comes across as leaf&gt;1000+ years traveling time and space.)

Then we have her not just saving the doctor, but saving the Doctor through out his timeline and is pretty much retconned into every single story ever.

And now she's gone back to when he was a little boy and influenced him to be the man he is, therefore the entire series, old and new, is completely thanks to this one girl who is important because the plot says so.

My favorite companion was Rory. At least his unique property, being a roman for two thousand years guarding a box, took some effort and he earned the right to be special.

I'm ok with the new Doctor though. He's a welcome change from the youngsters and he's fundamentally the same character as before.

true,hi-BoB,null,null,"I worked as a journalist in NI for a few years.

So this was say three years ago. Was working away; investigating some church fete and I got an email through from Sinn Fein. One of their MLAs was getting all uppity that Castlereagh Borough Council wasn't employing enough ""Catholics""; not Irish people or republican people. Catholics. 

I used to work in Castlereagh Council as a life guard. They were right. There wasn't 50/50 equality, but there were a few Catholics who worked where I worked, and it wasn't like it was an actual issue to be moaning about.

I thought they were making a mountain out of a molehill because Castlereagh is a mostly Protestant Unionist area in south east Belfast and the whole council is unionist. You'd have to be going out of your way to be pissed about it. And start bussing people in from miles away probably. 

So I decided to be a dick and I asked Paddy (His name was Paddy) the SF press officer: ""Well; how many Protestants do Sinn Fein employ?""

..... And he had a bit of a meltdown and started telling me to ring the HR dept, even though I was asking him to do that for me, and mouthing off about how the DUP probably didn't employ Catholics and how I should go and ask them the same question and how you had to be from a republican background and therefore probably Catholic..... He was a proper cunt and highlighted to me quite clearly that SF press office is a propaganda machine, just like all the rest of them. It's not out for actual social justice; just protecting its own. 20 years ago it was protecting catholics, today it protects socialists. 

And the story went nowhere because it was just bullshit SF stuff. 

Sinn Fein pick and choose when to be socialists and when to be Catholics, and when to look like martyrs and when to revel in terrorism. 

And the more Ireland secularises the more they move in that direction. SF today is more secular than it was 15 years ago. It's not as secular as it will be in 15 more. I'm all for moving with public opinion, but I like convictions too. 

My point about the song was to clarify if you were being a hypocrite or if you still hold that all sectarianism must be religious. And you clarified the latter.

true,guyintheuk,eng-shropshire,Shropshire,"As an English resident I can only give a personal opinion. Before the referendum the Barnett formula was something we English knew about vaguely but accepted as a fact of life. We also knew (and slightly resented) the fact that Scottish students did not pay tuition fees. 

However, during the independence debates we had 'Better Together' spokespeople standing up to tell the Scots how lucky they were that they were being subsidised by 1200 each and that was what they would loose if they voted for independence. Is is any wonder that the rest of us thought that is unfair and they should not get preferential treatment at all - never mind all the extra that were being offered as a bribe to stay with us.

If the Scots had voted for independence then this would not have been an issue. We could have two members of the family on good terms but living independently. 

However, now that the Scots have decided to stay in the union for the supposed benefits that bring, is it any wonder that there is resentment that they will not be bearing their fair share of the costs.

It is not the Scots I resent, it is the unequal (preferential) treatment they are receiving (at the expense of the rest of us) by our UK government. 

As for the extra powers that were offered to the Scots - not only did I get no say in that, neither did my representative in Westminster. 

Everyone was saying a Yes vote would lead to problems between Scotland and England but I was always of the opinion that a NO vote would cause the greater difficulties. ",0,1411334565,null,0,false,0,ckoqkfs,t3_2h133y,t1_ckoqkfs,t3_2h133y,null,1426889045,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

We didn't pressure them which yes allowed them time on the ball, but what did they do with it? They didn't break us down until that late goal because it's hard to face a team who's mentality is "" Ok, we'll sit back and counter you, try to break us down ""

Desperately defending? We conceded a goal at the 85th minute away to a team who like us, score for fun sometimes. How on earth do you say that's desperate defending?

&gt;

&gt;A __straw man__ is a common type of [argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_argument) and is an [informal fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_fallacy) based on the misrepresentation of an opponent's argument.  To be successful, a straw man argument requires that the audience be ignorant or uninformed of the original argument.

&gt;The so-called typical ""attacking a straw man"" argument creates the illusion of having completely refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition by covertly replacing it with a different proposition (i.e., ""stand up a straw man"") and then to refute or defeat that false argument (""knock down a straw man"") instead of the original proposition.  

&gt;This technique has been used throughout history in [polemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polemic) debate, particularly in arguments about highly charged emotional issues where a fiery, entertaining ""battle"" and the defeat of an ""enemy"" may be more valued than [critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking) or understanding both sides of the issue.

true,kittysaysmeownow,null,null," You are spinning your articles again mr.FlappyBored!  

When you paraphrase you should not use quotation marks. I believe my quote that you are attempting to refer to is:

""...In the mean time, if I were Scotland, I would be running. They have an opportunity to move forward here. Otherwise, they'll be stuck in the (sorry) economical and technological backwaters for a long time to come...""

I know it's difficult for you to keep things in context, but lets just try to write above the level of poorly quoted tabloidism. 

In reference to to your articles (for the love of God- you could have omitted the telegraph one!), I've already agreed with you that London is a major financial centre and the pound will not be falling any time soon. That's why I've invested in it, and we've been over this.

My point is that this is only sustainable if the infrastructure around it does not crumble. Even your 4th article states the following: 

''The UK's economy is set to overtake that of France by 2020 to become the second largest in Europe, according to forecasts by consultancy firm PwC.

It says the UK's value is aided by the strength of the pound against the dollar compared with that of euro, together with falling unemployment.

But it says the UK lags behind in areas including education, investment, trade deficits and income inequality.

Germany comes top in Europe and fourth globally after the US, China and Japan.

India is set to overtake the UK by 2030, also rising above Germany and Japan to become the world's third largest economy.'' (have you even read these?)

But none the less, I agree with you that London is a financial powerhouse. 

Economy is not measured only by the market, or foreign investment (like the foreign fracking companies investing here for example), or predictions that may or may not come to fruition. It takes all of those things (which are highly variable) and compounds them into a general state of being. Another part of that state of being is a country's infrastructure. These articles only tell you the numbers, they don't tell you the whole story.

 If you have shit infrastructure, you're never going to match the living standards of say, Germany, for example. You see, they have *both* infrastructure *and* financial viability. England's got the financial bit, thanks to the banking centre of London, but it's allowed everything else to slip.

Despite using the pound for my own benefit I have no intention of living here long term. I'm just running a business here because your local lack of competition makes my job easy. I also like the currency exchange because my pounds will be more valuable elsewhere, and I can get much more for them elsewhere then I could ever get here. So I am taking your money, using some of it in England to keep things running, but I'm not putting all of it back in, and despite paying taxes, I'm still taking the leftover profits out of the country.

 You are, in fact, inviting people like me to do this by maintaining the pound at all costs, and the whole system has been set up this way for the advantage of many international financial institutions. On the wayside it benefits those who see the opportunity to capitalize on the pound like myself. 

So you might say I'm 'investing' here (because I source most of my stuff locally), or 'paying taxes and contributing' or I'm 'creating jobs', which are all true, and you could say that's great for the economy! But in reality I'm taking my personal profits out of the country to spend elsewhere, and that money will never see England again. 

That's why you can't just rely on these numbers alone and you have to look at the general state of the country, it's infrastructure, and it's living standards. The numbers only tell you so much. The standards tell you more. 

Not that it's all doom and gloom, but you do need to get with it on the technological/infrastructure side of things to keep it up, and my original opinion was that Scotland would be able to get with those much more quickly on its own. 

Also, apologies for the delay in response. My internet cut out again due to an infrastructure problem with my area's internet :-(",0,1411336355,null,0,false,0,ckorf1q,t3_2h133y,t1_ckorf1q,t1_ckonpzw,null,1426888650,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

As they're sold in packs of five (same with doughnuts), they should be cooked in multiples of five.  Of course, sometimes people can't count (or put more than they're meant to on a tray and find a few left over at the end*) and other times people will drop one on the floor and be left with four that they can't sell.  They then have one of two choices:

1. log all five as waste and put them in the disposals bin, or leave four that didn't fall on the floor in the canteen for staff to munch on (depends on how the manager feels ... some don't like this as they believe it gives bakers an incentive to mess up in order to get free cookies and doughnuts later);

2. bin the one that fell on the floor and whistle nonchalantly to oneself, while looking away and dropping an extra one into four other packs.

Since we have daily targets for wastage, if you go with option 1, your waste is going to be recorded and rise, which is something your store manager, regional manager and, potentially, head office will take note of.  If you go with option 2, they will most likely go unnoticed, at least in the short term.  You can't take the piss, though.  Large discrepancies between what the stores order for the bakeries and what they sell will be noticed and it is common for stores to get into trouble for under-reporting waste from the bakery.

You see what you want to, I suppose. Choose a 'side' and you can find any number of people supporting it somewhere around here.

&gt; There's a certain segment of posters that will go to any lengths necessary to take away blame from the Pakistani rape gangs and the Labour officials who protected them, because accepting it happened would disturb their vision of a multicultural paradise wherein minorities are never to blame...

Personally, I would like to know where these (large?) groups of people are who are happy for kids to be raped so long as no-one gets the chance to even think a thought that might be considered racist. I won't hold my breath. If such people do exist (and of course I will acknowledge that any fringe belief will have at least a handful of adherents) then I imagine you'd have a hard time getting them to equal the numbers of the average EDL/BNP rally. To be clear: they'll number close to 'a shade under fuck all in the grand scheme of things'.

Let's be clear again: You're arguing that there's a not insignificant number of people on here (in the country too?) who will go for the ""Shhhhh! Don't be racist: all not-white-people never do anything wrong and if you say otherwise you're well racist!"" option over ""Maybe we should stop these kids being raped."" I think that says far more about your mindset than the people you claim 1) exist and 2) are doing the above.

First things first. I would ban political parties. I don't like how the whip works nor do I like the short-termism that parties bring. They bring in shit individuals under the party banner and then pressure them to vote how they want. You might as well elect marionettes.  
Instead I would construct a government website based on potential policies which politicians or even the general public might upload proposals on how to change the country. 
This will create a currency that the public and politicans can speak in that isn't stupid parties or colours and actually means something instead.  

e.g.

&gt; I stand on environmentalism (ref: 22463) and decriminalisation of drugs (ref: 00001).  

I would then permit politicians to stand on any and as many proposals as they like to gain election from the public.    

While we're speaking of election people will vote based on candidates that support the policies that they agree with most closely. ""Wasted votes"" (FPTP) will then go into a pool based on the combinations of policies chosen and 1/2 of our MPs will be voted in based on the % of those votes for these policies and the nearest match. Tie breakers (for the politician list) decided on geographical proximity to votes that match their policies and then a coin flip.... because fuck working that shit out if it gets more complex.  

Every parliament will be a hung parliament and that is absolutely fine. Politicians will vote in the *civil servants* that will take the various portfolios. Politicans will *merely* decide and debate policy. None of them will be shaking hands with world leaders because that isn't their job. The cabinet (civil servants) will merely perform their role as per current law and policy dictates.  
If you want a job running the economy or being foreign minister then go work for the civil service and fucking study for it cause we shouldn't let uneducated political twats run our country.

Oh btw, I forgot to add. *We do elections monthly*.  You can be voted in one month and out the next if the people don't like you.  
Voting is optional. Postal or international votes are *prohibited*, residency is not a requirement to vote. This does mean that tourists can vote, I don't have a problem with this.  
This is because votes will be electronic and collected in real-time *using geographical location as identity* transmitting the votes over local (not connected to the internet) networks (possibly ad-hoc ones) to local counting stations. The results will be available to all to view and occasional audits will occur based on the geographical co-ordinates to determine whether the number of the votes from a given location is sensible (to prevent stuffing).  
My desires here are to make elections ""cheap"" so anyone who wishes to fuck with the outcome requires *a massive and* **sustained** investment to forge election results and even this can be discovered at a later date and then quashed.  

A public referendum will be held twenty years from the date of these changes allowing the public to revert them should they choose.  ",0,1411339018,null,0,1411340395,0,ckoso6s,t3_2h1zw7,t1_ckoso6s,t3_2h1zw7,null,1426888064,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

* For daytime food I recommend Thyme &amp; Co. It's the best cafe in Ballycastle IMO. They also do great pizzas on Saturday nights. It's beside an old style sweet shop ""the sweetie jar"" and a play park which would be good for the kids!
* There's a market at the seafront on the last Sunday of each month - local food and crafts.
* Rathlin is a great opportunity to see puffins and seals! Ferry goes quite regularly.
* My favourite walk is the road from the beach over to Marconi's cottage. The sunset there is amazing but if you go earlier it would be safe to nip down to the adjacent rock pools so the curious kids can see the rock crabs etc.
* You could spend a day climbing the nearby big hill ""Knocklayde"". The surrounding forests are pretty nice too if you don't fancy the climb.

The law is pretty clear at drawing the line between hate speech and racism and things which cross into the political spectrum. There have been plenty of people in the UK who have said things in a political forum that most would probably construe as racist (plenty related to the BNP, UKIP, some stuff George Galloway has said recently...) and they haven't been charged even though it would arguably blur the line. 

But if you're really trying to suggest that calling Balotelli a monkey or saying he should go back to Africa (despite being from Italy) has some deeper political sentiment behind it then you're welcome to elaborate. I see the point, but saying making hate speech illegal eventually leads to all free speech becoming illegal is like saying laws against heroin or cocaine are just a stepping stone to the government eventually banning things like alcohol and caffeine. And you've got to have *some* trust in the people you elect to run your country.

&gt; By the way, Christopher Hitchens was on my side of this argument, and he was pretty smart.

My family have English,Scots and Welsh backgrounds so a thoroughly British mix.
I suppose I was always really a patriotic Brit, that the union was great but now I'm older and have begun to see the corruption and rot that sits at the heart of the union, the class system, the establishment's hatred of any notion of working class Brit's moving beyond their station. I realize the union is nothing more than a tool and extension of the the old imperialist mindset.Divide and conquer, domination and exploitation of the many for the few, based on some odd belief based on an hereditary principle.


If it was truly a family of nations we would have had a federation a long time ago,meeting as equals but anything that upsets the centralized power of our country and the old elite that reside there seems to be resisted at all costs,  this country is not the meritocratic, freedom loving , united country I thought we were.
rentierism is returning in a big way, inequality is out of control compared to our peers, social mobility which is already pretty dire is becoming non existent, the first past the post is a terrible system for voting, I could go on and on the thing is we have many problems with our society but we seem to just completely ignore them and accept it meekly. 
Basically, we are, as all empires have done before us, declining and the YES vote is a clear example of this. I support self determination over false patriotism and love of a political construct (the union) why love a ""country"" that does not love you? not that it ever was a country, just a political union. I have no attachment to a flag, or the remote and corrupt leaders that work for it.
I would welcome another inevitable referendum and love to see regionalism or balkanization come to the union so that common people may run their own affairs in their own local areas for their own needs and they would find that with regional government they would have a much,much more accountable government.
This would engage voters, as we saw in scotland with the high turn out, instead of the continuing trend we see pf low participation and voter apathy, no doubt a result of the detachment the majority of people have with our centralized style of governance.

In the event of a Tory-UKIP coalition, we would have a referendum on the EU, then UKIP MPs would dissolve into the Tory backbench. 

I also think it would cause a lot of anger towards Westminster. Many felt betrayed when the Lib Dems went into coalition with the Tories, and parties like UKIP took advantage of this disaffection. A coalition would probably see the end to their mainstream support (like what happened to the Lib Dems but worse), and would get a lot of criticism for the Tories, who will have been allowed to run the country for 10 years without a majority.

Borini can do that work but he's not on the same sort of level as Sturridge both in ability and strength which limits his effectiveness. Gerrard being at the age he is now means we lack the mobility another team would have in midfield. That's not necessarily the issue as other teams do similar and have no trouble. 


Quite simply, we're not making defences work hard enough right now whether it be from runs from midfield or having a striker trying to get in behind. That makes it easy for them to bed in and stay compact. If you look at how City create chances at their best, it's like clockwork. Players know when and where to make runs to make space.

The problem for me is that he is being easily man marked, this stops us from playing the ball out quickly, so teams can easily press us and prevent us from moving the ball to our front players. When teams do sit off, they sit in their defensive shape and don't let us have any room. Allen coming back will help as he uses the ball very intelligently and is willing to accept it in tight areas.

Defensively I have been disappointed in him because he was good in that respect vs Spurs. A lot of it has to do with fatigue, he couldn't keep up with West Ham's attackers and get across to danger quickly enough. 

He is still valuable, but we have to become less reliant on him as he's far too old to be playing 3 games in 7/8 days. People forget it but he is by far our most accomplished passer, especially from deeper positions, the only one really capable of playing those 20/30 yard balls to our attackers between the lines. 

We have to find a solution. Obvious choice is to simply replace him with Lucas to improve defensively, but we'll still have problems in circulating the ball forward quickly. Allen could do it, but he is often bullied off the ball and lacks experience in that role. Can could do it, but we've yet to see him there.

The wide players are encouraged to stay forward so that the attacking team have to leave players back to compensate but it's just not working. We're getting bombarded with shots that could be defended if we had some sort of defensive shape but we don't. Teams are coming at us with only 6 players back when it should be at least 8. It's the reason we conceded late against Leicester and it's the reason we conceded against Arsenal. 11 goals conceded at home in 3 games is fucking embarrassing and we need to sacrifice some of attacking play for the time being to sort it out as it's costing us points that we shouldn't be dropping in any circumstance.

I can't be bothered to go through the hundreds upon thousands of examples of great CB pairings who have both used the same foot. Why on Earth should it make a difference? If which foot they prefer kicking with has such a marked impact on their game I don't want them in the team anyway.

Surely a minimum wage increase is great in the short term, because everyone at the bottom gets more money. But the kind of people working in minimum wage jobs are cleaners, supermarket workers, labourers etc, so wont the cost of these services/associated products increase if it costs more to hire people to do those jobs?

And aren't the people who would be most affected by a price increase be people on the minimum wage? In short, don't the benefits cancel out the costs? Considering *most* of the people working in these jobs will not be employed by the government, is this effectively an indirect way of taxing consumers? (i.e. a consumer pays more for a service in order for an employee to be paid more, which means the government gets more tax revenue).

The whole thing seems a bit convoluted with many parameters to consider, I can't actually tell if this would be a good thing in the long term, or if this is a ploy to win votes.

You pledged £6 a month. This guy needs to get 17 people to sign up in order for the charity to break even. That is not an entirely unreasonable in 16 hours work; frankly you might expect a bit more.

Also, he probably doesn't work for UNICEF. He works for a call centre who have a contract with UNICEF - that is the way most telephone fundraising work, with the except (iirc) of Amnesty International, who have their own call centres. The call centre almost certainly has other contracts with other charities, and potentially commercial enterprises as well. So the money to pay this guy will come from the call centre's finances, not the charity's. The call centre makes ITS money from the charities, and the money they use is in donations, but it's not like your six quid a month is going directly into the pocket of someone in an office in Birmingham. UNICEF is a worldwide operation with multiple revenue streams all over the world. There's no way to say what happens to YOUR individual six pounds every month; you can't attach a note saying ""please put this money in the pile to be used to buy medicine and blankets and not the pile to be used for fundraising"". Fact is if they didn't spend any money on fundraising, they'd have a lot less funds - it would be nice if we could solely rely on volunteers but sadly that isn't realistic.

Minmum repayments are the minimum amount you have to pay each month. If you have a balance on the card, regardless of the interest rate, you have to pay a minimum amount off each month. It is usually a fixed number/percentage of balance, whichever is lower sort of deal.

The working placement would look good, as you could put your income considerably higher than most students. I had zero percent deals through university with Nationwide and Barclays, but I have had and utilised a credit card since I was 18.

Can I suggest you ask to maximise your overdraft and treat that like a 0% credit card (should you be rejected from a 0%)?

1.) Those numbers don't take into consideration tax revenue from oil.

2.) Holyrood gets to set priorities, it chooses free university over free college. It's not necessarily spending 'free subsidy money', it's diverting money.

3.) It just costs more to provide the same in Scotland due to geography + low population density.

To expand on 3, you say *unequal* treatment. If we assume for a moment that Scottish NHS and English NHS offer comparable services then we have to assume that increased cost in Scotland is required to maintain that level.

If you cut funding to Scotland you force cuts in services, now people in Scotland pay the same tax as everyone else in the UK but don't get the same services for it. Purely because they happen to live in a place where providing those services is more expensive.

Watch some of our general play from the Spurs game and how easily we moved the ball from Gerrard into the midfield and towards Balotelli/Sturridge. That isn't happening now because we move the ball slowly and struggle to play through teams.

I am awfully lazy otherwise I'd create a diagram that showed what West Ham did, Sakho and Valencia split onto the two center backs, Downing marked Gerrard.

However, while I agree with the concern, I'm not sure we would get to the Leeds/Wimbledon stage. We had a huge crop of good players at once, and looking at who we sold, the only ""top"" players sold were Lallana and Lovren. Shaw was good, lots of potential, but equally had his faults, so 30m was worth it by a mile. Chambers the same, he didn't see his future at the club, fair enough, just bad timing on that part.

Lambert again, was his dream move, couldn't say no to him, and he was only going to be a squad player this season anyway, which no fan wanted to really see from a heart point of view, but it'd have been the smart thing to do.

Our board seem committed, and Liebherr seems to have found her love for the club, from recent reports, and business done so far. I mean, personally if I was, as a fan, in-charge of Southampton, and I had who I had come to me asking for transfers, I'd have let them go to. Rather have players who want to play for us. Those 2 clearly didn't, Chambers went about it the right way, and we had Clyne and McCarthy, Turnbull and Stephens, so fair enough. Lambert, again, easy decision. Lallana would have been the only one I called into question, however, I would have held his loyalty over the years into account for his wish to play Champion's League, which we knew we wouldn't get for several years, so fair enough.

Taking that into account, we sold 3 first team players, yeah, still not ideal, but it's the number a lot of us put on this summer. When you do so well in a single season and don't have anything to show for it, it was bound to happen.

Now we are under a new era, these players now have been brought in with a vision of moving forward. Just gotta wait and see how it pans out. Hopefully we aren't an **immediate** stepping stone for Koeman and Tadic, if we aren't all *should* be well for a few seasons to come, and I can't even predict where we'll finish/who we'll sign/who will dpeart.",0,1411343362,null,0,1411343651,0,ckoupqv,t3_2h2r2k,t1_ckoupqv,t3_2h2r2k,null,1426887110,2,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,2

false,timms5000,null,null,"RTD said DW wouldn't have been able to come back without Buffy so yes...that's where the idea for season arcs and more focus on the characters came from during RTDs run.

""AVC: Did you have other shows in mind as models for what you wanted to do? 

RTD: Well, every well-written show, really. I mean, I loved what Joss Whedon did with Buffy The Vampire Slayer, obviously. ""

“[Buffy the Vampire Slayer] showed the whole world, and an entire sprawling industry, that writing monsters and demons and end-of-the world isn’t hack-work, it can challenge the best. Joss Whedon raised the bar for every writer—not just genre/niche writers, but every single one of us.”

here's some more fun connections:

* Both Doctor Who and Buffy also have a spin-off, darker in tone, in which an immortal protagonist moves to a city and protects the public from things they often cannot comprehend, Torchwood and Angel.

* The Cardiff rift was a plot generator for series 1 and 2 of Torchwood, in the same way that the Hellmouth is in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

* In the Buffy episode ""As You Were"", the character ""Spike"" uses the alias ""The Doctor"" when breeding and planning to sell a species of dangerous demons.

* In Assimilation^2, Rory Williams uses his knowledge as a Roman Centurion to bluff two guards into allowing him to pass, a tactic also used by Xander Harris in the episode Innocence. Like Rory, Xander also received his knowledge after an alternate 'existence' as a soldier.

* Series regular Anthony Stewart Head, who plays Rupert Giles, has many connections to Doctor Who. He guest starred in School Reunion and The Infinite Quest, as well as various Big Finish Productions audio dramas. He also narrated Doctor Who Confidential and Project Who. He has often been reported as a potential candidate for the role of the Doctor.

* Recurring star of the series Juliet Landau has also portrayed an incarnation of companion Romana in several audio adventures.

* It has been acknowledged that some of the dialogue in School Reunion, such as Finch's line ""ignore the shooty-dog thing,"" was inspired by the style of writing used on Buffy.

* Russell T Davies has mentioned that the Buffy episode ""The Zeppo"" was an influence on the Doctor Who episode Love &amp; Monsters. Similarly, Buffy creator Joss Whedon expressed admiration for Russell T. Davies while speaking as part of the Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog panel at the 2008 Comic-Con.

* The season 6 episode of Buffy,""Smashed"", references the series when Andrew mentions he has seen ""every episode of Doctor Who.""

* James Marsters, who played the vampire Spike in both Buffy the Vampire Slayer and its spinoff Angel, played Captain John Hart in Series 2 of Torchwood. The two characters had a number of similarities in personality as well.

* The Angel episode A Hole in the World features a pit that extends all the way through the Earth, between England and New Zealand. Miracle Day has a similar feature called the Blessing, which extends between Shanghai and Buenos Aires.

* On the Torchwood website, one of the creatures described by Owen Harper as being in stasis in the Torchwood morgue is the ""Invincible Vampire"", which reconstitutes itself after it is ""dusted"". ""Dusted"" is terminology from Buffy for the slaying of a vampire.

Well, the gang is invited to see the Doctor (1200 y/o) get shot by an impossible astronaut at Lake Silencio, and the Gang later finds out that the Doctor (907 y/o) has also been invited. He agrees to investigate 1969 and discovers the Silence have occupied the entire globe for much of human history, getting them to build equipment, but the real reveal was that they had gotten humans to build a space suit that can sustain a young child with insane powers. After the Silence have been ""defeated"" we learn that the child actaully can regenerate, ergo she is a time lord

Later, we discover that Amy was a flesh body psychically controlled by her dreams at Demon's Run, and has been captured sometime between series 5 and 6 (as we can see Madam Kovera spying on her while she sleeps during the first episodes), her child effected by the Time Vortex, and they track her down all the way to Demons Run where they find out that Amy's daughter was actually Riversong of whom Kovera and the Silence have kidnapped and taken to the childrens home we found her in in the first episode (where she was then raised as a weapon to kill the Doctor.)

Then, Amy and Rory find out that thier childhood best friend was actually their daughter Riversong (who grew up going to school with them to ensure they ended up together, else she would never have been born), and was a psychotic adventure seeker who ended up attempting to kill Hitler (and the Doctor). We are here introduced to the Tesseract, a device that replicated the outside apearance of anyone in thier databanks. The Doctor is poisoned and Riversong (currently known by Mel) realizes who she is and how important she is to the doctor (and how important he will be to her in the future) that she uses her own regenerative capabilities to restore him, however the Doctor also uses the Tesseract's databanks to discover that Riversong is eventually the one that kills him at Lake Silencio, a fixed point in time that must happen. We are also intorduced to the fact that the Silence are not a race, but a religious order bent on murdering the Doctor before he can say his name at Trenzalor, summon Gallifrey, and start the Time War over again ending the universe (see Time of the Doctor)

Towards the end of the season, Riversong is visited by Kovera who tells her she's never been alone, and the Silence have been wathcing her her entire life, they stun her, trap her, and force her into the suit that was designed to kill the Doctor.We now find outselves back at LAke Silencio with the now 1200 year old doctor (who has spent the last 200 years running form his fate, and has inivted Amry, Rory, Eric, and the Doctor (907)) who finds the impossible astronaut (Riversong captured by Kovera and the Silence, the silence btw still watching in 2011 to ensure the destruction of the Doctor, as spotted by Amy in episode 1) and gets shot. However, Riversong, now infatuated with the Doctor after their long years together cannot deal with the thought of killing him, and ends up using the suit's abilities to freeze time itself, keeping the Doctor a second away from death for all of eternity as the universe bleeds into entropy. Well, the Doctor ends up marrying Riversong, and their touch enables the timeline to continue, the execution is proceeded, and it's discovered that he used the Tesseract introduced beforehand to fake his death. Riversong, blamed for the murder of the Doctor, is arested and incarcerated at Stormcage, where the past Doctor often runs off with her on dates.",0,1411345061,null,0,false,0,ckovi8s,t3_2gz4em,t1_ckovi8s,t1_cko3z7w,null,1426886741,11,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11

As the Doctor begins his journey with an adult Amy Pond ([Karen Gillan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Gillan)), joined by her fiancé [Rory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_Williams) ([Arthur Darvill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Darvill)), he is unaware of similar-shaped cracks that appear in various moments in time, such as in the hull of *Starship UK* in ""[The Beast Below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beast_Below)"", on a wall in the [Cabinet War Rooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_War_Rooms) in ""[Victory of the Daleks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_of_the_Daleks)"" and in a kitchen in ""[The Lodger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lodger_(Doctor_Who\))"". The nature of the cracks is revealed in ""[Flesh and Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesh_and_Stone)"", when the Doctor discovers that the crack is a result of a time explosion on 26 June 2010, the day of Amy's wedding to Rory and the danger it posed. The Doctor also learns that the cracks are also the result of the TARDIS exploding.

He's 9 now &amp; has never really been into watching tv (or movies) since you know, BIRTH. I remembered watching Doctor Who when I was young with my dad on PBS, but those teenage years hit, my dad passed away &amp; I strayed away from even thinking about the show. When the reboot happened I was on maternity leave &amp; I started to watch the show again, loving it as much as I remembered &amp; then some. 

I had hoped my son would get into the show but toddlers? No attention span...and when my son hit kindergarten he had trouble in school, quirks, attention span, behavior &amp; we received the diagnosis, ADHD &amp; less than a year later Aspergers. Medication helps him at school but he's never really up for television after a long day. I could never pin him down long enough to get him to watch. 

Until we bought a new house &amp; had to move...since our sons entire life was in boxes, he was more open to other things I guess:) one evening I was opening a few boxes &amp; I had the tv on bbcamerica where they were playing The End of Time Pt1. The show started with my son in the room, and since he is always noisy in some way I thought he had left to explore the house the room was so quiet until my husband walked in &amp; asked what I was watching. When I told him DW he said ""I was wondering what show it was, because Bear hasn't moved an inch in the last hour"". I turned around there he was, quietly watching. Part 2 started &amp; he stayed quiet &amp; watched. After the end he asked me what it was, I told him Doctor Who &amp; he immediately said he wanted to watch more.

~Cue me RUNNING to get my DVDs out of a box~ 

He's been a faithful Whovian ever since. I took him to a Con for the 1st time last summer, he got to meet Gareth David-Lloyd &amp; Sylvester McCoy. For a child who is completely opposed to anything new, people or experiences, a child who is highly functional but has internal ""issues"" with a lot of everyday occurrences, I was thrilled with how outgoing he was &amp; how much fun he had at his 1st Con. 

He kept going on about ""how the Con was so much different than he imagined &amp; filled with people just like him, people that loved Doctor Who""...it was a pretty big moment for him and me. All because of a television show...a GREAT television show.

If Poch's playing style is such a departure from what we've done previously, then it only stands to reason that it will take quite a while before it is fully evident.  We have to expect that he is still learning the abilities and limitations of the squad too in game situations... what they do at training is kind of irrelevant compared to what they put in on the pitch.

Add to the fact that we had a Europa away game on Thursday, and it means that players aren't necessarily going to be as sharp or proactive about strictly adhering to tactical instructions.  It's not a valid excuse, but it does go some way to explaining how we played.

We have some very talented individuals in our squad, but it's been a long time since we've really played as a team on a consistent basis.  Sherwood at least recognised that and just released the team from any tactical complications and got them playing football like we did under 'Arry.  I don't think this is the long term answer, but either we make ourselves slaves to this new system (our third in less than a year, don't forget) and accept that until Xmas we are going to drop quite a few points, or we try to come to some kind of bastardised balance, where we play the looser, pragmatic football of Sherwood/Redknapp whilst only trying to make incremental gains in tactical understanding.

&gt;The __bootstrap paradox__, or __ontological paradox__, is a [paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_paradox) of [time travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel) that refers to scenarios whereby items or information are passed from the future to the past, which in turn become the same items or information that are subsequently passed from the future to the past - this creates a circularity of cause-effect such that the items or information have no discernible origin. Thus, the paradox raises the ontological questions of where, when and by whom the items were created or the information derived.

Your reference points, the side you show your attacker to, the foot you have to use to make defensive plays and playing out to the flank, for instance, are all different. Players like Cannavaro, Nesta, Southgate (not in the same league as them, of course), and lots of other centre backs have confirmed that it is very difficult to play on the other side after playing one side for your whole career. Yes, there are players who can play both but this is because they're *used* to it and have adapted. And why are there many right footed centre backs playing together in the premier league? Because there are more high quality right footed centre backs than left footed centre backs, and so they have to adapt. With time maybe Agger would adapt but I doubt he would be the same player he was, much the same as when Cannavaro suffered his worst dip in form when he was put on his weak side at Madrid, and we certainly wouldn't put them together as a pairing just for a game. This isn't ""FM bullshit"", in fact I'm more inclined to apply that critism to you given that your argument is literally ""there are two centre back positions""..

It's taken me all season, to the very last line in this episode, to come around to this New Doctor. But now I'm sold. Now I'm on board. Now I'm totally excited!

Take THAT everyone who implied that because Capaldi was old, there could be no more romantic tension involved. He's *the Doctor*, who CARES if he's old! I never expected for a moment to stop crushing on the Doctor just because they announced an older actor; he's a cool character, *that's* the draw- not just Matt Smith in a bowtie.

It's not that I'm even particularly fond of romance- this just makes his character that much more complex, vulnerable, and empathetic. I'm far more invested in his journey and personal growth now that we know he has a real piece of himself invested in his relationship with Clara. And not in a sad puppy kind of way, either- the Doctor may look like an old man, but he's still a contender! Between him and mush-mouthed, milquetoast Pink, I know who would win in my book! ^.^ 

I always thought it was a little shallow, and a little ageist, to presume that an older actor meant the end of a romance angle on the show.

1)  Can someone explain the Doctor's plan specifically?  How did he get these suitcases into those specific points in the bank before he and the others got onto the scene and hacked through?  And if he could, then why were Psi and Sabra needed?  

2)  Ultimately, psychologically speaking, why did the director end up feeling remorse?  Im not doubting that the wisdom of life can change a hardened soul.  Unfortunately, we never got a peak as to that potential.

Me personally, I imagine her as a girl experiencing poverty who did things she never desired to make it to the top.  And though she feels guilty, she can't help but let go of the power she has.  The clones provide not only a surefire way to control facility, but it also distances herself from the things that she does (killing of customers, the enslavement of the tellers), which is why she hates them so much.  

3)  Not a question more of an issue, I'm not a fan of time loops that happen by someone remembering a time loop that has happened and doing actions to fulfilling it.  I prefer something where a situation that calls for no other way for a plan to commence happens which leads to a time loop.  It's the same way i wasn't a particular fan of how ""Big Bang"" went down.  If you could alter it in any way without trashing the back heist, how would you do it?  I almost like the idea of a rescue mission for themselves.

England should have the same powers as Scotland. And Scottish MPs shouldn't be able to vote on devolved matters. That's not even remotely fair. 

As for fucking over the Labour Party - so what? If the people of England like to vote conservative, they should GET conservative. That's democracy. I thought the whole idea of this 'local democracy' idea was to get the party your region wanted. Labour should accept the idea and change their policies so people in England will vote for them. How retarded is it to stick to your ideas and have to manipulate the system to make sure you have power? They SHOULD be responding to the will of the people. 

Scotland bitches about occasionally getting Tories when they always vote Labour. So why shouldn't England bitch about Scotland contributing 40+ seats to Labour when England voted Conservative?

Either you devolve powers equally, or we scrap the whole thing and work as one single nation. Scotland can't have it both ways where they get 'protected' from Conservative governments but still get to fuck things up for England.

false,Everton_11,crest,Bill's Brown Bomber,"I think most of the issue at the moment isn't fatigue.  I think a good chunk of the first three games were down to Jags lacking confidence, and that was clearly felt across the whole of the backline.  Now that he's back on his game, I think we'll start seeing some improvement.  

To your point about Gibson and Besic, Gibson is coming back from a very nasty cruciate ligament injury, and you don't fuck about with those.  You go very slowly so you don't fuck it up a second time and lose him for another year.  For Besic, he's still very young and impetuous.  Exhibit A: comes on against West Brom and picks up a booking in a matter of two minutes.  Exhibit B: first touch of the ball against Chelsea and he tries a bit of skill, and gifts Costa a goal.  He needs to learn some discipline, and be eased into the side.  I think it's very similar to Deulofeu last season.  He'll get little run outs in the league, and play a much larger role in the cups until Martinez knows he can trust him to play the proper role.

The individual errors have to stop, though.  Two from Timmy, but I think that's an anomaly.  He's the sort of fellow who fucks up once in a while, but gets himself back on track.  Remember when he got sent off against Sunderland in December, missed the Southampton game, and came back?  Apart from going to Anfield, he and the boys conceded ten in twelve games.  He was visibly pissed at himself, and he's going to work very hard at atoning for that.

I would also say that I don't think we're sacrificing defensive cover for the sake of the attack, either, or at least, we don't have to.  We pulled our best Premier League points total last season, but what stopped us from making the Champions League was that we didn't quite have the goals.  That is no longer the case.  We may not have created a ton of chances, but we have been absolutely ruthless in taking the ones we have created.  I think Martinez has realized that we need the goals, and is looking for us to play a more open game in attack.  The issue with a more open attack is that it's hard to get back against a team that's good on the counter, which Palace took full advantage of today.  Martinez is experimenting presently, and trying to find the right balance between attack and defense.

Martinez has one of the best footballing brains in the world, and I don't imagine he's sleeping too well at the moment, because he's trying to figure out how to fix it.  And he will.  He loves this club now, and to anyone who doubts that, please recall that there is not a club in the world that would do [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNPj8Xm1fSA).  

We'll get there, we just need patience.  There's a lot on this club's plate right now, and I know that everyone there is doing their best to fix it.  That's what Everton are.  Hard work, style, and science.  

Also, about the points we're dropping now, and last season, everybody drops stupid points, nobody's perfect.  City loses to Stoke, Liverpool to West Ham, United to Leicester, Chelsea to QPR.  It happens.  It does not mean the manager is shit, or needs to be fired.  It means the players and the manager are human, and that the guys on the other side of the pitch had a better day than we did.  That's life, and you can accept it, admit you messed up, and work to fix it, or wail like a spoiled two year old who didn't get a lollipop.  Your choice.  

And let's be honest, I respected the hell out of David Moyes, but I'm a happier when I see us lose to a team like Palace with Martinez in the dugout than I was when Moyes beat United.  The attitude of the players and the manager are far better, and I know Martinez can and will achieve great things with this squad.

Roberto had a dream,

To build our football team,

We had no money so we signed the players on loan,

We play from the back,

With Ross in attack,

The School of Science,

Is on it's way back.

false,not_a_morning_person,null,null,"It's always said that they represent the ""opinions of the working class"", but in many polls and surveys, the Green Party come out top when policies alone are looked at. Which 'alternative' party ""represents the working class""? Well that's a difficult question as class identity has somewhat diminished over the past few decades and the concept of a homogeneous working class is a shaky one. Nonetheless, if we assume Ukip represents the working class I can only assume the workers want to be out of Europe, to have minimum wage eroded, benefits eroded and the NHS privatised. Some policies would possibly garner support: the raising of the tax threashold for one - however, that comes in tandem with the removal of a progressive taxation system and the implementation of a flat tax, which would mean working class earners would be supporting a proportionately larger share of the tax revenue. A move made possible only with a reduction in government spending, resultant in a reduction in government services, disproportionately impacting on lower earners.

I think the labour vote has dwindled amongst working class comminities precisely because the modern Labour Party is radically different to the past Labour Party. People from across the socioeconomic spectrum are disenfranchised with Westminster politics, and I think that's a bigger motivator than ukip's particular policies and claims.

Ukip's previous manifesto was appalling. Their next will be stronger. But a former investment banker who wants to sell off the public sector does not have ""the working classes"" in mind. The sooner ""working class"" voters realise this, the sooner they won't be quite so sold on Ukip.

Moreover, re: media, Ukip may have received a lot of bad press, but at least they received press. The only other similar alternative party, the greens, hardly received a fraction of that attention. Despite actually being a longer standing party with more elected representatives.

I completely agree with this. People are tired of being talked down to by westminster politicians. However, I do think particular policies (i.e. immigration and EU) are strong motivators for people considering UKIP.

UKIP started off as a protest vote, but have gained legitimacy as their policies have been battered and beaten in the press, but remain unbowed in any serious debate. (There are some examples of a poor perfomance by farage in debate, but they are few and far between).

The greens are incredibly fractious and have a fairly poor track record in Brighton too. Also, they are a liberal party who have very un-orthodox fiscal policies.

What I don't get about arresting someone for racism over twitter is that you can't punish your way from ignorance to knowledge. You can't beat tolerance and morality into a person. That's why it is ""our"" (as in the rest of society) responsibility to exert control over ourselves and not resort to barbarism when faced with simple things like ignorance. 

I think that if someone says something racist on twitter and people find out, they should be ashamed, their boss has the right to fire them for disgracing the company, they should be called out for what they are and treated like the dickheads that they are. But I draw the line at reactionary revenge on a governmental level because in my opinion if you legislate speech then in some ways you are legislating thought, and that goes against a lot of the ideals of a free society. The difference is when your speech puts someone in direct danger which is why the United States doesn't have absolute freedom of speech -- you can't yell ""fire"" in a crowded theater, for example, or incite a crowd to kill someone. These dickheads on twitter did not put Mario in danger of life, limb, property, anything by calling him a racist name. Yes they were morally reprehensible but that's it.

I think people massively overestimate the amount of bureaucracy that would be involved. Also, consider that whole departments could be removed from the central government, and that many departments have to have local branches that operate separately anyways but aren't under direct political supervision, and thus aren't as accountable to the public.

Even with someone playing off the striker, like VDV used to do, so it's more of a 4-4-1-1 could work.  Eriksen and Lamela could both fulfil that role handily, or Soldado could be the little guy Ade knocks long balls down to.

At the moment we're suffering from a lack of width, and so I don't think that 4-3-3 is going to help that problem, especially when we would just be crowding the pitch with players that all want to play centrally.  We could try Lennon on the right side of midfield, and Townsend/Lamela on the left of the front three, which is about as close as we'd get to true wingers, but I'm not sure that's the best use of our players.

4-3-3 might work for Arsenal if our plan is simply to contain them, and bog down their midfield.  4-3-3 in attack become 4-5-1 in defence, with the two wide attackers dropping back to help.  It could work, but I think it would be more reactive than proactive.

Eriksen gets given licence to pull wide and make runs into the channels for through balls.  Soldado or Ade holds the fort up front, with Lamela making late runs into the box from out wide to link up with moves and finish them.

That said, swap eriksen with Chadli in your lineup and I'd be on board. Chadli is a much better winger, he's got better pace and solid dribbling skills. Eriksen is naturally in the middle of the pitch.

And to be fair to Adebayor, the service into him from crosses was pretty sub-par. There was only one instance I remember thinking ""how did he not get a hold of that!"" 

I think what we really need to do is play wider, pump crosses into Ade, and let Eriksen behind it all to supplement the crossing. Lamela has a strong tendency to cut inside, but given how we keep getting possession, the defense is usually solidly positioned in the middle and his cutting inside does nobody any good. Need to keep him wide, keep Chadli wide, and trust Ade to do what he does best - get on the end of crosses - while Eriksen is the primary distributor. Supplement with a long shot or two from someone (Schneiderlin) named Dembele and Bentaleb, and you've got a pretty decent attack.

It's also worth nothing that Walker's absence has played a huge part in our struggles. His pace and crossing ability (such as it is) provides so much width, especially with Lamela always cutting inside.

There is zero pressure from the midfield on the opposition. Gerrard is playing as a DMF from the looks of it. He won no tackles and played no through ball all game against West Ham. 

He may not be directly at fault for any goal, but indirectly he is. Because of the lack of cover / clearance from the midfield, the defense is coming under tremendous pressure, which because of their horrid form they arent able to handle. 

Also, if he's being man marked, it's his duty to break free of that. If you're using that as an excuse, you're already justifying that he's not able to break the shackles, which means he isnt playing well, simply put. Which means he needs to be benched.

You could put Chadli there, but he completely lacks that burst of acceleration to take him past players.  Time and time again you see him beat someone with footwork, then he tries to muscle past them with his arms and shoulders because his feet can't get him around them quick enough.

false,Antsonfire,num18,,"Yeah, fair enough. From what we're seeing of Lamela, it should be obvious that he's not a goal scorer or a winger in the mold of Bale or Ronaldo. He's a creator above anything else, and that's because of his roots as an attacking mid IMO. 

Townsend...I hate to be that guy, but I am utterly disappointed in him. He doesn't seem to have improved. I know *on paper* he has everything needed to succeed-raw pace, two footedness-but it's just not coming together. That's the primary reason that Rod appeals to me so much. Not only would he know what Poch is trying to do, but he has Townsend's pace (I'd say a bit slower, but not by much) and a solid goalscoring record. He'd also make a great contrast to Kane, Soldado and Ade, none of who excel in mobility, and thus get marked out of the game by big lumbering center backs (say, Kompany or Terry). 

But it's like I said. Poch, and I'm guessing here, is a student of Bielsa and thus lives in a post-formation world. The 4-2-3-1 is fine I think, because we have lots of central midfielders giving freedom to our most creative players in Lamela and Eriksen. Maybe something does need to change, but it's not the formation that's the inherent problem. It's that we played a poor man's David Luiz in Chiriches and a Kaboul who's past it.

Let's take the QPR match as a sample (I don't think it's a good one;they're spectacularly bad right now and anyone can walk away with three points if their defense is pushed too hard). 

Check out [this attack](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dFgkjcQXCgI/U_tUAKAss3I/AAAAAAAAAQ4/3Z8RKz_Zdxk/s1600/4.png), and [this one too.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dFgkjcQXCgI/U_tUAKAss3I/AAAAAAAAAQ4/3Z8RKz_Zdxk/s1600/4.png)

There's a problem that goes deeper than just formations. Lamela is not a proper winger and Eriksen was born to assist and occasionally score.

Both Ade and Soldado have scored plenty of goals over the years from crosses coming in behind defences, or through balls.  Since the start of last season, they've hardly had any of either.

Crowding the box isn't working for us, because it actually blocks supply lines to our striker.  If you watched Bobby at the start of last season (the last time he was consistently playing for us), he often would make little darts here and there, but there was no room for our attacking players to feed the ball through to him.  He's never gonna win a heading competition against a big CB, and yet we continually pinged balls towards him from positions that forced him to have his back to goal.

If you watch Man Utd's first goal last night, Falcao (a out-and-out striker) was providing the width to get into space on the left, and then get far forward enough to loop a cross behind the defence, so that RVP could meet it facing towards the goal.  It's simple soccer, and yet we hardly ever do it.  Too often we cross either too early, or from an inverted winger, which sends the ball towards goal and requires our striker to have his back towards it, and the defenders to be facing it.  The best chances nearly always come when you've got defenders running back towards their own goal... they can't judge clearances as well, and can easily knick it into their own net or into the path of one of our players.

&gt; Then, by that logic, the citadel where the First Doctor steals the TARDIS in ""The Name of the Doctor"" isn't on Gallifrey either because the sky isn't red there. The truth is that Galifrey only has an orange sky at night, as Susan explains in ""The Sensorites"". We can see in ""The Name of the Doctor"" that the sky isn't always orange.

The scene is set indoors. If your suggestion is that the sky should appear--even indoors--then I don't know what to tell you.

As for the orange sky at night, I'm going to blame that on a writer. Because **every** single image we're shown in NewWho has Gallifrey red. Do we have a ton of those images? We do not. But they're there, put that way by multiple directors, multiple showrunners. 

It's shown in Time of the Doctor, Sound of Drums, Family of Blood and others and is universally red. In fact, in Gridlock, the Doctor describes the color of Gallifrey - and paired with what's been established in NewWho, I'll take that over a line in the Sensorites, which is only the seventh episode ever made - long before they had really established much in the way of canon.

**The Doctor**: ""It's beautiful, yeah... The sky's burnt orange, with the citadel enclosed in a mighty glass dome, shining under the twin suns. Beyond that, the mountains go on forever. Slopes of deep red grass, capped with snow.""

There's nothing wrong with your assertion, but you're overlooking all RTD and Moffat's shots of Gallifrey, as well as the Doctor describing its sky as ""burnt orange.""

Dipping into your overdraft probably won't make a huge difference, as long as it's not excessive and as long as it's actually getting cleared.  That said, being young, having relatively low income and having a limited credit record may make a credit card company consider you higher risk.

0% offers are generally for the purpose of transferring a balance.  Often this is limited to transferring a credit card balance.  The reason this limitation exists is to stop you taking out what amounts to a 0% interest loan and investing the credit.  *(This is often referred to as Stoozing.)*

You should be aware that you'll also generally pay a transfer fee of around 3%.  This is added to your balance when the transfer goes through.  *(You transfer £1,200.  They add £36.  Your balance is -£1,236.)*

Pre-2008 the credit card companies would have given you a card on the back of little more than managing to put a thumb print on the right side of the application form.  There are fewer and fewer deals available now though.  Nat West notably are **[advertising that they don't offer 0% rates](http://personal.natwest.com/personal/credit-cards/compare-credit-cards.html)**.

One possible work around for this might be to apply for a 0% card and if you get it, to then also apply for another card.  One without a flashy transfer rate, particularly one with a lousy interest rate, will be more readily given.  You can then pay for your insurance on the second card and transfer the balance to the 0% card.

&gt;What does it mean by meeting minimum monthly repayments, could any give me an example?

Most credit cards require you to make a minimum repayment of something in the order of the lesser 2% of the outstanding balance or £5.  This isn't really an issue in principle, since you're aiming to pay 10% each month.

That said **and this is really important** credit card companies rely on people being bad at financial management.  They rely on the fact that many people won't clear their balances and end up with debt on a card with a rate in the order of 20% APR.  This stuff **only** works if you are disciplined.  If you have the least reason to suspect you might screw it up, you're better going to the bank and taking out a small loan.  You might get a rate in the order of 7% APR and all you have to do is make your repayments.  Given that the saving might only be about £35 after the transfer fee, you're looking at about the cost of a Big Mac each month.

Hazard is far more two-footed than Lamela, which makes him less predictable, but what Hazard does well is that he can take it to the left byline and dribble behind his man, or he can cut in field and either create a shooting opportunity, or link up with another attacker at the top of the box.

Townsend is disappointing because he flatters to deceive, but I still don't think we've discovered the right usage for him yet.  He is a tearaway who needs good players playing in a functional system around him.  He's rarely had that.  He does too often try to do everything himself (with poor results), but at the start of last season when he was regularly playing for us, you could hardly blame him.  We were a terrifyingly static and uncreative side, and he was the only breath of life in us.

-old people dying in winter from high gas prices...we had to pay to fix it again.

- train crashes - we have to pay again for railtrack

- high ticket prices - we have to pay again both for high tickets and to subsidise company profits

- chronic underinvestment in water piping - we pay again in higher prices. 

- repeatedly susidising G4S to deliver a simueltaneously less effective and more costly service. And sometimes even bailing them out of lawsuits and with our own assets (olympics)

Basically purely from a free market perspective a lot of these situations we ended up on the hook twice for private company indolence. At least if a public sector monopoly makes a complete balls up we can vote them out. Under the ""free market"" we seem to end up on the hook both for tbe investments that they were supposed to make and for the high prices afterwards.

I need to watch this episode again(third time) to try and figure out if theory works out ..  PartA - teleport - Part A + B - teleport - Part A + B + C - teleport etc (try to see where in the show they hint/explain this)

Try to figure out when and who teleported to the doctor.

Try to figure out, how they/the doctor knew when setting up each briefcase to teleport back ..

Wait, hold on.. we know the doc placed briefcases ..the doc couldn't teleport after setting up a briefcase.. cos then, he'll teleport to his future self.. and we can't have that now , can we ?

Also... if events play out exactly each time...

Ditto ..teleported first.. went to future doctor ..
Psi-co-mantis .. teleported second.. went to future doctor

Cos when each go to the Doctor to reboot the system(to start from the beginning) - Clara had to obviously be with the Future Doctor then , right ?

I'm so sorry for nitpicking your brain - it's just that each answer I find/come up with it - there's some loophole.

false,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; I was rather disappointed about how quickly the mood south of the border turned against Scotland as if this was a personal affront to them. That it was the English people Scotland was rejecting (or at least threatening to).

Even before the referendum - even before the run up to it over the last two years - the media presentation of the relationship between England and Scotland has had an ugly undertone.  The two big things are fairly well known:  The West Lothian question around Scottish MPs voting on issues that don't effect Scotland *(Tuition fees.)* and the Barnett Formula.

I've said this many times:  Barnett **has** to go.  It's become nothing more than part of a system that leaves everyone thinking they're subsidising everyone else.  The truth is that *(if you accept government spending figures)* everyone earning less than about £30,000 is not a net taxpayer.  A few people get bitchy about this, but not as commonly as you see, ""We're all subsidising YOU!"" either directed from North to South or South to North.

It's not as simple as that, but most people don't get past, ""They get more than you do!!!""  And that right there is why we have an issue.  It's the same spite and obnoxiousness you see aimed at nearly anyone receiving benefits.

Add onto that the fact that Scotland and only Scotland got a say in the continuation of the Union *(and if it had been a national referendum I suspect a great many votes would have been cast because, ""Oh, just fuck off!"")* there was nowhere it was going to go that wasn't going to be ugly.

&gt; This subreddit isn't representative of the wider world since it's mainly young people that use media like this, so I was really shocked at the resentment appearing here towards Scotland. I had hoped this behaviour would have died out by now.    
&gt; For a country so keen on holding the Union together, there didn't seem to be much respect for the people living in that Union. Either they were rabid kilt wearing English hating nationalists or rose tinted deluded idiots.

You have to remember to a degree that moderate voices tend to be quiet.  This means that the obvious ones tend to be the extremists.

&gt; I really think English people don't really know was being English means and I think in large part that is because there isn't An English national identity, there are several. Instead of being proud of what we are now, there's always references to how great we were in the past. Wars fought centuries ago by strangers.

Over and above the fact that England is big enough to not have a single national identity, there's an issue in that we've kind of spent the last few decades telling ourselves that nearly everything English is bad.  You don't build an empire upon which the sun never sets without some serious dickishness.  

I think the difference is more that where it seems that the Scottish identity focusses on the positives, an awful lot of the English identity *(and this is heavily reinforced by our international image)*is personified by either, *"". . . and then the English came and fucked us over""* and the last, desperate attempts of a former world power to cling to relevance.

&gt; I think England really need to have a hard think about what (y)our identity is NOW. Maybe if you find a strong identity that belongs to you (and not your ancestors), you might not be so quick to try to discredit/diminish other parts of these islands who have already found theirs.

&gt; There really was an interesting and mature debate up here in recent years (not just the month it was in the headlines in the tabloids), it was that that inspired so many to turn out on the 18th and have their say. Unless the rest of the UK ""gets that"", you'll never break out of the cycle of non-representative politics that you have now.

The non-representative politics we have is a direct consequence of the homogenisation of the main politics parties *(which I would argue is in turn is linked to the destruction of the power of the unions (and Labour no longer representing the interests of workers as a consequence))* and our diseased first-past-the-post system.  This leads to despair and disengagement because none of the options are any good.

It's a shame that the voting reform we were offered failed, because although it wasn't good enough it might have been a good first step.  *(Much as Scottish devolution has gradually grown.)*

You'd just be voting for a foreign country's foreign policy every general election, and then you'd get hacked off with being under represented and outvoted with that too. Might aswell just go for independence.

One possible solution is implementing Devomax for all four countries, making some kind of military pact between us. We could share the same pot of money for our defence budget. Maybe write a constitution on when military action is and isn't acceptable and/or maybe needing consent from *all* four countries before using our military to engage in military action.

Perhaps R. Ireland would join with the incentive of seeding Northern Ireland back to them. So, Ireland would be reunited, Northern Ireland would still be in a union/alliance with Great Britain, the UK would no longer exist as such which would suck a lot of wind out of both their sails, the Republic of Ireland would be dragged out of its neutral shell and be of some use to the west and our collective military power would be increased.

To expand this alliance further; Ireland could leave the Eurozone adopt the pound sterling. We could all share funding for various projects and institutions (e.g cultural, social, economic, scientific etc). This could be what defines the British isles in the 21st century. Sharing and coordinating what's mutually beneficial where necessary, but otherwise minding our own business, controlling our own affairs where we can.

In fact not just the British isles but the over-seas territories and crown dependencies aswell. Although they're too small to have much influence (if any) in defence and foreign affairs, they could all be under the same umbrella and reap the same benefits of the British &amp; Irish Alliance.

I think you'll find that most MPs are normal human beings. They work way more than 9-5, traveling back and forth between London and their constituency where they have regular meetings with the public.  They could make much more money and lead an easier life in many other career trajectories which can pay a lot more than 65k in London. 

Some abused the expenses, but it was less than 10% of MPs. And frankly that system was awful and totally open to abuse. I wager you'd find similar levels of abuse in any private company with similar rules. And a number of them were kicked out, fined or went to jail. 

Treating them like schoolchildren won't help get better people. Nor would it attract 'normal' people either. How does paying less and slashing expenses attract working class types? It probably excludes them by making it unaffordable to live and work in London while maintaining a normal family life. 

It would be better to treat them like reasonable, decent and professional people. And clearly write the rules and set guidelines for expenses. And when they break the rules you punish them. All this stuff about making them sleep in dorms and banning their holiday is just petty vengeance which would do more harm than good.

However, they've had the opportunity to watch what happens to the minor party in a coalition.  The Liberal Democrats are going to reap the consequences of it in the form of a huge reduction to the number of MPs in Westminster.

So, with even a fraction of sense they should be able to see:    
-Any extreme *right* policy:  Blame UKIP.    
-Any increase in austerity cuts:  Blame UKIP.    
-Further issues with the EU:  Blame UKIP.    
-Hardening of border policies:  Blame UKIP.

More or less the same thing the Lib Dems are getting.  *(Not entirely unfairly, in my opinion.)*

If they're even moderately savvy they might therefore choose not to enter into a formal coalition.  They could agree up front to support specific policy areas and state that they'll act independently on others.  *(This is something I argued the Liberal Democrats should have done four years ago and I think the kicking they're going to take at the polls next year will prove that to be valid.)*

I simply don't see Farage letting the Nigel Farage Show go off the rails by allying himself with the Conservatives.

The conviction related to an incident that occurred on 2 March 2006 in the centre of Bolton, when Khan's car hit and broke the leg of Geoffrey Hatton, a pedestrian who was using a pelican crossing while Khan was travelling at 47 mph in a 30 mph zone and overtaking in the wrong lane.[53] He was cleared of dangerous driving but charged with the lesser offence of careless driving[54] and the pedestrian received an interim payment of £40,000.[55] Geoffrey Hatton never fully recovered from the incident and died two years afterwards from a gastrointestinal bleed with Khan passing on his sympathies.[56] Khan was also summoned to appear in court in Rochdale on 26 October 2007, accused of travelling in excess of 140 mph on the M62 motorway on 31 December 2006. He failed to appear and the case was adjourned to 2 November 2007, with the District Judge warning that he would issue an arrest warrant if the accused did not appear by then. He was also charged with not producing his driving licence and insurance certificate.[57] On 7 January 2008 Khan was fined £1000 and banned for 42 days for the speeding offence.[58]

My overdraft limit is at £1500 at the moment, however I was worried nearly maxing it out could leave me a bit short on available cash, with rent + other bills.

 Also buying a car might leave me without £1200 to pay off the insurance in full, hence why I wanted to use the CC to pay off in full, then repay it monthly.

So if I spend £1200 on the CC, I could pay back £120 for 10 months and everythings fine?

This is a terrible idea for several reasons:

* It threatens the constitution. EVEL would lead to two competing executives both being based in Westminster formed from the same constituent body of representatives. The fights *will never end* about who has what responsibility to consider and execute the supposed will of the English people.
* It centralises English power even further. MPs from London and the South East would have an even greater share of votes when voting on English law, regardless of their political affiliation, than at present, if Scottish and potentially Welsh and Northern Irish MPs are written out of English matters. It might solve the West Lothian question but it doesn’t deliver power to the English regions.

""Proposals for setting up the Highways Agency as a new government-owned company responsible for operating, managing and improving the strategic road network.

The main aims of the changes are to:

give the road operator the freedom to manage the day-to-day operation of the roads without unnecessary interference from central government, while remaining fully accountable for the state of the network
provide greater certainty and flexibility of funding, and stability over delivery requirements, to allow the operator and the supply chain to plan ahead and deliver more efficiently
improve accountability and transparency for road users and the wider public about what the road operator is delivering and how it is performing
Areas covered include proposals around:

structure of the new company
governance and accountability
external scrutiny and challenge
transfer of powers and duties""

As someone fundamentally opposed to privatisation of public services... I'm actually fine with this - It's been proved time and again that public services acting like private companies, which are owned by the Goverment (or local authority) often (though I'm sure not guaranteed) are able to focus on their job without meddling, and to be able to make their own decisions (and be judged on them) huge efficiencies and improvements can be made.

A couple of examples; The Government Digital Service (who created gov.uk) are a self-contained group of skilled people that act like a startup, East Coast (who operate the East Coast Mainline) are said to be doing a brilliant job vs private rail operators, and on a bit of a tangent, at a local level Bay Leisure in Swansea are a non-profit company working at arms reach from the council to deliver the city's Leisure Centre and Watersports Centre, both have been rated the best facilities in Wales.

I honestly think this is the way to go - self-governed non-profit companies set up with the sole purpose to deliver these sorts of services, with their ""profit"" determined on how well they deliver.

You refuse to acknowledge that as Fermanagh &amp; Tyrone were evens at the time, whichever way they went would have been against half the population. To use this to assert an argument of 'supremacy' is simply nationalist fantasy.

Instead you curiously chose to 'quote' a wall of text that is actually you linking two different authors, using one to dispel the other.

&gt;The establishment of Northern Ireland did not occur through the will of the people but through the actions of the state.

That is utterly meaningless. The people voted in the government in democratic and free elections. The border was then drawn by those reps. That is how democracies function.

&gt;The entire island, country, of Ireland voted for independence and in the end they were denied the right of self-determination. 

Ireland as a political entity did not exist. Island is a geographic term, meaningless to this argument. Borders change with time, and as the evidence you yourself posted, there is a clear difference in the politics of north and south. The decision on where to place the border was based on democratic election. It would have been more accurate had Collins respected the Boundary Commission findings. Nationalists don't want to listen to that fact it seems.

&gt;This is history not my bias, 

Er, no. This is you using somewhat grandiose prose and some facts to arrive at your own hopelessly clouded assertions.

And are you claiming the troubles were caused by the simple fact of NI's existence? That is laughable.

I like the idea of devolving right down to the counties - including taxation powers. This includes county-equivalents in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; the assemblies at Holyrood, Stormont and Cardiff Docks will be dissolved, along with their distinct legal systems and sports teams.

Then we replace the House of Lords with a Senate in which each county (or other institution with equivalent power) has equal representation - I'm thinking three per county, appointed by the newly-empowered county councils. Keep the Lords themselves knocking around, it doesn't cost much to issue letters patent and it gives tourists something to say 'Oh, how *quaint*!' about. Just don't let them anywhere near actual governance.

The Commons would have fewer MPs - most of their job is now done locally - each representing a single-member constituency and elected by Single Transferrable Vote. Constituencies would be apportioned between counties based on population, and the constituency borders defined by the county councils - subject, of course, to a requirement for equal population.

Tie the pay of Members of Parliament to the national median wage, quite healthy but not extravagant. Expenses are of course necessary, even quite generous, but whatever policy is enacted should be strictly enforced. Constituency offices should be Government owned and staff employed by the Civil Service, not by the MP or local party.

Back this up with hard-line reform of voting. Introduce the secret ballot. Allow postal and proxy votes only in exceptional circumstances. Require proof of address to register to vote. Require photographic identification to vote Introduce a new national ID card - nothing fancy, not mandatory, no databases, just £10 for a card with your name, photo and date of birth. Possibly place of residence too. Probably quite handy as proof of age for non-drivers as well as safeguarding elections.

Introduce a nationall-yelected (not sure how, there are several possibilities) Prime Minister, whilst retaining the monarchy as a non-political head of state. Trim the Cabinet - I want to be able to have a meeting around the kitchen table. Accept that ministers need not be Members of Parliament. At the same time, maintain Prime Minister's (and other Ministers) Questions. Parliament is not to be paramount, the (executive) Prime Minister and (judicial) Supreme Court will form a triumvirate Crown.

Right of recall and citizen's referenda go without saying, of course. Strict rules to ensure that only private individuals (Trade Unions falling under the same prohibition as corporations) can donate to political parties and causes, with a cap on the total amount an indivdual can donate in a given year.

Policies on taxation, industry, energy, education. transport, defence, immigration and so forth are basically irrelevant at this level, but I've got ideas here that are at least as well thought through as the UKIP manifesto. Faint praise, I know. Anyway, much of this would be within the area of responsibility of the county councils.

Beyond twitter/facebook, there is no serious scenario that warrants either a recount or an immediate revote.

Where that leaves the union is that 45% of Scotland no longer wish to be part of it.

The challenge for the UK is that many of those who voted yes would continue to vote yes in the future, while many of those who voted no are doing so conditionally because they want to see what happens next (many British nationalists would vote no regardless, of course, but there's arguably a large chunk of No that thinks now is the wrong time for independence).

In many ways a Y45/N55 is a reasonable outcome for Yes. IMO, as someone who doesn't put much faith in Westminster's ability to really rethink the UK's constitutional arrangements (beyond ""how can we manoeuvre this to be better for our party""), it's a better result than something like Y51/N49.

15 years took us from devolution to the edge of independence. Let's see how 15 years of being Better Together goes.

&gt; If Westminster could give those who want more powers something to pacify them, it may help, but that may just lead to more referendums when some Scots feel they can control the finances of a country comfortably

That includes more control over taxation, but in a way that's clearly designed to limit your ability to control your own finances. Only income tax will be affected, it must track to within 10% of the UK rate, and any changes must be applied to all three rates simultaneously (you can't raise higher without also raising basic).

That's slightly better than the current system (Scotland must track to within 3% of the UK rate, can only vary the basic rate, and had to pay the HMRC extra to administer it), but it's a long way from saying you can ""control the finances of a country"".",0,1411374451,null,0,false,0,ckp5ydv,t3_2h133y,t1_ckp5ydv,t1_ckockux,null,1426881624,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Firstly Gerrard played three positions last season: double pivot midfielder next to Lucas, allround CM next to Henderson, and then from the start of 2014 the deep role he played until the end of the season. So last season's stats will be a mix of those different roles. A better direct comparison would be Gerrard second half of last season to Lucas' six games in the same position when Gerrard was injured in december 2013.

Secondly his attacking stats are almost totally dependent on whether we score from set pieces. So last season he has a huge scoring contribution (defined as assists plus non-penalty goals) because he assisted a lot of goals from corners and free kicks, and scored a couple of free kicks himself. This season we've yet to score from a set piece, so he still has high key passes from taking all the free kicks and corners, but no scoring contribution. This may reflect a downturn in his set piece quality, or just natural variance.

Thirdly, Gerrard's role defensively is to hold good positions in front of the centre halves to make it hard for teams to find space in that area; to be well positioned to mop up second balls when the centre halves have won a challenge; and to compete in the air for long balls played over the midfield but in front of the centre halves.

The average English constituency at Westminster is substantially [larger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_Kingdom_Parliament_constituencies), and thus requires more votes to achieve a majority or plurality than in the other nations, meaning that at present English votes are worth *less* than votes cast in other parts of the UK and a higher proportion are wasted under FPTP in the many English safe seats. 

This is compounded by the other nations having a second level of representation that we don’t have, and having English MPs in Westminster claim a role as an English Parliament won’t solve that fundamental disparity. The English voter will continue to be very poorly represented under EVEL as opposed to separate English parliamentary or regional bodies.

I’ve got other things than bicker to do today, so I’ll end with the thought that a legislature cannot sustainably act as two executives, particularly when each of those executives is comprised of a different party.

&gt;Adams sent the script for the *HHGG* pilot radio programme to the *Doctor Who* production office in 1978, and was commissioned to write *[The Pirate Planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Planet)* (see below). He had also previously attempted to submit a potential movie script, called ""Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen,"" which later became his novel *Life, the Universe and Everything* (which in turn became the third *Hitchhiker's Guide* radio series). Adams then went on to serve as script editor on the show for its seventeenth season in 1979. Altogether, he wrote three [*Doctor Who* serials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials) starring [Tom Baker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Baker) as the Doctor:

http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2014/sep/22/labour-conference-ed-balls-speech-and-reaction-politics-live-blog

&gt;Q: You’ll have a deficit of £75bn. You will have to do a lot more. What?

&gt;Ball says the most significant thing is to get the economy growing. And Labour would cut waste in spending. It would scrap police and crime commissioners.

What a useless answer. The IFS says Labour plans would end up borrowing £28bn MORE than the Conservative plans. And Balls just says ""we will grow the economy"". Isn't that exactly what the current government have been doing?

Scrapping PCCs... how much money is that going to save? Not exactly a budget-balancing amount.

It's simple - we need to stop spending fucking money like crazy teenagers in Harrods with their rich fathers credit card. Someone, somewhere needs to pay for all this spending. We can't count on perpetual growth to pay for everything forever. The economy is pretty good right now - and I worry that Labour will try to wring out every last drop from it, pushing it into boom and then it'll crash again. 

Clearly Labour are reluctant to raise any taxes, and all they can offer are a few shitty token gestures like **maybe** reinstating the 50% rate, cutting minister pay by 5% and freezing child benefit. All of these are TINY changes which do absolutely nothing to sort out the budget issues we have.

Spurs have a chronic problem. Choking against weak teams. It's been that way since I've started watching. My God we lost to West Ham 3 times last year. How in the hell is that acceptable? 

I've been playing soccer since I was 4. I was a referee for six. And I've coached numerous years as well. I was never in a professional league but I know crap when I see it. 

I've listened to the Spurs Show and many other Tottenham podcasts. Being pessimistic is in the blood. Why? Because we know we're going to spend just enough money to challenge and our team always ends up just short. Yes I know about glory days and the Double. I regularly do Spurs trivia for fun on Quiz Up so I can learn new facts.

After we won the Carling Cup over Chelsea, I bought both the home and away kits. I broke into tears running around the living room when we beat Man City to get into Champions League like I boldly predicted on other Spurs forums. My kids sing the Spurs chants and scream YIDO when we score. I'm all in. Heck I see more people around here wearing Spurs gear than I thought I would and I'm in Texas!

Being American has nothing to do with it. This is about the poor and underwhelming performances Tottenham put on year after year. No matter who the coach, they always lose control of games and allow sloppy goals. The last few years we've struggled to score. 

Pointing out these things don't make us any less of a fan. Tottenham lost to WBA while Arsenal pumped goals in against an overhyped undefeated Aston Villa. If ""a fan"" is not worried, then perhaps they might not be a fan after all. 

I spoke to another person at work today who was a Liverpool lifer. He  was all doom and gloom. We talked through formations and I explained why there was no need for him to panic yet.

Well there’s no reason not to be grateful to offload some of the pressure on that and on to cycling instead. 

The only thing I hope they get right is a proper integration between that and the existing pedestrian / road infrastructure. I’d happily cycle in, but when walking around on pavements and across traffic lights I’d rather not have to dodge impatient commuting cyclists.

&gt;

&gt;An __unreliable narrator__ is a narrator, whether in literature, film, or theatre, whose credibility has been seriously compromised.  The term was coined in 1961 by [Wayne C. Booth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_C._Booth) in *The Rhetoric of Fiction*.   While unreliable narrators are almost by definition [first-person narrators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_narrative), arguments have been made for the existence of unreliable [second-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-person_narrative) and [third-person narrators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-person_narrative), especially within the context of film and television.

&gt;Sometimes the narrator's unreliability is made immediately evident. For instance, a story may open with the narrator making a plainly false or delusional claim or admitting to being severely mentally ill, or the story itself may have a [frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_story) in which the narrator appears as a character, with clues to the character's unreliability. A more dramatic use of the device delays the revelation until near the story's end. This [twist ending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twist_ending) forces readers to reconsider their [point of view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_view_(literature\)) and experience of the story. In some cases the narrator's unreliability is never fully revealed but only hinted at, leaving readers to wonder how much the narrator should be trusted and how the story should be interpreted.

&gt;An exception is an event that did not or could not have happened, told within the fictionalized historical novels, [speculative fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_fiction), or clearly delineated [dream sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_sequence). Narrators describing them are not considered unreliable.

No doubt a lack of a defensive shield is really costing us at the minute but Gerrard's never really been a good defensive shield. Don't forget he's played 3 games in a week and I don't think he's up to that physically, so he was bound to have less energy vs WH.

If you look at the chart his key passes are in the top 5% of all midfielders, that's a massive asset. What's really, really hurting us is the fact that we can't dominate teams like last season (thus keeping the ball, negating their threat) and the fact that our other midfielders and CB's are having poor starts to the season. This highlight's Gerrard's shortcomings more than ever.  

I'd still drop him, we can't afford to carry anyone at the minute, when we are better at keeping teams on the back foot he can come back into the side.

false,[deleted],null,null,"Since AVB left, we've had Tactics Tim for half a season, and Pochettino for five PL matches and three in the EL.  That's hardly reasonable grounds for comparison.  I do, however, agree with you in thinking that the team may still be a unbalanced and in need of new players in a few positions, though I would claim that the number of positions in need of improvement has been significantly reduced during the summer.  The defensive part of the squad is pretty well covered (unless you think it's reasonable that a team of Spurs' current stature should have two RBs of Kyle Walker's caliber on hand), but they're still lacking something going forward.  I think there are especially one or two roles that need improvement: a more wide-playing winger and, maybe, another striker.

Given his history, it's not exactly a surprise that Adebayor isn't showing the same level of commitment as last season, and not buying another striker to compete for the role of big, athletic target man up top may have been a mistake (I don't think Kane is good enough, and have my doubts that he ever will be).  More importantly, though, they should have brought in another winger, as it's been glaringly obvious that the lack of one in the attacking four makes for a really congested central third, with no width.  Watching the match yesterday, you could repeatedly see Pochettino clearly gesturing to his players to use the wings more and try to stretch the West Brom defense.  In my mind, the fact that they still didn't speaks to a lack of players with that kind of ability and mindset.  The one time we had a half decent shot on goal was when Kaboul went flying down the right wing and whipped in a cross to Soldado.  The lack of those kinds of attempts were one of the reasons AVB failed, as well as one of the reasons why Soldado is labeled a flop, and it is now one of the reasons we're not playing well enough under Pochettino.  One significant difference I see between AVB and Pochettino, however, is that the latter obviously wants the team to vary more between narrow and wide play among the attacking midfielders as well as the fullbacks, while AVB exclusively relied on the fullbacks for width while the three attacking midfielders all drifted in towards the center.  Bringing in at least one AML with the ability to play wide could actually be enough to add the extra dimension the Spurs attack needs, as well as put Soldado in the positions from which he was once famous for scoring in droves.",0,1411377585,null,0,false,0,ckp6h5y,t3_2h1a9h,t1_ckp6h5y,t1_ckp43yr,null,1426881382,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

It wouldn't be so bad if it was just a couple of defenders or a midfielder changed (though it would still mean that a well-drilled player like Henderson has to abandon the gameplan temporarily to account for something going wrong elsewhere), but it's so obvious at the moment because we're playing a set of strikers who weren't even in the squad last year.

You're trying to include oil wealth, which is not Scottish.


Without Oil Scotland contributes less then they receive per head.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16477990

&gt;Scottish Executive figures for 2009-10 show that spending per capita in Scotland was £11,370, versus £10,320 for the UK. In other words, spending in Scotland was £1,030 - or 10% higher - per head of population than the UK average.

&gt;What about revenues? **The same source shows Scottish total non-oil tax revenues coming in at £42.7bn in 2009-10, or £8,221 per head, which compares with total public expenditure attributable to Scotland of £59.2bn, or £11,370 per head.**


The oil is not Scotland's

&gt;Now of course, the UK Treasury doesn't agree that the oil revenues belong to Scotland, and it almost certainly never will. In fact, as any Scottish Nationalist will happily tell you, **it was the Treasury that helped to invent a new extra-territorial category of national output for North Sea oil, in the 1970s.** Treasury statisticians will tell you it made sense to keep the oil sector separate from the broader UK economy. Mr Salmond will tell you it was a Whitehall plot to steal the oil from the Scots.


Scottish **PEOPLE,** contribute less in tax then they receive, thats a fact.


Also you're cheeky as fuck anyway trying to claim the oil as your own, the places where this oil is actually located voted far in favour of staying in the union. The rest of you Scots would have just been trying to steal it from them when they wanted no part in your escapades.

It's not a new concept, its just that the larger parties really do seem to do everything to ensure that their specific message, usually just a few words, is what is picked up by the press. I think the whole [Ed Milliband repetition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlTggc0uBA8) thing was a pretty good indicator of how absurd it can be.

Now it's true that to get a message across you have to make sure it's clear and concise, that you don't wander around the issues on tangents etc.. repetition is useful too as are lots of the other tweaks to speaking that people use when giving a  presentation or speech, but there is a point at which it becomes absurd, especially when the audience you are aiming for isn't the one sat in front of you.

Smaller parties still manage to have people who can give an impassioned speech, it's just much less likely that you'll come across it..",0,1411378720,null,0,false,0,ckp6nrk,t3_2h304v,t1_ckp6nrk,t1_ckp5cks,null,1426881295,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1

The first problem with a startup is burn rate - how quickly you get through your investment before you start making a profit (or sell your business to a bigger fish). You want to get a product up and running and on the market before you run out of cash.

In London you have higher office rent, higher living costs for yourself (personal rent and/or commute) and higher salaries for employees (because they also have high living costs).

If you're in Glasgow or Dundee or Birmingham for example you could pay lower rent and salary, and have a lower burn rate, which gives you a lot more flexibility - more time to find a market or build a better product, less desperation to sell out to a larger company.

Or go full or part remote, in which case set up anywhere in the UK or EU. If you need to meet a big investor or customer face to face in London it's just a short train or plane hop away.

I don't think this is workable for a few reasons:

Firstly, lots of policies take months to implement, so one month is too short a timescale to judge whether a candidate has fulfilled their election promise. it would also take some time for a candidate to ease in to the position and begin to show good results. A month would not give anyone the time to establish themselves.

Secondly, we could have an excellent candidate who makes one small mistake which is immediately apparent in the electorates consciousness at the time of election; we'd lose a perfectly capable candidate due to a reactionary vote.

Thirdly, within a year the electorate would suffer massive election fatigue, having to take to the polls once a month. You mentioned that voting is optional, but this would soon lead to massive drops in turnout and bringing in questions of a candidates mandate.

Are you paying off your overdraft fee's each month and reducing the amount you are overdrawn each month or are you trapped in a never ending cycle.  

If you are feeling more financially responsible now you could look at getting a 3-5 year loan from a reputable lender i.e. high street bank and use that loan to clear the overdraft and pay the loan off monthly this will build your score up without any nasty surprise as you will know exactly how much you need to repay each month and the 3 - 5 years worth of repayment shows responsibility to future lenders however it is a double edged sword as a mortgage lender will want the loan paid off before making you a mortgage offer in principle or they may offer a less favourable offer.

Paying off a credit card in full or jumping to 0% cards can actually have a bad effect in the final decision from lenders as they want to make a profit from you and they do that with the interest, if your are not making them any money they will not be as willing to lend to you if you are not profitable enough.

There are so many things wrong with Liverpool this season that it is almost impossible to know where to start. But here goes:
 
The defence has had a huge amount of money invested in it, but sadly looks as bad as ever. The £20m invested in Lovren seems ludicrous, and Slakho hasn't done anything to justify his fee either. 

As for Count Mignolet, he's gone backwards faster than an Italian Tank Commander. He has zero presence, his confidence in himself is at rock bottom, and he lost the confidence of his team-mates, manager and fans ages ago.
 He is playing like a man who is watching his Liverpool career go down the toilet.
 
The midfield simply isn't working; Henderson isn't really a player who will ever change the course of a game, through force of personality or skill, he plays well when the team plays well. If the team is misfiring, Henderson can't change it. As for Lucas, fuck me backwards. What was Rodgers thinking? He was more than happy tolet Lucas go, nobody wanted him, but that doesn't mean he has to play him.
 
Let's be clear, Lucas isn't the player he was two years ago. And even two years ago, he wasn't anything special, and could only play in ONE clearly defined position in the team. He is utterly incapable of playing anywhere else, and shunting him about to allow Gerrard to play in that position is painful. He lurched arthritically around the pitch like a confused, aging and lame carthorse, before Rodgers put him out of our misery at halftime. Nice one.
 
Sterling was easily our best player, but even he needs support and movement. Borini offers movement, but buzzes about totally ineffectually, while Balotelli plays, as always, his own, personal game. Nominally a target man because of his height, he occasionally lumbers into action when the ball is within a 5 yard radius of him, but otherwise offers almost nothing. Never have I missed Suarez and Sturridge so badly.
 
So what the fuck is Rodgers up to? He needs to resolve the keeping issue. He needs to get Sturridge back, and hope that his gargantuan investment in Lovren, Markovic, Lallana et al starts to pay off, because at the moment we look like a team of shambolic strangers, playing a formation and tactical gameplan that nobody seems familiar with.
 
Mignolet (3). He's just really, really shit.
 
Lovren (4). Probably the worst introduction to a Liverpool defender's career since Kvarme. Makes mistake after mistake and at times seems genuinely surprised to be playing as a defender.
 
Skrtel (4). Happy to see him back in the team ahead of Sakho, but it was a display that he will want to forget.
 
Manquillo (3). Will be quite pleased to be hooked, ebcause he looked as if he was going to be targeted by West Ham's high diagonals.
 
Moreno (5). Doesn't like defending as much as attacking, and backed off too often.
 
Gerrard (4). Downing drove at him again and again, and made him look geriatric at times. No positive influence and had no time to dictate the play.
 
Lucas (3). Someone should just shoot the poor fucker and sell him for glue.
 
Henderson (4). Anodyne. The midfield was in metaphorical flames, but all Henderson did was run around and flap a hankie in the general direction of the conflagration. Busy, yes. Effective? No.
 
Sterling (6). Our best player and only genuine goal threat. Which is a bit of a worry.
 
Balotelli (4). One lovely piece of skill and shot. That's about it. Not a Liverpool player really. He's what he always has been; Mario in a football shirt. Which particular shirt is irreelevant to him, as he always plays the same way.
 
Borini (4). Energy, willingness to work, seemed capable of running all day and night. And wouldn't have scored even if he had. 

Subs:
 
Slakho (4). Usual panic-inducing comedy of errors with his comedy sidekick Lovren
 Lallana (6). Typical neat and tidy display from Lallana. Didn't ever seem like he was going to thrash in a goal, or dazzle the defence with a sublime piece of skill or pass, but given he replaced Lucas, he was like Zinedine Zidane",0,1411380571,null,0,false,0,ckp6yhz,t3_2gywhn,t1_ckp6yhz,t3_2gywhn,null,1426881156,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I'm quite lucky in that my skin has always been pretty clear (I get the occasional spot like we all do!) so I don't really have major skin issues that I'm trying to solve, just want to keep my skin clear and healthy! My skin is oily/combination, possibly dehydrated.

**My AM routine:**

* Rinse with warm water
* **OST C20 serum** – new vitamin C serum, which I'm starting to think is HG. I always made my own but wanted to see if a bought product would be any different, and the glow I get from this is incredible!
* **Thatchers Witch Hazel cucumber toner** nice and refreshing, I love the smell
* **Bioderma Hydrabio Serum** – A hyaluronic acid serm
* **Calendula Cream** – a moisturiser that really helps when I get eczema
* **Bioderma Photoderm MAX Ultra-Fluid SPF50+** – I actually wouldn't recommend this as it is really greasy, but I'll use it up anyway and then go back to my Biore perfect face milk

**PM Routine:**

* OCM with mixture of **Hemp Seed Oil**, **Castor oil** and a few drops of **tea tree oil**
* Double cleanse with **Emma Hardie Cleansing Balm**
* ** OST C20 serum
* I alternate every night with **Paulas Choice 2% BHA** and **Pixi Glow Tonic**
* **Thatchers Witch Hazel cucumber toner** 
* **Bioderma Hydrabio Serum**
* **Calendula Cream** 
* Top off with **Vaseline** before bed

The things that I think really make a difference to my skin is cleansing with **Hemp Seed oil**, the **OST C20 serum** and topping everything off with **vaseline**. I feel like since  using those three products my skin looks so much healthier Much plumper and glowy. 

Although I feel like everything I do in the routine serves a purpose and I don't think I'd drop any of these stages, I may swop around say, one of the chemical exfoliants or the moisturiser, but the core aspect will remain the same.

You, miss, need some serious help with both your victim complex and critical thinking skills.

**You are being discriminatory yourself** by concluding that because white young men benefit from something it is somehow negative and discriminatory despite the fact it stops nobody of any age, race, or gender from using it.

false,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; i think there is a chicken and egg sort of confusion going on with regards to AVB's play style. I think we played narrow under AVB because we had players who, by and large, play narrow. 

You may be right, but if that is the case, AVB should have signed least one wider playing midfielder in the cascade of big transfers last summer.  Instead, he exclusively bought centrally positioned or narrowly oriented ones.  At least Pochettino can claim that he needed to assess and get to know his team this summer.  AVB had already spent a year getting to know the squad, and should have instructed Baldini to get him a winger if he wanted them to play wider.  The fact that they didn't acquire a single winger in that transfer window, with the funds they had availble at the time, strongly suggests that he just wasn't that interested in one.  Other than that, I absolutely agree that the players we have aren't close to the skill level required of a Bayern/Barca style of passing the opposition into the ground.  However, I'm not sure that's what Pochettino intends.  Based on his stint at Southampton, as well as some of our matches earlier this year, it looks like he wants a somewhat more direct attacking style, and I think (hope) what we're seeing now is a team in transition towards that goal.

Finally, I admit that I fear your tl;dr is way too close to the truth for comfort.  Even so, I choose to stay optimistic because, judging by his sideline manners and the post-match interview, it looks like Pochettino himself sees and acknowledges what was wrong yesterday.

2. We see the doc manipulating his voice to what we know as the architect.

3. Then we see the doc(alone) place the briefcase + worms on the table(the others are not at the table)(yet).
4. Then(alone) placing briefcase #2 - the ""bomb"".

Why did the doctor lie about knowing about the, ""shredders"" ?

I couldn't move anywhere else in the UK and earn as much as I do doing what I do (in IT). I'm sure it's the case in Finance and other industries as well. The only other alternative for me would be Cambridge or Manchester, the former would be 80% as expensive and the latter just doesn't have the social scene that I like about London.

&gt;The question is, how much talent is London losing due to its insane cost of living

If people have the skills and education I don't think they'd be put off. There are people living in London on 18k (somehow) so it's not such a great barrier despite the high cost of living. Some people might be put off by the big smoke but lots of people are excited to live in London for a few years before taking jobs elsewhere. It's a very transient city by nature.

&gt;and how much is it worth a startup to locate to London given that a huge number of startups don't need ""talent"" in the sense of some golden unicorn top-percentile coder, but rather a reliable person with a decent education/experience and common sense who can put together a functional CRUD or mobile app - Facebook might need top rank engineers to scale now, but it certainly didn't when it was getting off the ground.

Talent is having someone who can reliably fulfil the tasks put infront of them. Sometimes these are hard or unsolved problems that only someone who has a damn good understanding of their profession can solve well. It's the same as any job, you pay for the brain of one person and the hands of another to get it done.

For reference there are commercial body lotions containing 12% lactic acid for daily use, if you want to use lactic acid for occasional exfoliation (say weekly) start with say 20% and work up over a few weeks.

Be aware that some people are more sensitive than others, and that later showers or wetting of the skin can sometimes 'reactivate' lactic acid that has penetrated the skin so that it stings and become irritated.

So fine, but the argument stands you still would have more cash in the pocket living in Manchester. Some people like a social scene, some people like climbing hills, some people just want to save up for a mortgage. 

My point isn't about an established company with a healthy cash flow, however. It's about a startup with limited cash that needs to lower its burn rate and prioritize expenditure. In that position, do you absolutely *need* to start your business in London? Do you really *need* hypothetical top-level talent, or just a decent coder or two? If you can find the people  you need in, say, Glasgow, at half the burn rate, why not get started there? 

So it's not about whether London is the best place for a startup - that depends on what your startup actually needs and what it can afford.

this happens already.  

&gt; this would soon lead to massive drops in turnout  

you vote via your phone. Its electronic.  

&gt; Firstly, lots of policies take months to implement, so one month is too short a timescale to judge whether a candidate has fulfilled their election promise  

this doesn't massively matter. Essentially you'll have ""won"" districts that will remain ""won"" until the person quits or fucks up massively.  Remember I've banned parties so there are no ""revenge"" votes.  

&gt; Thirdly, within a year the electorate would suffer massive election fatigue, having to take to the polls once a month.  

Well you can quit at any time. Voting continues constantly so you don't need to stand on a platform or run a campaign all the time. If you win in a landslide then you'll see your lead slowly chip away until you realise there is an issue so it should never be a surprise. I guess while I'm at it I ban excessive private investment in electoral campaigns. There is a very low cap and those that receive over 10% of the vote get re-imbursed by the state.  

&gt;  would be a year, but even that may be too short to effectively get laws passed without having to rush them through unscrutinised.  

Government is no more speedy. Remember I've banned parties and there is no cabinet (or rather politicians are not in cabinet).

I'm still into the premise. Like I said I don't like an opaque government institution in times of peace. On principle I don't believe it should exist. We didn't need it in the 19th century, so what makes us think we need it now? The world wars and the cold war are long gone and I don't see why these responsibilities couldn't be handled by the police force instead. The police also perform undercover operations from time to time but don't need this lack of transparency to function.

I entirely appreciate why this works elsewhere - for example in the USA. However, the problem with the UK is that the full apparatus of the state, including the residence of the Queen and the Prime minister as well as most government departments are in London. It's also where the secure government communications facilities are located - to administer everything from COBRA to the strategic nuclear deterrent. Relocating it to satisfy some false-perception the UK is too London centric would just be a huge waste of money. 

I don't agree that several of the tenants of the OPs argument necessarily hold. For example, we often hear that it would be *cheaper* to run government outside London. Yet I'm not sure this is necessarily true. There is an efficiency that is hard to quantify in having everything in the same place, particularly one with such major economic and international focus. The fact London is expensive from an individual perspective to live/travel etc. doesn't mean there isn't a justification for it. Clearly the businesses think it makes sense. I also don't think you could simply sell a place like the Palace of Westminster given its historical importance. 

**HOWEVER**, what I would support is the occasional sitting of the House of Commons in regional parliaments. For example a special session each year could take place in **each** of Holyrood, Cardiff and Stormont. They'd probably have to be slimmed down sessions because the chambers physically aren't the correct layout or size to support a full commons session. My thought is it would probably take the format of a region-specific style PMQs. It might help to alleviate this false notion that the House of Commons sits at Westminster and can only think as far as it can see - to the City of London. If successful they could perhaps add a rotating 4th session each year that sits in a major-city (Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle, Glasgow etc.). In the case of an increasingly separatist Holyrood particularly it would help to visibly demonstrate the fact the House of Commons has primacy.

**Look,** I can understand why people are hurt by the perception that politics in the UK is London centric. But that's because the UK **is and should be** London centric. Don't get me wrong, as someone who lives in one of the more deprived cities of the South coast I can appreciate first hand how having a dominant global-city nearby is harmful to the surrounding areas... but London is such a vast asset to the UK. It isn't just any old capital city... it's a global city the rival of New York, Paris, Hong Kong, Tokyo etc. There aren't many places in the world like London and the benefits of having it (from an international and financial point of view) are incredible. London is the reason why we all have the comfortable lives we do. Part of the reason why London is able to occupy that position is because it's the seat of Government as well as business - and since the days of the East India Company and Empire the two have been inextricably linked. You can't underestimate the ability of someone like David Cameron to get a briefing about business in No 10. at 9am, bring some business leaders over at 10am to discuss issues raised, then jump in a car and travel to a government department to run through options with ministers and civil servants - then jump on a plane at Gatwick or Heathrow at 2pm to travel to Berlin to discuss some new proposals with Angela Merkel.

He said he hoped to get cross-party consensus for the plan – with draft legislation to be drawn up by January and a Bill to go to Parliament **after the next election**.

Yeah, the problem with this is that ""peace"" is pretty subjective. You can say we're at peace now because we're not in an all consuming land war with the Nazis, but the fact is is that there is always someone out there working against us. Surely you can appreciate the essential ludicrousness of determining that because no-one that you're aware of is up to anything, MI5 et al should just open up. 1) Criminals and terrorists *are keeping their activities secret so they don't get arrested*, so how would you know we're at peace until any covert attempt to get at them has succeeded? 2) What's to stop any low life looking themselves up on your public database of documents to see if they're being investigated? Literally nothing that I can see.

&gt; We didn't need it in the 19th century, so what makes us think we need it now?

[Except we've needed it since Elizabethan times and beyond.]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Walsingham) Spying is probably the 2nd oldest profession and has existed for as long as there have been people we think night be up to no good but can't be sure because they're trying to keep it on the down low.

Dismantling the apparatus because you don't think there's a threat right now is 100 percent foolish for all the reasons I described before. Reinstating that apparatus when a threat itself is the very definition of an ambulance at the bottom of a cliff.

&gt; I don't see why these responsibilities couldn't be handled by the police force instead.

They are. When your house is robbed, you don't think it's just POLICE that handle that, do you? No, it goes to the burglary department. Murders are handled by homicide division and terrorism and massive country threatening crimes are handled by counter terrorism police and MI5/MI6/military intelligence/special forces (depending on severity/scale of threat). It's all the same work, just different buildings.

&gt;The __Novikov self-consistency principle__, also known as the __Novikov self-consistency conjecture__, is a [principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle) developed by Russian physicist [Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Dmitriyevich_Novikov) in the mid-1980s to solve the problem of [paradoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox) in [time travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel), which is theoretically permitted in certain solutions of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity) (solutions containing what are known as [closed timelike curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curve)). The principle asserts that if an event exists that would give rise to a paradox, or to any ""change"" to the past whatsoever, then the [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability) of that event is zero. It would thus be impossible to create [time paradoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_paradox).

false,Whiskeygiggles,null,null,"I see by your edit that you're coming in the summertime. With that in mind I say you'd be mad to go anywhere except Belfast. The summer is chockablock with festivals and happenings of all kinds here, and the city is compact enough to be able to get to most of it on foot. You'll have plenty to do here in the summer. Summer is great for kids here too, the Ulster museum usually puts on kid specific exhibitions in the summer (there is no kid specific museum anywhere in Ireland that I'm aware of) the dinosaur one they did last year (I think) was brilliant and extremely popular. There is also the brilliant, can't praise it enough, Young at Art children's festival which brings in the best of kids theatre, performance art, visual art, dance, drama and music, from all over the world. I've seen awesome French cowboy audio/visual theatre there, fantastic Hungarian shadow puppetry, and world class kid friendly music recitals. I'm an adult and the kids festival is one of my favourite things about Belfast. Most of those events are free or very cheap (subsidised by the government). 

There's also the Cathedral Quarter arts festival which has big names as well as perfectly curated, well worth seeing, fringe acts in comedy, music, art, drama, everything. There's the festival of fools, a comedy and street performance festival where the streets are alive with free events, comedians, jugglers, musicians, and weird variety acts that are always a pleasure to stumble across. There's lots more going on too. Of course the weather is not guaranteed, but that goes for the whole country! 

In terms of parks, good luck finding a park in Dundalk or newry that isn't a bit dodgy and crawling with drunks and stoned teenagers. Belfast has great parks. I would recommend staying in the South Belfast area (Ormeau, botanic, lisburn road) where there are 2 great large parks (botanic and Ormeau) with botanic having the lovely victorian palm house and the weird but interesting tropical ""ravine"" (a victorian curiosity housing exotic plants and fish) - all the parks and attractions within are free to enter and very kid friendly/safe. 

Newry and Dundalk both have libraries, but they are (pardon my French) crap. Belfast has several decent libraries, they all have kid's departments. 

In terms of music, Belfast is chockfull of bars, from the traditional Irish bars, to hip young thing trendy spots and everything in between. There is live music on, usually free, in several places every night of the week. The same is true in Dublin of course, but Belfast is compact enough to make it reasonable to take much more in without paying a fortune to get here and there, it's all doable on foot. Also, Dublin costs roughly sevently billion quid for a pint, whereas Belfast is normal prices, the same as newry, cheaper than Dundalk. 

I've a bit of an interest in this as I love this country and I want you to see the best of it. All in all, I think you'd be mad to stay anywhere but Belfast, but avoid newry and Dundalk like the plague! You'll be stuck there and will have to go to Belfast or Dublin any time you want to get out of the house anyway. Good luck and happy to answer any of your questions!

I believe you're leading an inquiry into corruption at Tesco. Tesco have been reporting false stock-holding figures in stores for years.  As Stock Control Manager (at store level) it was my job to maintain stock record accuracy.  Although this was an impossible task as there has been a culture across Tesco retail stores for many years to not 'count stock out'.  By this, I mean that if the stock system had a record of 5 TVs costing £1000 each, and there was actually 0, the Store Manager would not allow the system to be corrected.  By correcting the record, it would give a £5000 loss to the store.  So, by not correcting the loss, the store does not 'lose' the stock and that loss is not reported, ultimately, in the accounts.  This is a high value item, but consider this across the business, across all stores, and the actual 'loss' that is not being reported is huge and possibly more than the £250million that the profit forecast was overstated by.  If you want to delve deep you'll find a lot more. I'm a Tesco shareholder and understand that this may have an impact on my investment but am willing to share any information. ",0,1411390779,null,0,false,0,ckp9a4c,t3_2h3yad,t1_ckp9a4c,t1_ckp8e6i,null,1426880072,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

Lovren has been doing poorly at CB. Liverpool's defensive struggles are not secrets right now. I see a lot of Liverpool fans wanting Lovren to sit in favor of Sahko/Skrtel, which should say something. I think the problem that Liverpool is facing is that Lovren was never fantastic, but rather a good player who further benefited from having a great partnership with Fonte and playing behind a very strong midfield made up of Waynama and Schneiderlin. He doesn't have either of those at Liverpool and it's exposing him.

I was quite apprehensive about this game. Man U - recent problems or not - have a lot of talented, dangerous players and they showed it against QPR last week.

At 3-1 down I was practically hiding behind the sofa.

Was the penalty a lifeline? Yes. Was it soft? Probably. But here's the thing: soft penalties happen occasionally. They're practically part of the sport. Why do some teams seem to get a lot of them, then? Simple: if you're in their penalty area you get the advantage; if they're in your penalty area they get the advantage.

That's why better teams seem to get more of them.

So look at them this way: soft penalties are your reward for putting pressure on the opposition and getting into the attacking positions. (Not that I condone looking for them - referees are quite alert about that kind of thing anyway.) If Man U had been all over us then they'd have gotten a soft penalty, but they weren't. Leicester fought, and they got back in, and deserved the win.

&gt;From their point of view it’s almost in their best interests to make it as quick and easy as possible for Immigrants to cross their borders towards the UK – so long as the UK is where they end up.

I may be mistaken but I thought there was an obligation on EU member states to take in refugees and asylum applicants on entry to Europe?

I definitely see why it's in their interests to shift them along their way to the UK but it's pretty spiteful and selfish to not fulfil their obligations and to just shove them onto Calais and let them scrap to get across the Channel.

&gt;Part of me wonders what the UK offers that makes us such a glittering destination vs. any other? Are we a soft touch? Are we being too good to these people?

I think it's the UK's reputation as being a place welcoming to the dispossessed. Where I live much of the infrastructure that the Sikh community owns and sustains is now being made use of by more recent Nepalis, for instance. I guess because Afghans know that Southall, for example, is (was) full of Indians they know it's a place they can go to live their lives freely and with a sense of community. A place where they can enjoy the freedoms and benefits of the West whilst retaining their cultural customs and values.

So I think it's part soft touch because of the sheer brutality of their home conditions by comparison to the line that UK authorities take but also because of the UK's reputation as a welcoming, safe place. You just can't expect people who are recently coming from war zones to adapt to life in the UK smoothly.

Three concrete examples: governments would be voted for using AMS (rather than FPTP), there would be a written constitution, and there wouldn't be an unelected second chamber.

&gt; It came from a history of Scottish some how feeling worse off because they are part of the UK and it's ancestory; the unfair coverage (For example Murray wins it's in an English pub, loses and it's a scottish pub), the weather being London centric, media being lopsided etc etc.

While those feelings may exist for some people, and some who do feel that way might take it to ridiculous extremes, I think you're undervaluing the extent to which people really did look into and think about the issues about self-governance.

I can't quantify that for you with a list of stereotypes, I can just tell you my experience of interacting with random people over the last two years. Many of whom had absolutely no prior interest in politics, many of whom felt that this was a chance for their vote to make a difference rather than simply swapping between the Conservatives and Labour every decade.

&gt; The irony is this isn't just a Scottish thing. People all over the UK feel let down by London and more importantly Westminster.

That's certainly true, and a great many people who voted Yes did so both to choose something new and to help the UK realise that a London-centric approach does not have to be the only way.

Those people were in the minority this time round, and so we stay. Personally I think they're more likely to be in the majority in 20 years or so, as this isn't a new problem for the UK nor is it one that there's been much inclination by Westminster to address.",0,1411392182,null,0,false,0,ckp9qew,t3_2h133y,t1_ckp9qew,t1_ckp9cjf,null,1426879840,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Our chance creation and attempts on goal have been on par with last season too. West Ham nullified us well, but we still had plenty of chances. We've seen this season that it's the final ball that holds us back. Perhaps an overhit pass or dodgy finish. But the difference is these are not structural, or root issues, they are limited to the players.  It's that final touch which is sending us down - but that is also something we know can and will improve, as the new players are bedded in and as we saw with the same players last season. But also, as the team finds a bit of form.

But the defence is a genuine issue - its not a form issue or a personnel issue. It's a structural issue in the team that without doubt extends to Rodgers and the coaching stuff. Unfortunately there has been no improvement from last season. Poor marking, poor individual decisions, inability to play a flat line and put players offside and a total lack of basic organisation.  

It's not so much the goals that we have conceded as it is the type of goals that we have conceded: all preventable. All the type of goals that lesser centrebacks seem to be fine with dealing with. All types of goals that both Sakho and Lovren have dealt with before, both with France at the WC and at Southampton last season.

false,andrew137,null,null,"Let us remember that the last two ""disappointing"" have returned our records points tally almost twice. Very different scenario to Liverpool. Liverpool were a basket case on a highway to becoming a mid table club. Their squad was terrible - they had spent huge money of Stuart Downing and Andy Carroll and in general, they were in a much worse position when Rodgers took over than we are now. Rodgers used the transfer market (mainly shipping players out) quite effectively and he made some improvements to the first team.

If we look at Spurs, there are a couple of players that come to mind who should've been shipped at much in the same way Carrol and Downing were. Paulinho is the most similar reflection. Big money signing gone wrong - Rodgers made the call to cut our losses, someone (probably Poch) should've made the same big decision with Paulinho.

Secondly, we did not improve our first team in the summer. TBH, I thought Fazio would've been merged into the first team, but we have barely seen anything from him despite a good performance in an average side in Europa. We've seen a few minutes from Stambouli. Apart from them, everyone else looks like cover. Dier is not going to be starting ahead of Walker when he's fit. A lot of people will say that's fine because our team is quality. Yes - it is. But is it the quality that Poch needs? I find it very hard to believe that every one of the 11 players that make up our ""first team"" perfectly suit Poch's system. Therefore, signings should have been made. The first thing that comes to mind is our failure to sign Scheniderlin. We should've broke the bank for this guy. We should've shipped Paulinho out to make room for him. Schneiderlin on his own probably isn't worth 30million (although his value has only increased after this start to the season), but giving a new manager a central point to build a team is worth a lot more than 30million. If we got 12mil for Paulinho - that'd be an 18mil net spend. Seems like a no brainer. Rodgers has always been very quick to bring in players that he wants that he thinks will fit his style of play. Example: Coutinho

We are not Liverpool and this situation is not anymore like Liverpool's situation than it is any other club who has recently acquired a new manager (If anythign, Liverpool is like us last season after selling our best player and going gangbusters on the transfers). Poch needs time and hopefully he will get it. He was never going to turn us into world beaters in 8 matches. It's just frustrating that after a very promising preseason and opening couple of matches, we seem to have gone backwards.

false,lgf92,eng-northumberland,Land of the Sausage Roll,"I'll run through everything that happened. It's important to distinguish between university internal selection procedure and the process by which UC producers select the teams.

St Andrews, unlike some of the universities featured, has a largely hands-off selection process. As I recall, there was an ad put out for anyone wanting to captain the team and they met with one of our Union sabbatical officers who selected them on general knowledge and their representation outwardly of the university. That's how the captain and vice-captain were picked.

Then it moved onto finding the two team members + reserve, and in October about 150 people applied and underwent a 50-question general knowledge quiz set by the captains that they had to do in 15 minutes and which was on almost every topic imaginable.

The captains then took the top 10 from those scores and ""called them back"", which involved an interview with the captains and a further general knowledge quiz, but this time individually and with bonus points for interruptions.

They then selected me and two other guys (we came 6th, 7th and 9th in the top ten from the general knowledge quiz initially as well, so evidently the top 5 weren't quick enough or got caught out) and we applied officially as the St Andrews team. The university's only obligation is to ensure that only one team from the institution applies - as anyone could technically found one, the Union would have been responsible for playing them off against each other and deciding which would represent us.

We then received a package from ITV with all the application forms and a 50-or-so set of sample questions that we were to answer and send back. We did those and were informed that we had got through to the next stage, which involved an interview with the producers in Edinburgh.

We met them in a hotel in Edinburgh and we were sat down (with another team in the same room, Glasgow if I recall) and generally interviewed about our thoughts about uni challenge, our team, what made us good for the show. We then did a 50-question general knowledge test with no conferring, but our scores were cumulative - so if one person got the question right and the other three didn't, it still counted as a point for the team. We were informed that it wasn't just our raw score but our ""suitability"" for the programme that would count in their final decision.

They then asked us if we'd film ourselves receiving the call from the producers as to whether we would be on the show or not, which happened in late January. So we had a tense couple of months' wait. They called us up and told us we were going through and it was an amazing feeling, as we'd worked so hard to get there (St Andrews has traditionally performed really badly).

We were scheduled for filming in Manchester early in March, but in the meantime the BBC were also filming the documentary about the applications process and sent a crew up to St Andrews to film us practicing and talking about ourselves. It was a good laugh.

This is simply not true. Banner turns into Hulk as a result of gamma radiation.

Alien's don't really come into play until the Tesseract.

True and maybe I'm being a bit conspiratorial but it just feels like other EU countries deliberately make conditions for them worse so solidifying the incentive to reach the UK.

&gt;Agreed - there's a teething period - but I think it's a fair price for coming to a relatively safe, welcoming country.

&gt;Certainly we should expect better than 'it's OK to rape people because I'm from a war torn country'!

Definitely but I don't think we've ever seen quite the same nature of consequences of a lack of integration have we? I'm the son of Sikh immigrants and whilst they say there was some discrimination against them when they arrived in the UK in the 1970s, they too are aghast at the lack of respect for British cultural values that newer immigrants from the likes of Afghanistan and Somalia exhibit. Things weren't easy for them but they weren't marginalised and made a go of it and did OK because the system let them. 

But that same system has been skewed now and is being treated with contempt by people who don't have a hold on the concept of fair play and excusing their behaviour because of their origins isn't helping the situation because as you say, it's not acceptable. Other made good without resorting to criminality on the same scale so why can't they?

The worst bit is that even in the aftermath of Rotherham and so on it's still the elephant in the room so I don't see things coming to a head simply because if you air opinions on the topic you're just accused of being an Islamophobe and/or a racist. And if social workers in Rotherham were effectively silenced despite it being their intention to protect children then what hope the Average Joe who just wants to air his concerns?

Most insurance companies also have requirements in their terms and conditions which state you should inform them of any collision regardless of if you are claiming.

You should go to a police station and complete an accident report, this will take about 10-30 minutes depending on how detailed they are. You should do this within 24 hours and as soon as possible by law.

Your insurance will likely increase a small amount as a result of being in a collision regardless of fault - however you may be able to claim this back from his insurer as additional ""damages"" you have suffered - do some ""trial"" quotes and see how much difference adding a crash makes and then add that onto your claim.

If the other driver is located and causes issues by the police he can be prosecuted for Failing to Stop which can carry heavy points and a fine. There is always a risk that the reason he didn't stop is he is not insured and the vehicle not registered to him.

You can check his insurance, if you have his reg, by doing a check at [AskMID](http://www.askmid.com/askmidenquiry.aspx).

I would recommend reporting it, it can cause you more legal issues if you don't and he does. Of course this is your own decision but the law says you should.

They literally had to have a two hour meeting to come up with ""if we take colleagues off department, they will struggle to finish their jobs"" how much did it just cost to pay all these managers for two hours to come up with basic common sense?

I work in tesco and most colleagues have their contracts altered so it says the work on department-X when in reality they are full time check-out staff. I work late shifts on mondays and saturdays and typically I have to balance every department in the store because the 7 or so other members of staff that are contracted to their relevant departments are actually on checkouts. I think it is so that it looks as if the store is serving customers in a good speed and not letting anybody queue while still supposedly having members of staff on their own departments. Whenever this issue is brought up the store manager only says ""you are general assistants, just deal with it."" Every time upper management come in to check how the store is going, every other store in the area tip each other off so they call in every available member of staff they have to put on the image ""look how many people we have running a great store and yet we're not over spending! Can I have a raise?"" 

Also we have rats because tesco decided keeping food waste in the wagon yard in a giant locked skip and paying a company to empty the skip every week was too expensive.

Depends on the tenancy length.

If the initial tenancy is 12 months long then it would make sense for the letting agent to require 12 months up front, they want to ensure that the entire fixed term is paid for. 12 months upfront is unusual *because* most initial fixed term tenancies are 6 months (unless the tenant requests longer for security, or the landlord has specific commitment requirements).

false,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"Politicians are and are percieved to be lying, egotistical arseholes. They are only interested in political reform when it is in their political interests. Due to the nature of politics those who have power under the status quo are the ones who benefit from FPTP and those excluded do not have power.

The general public are aware of this and trust politicians about as far as they can throw Eric Pickles. This cynicism results in a healthy level of distrust, dismay and contempt which helps keep politicians in check.

The *downside* of this is that when a bunch of politically incompetant losers who keep failing miserably at politics start demanding changes to the political system which would be very much in their own self interest and make their jobs significantly easier, give them money and entrenched power, well, the public tend to see it as a self serving measure. This is because it is. This is furthered as the only way of getting a change in the political system requires a deal to be done with a larger, more powerful party. To change the voting system you have to priortise the change over helping the poor, other vested interests and other parts of your manifesto. This merely furthers the perception of self interest and hypocracy.

When the people who do well under the status quo determine the style of voting and are reluctant to change it, are better at politics than the people excluded, and those swing voters in the general public who are ignorant of the harms of FPTP do not trust those advocating a change, how exactly are things going to change?

TL:DR. People who want electoral reform tend to want it because they are crap at politics. People who are crap at politics are unlikely to get what they want.

Text account:  

Johnston became yet another player to find it hard to settle into a first team place at Anfield. Meanwhile, Brucie's erratic goalkeeping was causing concern. This manifested itself to such an extent that in possibly Brucie's worst ever performance for Liverpool we were humiliated 1-3 at home by Manchester City on Boxing Day. With the Reds down to eleventh place and no chance of winning the League (!) drastic action was required. What did Bob do? Replace Grobbelaar? No, Bob knew that he had a gem in Brucie, he just had to be persevered with. Bob took the unusual step of changing captains in mid-season. Okay, Thommo was upset when the leadership was taken away from him but Bob's decision to make Souness his first in command on the pitch proved to be totally justified.   

With Souness at the helm on the pitch and youngsters Rush and Whelan putting in stirring performances seemingly every game things soon started to turn. Brucie started to look the great goalkeeper that Bob always knew he was. 

The League Cup Final at Wembley against Spurs seemed to be going the way of the Londoners who led for most of the game after an early goal from Archibald. That was until three minutes from the end when Sammy Lee played a forty yard ball to Whelan that, had the media darling from Tottenham, Glenn Hoddle, played it would have had camera crews, commentators and football writers in paroxysms of delight. Ronnie smashed the ball high into the net to send the game to extra-time. 

Cue Bob the motivator and psychologist. Obviously all the players from both sides were very tired. Bob though told all our lads to stay on their feet during the interval between full time and the extra thirty minutes. We had the upper hand now; let's keep it that way. Don't let the Spurs players see we were tired. Meanwhile, the Tottenham players looked a spent force. Lying all over the pitch, cramped-up muscles being massaged back to life. Manager and coaching staff putting consoling arms around the players, they did indeed look a sorry lot. Our players on the other hand looked raring to go. So it proved as another goal from Ronnie Whelan and one from Rushie confirmed our second successive League Cup success. Bob had pulled off a psychological stroke that Shanks himself would have been proud of. 

The last 25 League games of the season saw just two defeats and three draws. Bob's fifth League Championship was confirmed with a game to spare as Tottenham were defeated 3-1 at Anfield.",0,1411396302,null,0,false,0,ckpbclr,t3_2h4mmv,t1_ckpbclr,t3_2h4mmv,null,1426879085,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

With PR you can end up with a fragmented political structure, with many small parties and no overall control.  Looks at how many issues we've had with a two-party coalition, then consider what it would be like with 50 parties all trying to work together.  Your vote might ""count"" in the sense that the party you vote for might get into parliament, but if there are too many parties aiming for power your vote gets diluted so you still lose out.

Germany just about makes PR work these days, but PR is seen (not altogether fairly) as part of the reason the Nazis got into power (as it lets smaller extremist parties gain legitmisation in parliament).  Even now Germany has the ""five-percent clause"" which says a party must get at least 5% of the vote to be allowed into parliament... this is to stop extremist parties gaining a voice and to stop a flood of single-issue minor parties disrupting things.

Italy has had 62 governments since 1946 as coalitions join and collapse... this leads to legislative seizure and prevents things from moving forwards.  It can be argued that one of the advantages of FPTP is that it gives a party a five year run to get stuff done, which although you might personally not agree with the direction at least keeps the nation moving forwards.  As long as you have an effective opposition and appropriately powerful upper chamber this should prevent the worse excesses.

Frankly the problem is that people are SO disillusioned that they saw only a drastic, extreme option as realistic.

If there was a push for electoral reform with the same force as the independence campaign, it would happen. We had the referendum on FPTP/AV and it was rejected, mainly because the AV side did an absolutely wank job of campaigning on it and didn't convince anybody of the benefits.

What's the alternative though?  Do we really want families with young dependent children and without other sources of income subject to the tender mercies of the sanction-happy DWP?  We know that the economy isn't generating nearly enough jobs for everyone to do profitable work currently, and - leaving aside how well it's sometimes done - raising the next generation of taxpayers is undoubtedly work, damned hard work sometimes.  People are upset enough by the possible contribution of sanctions to the deaths of adults in the UK, they're likely to be more upset when kids start dying unnecessarily because families were unable to feed them.  I suppose you could run it in parallel with an uptick in taking children into 'care', but I'm not sure pulling children out of otherwise perfectly functional families just because they now lack resources and sending them to endure the horrors of the national child abuse system is a particularly preferable option.",0,1411397342,null,0,false,0,ckpbt77,t3_2h421t,t1_ckpbt77,t1_ckp6q39,null,1426878870,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

My point is that British writers are used to the one-story-split-across-one-season form, utlizing no episodic stories within each episode. So it's no surprise that the miniseries-style seasons of Torchwood were good. My whole point is that this 'continuous' story is something Britain is used to, be it from a mystery show to a political drama.

Look at State of Play, Broadchurch, and any number of acclaimed miniseries to see this is the case.

America has only just caught onto the proper miniseries structure that Britain has been writing for years now - most US shows still try to have some sort of episodic structure within the episodes rather than just tell one, single story without distractions. That's not a bad thing and it isn't meant as an insult, I just mean anything takes some getting used to and now America does seem more accepting of the form, some great things will come of it.

But the reason you think it's something new is because our miniseries didn't used to travel well before, BECAUSE US television was so tied up in episodic storytelling. Whenever something DID travel over, it was usually because it was adapted into a shorter film (State of Play) or was already episodic (The Office).",0,1411397905,null,0,false,0,ckpc2mw,t3_2h1u4o,t1_ckpc2mw,t1_ckpaug5,null,1426878749,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

They evolved from heraldic banners, and the English kings had started using the St George's cross by 1265: it represented them personally and their retainers rather than representing the lands that they ruled.

At the time that England and Wales came under the unified control of Edward I, the English monarchy also controlled Gascony. There's no contribution on the flag for Bordeaux, even though it would have as much claim as any other part. As borders were very dynamic then, changing the flag in response to conquest would have been a never ending job!

There was no objection to adding symbols to coats of arms to make pretensions of ownership - see the fleurs de lis claiming France which were only removed from the royal coat of arms in 1801. The fact that Edward didn't add lions quarterly (as the dragon was not a contemporary Welsh symbol) to his emblems shows that it was not felt necessary to establish that it was his domain.

The Union Flag represents the fact that there was a union of crowns, with James I / VI ""owning"" both the St George's and St Andrew's flags. The fact that they are both related to patron saints is fairly coincidental - they are unmistakable geometric devices which combine well.

I accept that a lot of people commute into London, but look at any city in the world, people commute into all of them. If you are buying or selling things you want to go where most people will be, and we will always need more services to be provided in cities than can just be sustained by people living simply in that city. Also it makes economic sense, if it costs you less to commute in and live outside of the city then people may choose to do that. Once again, London is not unique in this.

false,flapjackcarl,lfc99,,"There's almost two questions here: the first is what to do with having allen and can currently injured. In that case we pretty much have to play gerrard. 

One thing I would like to see is a midfield diamond with Lucas at the base and lallana and hendo in front. (Or gerrard for lucas). Our  only deep lying midfielders that are fit right now are woefully immobile. One way to compensate is to surround them with hard working midfielders that can track back and help cover runs.

Once allen is back, I think it becomes a rotational issue. Gerrard can't play all game every game, so the question becomes how do we lineup without him.i think a double pivot with hendo and allen and coutinho at the tip (he does a fairly good job of tracking back) would be interesting to see.

Tl; DR, for now keep gerrard, but surround him with more mobile players to shield the defense. When allen returns, then rotate gerrard. 

Of course, this all depends on how the team adapts to one another. People forget that we started 5 players who are new to the team on Saturday (I'm counting borini), three of which are defenders. It's going to take time to gel (not to mention we've played two top 4 contenders and 3 of the more difficult mid table sides) ",0,1411399393,null,0,false,0,ckpcsde,t3_2h4d9v,t1_ckpcsde,t3_2h4d9v,null,1426878370,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

no, IT wants *experience* above anything else. Having a degree also loses you a chunk of your paycheck paying the costs back.

His running doesn't seem as effective and our whole team pressing is inefficient. We don't win the ball back in the early phases of the opponents attack. 

I think this is a symptom of us losing our talismanic striker and having lots of injuries. Luis Suarez always led the team from the front and started the press. He was efficient in his movement. Balotelli presses a little bit, but he is nowhere near the intensity of Luis. This leaves Gerrard more exposed because we have to defend deeper.

They'd already practised their craft and while it may be one of the longer miniseries out there, again, the form had been tried-and-tested on British TV to the point where Miracle Day really wasn't the big new achievement you're painting it to be.

That's not an insult to Miracle Day or Torchwood in general by itself - I actually love the season, but I understand it wasn't some big, new thing that'd never been done before and the writers did not create a new form, they just extended what was already there by a couple of hours. But considering most miniseries are already many hours long, that's not really a big deal. i.e - a four-episode miniseries in the UK usually has episodes that are 90mins-2hrs long, already putting the average British miniseries at 6-8hrs.

yes - having a few years experience is much more valuable.

&gt; Do you think it's worth taking this apprenticeship if i want to eventually get into the networking side of things? I don't want to be stuck doing IT support jobs but there aren't any network apprenticeships in London or anywhere in the south. 


Networking is a weird one, there'll be some networking in any IT support jobs, but its rare to go directly into it these days. It's not  impossible  though - for example you could go support job for 2-3 years,  -&gt; datacentre support job  -&gt; junior networking job pretty easily I think.

Cameron has plenty of people who can slow him down... he has a cabinet, he has a wider parliamentary party, he has the opposition parties, he has the Lords, and ultimately he has to face the public in an election every five years.  The fact you refer to his ""stupid"" ideas is part of the problem... any political idea can be viewed as stupid if you're on the other side of the political spectrum.

People will have two jobs each offering variable hours. So maybe twenty hours a week in a pub and whatever else you can fit around that with a catering agency. On top of that you get tips. This means you're working say 40 hours a week. Assuming minimum wage that's about 260 pound plus tips.

According to this you can get a room in clapham/battersea SW11 for 114 a week. That's walking distance to clapham junction station from where you can get pretty much anywhere in london in less than an hour.

So most people are simultaneously immoral and moral in their political leanings, in the same way religious and non-religious people are all going to one religions hell probably.

The reason the conservatives are less popular is because conservative morality does not envelop social justice (in fact, conservatism sees 'social justice' as broadly irrelevant - the idea is that natural mechanisms will give you what you deserve). Younger people are far, far more likely to both be a) educated about issues around social justice (poverty, discrimination, marginalisation and so on) b) care about those issues. 

That's because we have a more 'lefty' education system these days where kids are taught about gay relationships, where they have to confront racism, etc. and additionally because their perspectives are narrower to them these issues are bigger.

The beam which destroyed the Sycorax ship was fired from five different locations around London, suggesting a number of properties are owned by Torchwood One in the area. The tower installations were destroyed during the events of ""[Doomsday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_(Doctor_Who\))"". According to the *Torchwood* website, there were 823 members of staff, of which only 27 were known to have survived. In the wake of the ""Battle of Canary Wharf"", [Her Majesty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II) ordered the immediate closure of Torchwood One.  Some of the notable employees included:

I started at 12K (13.5K now) and have had to continue living at home, that while not ideal I believe will be worth it in the long run. My apprenticeship is in engineering (rail specifically), and I gain NVQ's and Lvl 3 Btec from it, which will hopefully serve me well in future career. I'm now roughly 9 months away from completing my 3 year apprenticeship, where my wage will increase to 35K. 

What I'm taking most from my Apprenticeship though is not the education, its the experience and 'history' for my CV. This is where I personally think apprenticeships are most useful for, gaining and showing experience to future employers. Hopefully setting you aside from grads in the future. The short term low pay is definitely worth it in my opinion, as it can hopefully put you in a position for higher wage later in your career.

But in the end this all depends on the company and the apprenticeship it offers. If it seems shit and just wanting a low wage employee, don't take it. Its worth getting real world experience and finding a better apprenticeship later on, 18 is still young.

Edit: Whenever i see Lucas playing a role where he is attacking offensively outside the opponents box, i cry a little.  It is mind boggling a top flight team doesn't have management that can see how bad it is.  He has played there multiple times, and i bet he will play there more this season.  This is what worries me the most about Liverpool.  I can take a bad game, i can't take terrible terrible decision making.

The whole slow privatisation of public services is what I expect from the Tories, but labour seem to be allowing it in a trickle down economics which I don't think the party should represent. Though even as rivals I think conservative have become too helpful in corporate interests than their old party political ways of tory values, so kinda disappointed in them too. 

I think UKIP are a symptom of both parties losing their political soul, but I think UKIP is worse on levels of dangerous incompetence than either party. So part of me hopes both parties wake up and stop pandering to the press and who shout loudest, and re gain some life back into each other. Rather than trusting new party or a new system, who seem worst than before.

I'd like to hope even as a left winger you can have good gap of difference between UKIP and Tories. Just UKIP is more crazier rejects of the conservatives who have no shame or political soul and will pretty much sell themselves for seats. Any party left or right, which claims to not be like other parties gets instant no trust from me. 

I think Europe has gone lil too right wing (and even going lil too left wing would have problems) it's better with a slight wobbly balance. UKIP are a representation of a party lil too much to one side where policies would be damaging.
I only hate it on this sub when it gets too like that, too much nationalism and too much blaming problems on one easy scape goat, which can sometimes attract obvious or slightly hidden bigotry.

false,Roods,England,Hertfordshire - '07 GSXR 600,"Considering this is your first track day you don't need to worry about tyre warmers, as already mentioned just take it easy and build up your speed slowly as you get familiar with the track. A few other general tips:

Before the track day:

* Get a good nights sleep the night before, track days can be incredibly tiring
* Check over the bike and make sure your tyres have plenty of tread, your brake pads have plenty of life in them, in fact giving it a quick service before is a good idea
* Have a decent breakfast, avoid the temptation of a fry up and go for something light but energy packed (fruit, cereal, etc)
* Remember to bring both parts of your licence, the organiser can refuse you entry onto the track without them!
* Depending on the kind of bike you have and if you have an aftermarket exhaust, I would recommend putting on the stock can; noise limits at UK tracks have become stricter in the last couple of years with a lot of tracks enforcing a 102db limit. 

At the track:

* During the briefing pay attention; they will explain what the various flags mean and the various rules of the track
* Don't look at the speedo and (if you haven't already) tuck in or remove those side mirrors: when overtaking it is up to the person overtaking to perform a clean and safe pass, the person who is being overtaken should only concentrate and maintaining a clean line and shouldn't need mirrors to look behind them
* Always remember there's someone on the track that's faster than you; avoid racing others on the circuit it'll only end in tears (and possibly a wrecked bike)
* Depending on which group you're in (Novice/Intermediate/Advanced) and how quickly/slowly you learn, you may find that you are faster or slower than the group you're currently in. Its perfectly ok to ask the organisers to move you into another group if you feel the group you're in isn't suitable
* Most track day organisers usually have instructors at the track that can follow you/lead, they can be a great help in learning the various lines as well as being able to critique your riding and give you tips on how to improve
* Your tyres will get much warmer when track riding compared to riding on the road, resulting in the air in your tyres expanding to a greater degree. Assuming your running average PSI for the street (generally around 35psi depending on the tyre and bike) its worth dropping the tyre pressure to around 30psi. There is usually someone at the track who fits tyres and has an air compressor so you can re-inflate the tyres at the end of the day
