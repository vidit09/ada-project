Firstly have a look at [this](http://www.dofe.org/en/content/cms/doing-your-dofe/activities-sections/expedition/20-conditions/) This is the list of what criteria Assessors look for in when assessing you expedition.

*Do we have safety officers?* - Your exped must be accompanied by an adult who is able to accept responsibility for your safety and that of you team.

*How long do you walk for?* - There used to be a minimum distance for the walking expeditions, not any more. For Gold you must have 8 hours of planned activity for the day, half of which must be spent traveling. The other hours of planned activity can be related to your exped aim.

*Do you need to be relatively fit to do well on the expedition?* Depends on the route you are taking. All Gold expeditions must take place in one of the [Wild Country areas](https://www.dofe.org/en/content/cms/leaders/expedition-areas/) You will have to complete a practice expedition before hand of similar duration and difficulty before presenting yourself for assessment. Gold expeditions I've seen tend to do about 20km a day for 4 days. Remember you will be carrying all your gear with you.

*What is the most fun part of the expedition?* I found my Gold expeditions extremely rewarding in terms of the teamwork and the bond you form with the people you do it with. Different people get different things out of it. You won't know till you try.

Anything else I can answer if I can.

false,DanniiTheFannii,,The Guy In The Sidebar (Year 12 - Mod),"I used a variety of methods. Textbooks, revision guides (namely CGP) - the works. However, I think the most valuable resource for anyone are the past papers. Sadly, these are limited - so use them wisely. I may have mentioned this before, but the exam is a game. I'm telling you, you could know every single text book inside and out for your exams and you still won't get full marks. I remember for my biology B2 (?) exam, I was asked this: *define osmosis*. Now, of course, should you know every book inside out then you'll be able to get full marks, but you wouldn't know *why* or where the marks are coming from. So:

Osmosis is the **movement of water particles** from a **dilute solution to a concentrated solution** across a **partially permeable membrane.** 

And there you have it. Each bold statement = 1 mark. I know that because I could visualise the mark scheme in my head and knew what the examiner was looking for. 

Examiner reports are good. My biology/physics teacher for this year told me to read up on a few of them. They're pretty useful, believe it or not. 

One method that I used to use was just writing shit out from a text book on a piece of paper, basically having two copies of a book. That was useful, sure. I would condense the notes and eventually have smaller pieces of things to revise from. It can get a bit boring. I'm rather fond of revision, but that definitely did get a bit boring I must admit.  
So what I do now are mind maps. These fuckers are great. Look through a book, make key points in note form, link the ideas. It's fucking perfect; easy to access and easy to understand information. I then turn over the piece of paper and write paragraphs about each point - explaining the different things as though I were in an exam. This means that I have another resource to look at **and** I'm writing it out a second time, so it's sticking in my head even better! 

I find that often there are a lot of revision videos on YouTube. I found out after my exams (helpful..) that there's some guy called MyGCSEscience and he deals with the AQA science board. Apparently he's really good, but I've never checked out his videos before. I've since searched up revision videos for A level, and it's just another person explaining things to you - as well as working them out and you can pause or rewind or watch them again.

Although it's probably just a case of him doing whatever he can to help himself, if it means working with Murdoch then it's a bit morally questionable in my opinion.

The second reason was after watching the documentary ""You've Been Trumped"". The local council for the area rejected Mr. Trump's attempts to get planning permission for his giant luxury golf course. Alex Salmond then plays a major part in overruling the councils decision and green-lighting the development, to the disappointment of those who will be displaced by Trump's plans.

Went to a pub with my mate in Sheppey to have a pint and play some billiards. Ordered a whiskey at the bar and this snarky barmaid asked to see my ID. I was 19 at the time so I figured there'd be no problem at all. So I tried using my drivers license, she returned it to me and said she didn't recognize where my license was from... My first thought was perhaps I'd run into the only person in the UK that doesn't know where Florida is... But alright, I don't want to cause a scene... So next I tried using my US military ID. She told me it was fake! At that point I felt like she was just discriminating against me for being American/foreign, so just to spite her I pulled out my UK passport. That REALLY pissed her off because she didn't even look at my passport before blowing up on me telling me that my passport was fake and that I needed to leave before she called the police. I asked to speak to the owner of the pub and she refused to comply. My mate tried vouching for me telling her that all of my ID's were real and that she was being a cunt. She told him to leave as well and to never come back. So we left and went to a different pub down the road.

It's still frustrating to think about... But in the end I had the last laugh because during my last trip I discovered that the pub went out of business.

false,cyborg_selkie,null,null,"You're absolutely right. To be fair, there's probably not much politicians can do about long-term economic problems, especially considering the difficulty of implementing long-term solutions is one of the laws of having a democratic system of government. 

However, I still think Labour's rationale for wanting schools to teach ""character"" is a prime example of why they're doing so poorly. The idea that British children would do better in the workforce if they were taught to be ""Churchill-tough"" in school seems to be pandering to more conservative voters, who quite possibly won't vote Labour regardless of how much the party tries to pander to them. 

While the larger trend of lack of jobs isn't something that can be easily fixed, Hunt mentions two factors affecting class mobility that can be ameliorated: university placement, and apprenticeships that favour the rich. Having solutions for these issues would probably win Labour support from many middle class voters. Yet, oddly, Hunt mentions these things, then blows them off to say ""Well, the state educated children will be able to handle these adversities if they were just tougher,"" which doesn't make sense. No one's going to give a uni grad a cost of living stipend to do a full-time internship in London just because they have strong moral fibre. 

So, again, this is why Labour can't have nice things: they're putting out nonsense proposals in an attempt to pander to everyone, but end up pandering to no one instead. ",0,1417964097,null,0,false,0,cmnsnx8,t3_2oiexr,t1_cmnsnx8,t1_cmnr59o,null,1425559340,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

false,gangstafrog,null,null,"Yeah, no. I can't get on board with that. I fail to see any sort of mockery here, and to perceive all of the compliments here and the purpose of the article that way is extremely petty, defensive and paranoid. 

It's individuals who don't have any professional standing, career on the line or anything to do with the club other than their general support who come up with such petty reasons and perceptions of things like this. I understand tabloid journalism to be about sensationalism, things like ""SUAREZ BITES EVERYONE"" headlines and stories that don't offer much. This article discusses past youth players who I'd wager many of the people who have joined this sub and or started following LFC in the last year or two have never even heard of. 

The stretch from what is mentioned in the article to *they are essentially saying ""they were too shit for LFC, now lets see what unfortunate League 1 team they've washed up on for our entertainment.""* is a massive one and it's only the people of the aforementioned traits that are doing it. If you have no idea who these people are or what they did, and want to personally dismiss their efforts as ""they were too shit for LFC"", that's up to you. But it's not a horrible article because of flawed perceptions of it.

If the article actually said the things it's being accused of, it'd be different. But mockery is not really relative, this isn't satire.

As for 'click bait' and 'getting views' - these are all your opinion. 

Technically, all articles are for getting views, it's the internet. Click bait is a relative term, if you feel baited by an article discussion previous players, nobody can argue against it. If your argument intends to dissect what is and isn't defined as bait, the substance of a topic to be considered newsworthy media as far as your tastes go, etc, you can have those *entirely petty and general arguments which cannot be won* with a few select folks.

Neither of you speak on behalf of what I'm saying really, insisting that it's a mockery doesn't make it (especially while backing the guy who says 'even though they didn't call them names or make accusations', you know, actual mockery) so and again, put **reason** behind your opinion. 

It's not the way *you* want them to act, everything being cited against this article is a comparison to something exaggerated. You define this article as negative, and cite no reason.  Show me the part where slide #598 says ""Remember Hamill, yeah, he was shit, right?"" and then it moves on to the next slide. 

Otherwise, back off and be more respectful to some of the only publicized  credit these kids ever probably got/will get. They all deserve the recognition of having been selected to at least *try* (if not feature) for the club you support - how do you end up finding something to be mad, offended, disappointed or whathaveyou by?

&gt;Wilmer, who was himself abused as a child, has denied that he intended the email to be threatening. His email, which has been seen by the Observer, suggests he was provoked into emailing Lavery by a social media row between a separate abuse victim and his adult son, Rory, who had sought to confront those who criticised his father’s place on the panel.

&gt;In his email, which accuses his critics of “crossing the line”, he writes: “I’m looking forward to meeting you on Friday. I’ve watched and listened to your media interviews over the past few days, and I’ve looked at all the Twitter feeds you and Ian [McFadyen] have pumped out. The insults you have issued about me, I have no problem with; you are entitled to your opinion. However, what has been said about my son, Rory, is a different matter.”

Other than that the article is quoting a lawyer's letter in response.

This one should have been the focus of the article:

[Star-Lord Background](#s ""Peter Quill is born during an unusual astronomical phenomenon when many of the planets align. Seeing no resemblance, the man who believed he was Quill's father accuses his wife Meredith of infidelity and attempts to kill the infant, but dies of a sudden heart attack. Quill is raised by his single mother until she is killed by an alien when he is eleven. Quill is placed in an orphanage but escapes and eventually becomes a trainee NASA astronaut. An alien entity called the Master of the Sun later visits the space station that Quill and other astronauts are inhabiting, and offers the mantle of Star-Lord (an interplanetary policeman) to a worthy candidate. Quill volunteers, but is rejected in favor of a colleague he once treated badly. Quill is outraged, and NASA orders his return to Earth and discharge for his conduct. Instead, he steals a scout ship, returns to the space station, and takes his colleague's place. Quill becomes Star-Lord, with the Master of the Sun first creating an illusion in which the character is able to find and kill the aliens that murdered his mother to free him of his past. Equipped with a sentient vessel called ""Ship"", Quill commences his role as Star-Lord."")",0,1417965738,null,0,false,0,cmnt6qp,t3_2oju4n,t1_cmnt6qp,t3_2oju4n,null,1425559098,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

So, at the moment there is a mountain of food avaliable that gets thrown away, while most poor people buy food which gives the supermarkets profit. 

This legislation will take that big mountain of food and give it to foodbanks to help people with. Considering large numbers of people in the country are poor and would use foodbanks if they could, but the avaliability of food is limited by a lack of food, the result of the foodbanks lots of food will be that more people will use the foodbanks. This will include lots of poor people who are struggling to pay their bills but who used to buy food from the supermarkets. The result of them getting food from the foodbank will therefore be a hit to the supermarket's profits. This is why they don't do it now.

Forcing them to do so is not just going to lead to an unconditional surrender. They are going to maximise their profits. That is done by making sure as many people as possible buy their food. If this means taking efforts with other supermarkets to make sure that the amount of spare food is as small as possible they are going to do it.

&gt;We got the two goals and got the win it means a lot to the lads and it means a lot to me to get back on the scoresheet. Until you score you don't feel like you are back but now I've scored I am definitely back.

&gt;It is great to win three in a week, it is massive boost and it is a great thing for the club to achieve.

&gt;It is never a good sign going behind but we have fought back twice in a week to get the points, which is fantastic.

&gt;It was a great feeling, it is fantastic to be back on the pitch and play as many games as I have in the last few weeks. There is nothing better than scoring goals as a striker, so I was desperate to get a goal and it is great feeling.

&gt;You always have to just think about the positives [when injured], the medical staff have helped me a lot and it is credit to them that I am back.

&gt;It is a great group of lads, they and the manager are over the moon, he is doing great at the minute. We just have to reach for the top and that is what we are doing, working as hard as we can to give performances like today.

Gary Monk's reaction:

&gt;We were not at the level we have been. We very much competed, it was close but we were not at the level we were and some of the mistakes have cost us. Funnily enough when we went down to 10 men we played or better football.

&gt;When we play one touch football we can hurt teams and we showed that with our goal but we did not do that enough. Andy Carroll's first goal was from a very good cross but we lost him for the second goal, which you cannot do against any team, that is the sort of chance he waits for. The third goal was very poor defending from us.

&gt;He handballs it to get past Lukasz. Whether the referee saw the handball or not you would have to ask the referee. Lukasz tried to stop himself but the handball took Sakho past the keeper. We will sit down and have a think, if it was the cold hard facts we would [appeal] but we will have to think about it.

EDIT: Aaaand Big Sam:

&gt;The disappointing thing was the first attack Swansea scored but we fought back. If you did not feel like you could jump out of bed and get down here to play football there would be something wrong but the way we expressed ourselves and the quality of the goals was very much what we deserved.

&gt;Even though there was controversy with the sending off the result always deserved to be ours.

&gt;For us another three goals in the bag and a big eight days - nine points - I don't think anyone in the Premier League has done that this week. We are really flying, we have a lot of players fit. The way Alex Song controls that midfield for us is brilliant. He gets the right service to the front men. We will enjoy ourselves for a day or two and get ourselves ready for the next game

&gt;It is massive for Andy Carroll. Movement in the box is what it is all about, the heading in the box only comes after the movement is right and that happened with his two goals. He is unstoppable when he gets that space. Hopefully he continues to learn that way. We don't need Andy to score goals with our heads, we are very dangerous on set pieces and with players in wide areas. We cause defenders huge problems.

&gt;It goes to the next game and to try and win it and until we get to the end of January and move out of the congested fixture list and stay with a strong squad that is fit - somewhere along the line they will all have to play their part - as they have in this wonderful run and to go with one defeat in nine shows what a good squad we have.",0,1417967110,null,0,1417967759,0,cmnto0j,t3_2ojyrs,t1_cmnto0j,t3_2ojyrs,null,1425558873,15,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,15

false,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"&gt;By any standards George Osborne’s period as chancellor has been dismal for Britain. He started the job as the economy was beginning to recover from the recession. In the previous two British recessions, the first three years of recovery produced increases in output per head of over 8%. Between 2010 and 2013 Britain managed only 2% growth.

&gt;Economists will long debate just how much of this disastrous performance was down to the man running the Treasury. But a significant part clearly was. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), Britain’s fiscal watchdog, estimates—conservatively—that growth in both 2010-11 and 2011-12 was 1% lower than it would have been without fiscal austerity. The mistake was to try to reduce the deficit when interest rates were stuck at their zero lower bound. We can only speculate about quite why this mistake was made.

Only buying players who are proven in the Premier league is not the answer. Bony has been pretty decent for Swansea, right? Are Pelle and Tadic both flops at Southampton? The issue here isn't that none of the players had premier league experience, the issue is that we bought too many and a lot of them were not suited for the style the manager wanted to play. 

What we desperately need is better communication between our manager and the rest of the transfer committee; this also means that we need to stop sacking our managers every 8-12 months so that we can get some stability through the system and our side.

Paying brings in a whole different load of problems, mainly that on most pay sites a lot of the profiles are from non-paying members who can't respond anyway, and the majority of sites won't tell you whether you're messaging paying members or not, I've been successful enough with free sites like OK cupid and POF so I've only ever done free trials at paid sites and I seriously wouldn't consider paying until you're at least getting a good number of responses on free sites.

Don't write too much in messages, literally just 1 line, if you mention something in her profile great (For example, if she says she likes making cakes say ""Hey, How's your weekend going? Been getting much chance to bake?""or something) , but to be honest, I've not noticed much difference in response between whether I mention things that are in their profile or not. 99% of whether she will respond or not will be based on your profile, not your message and there's no point putting any more effort in it than that.

Chances are there's something off with your profile that's causing your lack of responses, I spent a month or so tweaking my profile and changing which photos I used and I got about about a 200% increase in the number of responses I got just by using better (more interesting) photos (the /r/OkCupid subreddit is really good for getting profile appraisals, if you're not on OKC just transplant your profile to that  site and submit it to get people's opinions, then take down the link once you've got some feedback ). Its not a bad idea to do a search for men that fit your description...see what the competition is like!

Think about who you're messaging - if you're only messaging really hot girls, they get a fuck tonne of messages, so even if you're a model yourself you're still going to get lost in the noise. Also several of my female friends have told me they basically just have online dating profiles for a confidence boost, and they have no real plan of using them unless some absolute dream perfect man started talking to them, its the same with Tinder.

Just an FYI I maybe get a 10-20% initial response rate, which is pretty good I think, but then maybe 30% of the girls who respond will stop responding within 3 messages, but then I'm equally bad at responding to girls who message me first but I'm not really interested in, I might fire off one message but then I stop so I think it goes both ways. Of the girls I actually end up having a good conversation with I'll maybe go on a date with 50% of them, and of the 10 girls I've gone on dates with (from online dating) I've ended up having a relationship with 2, although once you actually have a date then that's a whole different ball game obviously.

So my advice would be to make sure your profile shows you in the best light possible then don't send out 100s of messages but just find girls that seem to have put a fair bit of effort into their profiles and have been online recently (as they're most likely to respond) and have similar interests, and fire off a brief message and never think about that profile again.

What betrayal?

The simple truth of the matter is that the demographics of Northern Ireland are shifting, Protestants no longer have an overall majority of the population and will likely be overtaken by Catholics within the next few decades. If political unionism is to survive this shift then their leaders need to do a much better job of reaching out to the Catholic community that distrusts them. But they're not doing that, instead they have thrown their support behind Orange Order parades and protests about flags.

as it is, traditionally i think this side of education would be left to parents and sometimes the church, but seeing as both parents working is now prettymuch the norm, and the church is an irrelevance, what's filling the void? seems to me the answer is consumerism/entertainment, which doesnt really have much of a motive to instill good character in people, these interests want entitled, hyperconsumerist, overgrown children to make maximum profits from.

as for your idea about 6 months in a supermarket i think that's not a bad idea at all, though maybe would become a bit of a joke where the supermarkets just take the piss and all original purpose is lost in favour of profit on their part. national service (lol if i didnt nuke this comment before i've done it now) seems like quite a good idea to me aswell, not necessarily military but just a period in some public service, to teach some cameraderie, teamwork, civic mindedness in an environment where it isnt all about them. would help reverse the class system a bit by putting all different types of people in together in a shared experience, getting to know each other. would give an experience that they could take some pride in, helping their self confidence and self efficacy, would also teach them a few practical skills and provide a bit of utility to wider society. a bit of a disadvantage to some of the high flyers but hugely beneficial i think to the kids at the bottom of the pile.",0,1417971212,null,0,false,0,cmnvbe1,t3_2oiexr,t1_cmnvbe1,t1_cmnu1ge,null,1425558103,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

 IIRC the legal situation is car drivers have a high duty of care, which gets them in trouble even if the pedestrian acts stupidly, but the green cross code makes clear that for practical purposes vehicles assume right of way on the road. But regardless, it doesn't matter what the laws are; in a contest they get a dent and you... You definitely lose.

Anyway, when you go to cross you need to pay attention to maybe a handful of big cars and it's quite straightforward. To the car you are far smaller and they have a hundred other things to be paying attention to, many of which are moving fast and things can happen quite suddenly. That car you're focusing 75% of your attention on, until you step onto the road the driver is maybe giving you, what, &lt;5%?  

At any given time a lot of the cars in Edinburgh are not familiar with driving in the city and it is hard for them just getting into lane. Many of the other drivers are city drivers i.e. much more aggressive than you'll find outside it. I don't drive all that much, but I've done enough in the city centre to even consider taking any risks as a pedestrian. Some guys out there, for example at the Leopold Place (Leith walk/London road roundabout) crossing, particularly around 8-9am where every other pedestrian just runs out in front of anything rather than wait for the lights, you guys are suicidal. 

Going back to the specific point about the intersection, I really can't think of anywhere that doesn't have some kind of crossing aid whilst also having enough traffic for it to be a problem just to wait a moment and pick your opportunity to cross safely. Actually I just thought of one, but it's a high traffic area and the geography of the intersection offers little visibility, which makes it a very poor choice for pedestrians, so they put the crossings a bit further up the road.

Just got back from Upton Park and was that a whirlwind of a match. 

All I could think about is how this season is so much easier to sit through. Matches are exciting. We're playing excellent football with a variety of players.

I did initially say that Song was rusty, however he has transformed my view of him. So casual. believes in his ability and really controls the game. I don't think I saw him head the ball away all game. He ALWAYS chests it down, retains possession and finds a ball.

Sahko was dynamite from the second he came on. The Fabiankski red card was right in front of me and Sahko deserves plaudits for being fouled but continuing and nearly rolling the ball in from an impossible angle, unlucky bounce of the post. Deserved his goal. 

Caroll, while being a bit shoddy on the deck today, showed his innate strength in the air.  

Funny thing I noticed today. While Bony is a great player. Fast, strong, and very capable. He is terrible in the air. He just mistimes his leap every time. Makes him awkward to go up for a header with, however he never seems to make contact (well not today).

That is a stupid question but in my generosity I answer it below.

&gt; Protestants no longer have an overall majority of the population and
&gt; will likely be overtaken by Catholics within the next few decades.

Protestants never had an overall majority in Ireland, yet it was ruled
through them by England for centuries.

&gt; If political unionism is to survive this shift then their leaders
&gt; need to do a much better job of reaching out to the Catholic
&gt; community that distrusts them.

The Protestants were put in Ireland for one and only one purpose: to
subdue it to England's rule, which they did well.  'Reaching out' is
not applicable.  Why on Earth would the Catholics ever trust them?

&gt; ...their influence will only dwindle further. And it will not be
&gt; because the British government betrayed them

It will be for that reason and no other.  It is preposterous to
suppose that Unionism and Republicanism can ever coexist amicably.  No
such bizarre aspiration was in contemplation when Ireland was last
pacified by England, under ""Bloody Balfour"".  England upheld Unionism
by hanging troublemakers, not by 'reaching out'.

The prospect of Ireland being used by another power to attack England
is now so remote that the Unionist have been deemed, like their Harki
counterparts, surplus to requirements.  After centuries of service for
England they are being discarded as a remnant of something that
enlightened opinion would prefer to forget: that is the betrayal.

The shirt is a simple button-down dress shirt, either white or very pale shades of red or blue. As for pants, skinny black dress pants or black jeans are good, preferably jeans.  

Now the bow tie, one of the crucial parts: If you're willing to lay down a bit of money for a well-made bowtie, and one that's screen-accurate to boot, I've ordered many ties from the [Mrs. Bow Tie](http://www.mrsbowtie.com/search.php?search_query=Dr.+Who&amp;page=1&amp;section=product#results) site. The service is good and they deliver in less than four days. The catch is that they're about forty dollars apiece. If that's too much money then [the tie bar](http://www.thetiebar.com/) is one alternative. [This tie](http://www.thetiebar.com/product/B1760) actually looks pretty good. They're a fraction of the price of Mrs. Bow Tie ties, but  I've never purchased from them, so I can't testify to their quality.

Finally the footwear. The originals are a pair of black leather boots that look like [this](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4ImWqExnRHY/S2MTHTGKeHI/AAAAAAAADd8/5PSfdW1msHM/s1600/0007t17t.jpeg), but they're really difficult to find. My cosplaying standards are rather low when it comes  to shoes, so if you can't find a pair of suitable looking boots, try some black dress shoes. And if THAT falls through, wear a pair of black converse or Converse knock-offs. Not at all accurate, but I like Converse.

If you are willing to go the extra mile for Victorian-style 11, whose costume I happen to be fonder of, you could order the [officially licensed coat](http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/14c3/) off of Thinkgeek, but it's very expensive. I've never purchased it, so research it first. There are [knock-offs](http://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Eleventh-Purple-Cosplay-Costume/dp/B00M93TJ58/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417972272&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=doctor+who+frock) but I've never purchased them either.

Finally, an optional part of the Victorian 11 costume is the grey vest he wears. For Victorian-style vests you can't beat Gentleman's Emporium. You could try [this vest](http://www.gentlemansemporium.com/store/003865.php) or [this vest](http://www.gentlemansemporium.com/store/005908.php).

Many do come and struggle, but I would argue that as many change teams in the league and struggle as well. It isn't as black and white as that. Just look at Hull, QPR,  and Liverpool etc this season.

&gt;And of the 7 we bought with the Bale money, none have thrived. None (with maybe the exception of Eriksen) have been worth the money spent on them.

Again, I don't disagree with you that most of the signings have been poor - but I don't think they were poor because they all lacked premier league experience, I think they were poor because there were too many of them and there was no clear idea as to how all these new signings were supposed to fit into a system. 

Eriksen for £11m was a steal, we did vote him player of the season last year, he's gotten 5 goals so far this year and has the most chances created so far in the entire league (our attackers fault they can't convert). While he had a poor first season £7m for Chadli wasn't too bad either considering he now has 6 goals in 10 games this season.

Merits: Ambidextrous, Area Of Expertise (History, Machines, Time Travel, Astrology, Astronomy), Quick Draw, Disarm, Encyclopedic Knowledge, Common Sense, Danger Sense, Direction Sense, Fighting Finesse (Swords), Striking Looks 2, Inspiring, Well-Traveled, Fast Reflexes 2, Fleet of Foot 3, Iron Stamina 3, Heavy Weapons 5, Psychic Resistance 3, Indomitable, Hedgespun Weapon 5 (Time Lord Sword: +6 Equipment, +2 Defense), Hedgespun Raiment 5 (Time Lord Clothes: Empathy +2, Persuasion +2, Subterfuge +1), Harvest (Emotions 5, Pledges 5), Token 2 (Psychic Paper), Pledgesmith 3, Token Maker 5*, Hollow 10 (Size 5, Amenities 3, Wards 2; located inside the TARDIS), Workshop 5 (Machines 5)

*The target number of successes is decreased to 15 per dot of the token, but requires Wyrd 6. He rolls Wyrd + Crafts + Machines Specialty w/ Area Of Expertise + Workshop bonus + Sonic Screwdriver bonus = 38 dice. Also, he automatically rerolls the failed dice without spending glamour, as per the Wyrd 7 blessing of the Artist kith.

Health: 9

Willpower: 9

Defense: 4

Initiative Mod: 10

Speed: 15

Wyrd: 8

Contracts: Artifice 6, Stone 3, Hours 4, Verdant Spring 4, Spellbound Autumn 3, Vainglory 3, Four Directions 2, Goblin (Trading Luck For Fate, Diviner’s Madness, Delayed Harm, Good And Bad Luck)

Max Glamour/Per Turn: 30/8

Frailties: skin contact or ingestion of ginger (major bane), skin contact or ingestion of Aspirin (major bane), must not interfere with the stability of Time (minor taboo), must not harm his companions (minor taboo)

Mien Blessings: Music Of The Spheres (Telluric), Panomancy (Oracle), Impeccable Craftsmanship (Artist)

Fae Aspects:

Partially Immortal Flesh: Bashing damage still affects the Doctor. Cold-forged iron causes Aggravated damage, should someone be skilled enough to strike him with such. He does not need to eat or sleep, nor is he affected by diseases and poisons, unless they are magical or one of his frailties.

Change of Heart: The True Fae are entities almost embodied by their passions and vices, with higher morality and self-denial little more than a whim to them. For them, passion is virtue, and the denial of passion an affectation. Their supernaturally amoral nature is reflected in an inverted ability to regain Willpower. They regain one Willpower point from indulging their Virtue, but refresh their whole pool when satiating their Vice.

The Doctor, on the other hand, has spent enough time on the mortal world to absorb part of humanity’s nature. He can remain on Earth without suffering damage, regains Willpower normally, can harvest Glamour from selfless emotions, can create Hedgespun items and does not have the Skill limits of most True Fae. However, his mindset is still very much alien, and thus he has no Morality or Clarity meter, nor can his strange thought processes be represented by Derangements, as is the case with the other True Fae.

Regeneration: The Doctor can completely heal himself when severely ill or wounded. He may also do this at will if necessary. This process causes changes in appearance, virtue, vice, attributes, skills and merits. New Fae Aspects and Mien Blessings may manifest. He may only use this ability twelve times. Temporary side effects may include amnesia, black outs, erratic behavior and loss of motor control.

Advanced Automatons: the Doctor gains the following benefits when building Hedgespun automatons - Attributes cost one dot rating instead of two, their Mental and Social dice pools are not limited to 4 dice, they have a Seeming and up to 2 kiths, they start with Wyrd 3 and can have up to Wyrd 5 by spending 2 Merit dots per Wyrd point, they can use tokens, can enter the Hedge, can swear Pledges, have Virtues and Vices, they start with 5 dots of Contracts and can have more by spending 1 Merits dot per new clause (maximum 20), total xp cost divided by half. So, such an automaton who has Wyrd 5, Strength 3 and Brawl 3 would have a dot rating of 9 and cost 9 xp instead of 18.

Titles: the Doctor (Actor), TARDIS (mobile Realm), Sonic Screwdriver (Prop)

The Tell: the Doctor’s Tells are eccentric clothing, mannerisms, technologies and accessories. Colorful question marks may also appear. 

The Doctor: he looks like a man of varying appearance. In his Mien, he is always illuminated by tiny stars, galaxies, nebulae and planets that appear and disappear. His eyes, although normal, can cause a person to become lost in them, as if they were abysses into every experience of his extremely long life. His Fae Weakness is having both his hearts destroyed. 

TARDIS: the entrance to this Realm looks like a police call box. The inside is a giant computer station filled with strange technologies, beings and relics from different places and eras. This Realm is capable of flying and traveling through space and time, as well as entering the Hedge. The Doctor automatically arrives at his chosen location and time period, unless the ST says otherwise. Other characters may use the TARDIS if the Doctor teaches them how to operate it.

Sonic Screwdriver: this small handheld device has a large number of uses (see below). The Sonic Screwdriver does not work on anything made of wood and cannot kill, wound or maim living things.

Lock/Unlock Doors And Similar Objects: no roll is necessary, as success is automatic for most locks.

Control/Locate/Improve Machines: Dexterity + Science or Computer + 8, with a penalty depending on the complexity of the device.

Build/Repair/Damage Objects: Dexterity + Crafts + 8. Each roll represents a period of work determined by the ST. Each success restores/removes one point of Structure. Also add +8 to the Wyrd + Crafts roll for making Tokens.

Analyze Biological, Chemical And Physical Phenomena: Intelligence + Science + 8.

Negatives - Thought Sanchez was brutal in the first half, that pass to Westy ended his game, gave away the ball so many times (thought he was very decent sitting in front of the back 4 in the second half). Getting a bit bored of Clev, he really needs to actually 'Do Something' on the pitch to prove he is the player he thinks he is.

I've been involved in online dating for a long time, and can currently be found on OkC, POF and Tinder. /r/OkCupid has been very helpful since discovering it, and I second /u/whistling_fawn 's recommendation of getting over there and getting involved- the experience and information there is invaluable.

What I would say is don't give up. The only reason to give up is if you have what you consider a better method to try instead, or if you get to a position where you don't need to try any more. Otherwise you're just going from doing something about it to doing nothing about it at all, and that's a silly thing to do.

If you're less familiar with OkC (you don't specify which sites you use), they have been doing a lot of analysis of their own data over time on all kinds of things, including race and gender, and drawing conclusions from that, particularly in relation to message responses.

Negotiations on a new gilt-edged contract with Spurs is postponed until summer at the request of Eriksen camp. Tottenham are ready to reward Christian Eriksen for his impressive first year and a half in the Premier League club. But the Dane has not busy.

As BT could reveal as early as November, Tottenham sign a contract offer up that can make Eriksen to the best-paid Danish player. Eriksen serve in his current contract about 18 million. kr., but may rise up to 30 million. kr. annually if he accepts Tottenham's offer.

There were intentions from the London club's management to get it in place as early as December or January, but now, after an initial dialogue with Eriksen's agent, Martin Schoots, deferred negotiations.

It will therefore only after the season is over get together to discuss the terms of a contract extension, which is primarily to lift Christian Eriksen in salary compared to his increasing value for the club and the transfer market.

Tottenham boss Daniel Levy is very careful to reward its players for strong performance with new contracts, so he can reverse also sell them more expensive when the big clubs knocking on the door.

According to the Evening Standard want Eriksen camp not to focus on contract negotiations, there can be a disruptive element in the middle of an important season in which Eriksen even struggling to maintain a continuously high level.

Although Eriksen not managed to score in Saturday's 0-0 game against Crystal Palace, he has scored five goals in the Premier League this season.

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pocchettino spoke last week about Christian Eriksen's role in Tottenham in the longer term. He did so, among other things, because PSG coach Laurent Blanc in a chat with L'Equipe had called Eriksen a desire to play.

It's *possible* once under Holyrood control our end of the Estate stops generate any profit at-all but equally so profit could increase.

Lastly, we're talking about relatively small sums of money. I'm not sure where the £14m came from because that's 6% of total CEC profits, in 10/11 Scotland contributed only 2% of CEC profits. Either way, it's not New Scottish Utopia^^^TM building money.

P.S. I'd contest some of what you've said. Bentaleb is generally pretty sound on the ball. Kane can make poor decisions also, but the difference is he does so with a directness which often causes problems. Mason I can't really argue, his passing can be wasteful.

false,LordAnubis12,eng-sussex,Brighton,"Duel income and no kids I think is the biggest factor that is really a requirement for affordability nowadays, unfortunately. 

Rent for £530 - is that between you or individually? I agree with you regarding the victim card, but equally there is merit to it in some cases. I can't really complain as I move to Brighton knowing the costs involved, and thus forgoing the buying a house somewhat because I wanted to improve job chances and lifestyle. 

We're in a similar situation - DINK - pay about £800 in rent with bills on top of that, so probably about 1000 all in between us. 

I only work part time, so it's fairly reasonable to assume my income will double in the next year if I do get a new job, so I'll probably start saving 90% of excess that I'm then earning (already spend most of my monthly disposable on going out because it's such a tiny amount to save vs value of happiness). 

The issue really is getting into the position of having a mortgage in the first place. Once you're in that position I think, as you point out, it's fairly reasonable to start paying off chunks of cash, but for us getting to that initial point is a long long way off if we did want to buy in Brighton because house prices are rising so quickly and earnings do not keep up. 

Lets say we move outside of Brighton and then commute in for jobs, you're still looking at about 200k for a decent 2 bed flat/house right now. House prices in the SE/brighton area are going up 14% a year, so in 4 years time that'll be about 280,000.

Even if I was earning double what I do now, if deposits are what, 10-15% for a house? So 20k seems fairly reasonable, and if I was putting away like 6-700 a month, then that would take within the 3 years, which seems reasonable but wouldn't leave me with money for anything else really. Trying to save up with the increasing price then means an extra year to save, which then means they've gone up more, etc. So you're essentially banking on having a big pay rise to catch up. 


I realise these are back of cigarette workings out, but it just doesn't seem that realistic currently. I know we could move somewhere cheaper, but a) our friends are here and we've got a good life so we don't really want to, and even if we did sacrifice this b) jobs - not sure where we could go that would have the same sector and be cheaper than here.

And that's the issue really - just need more houses to keep house prices within sights for a bit. 

As I say, I'm  not really complaining because I moved here , but considering my parents bought a house when they were 20 on a single income, it does all seem a bit bloody crazy. ",0,1417985936,null,0,false,0,cmo3d5u,t3_2ojmcs,t1_cmo3d5u,t1_cmo258g,null,1425554278,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Learning to sketch graphs is a really valuable skill. When you're good at it will be way quicker than messing around with a graphical calculator.

That said, it's your decision. The most common choice is the Casio fx-9xx0 range. These are a bit shit - they've been selling them for a decade now, and it shows. If you can afford it, a TI N-Spire of some sort is the best you can get. However, you need to make sure you don't get the CAS version (these will do symbolic integration, which isn't allowed), and make sure it has an exam mode (this will clear the memory banks).

A simplified overview: generally if you are considered a UK resident for tax purposes you are liable to income tax on UK and overseas income, whereas a non-UK resident is liable to income tax only on UK income.

Or maybe your unquestioning view of a handed down simplified view of feminism is what's grade A bullshit.

&gt;Social stereotypes do not emerge out of thin air; they represent
an amalgam of nature and nurture, culture and psyche, time and
eternity. The way in which masculinity is socially reproduced is
of course a product of ideology, but this ideology has archetypal
foundations that are ignored at our peril 
(Tacey 1997:194).4



&gt;In this view, archetypal theory is not used to rationalise conservative theories of
immutable gender difference, but to provide an understanding of the cultural
depth of gender oppression which is not contained in the radicalism of socialconstructivist
theories (Tacey 1997)

We've always been taking larger progressive leaps forwards and smaller steps backwards away from liberalisation in this area. This is just one of those small steps, and does nothing in particular to stem the tide of progress.

Any knee-jerk reactions that don't first consider what it means in the first place are counter-productive and are not arguments that will sway any minds. The BBFC could even be pressured to change the rules again (and it's often a reflection of the public opinion that leads to guidelines in the first place).

But the argument ""You only did this because the Christian right told you to please change it back because it gets even worse."" is not a compelling argument to the BBFC, the government, or anyone else. The only people it ""convinces"" are those who are always convinced that this is the case, it's basically just a circlejerk in it's truest definition.

Guess what.

A woman in battle dress would look almost identical to a man in the same kit until you got pretty damn close, and even then you'd have to be almost standing on top of them to be able to tell the difference under the uniform, body armour, kit and helmet.

&gt; Our workers are increasingly less productive than our competitors even though we work longer hours. We have higher levels of personal debt, we have higher levels of public debt than almost all other western countries. We have a massive crisis with the pensioners and baby boomers retiring and placing a humongous strain on the welfare state during an age of austerity and public spending cuts, the cuts have not even begun really. The Tories planned to make most of their austerity budget cuts AFTER the next election. We already have a huge deficit and even bigger national debt, within a couple of years the debt interest payments on the national debt will reach £70-80 billion per year! that is almost as much as the entire defence and education budget and will be added to the deficit.

&gt; The State pension currently costs around £100 billion per year, by far one of the single biggest bills in the budget, 2nd only to the NHS at around £113 billion per year. With all these oldies retiring, by 2040 that state pension bill will be £237 billion per year! and the NHS will be not far off it. With out a massive increase in taxpayers to fund the welfare state and fund the massive numbers of retirees whom outnumber the taxpayers, we're going to see a huge changes to this country.

&gt; So short term? yeah having a ""booming"" housing market in London and the south is pushing GDP into positive territory, but it cannot last, they are always cyclical and that is all we have going for us at the moment.

Well, the answer is: just fine, because this country's wealth is not contingent upon an amoral, deluded few who think they can hold the nation to ransom. 

What actually happened was that from 2007-8, this lot begged for bailouts, were rescued and then tried to hide the extent of their fuck-ups by blaming Labour for their incompetence. 

The banks fucked up and then claimed it was Labour. 

This country's wealth is generated by its institutions: its nationalised education and healthcare, legal system, transport infrastructure and so on. It's not cokeheads in the city or CEOs with an overinflated sense of importance. 

If these leeches leave, [(and oh, how some of us only wish they would)](http://www.wewilldrivethemtotheairport.co.uk/), the country would be fine and we'd actually have a chance at rebalancing away from an overreliance on financial services that has hamstrung us for too long now.

What I am proposing is actually what basically everyone agreed was necessary post-2008, Osborne included. 

We can't afford to keep bailing out the financial sector. If you don't understand why, read what Andrew Haldane has to say about the Doom Loop. 

It's actually present austerity that's entirely ideological. You don't grow through cuts, that's why the recent growth came when the cuts slowed (the same reason why deficit reduction has ground to a halt). 

You don't reduce the deficit through cutting either, because it backfires when spending falls as do tax receipts with it (you should know this though, since you claim to know your economics). 

You reduce the deficit through growth because that's what increases GDP and reduces the need for the state organically (if people are wealthier and there are jobs everywhere you look, surprise, surprise, you don't need the state to spend for you).

I really hope they visit other worlds and planets on a epic search to find gallifrey, it was saved so long ago that some evidence of them trying to reach the main universe must be around. this was alluded to with 12s chalkboard nonsense.

Sturridge would have pulled those CBs away with a run forcing the DM to chase Gerrard and giving Sterling a clear path to turn on the burners and find anyone really at that point.

false,TopdeBotton,null,null,"Yeah, if the government did rebalance away from financial services, it would lose taxation revenues from that sector. But then, that's the very point. (Those revenues would then be made up from other industries (that are less likely to fail and require massive state bailouts.)

The 2007-8 financial crisis showed the basic problem with having a large financial sector. If it fails, and it makes up a large proportion of the Exchequer's revenues, the country's fucked, because then the state has to assume a massive load of bad debt, because the state is fundamentally responsible for the basic functioning of the banking system. 

That's the basic reasoning behind rebalancing away from an excessively large financial services industry. If that sector is smaller than it was before, and it fails again, then it costs the country less in future, and future public finances won't be compromised as much. 

Now, what I would propose, would be to expect the banking sector to contribute to its bailing out and to bearing the appropriate brunt of austerity. Because that's how capitalism is supposed to work. The state isn't meant to have to bail out private banks because they are meant to know what they are doing. What's wrong with private banks and financial institutions being expected not to fail constantly and to pay for their mistakes themselves? 

The rest of the country shouldn't have to risk losing the NHS, or legal aid, or welfare because it had to bail out the financial services sector. 

Comparisons with Greece are unhelpful because the UK isn't part of the EMU. The UK is in control of its economic policy. UK debt is also very highly regarded; short and long term interest rates are actually very low in this country (lower than they have been for a long time!) because the world does not lose sleep over the UK's ability to repay its government debt! 

Prior to the financial crash, UK government debt and the deficit were manageable. It's the banking sector failing which changed things. You're getting symptom and cause mixed up. 

If (i) we reduce the size of the banking sector (manageably, over sufficient time), (ii) get it to pay for its mistakes and (iii) support a sustainable recovery, let's say, through increasing government spending on green technologies (which provide jobs for people and research and investment for companies), then austerity isn't as necessary. 

Basically, if we can get the financial services sector to stop fucking up, reduce its ability to fuck up, and get the state to do what it's supposed to do (spend on basic research in new industries), then we'll be OK.

Not that I like it, but anyone in their position would be forced to do the same.

false,jy_am,CA,canada,"MLS, NBA, and NHL all have salary caps, so it matters less to have an owner who will spend in the club. The biggest problem with having MLSE as an owner is that they want to have the power to sign off on front office hiring and player personnel moves. They can't just hire a president of basketball operations, for example, and just let them run the team without interfering.

However, having an owner like Roman Abramovich would probably be similar to what the Mavericks get from having an owner like Mark Cuban. Even if he can't spend more than the salary cap on payroll, he can invest in the club in other ways, *e.g.*, spending on statistical analysis, scouting, better facilities.

EDIT: I should add that this is only a useful move if the new owner changes the way MLSE operates.

The SNP have a bad habit of getting into bed with private businesses without much thought. Trumpt, Murdoch, and Prestwick airport being examples. I will admit this and wish political opponents would call them up on it more often, because I agree it is a problem.

Also Salmond is a politician in every way. He chases the spotlight, he derides and bashes opponents and , in short, he plays the dirty game without hesitation. In FMQs he largely ignores the question, laughs at his opponents and takes every opportunity to shift the blame on Wesminster.

With that out of the way, he's also the best politician Scotland can hope for, and most likely the best one in Britain at the moment. 

He has devoted himself to a minor party for most of his life, he has fought Scotland's corner with dedication while FM, he has donated his extra salaries, he has outright bashed newspapers like the Telegraph and the Daily Mail, banning them  from his resignation speech and making fun of their reporters, and he has resigned with dignity when he lost the election.

He is a politician and he is arrogant. But he actually has principles and they have cost him, and in my opinion he's been good for Scottish politics and Scotland.

This will probably not change your mind if you are fully convinced, but I actually think that it is an unfortunate coincidence based on all the facts and interviews with the relevant people.

The plate was not changed from the original plate at manufacture. The car was sold new with those plates. This is not open to debate. You can look out up yourself and prove it since all British cars have their history tracked from their first sale.

You could suggest that they chose that car for the plates, but they wanted a specific car and there were only two of those cars available for sale as they are so rare. The one they bought was the best quality of the two.

Furthermore, the people involved are no strangers to controversy. Just Google ""top gear controversy"" and you'll see. One thing they have never done though is lie about their controversy and pretend it didn't happen. They have *always* owned up and apologised for their insults and jokes when they took them too far.

They are owned by a sensitive publicly funded company and are forced to by the higher ups. The company would never risk lying in public about this kind of thing. If top gear did this as a tasteless joke, their bosses would certainly have forced them to apologise after all this fuss. 

But at the end of the day, you've probably made up your mind and no amount of ""proof"" and statistics will convince you otherwise.

We are having falls in unemployment and falls in average wages. That means that the jobs that are being created are low wage, low-skilled jobs. Any kind of moralising about this fact is complex and cannot be distilled into a single sentence, not least something as primitive like real-wage falls, which is a statistic which is not felt by everyone in a consistent way.

Skilled workers are having difficulty getting into jobs where they can apply their skills, but they can get some menial work in retail or in a warehouse for around minimum wage. Therefore, falling wages and unemployment is an improvement that prevents destitution, but it is not a solution that enables prosperity.

The sheer number of able-bodied people flowing at the bottom rung of the economy makes the value of labour only barely worth minimum wage. Most work and even a lot of skills that would be sought after in the 80's just isn't considered valuable any more by virtue of overwhelming supply.

Question is, what can we do about it? The current policy in the western world has been economic growth, which means increasing the demand for work by any means, but that just doesn't seem enough.

The future of politics is accepting that there are limits on how much you can increase demand and working out how you can reduce the supply. The right suggests more harshly controlling immigration, the left suggests having people spend less hours in the week working and more hours being subsidised by the state.

&gt;Skateboarding

Plenty places to skate in Edinburgh, but not great if you're using the board to get from A to B (hills, cobbles etc.)

&gt;D&amp;D and RPGs

I know there are university societies dedicated to this sort of thing, and I'm sure there is a game shop near the campus

&gt;Hiking/camping etc.

Edinburgh will def. be the better option of the two for this. Not to far from the Pentlands (hills just south of Edi), or you can travel further north and get some good mountains in the Cairgorms, Glencoe or the Nevis range (or the Cuillins in Skye, my personal fav)

&gt;smoke a good amount of pot

When I was at uni here I never had too much trouble finding pot. I know you can get it from about £10/gram

&gt;safety

generally a fairly safe place, especially the areas around the uni. You will be unlikely to find trouble anywhere that you will be living/studying

&gt;housing for international students

Uni accommodation that I have experienced has never been too bad, and almost always within 20 minutes or less walking distance of campus

&gt;how big is your campus

Big enough that you won't get bored of it, small enough that you'll find your way around easy enough and run into people that you know.

&gt;venture to other parts of the UK

easy enough to get to a good amount of the UK using the trains - including a service that goes to London in only a few hours.

&gt;or the continent

It will be easier to get to the continent from London, especially if you plan on driving (channel tunnel or ferry from Dover) but there is still airports in Edinburgh and Glasgow that'll take you where you want to go

Hope this helps, feel free to ask follow up questions. I'm sure you'd be happy with either place to be honest.

If the young people, stay away from London, would this mean stronger, more influential outer cities in a few decades time? Or will they drift back into London in their late 40s/early 50s once the kids move out?

If they don't move back to London, we have a gap in employment/ culture/ manpower/ influence, and the average age rises. Before long even the super rich have retired, and are replaced only with those who are happy to move to London. Which if you have a family, house, schools already settled without the higher overheads, that's potentially quite a big ask. The culture won't be there, or won't be as strong, so the draw of the lifestyle may be less influential.

If they do move back once they're older, they'll be out of the housing market, won't be on the same career ladders than if they'd stayed, and commuting further distances, or more flexible working hours may be needed. Which will likely have to happen as more of business is done online anyway.

Either way, whatever balance there is now will shift. Those who stay will be of a different background to those who chose to leave. Business centres will be able to build up outside London, as the draw of a single financial/ business/ cultural centre becomes dispersed.

Interesting anyway.

I haven't fact checked this data yet; but if true we are either really ambitious or simply idiotic. I fall into the cynical corner on this one.

On the issue of credibility I'm not sure what the latest opinion polls are but by conversations I have with people on a day to day basis they don't have much if any confidence in the NI assembly.

Also I'm not sure how much of a priority the economy is to most people; as more people seem to rally against cultural issues than social and economic issues. 

Also when the ROI economy was going through it's celtic tiger period I never heard one unionist say they wished to join the republic due to it's more prosperous economy. I personally believe no matter how strong either the ROI/British economy is performing people put their cultural/national identity first.

Personally I feel that a United Ireland has several benefits which would supersede the drawbacks. First of all a UI would mean greater decentralisation of power; meaning the people of NI would have more say in the political, social and economic issues that effect them. What's the point in being part of the UK if you have no influence in investment etc, seems like a rather pointless membership to me. Currently NI MPs account for only 18 out of 650. Where as part of a UI, NI MP's would have a share of around 25% - 33% of the Dáil. 

My biggest fear as part of the ROI would be not having a National Health Service as I feel it's a human right to have free health care available to all of it's citizens; and find the thought of having a profit motive health care system disgusting. 
 
Also in some sectors; workers in the ROI take home up to 60% more pay! If you want to know more about this I would recommend reading/listening to some of Dr. David McCann's blogs/interviews/podcasts. He's a lot more qualified to answer your questions than me :)

Jay Rodriguez is not the answer to that.

As for the CB - Raul Albiol isn't the answer either. He's a positional defender, we have enough of those.

Have we ever bought 3 players in January? Has anyone? 

We *might* buy one player. And if that's the case, i wouldn't buy for a position we are already strong in. That means no CBs, no CMs and no wingers. Putting aside all the apocalyptic bullshit about our squad, we have too many players already. There are too many who havent been given a fair shake as it is. Stambouli is definitely one to my mind. 

Christ, I don't even know what to say to some of you. Not even halfway through the season and some of you want to change the squad again? You may as well sack the manager while you're at it. I know its tough to be a fan sometimes when the team isn't performing, but buying three new players is not the answer.

An academic degree proves you have brains, that you can analyse information, work independently, work hard etc. the list is endless.

So what interests you? What are your passions? What would you look forward to doing when you get up in the morning? What would you still love to do when you're getting older?

Answer these questions, then think, 'so, what's the first step?  What do I need to do now to fulfil my goals?'

Hope this helps. Sorry if it sounds corny. Back in the day I got a history degree and had exactly the same kind of choices to make. Wish we'd had reddit back then.

The other providers (like the other comment says) are MVNOs who'll be using the network of one of the above. 3mobile also provide free 4G so worth checking them out too.

Very much the same with the banks too, all current accounts are free, and charges for overdrafts etc are all pretty similar, so I guess find one with a branch near where you're living - if you go to maps.google.com and search for 'bank' at the nearest town it'll show you the ones that have branches in that town.

&gt; Topically applied niacinamide has been shown to increase ceramide and free fatty acid levels in skin, prevent skin from losing water content, and stimulate microcirculation in the dermis.

Henderson refused to be sold for peanuts to Fulham, and then had to wait until nearly all the midfielders were injured to start a game, and Rodgers got BTFO so hard he had to drop an favored and ever-starting yet completely shit-at-the-time Allen.

Borini is meanwhile rotting at home, optimistically waiting for Rodgers to tell him ""OK, you're in."" Fuck it, maybe he's getting paid better here than what he would have gotten paid in Sunderland. He's got world class training to keep him fit and practice as well, I suppose.

false,xelah1,null,null,"&gt; I've always said, if a billionaire is $101 million richer since last year, and the bottom million people are £100 worse off, well, factually, we're better off as a nation.

There are similar niggling problems with this real-wage data.

Move someone from unemployed to a low wage and the average wage falls. Have an immigrant accept a below-average job here whilst increasing his income and not affecting anyone else, the average wage falls.

Or, be a country (Italy or Spain, say) with relatively protected, older, better paid workers and a huge youth unemployment rate and your average wage will look better.

It's a very tricky number to draw conclusions from.

But you're quite right that GDP is, too - GDP measures exactly what it measures, the value of production within some geographical area, it's not the 'how well does our economy do its job' index people sometimes treat it as.

&gt; Can you imagine the difference in the world if over a third of all the world's money wasn't stashed in tax havens for fear it might actually do some good for the majority of people?

Well, what would happen? And why do you think so?

If you literally take a bunch of money and stash it in a box in a tax haven then that money has effectively left circulation. A central bank can print more to replace it with no fear of inflation. You need a more thorough theory than 'ur, well our bank account would be bigger' when you're talking at a whole-economy level.
