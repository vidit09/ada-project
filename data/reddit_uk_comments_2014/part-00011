Disney has been ""in form"" for much longer than a year or two, especially when you start including their direct to DVD releases.

&gt;**The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot** is a 2013 comedy spoof and homage to the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who. It debuted on the BBC Red Button service after the broadcast of ""The Day of the Doctor"", the official 50th anniversary special. The programme was written and directed by Peter Davison, who stars alongside fellow former Doctor actors Sylvester McCoy, Colin Baker and Paul McGann. It includes cameos from another former Doctor David Tennant, the incumbent Doctor Matt Smith, the current companion Jenna Coleman, the former companion John Barrowman, Doctor Who executive producer Steven Moffat, former producer Russell T Davies, and numerous others connected to the programme, many parodying themselves.

true,Galerath,null,null,"&gt;He got lucky because he was able to use easy credit to start off and expand his portfolio - I'd love to see him try now!

It's much easier to get a Buy to Let mortgage than a regular one these days. The issue is getting the deposit down. 

As for this bit:

&gt;He doesn't realise or simply doesn't care that he, and people like him, are responsible for the large rises in rental costs by constricting demand.

By to Let Landlords are creating supply not constricting demand. The major issues in the property market are as follows:

1. Houses are too expensive compared to wages. 

2. Credit is difficult to come by (and if it wasn't people would be over-leveraging their position due to point 1.)

3. There aren't enough houses (restricted supply).

These factors mean that a lot of people who would have traditionally bought a home, such as young professionals, are forced to keep renting. So there's a lack of property and soaring rental demand, forcing rental prices upwards. 

Now you *could* claim that prices are artificially inflated by portfolio landlords, but that's putting the cart before the horse - people went into property *because* property prices were soaring, making it an obvious choice to invest. It probably exacerbated the problem, but I think single home owners are just as much to blame at present. With the falling wages in real terms, house prices should be falling aswell but people aren't selling up because they're mortgaged up to the hilt on property that is no longer worth as much as it used to be, so they obviously don't want to sell, further restricting supply. This of course returns us to the major problem - missold credit. The idea of giving a 95%+ mortgage is just stupid, because it puts the risk onto the banks and encourages people to stretch themselves for a home, pushing prices up and creating this resistance to lowering prices.

*That this House welcomes the positive contribution made to the health of the nation by the NHS homeopathic hospitals; notes that some six million people use complementary treatments each year; believes that complementary medicine has the potential to offer clinically-effective and cost-effective solutions to common health problems faced by NHS patients, including chronic difficult to treat conditions such as musculoskeletal and other chronic pain, eczema, depression, anxiety and insomnia, allergy, chronic fatigue and irritable bowel syndrome; expresses concern that NHS cuts are threatening the future of these hospitals; and calls on the Government actively to support these valuable national assets.*

And sent this reply to a constituent who wrote to him saying homoeopathy doesn't work  :

*Dear Mr Ellis,
Thank you very much for your letter regarding EDM 1240 in support of Homeopathic Hospitals. I appreciate that you are disappointed that I added my name to this motion, and read your comments on this issue with interest.
I understand that it is your view that homeopathy is not effective, and therefore that people should not be encouraged to use it as a treatment. However I am afraid that I have to disagree with you on this issue. Homeopathic care is enormously valued by thousands of people and in an NHS that the Government repeatedly tells us is ""patient-led"" it ought to be available where a doctor and patient believe that a homeopathic treatment may be of benefit to the patient.
I am grateful to you for taking the time to write with your concerns. I realise that my answer will be a disappointing one for you, but I hope that the letter helps to clarify my view.
Yours sincerely,
(Signed)

Question: The vast majority of able-bodied adults are able to drive and have access to a car. I wonder if the same is true for disabled people? If it's not, then perhaps the ""minority"" isn't so small.

The issue at hand here is that the company has decided that a larger vehicle is charged out at a higher rate than a normal car, regardless of how many passengers it's carrying. Makes sense - after all, they cost more to run.

**However**, a single person in a wheelchair may need a larger vehicle. They cannot take advantage of the lower fare offered to individuals in a normal car.

Whilst pus filled it is 99% of the time dead white blood cells, there is no bacterial infection.

In America the treatment can for the more persistent offenders include drilling a drainage hole with a CO2 laser; this way it can't close up and the normal function of the infected sweat gland can resume without the immune system picking a fight with it, if it does pick a fight then drainage is taken care of; no more large painful swellings exploding.

That's why the NHS will spend a million pounds on complex surgeries and treatments for a sick 10 year old, but it won't give pay for much less expensive drugs to extend a 95-year old's life by the same amount of time - the old person will probably spend their extra time in bed whereas the 10 year old might be able to gain new life experiences and play with their family and friends.

Slightly counterintuitively this increase is  best explained NOT because of 
massive rise in the needs of young women but because most young people now have mobile phones - instead of a single household one - which means they can now phone or text with much more privacy.

true,Lolworth,cnty-expat,💂 London,"As someone running a public service, you have a duty to treat disabled customers as much 'the same' as possible. This is enshrined in law.

Although this might not make sense from a a vehicular point of view, the most sensible way forward would be as follows:

Able bodied individual calls? Send a 4 seater, charge for a 4 seater  
Group of able bodied individuals call? Send a minibus, charge for a minibus  
Disabled individual calls? Send a minibus, charge as an individual (i.e. four seater)

This isn't 'political correctness gone mad'. It's allowing people with disabilities to live a normal life free of difficulty and extra charges.

Run a taxi firm and worry you'll have to do this all the time? Don't worry, you won't. By definition, disabled people are a *minority* - there aren't very many of them, hence you won't receive many requests. The vast amount of disabled people will have their own travel arrangements (believe me, they're used to it) and every so often you'll have to charge someone a small car price for a large car. I'm sure the difference in terms of employee wages and petrol will be negligible.

However I do agree with your final point. In one of my other posts I pointed out that the Standard Hackney Rate for Middlesbrough makes no distinction between cars and multiseaters, Boro Taxis are charging multiseater rates at their own discretion. They should just follow suit and charge multiseater rates only when there are in excess of 4 passengers like everyone else does.

This entire situation could have been avoided if they had simply done this. Instead, Bashir (who sounds like an utter drip to me), is going round making passive agressive statements and being a bit of a dick. 

His statement that he cannot economically run his company by charging single wheelchair passengers (or those with less than 3 others) is a load of old crap. 

I drive a wheelchair vehicle for a company which specializes in wheelchair transport - it has contracts with the local hospitals, schools, the council, residential homes etc. All the wheelchair vehicles belong to the company and the drivers operate them on a 50/50 basis - the company's revenue is directly dictated by what the drivers charge the passengers. And we manage just fine by charging Tariff 1 to everybody. We don't even charge Tariff 2 when there are more than 4 people - we just put a 20p charge for every passenger in excess of one.

Each company is different, but we have an expensive fleet insurance policy and a fleet of our own vehicles as well as waged controllers.

Unfortunately for you the closest Cat B match to the Liverpool game is Aston Villa on the 12th April.

Selhurst Park is small for a Premier League side so whilst we're up here it is sold out pretty much every week, and this system aims to give preference to Palace fans who come regularly rather than (no disrespect meant, and maybe you are a big Palace fan!) neutrals or occasional fans who want to see Palace take on the top Premier League teams.

If you just wanted to see a football match you may have more luck getting a one off ticket at one of the larger grounds (Emirates, Stamford Bridge, White Hart Lane etc) although I have no idea how the ticketing works there.

If you can earn that sort of prestige, then in the long run top players will be throwing themselves at your club. 

My point is that even in the chance that Shaw is the next Ashley Cole or Dani Alves, City strategically will want to make sure that our rivals don't get him even if we run the chance of him being a flop in the future.

I just think it is incredibly difficult to write a good strong woman.

Also I Rivers character might be a ""strong"" woman, but she isn't indepenend at all, her whole being revolves around the Doctor.
She was born part Timelord because of the Doctor (indirect), she was abducted and trained as an Assassin because of the Doctor, she drops her lifelong goal of killing him because of the Doctor, she becomes an archeologist because of the Doctor, she goes to jail because of the Doctor, she let's the universe end at one point because of the Doctor, it's always because of the Doctor with her!

There're many strong woman I really like, for example: Olivia Armstrong (FMA:B), Maka (Soul Hunter), Samus Aran (Metroid), Chell and Glados (Portal), almost the entire cast of MLP:FiM (which has only 1 regular male character), Kim Possible and Shego (Kim Possible), Princess Bubblegum + Marceline + Fiona + Flame Princess (Adventure Time), Toph Beifong + Katara + Suki + Azula + Korra + Koyshi (Avatar), Sam Carter (Stargate SG-1), Mikasa (Attack on Titan), Seras (Hellsing), Hungary (Hetalia).

Sure you could debate how ""strong"" some of these examples are, and they're not all by a long shot, I could go on and on and on and on. Personal Character Interpretation plays a huge role.

For me River Song was never really a strong character or independend or even interesting. She was arrogant, had a long list of sue-traits, and her actress didn't do a good job with many of her scences feeling pretty forced. Nothing against the actress though since I doubt someone else could've done better, it's the character that is the problem.

Just to name a few of the sue-traits **I** see in her, just so nobody says ""You always claim that but never provide examples"":

- She knows the future of the Doctor
- She often takes the lead, degrading the Doctor to a companion of hers, at least in her early apperances
- Her entire life revolves around the Doctor
- She has her own timetravel device
- She has her own Sonic Screwdriver (which of course the Doctor gave her) and at one point the same gun as Captain Jack.
- She's in a prison but can go and leave as she pleases
- She's ""incredible beautiful"" so that she can seduce people like prison guards
- She can fly the Tardis better than the Doctor
- She knows the Doctors name
- She is allowed to have a gun and make use of it despite the Doctor hating weapons and rarely picks up one himself
- She teases others about her knowledge but then handwaves it with ""spoilers""
- She's the child, from the future, of the current companions, who was trained as a deadly assassin to kill the Doctor but then fell in love with him and *marries* him
- She's part Timelord for one of the most nonsense reasons I've ever heard, I'm not a lore master for Who, but I still doubt Timelords can be created like that.
- Almost all of her dialioque with the Doctor bis flirting

Urgh I could go on and on, but seriously, she's a huge sue in my opinion. She's on the same level as the most shameless self-insert OCs I've ever seen.

So really, get away with these silly accusations. I like good written characters, female or male, I don't care.

true,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"&gt; No, No, No. I cannot disagree more. Openreach supply FTTN/FTTC, basically fiber to the green box on the street. From there, it's copper cable to the house, which is massively lossy as it tends to use the existing infrastructure.

That's over-egging it a bit. Openreach does supply full fibre to the premises in some areas - part of my village has it (not mine, sadly) and I've driven through quite a few places locally where you can spot the tell-tale ""bug"" on the poles which is where the fibre from the house connects to (and therefore the absence of any FTTC cabinet).

It's not ""massively lossy"", although it is still heavily distance dependent. I'm about 400 metres away from my cabinet and I can still connect at close to 80Mbit down, and the full 20Mbit up.

In any case, this is completely irrelevant to the comment you replied to, or the OP. They are discussing whether BT/Openreach will let a third party rent or install their own fibre cable into the OP's building, so that the third party can supply their own service, totally and completely unrelated to Openreach's FTTC or FTTP network. The only similarity is that they will be separate fibres in the same duct, but going to different places.

&gt; A shared connection like this is also subject to MULJS - Multi User Latency/Jitter syndrome. Basically, when a number of people are using the connection, the node drops packets that it deems ""less important"" (have a google about packet headers - interesting stuff) ruining the experience for gamers, downloaders, video conferencers etc.

Are you still talking about Openreach GEA here? I'm not sure that this happens - in FTTC you have a dedicated line to the cabinet, and the cabinet itself has a significant amount of backhaul (at least 1Gbit, maybe 10Gbit) to the headend. It would take a lot of users to get close to maxing that out. FTTP is shared but the scale is different (gigabits of capacity split between a low number of users).

I don't think BT/Openreach takes any notice of QoS headers in either direction, as otherwise everyone would mark their traffic as high priority. I understand the only time it makes any difference is when using BT's IPTV service. The ISPs themselves may choose to apply and adhere to any QoS headers set, but the Openreach network doesn't care. At least on the mass market consumer connections, this is more than likely to be true - possibly the higher-end stuff will be different.

If anything, the Virgin service you are a fan of would experience this ""syndrome"" since it's not a lot of capacity shared by hundreds of users, many of which will have packages that allow them to download at maybe 1/3rd of the total capacity (so only a few users have to be downloading for demand to exceed capacity and therefore any measures Virgin have to mitigate this will take effect).

I've never heard of MULJS as some kind of recognised acronym or syndrome, do you have a source? I am welcome to be corrected.

&gt; Now, what you want to do is talk to the likes of Virgin Media, who supply fibre right up to your junction box. They are usually willing to do a line rental plan, which most of the time works out at around the same price most other competitors (between 6 and 10 pounds a month). If you don't have Virgin media cabled in yet, they usually offer to have it installed for a fee. Spread amongst your 30 block residents, that fee is going to be fairly affordable.

Virgin's cable network (if you're talking about this and not some sort of leased line) is only fibre to a node somewhere in the local area, which isn't necessarily close to your house (it doesn't matter since it can be amplified, unlike VDSL as used by BT). It's still copper co-ax between your house and that node.

You talk about congestion and shared capacity above as if it's a bad thing, but then you appear to recommend the very service that suffers from congestion the most. 

Are Virgin actually extending their network now? My understanding is that they won't listen to you unless you are very close to where their existing network ends and then only if it can be done with minimal cost or effort. Besides, OP is mentioning Hyperoptic because it's cheap and fast (gigabit I believe).

That's an interesting point.

To what extend SHOULD clinicians look at non-clinical issues when deciding whether or not to fund treatments?

The canonical example would be the super expensive cancer drug that whilst not curing your cancer, will retard it's growth enough to give you anything between 3 and 9 extra months of life at a horrific cost to the tax payer (you wouldn't believe how much this sort of stuff can cost).

It can be argued that such a drug has little clinical benefit as the patient is only going to succumb to the cancer anyway, but the intangible benefits of giving a 38yr old with two kids an extra 6 months with their family... well that's going to be harder to argue against.

This is very unpleasant BUT they are rightfully making the call that the money could be spent elsewhere saving lives rather than extending lives. 

Yanks, and and others can slag this off or sensationalise it as being a death panel but in reality it's life. You have to draw a line somewhere.

    1. giving the wrong idea or impression

Homeserve are selling an insurance product designed to protect specific components of a residential home dwelling. They have assigned a value to this product and divided this value into two components:

 1) First year costs segmented into attractive, surprisingly low monthly amounts

 2) Second and subsequent year costs which are realistic to ensure the product creates a profit

The first component is heavily promoted as the headline of the literature and designed such that it stands out as the cost of the product (which it clearly is not!).

The second component is neatly hidden away, and recipients of the literature are therefore coerced into purchasing the product by virtue of the attractiveness of the (seemingly) very low monthly costs which are clearly advertised on the first page.

This is the very nature of misleading: the fact that the true costs are 
hidden away on a **creates the wrong impression** and encourages consumption of the product **based on this incorrect idea** (that the product is very inexpensive).

I say this should not be allowed, however it is a pervasive mechanism used by almost all utility companies be it telecommunications, gas, water and so on. Companies like Homserve take advantage of clever marketing techniques like this that rely upon the fact that not everyone has had enough life experience to understand and truly appreciate that if something looks took good to be true, then **it is**.

Actually, NICE doesn't do that.

Yes we have debt at 80% of GDP. So fucking what, it was at 250% of GDP when we set up the NHS!

Government finance doesn't work like individual finance and only the disingenuous or the economically stupid claim that it does.

The main difference between now and the immediate post-war period is that the wealthy (and corporations) have run a massive PR campaign to absolve themselves of their responsibility to society as a whole. A truly short term view as it is easily shown that when the society as a whole does better then the economy does better including those at the top.

Like it or not, its simply realistic to concentrate the resources and efforts of medicine on those likely to benefit from it the most.

given the budget of 3 treatments, you are better of treating  3 children than 3 pensioners, as overall the net benefit is greater and it has a better impact on society.

This goes on in the NHS everyday and entire departments exist in order to calculate and  set the strategy for cost effective treatment options for conditions. age is just another vital and necessary factor in these calculations.

Edinburgh College of Art had some problems a couple years back in regards to foreign students. They were supposed to take an even ratio of Scottish to foreign students, but instead favoured foreign students by an overwhelming degree in order to get as much money out of them as possible.

I went to the Masters degree show last year and around 2/3rds of the students were from China.

He has put in several man of the match performances, including [yesterday against Sheffield United](http://platform-online.net/2014/01/notts-county-2-sheffield-united-1-man-of-the-match-jack-grealish/).


We are obviously struggling for creativity as our only attacking midfield options are Albrighton and Tonev. Neither have scored or assisted a single goal this season.

true,handyandy86,null,[CANADIAN BACON Scally],"The thing is, a 10% return over 5 years is actually pretty bad.  You can get on average a conservative 5% yearly return if you invest in index funds.  In fact on average in a well thought out index fund you should be earning around 7% annually. so yeah, 10% for a property investment over 5 years is actually quite shite.  I have read the general rule for successful property investment is only really worth it if you can get 1% of your purchase price every month.  If you are buying a single apartment this is pretty hard to achieve even in Liverpool's overstocked market.  

The 1% rule works like this.  if you buy a property for £100,000 you should expect 1% of that price for rent.  Some investors even try to aim for 2%.  The reason you need such a high return is the upkeep.  In rental properties things require repair and sometimes quite often, especially so in student accommodation. 

But then your probably thinking ""but handyandy, what about appreciation!"".  My response to that is if you can reliably predict this and the numbers make sense then by all means its a great investment.  Just keep in mind that inflation at an average 2% per year can eat into your investment and a depreciation with less than 1% return monthly is a losing battle...

**TL/DR: 9% over 5 years is a scam and a horrible investment unless you know that your property will appreciate significantly over those 5 years.

That's media briefing for fans to not get on their backs if nothing is done in January. I may be a bit cynical but I have a feeling we won't make any deals this window, perhaps a loan. I just think we won't be making a permanent move for anyone unless someone leaves us. 

What I have a problem against is say: we think Salah is worth £9m. Hypothetically, they want £18m and we end up paying £15m. BAD deal, that is 50% more than what we valued him at and that is the LFC transfers that I would like us to avoid repeating. But its being reported that they want £13m, if we then made a deal for £12m I'll be very happy. 

Just using that as a hypothetical, I agree with their policy of not over spending any more. For sure. But it feels as if BR is being harnessed and we have a good opportunity to break into the top 4 what with Spurs and Man U having ""poor"" seasons (whilst being very close to us in the league). They have better squads and next season, looking at it from a best case scenario, you have to say that ATLEAST one of them will be making a huge improvement. That's going to make it very tough for next season. 

It just seems as if they're hoping we get into the top 4 and then use CL money.

The biggest flaw with this argument is the assumption that free will exists and that the ""choices"" people make aren't based on factors beyond their control.  Which really is a debate in itself.

 [A quick google has given me this example](http://jech.bmj.com/content/39/2/169.full.pdf) (pdf):

&gt;Our finding was that the boys without a father and the girls without a mother were most likely to smoke suggests that these teenagers adopt smoking to cope with the strain of filing the role of the missing same-sex parent.

It's easy to criticize people who make choices that mean they are more of a burden on the NHS and other social services, but in my eyes, they never really had a choice.   And if we make the opposite assumption, that free will does not exist and hard determinism rules our lifes...to claim someone could have made any other choice than the one they have, is to suggest they can move between alternate universes in which they were not predisposed to making that choice.

Yes they are. An Astravan is a van. A Ford Escort van is a van. It doesn't have to be the size of a large transit to be classed as a van. The [Fiat Doblo](http://vans.autotrader.co.uk/used-vans/fiat/doblo) and [VW Caddy](https://www.volkswagen-vans.co.uk/range/caddy/) disabled vehicles are adapted from the van and minibus versions respectively.

The wheelchair adapted Fiat Doblo my mother has for my gran is exactly the same as the Fiat Doblo van my wife uses for work with the exception of rear side windows and a dropped floor.

You don't know what the fuck you're on about.

The latter film, which was narrated by actor Christian Slater, was shown at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, and was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize.

Furthermore, as the graph you display demonstrates, under austerity Britain's debt as a proportion of GDP has actually **gone up**.

So austerity, which was sold to us as the solution for our ""debt crisis"", has actually made it worse.

What the government should have done, instead of austerity, is a programme of infrastructure spending financed by quantitative easing. And while we're at it, use QE to fund the government's normal budget deficit. 

This will either cause inflation, or it won't. If it doesn't, what's the problem, keep doing it. If it does, it means the national debt is worth less in real terms.

I dont think it's so much that. Drugs is an interesting topic, you ha e to consider the vast range of impacts a change in drugs policy will have. It effects culture, economics, crime, international relationships not to mention the impact on several private sector industries.

The question of legalisation is too short sighted. It's not a question of if we should, it's a question of how we should.

true,buried_treasure,null,null,"UK football is also divided into leagues, although they work very differently to US baseball. For England and Wales you have four national leagues:

* Premier League
* Championship
* League One
* League Two

Below those are various ""feeder"" leagues which are regional rather than national. The players in the feeder leagues are as a rule part-timers rather than full-time professional footballers -- the small non-league clubs just don't have the money to employ players on a full-time basis.

There are 92 clubs in total that play in the national divisions (20 in Premier League, 24 in each of the others), and the Premier League teams are generally the ones that are internationally famous. As a rule, as you go down the leagues the clubs are smaller, less wealthy, tickets are cheaper, and the number of fans at games is less. But the teams in the lower leagues do have some very enthusiastic fans and if you get a good game the atmosphere can be terrific, although obviously a game with 6,000 watching is never going to match the atmosphere of a packed 50,000-seater stadium as in the Premier League.

Leeds's main team (and the only Leeds team in the four national divisions) is Leeds United who currently play in the Championship. If you're familiar with Elland Road then you know about them! To be honest you'd be perfectly fine taking her there, all clubs have distinct groups of fans including obviously noisy lairy lads like your workmates, but there will also be plenty of families who go along and clubs usually have specific areas of the stadium set aside for family tickets. If you want a more American sit-down-and-watch type experience, that's where you probably want to be.

All football clubs release tickets for registered fans first, and then usually a couple of weeks before the game any still-available tickets go on general sale. For particularly important matches, or ones where the two teams have a strong history of rivalry, there might not be any tickets on general sale. http://www.leedsunited.com/how-to-book has some good information about Leeds's ticketing arrangements.

Alternatively there are a number of non-league clubs in Leeds (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_Leeds) but you'll need to ask a local about which of those might be worth watching.

I'm not sure what you find intimidating either. The only difference you'll find is the size of the crowd, at least at most clubs.

As for where to sit, etc. that depends on the club but if I were you I'd try to get tickets in the parts of the ground that have the most expensive tickets. If there's a designated family stand it might be a quieter experience but in the eyes of most fans that's the opposite of what's enjoyable. I'd try to find some good local food on a site like urbanspoon or yelp, rather than eat at the ground. The food in the ground will be over priced and akin to burger van food.

Wherever you go, just wrap up warm. Where whatever you like, other than another teams shirt. No one will care what your wearing otherwise.

That's because (and I may be preaching to the converted here) bringing a new drug to market is horrifically fucking expensive and is never a sure thing.

Drug design is a tricky business and tens of millions will be spent on research compounds before a drug even gets to the stage of animal trials let alone testing on humans (which may not work) or seeing if it's viable to produce in bulk (it may not be) or even if sufficient profit can be turned to make it worthwhile bringing out (still no guarantee).

For every drug that comes to the market, there are hundreds of millions spent on every other compound that did NOT come to market for all the reasons above. It really is no joke when drug companies claim that it can cost upwards of one billion dollars to bring a new drug to market.

So, whenever someone says that drug companies are evil and only think of the money... well yes, of course they are going to think of the money as it's simply not viable for this sort of R&amp;D to be publicly funded.

Because he was a high ranking Tory MP who has admitted to being there to the police who want to arrest him but can`t because of the political shit storm that would follow. 

It is worth reading the articles relating to this one on exaronews as they have covered this extensively.
form the same site:

Update 11 January 2014: The Security Service, MI5, and Scotland Yard’s Special Branch are understood to be taking a close interest in the investigations by the Met’s paedophile unit.

The witness claims that MI5 officers sat in on a formal interview with him conducted by police. He says that police told him this after the interview.

He also claims that the Met’s Special Branch, which often works in effect as MI5’s police arm, is keeping close watch on developments.

Exaro has established that one section of the Met has been tapping the witness’s telephone.

It is also understood that a Special Branch officer has been posing as a journalist in an attempt to contact several witnesses in Operations Fernbridge and Fairbank. One officer falsely claimed to the key witness to be a reporter from the Sunday People.

The developments have raised alarm because of the intelligence services’ track-record to help cover up evidence of child sex abuse by senior politicians and other prominent people, such as Sir Cyril Smith, the former Liberal MP who was exposed as a paedophile following his death in 2010.

These were first called Entitlement Cards before being renamed to Identity Cards and getting them through Parliament was a major headache for David Blunkett and the Labour administration at the time due to heavy resistance from the public and the Conservatives.

The abolition of the Identity Cards and the National Identity Register was an explicit part of the coalition agreement following the most recent election. One of the last remaining vestiges of the project is the fact that the agency issuing passports is called the Identify &amp; Passport Service, which is what the UK Passport Agency was renamed to when the cards became part of their remit.

In terms of buying tickets, you can only generally get them about 3 home games in advance (about a month) so work out when they'll come on sale. Go on the website, then you can pick seats etc. Its all pretty straight forward, but yeah, bear in mind that you can't get them months in advance.

He, or the producers, need to learn that less is more. One day I hope there'll be a way to reduce the volume of the music, or remove it altogether, and I might be able to rewatch certain episodes.

Also, the sound effects are tacky and cheap sounding. The 'pew pew' sounds they always use for weapons are just embarrassing.

If we slow the game down, make Stoke chase us in the midfield, we can take control of the game and feed the ball from mid to attack more effectively.

2- The Sonic he carries is directly upgraded from 8's TV movie model

3- His Sonic's also the first with the diode style all the future Doctors will carry, so we know where it originated from: the battlefield

4- The clothes blend elements of 8 &amp; 9's looks so well his part was deduced long before the 50th by other fans 

5- Cowboy stirrups, boots, and a leather belt that make him look like a Wild West Marshall; the sheriff keeping order 

6- A scarf like 4, but not exaggerated, more like he actually wears it to stay warm in/after battle, with a few frayed threads showing age

7- It makes him a bridge between the classic &amp; revival series

8- He's the only Doctor with a war armament- the bandolier, and it's actually a meaningful keepsake

9- He uses the bandolier as a utility belt for his Sonic

* postmarked/dated envelopes of letters you've written to each other

* shared bank accounts and bills, or shared large purchases. e.g. car

Not only that, but the proof we can provide is VERY limited: I was 16 years old 3 years ago, so I didn't pay bills or my council tax because I was 16 living and with my mother. To this day I don't have a P60 because I'm a goddamn student and it seems i only have one choice to prove I'm entitled to the grant - Bank Statements.... which I might not have because not all 16 year olds are required to have bank accounts. 

At the same time I've just received my permanent residence, which PROVES I'VE BEEN HERE FOR 5 YEARS because I CAN ONLY GET IT BY PROVING I'VE BEEN HERE FOR 5 OR MORE YEARS, but is it acceptable proof? FUCK NO!

Then I get a call from my friend whose been here for 9 years and has British Citizenship (which requires a year to pass from your permanent residence visa is issued, suggesting 6 years residence at the least) and guess what?

What?

&gt;Also, achieving goals of quitting EU by belonging to EU parliament is like killing enemies at war, being dressed as an enemy (war clearly being something more serious than some EU).

Okay... 

So? I mean I get the analogy. UKIP and similar parties to them in the EU Parliament are surrounded by ideological opponents and they make it clear their purpose is to act as opposition and campaign, publicise for countries to call for referendums to leave.

&gt;Not really. They campaign for Britain, not Europe so why would they want for EU to stop existing? Pretty much all of the stuff they say focuses on UK, not EU or Europe.

You obviously know very little about this. Nigel Farage works or has worked with other Anti-EU parties in his group for the decade or so he's been elected there. He supports publicly nations such as Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Italy etc to have referendums on whether they want to leave and has argued repeatedly to the EU Parliament that he hopes it all breaks up.

&gt;OK. What about government paying for Olympics even though I would like them being out of such sporting events? Why would I join an Olympics commission which decides about which sportsman does what and other stuff, rather than start an organisation completely separate from it?

Publicity. More accurately, you could get employed and/or promoted into organisations that fund the Olympics and try to press for those organisations to defund them.

On that note some things we need to improve on, Skrtel is going to be giving away a penalty soon, it's a matter of time. He's being targetted every game from commentators for shirt pulling and when he laid on Shawcross, that should have been a penalty.

Migs didn't really have a good game. The Walters goal was cringe worthy, as was the soft header that Crouchy scored. He's been having a more difficult time in goal as of late. Does it matter much in the grand scheme of things? Not if we score more than our opponent.

It wont just repeat itself because major breakthroughs were made prior to and during ww2 which couldn't be fully exploited due to us being a little busy with the Germans. We had fast growth back then because we were playing technological catchup with the Americans. The ultimate source on the matter is The European Economy since 1945 by B Eichengreen. Take a look at chapters 2,3,4 and 7. Also it might be worth looking at convergence in economics.

Johnson is still an issue, I don't understand how he lost all his dribbling skills and speed. Its like Downing 2.0, we know he has the skills but he's not using them for some reason. Every time he gets the ball, he waits then does the most predictable thing.

Coutinho needs a rest I think, the last few games he played, he missed at least one sitter, his passing hasn't been as good. Sometimes he shoots when he should clearly pass (especially since he misses or shoots it at the keeper most of the time). He's still young and it takes skill to be in goal scoring positions in the first place, but he just really needs to work on his finishing.

true,pylori,cnty-england,East Midlands,"&gt;I think what he may be talking about is when they reengineer a drug and use the right handed version of the molecule instead of the left.

What they may do is sell it as enantiopure as opposed to a racemic mixture (when they determine the optically active enantiomer), but it seems unlikely that after using an L isomer they'd switch to the D for patenting reasons, not the least because each enantiomer usually behaves slightly differently in the body. I also don't think an enantiopure version would qualify for a new patent, it's still the same thing. But, like I said, *if* they did qualify for a new patent they'd have to go through clinical trials which are expensive as fuck, so it's not like it's as easy as putting a new sticker on it.

&gt;Most drugs havent been tested against each other to see which is the most effective out of them.

They do tons of studies to find out the efficacy of drugs with respect to each other. Of course there's so many medications out there that doing all the therapeutic permutations possible is not feasible, but it's not like doctors just go based on what the brochure says. People tend to dismiss doctors as easily succumbing to the marketing literature, but people often forget that doctors also do read the medical literature and stay on top of their game with regards to the medicines and procedures they use.

It is the responsibility of the doctor prescribing the medication to know about it. That's not just some vague ""oh yeah it lowers blood pressure"", but the details.

Don't worry too much about the goals scored today. the first goal could have been saved if Migno was in a better position. This goal was not the fault of the CB's, its peter fucking crouch. He's a giant. Also a lot of the nervy chances were because Cissohko is a terrible defender. He's in front of charlie adam a majority of times and he's giving him space as if he's Aaron Lennon. A smarter fullback would have been right up in Adams face because there is little chance that adam will beat a man on the first step. Add to that the fact that Gerrard was playing DM and the  back four did not have nearly the same amount of protection and support that Lucas can provide.

Gerrard did well defensively, I've seen lots of good work from him these past two years whereas earlier in his career he didn't seem to fit in a defensive position. If he adapts it could be a good move for him.

His passing suffered a bit, but not sure how much that had to do with Stoke and the pitch, or his move in position. 

I think what Rodgers is trying to do is to get the best out of Gerrard, in spite of his aging. By playing him deeper he isn't subject to quite the same pressing in midfield where Gerrard's lack of acceleration can put him in trouble. We still get his leadership, distribution and set pieces in this role. Early in the game where we were under pressure he made a big impact by throwing himself around, it was great to see because we lack aggression in the side.

Technically, today the 3 of Gerrard, Lucas, and Hendo made sense because Allen is out. And I'm not sure I'd prefer Allen in over Gerrard or Lucas (wow, who'd have ever thought Hendo was the irreplaceable one?). I think ultimately we'll need an upgrade there.

But, in giving Gerrard the Quarterback role (to borrow an Americanism as an American...) we lose what Lucas is best at in the DM role. Which is reading the game and intercepting. He is not the hound dog that Hendo can be. His pressing is best in tandem and from deep. So we have Gerrard, who can't read the game as well from back there, constantly being beaten because he can't cut out the pass.

Going forward against more clinical sides I see us being undone by this. I understand Rodger's dilemma and I don't know if there's a better solution at present. But today was very sad.

After seeing what we are like with 2 active mids pressing the ball, I'm sure he doesn't want to go back. This is the Liverpool he wanted from the start, one that presses hard. We've only seen that a handful of times when Gerrard is further advanced, but we see it all the time when he's not playing. Playing Lucas up higher is good too because he takes those distribution skills higher up the pitch. He got on the ball a lot less today, but still was effective in creating pockets of space with his movement and as usual his passing was instant. no dwelling on the ball. Speaking of this, Gerrard's number one priority will be to learn how to play the simple and quick pass a la Lucas Leiva. he needs to be the distributor now, but its in his DNA too try and take responsibility. He gave away quite a few today trying to do this. Needs to learn to pick his moments. Exciting to see where this leads. He's a good tackler, now he just needs to control his positioning and accept his new role with a change in mentality.

1. Toure and Skrtel are a shocking partnership 2 games 6 conceded
2. Henderson, Coutinho, and Sterling need a lot of shooting practice
3. Sterling deserves to keep his place even if it means Sturridge starts on the bench
4. Cissokho and Johnson were average. More should be expected both offensively and defensively. Stoke managed to get in over 50 crosses. Not good enough
5. The mentality of the team is changing for the better. Last season we'd have lost that game.
6. It was good to see decisions go our way for a change. Mark Hughes can be very unhappy with the officals.
7. Gerrard showed again that although he can be defensively suspect and can't really play the high tempo pressing game when we don't have possession, he still world class when we do and are going forward.

We weren't at out fluid best today the defence were very poor as a whole but going forward we were too much for a difficult Stoke side we scored 5 could and probably should have had at least 2 more.

* He's probably naturally skilled enough to adapt to almost any position, so I'm not too worried about that.

* If you can't buy cover/competition for Lucas, use Gerrard as that cover/competition. I think in the long run it'll probably be Gerrard or Lucas on the pitch at once and we can have someone else with more energy and who is more of a scoring threat going forward. 

* Gives us that Toure-level vet experience and organization in the defense (albeit not the back line) without actually having to play Toure.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Not a modern democracy as most would recognise it, but in an older sense of the word maybe. 

The Glorious Revolution was not simply a victory over Catholics, it was part of a wider political struggle in Europe against the French, (the pope being one of William's allies). 

James II started appointing Catholics in to high positions in the Army, then removed arms from Protestants (something which happened previously before every persecution of Protestants, Hitler also disarmed the Jews), fearing persecution in another Catholic dynasty, members of parliament decided that they should replace James II with his daughter and son in law. William landed in England (Torbay) in 1688, James fled to France where he met his cousin  Louis (who happened to be the king of France.)

In 1689 the Bill of Rights became law, a document based on the work of classical liberal John Locke, that granted men equal rights freedom of religion (which would have went well if not for the Anglican Church) and the right to hold arms for defence from oppression and attack. The Divine right of kings had been blown away from British law and a standing Army was only allowed if Parliament said so, paving the way for our modern democracy.

It is these ideals which we celebrate, not the dethroning of a Catholic but the rights and freedoms of men which followed.

James however was not so pleased, the idea of a people being governed by the man they wanted didn't sit well if that man wasn't him, so he attempted to take his crown back by force, the French would help provided England and her navy joined the war on the French side. 

England being to hard to take initially the plan was to take Ireland first gathering support from the Catholics there and then take England and the Crown.

First however the forces loyal to William (Williamites) had to be taken care of two garrisons were in Ulster, at Londonderry and Enniskillen. Enniskillen was taken and Derry put under siege. Reinforments arrived to Derry after 105 days, winning the siege for the Williamites.

This is such a widely spread POV so I'm not addressing this to you individually but arguments about sovereignty are so ill conceived. 

I suppose they also want out of the UN also, and the WTO, and NATO and every international treaty ever signed that constricts what parliament may do. Nuclear proliferation? No, we should have the final say over selling nuclear secrets to dictatorships and so should every other country - the safety of the rest of humankind is a secondary concern. Chemical weapons, child labour, slavery? No these issues should be governed by national sovereignty alone and no international standard should be set! I presume they also hold these values if they are concerned about total national supremacy? 

To be frank, the idea that we would have national sovereignty without the EU is bizarre - we haven't had total sovereignty for decades if not centuries. Our oldest alliance is with Portugal and is 641 years old. It's been used many times to benefit us but it's also acted to constrict us and technically until we are no longer bound by it, our sovereignty is not whole. We intervened in the Seven Years War because of that treaty and we helped defend Portugal during the Napoleonic Era because they used the treaty to force us to (not that it wasn't in our interests also). Total national sovereignty is isolationism - imagine if a company vowed never to be bound by a contract or regulation. 

If these MPs disagree with a particular forfeiture of sovereignty then they need to make the argument based on why the features of that sovereignty are not worth giving up. To suggest that the mere fact that we are giving up some powers is a sufficient argument to oppose the EU is blind to politics and history.

Exactly. Legalising drugs would probably be a massive economic boon far outweighing the cost the cost to the NHS. It's not like a bunch of people don't already need medical help because of their illegal drugs use. 

My question is what are politicians real motives behind keeping drugs illegal? Basically every aspect of doing it would be an improvement on the current situation.

Of course, but all that seemed largely beside the point in terms of patents and drug companies which is what this thread was about. And drug companies hiding or not publicising information is far removed from a doctor doing underhanded stuff like giving a patient a certain medication because of ties to the drug companies and what have you (which was also another implication).

&gt; this wonderful new drug for blood pressure they are far more likely to prescribe the one they were ""taught"" all about.

I disagree. Though again this is different from the problems I had originally, I don't think it's fair to assume that a doctor will just take the marketing at face value. Any half-decent doctor will do their own research about the drug and its effects before prescribing it to any patient. The GMC is very clear about this in their [prescribing guidelines](http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/ethical_guidance/14316.asp).

3: Hazard. Had a very good game and caused trouble non stop towards Hull. Clever link up with Ashley Cole here and there and love the way he cuts in from out wide. Easy choice. 

2: Luiz. I've said for a long time he's a brilliant midfielder, regardless of what mourinho said at the start of the season, I get the impression he's starting to see it. His quick, snappy, direct passes are what set him ahead of mikel for me. Mikel seems very slow which is great if you're trying to break down play but when you need to split the 2 banks of 4 Luiz is your man. 

1: Torres. He didn't have the greatest of games but when it mattered he made it count. Done some bits that I hadn't seen in a while.

Suarez and Sturridge are both creative and smart by themselves. Often times strikers require service but these two can create for others and themselves. This means Coutinho is less necessary. Sterling can stretch defenses too and benefit hugely from Sturridge and Suarez getting all the attention. Whereas Coutinho can't be that man breaking the offside trap.

I don't know what to say about the squads under Dalglish and Hodgson, but they didn't try. Without Gerrard it was just Kuyt running like a chicken with his head cut off. In our side right now we've got Suarez busting ass, Hendo busting ass, and everyone else actually working hard if not at their levels of determination (which can just be a matter of athleticism, because Lucas and our back 4 all work hard).

It used to be we didn't have that. 

I think right now we'd be better off signing someone to play in the pressing role and putting Lucas at DM where he can read the game, intercept, and occasionally break up play.

Then you bring Gerrard on for set pieces and nerve in the final 30 minutes. Or you use him against sides who can't take advantage of a weaker defensive side.

Added to that they have co-presidency of an EU bloc which has representatives from eleven other countries in it, and they split much of their committee obligations with their coalition partners.  Farage for example doesn't even sit on a committee anymore (he used to sit on fisheries).  Stuart Agnew took that one up but there are plenty of committees which UKIP doesn't attend at all, they allow another bloc member to pick it up and then they get the notes for when it comes to a vote.  They look how the other blocs will vote and calculate their resolve from there.

For example, on the Transport &amp; Tourism committee there are two members and three substitutes for a total of five representatives: these consist of two Italians, a Lithuanian, a Greek, and a Pole.  This is how the EU 'operates'!  It's impossible for all but the larger parties to physically have representatives in all committees and on all delegations.  On the regional development committee there are zero UKIP representatives; there is a Frenchman, a Pole, a Czech, an Italian, and the same Lithuanian.  In that case the Lithuanian, the former mayor of Vilnius, you'd expect to have a much higher attendance rate than say Farage  because he sits on 2 committees and 4 delegations.  Farage however now only attends the Conference of Presidents and doesn't sit on any committees or delegations.

It doesn't mean they don't get to vote on it they just get the notes and minutes of the meeting.  The EFD employs researchers which UKIP contributes to (or more accurately UKIP claims and makes the EU pay for).  It does however mean their official attendance is affected.  But meh, so what?  It's only another useless EU stat.  Some of the people that have high attendance are signing in and sodding off straight away anyway.  [**There are videos of MEPs getting caught doing it.

The etymology of the word becomes virtually irrelevant, because it's grown beyond that.

The reactions people have to the word speaks to their own experience I suppose. When it's the word you hear shouted at you as you walk down a street, it's offensive. When it's the word screamed in your face as you're kicked and punched because you are wearing a Catholic primary school uniform, it's offensive. When you tell your father about why you're crying and he confides in you about the time the floor manager for a factory called him a ""fucking fenian bastard"" in a failed job interview, but that you'll be better and flourish because of it, it's offensive.

If the music is correctly chosen for the scene/moment, you won't even notice it. Great music can make you cry, it can make you want to dance, it'll make you want to flip a table in frustration, and that's before the actors step in.

No it isn't and if you were to ask some Irish or Scottish people about it (hopefully someone academic and or historians) they will tell you so.

&gt;Erm, the Scottish independence issue is being decided on a Scottish level not a UK level.

Only because UK allowed them to do it!

&gt;The EU parliament makes decisions that affect the UK the same way that the UK parliament makes decisions that affect the home nations.

EU decisions mostly apply here to common market and things within whole Europe. They don't interfere with everything.

&gt;It is by standing for election on these issues that the parties bring support to these ideals

Yes, but locally where those things can actually be implemented. Not on another planet.

&gt; If the predictions are true and a majority of seats go to the party that wishes to leave then the mainstream political parties will have to take notice

You mean majority of EU elections from UK parties? So basically people say we want to quit EU but don't want to vote UKIP? Otherwise UKIP would have won majority in UK elections.

&gt;Hell the promised EU referendum from the conservatives came as a response to the rise of UKIP.

After all they are both right wing, aren't they?

&gt;Hence why I will be voting for them, so as to get a referendum

true,pharao007,null,null,"&gt;The EU ""allows"" members to quit, there's even a provision in the Lisbon treaty

That's why countries join EU, otherwise none would. I don't think UK gave full rights of leaving UK to Irish and Scottish straight away.

&gt; UK parliament decisions don't ""interfere with everything"" also (Scots have their own legal system and there are the various devolved assemblies)

I haven't looked at topic in details but am pretty sure those laws were added in time. Not like  from the very beginning.

&gt; No you've miss understood, UKIP (a pretty much single issue party) are widely predicted to win the coming European election. Their sheer performance in the Locals last year has forced the main three parties to become more eurosceptic, a UKIP first place will bring more support for a referendum from the main parties.

Current polls don't really give a certain win to UKIP in any elections.

&gt;Euroscepticism is not confined to either side of the political spectrum.

In Farage's view it is only one sided.

&gt;Look you're new to this country so I'll explain it to you: Labour are weak minded vote grabbers. They've already gone eurosceptic following the UKIP performance in the locals last year. If UKIP do well then they'll offer a referendum. The Conservatives are offering one, the Lib Dems offered one the last time around so it can be assumed they'll offer one again. Ed Milliband has already stated that they'll offer one if there are any future treaty changes and luckily enough there are rumblings on the continent that a new treaty is needed as a response to the financial crisis. It isn't a stretch for them to offer one following a strong UKIP performance.

Haha. I would say most parties are vote grabbing people (look Conservatives, look UKIP). Obviously it's hard to predict whether Labour will or not give a referendum. I'm more keen on observing the voting predictions. They will not say anything about referendum unless they start significantly loosing possible votes. So far they only gained.

&gt;It's just a referendum, why do you fear democracy? Why don't you want the people to have a say?

Referendum is obviously a good thing and I think UK should eventually have EU referendum if big numbers of people actually want it. I just don't think it should be done now. Why? Simply because average citizens and voters are emotional. They are not specialists in the field of economy and similar. They will vote EU referendum now with hearts, rather than minds. If UK quits EU it's pretty permanent, meaning this decision will have a huge future impact. Also, I think it's better to be even in a bit worse situation but knowing how bad it is, rather than go fully open and risk a lot (possibly gain but not much). 

Why UK wants a referendum coincidentally where there is a world's crisis? Because plenty of people blame EU and although EU could have been somehow responsible for it, it's well proven that it was a banking crisis (started in USA) which started whole crisis chain. Quitting EU now is not much different from crime in passion (where with most such crimes people are sure about the other person's fault - EU fault is not established here).

P.S. I personally don't care that much about it as opposed to UK nationals I will have both UK and EU passports, meaning I won't be restricted with most of the things Brits risk to lose. As I think of UK now as my country I think though that the light decision of quitting EU is generally bad for UK and that is where I make my case.",0,1389563266,null,0,false,0,cenxyhr,t3_1v14vy,t1_cenxyhr,t1_cenx9s8,null,1431914065,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,northernmonk,eng-wiltshire,Moonraker,"&gt;The only way to not give a flying fuck about politics is to have been conditioned to believe that you can't change a thing

And there in lies the issue. As someone who's under 25, many of my friends don't vote. A political system where over 50% of the seats are considered [safe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_seat#United_Kingdom) and your vote won't make the slightest bit of difference really doesn't help that, and to be honest if I'm living in a constituency like that at the next election I see no reason to do anything other than spoil my ballot. Even if I'm not, just look at the options:

- A party which appeared to have absolutely no grasp on financial reality over the first two years of this parliament, and continues bleat about not cutting when around half the national debt we're taking on is just to maintain the current debt. Failed to balance the budget in the good years aswell. Claims to be socialist but seems to have lost sight about what this means (if they pledged to renationalise the railways under the East Coast model it would be a good start, but when I suggested it to a labour candidate, he barely paid lip service before getting back to Tory bashing.) Has 5 MPs in the clink for fucking the taxpayer over with expenses.

- A party which claimed it knew we needed to cut, and has done so with all the care of a bull in a china shop in. I might have some respect for them if they were fulfilling their promise to get the deficit down to 0 within the life of this parliament, but have failed comprehensively on that too. 2 MPs in the clink for expenses, and something about duck ponds. 

- A party who's one big pledge to the young it threw away just for a shot at AV (might have been forgiveable if full PR/large regions using d'Hondt had been sent through parliament without a referendum.)

- A party a couple of years ago sounded ok, but now seem to have got lost up their own arses regarding Romania

- Green nutters

- Racist nutters

I'd say the political classes have done rather a good job of conditioning the current generation that they can't change a thing

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;**As far as I know their ""manifesto"" consists solely of immigration, the EU, and taking away equal marriage.** 

Sadly you've got even that wrong, although to be fair if you're not especially a politics-bug there's been a lot of deliberate misdirection from other parties.  For example you often hear the Lib Dems calling them anti-immigration, when UKIP themselves call for immigration only that it be controlled.

There's considerably more to them than immigration and the EU, although of course the EU being intrinsically entwined in everyday UK life and decision making it does crop up a lot.

Equal marriage didn't figure at all, because Cameron only introduced it in this term and people in general weren't talking about it when the 2010 manifesto was written back in 2009.  Civil partnerships had just been passed (something UKIP supported) and it took Conservatives themselves by surprise as Cameron suddenly pursued it out of left field.  Incidentally they've already said they don't want to take away SSM now that it is passed, but they do want to put measures in place to protect freedom of religion - all religion - because that was their issue with it in the first place.  They don't want any religious faith in the UK being taken to court because their religion is against SSM.  You don't have to practice that religion.  That religion doesn't get to force you to practice their religion - but by the same measure you shouldn't be able to force a religion what it does and doesn't believe in as long as they're not forcing it on people.  Get married elsewhere or in a church/place of worship more tolerant/liberal.

There's quite a bit to UKIP policy, and when you say you don't recall anything about economy or whatever, Professor Tim Congdon who writes/contributes to UKIP's policy on the economy was an advisor to Ken Clarke when he was chancellor and flipped the economy after Black Wednesday around.  [He's actually worked out how much an exit would cost, where savings could be made, and how freeing up EU regulation could add an additional 10+% on the UK's GDP over ten years.](http://ukip-ashford.co.uk/images/EU%20cost%202013.pdf)  He's an economist.  He helped set up the The Freedom Association.  He writes papers on these things.  [He's now  honourary chairman of the TFA](http://www.tfa.net/about-us/council-and-supporters/), whose council UKIP's Roger Helmer sits on, alongside UKIP financier Stuart Wheeler.  [The TFA publicises and releases economic papers they support.](http://www.tfa.net/publications/research/)  It was set up to promote smaller central government.

There's quite a bit to UKIP other than immigration and arguing an EU exit:

- they are against tuition fees.  

- they are for student grants.

- they wish to slash corporation tax

- they want to introduce a local sales tax

- they want to pass fiscal powers to county council level, and their equivalent, so they can set more of their own rates and keep more of the revenue.

- they advocate a referendum on drugs following a royal commission

- they advocate a sovereign wealth fund from shale gas and fracking.

- they advocate amalgamating NI and Income Tax for a flat rate for all but the highest earners

- they advocate increasing personal allowance to £13k

- they want to place an emphasis on apprenticeships, scrapping 50% graduate targets

- they argue for scrapping energy subsidies

- they want to invest in flood and coastal defenses, and export this expertise.

- they advocate dropping EU tariffs against Africa.
 
- they advocate scrapping 0.7% of annual GDP as a matter of course  to aid

- they advocate developing trade agreements with the anglosphere and the Commonwealth.

- they want Localism, and to devolve power

- they support Direct Democracy

- they are against Legal Aid cuts

- they promote binding local and national referendums if 10% of the electorate sign off on a question.

- they reject the party whip system arguing that representatives should represent and answer to their own  electorate first, and not the party

- they support a right to recall so the local electorate can force a re-election. 

- they want to repeal the 2008 energy act to be able to lower energy bills, and the cost to councils

- they want to scrap employer's national insurance

- they want to invite investment in nuclear and to not close coal powerstations prematurely  

- they want to make severe cuts to central government and civil service specifically targeting the MoD which has more civil servants than the army has soldiers.

- they want to use the first tranche of the cuts from the MoD to start to bring military spending back in line with mid 1990 levels so they can have independent military capability and not be pulled into other nation's foreign policies or reliant on their assistance in times of military crisis

- they are non interventionist denouncing occupation of Afghanistan, the invasion of Iraq, [and subsquent escalation in Libya, becoming involved in Mali, and now military involvement in Syria] 

- they support Proportional Representation

- they advocate enabling the agricultural sector to form cooperatives, whilst scrapping subsidies to corporates in this sector

- they wish to scrap HS2 but invest in existng infrastructure

- they were against the privatisation of the Royal Mail  

- the are against privatisation of the NHS and that it should remain free at the point of service for all

- they want to reform ATOS assessments so everybody has their own GP reports as testimony and not an ATOS 'medic' motivated to meet his targets.  That a doctor will always be present whose motive is towards the patient.

- they want to free up councils to develop brown field land

- they support a glass-stegall system so banks don't need to be bailed out again, and to put a firewall behind the highstreet customer and the riskier speculations.

...and that's pretty much just off the top off my head.

So things like fatigue, muscle pain, brain fog, hair loss, weight gain, vertigo &amp; insomnia can mean a million things. and I explained to the doctors I was aware of that. I knew the trap some people can fall into then dismissed as just being stressed or worse, being misdiagnosed with some auto-immune disease. But I made them aware of specific hypothyroid symptoms that I had. So abnormal basil temperature &amp; sign of hertoghe amongst others. oh and the fact that it's in my family - there was that.  

So, despite my symptoms &amp; the fact it was in my family, they still wouldn't test me. It was only when I told them I intended to go private that they tested me, and the results showed I had hypothyroidism.  AND THEY STILL WOULDN'T TREAT. Even with the test results, one said it was typical to women &amp; older women and hadn't heard of young men being affected by this problem. I said that was ridiculous, explained that it was the reason Ronaldo (Brazilian) retired early, and the minority of men who have it still need to be tested and treated.  
 
But anyway, I'm not angry anymore. I'm on treatment and working with a fantastic doctor. So from that I think you can infer my agreement with what you said about crap doctors. Because the diagnosis and treatment seemed straightforward and simple, I couldn't help but think that there must be factors other than clinical being taken into account.

How long can a player expect to run on past achievements and promise when there are other more deserving players?

I never said Coutinho is a shit player. Why is criticism always taken to the nth degree? I said he's been useless. Plenty of players go through ruts and this is a massive one for him. Name the last time he made one of those great incisive passes? I've only seen him hitting it 3 yards too far for at least 2 months. He cannot pick a final ball like no one else. Both Suarez, Sturridge, and Hendo are ahead of him RIGHT NOW in that capacity.

His shooting has not only been poor but selfish. He's passed up playing teammates on who are on form. He can't hit the target when he cuts in. And he's hit the goalie square on every time he gets it in the box.

I think Coutinho has the p-o-t-e-n-t-i-a-l to be a top top player. He showed that promise last year. But all these fans wearing rose-tinted glasses because he's an -inho are failing to note that Sterling has been massively dangerous and superior to him. They're different players, yes.

But what Coutinho is supposed to offer is, right now, improved when Suarez and Sturridge play together. They are both ""link"" strikers. They can create for others. Not just in the box but from around and outside. 

Think of where Suarez cross to Sturridge came from. Think of the space Sturridge dropped into before playing on Suarez with that flick.

Coutinho is certainly going to be a great link man, but we cannot drop anyone else to keep him on right now. We need Lucas on. We need Hendo on. We need Suarez and Sturridge. And Sterling is so dangerous and unplayable right now. He's made top left backs look average.

I would be changing my field entirely.  From accounting to middle office investment banking.

I have thought about a different firm but business partnering/accounting doesn't really appeal to me. I thought this current job would be hardcore accounting but it's more strategy based where you plan for the year and keep expenses in check.

I posted the above on personal finance on the 2nd jan. I met with my old manager on 6th jan where we discussed several things. I would have been promoted had I not moved and that me coming back means my time to promotion has reset but she pointed out you would be doing senior level work which will get you promoted faster. Also other factors such as expansion would play a significant role in getting involved and getting my name out there = more wage. I know I can do it and I know my old manager will give me opportunities.

But from a purely financial point of view, is it wreckless? 

Edit: currently working for a ftse100 insurance firm. The insurance industry doesn't appeal to me as I thought it would nor accounting. I realised target driven, process oriented &amp; client facing (aka my old job) is what I really loved doing.

true,lbspredh,null,null,"&gt;Discussion here focuses not on the whole idea of UK quitting EU but whether UKIP should be a part of EU's parliament, even though they don't do there ANYTHING and their main reason for being there is to show the EU that one party in UK wants a definite quit from EU.

in that case I can answer this discussion in one statement, here goes :

They won the election, they have every right to those seats and all of the benefits therein and no obligation to participate in any meaningful way and at the next elections if the people do not want that to happen they will not have those seats anymore. It's not up to you, the EU, or reddit to tell people that anti EU people cannot have seats but up to the democratic vote that the EU insists makes them anything more than a dictatorship. End of story.

&gt;If I hated the fact that Muslims wear full face veils (which obviously can directly affect me) and my only solution here would be for UK to ban all Muslims, why in the earth would I join some Muslim community group? If I didn't like those veils I would join Muslim group to try and change their views, not just to represent my hatred towards them by additionally eating their cookies and yawning at meetings.

well you might feel differently if the muslims were insisting that *you* must wear a veil. in that case it might seem appropriate to basically steal from them

I'll put it this way, not having seats would not remove them from membership of the EU, they would still face the laws handed down by the EU, so I dont see why you think it makes no sense for them to both take money from and simultaneously say fuck you to what they consider an oppressive institution

In certain circumstances, things are a bit more complicated.  For example, the Human Rights Act specifically requires courts to interpret laws in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights wherever possible and to strike down secondary legislation that cannot be interpreted in a way that is compatible with it.

Uhm... What!? That makes no sense. We're talking about a voluntary system of filters, and not ID cards. 

If I don't want filters on my internet (I don't) I'll click the ""no thanks"" button (I did).

&gt; Fact is, Parliament opposed ISP filtering,

Me too. Fortunately there's no law mandating it.

&gt; Cameron brought it in anyway. 

No, he didn't. The ISPs did. No idea why you seem to think Cameron did this. It was the ISPs who ultimately chose. Since parliament is allegedly opposed to this, and the only threat he had was legislation, which would not have passed, I think this shows a voluntary choice from the ISPs and not Cameron.

&gt; And you don't get why thats a problem, do you?

I would see it as a problem if this was government mandated, or if Cameron managed to do this without government support. Since this is a voluntary choice from the ISPs, controlled by the ISPs, which is *only* implemented if the ISP is specifically asked by the customer, I don't see what this has to do with democracy.

Did I mention that this is an ISP provided service, and not a government mandated filter?

Being allowed to use blues grants you certain privileges but not the right to go above the speed limit, which they now have. Eg the national blood service vehicles have always been allowed to use sirens to make an urgent donation but still had to obey the speed limit.

I think an MI5 officer using blue lights and sirens isn't really giving their cover away because most people would just think they're an unmarked police car.

I wonder if they would ever consider granting the london underground emergency response unit (and similar services) permission to use blues, as their inability to do so has caused problems in the past.

As for restriction, the law is the law, but I know a guy who *definitely isn't me* who rode an unrestricted 600cc bike for 12 months when it should've been, and never had an issue. The police aren't going to see a moped doing 35 in a 40 and pull it over to be sure it's restricted, they're only going to check if you're already speeding. As for crashing and worrying about insurance, they're only likely to try and check the bike for a restrictor if they think you were speeding at the time of the crash and were thus to blame. The obvious solution is to not crash, and if you do crash, do it at the speed limit. I would recommend a helmet cam that can see your speedo (and other drivers being idiots) too. 

Personally, if you can manage without a motorbike for now, I'd wait until you're 17 and get a 125.

Right now its the exact opposite. Coutinho looks his age. And Sterling looks like a fucking genius down the wing. A pure winger is really one of the most underrated positions in English football. We've moved away from it a bit due to bringing in more CAM type players. 

I think because of that change in style in our league, players like Sterling get undervalued. But right now he's proving himself every single match. The lad even drops back and disrupts play. Which is something no one ever mentions and deserves mention when you consider early on in the season we all acted like we needed a defensive minded RW because Johnson would get out of position too often.

I'm afraid you dont understand the focus of my argument. WE WILL NOT GROW LIKE WE DID AFTER WW2. We cannot borrow to the same extent we did then. We cannot afford it. I dont know in how many ways I can tell you. 

But here is why we grew so fast

a) Convergence to the level of the USA. They did all the hard work in terms of researching new tech which is a slow progress we merely adopted their practices allowing for huge leaps and bounds in total factor productivity (tfp) which is used to measure technology growth. 

Convergence is a neoclassical theory which I suggest you wikipedia.

b)Post WW2 there was a huge amount of damage to European capital. The level of capital in the economy was incredibly low, especially considering that which exsisted was geared towards war. This bassically meant huge returns on investments. This lead to investment investment investment, which grew the economy at an incredible rate.

In the bottom of the pan and in the cavity goes a bit of hot water (maybe half a pint total), and whatever herbs and vegetables will be good - carrot, onion and celery are classic, as is bay leaf, tarragon, rosemary  and maybe lemon. Garlic if you must. Also, salt and pepper

Cover with foil and seal the edges around the pan. 

Stick it into a preheated oven at, say, 200c for about two thirds of the cooking time

Take it out, remove the foil and then the chicken. Pour off all the liquid into a jug or pan. 

Put the chicken back in its pan (still on its rack) and then back into the oven, as well as the pan of roast potatoes and stuffing balls. 

Strain the liquid at this point and discard the vegetables and herbs - they have no flavour left in them. Make gravy with it. By make gravy I mean just thicken it up with some corn flour. You don't need gravy granules! If you want you could caramelise an onion first for a bit of added flavour. I like to add some balsamic vinegar and check the seasoning too. 

Once its all done with, strip the remaining meat off the bones, and boil them for stock with the remaining gravy (if there is any) and rinse the roasting pan out into the stock too - loads of deep dark flavours in there!",0,1389569304,null,0,false,0,ceo0mac,t3_1uxf2n,t1_ceo0mac,t3_1uxf2n,null,1431915321,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2

When confronted about it their defense was ""It's a free market, they can get milk anywhere."" And this is what strikes me as daft about people who want free market health care.

We can actually further a discussion around Europe once we appreciate that there are two reasonable positions to take.  I'm sold on the necessity of having to leave, that it is now beyond reform and is only moving in one very dangerous direction - but I can understand how somebody might disagree and/or not see the same things I do. 

Incidentally, on the Scottish Parliament thing what they actually said was that they'd wouldn't pay for a Scottish Parliament, but their policy on Localism states that the (what 30-32ish Scottish councils?) would just need to 10% of the electorate to support a referendum to actually establish a Scottish Parliament, you could pass it, and then it would be empowered with full Devo Max that the other county councils would be getting in England (councils in Wales, districts NIreland).  They were devolving more power than the Scottish Parliament currently has to an even lower more local level, but if Scotland wanted to pass that power back up to a Scottish national level in Holyrood then that's Scotland's choice.

They have since then announced that whilst they think the Welsh Assembly is a bad idea it's clear that the Welsh disagree and so they've withdrawn any opposition to it.  A Welsh UKIP MEP is standing down in 2014 because he disagrees, but the party has said like it or not that's what they want so if you regrettably feel you have to leave then we'll do it on good terms.  That there's no point forcing a referendum that's clearly going to pass.

I *SUSPECT* when [David Coburn](https://twitter.com/davidcoburnukip) moves permanently back up to Glasgow this/next month now he's left the LondonUKIP chairmanship he'll come with a similar clarifying message as to Wales, and offering full Devo-Max.

true,pairyhenis,eng-hampshire,Hampshire (Soton and a bit of Wiltshire),"A couple of things I have issue with (I should probably state, as a research scientist in academia):

&gt;Drug design is a tricky business and tens of millions will be spent on research compounds before a drug even gets to the stage of animal trials let alone testing on humans (which may not work) or seeing if it's viable to produce in bulk (it may not be) or even if sufficient profit can be turned to make it worthwhile bringing out (still no guarantee).

A lot of basic research is done by public institutions anyway and mined/exploited/sold to pharma

&gt;For every drug that comes to the market, there are hundreds of millions spent on every other compound that did NOT come to market for all the reasons above. It really is no joke when drug companies claim that it can cost upwards of one billion dollars to bring a new drug to market.

So Big Pharma claims. This ignores: work built largely on public research, the huge amount of money equally spent on marketing of ineffective drugs, evergreening soon-to-be-out-of-patent drugs.  Remember, Big Pharma isn't just out to recoup expenses; they are out to improve profits year on year.  That is a big, big difference.

&gt; So, whenever someone says that drug companies are evil and only think of the money... well yes, of course they are going to think of the money as it's simply not viable for this sort of R&amp;D to be publicly funded.

That makes it OK to be ""evil"" and perpetually rig studies in your favour/hide trial results/influence regulating bodies?

&gt; I can fully believe that there might be some degree of price gouging with new drugs, but there is also that $1bn to recoup before any profit is turned, all whilst the patent clock is tick tick ticking in the background.

At the risk of sounding preachy, read Bad Pharma, or Ben Goldacres post's on the all trials campaign and Big Pharma integrity/finances.

I'm a young professional based outside of London, but know plenty based in London itself.  All of them are sharing with at least one other person and, despite this, somehow end up paying at least the same *each* every month in Zone 2 rent and council tax than I do while living alone in Colchester.  My place is actually quite big and it's in a good area, unlike some of my friends who can't go one evening without police sirens and in extreme cases distant gun shots.

The ""But you get to live in London!"" argument is fast running out of steam.  Nobody ever makes 100% use of everything London has to offer (which, in many cases, is the exact same as pretty much anywhere else, especially if you've got a suburban family life).  These people don't exactly go out every night of the week and when they do, they're in central London paying £9 for a pint and sprinting for the last Tube home at 11pm.

People will eventually get fed up of house sharing (it's cool and quite good fun up until your mid/late 20s), and then what?  They likely can't afford to live alone in London, and almost certainly can't afford to buy: what do you do in that situation?  Leave London?  Urgently find yourself a partner and ""settle down"" because it saves you some money without it feeling like having a flatmate?

Secondly, as for voting record, Farage has also pointed out a multitude of times that MEPs are basically in a voting factory rubber stamping commission recommendations without having any time whatsoever to realistically understand what the hell it is they're voting for.

You may remember that a few years ago, the EU Parliament actually *rejected* a bill, and this was so unusual that it was headline news (first time in a decade that a bill wasn't just automatically rubber stamped by a rubber stamp parliament).

Farage has made no secret of these as being issues. He has relentlessly pointed out the absurdity of these issues. This is not news and he hasn't been caught out.

true,smokey815,num11,,"Aside from calling a very common formation ""AVB's 4-2-3-1,"" some decent points.  I would like to point out that a 4-2-3-1/4-3-3 under Sherwood would be very different than it was with AVB by the way, they both showed different philosophies.  But that's another argument.

With Soldado, it's interesting.  He's clearly got the ability to put the ball in, we've seen that before.  But he's not doing it, for whatever reason.  Early on I'd chalk it up to being almost an after thought at times for our attacks.  Whether or not he gets the service he needs to thrive I believe depends entirely on the system we play and his role in it.

I agree that having at least one proper wide player would be beneficial in terms of getting him chances.  But the thing is, do we keep playing him with Ade, or do we play one instead of the other?

I think that if we truly want to dedicate ourselves to playing with one striker, and using that striker as the focal point of our attack, then Soldado best suits that idea.  If that is the case, then we'd likely see Lennon and Townsend on the wings, with one of Eriksen/Chadli/Lamela playing off of him.  A 4-2-3-1 with a finisher requires the kind of service that we'd get from an attacking three with proper wingers and a playmaker.  We'd like play a different game with Ade as a lone striker, but this is about Soldado, so I'll leave that.

We also could stick with Sherwood's funky 4-4-2.  Soldado's role in this system is interesting, because of yesterday.  Earlier with this system, we saw both Soldado and Ade dropping deep to link up and help create.  Interestingly enough, Soldado was the deeper of the two quite often.  I personally found that odd because he's the poacher.  THe one you expect to be putting the ball in the back of the net.  Then yesterday, he just stuck in line with the back four.  Few runs, little movement.  Just looked overall uninterested honestly.  It was an odd departure from what we'f seen.  And for me, a return to the problems he had earlier this year with AVB.  He just didn't do anything.

I don't know if that change was the result of him being told to try and get into goal scoring positions, to try and be more of a scoring threat, but that didn't happen.  I've been rambling a bit, but I guess the point I'm getting at is that Soldado's involvement is basically going to be a result of the rest of our squad.  He won't make his own chances very often, so he needs to be played in a system where he will be given chances, and where his primary role is finishing them.  Of course, that relies entirely on whether or not he regains for and actually starts putting them in when given the chance.

Edit:  And in watching that video of his goals and assists, he had *a lot* of one touch finishes.  He constantly found a pocket of space where he could receive the ball and instantly direct in on goal.  I think players like Lamela and Eriksen are the guys who can give him that ball.  Townsend too, to a lesser extent.  Lot of low crosses as well.",0,1389575947,null,0,1389594897,0,ceo3hpt,t3_1v2ibr,t1_ceo3hpt,t3_1v2ibr,null,1431916750,15,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,15

As you suggested, I do think Sherwood likely instructed Soldado to stay closer to goal, as Adebayor is just as effective at build up as Soldado. But the way that Palace were sitting in so deep, it didn't leave much room at all for Soldado to make any vertical runs as Spurs worked it around the ball around the box to look for a point of penetration. It seemed to have the same frustrations boil up for Roberto, and the apathy we've seen out of him when he wasn't getting service started creeping back in. Hopefully it was just a one off frustration, and that he's getting acquainted to this new approach.

I disagree. His passing is still fantastic, and opponents respect his presence, which gives more space to the players around him. I think his biggest problem is that he's impatient. Many times when there's no incisive pass available he decides that his best option is to take a mid 2000's Gerrard shot from 40 yards, when that's obviously not his game, at least not at this point in his career. I was hoping his goal against City would have calmed him down some but it doesn't appear so unfortunately

While we obviously want Soldado to bang in 20 goals a season at what point do we say it's about adapting Soldado to our style of play rather than our play to Soldado. We have to remember that we have 7 really top quality new players and at least 4 of them have had their difficulties settling in. We're starting to see Eriksen really thrive, as well as Paulinho before he got injured. Chiriches is starting to get some experience in the EPL, but there are still the likes of Capoue, Chadli and especially Lamela who are still finding it tough. It's impossible to cater our style of play to all of them. The difference between Soldado and the other 3 I just mentioned is that Soldado has had a lot of game time and been given the chance to adapt. So while it's easy to say the others just need more game time, it's hard to say the same for Soldadod.

What needs to be done? Unfortunately no one can truly know. I think he needs some time on the bench while we give Lamela a chance to integrate under Sherwood's new style (seemed to work wonders for Paulinho). Soldado is a very good player, there's no doubt about that, but if we give him a bit of a rest and bring him back when the team has a bit of momentum, maybe he'll feel like there's less pressure on him to score, because he knows that the team will perform.",0,1389580941,null,0,false,0,ceo5jwf,t3_1v2ibr,t1_ceo5jwf,t1_ceo406z,null,1431917723,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"You can't in any way write off a striker based on half a season in a new league, but the pressures of modern football towards the top of the league mean it's always going to happen.  Last year people were calling Giroud a flop; this year he's leading the line in a title-challenging side.

I do not for a second doubt Soldado's class.  But nor do I think tactics are entirely to blame.  It was painfully obvious (as the article points out) that AVB had no idea how to use him properly.  He couldn't play to his strengths.  But still... he's had the opportunities.

I don't think he needs to be scoring every second game to be deemed a success, but he should have put away at least 2-3 of the chances that have fallen his way in the last 10 games.  Consistently playing him and holding out hope may be the right thing to do, but there is a time when a player needs to be dropped.

Man management has got to be the trickiest but most important part of any manager's job.  Sherwood needs to find a way to get the best out of Soldado.  Giving him an automatic starting berth - with no real striking competition as long as we play two upfront - despite being in a rut has surely got to be a bit dispiriting.  The pressure never alleviates, the expectation never drops, but you're not really feeling in the zone either.

Some time off might help him, but it might make him worse.  Giving him a run for the last 30 mins of each match, particularly against easier opponents, might see him sneak a goal or two late on.

Buying another quality striker in this window has got to be a must for me.  Give Soldado something to fight for, give ourselves another option to draw upon.

I worry that when we come up the likes of Arsenal, Man City or Liverpool again, he may not get many openings to score.  Perhaps only one per match.  If he can't take those, our job gets a crapload harder.",0,1389580983,null,0,false,0,ceo5ki9,t3_1v2ibr,t1_ceo5ki9,t3_1v2ibr,null,1431917730,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

But that lineup is one that could easily provde Soldado with loads of good chances, while still having danger through Lamel driving in and Paulinho driving forward.  We've also seen that Eriksen has an eye for goal.  Townsend also has a wicked shot on him, as long as he knows when to use it.

We find out that hundreds- thousands, maybe- of years took place between seasons, and the Doctor is on his final regeneration. Then, throughout the rest of the next few series, Doctors thirteen through thirteen through twenty three become recurring characters. From the perspective of the twenty fourth Doctor, we see not only his own life, but the lives of many previous Doctors. Every time a new character is introduced, fans will speculate whether or not (s)he's ""The Doctor."" And the twenty fourth Doctor would have some kind of ""prophecy"", like the Tenth Doctor; he's destined to die after he witnesses all of their regenerations. After that, they can explain how he gets more regenerations, and do it right (a large part of why I think they should do this is that the ending of ""The Time of the Doctor"" was really rushed and stupid. Why even have a ""limit"" in the first place, if Time Lords will grant a new cycle to anyone who asks nicely?).

The obvious are “passion” and “intensity” along of course with “sloppy” (in every sense of the word).  But there were so many sub-stories among the big stories and these stories are what made this game incredible.


**The Obvious**

*	We lost a 2-0 lead and it was to two former Reds who were the culprits.  To make matters worse, we then gave up a goal to a Blue Scouser to bring the game within 1 goal further down the line.  I am proud to say though that for the sake of the drama alone, this is simply poetic.


*	The penalty on Sterling is a major source of debate and I am one who would say it was probably a bit harsh against Stoke on this one, however I feel it is only harsh because I have grown accustomed to not having the debatable calls in our favour in recent years (See Goodison Park 2012).  But Sterling was brought down by a leg that was in his way and simply put, that is a foul and as such it should have been given.


*	Our defense looked suspect once again, but to be fair the place looked a mess to play in.  That is all I can say, Stoke got very fortunate to have 2 goals scored through defender legs and our boys threw themselves in front of everything they could.


*	Our supporters once again were fantastic.  As someone sitting at home yelling at the set, there was no doubt our fans were there in full voice.  


**The Less Obvious**

*	Our goal keeper kept us in the match once again with some fantastic (and very timely) stops on top of the few difficulties.   Mignolet showed once again that as his experience grows, he will be capable of single-handedly stealing matches for the club notwithstanding the odd moment of difficulty. 


*	That sublime goal from Suarez which was a result of a masterful pass by Sturridge was made possible by a Martin Skrtel tackle at the other end of the pitch.  It was not all gloom for our defense and this play was instrumental in securing the 3 points.


*	Luis Suarez is showing himself to not only be one of the finest talents on the planet but he is showing himself to be more and more a leader on this squad.  For no better example watch the goal celebration from the boys after the Sturridge goal and look for Suarez to beckon Raheem Sterling to get in the celebration.  The lads were 100% unified at that moment.  This is a great example of the quality of Luis’ football character and we should all hope to see this for the rest of the season and beyond.


*	The boss wants to win.  That is a great thing.


This is exactly the character game our lads needed for the next run of matches.  There are so many positives to take from this game but none more than the resolve of this club today.  I cannot imagine any team in this league would want to face our squad right now after playing a poor technical match in horrible conditions at a stadium that is as tough as anywhere to play, yet leaving with 5 goals in tow.  Initially, my only disappointment in this match was that didn’t happen prior to the Chelsea and City matches, but as I remembered that the goal of making the Champions League this year is the first point of order, it may be more telling of the quality of this squad that it happened *after* those two difficult losses.  Our lads are hungry and it shows and if we do end up cracking the top 4 this year I feel this game will go down of one of the defining matches of the year.

Generically speaking, there are two PL clubs who have FFP issues over the last few years- us and Man City, although as you say the penalties for FFP violation are not really set as of yet (there was some talk of demotion to Europa from CL for offenders, although I think that unlikely to happen personally).  Any way you look at it, we most certainly need to reign in our spending a bit as running at constant losses simply adds debt to the club which is not a good thing at all (we were back up to ~80M+ in debt again as of the last official financial release and I suspect we may well break 100M once the 2013 financial release is made).

A club record signing who has world class potential, but is currently not getting minutes.  And playing relatively poorly in the few he does get?  Click bait for days.

But the fans aren't helping.  We're clamoring for the kid to start.  We need to let both Lamela and the club take the time necessary for *him* to be ready.  It won't be good for the club and it won't be good for Lamela if we throw him out there before he's ready.

As far as a move goes, I think it would be counter productive to send him out on loan.  Theoretically he could go out to a lower table PL side, which would help get him used to the league.  But making sure he's integrated to the squad as well is equally important.  So it doesn't make sense for his development.  It almost makes zero sense for the club.  We'd be down to Azza on the right.  He's been playing well, but he can't play every match.

I filled in the form online, it was then printed out and sent to me to check and complete. I think it's much the same procedure as renewing a passport, but you will need your photos countersigned and you will have to send an original copy of your birth certificate with your application. The list of people who can countersign your photos is quite extensive so you shouldn't have any trouble on that count. 

I had to do it twice as I didn't have my parents' passport numbers when I filled it in the first time. I assumed that since they haven't been out of the country for 30 years they probably didn't have one. Stupid me, but if you bollocks up the first application there's no problem about starting again. It takes about a week for the form to be sent to you after filling it in online, so that's really no big deal as long as you don't need it in a hurry.

I was asked to come to interview as they wondered why it had taken so long for me to apply for my first passport. In reality it hadn't, but they didn't have any records of my previous passports.

Sorry but Agger and Skrtel have had their chances at the club and at this point you would have to say they just never were good enough.

Without that extra £30-£40mil, the only way we can reinforce the squad is to develop players of a high caliber or players of a decent caliber and sell them. Sadly, this is far less reliable than buying top talent, so FFP could actually create a gap between the big clubs and everyone else when its aim is the opposite.

Also, FFP doesn't allow for teams to save smaller amounts and then spend in large amounts when they feel it prudent, such as in the case of a team like Stoke who has finished mid-table a lot in the last 5 years and now would want to push on for EL football, perhaps.

I am more disappointed with his shot stopping these few games to be honest. There are very preventable goals. For example, the Walters goal that slipped away right under him (yes I know it was also a poor piece of defending) but I feel like he could have done better. The Chelsea goal that he got a hand to it but still went in etc, things like that.  

Then again he makes absolutely amazing saves like the reaction save from the nearly Gerrard own goal header in the last few minutes of the game (I don't know what the fuck Gerrard was doing). So, once he begin to find consistency, I think we have a very good Liverpool keeper in the making.

I did say that life was probably harder at that time but my comment was referring to; the fewer rules that people had to live by (simpler), the architecture lacking glass sky-scrapers - which I dislike very much - and the dress style of the men.

I hope you don't think my last sentence was referring to me being alive during the time the film was shot. It was referring to me growing up in a London that lacked the sky-scrapers, when we had fewer rules to live by and when London had more character to it than the way I think it's going (even though it was a bit more visibly dirtier).

true,oatsalot,eu,UnitedWeStand,"It's an interesting article, worth a read. Some pretty suspicious transactions going on, but some of it does look like the money was genuinely for equipment and infrastructure for the schools.

For those of you on mobiles, here are the basics:

&gt; 'Since 2010 more than 3,444 schools – including more than half of secondary schools – have taken on academy or free school status'

&gt; 'Before July 2010, the Charities Commission oversaw the governance of academies, but this was switched to the DfE in August 2011.'

&gt; Shadow Schools Minister, Kevin Brennan - ""David Cameron has failed to put in place the appropriate checks over academy chain funding decisions, prioritising pace of expansion over the protection of public money and school standards,"" Brennan said. ""It is deeply concerning that so much taxpayer money is ending up in the pockets of academy chain directors and trustees.""

..and some of the more controversial parts:

&gt; 'Leigh Academies Trust, run by Michael Gove's newly appointed schools commissioner, Frank Green, has paid £111,469 since 2010 to Shoreline, a private company founded by him, in consultancy fees.'

&gt; 'Grace Academy, which runs three schools in the Midlands and was set up by the Tory donor Lord Edmiston, has paid more than £1m either directly to or through companies owned or controlled by Edmiston, trustees' relatives and to members of the board of trustees.'

&gt; 'Payments include £533,789 to International Motors Limited, a company owned by Edmiston, and £4,253 to Subaru UK Ltd, where he is the ultimate controlling party. More than £173,000 was also paid to the charities Grace Foundation and Christian Vision, both of which were set up by Edmiston. In addition, £108,816 has been paid to a company controlled by the son-in-law of one trustee.'

&gt; 'Grace Academy also employs Gary Spicer, the brother of Lady Edmiston, as its executive director, on a salary of £30,000 plus pension. Spicer's own company received more than £367,732 from Grace Academy over the last six years for consultancy work.'

&gt; 'Aurora Academies Trust has paid £213,015 to Mosaica Education for educational services, reimbursement of travel expenses and for use of the Paragon curriculum resource.

true,darksurfer,null,null,"sure, excess demand over supply is a necessary component of increased prices. however, the main driver in the case of UK house prices is lower interest rates.

lower interest rates mean that people can *afford* to borrow more money to pay for their house and that drives prices upwards. 

it all makes sense once you understand that money in the UK is *created* through bank loans (mainly mortgages). If house prices are higher, more money needs to be borrowed/created which means more money in the economy, which means economic growth.

house prices going down would be great for people who are renting and want to buy  but utterly disastrous for the economy. 

houses are the assets underlying the balance sheets of the banks. if house prices fall the banks (still nationalised!!!) will not have sufficient capital reserve ratio to lend (create) more money and the economy will stagnate.

hence ""help to buy"" has *nothing* to do with helping struggling people get on the housing ladder and *everything* to do with maintaining house prices and encouraging people to create new money by taking out mortgages.

I don't really think Jose does that, or at least, no more than any other coach. He's rotated relentlessly and hasn't hesitated to bench someone if he feels the aren't doing well enough. He even benched Hazard for pissing him off that one time and he's the best player on the team.

Michael Gove misled the House of Commons

A statement by the education secretary about King's Science Academy in Bradford misled parliament, Bradford West MP George Galloway said, and Michael Gove should now return to the Commons to amend his erroneous claims .

""Either by accident of intent Michael Gove misled parliament,"" Galloway said. ""He claims that his party's co-chair Sir Alan Lewis is receiving less revenue for the King's site than he was previously getting for it. Where's the evidence? Because I have been demanding details on this for months. He also claims that his department was directly responsible for instigating the police investigation into the alleged fraud at the school, and nothing could be further from the truth. His department sat on the evidence until a brave whistleblower stepped forward. Gove was either badly informed, which I doubt, or he was trying to hoodwink the honourable members. He must now apologise.""

Galloway has written to the education secretary, the contents of which are below.

The letter

For the urgent attention of the Secretary of State for Education, the Rt Hon Michael Gove MP

Friday 10th January 2014

Dear Secretary of State,

Could I draw your attention to two consecutive statements you made to the House of Commons last Monday (columns 16/17 in Hansard, Monday 6th January 2014) about King’s Science Academy, Bradford, both of which are, at the very least, misleading? The two statements are:

“It is important to place on the record the fact that Mr Lewis is receiving for the property [the site now leased to King’s Science Academy] an appropriately guaranteed market rent—less than he was receiving for it beforehand. It is important to stress that, and it is also important to state that as soon as my Department was made aware of allegations of themisappropriation of public money, it contacted Action Fraud and a police investigation is now ongoing as a direct result.”

On the claim that Mr Lewis and his property company Hartley Group are receiving less than they were receiving beforehand for the site on which King’s Science Academy is now based, no evidence has been presented either by the DfE or Hartley Group thus far to substantiate this. Any such evidence would have to include the gross income from the site over a preceding period of years. I would be obliged if you would now publish the gross income received for this site since it came into the ownership of Mr Lewis and Hartley Group, if you have it, so we can establish whether Mr Lewis’s claim to have been a generous benefactor of the school, as opposed to a huge beneficiary of public funds through the lease agreement, is accurate. Any such assessment must also take into account the buildings paid for with taxpayers’ money but which will be owned by Mr Lewis and Hartley Group at the end of the lease period. In the absence of this information being placed into the public domain, I believe you should withdraw this statement at the earliest opportunity.

On the claim that the police investigation was a “direct” result of the DfE referring the matter to Action Fraud, this is misleading to the point of being untrue. You and your department were apparently content to accept the police assessment, of which they were informed in September, that there should be no investigation into fraud at King’s Science Academy. You certainly didn’t challenge it. It was only when a whistleblower went to the press, forcing your Department to release the internal audit report which your department had hitherto refused to publish, and then me and other MPs taking the issue up, that the police reviewed their previous decision and decided there was a case to answer. This has now led to the arrest of the Principal of the KSA. I believe you should correct your misleading statement on this matter to parliament at the earliest opportunity.

This leads me to have to return once again to your refusal to obtain and publish the transcript of the recording of the telephone conversation had with Action Fraud on April 25th 2013 and the police report based on that conversation. In a letter to me dated Wednesday 8th January 2014, Lord Nash has now upheld Minister Timpson’s response to me, that the DfE has no intention of obtaining the transcript and report from Action Fraud and placing them in the public domain, on the frankly absurd grounds that the original report made to Action Fraud has never been questioned. As you will know, I and others have repeatedly questioned whether this report was in any way adequate. These questions are not going to go away unless and until the transcript and the report based on the conversation are published.

Continuing to refuse to do so merely adds to the suspicion that ministers and officials had neither interest nor desire in seeing a proper police investigation into the misappropriation and misuse of taxpayers’ money at this free school. I urge you yet again to reverse this decision and publish.

Yours sincerely,

George Galloway, MP for Bradford West",1,1389607210,null,0,false,0,ceod867,t3_1v3gl6,t1_ceod867,t3_1v3gl6,null,1431921400,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

In undergrad it is a lot rarer.  

Other than that Churchill College is known for a few things. It has a very good reputation in STEM subjects, that's where they have the most places by far and they strive to make them get excellent marks. They have excellent outdoor areas, having tennis courts, a cricket field and a football field on site, along with a gym. We're a bit out of the way from the centre of town because of that, do look into getting a bike (the second hand bike trade is big in Cambridge) or you will waste so much time walking places. Finally, I guess Churchill is also known for its Pav. The undergrad society (JCR) organises what is now the last weekly free student club event on College grounds, all other Colleges have either introduced an entrance fee and/or made it monthly/termly or have transported it somewhere else. If you're an undergrad, it's a good way to bond with your colleagues in your year, but as with all student-run nights it can get a bit tacky.  

Research opportunities for undergraduates really depends on the subject you're doing, most language and arts subjects will require some form of essay work, in your final undergraduate year you are expected to go out there and research the information yourself. Science subjects, not so much, although for subjects with an emphasis on practicals you will usually have to orchestrate a project of your own and do the data analysis on it, under guidance of staff.

For me living in London was about not only the Prince Charles, but also about having a choice of *other* cinemas foreign showing subtitled movies, too - a choice of them showing in the west end on any given day of the week.

For me it's about being able to go to Covent Garden and the cool little shops in Chelsea and Fulham, the pubs by the river. A wider range of food, restaurants and take-aways, the largest comic and music stores. 

Really, it's been so long since I lived there that I can't enumerate all the joys of living in London. And it can be really shitty, too, but Reckless Records have multiple branches of second hand record shops, which was really important and cool to me when I lived there in the 90s, the era of the CD. Now I'd probably find something else to amaze me.

I certainly *did* enjoy all London had to offer - I didn't move there under some illusion, in fact I had few preconceptions, and it turned out to be much different from what I expected, but cool and fun and fulfilling.

Other places have some of these things, but not all of them, not all together in one place.

Say it will take around 5 years to move into the new stadium - that's a relatively short period of time to ensure that the club is in a prime position to attract crowds, sustain a Premier League place and not haemorrhage too much money. All the while it also needs to satisfy TF's commercial agenda. You can't just throw money at players, you also need common sense.

Contrast this to Brentford down the road. On paper - while Warren Farm still hasn't kicked off and Old Oak Common is still in its planning infancy - they could be in a position to pull equal to QPR. Their new stadium will be bigger than Loftus Road, and almost certainly more comfortable.

On the one hand, large multinationals or big supermarket chains are praised as being job creators and valuable to the economy, when it seems like really all they do is suck huge amounts of money out of local areas and lead to deprivation, because money stops circulating and wages are driven down.  And nobody ever seems to stop to mention that these badly paid jobs are shit, demeaning and depressing and no fucking wonder nobody would want to do them in the first place.  And if people don't want to take these shit jobs, and spend their lives in misery, then we label them scroungers and try to take away their dignity.  Never once stopping to question if maybe this is really the best way to be running things.

Then there's the fact that we're totally happy with reaping the benefits of extremely cheap (borderline slave in some places, it seems) labour, so that we can buy cheap clothes at primark and get a new smartphone every 2 years for barely anything above cost price, but as soon as similar market forces come into play here we want to keep the damned immigrants out.  So we're quite happy to foist unbridled global capitalism onto other people, but less happy when we start to feel it's effects at home.

It probably all boils down to the fact that it's a very easy way to view the world.  Big companies are good, making us money and jobs and coffee and televisions.

true,pharao007,null,null,"You should also add moving companies from UK to overseas (to cut costs by having a foreign employee in a foreign country - mostly in third world where everything is very cheap) as well as buying goods produced in those countries.

At the end of the day people on general are selfish. When faced with buying UK and Spanish strawberries, they will most likely choose the ones which are cheap (if the taste is the same). Even if UK strawberries were to taste better, there is only a certain amount more when a person in UK would pay for it (I doubt someone will pay twice just for the little better tasting thing and the fact of its origin country).

The same with migration. In 2004 UK had pretty low unemployment. Cheap labour was required as if unemployment were to reach a very very low level, there would be most likely shortages in fulfilling of jobs. Immigrants came, filled jobs, all was fine.... until world crisis started and unemployment rose. Now UK doesn't want any longer immigrants and although it's a free market and nobody can force you to employ an immigrant, employers still prefer them because of number of reasons. Then the locals say immigrants undercut wages - which wouldn't be a case if unemployment was lower.

Migration of cultures, not blending into society etc are far less important points. Otherwise Britain would have stopped immigration years ago. It is all about money and also local's attitudes. Some will complain they are undercut, or that an immigrant took his job - very often not looking at the fact that he is lazy or wants too much money.

Also, as Britain is generally a rich country, means certain production in UK simply can't have higher costs (thus requirement for ""cheaper"" immigrants who work without complaining). If UK was to suddenly cut all ""cheap"" immigrants who do jobs most of them want it would be a choice of ""paying twice for UK strawberries"", ""not importing foreign strawberries at all (people forced to buy UK's ones)"" or ""not having strawberries produced in UK"". The same thing was with Thatcher closing mines in UK. It was cheaper to import so unless people were to pay more for locally mined coal, they would either had to close local mines or pay from the government extra - thus closure was sought and achieved.",0,1389614136,null,0,false,0,ceoe6un,t3_1v3ncs,t1_ceoe6un,t3_1v3ncs,null,1431921848,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

We approached 11 different bank in the UK and every time we have got a similar answer that unfortunately they can't work with Bitcoin businesses.

But finally, we managed to find a bank here, who is completely aware of what we are doing and doesn't have anything against it as long as we provide reasonable AML/KYC. Our business is B2B-oriented so it is a bit easier to verify merchants than to do so with personal accounts.

If that sounds risky — we have a backup banking partner outside that UK who loves Bitcoin business. So in the unlikely event our British bank will crack our operations down — we will keep serving UK businesses no matter what. 

I don't think that working with Cryptopay will impose any actions from banks as our payments are sent according to a legal agreement between the parties involved and all necessary AML/KYC check have been done.

Extremely. It's one of the best universities in the world. It regularly competes with Harvard and MIT for the top spot.

In which context? Churchill is quite a STEM subject focused college, with around 70% of the college doing sciencey subjects.

You can try sending an email to one of [these](http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/visitors/contact/) contacts. Try the admissions officer. Include in your email that you're not sure about exactly who the best person to get in contact with would be - they're usually very happy to help.

The water that gets used for fracking ends up very heavily contaminated, so even if it isn't drawn from the drinking supply, it still presents a huge amount of waste that has to be managed. Since Britain's water is very tightly managed, it seems pretty unlikely that fracking won't actually take from our municipal supply, but perhaps it's actually not that much of a concern. The waste management absolutely is though.

Your second paragraph backs my point that a chunk of wealth is very likely to end up being funnelled out of the country if we go ahead. If the US is the country that has the expertise, then the US is where a chunk of the profits are going to end up. 

Just as a reminder, the question I am actually answering is 'why are people so against fracking'. I'm not going to really put much effort into arguing about whether they are right or not - it's a heavily nuanced situation. My own personal opinion is that I'd rather save the shale oil until post 2030, and that by then I may actually be pro-fracking. 

I do hope though that I have been able to answer /u/TrolleyPower 's question to your satisfaction, and shown you why people don't think that fracking is a good idea.

true,faithle55,null,null,"There are three persons who were apprehended or perhaps only suspected in an attempt to burgle somewhere else in the resort some weeks earlier. The chalet/apartment was occupied by one or more children at the time and the burglars were scared off; when the parents arrived back (lots of possibly negligent parenting going on in this resort, one might think) the burglars have fled.

The somewhat mind-boggling theory is that they then attempted to burgle the McCann's apartment on the night in question. Not having learnt their earlier lesson, they were alarmed to find Madeleine in the apartment and then - and here is the astonishing part of the theory - instead of just running away and thereby never coming to the attention of the police again, they decide to kidnap the child and run away with her.

This theory is so full of holes that I am embarrassed that an English police detective gives it more than 15 seconds of credibility. Burglars are typically surreptitious criminals; the last thing they are going to do is risk being surprised in possession of a little girl. If Madeleine was asleep when they were in the apartment, why risk waking her up? If she was awake, why risk her wriggling, struggling and calling out once they are outside the apartment? 

This theory that there are people out there just waiting to buy blonde-haired blue-eyed girl-children (or boy children, for that matter) is complete rubbish. There is no evidence - so far as I am aware - that any other child has gone missing in similar circumstances in any Mediterranean resort whatsoever in the years since Madeleine disappeared. Nor in fact in the ten years before. There is some evidence of a market in children among abusive men in Belgium but nothing similar to the theory put forward by McCann sympathisers. 

So what advantage do the burglars gain by taking the little girl? They can't sell her, and the additional danger of getting caught and the far greater punishment if they are caught make the whole suggestion ridiculous.

I simply do not understand, given everything we know in the UK about the things children suffer at the hands of their parents - neglect or deliberate abuse, and worse - why the parents' version of events continues to be taken at face value.

So your comment about expecting a certain type of behaviour from Eastern European people could be construed as racist. In that you are reinforcing cultural stereotypes.

It would be just as easy for me to say that the English are racist because of all the issues there's been in the past, i.e. throwing bananas onto the pitch (John Barnes and various other black players), monkey chants and gestures (a la the Stoke fan there and various other fans). I'm using England as an example as they clearly have big problems with racism.

Do you see what I've done? I'm labelling a country, or a region as racist because of the actions of certain individuals. When you say ""I expect this sort of behaviour from Eastern Europe"" it's that exact stereotyping and tarring people with the same brush that Corky83 has an issue with.

If you substituted ""Eastern Europe"" with America, Nigeria, Australia, or simply said you'd expect that behaviour if he was black, you are still labelling a culture, a nation or an ethnicity based on stereotypes and particular behaviour of individuals. Which really is racist in it's basic form.

Just because you've been fighting racism doesn't mean you cannot be racist. It's your personal perception of what's acceptable.

Removing it and apologising for it isn't the same as not thinking it. You used an example which you felt was correct, but in doing so you labelled a whole culture of people.

&gt;Researchers believe the increased presence of metals could be due to a variety of factors including: industrial accidents such as faulty gas well casings; mechanical vibrations from natural gas drilling activity disturbing particles in neglected water well equipment; or the lowering of water tables through drought or the removal of water used for the hydraulic fracturing process.  Any of these scenarios could release dangerous compounds into shallow groundwater. 

Or in the words of the abstract in your link:

&gt;the spatial patterns in our data suggest that elevated constituent levels could be due to a variety of factors including mobilization of natural constituents, hydrogeochemical changes from lowering of the water table, or industrial accidents such as faulty gas well casings.

It says that fracking causing unmaintained private water wells to leak rust into the water table is one possible cause, not the definitive cause so I don't know what caused you to draw that conclusion.

&gt;Furthermore this study as well as one by Duke, supports the idea that in most areas where shale gas is present, hydrocarbon analouges are present within the water table anyway, and were there even before fracking commenced.

The University of Texas study is comparing the situation now compared to 1989-1999, prior to the proliferation of natural gas drilling.

We only offer house cleaning, we do not offer office/commercial work - that enables us to refine our techniques and stay true to our ethos of offering people a better quality clean.

We have an extensive checklist which the customer can see on our website before they book the clean - that is our 'contract' so to speak - if we perform every task on that list, we have fulfilled our end of the bargain - we then check (before leaving the house) with the customer that they are happy with the job we have performed - if they are, then great, job done. If they aren't, we merrily address the issues until the list is completed (in the eyes of the customer).

These techniques will help us minimise the number of people who end up booking us in order to receive a free clean. (Some people are horrible and might try and take us for a ride, but we believe humanity as a whole are pretty fair, and the majority of people won't do that.)

Our website is www.TidyandShiny.com - check it out, the our services page (http://www.tidyandshiny.com/services-and-pricing/), it shows you the checklist of tasks we promise to complete before we leave your house ",0,1389618694,null,0,false,0,ceoeyc4,t3_1v23sy,t1_ceoeyc4,t1_ceo4y61,null,1431922209,1,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,1
