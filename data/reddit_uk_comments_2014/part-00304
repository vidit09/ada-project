Re: the reasons supermarkets throw food away, it's not always it's out of date or about to go bad. I watched a fascinating documentary lastnight called Wasted/ Wanted about Fareshare South West, and food can be thrown out purely because bar codes don't match up with what was expected, quantities are out, recipes have changed, etc. Bear in mind supermarkets have to adhere to quite strict rules, some of which are entirely based on bureaucracy and paperwork rather than the actual safety of the food.

Also, I work for The Big Issue and I asked them if it was okay for our vendors to go in there to get food or if it might be seen as taking advantage but they said there's no such thing as taking advantage, they just want the food that would have otherwise been wasted to be eaten.

The reason that so few people pay inheritance tax is outline in the 3rd paragraph of the document you linked:

&gt;From the late 1990s there was a steady growth in receipts from inheritance tax and the numbers of estates liable to pay it, strongly linked with the growth in house prices....

&gt;By the middle years of the decade commentators were predicting that very many more families would have to make provision to pay for the tax in future...

&gt;In 2007 the Labour Government responded to these concerns by introducing a new transferable allowance for spouses and civil partners. 

This is exactly what I said in my original post, older people giving away money to  family to avoid paying tax on it.

&gt;Yeah the government would only spend it on stupid things like pensions and hospitals, much better I avoid that to make sure my grandson gets any money after the first £350,000 lump sum tax free.

If you have been saving money all your life for the specific reason of passing it onto your children when you die, why should you not be able to do so? As I have just said, the government even makes it extremely easy to do so, assuming you are happy to take a cut in living standards. 

&gt;Bollocks they're still getting the first £350,000 tax free. Even if you assume the departed had seven recipients they're still getting a handout of £50,000. It's hardly a terrible burden on anyone.

I think that it just comes down to what you think is reasonable for people to expect. You might think that people should be grateful for being allowed to pass on £50,000 to their children after they die. Many people would feel it is their right to pass on much more. As much as they can, and that the government t has no right to take a massive cut from it just because a person has died. 

Once you have paid tax on your earnings, should that money not be for you do do with as you wish? And if you want to pass it onto your children, why should anyone else get a cut, no matter how much it is? 

Obviously if you make this a poor vs middle class and rich debate, those with a bit more to pass on will always end up looking greedy and selfish. But with rising house prices they are fast becoming a sizable group.

Is it a debate for the parties to argue why you should vote for them, or is it a debate between the leaders arguing why they should be prime minister? Last time around, it was Brown, Cameron and Clegg. Barring the possibility of a leadership change in the parties, it was a certainty that one of those three men would be prime minister after the election (with the surge in popularity of the lib dems suggesting Clegg had a chance of it). Therefore, I think it was the right thing to do to exclude the smaller parties because none of them would be in government and their leaders couldn't be compared to the leaders of the big three. Coupling those debates with regional debates in Scotland, Wales and (I think) NI that included regional parties seemed a fair settlement to me.

This time around things are different though, UKIP have become far more popular but I don't think Farage sees himself as a contender to be Prime Minister. Lib dems are looking like they'll be cut down but we don't know that for sure and it's too soon to exclude them. There is a chance that the SNP will increase their number of MPs and are currently the third largest party by membership.

I think a line has to be drawn somewhere. If you only allow parties that are truly national parties and contest seats everywhere in the UK, you're left with the conservative party, UKIP and a few very small parties. If the purpose of the debate is to discuss governance of the UK and policies that should be pursued, then there isn't much sense including the SNP or Plaid Cymru as they have no desire to govern the UK and therefore have no policies of their own to bring to the table, all they'd do is be critical of all the other parties. I don't see the problem with only including the SNP in a Scottish debate since nobody outside of scotland could possibly vote for them.

Greens are a tricky issue, who would they send? There is the green party of england and wales, the scottish green party and the northern irish green party. They're all on good terms with eachother but they're also separate parties. Would all three be represented or would they have to agree on one person to speak for all three?

As far as I know loss of income tax through low paid and part time work has been a highlighted issue started in Blair's era and carried on through successive governments since.  Unfortunately this has been massively compounded by the current government with its huge drive to get unemployment figures down at any cost.

It probably is more complicated - however I think that most people will understand that if less people pay income tax  less goes into the system.  If people have less to spend, vat and fuel and all the other taxes are reduced.

The [Lloyds Avios](http://www.avios.com/gb/en_gb/collect/lloydsbank/lloyds-avios-rewards-credit-card-account) card has no FX fees and you'll earn 1.25 Avios/£ when you use the Amex card it comes with. Admittedly you'll need to fly BA (or AA/US) to take advantage of the Avios, but sounds like you've got a presence in the UK you'll want to get back to, and you'll get great value on GCM-NAS, GCM-MIA and GCM-CLT (and any flight connections thereafter). You'll get a flight upgrade voucher as well after you spend £7k annually, but NB that it's only for a single person, so less useful if you're travelling as a couple. £24 annual fee, but you can offset that with [£20 Quidco](http://www.quidco.com/lloyds-bank-avios-rewards-credit-card/) or [£25 TopCashBack](http://www.topcashback.co.uk/lloyds-bank-avios-rewards-credit-cards/). I wouldn't bother with the MasterCard it comes with because...

Card #2 is [Aqua Reward](http://www.aquacard.co.uk/credit-cards/reward-card), which is your best bet for places that don't take Amex. It's a card targeted at the subprime end of the market and has a high APR, but you don't care about that. What you care about is that it's free to use abroad and offers 0.5% cashback. This is much much better than the paltry 1.25 Avios per **£5** on the Lloyds MasterCard. The downside is that you'll probably only have a £1,200 credit limit, so you might need to pay it off mid-month (easy enough to do online these days), but hopefully you'll be able to put most of your spend through the Lloyds Amex.

Your options are better if you have a presence in the US as well. Capital One (USA) offer all(?) their cards with no FX fees, including one that pays 1.5% cashback on all purchases. They are Visa cards, so very flexible. The USA Amex Platinum card also has no FX fees and earns 1 point/USD. There's a hefty $450 annual fee, but also loads of perks that could possibly make it worth your while.",0,1413227397,null,0,false,0,cl8g6rz,t3_2j2cj0,t1_cl8g6rz,t3_2j2cj0,null,1426546601,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3

We need to encourage larger countries like America and China to reduce their effects on the climate, otherwise our own efforts are near pointless.

One thing that seems quite hypocritical on this subreddit is people saying that cutting the $3 Billion we get from inheritance tax is massively important for our economy, but the $8 Billion we spend on the EU each year is pretty much nothing. Not really taking any side on this issue, just something I happened to notice. 

I think we should ensure our aid is actually helping people rather than just going to corrupt governments who waste it or countries with space programs (though aid to India is planned to stop in 2015). We should put the main focus on developing ourselves as well. 

I disagree with them on the ECHR, but this could change depending on what a British bill of rights looks like. 

I disagree with them on the Armed Forces thing.

I also think businesses should have the freedom to hire who they want. 

My favourite policies of theirs are probably more Direct democracy (like Switzerland), Grammar schools, the ability to take an apprenticeship instead of four non-compulsory GCSEs, controlled immigration, and less regulations overall. I'm swinging between the Tories and UKIP at the minute. I won't vote for UKIP unless they develop their policies a lot more as they still seem to be a party under construction.

They succeeded in painting huge cuts in public spending as the only way out. I;d say all we've done is pump credit back into the same financial and service-based economy that collapsed in 2008. And lo and behold, the same institutions which judged economic prosperity then judge the UK as one of the more successful countries now.

Edinburgh: always there or there abouts, returning player(s), history of dominance, probably a foreign import or three to bolster ranks

Heriot-Watt: young team, only one (*) graduate loss to my knowledge, momentum with them from successful season last year

Glasgow: they train indoors a lot, though chance for good finish hinge rather a lot on one or two players, including Indoor National MVP from last year

St Andrews: no (?) graduates from last year, experienced pick up in form of Ireland u20 captain, training a lot. Seem to play 2-1-2 ISO exclusively but works against poorer defences. 

Aberdeen: core played over summer on NEO, slightly top heavy but two or three players can take an indoor team a long way. Limbsiest player in tournament doesn't hurt indoors either. 

Strathclyde: couple notable losses to team patched up with a pick up or two. can't really say I know all that much.

Stirling: small team will rely on two or three players playing well the entire weekend to make nationals. can usually grit out a win when required indoors.

The raods built in America, wre partly financed by WW2 loans, so that maybe an in-accurate analogy.
However, it does not work the same way for China.

If other countries can do it and HAVE done it, then why can;t they?

Roads are not the only thing that brings commerce.
There were many cobbled streets in england that did not increase the flow of traffic or commerce. the same way as farmers tracks worked.

Horse and cart built the main trading posts in london. and trade was already esptablished before the Roman empire.

It plain and simple. they don;t have the mentality to help themselves.

If there were no roads and business in England right now, the first thing we would do is make farms and roads.

I don't want to hear about the cost. if we had to go back to using our hands to dig roads, that's what we would have to do.
Unlikely in this day and age, but it is true.

It only peaked there because the measure was introduced. If it had not been it would have continued to rise.

&gt;By the middle years of the decade commentators were predicting that very many more families would have to make provision to pay for the tax in future...

What I am saying is that old people giving away money that they should really be keeping for themselves is what is preventing them from having to pay the inheritance tax. 

&gt;As an aside I have never met anyone who has saved money all their life to provide for their children. Literally no one.

Most people buy a house under the assumption that it will be an asset they can pass on to their children or family once they die. Obviously it is not the only reason they buy a house, but it is a consideration. 

&gt;No one is stopping anyone from passing on money to their children. The government is merely redistributing some of that wealth. Quite a small amount as it happens.

The government has already redistributed the wealth in the form of income tax. It is a tax on already taxed income. 

&gt;One is literally profiting at the expense of the other, how can it not be a poor vs rich debate?

If i choose not to give all my monthly income to the poor, am a profiting at the expense of the poor? 

Like I said, the money has already been taxed by the government, that tax should go towards helping the poor.

There are many millions in the UK who have absolutely no financial prospect of ever buying property, and millions also who do not want to. There are also a boatload of people who want to live in an area they can't afford to buy in!

You are ultimately right in that prices are higher because BTL investors exist buying property, but your argument is simplistic. There is an equilibrium at play here: 
If too many property in an area get bought to rent, the local rental price drops which in turn makes the property less valuable to BTL investors and so more affordable for FTB's. 
Similarly, if all the property are bought to live in, the rental price in the area goes up making the property more valuable to a BTL investor and so less affordable for FTB's.

As I said a lot of people want to rent, for many reasons. By prohibiting the operation of BTL investing, you will distort the market by artificially limiting the supply of rental property, and this will make renting more expensive vs property purchase. 

This will primarily hit the likes of students/poor people. The middle class will have less money too though, because as a country we basically borrow against our house value to buy flash shit!

They are always punching above their weight, and sometimes they come so close to success it hurts. 
When I was beginning to notice what an amazing game football is (2010) there was a team that popped up every now and then that I had noticed that seemed to fit that profile. That team of course was Spurs. And then it just so happened my two best friends started to root for Tottenham because they liked the style of play. But with them, I got more into it, and I just naturally fell in love with the team, because they're the type of team that I have always rooted for.

There are various possible solutions aside from hydro, including compressed air and using the wind energy to pump water underground to take advantage of geothermal energy. The solution will probably be a combination of all of the above - store excess wind by pumping air underground where it's stored at high pressure to then bring up pressurised heated water when needed. Something along those lines wouldn't need a big hydro dam. There are definitely engineering solutions to storing wind energy that're easier than dealing with nuclear waste.

false,Carlswaen,null,null,"&gt;In 1997 we had one of the worse systems on the planet.

Hardly.  That's 24ct revisionism right there.

&gt;The introduction of the bureaucracy helped dramatically. Doctors are a fuck tonne more expensive than managers. 

Largely unnecessary bureaucrats now out number clinicians in the NHS.  Under Labour management positions increased by 58%.  It's jobs for the boys, and many of them are paid more than doctors.

England now has the lowest number of practising doctors per person of all developed countries, but we're swimming in managers to manage them.
    
&gt;The doctor costs more and should delegate that task to a nice and cheap bureaucrat so they can focus on health care.

Clueless.   The doctor knows what has to be done and understands the demands on the system and the inefficiencies inherent in the system.  The bureaucrat does not.  The doctor knows what other doctors, nurses, and the system needs and has lived with the waste.  

&gt;The only reason this is a debate is because a load of the public live in a bizarro world where managers always earn more than the people they are managing. This is not true in any skilled field.

THe upper management is incredibly well paid.   

If only doctors who were more in charge had some form of less qualified, less paid underling but still clinically trained to help in day to day running.  Somebody to *nurse* the system along and run wards.

They're not talking about who runs the cafeteria, for Chris'sakes,  they're talking about the top bands  where they're on £70-100k.


To implement these bureaucratic changes we have so called 'super managers', around 400 of them, and they're on £250k each.   We don't need super managers or VSMs.  We need semi-retired, much more qualified clinicians passing on their expertise, for much less, because they are invested emotionally into delivering a better NHS - and not because you bought a ticket on the latest gravy train.

THE GATS: A THREAT TO SOVEREIGNTY, 
DEVELOPMENT, AND SOCIETY 

While supporters of the agreement characterize criticisms of it as exaggerated 
and exploited by the anti-globalization movement, it is not only activists 
and radicals who ﬁ nd fault with the agreement. An array of non-govern- 
mental organizations, academics, and research institutes are also concerned 
about the GATS’ impact on service regulation. While they acknowledge 
many of the arguments made in defense of the GATS, these groups point 
out that such arguments require qualiﬁ cation. They assert both that the 
agreement is not as ﬂ exible and development friendly as advertised, and 
that it may not actually exclude social services as claimed. 

In terms of general obligations, while members may maintain measures 
which derogate from MFN treatment, those measures must be: (1) listed 
in, and meet the conditions of, the annex on article II exceptions; and (2) 
identiﬁ ed at either the entry into force of, or accession to, the agreement. 
The majority of the members of the WTO self-identify as either develop- 
ing or least developed. As such they are particularly disadvantaged by the 
requirement for a pre-determined list of exceptions because it “demands 
a level of foresight and capacity unavailable … not least as it requires an 
awareness of both current and future regulations” (GATSWatch 2002). 
Furthermore, the CTS reviews MFN-inconsistent measures if they are 
maintained for more than ﬁ ve years. The agreement states that “in prin- 
ciple, such exemptions should not exceed a period of [ten] years … [and] 
shall be subject to negotiation in subsequent trade liberalizing rounds” 
(WTO 1994a, 305). 


While members may also introduce MFN exceptions via a waiver, the 
ministerial conference determines the appropriateness of such a measure, 
and may decline waiver requests. Again, as requests for waivers or exten- 
sions are human resource-intensive and require administrative capacity, 
less developed members may face challenges in this process as well. Finally, 
when waivers are granted, the ministerial conference decides the terms, 
conditions, and date of termination. They also become subject to annual 
review, whereby the conference decides whether the exceptions will be 
maintained, modiﬁ ed, or terminated. 


The ability of members to modify, suspend, or withdraw speciﬁ c com- 
mitments is similarly restricted. For example, members may not utilize 
article XXI (Modiﬁ cation of Schedules) until three years from the date 
on which the commitment in question entered into force, and they must 
inform the CTS of a change at least three months before its implementa- 
tion.6 In addition, the agreement authorizes the CTS to develop further 
procedures for the rectiﬁ cation or modiﬁ cation of schedules, whereby “any 
[m]ember which has modiﬁ ed or withdrawn scheduled commitments 
under this article shall modify its schedule according to such procedures” 
(WTO 1994a, 300). Thus the CTS may deny or change modiﬁ cations 
made using this provision in accordance with such developments. 


What is more, if a proposed measure is expected to adversely affect 
another member’s beneﬁ ts, even if not in violation of the GATS, this af- 
fected member may be either entitled to compensation or authorized to 
suspend concessions or other obligations affecting the modifying member’s 
service providers. If the members involved cannot reach agreement on an 
appropriate compensatory adjustment,7 which the modifying member 
provides voluntarily to all affected members on a MFN basis, the affected 
member may seek recourse via arbitration. If successful, it would have 
permission to suspend obligations or concessions beneﬁ ting the modify- 
ing member. Again, the limited negotiating and legal capacity of many 
developing countries may result in their not being as well served in this 
process as other members. Meanwhile, having to supply compensation or 6
being denied concessions is likely to have a greater economic impact on 
developing members. 


Central to defensive claims about the impact of the GATS on the 
regulation of social services is the argument that article I:3 excludes such 
services from coverage. Critics qualify this statement, however, by noting 
that few social services are provided exclusively by governments, with 
most involving at least some commercial or competitive component. It 
is thus unclear “how far this article goes to protect the grey areas relating 
to a public service” (Status of Women Canada 2004, 12); much depends 
on how understandings of “commercial” and “competition” are applied. 
While many may hold opinions regarding the meaning of article I:3, the 
actual interpretation will only become clear once a social service trade 
dispute is brought to a WTO tribunal. 


If commercial is interpreted narrowly, social services that have user fees, 
for example, would be subject to the general obligations of the agreement, 
even if the fees are below competitive market rates. Likewise, the Dispute 
Settlement Body (DSB) of the WTO may construe a situation in which 
government and private enterprise simultaneously provide social services, 
although at higher rates, as constituting competition. Thus, if the DSB 
interprets either of these terms narrowly, it could hold the provision of 
social services to MFN treatment and all other general obligations and 
disciplines, including article VI on domestic regulation.8 


Negotiators included article VI in the agreement in response to concerns 
that the GATS did not sufﬁ ciently address hidden forms of protectionism 
concealed in domestic regulations. They intended it to ensure that quali- 
ﬁ cation requirements and procedures, technical standards, and licensing 
requirements do not constitute unnecessary barriers to services trade. The 
article authorizes the CTS to develop additional disciplines to ensure that 
these requirements are, inter alia, “based on objective and transparent 
criteria” and “not more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality 
of the service” so as not to unduly restrict trade (1994a, 290). Paragraph 
four outlines this task in terms of general commitments, and paragraph 
ﬁ ve in terms of speciﬁ c commitments.

.....

It is important to note that article VI is meant to discipline measures 
that do not violate GATS provisions but which nonetheless distort com- 
petition and restrict access to domestic markets. As the WTO explains, 
“trade barriers may not only result from measures falling under the market 
access and national treatment provisions of GATS, but from a variety of 
factors, including licensing and qualiﬁ cation requirements, and technical 
standards in pursuit of legitimate national policy objectives. Such objec-
tives, of course, will not be the subject of multilateral negotiations” (2003, 
140). Deciding whether a measure represents an unnecessary barrier to 
trade in services, however, requires the application of a necessity test—es- 
sentially, a weighing of the means against the end. Judging whether a given 
measure constitutes an unnecessary barrier to trade in services unavoidably 
involves subjective interpretation of the terms of the provision. How article 
VI affects regulatory sovereignty depends upon future understandings of 
key ambiguities in the provision. It is yet unclear which criteria the DSB 
will consider objective and transparent, or how it will measure quality, 
for example. 

To date, the WTO’s approach to article VI has been sector speciﬁ c, 
with necessity tests reﬂ ecting the differences between service sectors and 
accompanying regulations. However, there are some critics who consider 
this inadequate and advocate the application of a horizontal discipline, 
which would apply the same criteria and considerations to all service 
sectors in an undifferentiated way. Because article II:2 of the Agreement 
on Technical Barriers to Trade is also intended to discipline non-viola- 
tion measures, the Working Party on Domestic Regulation has focused 
on whether or not its necessity test, which has a pilot application in the 
Accountancy Disciplines, could serve as a model in the development of 
broadly applicable disciplines to govern domestic regulation within the 
GATS.9 However, there is concern that extending these disciplines to other 
services, and social services in particular, will “undermine governments’ 
ability to set their own standards [and] professional codes of conduct, and 
protect consumers” (Chanda 2003, 2003). 


The implications of the GATS for regulatory sovereignty would mat- 
ter less if the effects of service trade liberalization were guaranteed and 
straightforward. Opponents note, however, that there is a lack of data, 
particularly statistical data, to justify the extrapolation of the beneﬁ ts of 
merchandise trade liberalization to services. Even the WTO acknowledges 
this fact, noting that “there are few good empirical studies of the gains 
from liberalization of trade in services” (2003, 146). 


Many further criticize the extension of the GATT framework to the 
service trade on the basis that it is conceptually ill-suited to deal with 
the complexities and particularities of services. Although not discussed 
here, many speciﬁ c issues associated with trade in services complicate the 
application of core principles of the multilateral trading system (Footer 
2002). These issues are reﬂ ected in the paucity of commitments made 
at the Uruguay round, where it “became apparent that services would 
not be easily integrated into a structure designed for goods” (Djordevic 
2002, 306). 


The claim is not that there are no potential beneﬁ ts from service trade 
liberalization, but rather that not enough is known about them. Opponents 
note that claims regarding the extensive beneﬁ ts of service liberalization 
rest on very limited evidence which is partial, anecdotal, and produced 
mainly by developed countries. For example, “there is no evidence to date 
that the greater certainty associated with GATS commitments has any 
signiﬁ cant effect on increasing investment” and that “other factors, such 
as the size of the market, social, political and macroeconomic stability are 
at least as important” (UK Partnership for Global Health 2003, 24). In 
questioning the beneﬁ ts of service trade liberalization, GATS critics look 
beyond the example of the SAPs and the developing world. Returning 
again to the example of health care, many studies have demonstrated that 
the United States consistently spends more on health care than any other 
country (without providing any additional services) but scores lower than 
the OECD median in most measures of health service use resulting from 
highly priced health care (Anderson et al. 2003, 90). Economic consider- 
ations cause many Americans to avoid seeking health care until treatment 
becomes more urgent, resulting in health outcomes lower than in some 
developing nations. Peter Julian of the Council of Canadians suggests 
that “virtually every credible study ever done has shown that private, for 
proﬁ t health care is more expensive, less efﬁ cient, and of lower quality than 
public” (The Corner House 2001, 25). Some GATS critics predict that 
liberalizing any social service will be similarly costly (negatively impacting 
equity), inefﬁ cient, and ineffective. 

ASSESSMENT OF THE DEBATE 

A closer look at the debate reveals that while some of those opposed to 
the GATS are certainly guilty of making exaggerated claims about the 
impacts of the agreement, advocates of the agreement have omitted key 
details when clarifying its provisions. **Moreover, it seems that concerns 
about the effect of the GATS on regulatory sovereignty over social services 
are neither invented nor completely implausible, but result from a lack 
of unambiguous information on which to base a judgment. Indeed, the 
debate exists because there is room for both sides to interpret the text differ- 
ently, reaching opposite conclusions regarding what rights and obligations 
members have assumed under it.** As Yeates aptly notes, “the existence of 
multilateral rules neither guarantees a common understanding of them 
nor precludes a ‘ﬂ exible’ interpretation” (2005, 21).

intangible and particular nature of services, ambiguous criteria, the com-

You're clearly very lucky, in fact you're the first person I've ever heard of this happening to. Obviously I'm not speaking for the entire private sector - just my experience of it. I also think it is relevant to the argument - It's a big problem when right wing politicians demonise public sector workers as they are seen to have ""better"" pay deals off the back of taxation drawn from the private sector.

&gt;If you aren't getting regular increases to match inflation, then you are getting regular pay cuts and your employer is telling you they don't think you're worth shit. The economy grows and leaves you behind, your purchasing power dwindling to nothing.

This is sad but it's true and it's how the world works. Some years you get a pay increase some years you don't. It should have be flexible and to do with the quality of work you produce rather than across the board imo.

&gt; When John Prescott called Chuka Umunna ""chumbawumba"" people here made excuses for it

I was aware the comment was made, I am not sure of the context so I can't comment really. 

&gt; Because a dispropotianite amount of publicity on UKIP is negative, and no, this isn't because UKIP is somehow ""worse"" than other parties.

Whether it is because they are worse or not is debatable.

&gt; Even today, there's still a lot of baseless hatred from the media towards UKIP (this article comparing them to the Nazis for example), but I think they've mostly learned their lesson from the EU elections that it doesn't really damage UKIP so much as enhance it's ""Underdog"" status.

I only glanced at the article, but the comparison stands. In the bit I read it explicitly stated that they didn't think it would lead to concentration camps.

But Hitler was more than just that, he did fill a niche in a depressive time, and you can't deny Farage does that

By all medical definitions Batman is crazy as hell. And it's not definitive that the Joker was the result of the redhood job considering his story is changed regularly, that's part of his charm is that he is truly a mystery. Batman knows the Flash and what harm he could potentially do and has done in the past. The difference between the Flash and the Doctor is that the Doctor could hypothetically just jump back in time and prevent Bruce Wayne from ever existing. They aren't friends and should the Doctor turn villainous he would have the ability to unravel much of the known universe considering he's capable of instant travel to any location at any time. He is an extremely dangerous opponent as a result, and he's arguably smarter than Batman on top of being able to regenerate when mortally wounded. 

And when talking about the other villains that enter earth simply looking for revenge on a hero we never truly see the civilian casualties and lives lost as a result. The only reason Batman must have for letting these Superheroes stay on earth is either the numbers of lives saved from random attacks to lives lost due to revenge killings is worth the risks, or he would be a total hypocrite. And as you stated previously, we all know Batman has a plan for every single known hero and villain in the DCU, which means obviously he is worried about these gods you listed, which means he would likely be concerned about the Doctor.

false,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;Very true. That's no reason not to try to close the ones which aren't beneficial. You have said yourself that a lot of inheritance tax is avoided, surely we should be trying to stop this?

I believe that the reason there are so many easy ways to avoid paying tax on inheritance, gifts, investments, trusts ect... Is that society in general believes that is is immoral and wrong to take from the deceased what they have rightfully earned over their lifetime, and prevent it being passed on in the way they wish. 

Its not like income tax avoidance, which is complicated an unavailable to most. Avoiding inheritance tax is possible for everyone, assuming your wealth is not tied up in property. 

I think that closing these loopholes would result in massive disapproval from the general public, and not just from those who are liable to lose out. I think that most people believe that you should be able to pass on the wealth you have amassed during your life, that you have earned and paid tax on, in whatever way you choose. 

&gt;Inheritance is one of the direct contributors to inequality. The person inheriting the money has done nothing at all to earn or deserve it, so why shouldn't the government take a cut? 

In which case why should people be allowed to pass on any inheritance at all? I understand your logic, but I personally disagree, and I believe most people in this country would disagree with you also.

false,PoachTWC,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"There are many. Google ""Government Revenue and Expenditure Scotland"", the reports are yearly. Do the adding yourself if you want to, otherwise here's my summary:

2012-13:
Scotland gives the UK £53.1Bn (9.1% revenue).
UK Government and Scottish Government spend £65.2Bn (9.3% spending).
Scotland is up £12.1Bn.

Scotland's budget deficit was 5.9% of GDP, £8.6Bn.
UK's budget deficit was 5.8% of GDP, £91.1Bn.

In 2011-12 we contributed 9.9% of revenue and got back 9.3%. UK still spent £7.4Bn more in Scotland than we gave. For us to match that spend we'd be running a deficit of 13% (£64.5 vs £56.9)

In 2010-11 we contributed 9.6% and got 9.3%. UK still spent £10.7Bn more in Scotland than we gave. For us to match that spend we'd be running a deficit of 20% (£63.8 vs £53.1)

In 2009-10, we contributed 9.4% and got 9.3%. UK still spent £14Bn more in Scotland than we gave. For us to match that spend we'd be running a deficit of 29% (£62.1 vs £48.1)

Older versions do not readily make comparisons as they don't provide a comparison between what Scotland spent and what the UK spent: it only provides figures as a percentage of Scottish and UK GDP.

So since the SNP got their majority in 2011, if we were an independent country with the exact same expenditure starting on a clean slate, we'd have a current debt of 47% of revenue. 47% in 3 years, or if we add 2009-10s we're at 76% of revenue in debt in the space of four years.

---

&gt;

&gt;The __territorial evolution of the British Empire__ is considered to have begun with the foundation of the [English colonial empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_colonial_empire) in the late 16th century. Since then, many territories around the world have been under the control of the United Kingdom or its predecessor states.

&gt;When the [Kingdom of Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain) was formed in 1707 by the union of the [Kingdom of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Scotland) with the [Kingdom of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_England), the latter country's colonial possessions passed to the new state. Similarly, when Great Britain was united with the [Kingdom of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Ireland) in 1801 to form the United Kingdom, control over its colonial possessions passed to the latter state. Collectively, these territories are referred to as the [British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire). Upon much of Ireland gaining independence in 1922 as the [Irish Free State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Free_State), the other territories of the Empire remained under the control of the United Kingdom.

&gt;From 1714 to 1837 the British throne was held by a series of kings who were also the rulers of the [German state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_the_Holy_Roman_Empire) of [Hanover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hanover). However, this was purely a personal union, with Hanover maintaining its political independence otherwise, and so it is not considered to have formed part of the British Empire.

That leaves government spot checks. Do they happen much? We could research it. My anecdotal evidence as one living in a Pakistani area, having known and spoken with many such immigrants over the years is that they simply don't earn or expect to earn anything like minimum wage until they become more established. They won't rat out their  friends. They are all in it together. 

You rarely hear of places being closed for paying below minimum. At the start of the recession, a factory (sweat shop) supplying Primark, iirc, was shut down. Workers there are just off the boat, get paid half minimum wage and don't stop working except to eat and sleep. Think 19th century or third world, right in our midst. 

Economically, all this keeps prices low for privileged indigenous minimum wage earners. Government has little incentive to enforce the law except in times of high unemployment, and even then it's a matter of degree. 

I may be wrong, but it ought to be possible to look and see how many such places are closed down. That these workers are paid below minimum is indubitable to anyone who knows and speaks with them. That's just the labour market they face. 

There's also self-employment with things like street peddling. Here minimum wage law simply doesn't apply. In these times a street pedlar will work very long hours for well below minimum wage: half would be lucky. Look for indigenous street pedlars in your nearest city centre. In mine they don't exist. 

So there is a kind of subterranean immigrant economy with wages and conditions well below the established legitimate economy. Governments often turn a blind eye. ",0,1413234991,null,0,false,0,cl8k818,t3_2j53wy,t1_cl8k818,t1_cl8jeqr,null,1426544699,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

false,LocutusOfBorges,,Liberal Democrat  | /r/LibDem,"&gt;The Greens are eating away at votes on the Left, rather than the ones Cameron wants to win next year, so including them in the debate would in theory be unhelpful to Labour and the Lib Dems. Cameron would still probably rather not debate Ukip, but if he’s going to have his appeal undermined by Nigel Farage, presumably he’d rather have Labour’s appeal similarly undermined by Natalie Bennett’s anti-austerity message.

Tactical aspect notwithstanding, this is perfectly fair. 

The Greens won a seat as a minor party, and polled higher than one of the parties in government in the last set of elections. The Lib Dems are something of a special case here, and I can see why the Greens were excluded- but there's certainly a solid case for them to be brought in. 

I'd enjoy a debate including the Greens. Five speakers would be about the sweet spot, really- at least in one of the debates.

Having the debate including Farage include the Greens as well would be a much fairer setup than's currently the case- but I do think that it's a touch absurd that the Lib Dems are being excluded from one of the debates altogether. They are, after all, the only third party with a serious chance of ending up with sufficient representation to form part of another coalition next year- they deserve to be heard.

It doesn't sound like your GM is doing anything wrong, legally; if you have a contract that states you are entitled to at least 4 hours of work a week, then I see nothing wrong with what he is doing from a legal standpoint. Yes, he's exploiting your flexibility and dependency on the hours but I find it odd that it has got to this stage.

In my opinion, you'd simply be best asking for a candid chat about your employment terms. If you feel you deserve a salaried position then ask for it, politely. Failing that, ask for a raise in your minimum hours to 30+. Highlight the dedication you've put in by working 39 hours regularly and there is really no shame in telling your employer that you are financially dependent on the hours you get in this job. If you're a valued member of a team then he will agree to it (if he's a reasonable man of course). There's no law to prevent you from asking for a contract negotiation. But to safeguard against the GM taking exception to your request and penalizing you by docking hours (which he is entitled to do), I would recommend going on a job search. Find positions you can use to leverage your GM into giving you, at the very least a guarantee of a dependable amount of hours.

It's a fairly affluent area. The [2010 results](http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/2015guide/sheffieldhallam/) were an absolute landslide- to say nothing of how pathetic Labour's share of the vote has always been in the area. The Tories would have to deal with the UKIP-split factor, and Labour would have to make some absurd gains to claw their way up. 

That, and the area's remained more or less completely Liberal over the past five years' local elections- even in the face of the collapse nationwide. 

Clegg isn't going to lose it. He might lose the *leadership* after the election, but he certainly won't lose his seat. 

It'll certainly be one of the seats I'll be going out to campaign for next May. I'll be in the area, and, all things considered, Clegg's been the best leader the Lib Dems could have hoped for over this coalition- the problems have been much, much wider than him. I'd be horrified to see him go- half because he's been an excellent leader, and half because the alternatives that have spent the past four years circling like vultures are universally *appalling*. 

The Lib Dems scraping into coalition again would be marvellous. The Lib Dems being knocked down to 30 seats would be unfortunate, but weatherable. The Lib Dems being knocked down to thirty or fewer seats, *and switching leader to Tim Farron* would be an absolute calamity- the party wouldn't survive another decade.

I don't imagine in my wildest dreams that UKIP could run the country, but that fact that they are garnering so much attention (and so many votes) proves that a large number of people in the UK are unhappy with the current government and like some of the things UKIP stand for.

Abolishing inheritance tax is a brilliant idea. This tax only affects the middle class and is completely unfair. If you're rich you can invest, create hedge funds and stash money in foreign bank accounts which you can pass on tax free when you die. If you're poor you're not affected, But if you're somewhere in between and you manage to inherit above £100k from a dead relative you not only have to mourn the loss of your loved one but also the fact that the government steals HALF of that from you. 50%!!! That's ludicrous!

Withdrawing from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights is just about the United Kingdom governing itself rather than us living under the rule of some dickheads in Brussels. Rather than the 'pick and choose' mentality currently adopted by our government we can just create our own bill (which will almost be identical) and and add and subtract rights as we see fit. I don't know about you but the day prisoners get the vote is the day I stop voting. If my vote is worth the same as a convicted rapist's or a murderer's or a paedophile's then my vote is worth fuck all! You go to prison to be both punished and rehabilitated and in that process you loose a number of your rights, such as the right to freedom and the right to vote.

I don't really know how you could criticise the jobs for veterans policy. At the end of the day its only there if they want it and there will be a magnitude of training and assessment to assure the individuals are fit the for role.

The foreign aid will be cut as UKIP will favour Britain over other countries (as all the parties should) but they would still provide disaster relief and schemes which provide water and inoculation against preventable diseases.

This thread hasn't even mentioned a number of UKIP's best policies such as:
-Scrapping HS2 - What a waste of money and resource to provide a 15 minute shorter journey to Birmingham of all places! Its independently projected to cost up to £80 billion!!!!
-Increase the tax fee threshold to £13,500 - This is in line with the amount a full time minimum wage worker would earn meaning that the poorest workers would live tax free
-Leaving the EU and agreeing a free trade deal - The UK is one of the biggest importers in the EU. Anyone who thinks the EU would tax us if we left is incorrect, it would cost them way more money than it would cost us. And by leaving the EU we would be free to govern our own country and control immigration properly
-Their education policies include free tuition fees for STEM courses (as our country is in need of engineers and scientists etc.); they will stop this nonsense about sending every kid to university - some people don't need/want to go to University and we've created a society where you need a degree and £27,000 in debt to drive a fucking bus! UKIP will promote apprenticeships and vocational courses that will actually lead into jobs
-In Healthcare, UKIP will protect the NHS from the Tories who are hell bent in selling it off! The NHS is the best thing that ever happened to this country and is something worth protecting. I don't care if I'm in a stable job for the rest of my life and am never ill, I would never regret the money I'm taxed going towards someone else's treatment. We don't live in the dark ages and thank God we don't live in America, the rich living and the poor dying of treatable illnesses is not acceptable in a developed nation in the 21st century. Labour, the party that created the NHS, are planning on charging people to visit their GP!
- UKIP's energy policies are quite controversial due to the current global warming fad but I have been sceptical for a few years and have yet to been shown any conclusive evidence of manmade global warming and I believe it has been used as a front in order to tax the shit out of us on the essentials in life: energy and heat. UKIP would scrap green taxes cutting energy bills drastically and would utilise the goldmine that is shale gas sitting right under our feet.

UKIP have many more good policies that I haven’t got the time to go into, but I think the strongest one that is often overlooked is how democratic they have promised to be. If UKIP were in power they would allow the people the trigger referendums on controversial issues and they would encourage their MP’s to actually vote on behalf of their constituents rather than for the party. UKIP wouldn’t go back on their word on pledges as the Lib Dems did with tuition fees. True democracy has been omitted by our government for years and UKIP promise to strive to actually represent the majority, rather than the few.

No I don’t think UKIP are the answer and I don’t think they could lead on their own (not yet anyway). But I think they’re the party that is going to shake up British politics over the next few years and better represent the average Briton.

My grandfather bought a modest house for £2,000 in 1940. It had huge sentimental value for the entire family; my mother and her brothers grew up there, and all of the grandchildren spent every holiday there. 

When he died, the area in which he had bought it had become 'desirable' and as a consequence it was worth three quarters of a million quid.

None of us cared about the value of the house, but we loved the place and wanted to keep it in our family. 

Inheritance tax - as it is currently structured - meant that between my mum and two uncles, they would have had to come up with £170,000 in tax just to keep the house. PLUS 40% of any gain on the value of the property in between the date that my grandfather died (and the house was valued by HMRC) and what it actually sold for.

A reminder - the entire cost of the house had been originally £2,000. 

None of us had anything like that kind of money, even collectively, so we had to sell it, and lost the house in which the whole family had grown up.

Of course my mother and her siblings were able to split the profit from the sale so nobody was really losing out in *financial* terms, but like I say, we didn't give a shit about the money.

*Point 1*

I do not come from an especially wealthy family, but we did alright. Everything my folks have earned or own has paid tax on - at rates far higher than what I deem reasonable. And yet, when my parents pass, I am expected to pay 40% to the Gov. 

Anybody with half a brain can find a whole range of ways to legally avoid paying it. But there are a lot of people from my type of background, who have not had the exposure that I have and are not aware of these routes.

They will have modest inheritances, and have to pay 40% tax on any amount over £325k. It is theft pure and simple, and *only affects the middle class*. 

The rich can avoid it, the poor are exempt. Its just another squeeze on the productive middle class.

Morally, I don't think it is a just tax, although I understand how it was used to break up land ownership.

*Point 2*

40% income tax rate applies to all salary over £31k-150k.

41k (31k + 10k percy) is really nothing. Its ok for a grad to have a few toys in his inner city box flat.

This is not a salary that can get you on the property ladder or support a family. The 20% rate should be extended way up to £100k - probably even to £250k. 

These are not super rich people. If you think they are then I feel sorry for you.

There is so much ridiculous wealth out there, and it all knows how to legally avoid tax. *The Gov don't care because they put their money into Government bonds anyway in exchange for investor visas and tax breaks*.

The only people a 40% tax hit are again, the middle classes. The people who run their own businesses, creating jobs for their local communities.

Someone taxed 45% on 250k income, pays £102,500 in tax (after 10k percy). 
Someone taxed 20% on 250k income, pays £40k in tax (after 10k percy).

For a local businesses that 60k that could be spent on expansion or jobs, but instead is being allocated by those with basically zero qualification to do so.

*Point 3* 

Don't know enough about it the fine detail of this law, but I did work in the Green finance sector for a period and not one person believed the science. However, there are inv banks and hedge funds building huge positions around regulatory developments. 

I quite like the idea of green energy, but I have been tainted by my experiences. It was quite surreal where to clients, brokers would be super bullish on projects, and then privately they'd shit talk it.

Invariably, situations tended to end up with the wind turbine catching fire.

These days the EU ETS has more or less failed, Australia's Carbon tax was repealed, none of the major polluters take environmental regulation seriously, CERs are trading close to record low prices, and VERs are basically not worth shit these days. I guess technically, yes, Environmental regulation is particularly redundant.

The issue is basically this. Pollution does not have borders. Industrial Production does. Carbon prices are correlated with Industrial Production. 

This means that due to the low price and huge over supply of credits (and production fraud too), polluters have bought decades worth of worthless credits, ensuring that they can keep on doing what they are doing. Countries like the UK who play by the rules are the ones who suffer from restricted industrial capacity.

I may be wrong by this is what I imagine the point would be. It is not so much the science, but the fact that the system is broken.

*Point 4* 

Would prefer our soldiers were not fighting bogus wars in the first place. I share your concerns.

It is a nice way of saying, 'bribes'. Its not really significant to our budget but seems to be a bit of a moral position. Bribes are bad right?

This is consistent with my figures: Scotland's GDP in 2010 was £127.5Bn (Quarterly National Accounts Q1 2010, Scottish Govt).

In 2009-10, we contributed 9.4% and got 9.3%. UK still spent £14Bn more in Scotland than we gave. For us to match that spend we'd be running a deficit of 29% (£62.1 vs £48.1)

This is a difference of £13.9Bn, which is 10.9%. (13.9/127.5 = 0.1090, or 10.9%).

Funny enough, Poch or Bielsa or Schmidt would probably say forward. Move the ball as quickly up the pitch as possible. That's the cornerstone of verticality. 

Assists give us stats on direct involvement but not on indirect involvement. Eriksen hasn't been on form lately, but he did set up the chance for Lamela to assist. And there's no mention of Lamela, who's assisted what? Five or six himself? So why are we avoiding that comparison? And like I've said elsewhere, Eriksen isn't fully comfortable in the new system yet. At Ajax, the buildup was never as quick as Poch wants and he needs time on the ball to make things happen. How do we know that Siggy would've fit in seamlessly? 

&gt;Hell, Hugo Lloris's passes are probably 99% forward, should we play him in the number ten?

Well, how good are his free kicks and passing ability? Haha.

In a world where alien sun gods grow up on farms in Kansas; police scientist are time traveling, inter-dimensional beings; space cops wear rings that can make anything out of light; water dwelling, eco-terrorist, kings are the good guys; and demigoddesses inexplicably wear red ,white, and blue and can make any man completely submissive with a bit of rope. Yes, Batman is stable.

And Dick Grayson needed to help bring the man to justice that killed his parents. Like Bruce, Dick's parents died a violent death right in front of him. Unlike Bruce he had someone to help him get the closure he needed so that he wouldn't become a melancholy, obsessive, distrustful, arrogant adult like Batman himself. Robin is the child Batman never got to be. Bruce gave Dick that gift.

&gt;it's not definitive that the Joker was the result of the redhood job considering his story is changed regularly,

That's the one part of his his story that is always consistent. Who he was underneath the Red Hood is what is variable.

&gt;The difference between the Flash and the Doctor is that the Doctor could hypothetically just jump back in time and prevent Bruce Wayne from ever existing. 

Except the flash has literally done this. He went back in time (w/o a time machine, just by being the Flash) to save his mother from being murdered when he was a boy. Why? Because the **villainous version of him Professor Zoom the Reverse Flash**, was the one who went back in time to kill her. This led to Bruce being murdered and not his parents, Barry never becoming Flash and a whole host of major changes in the Universe. 

Do you know who fixed it? **The motherfucking Flash**. He hooks up with hardcore Batman (Thomas Wayne, Bruce's dad) and recreates the experiment that gave him his powers and then he fucking runs. But he's done to much damage. So he has to rewrite the entire multiverse so existence doesn't collapse.

And that's how the New 52 happened. Even Barry's grandson, Bart, casually traveled back from the 31st century and hangs out with the Teen Titans in the present. Time travel is child's play for the Flash family (and the Zoom's).

&gt;he's arguably smarter than Batman

So is Lex Luthor, Brainiac, Mr. Freeze, Riddler, Max Lord. Do you no why they lose? Because they manage to somehow be even more arrogant than Batman. Something which The Doctor definitely is (especially 10 and 12).

&gt;the ability to unravel much of the known universe considering he's capable of instant travel to any location at any time.

Not really. He can do what the Tardis lets, she holds all the power in that relationship. An arrogant time traveler who is barely in control of his means of transportation is small time for the Justice League.

CIA, a lot more guns instead of the gadgets they had in the first seasons, they made a few very forced and unfunny jokes about Britain, and British people (I am not from the UK, I wasn't offended by them, I just thought they were unnecessary) Also, for some reason Gwen was really fucking exited when they were standing on the beach in California, ""We've reached the edge of America!!!"".

Dermatologist tested. Use: morning and evening on damp skin. Do not shake before use. Rinse with water. All skin types.""*

**About you:** Combo dehydrated break out prone skin.

**Your opinion:** First thing I notice is the fragrance, it. does. not. fade. No really, wash if off, dry skin, still smells, toner, still smells, serum, still smells, moisturiser, still smells. Not entirely surprised though as it's not even at least halfway down the ingredients list. Other thing I noticed is that it's ever so slightly stripping, sensitive/drier skin types will probably notice it more. Otherwise, bog standard instant foam cleanser skin's clean with no residue, pH of 5-6ish.

false,AnxiousMo-Fo,,"Labour (if you are too, check out /r/LabourUK!)","The debates should absolutely include Conservatives, Labour, Lib Dems, Ukip and the Greens. Nothing else is even remotely reasonable. There's [an article on LabourList](http://labourlist.org/2014/10/labour-wants-the-tv-debates-but-todays-proposals-are-flawed/) pointing out that the 2-3-4 suggestion, apart from all its other flaws, is backwards: If anything, it should start with a broad view of all the parties and finish with the two people who might actually be PM. I still don't think it's a great format, though.

Personally, I'd prefer all the parties mentioned above taking part in four debates: One for each of the great offices of state (foreign secretary, home secretary, chancellor and PM). It would stop the 'presidential' focus on the leaders and give people a better idea of what the parties stand for as a whole. Also, a debate about foreign policy would be hilarious, because they'd virtually all say the same thing. I'm not totally sure how this could work for the smaller parties who don't have enough MPs to fill all the positions; either they'd be excluded from the first three and just take part in the 'PM' debate or they could be allowed to use their MEPs to make up the numbers.

I'd then have one final debate featuring leaders of *all* the minor parties not featured above, which would be extra hilarious. I want to see the Socialist Workers' Party yelling at the Socialist Labour Party for misinterpreting Marx, before they both gang up to denounce everyone else as fascists. I want to hear the Pirate Party explain that copyright reform is the most pressing issue facing Britain today, and suggest we'd save loads of money if the entire public sector switched to using Debian GNU/Linux. I want someone from Plaid Cymru to insist on speaking Welsh for the whole thing (I know, I know, their current leader doesn't speak Welsh). I want the leader of the Monster Raving Loony Party to inexplicably shine and get every single one of their candidates elected.

false,PoachTWC,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"I have two answers:

**First**, UK National Debt, by the UK Government's own numbers, was at 75.2% of GDP at the start of the 2013 financial year (April).

At the start of the financial year in 2009 (April), national debt was 53.2% of GDP. http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/psa/public-sector-finances/april-2009/index.html

An increase of 22%. I got 12% because I took the start date as April 2010 by accident (62.1% of GDP in debt). The UK from 2010-2013 increased national debt by 13.1%. http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/psa/public-sector-finances/april-2013/stb---april-2013.html

Thus Scotland's has still went 5% higher. 

If we start Scotland in 2010 we're overspent by 30.4Bn which is 20.7%, versus the UK's 13.1%. 7.6% higher. Scotland is still overspending more.

**Second**, I re-did my maths because of my miscalculation. Taking my post where I list every GERS year:

2012-13: Scotland gives the UK £53.1Bn (9.1% revenue). UK Government and Scottish Government spend £65.2Bn (9.3% spending). Scotland is up £12.1Bn.

Scotland's budget deficit was 5.9% of GDP, £8.6Bn. UK's budget deficit was 5.8% of GDP, £91.1Bn.

In 2011-12 we contributed 9.9% of revenue and got back 9.3%. UK still spent £7.4Bn more in Scotland than we gave. For us to match that spend we'd be running a deficit of 13% (£64.5 vs £56.9). Scotland is up £7.6Bn.

In 2010-11 we contributed 9.6% and got 9.3%. UK still spent £10.7Bn more in Scotland than we gave. For us to match that spend we'd be running a deficit of 20% (£63.8 vs £53.1). Scotland is up £10.7Bn.

In 2009-10, we contributed 9.4% and got 9.3%. UK still spent £14Bn more in Scotland than we gave. For us to match that spend we'd be running a deficit of 29% (£62.1 vs £48.1). Scotland is up £14Bn.

12.1+7.6+10.7+14= 44.4Bn. Scotland's GDP is £146.19Bn.

Since 2009 our debt has gone up by 30.4% of GDP, not the 27% I originally cited. My apologies for that, but fixing this actually helps my case.

*UK debt since 2009: +22%
Scottish debt since 2009: +30.4%
Difference: 8.4%.*

Scotland benefits financially from being in the UK because Scotland is overspending by more than the UK is. The 2010 figure suggests Scotland is moving in the right direction, but Scottish cuts will be deeper to reach break even. Large economies can deal with high debt to GDP ratios. The experience of Ireland, Portugal, Iceland and possibly Spain has shown us smaller economies cannot. Scotland survived the 2008 crisis and is part of Europe's fastest growing economy due to the UK's size and resilience. Were we like Ireland we'd have gone under as they did.

Also, the Master was told they would give him a new regeneration cycle in exchange for the paradox gate with Tennant, so it's been stated it's possible. Also I believe River Song tried to give her regeneration energy as well to resurrect the Doctor after shooting him dead in the middle of a regeneration cycle, only to find out it was a ship with the doctor inside it, and he wasn't actually killed. So we don't know if giving regenerations from one person to another is culmulative or simply restorative.

An indy Scotland would be quite much the same that the UK, but it will be more volatile because of its reliance on oil. If Scotland is able to create a fund to reduce the impact of oil price variations (Like Norway did, or like Chile did with copper) then it will be probably stay the same. 


ps: please, dont dare compare the cases of Portugal or Spain with the one of Scotland. I would say that economies that originally have more debt at the start of a crisis have a much tougher time to get out of said crisis.

I think it had to do with the parents not being comfortable with football at such an early age. Anyway, despite playing HS and a bit of college FB, soccer was always my first sports love. World Cup? Always watched. Favorite club team? Didn't have one. 


Enter the Premier League about 10 years ago. I didn't have a team to cheer for, so I just watched and became a fan of teams that played attractive football and tended to win. I wanted to get my feet wet with the dynamics of the league before settling on a team I would call my own. My initial favorites were Arsenal with Thierry Henry and Chelsea, but I had a solid mix of Bolton appreciation under Sam Allardyce and also Fulham due to the Americans that played there. Teams I could never get behind were Man U, Newcastle, Liverpool, Villa and a bunch of the scrubs like West Ham. Tottenham seemed to have a tortured past, but a lot of promise, solid management and financials under Daniel Levy, and a rooster as a mascot, go figure. Slowly, Tottenham had become my team. They had hit bottom of the table and facing relegation when I was in London for a day on a layover and decided to check out White Hart Lane. Chelsea had a home game that day, and West Ham, Arsenal and Fulham intrigued me, but above them all, I wanted to see Tottenham. 


Not wanting to pay 150 pounds for a ticket, I went to the ground thinking I could buy one from a scalper/tout, but sadly, no dice.  So, I walked around the Lane, chatted it up with the few vendors out there and waited until the match was over.  It was raining, and looked pretty old, but it was White Hart Lane and it had a ton of history. Newly promoted Hull was in town and tore Tottenham a new one...which pissed off all the supporters whose passion I was shocked to see... and thought to myself that this is something I could get behind.  I was leaning that way, but the supporters' fury clinched it.  If they were that irate about a loss to Hull City, I'd like some of that.  That shit is for me.  Signed, sealed, delivered. It's all about the Spurs for me now.

3. This coalition said they would do the same, and in fact most governments have I'm sure, whether UKIP would actually deliver on this front I'm sceptical.

4. It's almost like foreign aid budgets are planned years in advance. In all seriousness it's such a tiny part of the UK budget I really don't see any significant savings being made, it's hardly practical and is more 'common sense' politics that don't actually hold up under scrutiny. The foreign aid budget helps the poorest overseas, buys influence and is a strong tool for soft power, and helps UK business abroad.

5. Not against, although not far reaching enough.

6. Is this a really big deal? Aren't investigations and inspections carried out by OFSTED fairly regularly? Not entirely against.

7. Mental health care is good, however I'm more impressed with the Lib Dem's on this front.

8. A party promising otherwise would ensure it's destruction.

9. Don't see this as too much of a problem, especially as so many immigrants will pay more in tax than what they use in services over their time here. Isn't screaming for reform. Health tourism is actually a net positive, with most people paying for their treatment for the NHS from abroad.

I heeded the advice given, but I still had an internal struggle when it came to leaving the table.  I felt like I was committing a cardinal sin by not leaving a tip on the table when we left a pub or restaurant.  

There are pros and cons to gratuities being tied to a server's income.  The pros are that you'll tend to get decent service because the server is earning their gratuity by way of providing good service.  Better service usually equals better tips.  The con is that you can work your arse off and still get stiffed on the tip.  Although, what happens when a server is paid a wage, isn't dependent on gratuities to pay their bills, and then turn out to be poor servers and provide really bad service to paying customers?  How do establishments deal with employees like that?  The level of service can make or break a restaurant over here.

Best thing to do is to look at the fixture lists and find a team near to where you will be staying and see when they will be playing. There is a reasonable turn out for both the premier league and the First Division and most towns have a amateur team which will play on a Saturday.

&gt;Lamela only has 3 in the league, and Sigurdsson kept lamela out of the lw for half a season.

Wait what?!
Lamela was bought specifically for the right. He was meant to be a Bale replacement, or at least the closest one anyway. And he was out injured for the year, nobody was keeping him out of the team. And I don't know which Spurs you were watching, but even when AVB was in charge, he started using Townsend and started phasing out Siggy more and more. That trend continued into Sherwood. 

&gt;But I had no idea they were precisely only half as good as him. Or at least that's what the stats say.

Yeah, I'm not going to bother addressing that. Eriksen had 7 goals and the same amount of assists in about nine or so games. So yeah, they're comparable as players in a free role, but in terms of everything else, Eriksen's miles ahead. It was kind of a public secret that Siggy was wasted on the wing with us. Eriksen thrived there and got us a shit ton of goals and assists in the last nine or so games. 

And soccer's not a purely stats game you know. Pirlo registers assists in the low single digits almost every season, and going by statistical metrics like the one you're propagating, the Juve ultras should be knocking down Allegri's door to get Siggy.

Townsend's been enough of a threat in matches (both at the start of last season and on England duty) that I think we should persist with him.

There's only been a few incidents where he's been way off and it's usually because of external issues or the Tardis is repairing but instead of just trying again he goes with the flow. As well it's not a matter of the Doctor being a bit cocky, it's a matter of over 1000 years of knowledge and experience fighting enemies on his own, and winning through sheer intelligence and brutality, that on paper would give the Justice League cause for concern. The Doctor is not just smarter than Batman, he's light years ahead of the Bat in terms of deduction, knowledge of the universe, and tactical thinking. Again, he's been exploring all of time and the universe and winning battles for over 1000 years. And yes I've read Flashpoint. 

Also I'm not just referring to Dick Grayson, I'm also referring to Jason Todd, (Going by the revamped origin story rather than the Dick Grayson rip off one where he was an orphan on the streets because his mother overdosed and his father was likely killed). He took the orphan in, essentially gave him the Robin mantle thinking he could fix him and in the end got him killed. Then their is Tim Drake who actually tried to get out of being Robin to protect his family only to be sucked in during War Games. His father being killed by Captain Boomerang he then gets adopted by Bruce and the cycle of horrible lives of pain and loss is continued.

Also, in a world where all those types of people exist Batman is still unstable. There may be all kinds of weird in the world but out of a population of 7 billion the number of crazy is just as proportionate as it is in the real world, and Batman would still be a lunatic. His adventures with the JL aren't the norm for him. He spends most of his time fighting other mortal humans in Gotham who also happen to be crazy just in a different way and sometimes when the writers take a break from beating off to the Bat he actually loses. Loses to regular mortal humans. Batman is no different than Wyatt Earp. Wyatt was an absolute psycho in a land filled with outlaws. The difference was he fought on the side of law men rather than for his own personal fortune. The Bat would very likely lose to the Doctor, and many members of the JL would as well.

I might need to go back and watch some matches and so on and so on, but I don't remember a single minute of last season where he swapped wings mid-match. It might be missing something. Or you could spare me the hours of looking for it and just direct me some place. Keep in mind that I think you're in a 2013-14 mindset. 

And just because he started one match last season doesn't mean that someone kept him out of the team. By that logic, Soldado was locked away in some miserable gulag this time last year.

&gt;I don't even understand what you're saying, first you say you're not going to bother addressing that then you go ahead and address it anyway, then you go rambling about eriksen having 7 of goals and assists from something?? And also claiming he is miles ahead of him? I struggle to find ONE thing eriksen is actually better than sigurdsson at (aside from reaction timing/acceleration) yet you claim he is miles ahead than him like it's supposed to be fucking obvious?? What are you saying man! if you're going to make bold irrational statements at least clarify wtf you are on about

Are you having a laugh? 

You really remember none percent of last season's second act? Eriksen was phenomenal for us on all accounts-on the wing, in the middle of the 4-4-2, scoring two goals against Southampton, all of it was nice and he did it all within ten or so matches. Eriksen's form at the end of last season is what Siggy's doing now. Seriously, you must've not watched a single game all of last season to say something like ""Eriksen is worse than dogshit and Siggy is inifinitely better"". Besides scoring some nice goals, Siggy did the square root of fuck all for us. Maybe it was just Spurs and he failed here. I'm not going to lose any sleep over Siggy scoring a ton for a mid table side, which is something that he couldn't do with us. 

&gt;I struggle to find ONE thing eriksen is actually better than sigurdsson at (aside from reaction timing/acceleration) yet you claim he is miles ahead than him like it's supposed to be fucking obvious??

He's a much smarter player. I doubt that Siggy could play much better in a demanding system like what Poch is trying to do. Eriksen's off the ball movement and his ability to play in any position across the front three makes him priceless for a side like ours, thin in attack and with garbage winger depth. We already tried Siggy on the wing and it didn't work. He wasn't fast or smart enough. 

&gt;but stats in the premier league mean a lot.
Not as much as you're claiming they do. This is a snapshot of seven games and you're using stats as a platform to explain why a failed midfielder at this club is better than one of Europe's better prospects. We'll see where everything stands after the 38.

I'm kidding. :P It was probably more a case that they didn't want to just imitate Ten's exit. It's not a competition, as /u/dearbluey says; though, I must agree that his departure sucked, sucked, was lovingly poignant, but still sucked.

It would be interesting to see who did vote for this and to know whether the Conservatives *(and even the LDs)* were whipped.

If the 350 or so MPs who didn't vote were instructed that they were not permitted to vote against the division it dramatically changes the nature of the result.

Here there is one doctors surgery, one primary school, one dentist, one large shop, 2 busses, and one road in and out of the place. No train station and no secondary school.

Now, there are currently developments ongoing to add around 800 new houses to the village, possibly rising to 1000 new houses depending on a couple of contracts that are up in the air. That means, working on averages, an increase of 3200-4000 people. Do you not think the current residents should have a say on whether or not their local area should double in population and suffer the consequences thereof? If they want to build houses *AND* improve local infrastructure then I wouldn't mind that. But the government just needs to fill quotas, the local authorities just crave the money incentives and there is no second thought given to the implications of allowing a massive housing development to be built in a small place.

- UKIP proposes a brownfield revolution to address the housing crisis.  Non affiliates estimate that there is enough unprocessed brownfield property in UK to provide for 1.5 million to 2.5 million homes.  UKIP proposes creating a national database, removing much of the red tape, providing government grants paid by floated brownfield bonds to pay for decontamination, removing stamp duty from first time sales and reducing VAT on development of sites.

- UKIP would be able to reduce energy bills significantly by keeping existing coal plants open, removing carbon swaps and green taxes, whilst reducing emissions in the future by emphasising a hybrid energy solution of nuclear, geothermal, gas, and tidal.

- UKIP would be able to reduce household food bills by withdrawing from the CAP whilst maintaining a single holding farm subsidy for UK farms.  It has then pledged to remove the Common External Tariff from all African nations to enable them to develop their agrarian sectors, with an emphasis on trade not aid outside medicine, water, and food.

- UKIP would scrap the landfill tax lowering costs for councils and which would allow farmers to dredge silt from our riverbeds to offset flooding (or to displace it) and to use the natural fertiliser on their crops.  They propose using previous money ear marked for the foreign aid budget to invest in waterway management and flood defence.

- UKIP oppose the government's cut to Legal Aid.   

- UKIP oppose selling of personal data such as that collected by the NHS to third parties.

- UKIP supports a default shared custody for separated parents, giving both mother and father equal footing.

- UKIP opposes gender short lists for its members advocating meritocracy, and rejects the traditional whip system, which means that the best candidate representing their electorate first, party second.    

- UKIP would establish a sovereign wealth fund from natural resources such as shale gas.

- UKIP supports the Right To Recall.    

- UKIP supports devolution and localism.

- UKIP supports a Swiss stylised direct democracy in a civilian initiative for addressing contentious cross party issues of the generation.

- UKIP advocates consolidating all education examination boards into one.  One paper per subject.

- They wish to introduce an apprenticeship scheme at schools equivalent to 4 non-core GCSEs which could be carried through to college.

- UKIP advocates the return of full UK habeas corpus by withdrawing from the European Arrest Warrant and replacing it with an extradition treaty, and the formation of a 21st century UK Bill of Rights.

- UKIP would stop PFI from being used in the NHS in the future, and argue that the NHS would be opted out of trade deals, like TTIP, and ISDS.

&gt; Many of us who are anti ukip believe that those that are pro ukip (espescially their working class voters) aren't informed about what they are voting for. As a result these things need to be brought to public attention.

I'm perfectly ok with this with all parties, not just UKIP.  If we could quietly chat about it over a cup of tea with a **[chocolate Hobnob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmCIlAkeS4Y#t=29)** I suspect you'd agree that there's a lot of spitefully vitriolic responses to UKIP.  This genuinely is a problem because if you carefully explain something and I tell UKIP voters they're a pack of racist cunts your response is drowned out by mine.

You have to be careful with that, *""espescially their working class voters""* bit because it comes perilously close to, ""The Working Class are too ignorant to think for themselves!""  It might not be what you mean, but if you think about the way the class structure here works, it comes with some considerable contextual weight.

Added to which I could point you at about half a dozen Middle Class people who avoid the news media but read the Daily Mail for celebrity gossip.  They may not read the Mail for the news, but in effect this becomes their only news source.  So, the very issue you abhor is not actually one of class.

&gt; This is compounded by the assertion that ""it's a one off"" when yet another elected ukip representative makes a racist comment

I genuinely believe that a lot of this is that UKIP Councillors and MEPs are less stage managed and coached than others.  

Well, ok there's a second thing I think is relevant:  Running under the UKIP banner is certain to illicit more spite than under another party's.  This means that they'll attract more, hmmmmm, unhinged candidates.

Allow me to share with you a comment made some time ago by an MP:

&gt;“A high and rising proportion of children are being born to mothers least fitted to bring children into the world. Some are of low intelligence, most of low educational attainment. They are unlikely to be able to give children the stable emotional background, the consistent combination of love and firmness. They are producing problem children. The balance of our human stock, is threatened.”

This was said by a Conservative MP named Keith Joseph in 1974.  Much like Enoch Powell's Rivers of Blood speech it more or less killed his chances of attaining high office.  *(Vaguely interestingly if he hadn't said this he might have ended up Prime Minister instead of Thatcher.)*

What MPs learned from this is to hide, rather than curb their contempt for the electorate.  Gordon Brown describing a voter as, **[""Some sort of bigoted woman""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTr8IVWBuPE#t=304)** was a rare glimpse behind the curtain.  It's ok to think someone's a bigot.  It's not ok to pretend to your face you're valued and as soon as you think you're out of sight to pull that crap.  It's even less ok to pretend that you're mortified about it.  Being mortified that you got caught is far from being the same as being sorry for doing something.

The degree of stage management is what brings us hilarious moments like Ed Miliband saying, **[""These strikes are wrong!""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCem9EZb-YA)** over and over like a broken toy.

As a final point a couple of weeks ago Boris Johnson referred to investors from *(I think)* Hong Kong as, **[""oligarchs from the Planet Zog.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R_uzDtA-ZU)**  This isn't meaningfully different or worse than Bloom's, *""Bongo Bongo Land""* comment.  To give you a bit of context that was essentially arguing that new homes built in London should be marketed to British people, rather than foreigners.

&gt; On the other hand, why are those that are pro UKIP so against them being in the news? Are the things they say worth getting embarrassed about? Perhaps of you are embarrassed by the opinions of a party member it should be taken into account when voting for them?

I can't honestly say I've seen much of this opinion.  What I have seen a lot of on reddit was complaints that UKIP were getting attention when they didn't even have an MP in the Commons.

Letting MPs speak and reveal their true selves is always a good thing.  It's not helped by the fact that all our media sources up to and including the BBC are hopelessly corrupted and biased more to soundbite peddling rather than honest reporting.  *(It's not really that I think the BBC is better than the others, but it's the only media source we're entitled to expect NOT to peddle an agenda.)*

If they don’t reply, nothing will happen, until your MP gets a further email which says there are now 50, then 75, 100, 150 — until it is nonsensical not to reply and start talking.

An additional camera, on an articulating arm, was mounted in the aircraft's bomb bay and allowed 360-degree shots from below the aircraft. The top gun turret was replaced with a clear dome for the aerial director, who would co-ordinate the other aircraft by radio.

&gt;__Jewish insurgency in Palestine__ refers to violent campaigns carried out by Jewish underground groups against the British forces and officials in [Mandatory Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine) between 1939 and 1947. The tensions between Jewish militant underground organizations and the British mandatory authorities rose from 1938 and intensified with the publication of the [MacDonald White Paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Paper_of_1939) of 1939, which proposed restrictions on Jewish immigration and independence for Palestine with an Arab majority after ten years. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] Though World War II brought relative calm, the tensions again escalated into an armed struggle towards the end of the war, when it became clear that the Axis Powers were close to defeat. The struggle lasted until the establishment of the [State of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel) in 1948.

Anyway all this is said with my usual proviso that I expect it somewhat likely that shale gas extraction in the UK will prove to be uneconomic due to unfavourable geology, and that instead of getting our collective knickers in a twist about fracking, there's a large set of much deeper problems facing us which we would do well to acknowledge and try to figure out.",0,1413272688,null,0,false,0,cl8zvlz,t3_2j738i,t1_cl8zvlz,t3_2j738i,null,1426536614,23,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,23

You should write to the estate agent stating that you consider them to be in breach of contract and are seeking restitution from them for losses incurred.  Tell them you want a refund of all money you've paid, plus some extra to cover additional expenses you've incurred.  Tell them they've got 28 days to settle the matter and pay you £X or you'll make a filing at the small claims court.

&gt;1) It’s 2014 people!…it isn’t the sexist 1970s anymore!

Huh? If women want to do it, shouldn't they be allowed to? Isn't that the opposite of sexism?

&gt;2) We’re talking about soft porn in a family newspaper that kids see!! Until 2003 the models were only 16 (and dressed up in school ties and hats – seriously!) It’s never been ok!!! We will look back on this and go ‘oh my goodness, we did what?’

WONT SOMEBODY THINK OF THE CHILDREN!

They're at more risk from reading the fucking articles in the Sun than the tits. 

&gt;3) What are we teaching kids? They see page after page of pictures of men in clothes doing stuff (you know, running the country, achieving in sport!) and what are the women doing in this society they’re learning about? Er, they’re standing in their pants showing their breasts for men... It’s not really fair, is it?

&gt;They see page after page of pictures of men in clothes doing stuff (you know, running the country, achieving in sport!)

BAHAHAHAHA, they're are plenty of ""topless men"" magazines too....

&gt;Er, they’re standing in their pants showing their breasts for men... It’s not really fair, is it?

&gt;4) Women say and do and think interesting and incredible things. They are people, people! Not things! Not ‘that’ The fact that we hear ‘look at the tits on that’ or ‘I’d do that’ is disgusting and disrespectful! And Page 3 of The Sun is the icon that normalizes this horrible sexist banter. Urgh.

roflcopter, so you're calling people sexist while at the same time trying to insinuate that a woman with her breasts out can't do/think interesting and incredible things. BRAVO

&gt;5) Every weekday for the last 44 years in The Sun newspaper the largest female image has been of a young woman showing her breasts for men, indicating that whatever else a woman achieves, her primary role is to serve men sexually. Pretty rubbish that really.

&gt;6) The Sun newspaper could be soooo much better without Page 3. Any story they do about women’s issues such as rape, sexual abuse and domestic violence or the dangers of online porn is drowned out by the neon sign that Page 3 is that says ‘shut up, girls, and get your tits out.’

This is some serious Feminazi bullshit, fuck off back to Tumblr

false,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;I am not going to cry any tears for anyone at any age who is struggling to live with a mere £350,000 pounds worth of assets. Sorry if that sounds callous but I'm really not going to.

If you have assets of £350,000, and your home is worth £350,000, then in reality you have almost nothing available to you. You are not living off £350,000, you could be living off a tiny state pension. 

As I have said before, having an expensive house is not just for the rich, house prices have put many people in the taxable asset range when they were never meant to be. It can put people in a very difficult situation, such as having to consider selling their home, at a time when they shouldn't have to worry about such things, and be enjoying their final years.

You might say that many people have it worse, and that these people should be grateful for having such problems, but I think that it is a problem that a very large number of people will face, and its not just the poor we should be concerned about, it is all people in our society. 

&gt;Oh come on that's a straw man and we both know it.

Its no more ridiculous than your statement: ""One is literally profiting at the expense of the other, how can it not be a poor vs rich debate?""

&gt;Money is not what is taxed, it is the exchange of money that is taxed. You are gaining an exorbitant amount of money for absolutely no work, therefore that exchange is taxed. It's the fairest form of taxation by a long way.

So why is it not taxed at the same rate as income tax? In effect the money is taxed once as income tax, and again at 40%. That is a huge amount of money for the government to take. Money that has been earned by someone. Obliviously nothing is going to change your mind, but the vast majority of people believe that people should have the right to save and give money to their family. To help the next generation do better than the one before.

Nuclear is a contentious one - personally I think it's part of the solution but it's certainly not a panacea that can completely replace wind and solar.

One of the issues which comes up, of course, is the ""NIMBY"" one, which is that most of the claimed downsides of solar/wind happen in other parts of the world (the mining and extraction and disposal of the components which make up the necessary plant), but, if we're thinking globally, and clearly it's only partly the case that local and global effects are unrelated, we should be seriously concerned about human/water toxicity wherever it happens.

My observations, at this point, are that the paper is vague and unclear about the detail of the sources of toxicity, that the confidence limits are wide in a number of the findings, and that much of the good news for the fracking fraternity is crucially dependent on tight regulation and excellent practice, whereas the industry's performance to date has been woeful and it seems constitutionally unable or unwilling to change regardless of the promises it makes, and the deals it does with governments, regulators, communities, green organisations etc.  The sanctions and controls are hopelessly inadequate and insufficiently punitive to prevent abuse and corruption.  The small shell companies and start ups will be long gone, paying off the speculators, before sanctions can be brought to bear, and the tax payers and local communities will be left to pick up the tab and suffer the ill health.

4) When they return to their country of Origin (within the EU) they '[benefits](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/payment-of-disability-benefits-in-other-european-countries)' are refunded by the Govt in lieu of the Tax and NI they paid while living in the country

Yeah, stoopid innit. Aunt's 60th (mum coming over, all the family will be there, except the ones we don't like), old boss/great mate's 50th, and firework shennigans with some of my favourite fun party people. Last one is a gig I think.

I have to go to the first two. One is in Kent at starts at fucking 8pm, the other on a boat in Embankment. So that's going to be great flitting around O_O.

I've missed so many of the third group's things this year, fuck's sake, no fair, I miss those guys :(

It arguably beats the average bank account, but that's about it. it isn't the sort of investment that is going to double your money in your lifetime. 

as a further example, the current pricing on german govt bunds are notionally negative.  that means that investors are actually losing 0.5% a year to hold the bonds.  that is a price they are prepared to accept in order to have somewhere safe to store their money (if you have a lot of it, keeping it all in a bank account isn't risk free).

The marginal cost of borrowing and the marginal cost of taxation change depending on the volume of borrowing / taxation.

The best way to demonstrate this would be with a graph which I don't quite have time to do justice. I can scan a page from a corporate finance textbook later if you're interested?

The best (cheapest and most efficient) way to finance government expenditure, in reality, is to have a mix of tax and borrowing. Cheap (least damaging) taxes, plus cheap (lowest interest) borrowing.

You should always be looking at the marginal pound and working out the cheapest way to get that until you have met your spending needs.

Insist that it's cold. check V5 numbers with the frame. Take some paper towel and check the colour of the oil; black means the haven't been changing it.

Look how rusty the spark plug is (it's a £5, 2 min change for you, but will tell you about it's service history). check for oil on the forks. put it on the centre stand and check all the way around the tyres. Check the condition of the brake wear indicators. Check the lights and break lights on pedal and lever. Wheel it to a curb or straight line on the ground to check wheel/body alignment.

My personal political philosophy is more liberal socialist. So I would choose to spend more where it created surplus value over the cost of the spending.

The two issues are not the same however. One is political - what do we choose to spend or not spend, policy choices. This issue is economical - what is the *most efficient* and *utility maximizing* method of raising government funds for expenditure that has been determined by the political process.

It's also worth remembering the Greens won't even have candidates for most seats (they only fielded about 300 last time), so voting for them won't be an option for many.

**However**, my suspicion is that Cameron and Miliband will probably push for Green involvement alongside the LDs and UKIP though... why?...

* Any increase in Green popularity will come predominantly at the expense of the Lib dems... who already look set to take a beating at the next election. It might actually signal the end of the party as a serious political force if UKIP overtake them as 3rd party.

* In an ideal world what Cameron and Miliband will want are two ""head to head"" debates just between themselves, then a third ""all included"" debate with Nick Clegg, Nigel Farage and Caroline Lucas (Green) plus others perhaps. Why? Because it portrays UKIP as *""just another looney 3rd party spokesmen that can't win""*. In a way it denigrates UKIP who just polled 25% to the level of the Greens who are only polling at around 3%.

* Central to both the Labour and Conservative strategy (and remember contrary to popular belief, UKIP have cut both of their votes) is making UKIP out to be a single-issue protest vote rather than a serious party... hence why the Conservatives are plumming on their *""If you vote Farage you get Miliband""* tactic, which probably isn't an entirely honest appraisal of UKIPs voter base.",0,1413283718,null,0,1413283911,0,cl91tmp,t3_2j76mz,t1_cl91tmp,t3_2j76mz,null,1426535707,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

To you they are, to others they are, and to others they're not. Your views on political policy &amp; ideals generally depend on which way you lean in the spectrum.

So why not break the UK up? Why be 1/64m when you can be 1/54m and why stop there? Why not break it down back it to the vastly more traditional kingdoms? Oxfordshire was part of Mercia wasn't it? Sure that's a much smaller number hell why not just go with city states, worked for the Greeks back in the day and your vote would matter so much more if it was only 1/150,000 wouldn't?

Well no it wouldn't because while your vote might impact your choice in local policy more  the choices available to you as local policy would be vastly more dictated by the world around you in which you would then have no say.  

Now I'm obviously being absurd but my point is that while you might feel your vote has less of an impact in larger numbers those large numbers give the whole a much greater power that means that your policies are less prone to being dictated by the policies of more powerful outside interests in which you have no stake whatsoever.

The district is centred on Milton Keynes Village, the village that gave its name to the 'New City' of Milton Keynes, which began to be developed during the late 1960s. The Village also gives its name to the local civil parish, of which Middleton is the more populated district.

&gt; The village was originally known as Middeltone (11th century); then later as Middelton Kaynes or Caynes (13th century); Milton Keynes (15th century); and Milton alias Middelton Gaynes (17th century).[2] After the Norman invasion, the de Cahaines family held the manor from 1166 to the late 13th century as well as others in the country (Ashton Keynes, Somerford Keynes, and Horsted Keynes). During this time the village became known as Middleton de Keynes eventually shortening to Milton Keynes.

In my analysis I meant to divorce the political process (*deciding* the policy choice of tax and spend etc.) which is decided by votes and discussions, and the financing process (*optimising* the sources of government funds to minimise the cost of those funds).

Of course I agree entirely with the view (and its been very well established historically) that a government can tax and spend and increase aggregate utility, your examples of healthcare, education and security are perfect.

My introduction was meant to imply that, if we could, it would be great to have those expenditure projects without taxing people - but we need to get the money from somewhere, which will ultimately have (some) negative impact.

What I am arguing is that any government is going to spend *some* amount, so that needs to be financed.

This is going to come to a head in the next few years as quality of balancing supply worsens because of plant wear and tear, and grid stability will suffer.

We're currently on the route to follow them, with massive wind rollouts planned, with no real thought or budgeting for sufficient balancing capacity within the next few years.  Combined with various emissions acts coming into play, which will lead to various older coal and gas plants closing (around 20GW worth), there is going to be absolutely fuck all balancing capacity available towards the end part of this decade.

Current (2015) government spending is £731b, debt is £1.36t. Say we pay off 5% of that a year for 18 years (I have no idea what it'd be then, I suspect £500b+), then the government needs £800b. Income tax is around 30% of current tax takings, so we'd need to multiply it by about four.

It might not be what you mean, but if you think about the way the class structure here works, it comes with some considerable contextual weight.

Only if you are looking to be offended. It wasn't ""the working class"", it was ""**their** working class voters""

I say this for quite obvious reasons, their former policies (the ones they have released now have, in fairness, swung to the left a bit) would have worked against the interest of the working classes. While it is okay to vote against your own interests, many of us are not convinced these people are knowingly doing so.

Not only that, the working classes are the ones that the established political parties have abandoned, since Blair start leading the Labour party there hasn't really been a left wing in this country, these are the people that are desperate for some sort of hope, and UKIP present that hope, without substance.

Do I think the middle classes are uninformed too? Yes, luckily for the misinformed middle classes that are planning on voting UKIP, they might get some benefit out of it. (On the other hand, as a left winger it also helps that what they will actually be doing in the case is splitting the Tory vote)

I also make that statement as someone who is working class, who was brought up and still live in a working class area, an area that is (I believe) being targeted by UKIP at the next election.

&gt; I genuinely believe that a lot of this is that UKIP Councillors and MEPs are less stage managed and coached than others. 

That certainly contributes. 

&gt;As a final point a couple of weeks ago Boris Johnson referred to investors from (I think) Hong Kong as, ""oligarchs from the Planet Zog.""[4]   This isn't meaningfully different or worse than Bloom's, ""Bongo Bongo Land"" comment.

I read the article but as you can see it doesn't give a definitive position on either view, just opinion.

Your statement is that the courts *are* incompatible with human rights. However **all** trials in the UK take into account Article 6 of the EHCR so I'm not sure if this can be true. At the end of sentencing the Judge will make a statement saying that a decision has been reached taking Article 6 into consideration. 

Of course the defendant could always appeal to the EHCR if found guilty if they think Article 6 has been breached. Then I guess we'd get a legal decision on 'secret' courts rather than opinion.

* Does not pollute the area.
* Does not cause your tap water to go on fire.
* Does not pollute groundwater
* Drives down the cost of gas
* Drives down the cost of plastics feedstuff
* Saves burning coal to get energy
* Creates lots of skilled jobs

However on the negatives side:

* Does cause the inconvenience of having a building site near some people while it's getting set up. The residual infrastructure is around the size of a house.

And that's it.

I've read down all the highly up-voted comments and see no arguments as to why we would not gleefully frack away. I see a lot of hate toward fracking but I don't see any arguments. 

That we are going to burn a lot of gas is a fact. The choice is whether we take that gas from tankers in Quatar or we dig it out of the ground here. The environmental impact of home-produced gas is clearly lower than importing it.

There is no doubt that in the USA fracking is done differently and has had issues as the techniques were perfected. Using the argument ""it went wrong in the USA"" is not valid or helpful.

We already allow resource extraction under people's homes. There is enough subsidence form old coal mines in residential areas to prove this. And like it or not, the resources under your house belong to the crown and not to you.

[The Royal Society of Engineers did a study and made a set of recommendations as to how to proceed with fracking](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/10266881/Prof-Robert-Mair-Here-are-the-facts-about-fracking.html). Their recommendations have been adopted. In that article you'll note that we already have 2000 on-shore oil wells pumping away including some in sites of great natural beauty and this has been done without any issues.

If you put ""fracking facts"" in to Google the top result is http://www.dangersoffracking.com/ and you can read down that scroll-athon for yourself and see that none of it's arguments hold any water.

I think it must be a protein which is common throughout the Galliform order, as I know that I can't eat Guinea Fowl either. I also couldn't eat Turkey when I was younger and have gotten into the habit of not eating it either, but I have no idea if I can or not, because I've just avoided it for the last 15 years or so. Curiously, Pheasant seems to be fine despite being of the same order as Chicken and Guinea Fowl, so there must be a point at which the genes are different enough to produce proteins which don't set off my overactive immune system. 

It's unfortunate not being able to eat hens eggs because it basically means that outside of my own home I can never eat eggs, but it's downright annoying not being able to eat chicken meat, as that's everywhere and pretty much guaranteed to be served to you on a regular basis outside the home.

In his new book, Harry Redknapp wonders why English managers are becoming extinct. Well, just read the book and you understand why. 

---
Another shocking example of why English managers are becoming extinct is England national team manager Roy Hodgson. http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/roy-hodgson-questions-liverpools-recovery-programme-amid-tension-with-manager-brendan-rodgers-over-raheem-sterling-fitness-9792549.html … 

---
According to Hodgson, there is no evidence that certain players (Sterling/Sturridge) need longer recovery time compared to other players.

---
Firstly, 19-year old players do not have a fully matured body yet. So for them the game demands are higher &amp; will develop much more fatigue. 

---
Young players who develop more fatigue during the game need longer time to get rid of this fatigue otherwise they accumulate fatigue in body

Secondly, Sterling is not only a young but also an explosive player. They have many fast muscle fibres compared to less explosive players. 

---
Fast muscle fibres recover slower compared to slow muscle fibres because less blood &amp; oxygen is running through these fast muscle fibres. 

---
This is why explosive players like Sterling need longer recovery time after a game to get rid of fatigue compared to less explosive player. 

---
If explosive players do not get extra recovery time &amp; are treated in the same way as other players, they accumulate fatigue in their body. 

---
Thirdly accumulation of fatigue due to insufficient recovery makes the nervous system slower. The signal from brain to muscles travel slower 

---
If the signal from the brain arrives later in the muscles this means the brain has less control over body during explosive football actions. 

---
So there's much evidence that insufficient recovery, accumulation of fatigue &amp; slower nervous system are dramatically increasing injury risk

---
England manager Roy Hodgson once again made himself look extremely stupid. He is the perfect example of a typical uneducated English coach. 

---
Roy Hodgson's incompetence must be frustrating for educated managers like Brendan Rodgers who travelled the world. http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29602050 …

Embarrassing to see dinosaur Hodgson questioning the fitness regime of the forward thinking manager Brendan Rodgers. http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/13/raheem-sterling-roy-hodgson-questions-liverpool-training …

George V kept his family business fairly private, partly because one of his sons wasn't born healthy and died at a young age (around 7 iirc) and partly because he was rather shy and retiring. 

Edward VIII was impatient with court protocol, didn't much like his job and was another ""playboy king"" until he met Wallis Simpson and abdicated.

Sorry I didn't reply before about the tree thing too, I'm not sure of the exact rules and if all trees or types of trees are protected, but that could be posed to citizens advice too as they might be able to tell you more about that.

As /u/Proxymoron said the court process can be painful but it's basically the way these sorts of things have to be resolved. In general this is a good thing, too, as we don't live in a country where you can just get someone arrested and held on spurious claims as you can in some places! But unfortunately the court process itself is so much slower and more costly than it would ideally be that it puts people off going through with it.

Anyway definitely try the CAB and then see where you stand after that.

I don't know how much possibility there is that you would be able to take this further given all factors, but consider that *if* there's a strong chance you'd win then the factors such as demolishing the structure would also then be taken into account and I assume they would end up having to pay compensation for that too.

I wonder if any of these ""no win no fee"" lawyers would take a case like this, too. If you wouldn't be able to do it any other way then it could be worth considering taking it to one of them to see. After all they will only go ahead with it if they think they're going to win and make some money out of it for themselves.

Wind and solar are also poor quality resources compared to what we're used to.  Both have very low power densities and thus have large environmental footprints of their own, and neither is well adapted to present demand patterns or grid infrastructure.  Compounding this is the fact that people have expectations of a certain standard of living, which they will not easily relinquish (a fact politicians are well aware of) yet which require large amounts of energy from somewhere.  However they now balk at having to endure any external costs necessary to produce this energy.  Something will have to give.

What appears to be happening is the fact that there is no such thing as free energy is finally coming home to roost.  Confused policy and very poor reporting/understanding of all these issues are also playing a big part in making things better rather than worse.

I think there are other considerations.  Things like residuals and union stuff.  Also, if you bump an extra to a speaking part, how does that affect shooting?  You don't want to burn a take because the background speaking part messed up. Do you hand that off to the second unit?  Does the second unit have time to do it? Depending on shooting schedule you may have to keep that actor for longer (and maybe post production ADR or other things).  So scheduling could become more complicated.  If you don't bump an extra, you then have to cast the part.  If the part is in the script that is how it would be done anyway. That takes some time and resources on the production side as well as the things mentioned above.  Also the person you cast could be at a higher minimum rate (based on experience and previous credits) than a ""random"" speaking role.  

It is a balancing act to what resources the production has and what the story needs. I think in general that less speaking parts there are, the easier the particular production is.

* A ban on night flying.

* Immediately ban causing harm to animals (including but not only primates) in research, testing and education, and invest in the development of alternatives to animal experiments.

* Encourage a new, local and mutual financial sector, based on trust rather than greed, and including community banks, credit unions, local exchange schemes and local currencies.

* Fashion industry ban on size 0 models to reduce pressure on girls to conform to an unhealthy and unrealistic ideal.

&gt; Furthermore, I often read books: I like Dan Brown and can't wait for the next set of Harry Potter's adventures. This makes me clever, if you are too slow to follow my insinuations. Oh, and I can say 'Hello' in Swedish. It's 'Hej', in case you didn't know, you philistine.

This ties in with the image problem, the press likes digestible sound bites and sensation. It does not like to provoke thought and honest discourse. Politicians of all colours know this and also know the press can destroy them through both fair means and foul - see the Tory MP they entrapped and forced to resign.

It is also easy to be against something compared to being for something. Everyone knows UKIP stand against the EU but what do they stand *for*? By contrast the Greens stand for the environment and more income equality.

Farage does have an appeal to certain parts of the electorate, particularly white, elderly, working class and the less educated but this does not translate into enough of an impact to actually win a substantial amount of seats. At most they will win a handful of seats ie. less than 10 probably around 5 (they openly say that they are only targeting 12 seats). 

And yes on certain issues Farage chimes with the public mood because he takes a populist stance on pretty much everything, the recent conference was a perfect example as he openly embraced left wing populism as well as right wing populism.

The thing is UKIP will come under more and more scrutiny as the election draws nearer and people will ask the question, how will you pay for all this, do your sums add up? are you really a party of government? 

As for hard truths on immigration, I don't see how dog whistle politics can possibly be seen as a hard truth. A hard truth is one that is unpalatable to public opinion but is backed up by evidence, you know, the opposite to UKIP's position.

* A three-line whip is a strict instruction to attend and vote, breach of which would normally have serious consequences. Permission not to attend may be given by the whip, but a serious reason is needed.

The occupation proved not only that people have the capacity to act, that we have an individualism and that life doesn't just pass us by decision being made above all, but also it proved that the home was perfectly viable as a home - despite the 'safety' warning from the council. In fact it's fully fitted.

There's your problem.

Jokes aside, have you considered a career in teaching? It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's a good career path. 

Your postgrad qualification will definitely help - An employer/school/college/uni might ask you to do a PTLLS/CTLLS course before you can start delivering but that's relatively straight-forward.

Funny you should mention that ...

I went to Morocco in 1996. I'd heard about Tangier's reputation but I witnessed it first hand. On the ferry over from Spain, me and my girlfriend joined up with a bunch of other people and we agreed to walk in to the town as a group. We had loads of people approach us as soon as we landed, all trying to offer us guidance to our hotels. My girlfriend was a huge fan of literature, so she chose to stay at The Tangerinn where William S. Burroughs wrote the Naked Lunch.

We found our respective hotels on our own, and then met up to explore the city. Eventually a ""student"" wandered up to us, and offered to be our guide. We grudgingly agreed because he wouldn't leave us alone. He toured us through the souqs in the old part of town. We got dragged in to a carpet factory, they divided us up in to smaller groups and didn't let us compare prices. Ended up buying a carpet just to get out of the place.

At the end of the ""tour"", he took us down an alleyway off the main road, divided us again, and then started to demand extortionate amounts of money from us. The guy got really aggressive and nasty at this point.

We paid up, but only an amount that we thought was fair.

Then the good bit happened. He asked me where I was staying, and I told him ""The Tangierinn"".

His eyes lit up and he started asking, ""Do you like big dicks? DO YOU LIKE BIG DICKS?!""

I replied, ""Um ..., I guess it's good if you've got a big one.""

Then he started making kissing noises at me.

Very bizarre.

We left Tangier the next day. Never been back. Even Moroccans call it a shithole.

Imagine the following situation - you have a Scottish MP as the leader of the opposition, they win a majority in the UK at large, but not in England. So, then, you would have a Prime Minister representing the whole country, and a separate English First Minister, from a different party, representing 85% of the country, with control over major swathes of policy. It would be an impossible situation politically, and a constitutional nightmare. If we're going to have a federal system, create a proper system, not some crippled mutant.

Edit: In fact, it would undermine any Scottish MP as Prime Minister - he wouldn't even be able to vote on half of government policy. Likewise half the cabinet could not be Scottish, because they deal with English-only affairs. So would we then have two cabinets, or would the 'British' cabinet be half actually British, and half English-only? In which case the British government would hard to distinguish from the English government.

Do you think Gunmen who have no problem attacking the Pakistan Airforce Bases in Karachi - the commercial capital - are going to stop just in Quetta? These are the terms for assylum:

""To be recognised as a refugee, you must:

    have left the country you’re a national of or, if you’re stateless, the country you usually live in
    be unable to go back because you fear persecution
    be unable to live safely in another part of the country you left
    have failed to get protection from authorities in the country you left

This persecution must be because of your:

    race
    religion
    nationality
    political opinion
    membership of a particular social group that puts you at risk because of the social, cultural, religious or political situation in your country - eg your gender, gender identity, sexual orientation""

1) MPs?
Should the nationalist party's be included? The SNP are the third largest party in the UK and could argue that being excluded would unfairly damage their electoral chances. Also which green party? the Green party of England and Wales or the Green party of Scotland, they have different policies.

2)Polls?
Which polls? They change all the time and would it make sense to rank ukip higher than the lib dems when they have many many more MPs.

3) People with a chance of being prime minister?

4) projected MPs?

5) party size?

6) past electoral performance?

My personal preference is either for 5 or 2, probably both debates on separate nights. The point I am making though is that it is not an easy decision to make on who is in and who is out. To argue that there is no reasonable way in which UKIP could be included and the greens excluded ergo it is media conspiracy is ridiculous. On all 6 ways to judge UKIP are either equal to or ahead of the greens, especially polls and projected MPs.

Personally I want to see them included because they still do have substantial support in the country and do represent a quite different view from the others and have signed petitions in support of them being on. At the end of the day though the people that organize these debates have to draw a line somewhere, it was a shame that the Greens were on the wrong side of it and I hope we can get them to redraw it but I can still respect that it was a tough call.

I actually support that amendment and for good reason - it's simply democratic for a small minority of the electorate to impose deep and enduring constitutional change upon a majority without their consent.

I can appreciate why people might feel hard done by but imposing constitutional change like that is simply wrong and I'm sure that you don't *really* support that.

The fact is that a majority of Scots did not back the proposals for a Scottish Assembly, much like a majority of Scots did not back separation from the United Kingdom.

Let's not forget the rest of the story however, namely that the SNP then withdrew their support for Labour after the Assembly referendum and voted *with Margaret Thatcher* to bring down the government in a confidence motion and ensured that the Conservatives came to power.
