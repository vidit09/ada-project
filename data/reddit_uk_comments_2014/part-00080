true,Furthur_slimeking,lfc99,,"Sure, I'm still buzzing, but it doesn't change how I feel about our chances in the league.

  I was always one of the optimistic ones. I don't believe in ""jinxing"" results or any such nonsense. The title is by no means a certainty, but we are the form team at the moment. We are the best team in the league right now and we have every chance of winning it. City WILL drop points. Chelsea will drop points. I think we have the beating of both of them and, at the moment, we actually look undefeatable.

  I've thought since before Christmas that the title was a possibility. The closer to the end of the season we've got, the more likely it's looked. I wouldn't go so far as to say ""it's ours to lose"", because City are still in the driving seat, but I'm expecting us to stay in the race until the bitter end. Maybe we'll win it. 

  It's a fantastic feeling. We fear no-one, and I suspect other teams are shitting themselves at the prospect of facing us. We can beat every other team in the league, and we should beat every other team in the league simply because we have more fire-power than them. The defensive solidity recently comes at the perfect time, but it's less of an issue than it would have been in previous campaigns. We can score more goals than everyone else, which is why defeat is something which is only a distant memory for us.

The rest of the team were pretty mediocre, although i must say that the makeshift defence did a pretty good job(dare i say better than we usually look like in defence :)

I don't drink the Bentaleb kool-aid. He is overrated, but still a very good talent. I feel like he needs to find out what position he wants to excell in. Because right now i feel like he is a jack of all trades and master of none and i dont think he is good enough to be that kinda player.

Im glad that lennon finally showed som kinda end product, even though he needed a lot of tries before that one assist to assist :D

The only player that really gave a right out bad performance was Townsend. It's just not working for him at all and he needs to be benched and hopefully come back stronger.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"Thing with the championship shout is....we were never going to have Bale, between the world record bid and him wanting to do to Real we never really had a shot to keep him. Just like Modders. Bale want to leave and as much as he may have loved playing for Harry he sure as hell loved playing for AVB.  Once Real starting tapping him up it was over.

So yes the league would have been in transition (and as we are seeing City and Chelsea are still rising to the top through great coaching and bottomless spending) but the group of players that worked so well together under Harry was falling apart. Parker was aging quickly, Gallas needed to move on, Ledley retired, VDV went to Germany (in an attempt to save his marriage i believe which Harry wouldn't have been able to talk him out of, though it still failed), Modders wanted to go to Real, Crouchie we thankfully moved on, and then Bale moved. The players we brought in may have differed, but considering Harry's admiration for the likes of Joe Cole, Charlie Adam and Stuart Downing i am hesitant to say they would have been any better, maybe they would be but maybe they wouldn't be, Harry has missed on as many players as he has hit.

The team that Harry had success with through man-management and self belief was transitioning on. Not saying self-belief isn't important but looking at the sides in the league...transition or not we were always going to be behind Chelsea and City for a title race and would still be in the mix with LFC and Arsenal, but they are better managed.

I like Harry and what he did deserves credit, but i think we would have always settled into the 5 spot, maybe the race would have been closer but we still would be in the 5 slot given the way the other teams are playing. Harry has never shown an ability to guide a team to a title, if he had i imagine that it wouldn't be Hodgson as the England manager.

We do need to make a change in management ""blood and thunder"" as Tim phrased it isn't going to be enough to move us back up the table but a sense of how to beat another team may. ",0,1395348224,null,0,false,0,cg7p27k,t3_20w7go,t1_cg7p27k,t1_cg7nxq1,null,1432995545,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

For what it's worth, here's an alternative interpretation of the whole situation which I found on HUKD:

&gt;Think about this calmly for a minute.
&gt;
&gt;If this is true, OVIVO was not getting the service from Cognatel that they were supposed to be getting. I doubt the OVIVO business model would work unless they can uniquely identify each user for marketing purposes. Cognatel did not provide the software to OVIVO that they were contracted to.
&gt;
OVIVO withheld payment to try to get the software that they needed and Cognatel cut off their services. Cognatel are at fault. They are the ones that are not fulfilling their obligations and broke the chain.
&gt;
This sounds to me that OVIVO were put in a position that was completely unworkable. If those were the circumstances that were 'out of our control', they then were basically forced out of the market by Vodafone's partner.
&gt;
If this is true, I think this is exceptionally sad. People are going to say that this business model doesn't work, when it was never proven. They just had the is fortune of having Cognatel as service provider.
&gt;
They had an opportunity to really change the way the mobile phone market works, which would have benefited everyone, including the mobile phone companies.
&gt;
It offers them another revenue stream which could of allowed them to offer more unlimited packages. In countries where they offer more unlimited packages, they are struggling to make enough money to maintain their networks. This would have been a fantastic work around.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; But don't you find it in the least bit disgraceful that a woman didn't get emergency treatment because she was concerned about the costs? A woman walked around with a dead baby inside of her for days because she couldn't afford the necessary treatments.

Well no, because I don't think we are in full possession of the facts here. 

It's my understanding that she could have had the treatment *if she wanted*, but would have had to reimburse the NHS afterwords and rightly so - when we have so much austerity and cutbacks we can't exactly be offering a free for all to the rest of the world.

The woman claimed that neither she nor her husband could afford to pay it back so she elected not to have the treatment so as not to prejudice her prospective application for a spousal visa which would be denied if she owed more than £1,000 to the NHS.

Where the story breaks down is when you consider that under the current immigration rules, a British national must earn *at least* £18,600 in order to sponsor a spousal visa for a non-EU national.

I find it difficult to believe that on that sort of salary they could afford to pay for the spousal visa (which is in the 4-figure range when it comes to costs), flights for the foreign spouse to come to the UK and money each month to suppose the foreign spouse until they are legally allowed to work but could not first find the £1,500 to bring the debt to the NHS down?

true,BikerBoon,UnionFlag,'81 Honda CB 250RS,"If you can afford cash outright, cash is king. When you take out a loan for a bike you'll be paying around 15% APR for it. You're right, buying new is a bad deal because you can wipe off a huge chunk of the value by rolling it off the showroom floor. There are bikes that hold their resale value extremely well however, in the case of your Ninja 300 it'd depreciate faster than a prostitute drops her knickers. Your friend appears to have a good deal, but how many monthly payments of ""just £90"" is he making? 12, 18, 24, 36? Regardless, if he could have afforded it he would have saved a fair whack paying cash.

With hire purchase, the finance company owns the bike. You miss payments, they take the bike away. Personally, I think you'll struggle to find a really good finance deal on a used bike, often the best deals come with new bikes because people see the ""monthly"" cost and forget about the overall massive sum they are paying. There are however a few companies that spring to mind when it comes to doing used vehicle loans, black horse finance springs to mind.

Examining the three possibilities:

Possibility 1: You buy the bike (£3K) on a 15% APR hire purchase agreement over the course of a year, (both figures for sake of argument, actual interest rates will depend on your credit rating etc, and the 1 year figure makes working out interest easy).

You would pay back £3450 in total. You're down £450.

Possibility 2: You pay cash outright, and everything in life goes fine. You've saved yourself £450 than if you had taken out the hire purchase agreement.

Possibility 3: You pay cash and an emergency arises, eg, your roof needs retiling and it costs £3K. You borrow the money you would have spent on the bike. I'll assume the emergency goes on a credit card, which is going to be slightly more expensive than the bike loan because it isn't secured against an asset. A typical card APR would be about 20%, so borrowing on this would cost you £600 for the year. You're £150 worse off than if you had bought the bike on a hire purchase. 

Basically paying cash is a slight gamble, you're either going to save yourself £450 or lose £150 over getting it on hire purchase. If you're pretty confident that no £3K emergency could ever crop up, this is certainly the best option. There's something to be said for it being ""your"" bike as well.

TL;DR: If you're fairly confident you aren't going to need the money for anything else, pay cash. To make a proper comparison you'd really need to give us the APR figures on your HPA quote and credit card.

true,kde01,king,,"Are we talking about the same player?

&gt; I don't really think his off the ball movement is anything special.  I also feel like he dwells too long on the ball...

As soon as he passes the ball, he moves into open space to receive a pass back. He passes almost instantly every time, rarely taking the ball and running with it. He's a distributor, not the kind of player that takes the ball and makes runs like Holtby or Dembele.

&gt; but i don't think we will get fourth with him in the center anytime soon. 

Which of our CMs would you rather play than him? He's been better than Paulinho, and a *hell* of a lot cheaper. He's not as good Dembele, but he doesn't need to be - he's a different sort of player. He's a holding midfielder, while Dembele is box-to-box. Both can coexist together effectively. 

&gt; He was abysmal the first 75min, but really good the last 15min...

As was the entire team. Bentaleb was a bright spot the first 75 minutes. He's not the kind of player you can watch a highlight reel with techno music and be entertained. You really need to pay attention to how he plays the ball and moves every time. He gives not only our back line but our midfield an outlet to pass the ball to. He's always getting open and giving his teammates an option when they get closed down, and he makes the pass to open up the opposing team. It helps us keep positive possession, instead of the passing between the CBs and CDM we always saw with AVB. Sure, he'll pass sideways 9 times for every forward pass but those 10 passes happen very quickly and can help us keep positive possession and pressure.

In all honesty, I would play him in at least half of our matches next season. He's progressing well and getting better every match. He's a smart player that makes quick decisions and never gives up. We need him on so many levels. I know a lot here want Capoue back and hate that Tim keeps playing Bentaleb but I would take Bentaleb over Capoue. Capoue had a couple good matches against lower sides an then faded, while Bentaleb has been a staple of the side and only getting better.",0,1395350909,null,0,false,0,cg7qe21,t3_20xjfv,t1_cg7qe21,t1_cg7p8ia,null,1432996170,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; you can't seriously be telling me that the entire financial world isn't investing in something because they haven't heard of it yet

I didn't say they hadn't heard of it.  These are people who have worked in the traditional financial sector for years.  I'm saying that bitcoin is a black swan event; the like of it has not been seen before.  I don't expect them all to take one look at it and instantly throw away everything they've understood and worked with for years -- is that seriously what you expect?  Is that what you would use as the measure of success?  An instant replacement of the entire infrastructure that we've all been using for years?  Of course that's not what's happening.  Changes like this take time.

&gt; when was the last time the US dollar or the euro dropped to a tenth of its value because a magic: the gathering website went offline? 

Two things:

 - the reliability of bitcoin the protocol, bitcoin the network, is completely different from the volatility of the price.  Bitcoin the protocol has never once failed, no transfer has ever gone through and it has not lost track of a single fraction.

 - You're using the price on the exchange that went bankrupt (something which was anticipated for the last year) as the measure of price collapsing.  Have you looked at the price on the other exchanges (at that point carrying the vast majority of the volume) at the same time as the mt.gox collapse?  They barely blinked.  That's quite different from ""dropped to a tenth"".

&gt; and we're talking about bitcoin, which has a low adoption rate. It's 100% relevant here, and though you're very clever for spotting this isn't exclusively true for bitcoin that doesn't mean it excuses bitcoin in any way.

""Excuses""?  I don't get what about it you think needs excusing.  It is a property of bitcoin at the moment, you can't say ""bitcoin is incapable of working as a currency at 100% adoption because it is volatile at 1% adoption"".

&gt; If your car insurance costs $10,000 a year and they tell you it's because they have low adoption and all the other customers are shitty, do you swap to the large $400 a year company or do you stick with them and hope more people use your insurer?

That's hardly a similar comparison.  Car insurance is not a currency.

Bitcoin adoption is more likely the more stable it is.  Bitcoin adoption is slowly increasing, as it slowly increases it becomes more stable. Hence bitcoin adoption is more likely.  Making it more stable.  It's a virtuous circle, and at each level of adoption it becomes more attractive to the next set of people who required a slightly higher level of stability.  It's not stable enough for you when it's volatility is 50% -- fine, but it's a marginal property, for some it is acceptable, making volatility 49%, making it suddenly acceptable for a few more, making volatility 48%, and so on.

&gt; Again, you seem to think that by telling me bitcoin doesn't have many users you're going to convince me all the problems don't matter. 

No, you're telling me its problems, and I'm saying that those problems are entirely due to adoption, not fundamental.  That is something that fixes itself given time.  Those problems matter to you, right now.  Fine.  But that's not a reasonable argument for why bitcoin is not workable at all.

I'm not arguing the problems away; I'm saying they are not inherent in bitcoin, they are inherent in bitcoin's low adoption.  That is not something that bitcoin itself has any control over.  What we should be interested in to find out if it is a viable currency is if it is viable once adopted, if the feedback loop is one that makes it less stable as adoption increases, or more stable.

&gt; why do I care about that?

I said ""for merchants"".  If you aren't a merchant, then you don't care. Fine.

&gt; Companies use bitcoin because customers will complain if they don't.

What customers?  You said nobody wants bitcoin -- which was my fundamental objection to your case.  You have shifted ground to a discussion of other problems you see in bitcoin.  Those, I can completely understand, and they are far more reasonable objections (if subjective rather than objective).",0,1395351397,null,0,false,0,cg7qmib,t3_20w0qr,t1_cg7qmib,t1_cg7m89n,null,1432996285,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

He did well that last 10 minutes, and I really think he deserves more time. He's the kind of player that we need more of up front. He is very intelligent. Did you see his header? That was pinpoint accurate at the side of the bar. Oblak was in a super position to grab that. The goals he's scored from open play show that, too. He's very intelligent with his movement, positioning, passing, and ball play. Does everyone already forget those two amazing through balls to Bale that are still making the rounds in highlight reals? 

I would love to see Gylfi as a LAM in a 4-1-4-1:

Lloris, Walker, Kaboul, Vertonghen, Rose; Sandro; Townsend, Gylfi, Eriksen, Chadli; Adebayor.

Gylfi and Ade complement each other well, as do Eriksen and Gylfi. I think Gylfi could really strive in that setup. Not just Gylfi, but Eriksen would do well with the area Chadli's left sides runs would open up as well as the through balls Gylfi can provide. Ade would thrive off Gylfi and Eriksen's vision, as well as the crosses that would be raining in off both left and right.

Why is that a problem?  Bitcoin is a new currency, and the market is trying to discover price.  Which it did.  News of adoption in China drove price up; news of Chinese regulation drove it down a bit.  Bitcoin is not living in a static world.

As I've said to the other responder, I am not saying that these price changes aren't happening, I'm saying they are a property of bitcoin's currently small market share.  Bitcoin can't go from 0% to 100% adoption overnight, so there are growing pains.  What's important as to whether it's workable, is whether it gets more stable as adoption increases -- well it does.  That means the feedback loop is a stabilising one.  More stability equals more users equals more stability.

At Valencia, every ball went through him by way of a beautiful volley or header into the net. That's the kind of player he is. I refuse to believe that he was brought in under the assumption that he would link up with the midfield, dribble past the back four and slot it into the goal.

[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBHnymaOBe4&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=68)

Do you think this goal is an accident? Hint: It isn't. Throughout that video, every goal is the same. He doesn't try to beat his man. He simply receives the ball and scores with his first, or in some places second, touch, and it is absolutely *magnificent*. Under AVB, we had nobody who could put the ball into the penalty box and the result was that Bobby got isolated, unable to work his one touch-magic. 

In addition to that, I don't think he's had a great couple of months. He's in a country where he doesn't really speak the language. His wife had a miscarriage a while back. He's been out of form for so long that he barely remembers how it feels to score a goal, and when he finally does, he spends the following two weeks on the bench.

Spurs could easily have said to Bale: Give us one more season to prepare for life without you and then you can leave. That's what Man Utd did with Ronaldo. Bale would have accepted that. He is after all a decent guy and at his age it would have been a reasonable request to make.

Redknapp's only spent three years of his career at a top club managing a whole group of world class players and that was at Spurs. In his other jobs he's had top players but never had an opportunities to build anything close to a title-winning team, so I think it's unfair to compare him to managers who've spent many years at the highest level. It's worth remembering that he only got the job at Spurs because Levy was desperate to avoid relegation. Redknapp has been overlooked for a lot of top job because of his reputation as a wheeler dealer.

You say we need to move on from ""blood and thunder"" but what is the alternative? A foreign coach like Ramos or AVB with a technical director like Commoli or Baldini? It sounds great in theory but in practice it leaves us lagging way behind Arsenal and other clubs who have better players and are comfortable playing against continental style football. Redknapp's approach of fast, attacking football upset the best of teams. We currently seem to be trying to be Chelsea-lite but with inferior players. Slow football that is often painful to watch and easy to defend against. Levy has again lurched from one extreme to another with the appointment of Sherwood but the problem is he's got no experience.

What are you on? I have never seen any Benfica fan who thinks so arrogantly. I'm embarrassed to read that as a Benfica fan myself!

----------

Anyway, I'm a Benfica fan who lives in London. I was at WHL for the first leg.

All I have to say is that what happened in the last 20 minutes of the match is what I was fearing would happen based on the lineup we went with.

Not counting the defense, everyone else was second choice. Players like Andre Gomes and Djuricic are pretty much third or fourth choice and barely get a sniff of game-time in the league. 

The two goals by Spurs were badly conceeded by us, Luisao should not have been trying to win a header so high up the pitch for the first goal, and IMO the second Chadli goal was offside.

But once Spurs had that momentum, they were all over us. If Soldado had scored from his earlier chance, I really think Spurs would have become favourites to go through because Benfica barely threatened your makeshift defence, despite all the possession.

Anyway.

I'm sorry but there hasn't been an increase in funding overall as it needs to increase by about 4% every year but has been increased lower than that.

[It also looks like there will be further cuts in comparison to other areas with a new tariff system  implemented](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/mar/12/mental-health-funding-changes-lives-risk).

My local physio department has 6 treatment bays for 6 physiotherapists to work, but now they can only afford 3 physios to work there. I know this from speaking to the head of the department.

&gt; Since the NHS was founded in 1948, its spending has increased on average by 4% a year in real terms.

Yet for the first time the NHS was asked [to make £20bn in savings](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9568068/Patient-care-will-suffer-under-budget-cuts-warn-NHS-finance-bosses.html) (which means cuts). [The National Audit Office questioned these cuts](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9741705/NHS-cuts-may-not-be-sustainable-says-spending-watchdog.html) when first announced in 2012.

Remember that Cameron's big pledge was ""I'll cut the deficit, not the NHS"" but not reducing the funding in line with population needs leads to cuts in services. Yes, the funding may be a bit more than what it was last year, but it's a cut to the amount it needs to increase by, what with a quickly aging population and longer life expectancies. Labour never mentioned lowering funding for the NHS and have always been against this policy. [The previous government increased spending per capita on NHS services in England from £1,287 in 2003/04 to £1,979 in 2010/11](http://www.nhsconfed.org/priorities/political-engagement/Pages/NHS-statistics.aspx).",0,1395356604,null,0,false,0,cg7t1rw,t3_20ugmm,t1_cg7t1rw,t1_cg7qwip,null,1432997423,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt; A heavily pregnant immigrant thought to be carrying a dead, unborn child **was too afraid to seek medical help** in the UK after being told she would have to pay the NHS thousands of pounds to remove the foetus, the High Court has heard.

£2500 according to the article, to be owed to the NHS after the treatment.

&gt; The woman, who could not afford to pay and whose visitor's visa was due to expire, feared she would not get a new visa to return to the UK to live with her husband if **she owed the NHS money for treatment** under new immigration rules designed to deter ""health tourists"".

Well, maybe the husband could help with the bill somehow. I surely would do whatever I could to help my wife.

&gt; A judge heard **she had declined treatment** ""in the hope that the foetus would, as she put it, come out naturally"".

&gt; Mr Hundt also described how a woman had met a British man in her country of origin, fallen pregnant and come to the UK on a six-month visitor's visa.

&gt; Mr Hundt said **she refused treatment because she wanted to travel back to her own country** in order to apply for a two-year wife's visa to live with her husband in Britain.

&gt; Mr Hundt stated: ""She knew that **she would not get a visa if she owed money to the NHS** for this treatment, and she could not pay for - nor could her husband.""

&gt; He said **she ""did not know what to do"", and he had directed her to an international relief charity** which ran a clinic staffed by volunteer clinicians.

&gt;**He then lost contact with her.**

I'm sorry but I can't see how they did anything wrong. She chose not to be treated. They tried to help as much as they could.

Personally I would get my wife to the hospital, make sure she's well, and worry about the consequences later. If it happened that she was denied a visa because of the debt to the NHS, I would do my best to pay it off as soon as possible so I could be reunited with my wife.

As for the reset? Yes, Eleven himself calls it a ""reset"" and a ""new cycle"" in the episode.  There are a few fans who argue that it was just one, because Ten used the term ""regeneration cycle"" to refer to the regeneration process, but there's really nothing to indicate that's the case.

He's the Twelfth Doctor. The War Doctor is an external name for the purpose of the show; the character himself rejected the name ""Doctor"" except for  a few moments at the end of his life (which he was unable to remember for the next few regenerations). The Meta-crisis Doctor consumed a regeneration in his creation and called himself the Doctor, but was a new and separate entity from the Doctor.

1. Consider a group of death. If a big club gets knocked out because of it, they're suddenly losing a massive chunk of money that they're used to getting. The Europa League allows them to recoup some of the money, assuming they're willing to put in the work.

2. The Europa League isn't actually that interesting. Look at the teams that get into it. Other than 3 or 4 clubs, the majority are pretty small in comparison to those 3 or 4. Bringing in clubs from the Champions League gives the 3 or 4 a challenge, and the little clubs the chance to fight one of the biggest teams in Europe.

3. Money does talk.

With ATMs, the reason why you can withdraw from any banks one, and this is really simplified too, is that you're actually drawing from a suspense account. Think of it as a temporary bank account, which the bank has to balance every working day. You take money from the account, and the system makes a note of your card number. At the end of the day, the bank then claims the money from your bank (if it's a small enough amount, then that's the only time it's checked, which is why you can still use your debit card for small things when you're overdrawn), and ticks off your details if they get the money back.

true,4thDimensi0n,null,null,"Benfica fan here. First off, nice game and well played. 

Moving on. From the defense onwards we fielded 5 guys that aren't usually on our starting eleven. So, as much as Spurs played with their reserves, we didn't play both legs with our usual starting eleven.

Ruben Amorim, André Gomes, Sulejmani, Djuricic and Cardozo haven't been starters. We usually field, Fejsa - Enzo Pérez and then; Gaitán, Markovic and Rodrigo.


It has been said by the club that we're clearly prioritizing the League while rotating the squad for the other 3 competitions we're still in. Mostly because last year at the end of April we were ahead of the Portuguese League until the 29th game (League has 30 games), we went to the Portuguese Cup final and the EL final. We lost everything in May. We managed to lose the League where we had 5 points of advantage to Porto with one loss only (and it was against Porto).


This year, history repeats itself, it's the end of March and we're now qualified to the EL quarters, Portuguese Cup semi-finals, Portuguese League Cup semi-finals and first of the League with 5 points clear of Sporting (2nd) and 12 points ahead of Porto (3rd).


So, believe me, we did field many of our reserve players and we were complacent as fuck. Benfica hasn't lost since we faced Olympiakos in the group stage of the CL. That was 5 months ago. 


All this to say, what you did this afternoon and with regard on your latest form, you should be proud. There aren't many teams that can come to Estádio da Luz and give us hell like you did for those 15-20 minutes.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"There was a difference between Suarez and Bale though, the offer and where it was coming from.

LFC recieved 1 offer, £40,000,001 from Arsenal who is a league rival.  Now they turned down that offer (and it now comes to light that they ignored the release clause, which is odd because the players association and FA looked at it and said there was no clause. Regardless good for LFC) not only because they wanted to keep him but because it didn't meet their valuation.  During that whole fiasco the number coming up was anywhere between £50m - £60m that they wanted for Suarez. Arsenal offered £40m which is far below the valuation that LFC had on the Suarez.  

On the other hand were offered £86m, a world record transfer fee, from outside the league. We turned down more money for Modders than we ended up receiving from Real from Chelsea because they were in the league. 

The simple fact that Arsenal were in the league (not to mention tried to be cheap) makes the decision a whole lot different than Bale. If our only offer for Bale had come from Chelsea/City/United it may be a different story. But the offer came from outside the league and a team that worked their ass off to convince Bale to leave, so we sold him for a world record fee.  I have less issue with the Bale move then the Modric move, as i think we let him go on the cheap (and the fact that we still haven't truly replaced him).

See, i think the continental manager and DoF can work in England, City use a form of the set up (they have more money than they know what to do with so any setup will work) and so do LFC. When FSG first bought LFC the first thing they did was seek out a ""soccernomics"" DoF, Comoli was the first name that came up (i still have no idea how they looked at some of his spectacular misses and jumped at him), Ian Ayre is now the de-facto DoF for LFC. Its not as if the setup can't work in England, it works in Italy, Spain, France, Netherlands, Portugal and Germany just because the PL is big doesn't mean the same principles that are driving the other major leagues won't translate. It has less to do with budget than it does implementation, the really successful teams that employ DoF's don't rely on budget, they rely on scouting to identify talent, usually young talent for the club to develop and then sell.

The issue with the DoF not working for us has partially been that we have very, very poorly chosen managers and partially because we have no actual ideology at the club.

AVB and Ramos (remember getting Ramos was a coup at the time) were both highly touted up and comers and both were ill-suited to work in England. We keep going from ""highly-touted"" to old style English and then back and then back again which leads to our team being a hodgepodge of talent of varying styles. But we don't stick with a style, we have no idelogy the only thing that matter on the pitch seem to be ""attacking football"" not what style it is which affects the performance and the tactics of whatever manager we happen to have at the moment.  We for once should not look for the ""up and coming"" manager, but the established ""A-list"" manager. It could still crash and burn but the odds are much better that there is success.

One of the truly appealing things about getting someone like LvG is that the man preaches philosophy and expects it to be rolled out from top to bottom. LvG would potentially be able to do what we haven't been able to do under ENIC...create an identiy for the club beyond ""try hards"".  This makes everything else easier, you can trim the squad of players who don't fit the system, Baldini can narrow the players he tries to sign, Broomfield narrows the type of player that he puts a priority on scouting, when LvG leaves (figure regardless of where he signs it will be 2-3 years) you can identify a manager to replace him quicker. Everything works cleaner. 

I think Levy has the right idea to modernize Spurs into the DoF/Head coach model. We have just executed it very poorly. We have been missing an identity as a club and have continually chosen divergent paths in our management (and chosen for the most part very badly). Currently we have a highly regarded top notch DoF, if we can pair him with a top notch manager we can actually build on what we have in house and improve.",0,1395361726,null,0,false,0,cg7va36,t3_20w7go,t1_cg7va36,t1_cg7snqj,null,1432998476,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

There are some good reasons that the 3rd placed teams in CL are going into the EL. You have given the money reasons and that the EL benefits from bigger and better clubs. I bet Swansea would rather meet Napoli than some obscure russian team.

Furthermore you make the CL more interesting when you also get something when being 3rd. A lot of CL teams are fighting to the end to get into the europa league by being 3rd in their group.

chadli however isn't the quickest, however he has a great right foot. he can cross the ball with accuracy, he can shot with power, or place it, he can pass the ball, he has the ability to play quick one-touch passes.

i think the fact that he isn't a ""fly down the byline"" winger means people think that when andros flies down the wing he is playing well but in reality nothing really comes off it. chadli however has the technical ability to be able to bring himself and others into it while continuing the forward chance, if that makes sense.

I'm fine with us playing Bentaleb when we don't have any better options. If i could choose id go with someone like Sandro whos better defensively. Bentaleb could be a good DM if he gets the right coaching. 

Being an outlet is pretty much every defensive midfielders job, its pretty standard. Recycling possesion isnt that special. I just don't see how Bentaleb is so special that he should be played every game.

No one under the age of 50 in the UK has been asked whether they want to 'join' or stay in the EU. Ever. I want my say on how my country is run.

""how do you think it doesn't have the potential to send us straight back into a recession? ""

How do you think it has the potential to send us into recession?

As far as i can see, the only reason i can find which europhiles put forward is "" OUR TRADE WILL COLLAPSE!!!!!"" which is impossible as part Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, the one which states any nation can leave when it wants, also states that the EU has to grant an immediate free trade agreement with said country. All the UK's non-EU trade agreements will still be intact if we left also.

This would mean, instead of our trade been diverted through the EU (which artificially inflates our 'trade with the EU figure up to 50% when in fact it is far, far lower) it can go straight from the UK to our trade partners, and our trade can grow without the EU middle man.

If we left we could make our own trade agreements. Hell, we could even try to rebuild the trade network we had with the Commonwealth countries, which would be a huge boon to all nations in there.

As far as i can see, leaving the EU has far more positives than staying in.",0,1395364197,null,0,false,0,cg7wctj,t3_20vxcy,t1_cg7wctj,t1_cg7w6mz,null,1432999053,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

They lied, they cheat, they went back on promise after promise.

true,ReflexMan,null,null,"Piggy backing onto this to pose some similar questions about time travel in Misfits.

It seems to me that the writers just have no idea how to write time travel. I know that sounds a bit mean, and as time travel is impossible, so saying that it is being done ""wrong"" is weird, but typically, it seems like you can write time travel one of two ways (the past is unchangeable, and if you go back and try to change something, you will either fail inexplicably or end up being the cause of the event you meant to stop. vs. the past is changeable, and when you return to the present, the present will be different). Within each of those ways, there are rules that tend to make it make more sense.

It seems like every time travel event in Misfits has something that makes no sense, even by TV time travel standards.

First, the episode where Curtis goes back in time multiple times to change what happened the night he was arrested. He changes it many times, one time seeing how it would affect the present (him not being there means they all died (except Nathan, which was a cool bit of foreshadowing) because he wasn't there to rewind time in the first episode). In the end, he ends up fixing it so that Sam doesn't go to prison, and they don't break up. Because of that, when he snaps back to the present, she is still his girlfriend, which makes sense. What DOESN'T make sense is that Alisha and Curtis are together. I get that it might seem right to only have modified the one thing (""Sam and Curtis stay together"") when fast forwarding, but it would only happen this way if the new timeline Curtis, who is essentially autopilot as far as the audience is concerned, got together with Alisha despite being with Sam. They don't just both happen. The show kind of implies that it was just a quirk of time, but it would rely on Curtis making that decision. Granted, the version of Curtis whose narrative we see wouldn't have actively made that choice, but some Curtis would have. If that makes sense.

Second, the episode where they all become famous and the lactomancer kills everyone. Curtis turns back time to before they were famous, and the gang goes and beats up the milk guy, presumably making it so that he doesn't become famous or something, and they don't either. The problem is that for the rest of the series, everyone refers to that time as if it had happened. True, Curtis could have told them all the details instead of just saying that shit went down, but people continually refer back to the guy with the milk who went psycho as if it happened. I get the impression the writers forgot that was a history which was deleted, but just remember doing that episode and the events of it, calling back to it. Similarly, when Alisha meets future Simon, she finds and watches a tape of the gang being famous and interviewed, something which would later happen in the events of the milk episode, but because those events got overridden, the future in which Simon time travels to the past would not have been one where that tape exists. So the question remains: How in the world does Simon have that tape from an alternate past which doesn't exist?

Third, and this isn't so much a problem with logic so much as it is just weird judgment on the writers' parts. Season 2's entire arc is about Simon as superhoodie. It builds up over the whole season, and finally, in the finale, Simon finds out that superhoodie is Simon in the future. Alisha reveals this to him. But again, this is the milk episode whose events were overridden. Because of that, at the end of the season, Simon doesn't know that superhoodie is him. The time between that finale and the christmas special is somewhat large, so it makes sense to assume that Alisha tells Simon that superhoodie is him sometime during that gap. So explaining how Simon knows during the special is easy enough. It's just weird to do it like that. They build it up this whole time, then have him find out in an episode which essentially gets deleted, but then they use the footage of him finding out in the ""previously on Misfits"" thing, as if that is how he found out, when it really isn't. Essentially, I just think it's weird to have him find out and then take that away, and then just imply that he finds out at some point, without showing it. In essence, we never see the real Simon find out.

Fourth, the nazi episode. The old man goes back in time from the normal present to kill Hitler, ends up giving Hitler his phone, leading his return to be to a new present where the Nazis are still in power. The whole episode takes place here. So the characters in this episode are different. They aren't the same Simon, Kelly, Alisha, etc that we know. They are alternate versions who have always lived in THIS NAZI timeline. So when, at the end, Kelly goes back in time to take the phone back from Hitler, she returns to the normal present again. BUT WAIT. This is now the Nazi timeline Kelly. This Kelly should have no memory of the original timeline. Whereas the other members of the gang are normal, this Kelly fast forwarded to fill her own body at the present, but she won't have the memories of ""normal"" Kelly's life. She will have the memories of ""Nazi Kelly's"" life. But the show pretends that she is normal Kelly, who temporarily went to the Nazi timeline to fight Nazis, and then returned. She frequently makes mention of the time she went to fight Nazis, but that's not how it was. She should be weirded out by the timeline which is different to her.

Fifth, the whole arc with Simon as superhoodie. This one is a character choice rather than a timeline mistake, but still. Simon knows the history of superhoodie, that it's future Simon coming to the past to save Alisha from dying to the video game guy, thus ensuring that she falls in love with past Simon, who will then turn into future Simon, go back in time, and do it all over again. I get that. The issue is that when Alisha dies, Simon suddenly realizes that this is when he is meant to go back, but why?! The whole point of him going back and dying was to save her, but because he now knows that she dies like 10 days later (exaggeration) anyway, why would he go back in time to die just to prolong her life by such a short time? If he chose to stay in the present and never go back (obviously, he could always just go back the next day, meaning time wouldn't instantly change, but if we assume that there was a point in time when it was ""now or never"" and Simon chose ""never"", then time would instantly change based on that decision), then the past would change. Simon wouldn't have gone back in time, so Alisha would have died sooner, not fallen in love with Simon, and he would presumably be more timid. But he would still be alive. She is dead either way, but he would be alive. I guess I just don't understand why he feels that her death is the catalyst in him going back in time to save her. The only logic I can think of is that he feels being with Alisha for like 2 days would be worth dying, so he goes back so he can be with her for a short time before dying. Maybe that's it, or maybe he just doesn't realize saving her is pointless when he knows the future.

Sixth and final, the finale. The dude sends Jess into the future by a year, and the whole episode takes place in that time. At the end, she makes him send her back by slitting her wrists, essentially threatening to die. So she gets sent back, but wait, she has a phone message for herself, so that past Jess will know how to change history. Bu-whaaaaat? She sent a video message to her own phone in the past? What the fuck? Did the writers write that episode on drugs? Also worthy of note here is that she basically doesn't feel anything for the baby all episode long, because it is the bad guy's baby, and because she is just given this baby after the fact, as opposed to giving birth to it and getting to know it. So she doesn't really care for the baby and has no reason to. But the message she sends herself says that she needs to make sure the bad guy gets her pregnant so she will still have the baby. Why? Why does she suddenly care about this baby? Why does it have to be that baby with that guy? Why not just let the baby go and eventually have one with Rudy?

**TL;DR: sorry for the wall of text. Basically, every time there is a major time travel event in Misfits, there is at least one thing that makes very little sense about it.**

true,AntiEssentialism,flare-brum,Harborne,"American living in Birmingham here, but I did it via marriage (which is honestly the easiest way to get a visa over here, in my opinion haha). 

Anyways a more practical response: you are far more employable than I am in terms of degree and experience, but personally I have found that it is very, very difficult to find companies that will sponsor you, because companies don't like to go through the sponsorship unless they specifically NEED a foreigner. 

I have also found that most major employers in the region (the ones likely to sponsor foreigners) go through recruiters and do not directly post job opportunities. 

Therefore, I would recommend contacting every architecture, construction, etc company you can track down and email their HR department with a CV and cover letter explaining your situation (even if their site claims they have no vacancies). Maybe try the [Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents](http://www.rospa.com/vacancies/?nf=107) as a starting point?

You can also try speaking with recruiters--[Anders Elite](http://www.anderselite.com/birmingham-recruitment-agency) specialises in recruiting for the construction/architecture/building services sector. 

Alternatively, have you considered applying for a course over here that will familiarise you with local laws/codes or study something else? You can stay on a student visa (even p/t), learn the skills you need, and then you'll be able to apply for jobs that will keep you here.

1. Doctor 10 established very clearly that the Time Lords coming back was a TERRIBLE idea. It scared him. He considers what the time lords became during the war to be an evil as great as the Daleks. And then comes little Clara and tells 11 to ""Be a doctor,"" As if he forgot. Then he comes up with a nice scheme to make everything better again. I know that the staff changed. I know the producers changed. Never before or since have I seen The Doctor about face so awkwardly on a topic so clear and dear to his hearts. I don't buy it. I don't believe it. I consider it an 'ends justify the means' scriptwriting of getting us from A to B because ""I said so"" without having put in the work to justify it. That is lazy.

2. A TARDIS blowing up is a big deal. Such a huge deal that it destroys the universe. Such a big deal that all the Doctor's enemies unite to stop him at Stonehenge. It is such a big deal we need an entire second new big bang to undo the damage, and it nearly wipes The Doctor out of existence to do it. We don't find out what happened to the TARDIS for two seasons. It's forgotten. Glossed over. Pushed aside to make room for new adventures involving astronauts and lakes. (Don't get me started on THAT.) And then when it's obvious there will be no more time to wrap it up we get the long deserved explanation we were expecting over what can blow up a TARDIS and why. ""The Kovarian chapter went back and did it.""  ... Oh. of course. why didnt you say so? It all makes sense to me now. Hold on... no. That is not acceptable writing.

The Sturridge comment WAS a gamble?

If we are talking since BR has taken over he has bought Coutinho, Sahko , Migs and Sturridge who will be regulars in the first 11. And if we ARE to not just win the league this season but continue to challenge we will need another 4 world class players. So 8 isnt an unfair comment.

Id argue the BR comment was a bit of mind games, add a bit of pressure to your most hated rivals manager, whos job was already a big one?

The SG comment was his own opinion, and being the most successful manager in EPL history, hes more than entitled to have it.

And i doubt a Fergie team would have rolled over as they did in the weekend.

true,notnotcitricsquid,null,null,"&gt; Thirdly, the repayments on a £95,000 may be a little bit more than I can afford comfortably

Then you're probably not going to get a mortgage. Mortgage providers have strict rules (and they're getting even stricter). For example it's unlikely you'll get more than 4-5x your salary, do you earn over £20k? Your car finance is going to reduce the amount you can borrow. Lenders are more and more anal about affordability at the moment.

&gt; I was told this was a good thing because in time those payments will be easier to make as my pay will increase, and then I'll have a nicer house. Does this sound reasonable?

Nope, that's absolutely batshit crazy if you're on a low income. The logic is sound in a vacuum but we're not in a vacuum. Expect the worst to happen and plan accordingly. Home ownership is expensive because of mystery costs that will just turn up out of nowhere, if you're already stretching yourself thin then you set yourself up to be stretched so thin you break. Your boiler breaks: you're fucked. Interest rates rise? Double fucked. Don't think those things won't happen, because they do, it's routine. That's (part of) why rent can often be higher than mortgage payments, because rent includes the costs to landlords of maintaining the property. 

You have also missed the costs of buying a house, you'll be looking at anywhere up to £2000 for the actual purchase (mortgage arrangement, survey, moving fees) on top of the deposit amount, and then you're also going to potentially need to pay for the first month of mortgage payments just after moving in (depending on when in the month your mortgage repayments start, varies lender to lender).

Personally I do not believe you are in a financial position to be considering purchasing a property and doing so will put yourself in a very dangerous financial position. If you don't have an emergency fund (do you?) it's *even worse*. Property ownership is a huge huge huge commitment and it's not as simple as ""oh well if it all doesn't work out I'll just sell up and go back to staying with friends"".

On #1. It was established by 10 very clearly that the Time Lords using their ""final sanction"" was a bad idea. Ending the Time War by killing everyone on both sides, including the billions of innocent children, is the least Doctor-like thing he had done in the entire run of the series (if he ever technically really did it in the first place). The combination of the massive push by the Daleks and horrible thing the time lords were about to do was the reason that the war doctor felt he had to use the moment at that exact time.

It took the three Doctors Together and a push from Clara to get the Doctor to even consider that a different option existed. I personally believe that the intended inference is that orchestrating that situation was the purpose of the moment in the first place. It's the Time Lord's ultimate weapon, wouldn't it make more sense that the way it worked would be to manipulate events in time rather than just making a big explosion or something?

#2. A TARDIS blowing up is not that big of a deal, otherwise the first TARDIS lost in the time war would have ended the universe. It's made clear the whole time that The Doctor knows there is more at play than only his TARDIS exploding. This is why he sees the crack in the universe behind his door. He knows it's still out there somewhere and that even he doesn't know what caused it in the first place. I will admit it is vague how the cracks in the universe interacted with the exploding TARDIS to create the events in the big bang

As for the how the TARDIS was blown up, I don't see that as such a huge plot point. A TARDIS can be blown up fairly easily by the right people (The Daleks were experts in fighting TARDISes.) Seeing as it happened while River Song was in the TARDIS alone, and she is a creation of the same Sect, it's really not a huge stretch that they were able to get to it, if for no other reason than River's presense allowed them to locate it.

Lazy writing would refer more to things like the way continuity and canon are hand waved away when they become inconvenient to the story of the week, or turning the sonic into a solve-it-all magic wand, or a love-conquers-all ending, etc.

The convoluted plot lines are a mixed bag.  On the one hand I do applaud the fact that he did try to take it to a little more of an epic level, but on the other hand, when I see so many people having to post questions online asking for help in understanding what happened, then something has gone wrong.  Doctor Who was never meant to be in a category with shows like Lost or Twin Peaks, serials that were intentionally designed to fuck with your mind by being overly clever and pulling the rug from under you; the average viewer shouldn't have to make an effort to understand the plot.

My biggest dislike of his style is what I feel to be really flat characterization.  He develops characters, particularly the Doctor, in an exaggerated style.  Eleven is written like a fanfic interpretation of the Doctor.  The companions never really resonated with me, probably because they are only developed out around the Doctor.  

Writers need to remember the Eight Deadly Words - ""I don't care what happens to these people.""  That's sort of how I felt with his run.  The complex plot lines would have bothered me less if I felt enough of a connection to the characters to care about how it was all going to shake out.

At the end of the day though, it is all subjective interpretation.  RTD and Moffat had different styles, and Doctor Who is a show that the verbal minority is very passionate about.

true,PeeledApples,cnty-scotland,Still British,"&gt; Does this mean that we have to give 60 days notice pretty much straight away from 25th April and then be OUT by 24th June, or does it mean that we can give 60 days notice at any point during the period between those two dates, theoretically allowing us to leave at the end of July (which is what we need)? 

Kind-of.

You can give the minimum of 60 days notice. The minimum term of your contract is up to the 24th June. 25th of April is 60 days before the 24th of June, so it's the earliest opportunity for you to submit a valid 60-day notice.

While the notice cannot be given before the 25th April, once that date comes, you can offer them a notice of any duration beyond the minimum. It doesn't specify an upper limit. So, if you want, you can submit a notice on the 25th April saying that you wish to end your contract on the 31st July (97 days), or you can wait until whatever date gives you the full 60 days until your intended departure (eg.

Finally, there's the fact that caloric density is a big issue with regards to - for example - fruit.

This pisses me off more than anything else. If this keeps up then within the next decade the majority of the workforce will be paying the high rate. 

I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of London is already suffering from this.

If your girlfriend isn't going to be contributing to the mortgage or living in the property then having her named on the mortgage isn't great, not all lenders will be happy with such an arrangement. Putting her name on the mortgage not only gives her ownership, it gives her liability too. 

I stand by my original assertions if your income is only £25,000, it's not a good idea to try and buy a property the moment you have enough cash to get the bare minimum deposit together, it's a recipe for disaster. I also noticed in another comment you said you don't have an emergency fund, an emergency fund is an absolute necessity in life to avoid financial problems and purchasing a property without an emergency fund is like riding a motorbike with no helmet.

There's a reason most single people in their first job don't buy property and unfortunately I don't see how you can comfortably do so without putting yourself in a difficult position. Another consideration is your marriage, if you're getting married then you're going to have wedding costs and you're not going to be able to afford a wedding if you're just scraping by with a mortgage -- granted it's possible her/your family will pay for it, but it's still a big financial event on the horizon.

In fact voting for Tory does not count either but at least if you do that it feels like you had a say in what you got.

So far so shit as a power goes.  Now let’s say I am lucky enough to live in an area that is not a safe seat what are the differences exactly between the two parties that can win? What difference will either of them being in power actually make to my life? So far my experience has been none at all.

All told I find the awesome power of democracy somewhat shit.  Of course as Churchill said it's the best shit system we have (possibly paraphrasing) so it's not like we have an alternative. 

Really having thought about it the big plus point of a democratic system like ours is not that it empowers the voters, because it really does not, but that it means those who lead us cannot get too comfy in their positions and we will never be stuck with any of them for too long. Of course the replacements will likely be just as awful but again they won’t be able to hog power for too long.  So our democratic system ovoids dictatorship type leaderships but does not result in good leadership or any power to the individual.

I differ from Brand in that I don't think there is a solution. This is the best we can do so let's just get on with it and try not to let it annoy you too much.

Read. That's it, really. Read, read, and read some more. That'll get you through the degree (and the MA, it seems). Don't be afraid to express your own ideas in your writing, but ensure that those ideas are solidly supported by data. In fact, let the sources do the work for you. Don't start a piece of research with too much of an agenda. Research well and let your interpretation of the data shape the argument you make or the questions you ask. It's ok to argue that established historians are wrong about things, but any criticism has to be justified. History is a beautifully flexible subject in that you can incorporate your other interests into your research projects. Moreover, if you're into literature, philosophy, sociology, anthropology - all these approaches and subject areas can be used within the context of historical enquiry. Take an interest in the classes and the reading, always think critically and analytically, always keep asking questions, and enjoy it!

Basically the way I see it is that through the 60's to the 90's sub cultures sprung from underground music movements and the surrounding fashions and attitudes they spawned, the internet however ( especially social networking ) has commercialised, bastardised and homogenised music to such an extent that any underground movement is pigeon holed or commercialised before it even gets a chance to spread. No one wants to be part of a sub culture that's been commercialised from the off, it's not a ""cool"" thing to be seen as part of and we now have whole teams of marketing people who trawl the internet looking  for the next big thing to exploit, leaving a situation where  sub cultures are pretty much over before they even get a chance to take root. 

I'm not saying that this hasn't always happened, it has. It's just a lot more in your face nowadays. 

You could also say that there's such a large range of immediate choice that everyone is basically either doing their own thing or confused about who they're being told to be. 

Of course we still get underground music movements here; Dubstep and Grime being two ( not so ) recent ones. But again they've been bastardised, assimilated and homogenised by the mainstream in record time. 

Dubstep is as interesting one because it was underground here for a while, sucked up by the US and shipped back over here in a form ( which I can only call electronic thrash metal ) that had no resemblance to the original at all. I suppose you could say it evolved in that respect. 

Of course there are subcultures like EDM in the US, but that's just a carbon copy of the 90's dance movement and it is in itself extremely commercial even though people in the US will argue you blind that it's not and it's something they've just discovered. 

To be honest though I could write a book on this subject but obviously don't have the time to do that here. So that's just my short two-penneth worth. 


In short though: I personally think that the internet has injected too much choice into the equation.

This isn't a group of people that are going to simply sit down and do a cost benefit analysis of going to university as it impacts the next 30 years of their life.

Now, when you factor in the fact that plenty of these kids parents aren't around and the fact that, for example, of the ones who are there none of them have ever been to university and many of them don't know the word compound interest let alone what it means then you start to see why long term financial planning to relieve the burden of short term debt is something that would discourage them. The fact is that being from a poor background is not just influenced by the job you do but by your ability to engage in long term financial planning.

They're willing to hinder their own prosperity rather than pay back money which they freely borrowed, which doesn't seem to be beneficial either to the system of higher education or graduates who should be making a far larger contribution to the economy.

Edit: of course, there's little evidence that this is actually happening. My point is that the idea that the student loan is 'free money' is hardly going to encourage people to support the system.

true,gooneruk,cnty-england,London,"Your constituency is actually a good example of how AV will actually benefit both local and domestic politics.

Under AV, you continue to vote locally for an MP to represent your area in the national parliament. They may be a representative of a national party, but could equally be an independent or from a local party.

The difference comes in how the vote-counting works in each constituency at election time: when voting, each voter ranks candidates in order of preference, rather than one all-or-nothing vote for one candidate only.

The votes are tallied, and if somebody gets 50%+ of the votes, then they win, as simple as that.

If none of the candidates get 50% of the vote, then the candidate with the lowest number of votes is eliminated. The ballot papers of the people who voted for that candidate are re-examined, and their 2nd preference votes are added to the tallies of those candidates remaining.

If someone then makes it to 50% of the votes, they win. If not, the next lowest candidate is eliminated, and the 2nd preference votes of their supporters are added to the remaining candidates (as are the 3rd choice votes for anyone who voted for the 1st eliminated and then 2nd eliminated candidates).

The field of candidates is continually trimmed in this manner until someone hits the 50% mark, at which point they are declared the winner for that constituency, and become its MP.

In theory, this should lead to more consensus candidates and policies, because at some point the candidate needs to appeal to 50% of the local populace. Mobilising your base and appealing only to your niche probably won't be enough under this system.

It should also break the hegemony of 2-party politics, as you'll likely find a Tory or Labour supporter would rather put the Lib Dems/Greens/whatever as their 2nd choice instead of the opposing Tory/Labour candidate.

EDIT: Proportional Representation (PR) is the system where everybody votes nationally for a party, and then the parties dictate who is a candidate for them and which regions they should represent. It breaks the local ties which in our system are very important.

Yeah, it's definitely a lot of this too, I mean you're not going to get bands like The Clash nowadays, the industry in its present form wouldn't entertain them so they'd be a non starter. I mean we wouldn't want to upset the shareholders now would we.

 There's was an interesting [Guardian article](http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/sep/11/1) on this subject a few years back. It'd say the industry has become way worse since then. Stand on your soapbox and your career's going nowhere, tow the line however and you'll be fine. 

Also as a lot of people fail to realise about music and the internet, you still need major backing and finance to get anywhere near the mainstream. There's an internet cry of: record labels are history, a relic of the past, a dinosaur, musicians don't need them. 
 
Yeah... right. Try doing it all yourself and watch the doors firmly slam shut in your face because the exceptions to this rule are very few and far between. You won't get a major tour for example without being signed to a major label. You can survive without a record label, I'm not saying it isn't possible,  but only just and if you're doing this *and* trying to convey a political message then more than likely you'll be doing it to 20 people down the local pub because the industry and the promoters just don't want to know. They just want an easy ride without rocking the boat.

Every time somebody decides not to do a degree the country loses money (on average). You don't seem to be getting this. There is no dichotomy with food bank usage. In fact every time a person decides not to go to university the state has less money and thus is less able to deal with poverty.

Is this clear now? The tuition fees as they stand are a net loss to the exchequer because they won't be earning the extra tax money that a degree generates from the people who now won't go. It is an even bigger net loss to society and the market at large.

The BBC, much like the NHS, needs dire reform as it's no longer the institution it once was. This isn't an attack from the right wing, this is a simple fact that they are wasting huge amounts of cash on frivolous things - whilst closing BBC3 and saying 'we're broke'.

Again, much like the NHS -just because it's being criticised, it doesn't mean a US system needs to be implemented.  There is, you know, a middle ground? Nope? Oh well, one day, you'll wake up and find that people are sick of being criminalised for the sake of your 'brilliant british institution' and it will vanish entirely because a small hard core refused to acknowledge it needed to change.

There's nuance to those positions. Don't you think it would be better if we *didn't* have to go to Nuclear? Admittedly the safety aspect is worlds different to 20 years ago but suitable waste disposal is still an unknown. It is one of the things I want more clarity on from the Greens though - if not Nuclear, how do we fill that energy gap *now*? Especially in light of our current disagreement with Russia. (Not that you could spin up a Nuclear reactor fast enough to cope with that of course).

GM is another one I'm 50/50 on. Using it to improve crop resilience and yields is great. Using it to lock in farmers in the developing world, not so much. I don't have any strong feeling that it's likely to be harmful to humans but testing regimes should still be robust and development should *never* be purely to improve the bottom line of companies like Monsanto.

So far, I haven't noticed the Greens being fanatical about that stuff and I find them *less* likely to ignore true scientific evidence than Labour or the Tories who have been systematically denying scientific truths for decades on issues such as drugs and climate change.

I mean the young are lot more interested in politics when there is a very real threat of being sent to die in a war - like the protest music that surrounded Vietnam.

When politics is just going down the polling booth once every five years to tick a box about which colour tie you want the PR man to wear while he fleeces you for the business interests that fund him - well it's a bit harder to get so worked up - that kind of completely powerless feeling doesn't lead to anger, just disillusionment.

I mean for most people it just doesn't matter at all. There is nothing you can do anyway.

Furthermore nowadays it's far easier to listen to all music from any time ever - so although live gigs are still entertaining in terms of recorded material you don't just have to beat your contemporaries you have to beat everyone, ever.

And it isn't like whole genres are waiting to be invented like Beethoven vs. Chuck Berry - instead most 'innovation' seems to be in tiny subgenres like grime (which is basically rap) and Dubstep (which is basically electronic music).

And young people have less disposable income so that's another pressure too - would they rather save up and go and see a world-famous band than lots of rising music?

I dunno - it just seems that the situations are so different it's hard to even compare them. Let alone to claim one is better than the other.

ok a very very extreme example to illustrate ""why"" 

If only 100 people voted in the UK, then the parties only need to tailor their policies or campaign to those 100 people,  if everyone voted, parties will recognise that people will vote and are willing to vote and need to be convinced to win over the mass majority rather than the exluslive few.

a no vote is a statement of ""it doesn't matter"" so the parties and electorate dont give 2 shits about you (why should they) but i vote is a statement ""i will and do vote so if you convince me i will help you get into power""

There was the groovy gang who hogged the stereo and played nothing but indy-pop and dance who wore tie-dyed shirts and baggy cargo pants, the two goths who appeared for registration then spent the rest of the day mooching around the back of the science block smoking, the metal-heads and indy-rockers who plastered the walls with posters of Jimi Hendrix, AC/DC and The Little Angels and were always forming and re-forming bands that played at the local pub. 

We hung around in our own groups, hardly mixing unless alcohol or end-of-term socials were involved.  The groovy ganged looked down on the metalers for being upstart working class with ambition, the metalers thought the groovy gang were a bunch of pretentious idiots who'd sold out to the mainstream.  Our teachers must have thought they were in Lord of the Flies.

true,BuzzKillington45,cyberman,Cyberperson,"But that hell is exactly what Moffat depicted, in the Night of the Doctor, the rest of the universe essentially views Time Lords and Daleks as equally nightmarish. 

In your quote, 10 is describing the horrible things the Time Lords are doing to win/survive the Time War and that they are equally horrific to the actions of the Daleks. He surely doesn't mean that the two are totally equal.  

The situations are night and day. The Time Lords returning to Earth is unleashing those horrors on Earth, while freezing Gallifrey is eliminating the need to use those horrific measures at all.

The ""Think of the Children"" angle is not new either. Every single incarnation has been about being able to be victorious, even in impossible situations without having to resort to using violence. Think 10 when he gave the speech about never firing the Gun. When 9 cried because ""They were all dead"", he wasn't broken up about ending the horrible part. He was devastated at the collateral damage he caused as a result of compromising that rule. That's certainly not a last minute change, it's essentially even the theme of 9's last episode.  

2- If blowing up a TARDIS is so difficult with the proper technology, there would not have been a time war in the first place.

Background:
Born and raised in Bolton and a life-long Wanderer, however currently live in the Midlands and so don't get to see many games for 90minutes. I have to make do with the 6 seconds at 1am that the fucking football league show allows me to see.

As I haven't been in the stands or seen many full matches, I'm maybe not the best person to comment but I haven't changed my stance from when we got rid of Coyle...

At the time, I said that I didn't believe it was all his fault. Sure some things were a mess due to him but the players under performed massively.
He should've replaced Holden with a loan signing in order to give Holden the full recovery time needed as opposed to rushing him back. However Klasnic, Petrov and the defense under performed too often.

Freedman came in and seemed to concentrate on organizing the club. He has cut the over-paid under-performers. Sure he made mistakes (should've kept K.Davies) but I do believe its all for the greater good.

When Coyle went, and Freedman came in, I said I'd take 3 or 4 years of Championship to totally rebuild the team. Use the academy and get a set playing style before looking to get back in to the Prem.

I still feel this way. I'd give Freedman 2 more years. When we've had a fully fit team, he's fielded a good attacking team and we've seen results.

Going forward I feel positive. Next season we'll hopefully have a midfield with Holden, Davies and Vela plus if we can keep Mason and Juke, we should see a huge improvement on this season.

On a final note, we did everything right against Derby. The way they play, we'd have been exposed if we tried to attack. Brighton out-classed us but I think we got the job done against Derby.

ISPs have a fair idea as to the average amount of traffic that a subscriber uses, and provisions accordingly. This isn't a new idea in telecoms, there isn't a phone system in the world that could cope if everyone decide to make a phone call simultaneously. Instead exchange capacity is based on likely maximum load, where 'likely' is a rather nebulous concept.

So, if an ISP was to provide an absolutely cast iron guarantee of a particular speed to subscribers, it would have to install capacity to cope with every user downloading at maximum speed simultaneously.

 This year NUS conference was also joke, no one stood up for any reasonable issues. Yes there was talk of equality and democracy and green energy all nice things. But there was no debate on real issues, tuition, jobs, degrees. The NUS is a sack of people playing politics rather then doing politics. 

This has resulted to many students, not even caring anymore, the liberal democrats failed, but if they wanted to to show they were sorry directly sorry then get policies that directly help us. The thing is we can live better, when I went to denmark i was amazed at how happy students are and how hard they work because they have the prosperity and control there Unis.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; Yes it is MY responsibility, but why shouldn't there be things to help? Why are you so against helping people? 

I'm not in the slightest against helping.  I'm against patronising students by treating them as if they are all 12-years old.

""Helping"", to me, would be offering extra guidance.  One-on-one counselors that they can go to if the stress is getting too much.  Something more substantive than a couple of hours on a trampoline.

&gt; Jesus christ how obtuse do you want to be? No it doesn't HAVE to be puppies, however that's what it happens to be this time. It's not a compulsory exercise.

And next time?  Kittens?  Ice creams?  Balloon animals?  My point is that these are what you offer to children, not adults.

&gt; You are being pretentious in that you think you are somehow ""above"" such frivolities as bouncy castles and puppies.

I'm arguing that _students_ are above them; not me.  I would be pretentious if I were to be asking that students only be served the Chateau noir 9, 1973 in the bars, because that's the only year worth drinking.  Asking that students be treated like grown ups, I would have thought, would be something that students would welcome.

&gt; You are being hyperbolic in writing off these measures entirely without looking at the bigger picture at all.

What?  I'm specifically talking about the ""bigger picture"" -- that the post-university world is not going to supply you with these stress relieving measures; that students would be better served by learning to deal with stresses their own way.  If that means they personally like bouncy castles, then that is absolutely fine.

&gt; You are being vitriolic in your assertion that students should just be left to their own devices entirely and that by them needing or simply using these services they are somehow less capable in your eyes.

That is not ""vitriol"".  Vitriol is abusive language, like,""How about them for big words big boy?"" and ""cunt"".  You are the one who has resorted to aggressive and personal language, not I.  My attack was directed at the University for mispending your money.

Again: I'm not saying the students are less capable, I'm saying they are _more_ capable than the patronising university assumes them to be.  That ""being left to your own devices"" is a mark of trust, and an assumption that you are not the precious little flowers that you are being treated as being.

How would you view the fact that universities generally provide free counselling services to their students and staff, something which would be paid out of tuition fees and other funding? Many people won't use it, but everyone has access to the same method of relieving stress and sorting out problems.

It's easy to say that it's your responsibility to sort yourself out, but people do need help - the same in all positions of life. It's very easy I'm sure for students to get bogged down with work, staying in their room revising and worrying over their work and not putting their needs first, whereas stuff like this can push them out for a day or something like that.

Sure, it doesn't have to be an animal petting enclosure or bouncy castle, but it's something, right?

No one can go through life having no fun and enjoyment, something which is beneficial for a person's well-being and mental health, especially under what students have as a stressful time of their life so far.

true,barejokez,null,null,"you may not appreciate this comment, but please do read it and give it some thought.  i have a 4 week old baby girl, and have had very similar thoughts to you.

ultimately, there is (kind of) a reason why 18 years old is the age we turn adults. it is the age when we are mentally able to make important decisions (like voting) and physically able to best handle the consequences of our choices (like alcohol).  Your (and mine) worry is that they will turn 18 and make a decision that you don't like, whether it is buying a car not a house, or taking a round the world trip, or spunking it all on drugs.  but 2 out of 3 of those decisions are not objectively wrong, they're just different (and some people will argue about the 3rd), and we need to be relaxed enough to realise that just because we wouldn't do it doesn't mean that everyone else must feel the same way.

my sister (aged 25) bought a mazda MX5 while she was living at home.  my dad got pretty cross as he thought she should be saving for a deposit, but i explained to him that she didn't want a house, she wanted a car. she doesn't want to live his life on repeat, and it's her money to do as she pleases.  now i have to have the same argument with myself.  

i have put money into a child ISA, and will also be starting a SIPP in my child's name.  the SIPP is partly a hedge against the ""wrong"" choices aged 18, but mainly i just like the idea of 60 years compound growth on a pension rather than 35.  more importantly, i've come to terms with the fact that i will teach her what i think the important things in life are, but also to make the right choices for herself.

genuinely hilarious it seems you dont even understand that fallacy or why its a fallacy, you also dont understand confidence intervals.

I have not applied that fallacy i have provided you a worked example of your own stupid reasoning, i  just happened to comment that i was a professional statistician and that i can tell you dont know what you are talking about (as i know you are not one) 

you seem to  not know what confidence intervals are and fallen for the classic moron trap in thinking a 95% confidence interval of data is making a statement that you are 95% confident the data is correct which is not what it means at all.

if you actually had any statistical knowledge you would understand how polling the entire country is so expensive and cumbersome it cannot be practically implemented to obtain any meaningful results on something like the war on iraq.

you will notice i have pointed out your logically idiotic position by showing you that if it could then every uk election and poll can already be foretold by simple polling.

true,DontMuchTooThink,null,null,"Thank you. I certainly do appreciate your comment. 

My problem is that I do think that 18 is too young and I would most definitely go for a Junior ISA if the limit was 21. I just remember that when I was 18, I didn't care about the future.

Being responsible with money and getting tens of thousands of pounds in one go with no strings attached are 2 different things in my opinion. And unfortunately, with junior ISA, once the child turns 18, all letters are addressed to them and the parent is effectively cut off.

Another thing is that lets say my child has a drug problem at the age of 18, but working through it and sort their life out. It would be inappropriate to drop £30k on the child at this stage. 

The money is going to be theirs eventually but I would like to control it until I know they will behave responsibly. 

Also, I might be trying to force this down upon my kids, but I want the money to be spent on a deposit and not a flashy car and ideally I wouldn't want them to know that there is any money for them, until they actually start thinking about getting a house at which point I can deliver the good news. 

If they decide that they don't want the house at 25, they can do whatever they want with the money. I'm just worried that at 18 they might think that they don't want a house and spend all the money on travelling for example. Then, few years later, they settle down and start wanting the house but the money won't be there.

Davies portrayed Gallifrey as a civilization whose leadership is united in believing that destroying Earth is an acceptable course of action... except for two people whose motives are not explored. 

This is the Gallifrey that 10, despite his rule against carrying guns... when he hears that these time lords are coming back - picks up a gun with a panicked look on his face. He also makes it very very clear, he stops Gallifrey from coming back because he KNOWS that bringing back Gallifrey will bring these horrors back into existence, not just to Earth, but to the universe. He's talking about what the Time Lords BECAME. And yes, having to resort to the drastic measure is what makes 9 and 10 the pacifists that they were, but it was very much a last minute change that the Doctor thinks to himself 'Hmm... saving Gallifrey isn't such a bad idea after all.'  The problem is that after seeing how he reacted to Gallifrey coming back in 'The end of time' to how he reacts to the chance to save Gallifrey in 'the day of the doctor' has absolutely no build up, no explanation, no addressing. You can theorize about why this might be until the cows come home, but the fact that this isn't addressed in any way on screen is exactly why this is very lazy writing brought upon by a change in head writers who had a vastly different idea of what Gallifrey is and what its place is in the future of the show.

2- The Daleks could deal with TARDISes. They had to, or there wouldn't have been much of a war. I don't believe they blew up TARDISes, though. We see TARDISes get eaten up by House, and we know that a TARDIS could be melted in the lava thing in the Dalek ship. We see the TARDIS dying on Trenzalore and the rest of the universe is fine. Blowing up a TARDIS is something altogether different, both in its cause, and its effects, and we have never seen it before, or since - probably because it made for a good cliffhanger. There is no escaping the fact that an event that can end the universe deserves an explanation. At the very least to the degree of what can be done to make sure it never happens again. If there's nothing to stop a different chapter from going back and blowing the Doctor's TARDIS... then the fact that the Doctor rebooted the universe is a stopgap measure and could happen again at any moment.

Just a few quick notes though...

&gt; The Greens support a full ban on GM research and testing

I can't see any policy that matches that statement. Their policy is a moratorium on import and production of GMOs but all they say about research is ""We will apply the precautionary principle and place strict conditions on research using genetic engineering to ensure that GMOs do not escape, pollinate other plants or cause other damage."" That is not a full ban and, as you say, is purely about ""doing it properly"".

&gt; they propose sending no new money on roads, ever

That's no new spending on large road infrastructure projects, they're not saying they would never spend a penny on road maintenance. Infrastructure investment would go towards mass-transit solutions. They do have a real bee in their bonnet about cars though, reducing the motorway speed limit to 55mph seems silly with the current advancing fuel efficiency of a lot of cars. Right now, it's far cheaper to drive pretty much anywhere in the country so obviously people are going to do that.

I think my objection is that it seems to me that this is the sort of thing that someone ""trendy"" in the university offices thought up; rather than something that students genuinely felt they needed.

I'm happy with the mini-welfare system that is the offer of free counseling services, because I can well believe that they have long-term positive benefits.  They're also no use to the group of students who are just drunk morons.  Bouncy castles, on the other hand, I can't see what long term benefit they get from that.  If the choice is ""fun"" events like this throughout the year, or funding a full time counselor (for example), then I think the money is being misused.

&gt; I can't believe you really think that the university using their initiative to do something enjoyable for their students is such a bad thing to do.

""Bad"" in the sense that they are evil? No, not at all.  It's all done with good intentions.

What worries me is that I would like Universities to be the preparation for work more than just a place to spend another four years while you think about it.  Perhaps that's an old fashioned view (not that I'm old).  In that respect then, my concern is that companies (whatever anyone might wish) are often ruthless, heartless organisations, and if you aren't prepared for them caring about their deadlines more than your stress levels then you are in the very mental-health danger that I'm being vilified here on reddit for not worrying about.  Very few companies are going to say ""hey guys, I know we've got a new product to deliver tomorrow, and we're all running on nerves and coffee, but let's stop for a trip to the ice rink""; and unless students are prepared for that in an environment where there is far more support available, then I think a great many will crumble in the less-forgiving environment.

I'm simply trying to think longer term than ""end of semester exams"", when it comes to well being.

In defence of myself on this thread, I'd like to point out that, assuming my thesis is right, I should selfishly be in favour of universities producing crappier outputs, since that would those who came before at an advantage relative to them.  Obviously I believe my own thesis, so I am trying to be unselfish about wanting better for students than I believe they are getting when they are patronised by their University.",0,1395412686,null,0,1395412925,0,cg89tmj,t3_20zh1n,t1_cg89tmj,t1_cg892sm,null,1433005465,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

2) Can't see you beating Bayern in any way. I think keeping it below a 5 goal difference will be tough. As for the league, Europa League is well within reach, Champions League, not so much.

3) Olympic Stadium will be a huge move for revenue purposes, but we'll need a new manager and potentially new owners to keep the fans happy.

4) When the going was tough in December/January, I was one of the fans saying he should go, but he has proven himself capable of keeping us up. I would like someone with more tactical flexibility.

5) He's a very up and down player, much like an English Adel Taraabt, but I think at QPR under the tutelage of Joey Barton, he might just get his act together a little bit.

6) Best signing and new favourite player would be Adrian. Don't forget, he was MOTM at the Bernabeau against Madrid last season. Worst signing would be Johnson. Massively out of his depth at League 1 level by all accounts, let alone Premier League.

7) Youth team looks good at age level, but the step up to the senior team is quite something else. Can't see anyone making the transition unfortunately.

8) The only thing I want season on season is to improve on our previous campaign. If that's not possible, then an exciting and successful relegation scrap is always good fun to watch.

9) Adrian, Demel, Reid, Tomkins, Armero, Noble, Diame, Downing, Nolan, Jarvis, Carroll.

true,ffhfhffh,null,null,"Basically, provided you can find a savings account with an interest rate higher than the interest rate on the loan, you should save any extra money and avoid paying back the loan as much as possible because you will earn more money in interest from the savings account than you will lose from interest paid on the loan.

The interest rates on the old style student loans aren't like any other loans - they are guaranteed to be either the Bank of England base rate + 1% or RPI, whichever is lower. This means they have been pegged at 1.5% for the past few years. Meanwhile, you could get an ISA with an interest rate of say 2%.

So say you had a spare £1000 - you could save £15 in interest on your student loan by paying it back early, or earn £20 putting that in the ISA. 

Overall in this example you are only £5 better off keeping the money in savings, but there are other perks too. For example, it gives you flexibility in an emergency situation where you need the money. Also, chances are you are going to be taking out a far larger loan later on in life like a mortgage, and having a larger deposit can make you savings on your mortgage repayments that will dwarf any savings you could have had on your student loan.

Things aren't so black and white with the new style student loans since 2012 though. For low and middle earners things are broadly similar, but higher earners will probably want to pay back the student loan more quickly if they can, because they get hit much more under the new system.",0,1395412722,null,0,false,0,cg89u5j,t3_20z9cz,t1_cg89u5j,t1_cg88keh,null,1433005473,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

You do understand how the Tory party works? There is the sane wing, the Thatcherites and the bat shit moralists. The sane wing and the Thatcherites are usually in competition with each other, especially with the rise of UKIP (who appeal to the Thatcherites). Both the primary wings of the party have historically had to appeal to the so called cornerstone group to maintain a firm grip on the party. That is what happened to Thatcher, she lost control of the cornerstone group and a one nation Tory back stabbed her.

This is why the Tories invariably say one thing and do another, particularly on human rights.

So if your debt is increasing by less than inflation, you want to avoid paying it as much as possible.

My reason for doing so was because it seems a little bit hypocritical for you to start picking when it suits you to be a ""legal adult"", but not a ""medical adult"" such that you can always have all the fun, but you are still completely responsible?

Genital mutilation through circumcision is the most common form perform on boys. Although it isn't right to remove it from a child for non-medical purposes as they don't get to have a choice in the matter, circumcised men can definitely go on to have a relatively normal sexual life.

Females who undergo genital mutilation, however, generally have it much worse. Type II mutilation, where the labia and clitoris are removed, can cause women to experience next-to no or no sexual pleasure at all, and it can also be highly damaging to their physical and mental wellbeing. This is clearly worse than male genital mutilation (not to imply that this is ok). Type III FGM is even worse, where all external genitalia are removed completely, leaving a small hole for menstruation and urination. A knife must be used to access the vulva for intercourse and childbirth. I don't know if this takes place in this country, but this is utterly despicable, akin to male castration. I'm sure you can appreciate that this makes eradication a priority.

If the United States were being invaded by a force capable of taking over, the scene on the streets it would be just as you described. There would also be a war room somewhere where the leadership would be discussing every option, and may end up settling on horrific ones. If something were to happen to make the invading force suddenly disappear, the leadership would not use the horrific options, regardless of how warped they had become.

To the war doctor by himself with the moment, there are two options, do nothing and allow one or both sides to do whatever horrific actions, or end it all himself. It wasn't until 10 and 11 were there until he believed a 3rd option was available. 

It's not a matter of it now being a good idea, it's a matter of saving Gallifrey without the Time Lords doing something horrible now being possible.

I think there is a lot of evidence presented that whatever the Bad Wolf is orchestrated the situation, and it's really an elegant plot line with lots of lead up and forethought.

1. Bad Wolf was originally created when Rose looked into the heart of the Tardis.
2. The events that led up to Bad Wolf's creation were caused by Bad Wolf Herself.
3. The Doctor's wife gives us a lot of insight into how the living part of the Tardis feels about the doctor. There are a few quotes in particular that I find particularly telling:
""I wanted to see the universe, so I stole a Time Lord and I ran away.""
""No, but I always took you where you needed to go.""
Also, the line about tenses being hard almost exactly mirrors one of the first lines from the Moment's ""Conscience""
4. The Tardis purposely educates Clara about the time war, including showing how much regret the doctor feels over not being able to save the innocent people on Gallifrey.

It requires different and specific laws to try and combat it, because it is an entirely different problem compared to male circumcision. 

 FGM causes a lot more problems for women than circumcision does for men.


Depending on what they actually do - some just excise the clitoris, some actually remove the labia and sew up the vaginal orifice, and is then re-opened once the woman is married (although sometimes it isn't and it gets ripped open during intercourse, with lots of obvious associated problems, including psychological)

Sometimes they obstruct the urethra which opens out usually very close to the vagina, so the girl goes into urinary retention and kidney failure.

It can cause scarring which makes the various parts of the genitalia fuse together making it impossible to have intercourse or deliver a child safely, but sometimes even blocks menstrual blood and this can get infected and be lethal.

Damage to the nerves which are just blindly cut off can lead to tumours at the end called neuromas - which are usually very painful and basically sending a constant 'pain' signal back to the brain.

There can be urinary incontinence if the practitioner damages pelvic muscles or sphinter - which is easy to do if they are operating on a young child especially.

Similarly to with male circumcision of course is the risk of transmission of HIV, which is more prevalent in the countries where FGM is mostly carried out, but of course not unique to those.


A lot of it comes down to the fact that male circumcision involves removing the foreskin - which by virtue of the fact it is situated at the end of the penis is not intimately involved with the complex anatomy of the genitalia and pelvis, so the complications are more limited to local damage such as bleeding, infection, trauma to the end of the penis.   There is little risk of infertility, incontinence or impotence, chronic pain or infection.  It also does not have the same cultural background to it necessarily - FGM is often about 'control', taking away women's sexual freedom, which isn't really the case for males.

I'm not necessarily advocating selling him, but I think we have to accept that he's flopped this season. By any objective measure his goalscoring record has been very, very poor. We bought him at huge cost as an out-and-out goalscorer who could get us 20+ league goals per season. We paid a huge amount for him because he wasn't some raw 18 year old or an over-the-hill 35 year old. He was a goalscorer at his peak, with the maturity to adapt to a new league. It just hasn't worked. I agree that we haven't created as much as we have in previous seasons and he's had to be patient when goalscoring opportunities arose, but he's nearly always fluffed his lines.

Everton? They're more stable than us but not as good.

The Arsenal model perhaps? They have a massive stadium and a massive international fanbase, and a very good manager who had delivered enough silverware to be unsackable when things got wobbly. 

You so easily write off the board as having no long term plan to get us into the Champions League...when we managed that, and would've had a second season too if it weren't for that shit rule.

Honestly, I see Chelsea dropping 5 points at least (3 against us at Anfield) in the final few games. Granted, they have an awesome squad but CL is definitely gonna distract them a bit.

&gt;City. Aguero might miss United and Arsenal games[1] . How big a blow is that? Will they be dropping points anywhere?

This is one team, I'm not certain about. Even if we beat him at Anfield, they can still win the league by winning every other game. And win, they can. It comes down to them making individual errors during the game as tactically, Pellegrini has been getting things right for City.

&gt;Arsenal. No-one's really talking about them winning it. Why not? Like us they have to play Chelsea and City, if that goes well the rest of their games are pretty winnable. Will they win the FA cup?

People usually dont talk about Arsenal because they screw up usually when they are not supposed to. This season, they've held together quite well, IMO. This is where our superior goal difference is going to come handy. Even if they win the same number of matches as us. We will be above them.

&gt;Tottenham and Everton. Who's going to finish highest of these two. Are Tottenham collapsing or have they just had a run of hard games?

I think its gonna come down to the very last match (much like the title challenge). I have a feeling, Everton are gonna finish higher than Spurs. They have a better team dynamic going for them. Also, I rate Martinez higher than Sherwood.

The Doctor is capable of bringing down the British government with six words. Despite this, the Doctor destroys every single living Time Lord. Two hundred years later he has a chance to bring Gallifrey back, and he decides to send Gallifrey back to the time war to be destroyed once again. How we go from that choice, to the choice of putting Gallifrey away in a pocket universe needed a bit more build up than ""What I did was wrong. Just wrong."" How does the Doctor justify bringing back a society whose leadership was intent on destroying the entire universe? He doesn't. They just show us a montage of kids running around.

The altering of the fate of Gallifrey was rushed, and the Doctor himself does not get a big enough personality change to justify it nor any new information is learned by him that should have made him change his mind. The only factor that seems to be in play is his overwhelming guilt.

That, to me, is lazy writing.

As for the Moment/TARDIS/Bad Wolf connection. You should keep in mind a few things. 

1. The Moment took the bad wolf's form to appeal to the Doctor. The Bad Wolf herself hasn't been seen since the end of season 1, and was really just a clever way for the writers to give Billie Piper a cameo without addressing the meta-crisis Doctor.
2. The TARDIS was purposefuly kept away from the moment to not ""let her see it.""

The idea that all of this was planned ahead of time is obviously silly. If this had been planned ahead, we would have been introduced to The Moment earlier, and the Bad Wolf would have been given greater screen time than just literally four minutes at the end of an episode ""the parting of the ways.""

If there was anything else at play; the TARDIS or the original Bad Wolf - none of it was portrayed. The idea is just a good fan theory. Fan theories come in to fill in what the writers didn't explain. That's why the retconn of the fall of Gallifrey was badly conceived.

City, while having huge amounts of money, invested in Mancini. How many people were constantly calling for his head, he wins a title and has 3 consecutive top 3 finishes. They also have players in place like Kompany who provide stability. 

While Chelsea have had a lot of managers in a short period of time, do you think they didn't support and invest in Mourinho? They gave him full control.

While it is risky to give a manager more control, if the right manager is chosen and given backing, you have a better chance for success. Granted there are examples of managers who have been backed and havent had success, AVB, Redknapp, etc. have all mentioned problems with Levy and co. 

Levy wants to be in control, and his end game is not to win titles. Titles would just be a by-product (albeit a great one) of Levy increasing the financial value of Tottenham.

Alistair Carmichael is saying that rUK is under no legal obligation to negotiate in the time between the referendum and Independence and Scotland would be barred from doing so as, presumably, foreign relations are not devolved and the EU wouldn't negotiate except until Scotland was an independent nation*. While that may or may not be true, though certainly it would be contrary to the spirit of the Edinburgh agreement, it's difficult to see the British Government not negotiating on the behalf of Scotland. 

This is especially the case as there are a lot of complications that would arise from Scotland being thrown out of the EU for rUK, including, amongst others, the fisheries ending up outside EU jurisdiction, the rUK's second largest trading partner being ejected from the common market and customs union, and, as he points out, it could lead to the hundreds of thousands of non-Scottish-born UK citizens resident in Scotland being asked to leave due to losing their right to reside (that would include losing access to healthcare services, educatational services, and so on). 

No one is asking for pre-negotiation here, this is Carmichael saying there will be no negotiation on behalf of Scotland and using legal structures to prevent Scotland from negotiating on its own behalf. It's absurd. The most that would be required would be for Westminster to say 'The Scottish Parliament is now empowered to negotiate to secure continued access to the EU'. It would be nice to think we could expect a friendly help from rUK, even driven through the sheer self-interest of having Scotland within the EU, but surely no one could think it's justifiable to not to do that and also prevent any form of negotiation from pre-iScotland.

&gt;The autobiography, which was published in July 2006, 'referred to a private meeting with Mr Moyes where Mr Rooney stated his intention to leave Everton and the city of Liverpool by reason of intense press coverage of his personal life and its effects on Mr Rooney and his fiancee, Coleen McLoughlin.'
The solicitor added: 'Mr Moyes was accused in the book of immediately leaking the contents of that private and confidential conversation to the Liverpool Echo, with the result that an account of the meeting appeared in the next day's issue.'
He told the judge: 'Mr Moyes was not the source, direct or indirect, of anything in the article. There was no breach of confidence or betrayal of trust by Mr Moyes...
'Happily, Mr Rooney, Mr Davies and HarperCollins Publishing Limited appear here today by their solicitor to acknowledge that they were mistaken and publicly withdraw the allegation and apologise.
'The defendants have also agreed to pay Mr Moyes a substantial sum in damages and his legal costs.'

City have players like Kompany because they can afford obscene wages. If we could match their wage bill we would never have had to get rid of Carrick, Berbatov, Modric, Bale, and would have ended up with a stupendous team. But no, our limit is £60k/wk because we can't afford any more. Also, City sacked Mancini for finishing second the year after winning the title. Investing in the manager much?

Yeah they gave Mourinho control - they gave him unlimited funds. We can't match that. We've got books to balance. Again you underestimate the importance of money in football.

""Titles would just be a by-product (albeit a great one) of Levy increasing the financial value of Tottenham"". Look at what you wrote there. Can't you see how non-sensical your logic is?

Have you had a quick look around the area(s) you would like to live? Is 100k the minimum you think you'd get a place for?
I know I found it a bit hard to get a mortgage, and I bought mine for around £81k, however I was required to put a 15% deposit down to secure that mortgage. Things were a bit different back then (there weren't these 5% deposit schemes), but maybe not that much different.

If your friend is ok with you staying with them for a bit longer, I'd try to do that, build up a better deposit. Its what I did for about a year before getting my place (went from renting alone to living with a friend to save a bit more money). Also, I didn't have a need to drive, so saved a lot of money there.

As for keeping the money somewhere in the meantime. If you are going to keep the money for over a year, then put as much as you can into a cash ISA. Might not seem like a lot, but even at 2% thats an extra £100 on £5000 - its better than nothing.
If you are definitely going to buy somewhere within a year, then it doesn't matter where you keep that money.

Other things you'll need to consider:

* Legal fees - Mine were around £800, which I'm told is very reasonable, however my mortgage deal was pretty straightforward, I don't think they had to do anything out of the ordinary

* Health Insurance - my mortgage required this - I pay roughly £30/month

* Income Assurance - my mortgage required this - I pay roughly £30/month

* Factoring fees - the flat I bought required this to be paid monthly. The factor takes care of the general upkeep of the building, covers buildings insurance, communal areas of the building, etc. Mine is relatively cheap at about £35/month, but I hear this can be much more expensive elsewhere

* Contents insurance - not required for the mortgage, but you're an idiot if you don't get some

* Furniture - depending on where you buy, you might need to buy white goods like a cooker, fridge, freezer, washing machine, etc. And also other furnish items, sofa, table, bed, etc. These costs can add up, so make sure you have some money after the deposit to spend on these.

* emergency fund - you really need this. Incase things happen in the property that you need to fix - boiler breakdown, plumbing problems, etc.

Overall, I'd recommend you wait a while longer to build up a better deposit.",0,1395422672,null,0,false,0,cg8edu3,t3_20wl8n,t1_cg8edu3,t3_20wl8n,null,1433007680,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

Q2: Probably around 5th or 6th. They have no chance against Bayern.

Q3: I am, it will help us financially in the long run and hopefully lead to bigger and better things. I'm still sad that we're leaving the Boleyn though.

Q4: Right now, yes. He's the right man for the job although if we move on in a couple years or whenever I won't be upset.

Q5: I think he has unbelievable potential and I hope we hold onto him. I think he had a falling out with Big Sam and that's why we loaned him out, hopefully that relationship can be mended as I'm a big fan of Ravel.

Q6: Even though he hasn't played much due to injury I think bringing in Andy permanently will end up being the best signing this year; I've also been a fan of Stewart Downing for years and I'm very happy that he's a part of the team, even if he hasn't always been completely effective. I almost forgot about Adrian as well, he's incredible and I still can't believe we got him for free. As far worst goes, I'd say Razvan Rat and Roger Johnson were almost completely pointless signings.

Q7: Plenty, too many to name really. Potts, Chambers, Spence, Moncur, Lletget and Gordon are at the top of the list for me.

Q8: I think if we get back on form and avoid injuries we can comfortably finish at least midtable.

Q9: Adrian, Demel, Tomkins, Reid, McCartney, Noble, Taylor, Jarvis, Downing, Nolan, Carroll. Subs: Jääskeläinen, Collins, Armero, Diame, Nocerino, J. Cole, C. Cole.

true,frankchester,null,null,"As others have said, universities don't really work like that here. Firstly you go to university to study a specific course (say.. English Literature, or Computer Science etc). You don't pick a good uni and then decide what to study later. You apply for a course.

Generally the way a UK student would decide which uni to go to would be to first decide which courses they like they sound of, which subjects they are interested in and then find their favourite university that offers that course or specialises in that subject. So just saying you want to go to uni ""in London"" is a bit of a reach. 

Secondly in regards to transfers, this is another issue. I understand that the American system you take ""classes"" which give you ""credits"" and you must achieve a certain number of credits to pass? The vast majority of UK universities do not work like that. You choose to study a course (I study Multimedia Tech). You have preset modules which you must take (core). You have some ""slots"" which allow you to take a semi-random module from another faculty (wild). But even then that isn't true of every course. For example I have never been able to take a wild module in my entire time here. In first year we all had to do the same 5 modules. In second year we took the same 6 modules. In final year we took the same three modules and were allowed to pick the other two from a set of four, all offered by our school.

You might possibly be able to find a university that runs an American system and will allow you to use the credits you have already earned. Or perhaps you will be able to leave university with a form of certification and another uni will allow you to use that as your entry certificate. But I don't think it's that likely.

In terms of scholarships most universities don't offer them, certainly not to a foreigner. You might find some that are specifically designed for international students but considering that international students are seen by most uni admissions departments as cash cows you're probably going to find they will assume you already have money. (After all why would they help a non-national come over to the UK to study, help them pay for it, just for the education to be taken back over to the US.)

I'd recommend looking up degree courses specifically related to your subject interest on UCAS and then seeing if any of those uni's offer second year transfers from international students.",0,1395424203,null,0,false,0,cg8f4r3,t3_20yghk,t1_cg8f4r3,t3_20yghk,null,1433008033,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5

I am not saying that people should be miserable fuckers.  I am not saying that people should be stressed.  I am not saying that companies grinding their employees into the ground is a good thing.

I _am_ saying that there are very few employers who will care, rightly or wrongly, that their staff are stressed.  The University is failing in its duty to prepare students if the students are left without the ability to recognise and handle stress on their own.  Unless you work for some trendy silicon valley startup, then it's highly unlikely your company will ever organise any of the things that the University under discussion here is organising.  The argument that ""well we don't want the students getting stressed"" is to entirely ignore the fact that they aren't going to get that from the rest of the world.

You presumably understand the concept of ""spoiling"" a child?  That giving them everything they want could be, in the long-term, worse for them than the alternatives?  I'm not saying this is ""spoiling"" the students, I'm saying that good intentions aside, this is not necessarily the long-term best thing to do for the students.

You obviously don't agree.  That's fine.  But I'm tired of being painted as Scrooge McEducator, when I've repeatedly said that I am on the side of the students, and base my opinion not on meanness but on having respect for them and a wish for the best for them long term.

So creating a creative space, for creative people, to create things, seems pretty normal to me. No doubt you'd be happier if they were all in grey cubicles, but go to any private sector creative media office and you'll see the same. Google don't spend so much on ""arty farty"" stuff like break out rooms and office design for a laugh. They spend it because it improves productivity.

true,youranass,null,null,"Yes to the cash ISA, fill this up before the end of the month if possible. Then in April open another. 

Set aside some of that as an emergency fund too if you don't already have one.

You could then either: 

1. Invest all of the remainder.
2. Invest some, save some.
3. Save all as cash. 

Number three isn't a great option at the moment, low rates and all. So options 1 and 2 are your best bet. 

If you are going to save some of the money as cash, you'll probably want to look into some of the current accounts available. 

Lloyds have announced one that pays 5% up to 2k, (you can have two of these) no charge, but must pay in 500pcm. 

Nationwide, again 5% current account, up to 2.5k, paying in 1k per month, with no charge.

These two could tie up 6.5k at 5%, you'll just have to bounce the money around a bit for those payments.

There are some others, I think there is a scottish bank that offers 4% on a current account, but I dont remember the name. 

Also look into a capital one regular saver. This pays 6%, and you can pay in £300 per month. So drip feed this from a lower rate savings account elsewhere.

Others on here will tell you the Santander 123 current account is great (personally I dont think it is amazing so would use this last)

It pays 3% on balances between 3k and 20k, and lower rates for amounts below that. I think the conditions are - 2 direct debits, and at least 500 in pcm. There is a charge of £2 per month, but they do give some cashback too. 

In terms of investment, I'm not one to give you advice, but tracker funds, and some of the bigger, lower charging investment trusts are youre best bet (watch out for fees if you invest through an s&amp;s ISA) 

Try and seek some advice, maybe a family member who is good with investments, for more specific stuff - although someone might post funds they prefer. 

Another thing - try to keep this up for the next couple of years, let the rates rise before you consider locking away money for 3 or 5 years.
