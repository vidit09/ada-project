true,happycrabeatsthefish,null,null,"First of all, thank you for taking the time to respond to my counter arguments. I did my best with yours: 

&gt; **Point 1:** ""Criminals have them in the UK as well yet we don't see people being shot by them on a regular basis.""

There's a reason for that. The UK is nothing like the United States when it comes to the criminal element. Don't believe me? Think about this: What ban has actually worked in the U.S? No bans work the the U.S., because the people can make anything they want to meet demand. Isn't that the American way? ""If you can dream it you can build it""? And cartels in Mexico are more than willing to fill any demand American criminals can't produce, guns or drugs. 

&gt; **Point 2:** The civilians who have them are as you even admit yourself, not trained anywhere near the level that the military are.

I think you misunderstood by what I meant. 1) Training on something different is not training less and 2) lots of the training military and police get have nothing to do with guns (Radio, vehicles, logistics related equipment, signing while running, reporting, etc.).  

The above average performing CHL holder will always outperform the above average performing government worker (military &amp; police). I guarantee this. Every competitive shooter I've talked to beat the police at the state level. In other words, it's not that CHL guys get less training, it's that they can get more of a different type of training. Let me put it another way. Imagine the CHL holder is a doctor, lawyer, engineer, or an accountant, who has the money and free time to customize his gun and pay for the top equiptment and training instructors to be ready in a self defense senario. Then they go out to competition every Thursday to compete with each other. These above average CHL permit holders you're say are not trained enough can out train any government worker. And they didn't have to waste any time on learning how to jump out of helicopters or filing try meal inventory reports. 

&gt; **Point 3:** they are not given the proper training on how to react and are more likely to ""shoot first, ask later"".

Well, first of all, nobody is training a CHL holder to ""shoot first, ask later"". They cover law and saftey. Also, that a there's ""a lawyer attached to every bullet"".  In other words, you come out knowing that using your gun in self defense will cost you a lot in court fees. You'll probably also be arrested just because the cops have no idea who the actual bad guy is. We see guns like fire extinguishers in the way that, ""you never want to use it, but if you have to it's there"". 

When you say, ""they are not given the proper training"", you're probably thinking that the proper training would look much like your military training, when it's not. Forget that. I keep saying this: Military training is not what a CHL holder needs. It helps, sure. But when you conceal carry, your primary objective is to never need to use your gun ever; avoid conflict at all costs. 

Here's something to think about. In a *civilian situation*, drawing your weapon will end the situation 90% of the time. If not, almost all gun fights are ended in 3 shots at less than 15 feet. Now, you're thinking, based on your training, where's the suppressing fire to let your squad reposition? There is none of that. And where do you use a red dot illuminated scope? You don't need it at five to fifteen feet. Your idea of proper training, is appropriate for war. This is not war I'm talking about. If you required that CHL holders got that kind of training, they wouldn't be training for a self defense senario at a gas station a 2am.",0,1399163993,null,0,false,0,ch8weip,t3_23o79r,t1_ch8weip,t1_ch8v9xm,null,1433639444,1,false,Britain,t5_2qjyt,1

&gt;PSNI investigation and Boston College tapes

&gt;In August 2006, the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), Sir Hugh Orde, said he was not hopeful that anyone would be brought to account over the murder, saying that ""[in] any case of that age, it is highly unlikely that a successful prosecution could be mounted.""

&gt;PSNI investigation and Boston College tapes

&gt;In August 2006, the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), Sir Hugh Orde, said he was not hopeful that anyone would be brought to account over the murder, saying that ""[in] any case of that age, it is highly unlikely that a successful prosecution could be mounted.""

&gt;Boston College had launched an oral history project on the Troubles in 2001. It recorded interviews with republicans and loyalists about their involvement in the conflict, on the understanding that the tapes would not be released until after their deaths. Two of the republican interviewees, Brendan Hughes and Dolours Price, said they were involved in McConville's kidnapping. Both were opposed to the Good Friday Agreement and Sinn Féin's support of it but they were not dissident republicans in the sense that they did not advocate a return to political violence. In particular, they saw Gerry Adams as a traitor for negotiating the Agreement and persuading the IRA to end its campaign. In 2010, after Hughes's death, some of his statements were published in the book Voices from the Grave. He claimed that McConville had admitted being an informer, and that Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams was involved in her disappearance. In February 2010, according to an article published in the Sunday Life, Price claimed that Adams had ordered her to take McConville to be killed. The article made it seem like the journalist had had access to the interviews given to the Boston College, which has been strenuously denied by Ed Moloney. Price said she gave the interviews as revenge against Adams. She died in 2013. Adams has denied any role in the death of McConville.

&gt;In 2011, the PSNI began a legal bid to gain access to the tapes. Acting on a request from the PSNI, the United States Justice Department has tried to legally force Boston College to hand them over. This legal dispute sparked a debate about journalistic freedom, as Boston College promised those interviewed that the tapes would not be released until after their deaths. Other interviewees said they feared retribution if the tapes were released. Following a lengthy court battle, the PSNI was given transcripts of interviews by Hughes and Price.

So republicans who claim to be involved (and I would hope to presume that Boston College did due dilligence in working out/verifying their stories) told their stories to Boston College who then in turn either blabbed to journalists or the Boston College information leaked to the press, the PSNI then got a court order helped by the US Justice Department to get them access to that information and now Gerry Adams is arrested. Sounds fine and dandy to me.

Edit: Adding some more pertinent information.

From the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-27238797)

&gt;The 'Belfast Project' was launched in 2001 and was designed to become an oral history of the Troubles.

&gt;Former loyalist and republican paramilitaries gave a series of candid interviews that chronicled their involvement in the Troubles.

&gt;The testimonies of David Ervine of the Progressive Unionist Party, and the former IRA commander Brendan Hughes, who have both since died, formed the backbone of a book by Ed Moloney, and a television documentary.

&gt;In those, Hughes made some frank admissions.

&gt;Hughes also spoke of his once close friend, the Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams.

&gt;Hughes named him as overall commander of the IRA's Belfast brigade.

&gt;He also claimed that Mr Adams had controlled his own squad within the IRA, known by the organisation as ""the unknowns"".

&gt;This, according to Hughes, was the group responsible for the 'Disappeared', those who were kidnapped, murdered and secretly buried by the IRA.

&gt;However, another former IRA member later gave an interview to a newspaper journalist, in which she admitted that she had also taken part in the 'Belfast Project'.

&gt;Dolours Price, who died in 2013, had been one of the IRA gang that bombed the Old Bailey in 1973.

&gt;In that interview, she allegedly claimed to have been the person who drove Mrs McConville to the place where she was murdered by the IRA in 1972.

&gt;In 2011, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) began a legal bid to gain access to the interviews held by the college.

&gt;Following a lengthy court battle, the PSNI was given transcripts of interviews by Brendan Hughes and Dolours Price.

&gt;Mr Moloney has said that Ms Price did not make claims about the Disappeared in the Boston College interviews.

&gt;However, it has since emerged that another interview was conducted with Dolours Price after the Belfast Project was completed and is now in the hands of the PSNI.

So it seems they pretty much outed Gerry Adams.",0,1399165442,null,0,1399166274,0,ch8wwr7,t3_24npjj,t1_ch8wwr7,t3_24npjj,null,1433639746,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

I think it's stupid for kids to specialize at such an early age.  Single exam might be a good idea given that it was possible to only need to remember a tiny amount of the course at a time.

Agreed on coursework though, it's important for people to learn to work independently for extended periods of time, however there was so much cheating on the science coursework that it was actively harmful having those in place (not just a case of everyone gets full marks, so no harm no foul, it was far worse than that).   

Disagree on tiered exams, the threat of getting put on foundation maths felt like a potential death sentence back when I did my GCSEs.  I don't think it's right to put an upper bound on their potential success.

Retakes, I don't know, in two minds about this because I certainly relied on them, but that doesn't mean I should give into the inherent bias.  

Completely arbitrary to change the labels of the grades, so this has no impact.

Free schools are probably a good thing, gives them more flexibility.  If the school is hiring unqualified teachers don't go to that school.

With regards to finishing at 6, it's a bit tricky, as teachers are paid little but need jack shit in terms of qualifications to get the job anyway.  Working until 6 isn't the worst thing imaginable, but at that pay it is.

The information which the PSNI received from Boston College in those tapes is nothing other than hearsay and would never be accepted in court and the police knew this, they more or less knew the content of the tapes before they were released anyway and listening to them, there's nothing knew there. Unless there's some new information that's been released which the public has not been made aware of, then I really don't understand why he's been arrested at this point in time. Besides, there are hundreds of unsolved murders from either side of the divide in Northern Ireland. First Minster, Peter [""Kalashnikov""](http://hughgreen.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/peter-robinson.jpg) Robinson, was involved with loyalist paramilitaries for a while, I wonder how many deaths he ordered. There was death and tears on both side, it was a war. 

Adams' arrest is very convenient. Sinn Féin are now the second most popular party in the Republic (for the first time in nearly 80 years), there's a shift happening in Irish politics in the south, and the upcoming regional and European in the Republic and Northern Ireland will definitely encapsulate this. These elections set the stage for the subsequent General Election in 2016 in the Republic, because if Sinn Féin manages to take over the County Councils they can ""advertise"" their achievements there to help their GE campaign. Gerry Adams, believe it or not, is a serious contender for Taoiseach in 2016. 

Naturally, parties north and south of the border are worried by this, and especially the unionist parties in Northern Ireland, because SF could use their new found influence and power in the south to financially support and spearhead their ultimate campaign to bring about a United Ireland. 

Adams' arrest is also potentially destabilising. Martin McGuinness has said that Sinn Féin might now remove their support for policing in Northern Ireland over this. Sometimes it's better that some stones remain unturned, because it could lead to more tragedy later on.

true,Denswend,null,null,"&gt;How does that work?

It's quite simple enough - I do not believe there are words that can be used as a sacrificial lamb for an entire mentality of bad things. And you have no right to make them. 

Let me clarify, racism is a form of tyranny. Tyranny requires action. No tyranny happened because of words, only actions. Thus, freedom of speech is inherently not tied with the notion of racism. Furthermore, you're extending the range of what is defined as racism to make even saying certain words guilty of jail time. For fucks sake, **one man recited an old nursery rhyme, mumbled the evil and oppressive word, and he's guilty of ""contravention of that spirit of our basic norms on human rights""?** The very notion of someone thinking that way scares me. 

&gt;No, I'm using the experience of an attempted arson in 1994. A beating in 1991. Racist daubings on my car in 1996.. and..well that's the the ones I bothered reporting

&gt; Just because you ancestors were targeted with the oppression because of their skin color, and/or just because you were targeted with oppression because of your skin color, you have no right to censor other's right to say what he wants because you feel that it might end with you on a stake.

&gt;more emotional fuel

This is a tactic I find dishonest and disgusting. Guilt tripping at best. It's giving you a certain air of verbosity, true. But that only serves to cloud your true disgusting intentions.

&gt;Meanwhile - you say it's just words. go up to the person you most love in the morning. Abuse them with all the words that you now they hate. Remind them of all their inadequacies and failures, in detail. Tell them they are worthless and you're going to beat them round the head. Do that for hours and hours, loud as you can.

This is idiotism at its best. Normally I wouldn't dignify this with a response since I would consider this first class trolling but I somehow feel that you're genuine. 

First off, Clarkson called no one a nigger. And he said ""nigger"". Correction, he mumbled it. You are once again doing the very same thing I accused you - *But what you're doing here is charging a single word, an offensive word mind you, that is supposed to be exaggerated insult not true to the real nature of affairs (this is how insults work) with every single bad thing done to your race. Words are full of context, yes, but you do not get to simply charge the context*

Then you use that to the extreme - somehow, this word ""nigger"" is the very thing that it's hated the most - it's all the inadequacies and failures, in detail, the feeling of worthlesness and despair, why, the word nigger is the love child of Satan and Hitler, raised by Stalin. **Riddle me this, if ""nigger"" is truly what you make it out to be, why is it used by blacks so often?** 

But let's humor that notion, just because. Let's say ""nigger"" = every bad thing ever.

Now, if I went by your definition of these horrible and evil things, and called my loved one a nigger, would she break down in tears? Would she take a razor and commit suicide because I was mean? Would she go find a nearest plantation and start picking cotton because the word nigger is so powerful and evil?

No. She would laugh at me. She would call me names in return. That's what normal, emotionally stable people do. They don't call for witch hunts.


&gt;Think on that.

Let me give you my thought, before my thoughts become Hitler. 
You're using emotionally evocative cheap rhetoric logically incompatible with the real world in order to criminalize words. You do this like you have the higher moral ground, because being a black man in a society build by whites, maintained by whites, defended by whites and made magnificent by whites and experiencing bad things in this same society (because while bad things can happen to whites, when they happen to *me, a black person, whose people used to be slaves and pick cotton and stuff* , it's the single most evil thing that can happen in the world - especially if it's name calling) make your moral ground even higher and your words even more just. Then you appeal to people's sense of justice, you turn the victim complex to eleven, you try to garner sympathy in order criminalize of ~~saying~~ mumbling a word from an old nursery rhyme and you do this with a face of the poor and the oppressed minority, and whoever disagrees with you is Hitler himself, the racist supreme who is one step from mass murdering all blacks in the world. Empowered by this victim complex, you change the meaning of the words themselves - suddenly, this word is now ""everything that you hate, the feeling of blabla"" and merely the utterance, no, thought of it can make you abused and oppressed.  After all, some bad people wrote nasty stuff on your car. 

You are fundamentally a cheap demagouge who plays on pity of others, who plays on emotions of others, who wants to criminalize every possible thing that can hurt his precious feelings, who wants power to deprive others from their freedom on the appeals of ""social justice"" and ""words = oppression"", who doesn't want actual equality but rather dominance based on some vague feeling that somewhere, somewhen, saying bad things to a member of one race is equal to every bad things experienced by that race.

You're an insult to every person who fought for his/hers rights and for the rights of his/her group against all possible odds and against a hostile society who had no qualms about a lynching or stoning, to every person who bled and died for those same rights , whether they were black, yellow, women, Christian or Muslim. You are trivializing their struggles by extending your definitions of racism to every bad thing that is said to you. This I find morally disgusting to the utmost degree.

Sounds fine and dandy to me.

The ""evidence"" from the Boston College tapes cannot be used in court, it's mere hearsay from Brendan Hughes and Dolours Price. You couldn't even use the tapes to charge Adams. It should also be noted, as mentioned in the piece you quoted, that Hughes and Price despised Adams for his support of the Good Friday Agreement.

The BBC have decided that, to clarify that they have no truck with racial discrimination, they don't want it on their media.  If they let this fly then it could be seen as a wink to white supremacists - *we know the real deal, right, boys?*

I'm assuming that white supremacists are also sexist, because why not.

So they've issued a warning to make it clear that it *wasn't* subtext, and Clarkson has apologized to make it clear that *he* wasn't making some underhand declaration of allegiance to Stormfront.

Anyhow..its late.. so I'm going to put a few points up for you:

a) Tyranny through inaction or lack of action is perfectly possible. It's called the banality of evil. I'm sure there's enough literature out there on that new fangalled googlemajig think that will help you out. It's also possible to oppress people verbally, to abuse them , bully them and destroy their lives without taking physical action ( here's your starter literature for ten (http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6L0HYxz1CdUC&amp;dq=verbal+abuse+work+place&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s).  
b) Your use of a slippery slope fallacy is a fallacy. I didn't say x will lead to Y. I asked you at what point was it okay, in your eyes, to complain about someone abusing me. Martin Niemoller asks the same question in this poem:

&gt;First they came for the Communists
And I did not speak out

c) if words weren't powerful in causing or influencing action why did the US presidential elections surpass all spending records on delivering words and content in favour of( and sometimes against) candidates. if words didn't set the conditions and cognitive responses for human behaviour then why bother? 


d) the 1948 Universal Declaration on Human Rights was written by people who actually fought a war and saw the consequences of a world where we don't treat humans as equals. If were' going to go the full Godwin, then ask yourself this, why did they consider writing that charter after they'd witnessed that war. Here is the UN declaration on human rights

I'm sure a teacher would be able to explain the more intricate changes which have led them to vote for no confidence in Gove and lead to strikes.

2. NHS has changed, just because you can't see it does not mean it has not changed. £15billion of private contracts much of this to Tory donors. They are 13% funded by private health corporations. Yes Labour did stupid things too.

3. Yay!

4. Implementation for many things in this government has been a joke.

5. Why is a welfare cap a good idea? It caps total welfare if i'm not wrong, therefore the poorest in society could be hit.  Corporate welfare means tax breaks they have introduced for fracking, employment benefits for people in full time work because companies won't pay a living wage, tax loop-holes and London as a tax haven for multinationals, plus never pursuing multinationals for the taxes they owe us, the tax money private landlords get because rents are un- affordable, banks given the right to create money - a tax on all our money of around 3%....there are more examples that's just off the top of my head. Why should we cap money for the poor and not the rich?

6. They have not fixed the problem and have added to it. The private incentive to keep more and more people in jail for profit can't be good.

7. Just because things don't effect me, im not so selfish to think that means they are ok. The Royal Mail has cut 1300 jobs and increased prices since privatization. The tax payer also lost at least £750million in the botched privatization. Another problem was allegations of corruption you can see the other thread http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/24luhf/we_didnt_hear_about_the_royal_mail_sell_off/


8. ...


9.  Fracking in the 80's and the new hydrolic fracking are different. It is much more risky. We should not frack because it will destroy the countryside, use a hell of a lot of water which will become contaminated, and there is no reason to think that the water will not leak maybe not in 5 or 10 years but no one can guarantee what will happen 20 - 100 years. Also methane which is leaked from the wells and obviously the carbon dioxide is a problem. Fracking may also mean less investment in re-newables.

10.  Austerity does not help in times of down-turn, that is why Osbourne has borrowed more in 3 years than labour did in 13. But then he decided to cut services for the poor - it is clearly an ideological tool to get people behind cutting services to the poor while keeping the rich rich.

Privatization is a problem when the incentives become scewed, and private companies have massively more power lobbying politicians than the public. Also in many of these industries there is just not the competition to provide the services and we relay on the same companies that have been terrible in the past G4S, ATOS...I suppose your also happy that aour nuclear deterrent is 66% owned by american corporations. There are many arguments why natural monopolies should not be privatized and many arguments why an NHS is in fact cheaper than private business (economies of scale, and the fact that competition requires advertising, lobbying, profits and excess capacity. Excess capacity is just too expensive in health care.)

true,hiakuryu,cnty-england,London,"&gt;The ""evidence"" from the Boston College tapes cannot be used in court, it's mere hearsay from Brendan Hughes and Dolours Price.

If journalists record people admitting to crimes and implicating others then it's completely accepted that they can be arrested, the same goes for academia. The relevant statements are that confidentiality is “guaranteed to the extent American law allows”

From http://definitions.uslegal.com/a/admissibility-of-oral-and-written-confessions/

&gt;An admissible confession may be oral or written, or partly oral and partly written. The fact that a statement is not reduced to writing does not render it inadmissible. An oral confession of a defendant is admissible at trial even though the defendant made a different, written confession, since a written confession does not cancel out a prior oral confession. A written confession need not constitute a literal transcription of what the defendant said, the substance of what s/he said is sufficient.

Also the Treaty between the US and UK on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. Makes these tapes applicable and that is why the subpoenas were issued for their legal acquisition. So err, what?

http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f227000/227062.htm

Also under English law

&gt;Section 116 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 provides that where a witness is unavailable, hearsay is admissible where a) the relevant person is dead; b) the relevant person is unfit to be a witness because of his bodily or mental condition; c) the relevant person is outside the UK and it is not reasonably practicable to secure his attendance; d) the relevant person cannot be found; e) through fear, the relevant person does not give oral evidence in the proceedings and the court gives leave for the statement to be given in evidence.

An example of hearsay is, to prove Tom was in town, the barrister asks a witness, ""What did Susan tell you about Tom being in town?"" Since the witness's answer will rely on an out-of-court statement Susan made, and Susan is not available for cross-examination, and it is to prove the truth that Tom was in town, it is hearsay.

I don't see how that is at all similar to ""Gerry Adams told me to kill XYZ""

EDIT
P.S. Arresting someone means 

""An arrest is the act of depriving a person of his or her liberty usually in relation to the purported investigation or prevention of crime and presenting (the arrestee) to a procedure as part of the criminal justice system.""

true,Callduron,null,null,"CVs need to do three things:

Step 1: (probably) an automated program will screen your cv for keywords. If the keywords aren't there your cv will be auto-rejected. You can find the keywords in adverts for staff of the particular profession.

Step 2: a human will skim your cv (and possibly dozens of others) to check you tick all the boxes. Try to evidence what they're looking for in either the cv or cover letter. If there's something they want you don't have put down (eg) I am keen to learn the FRUIT stock inventory management system if they say they want people who know that. Don't lie but try to put something positive that covers each point on the person spec.

Step 3: someone will interview you with reference to your cv. So you need to know your cv really well and be prepared to answer the questions that arise from it. Ages ago I worked in Kenya and I don't usually put that on cv/apps. However if I do it's extremely likely that I will be asked about it because it's unusual and a bit more interesting than most employment history. So choosing to put certain things on can shape the interview and help present you well. It's at this stage that you'll really be found out if you just concocted some keyword dense cv to beat the auto-screening - it needs to read like an interesting story, the life story of a great barman (or whatever)

For example Tesco's Croydon Jan 13 - Jul 13

I served the public on the tills bagging their shopping receiving great feedback and job satisfaction. I maintained stock levels with meticulous attention to detail. I handled cash with scrupulous accuracy. After 4 months I was moved to a new role handling customer service complaints in recognition of my excellent rapport with our shoppers and my good common sense.

(See that has several useful keywords like cash handling and customer service).

Each time you do an application check the keywords in the job advert appear in your cv or cover letter. You should be able to refine your work descriptions to something better than that tescos thing I just dashed off.

I'd strongly recommend Word format, no photos. If they want a photo include it separately. If you're especially good looking no harm sending a photo anyway but don't put it into the cv, it messes up formatting and some programs.

Keep it short. There's no point putting something incredibly useful and relevant in if it's on page 4. Personally I think most cvs are too long. If you have 10 great selling points why list 10 great selling points and 30 filler?

A quick google search will give you pointers on format and conventional layout, don't try to stand out by using weird formats, stick to the conventional. The information should be outstanding not your 15 point comic sans layout :)

Any public entity that took a blasé attitude toward racial hostility of any kind, including wanton public racial slurs, would be rightly demonized because we live in a society that has progressed from that. That's why we have to talk about a different era in the first place. Because what was acceptable then is not now.

So fine, maybe you don't personally care about the use of racial slurs. That's fine in private, but (I would hope) as soon as that becomes public, we as a society would say there's no place here for those words or the ideas and values they represent. 

&gt; in an unbroadcast segment that was never intended to be seen

And that's fine as long as it remains unseen. It's childish to think that one's intentions exonerate them from the consequences of their actions. And to Jeremy's credit, he did no such thing. He took the blame and apologized, without at any point trying to justify what he'd done. In a sense, my criticisms lie not with him, but with the people doing what he didn't - trying to claim nothing out of order was done at all.

&gt; There's a world of difference between saying something ""publicly"", and saying something privately

This is essentially my point. Whether or not he intended it to be, what he said has become public, and as you said, there is a world of difference.

&gt; So LET the people who were affected complain

As they are. If no one cared, there'd be nothing happening. Plenty of newspaper stories get ignored and incite no response. Angry at the Guardian?

true,SirMuttley,cnty-uk,British in Bangkok,"Hi Ben, cheers for the blog spam.

&gt; It’s a filter which is enabled by default on all ISP customers’ internet packages on all ISPs that provide it. 

No it's not. Currently you are asked if you want filtering only when you sign up for a new connection. The option to have it is selected by default, but you still need to submit the form before it's enabled and nothing is stopping you from turning it off before you do that.

&gt; Now let’s just imagine the government decide to take that option away; which in the modern age of censorship is very possible. 

The government can't just decide to take it away without enacting legislation that would need to be voted in by our elected representatives. Currently there is no legislation for it, it's a gentleman's agreement with some of the big ISPs. A number of ISPs have vowed never to filter unless the law requires it.

&gt; There’s lots of great free solutions; BlueCoat’s K9 Web Protection for example on Windows and OpenDNS for cross-platform network-level filtration. 

With the wide range of devices now available gone are the days of the family PC sitting in the corner. So it's not hard to see the advantage patents would find in a single solution that works for any device connected to their broadband connection. They don't need to install or maintain it.

&gt; Another concern is the issue of false-positives

Truly a concern but seems a little conflicting with your previous statement about platform level filtering which can suffer from this issue just as much.

Personally the only issue I have with the filtering is the selected by default on sign up. I think the option should have no default selection and if they choose to filter then a disclaimer should be provided that this is just a tool to help parents police their children's internet usage and shouldn't replace good parenting practise.

I don't see it as a form of trying to censor the internet but just a way to appease the DM readers.

My personal favorite is an [italianbeef](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_beef) sandwich from Portillos. You can't get them anywhere else and the rest of the country has not even heard of them but they are delicious. Chicago is also known for its deep dish pizza. Go to one of three places if you can, Lou Malnati's, Gino's East, or Giordano's. If you like banana Cream pie, Bandera on Michigan Avenue has the best banana cream pie you will ever have. It has sort of a spanish feel to its food and they have amazing rotisserie chicken and some great other food as well. Another place to recommend is on the north side called Kuma's corner. Its a small place that plays metal music but they have some of the greatest burgers around. There are always huge lines though so get there at 11 right when it opens if you want to go. 

I'm a diehard Cubs fan so I always recommend seeing a baseball game at Wrigley Field.

&gt;

&gt;An __Italian beef__ is a [sandwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich) of thin slices of seasoned [roast beef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_beef), dripping with meat juices, on a dense, long [Italian-style roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_bread), which originated in [Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago) where its history dates back at least to the 1930s.  The bread itself is often dipped (or double-dipped) into the juices the meat is cooked in, and the sandwich is typically topped off with Chicago-style [giardiniera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giardiniera) (called ""hot"") or sauteed, green [Italian sweet peppers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_sweet_pepper) (called ""sweet"").

&gt;Italian beef sandwiches can be found at most [hot dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago-style_hot_dog) stands and small Italian-American restaurants in northeastern [Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois), [Northwest Indiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Indiana) and [Indianapolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis). However, Chicago expatriates have opened restaurants across the country serving Italian beef, [Chicago-style hot dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago-style_hot_dog), and other foods original to the Chicago area.

true,Callduron,null,null,"This is true in that by any measurable metrics athletes perform better. When Roger Bannister ran a 4 minute mile it made history, now he wouldn't even get in the squad.

However football is also relational. A great dribbler ghosting past a great tackler is not inherently more interesting that a good dribbler ghosting past a good tackler. Because of that some of the interest in football is in how much a team or a player stands out.

My dad had the privilege of working with Man U on some adverts in the 60s and got first hand experience of Best. In the practice games he was the best player in every position - he was a better goalie than the proper goalie even. One exercise they tried to put rules in to stop him dribbling - each player was only allowed 2 touches. So best would take a pass, bounce it off a defender's shin, take the ball again, bounce it off the next defender's shin and dribble through the defence that way. He was magical.

At our club we've had some utterly amazing players. Keegan did the impossible with his headers. No man so short should have been able to constantly beat bigger defenders and head the ball with such power. He inspired a generation of strikers. Dalglish had his patented stick the bum in technique that turned defender after defender. 60 000 people would hold their breaths when the ball was passed to him. Barnes dribbled like absolutely no one else of his generation. Fowler taught us to adore tap ins.

There's a lot to admire and relish in the older generation because the interest of the game is seeing a man or team of men beat other men with skill and work.",0,1399182623,null,0,false,0,ch92qxz,t3_24n4wg,t1_ch92qxz,t1_ch8u4ft,null,1433642498,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

We were absolute dogshit throughout the 90's and early 2000's, a lot of it through incompetence at board level. We had some proper shit teams during this time but also stars like Jurgen Klinsmann and David Ginola. It wasn't until ENIC and Daniel Levy took over from Alan Sugar that we started to a rise. The appointment of Martin Jol in 2004 following Santini's dismissal was the turning point, and since then we have been a proper top 6 side.

It's crazy being a Spurs supporter. We go through every motion known to man. We have some of the best support in the country, even if the atmosphere has been a little flat over the past couple seasons.

Reus I can't see leaving Dortmund at the same time as they're being forced to let Lewandowski leave on a Bosman. Especially as Dortmund are reportedly trying to negotiate a new deal with him that wouldn't include a release clause.

Shaw would be ideal but he's going to be the hot transfer target this summer for upper echelon PL clubs. Which means both his transfer fee and wages will be vastly inflated so we should look elsewhere for another option.

Lallana could be a realistic optional but again it'll come down to the price and his demands. Especially since if Southampton sell Shaw they'll have plenty of £ and will be less inclined to sell forcing up the fee. Not to mention the World Cup factor if he had a decent tournament.

Konoplyanka would be ideal assuming the £15m fee being thrown around previously is accurate.

I'm not commenting on whether or not he should have been sacked, but people insisting he did nothing wrong are clearly speaking from a privileged perspective where of course they find nothing bad about the word because it doesn't denigrate them or their entire race to second-class status and was commonly used whilst their ancestors were being systematically enslaved, raped and murdered for the colour of their skin.

Jeremy clarkson is a powerhouse, a massive figurehead of the BBC. Not a standard private corporation. The BBC is supposed to set a normative standard in channels, yet when one of their biggest figureheads persistently comes out with offensive slurs (this wasn't an isolated incident), then of course it has to be looked down upon. Are we going to say he did nothing wrong because the mild enjoyment he gained from repeating the n-word supersedes the harm he's causing in further adding to the systematic isolation and marginalisation of black people? This test certainly doesn't pass the Millian harm principle, meaning any basic utilitarian could tell you clarkson was wrong here, let alone the moral absolutists who could argue from a different point.

If you're randomly picking a PL team out of a hat to support, it probably shouldn't be spurs. There's no benefit. They dont accomplish anything.

You spent 100m this past summer and 10m of it was actually spent on a good player. You brought over the spanish leagues 4th highest goal scorer in the past 5 years (behind Messi, Ronaldo and Negredo) and have managed to get 2 goals from open play out of him, Spurs made him awful.

You also signed a promising young Argentine forward and have completely stalled his development. He's been injured and then just completely gone, no one saw him or knew where he was. He got 9 appearances and didn't score at all. You lost all three matches to Arsenal this year and failed to score a goal in any of them, you also lost three matches to West ham, who are bad.

There's a bunch of political posturing and bluster here, but it's not obvious that Sinn Fein is too scared by this.  If they were really worried about Gerry spending time in Crumlin Road jail,  he could have stayed across the border in the Republic. As it is, Gerry crossed the border to give himself up - they're gambling that he'll get out without being charged and that will help clear his name for the upcoming elections. The bluster by Mcguinness and the demonstrations are just some high-profile flak aimed at making the police officers in charge be more inclined to think 'enough is enough, it' s too much hassle to keep Gerry here compared to the likelihood of a result'. You might object to this sort of thing, but it's politics as usual, not terrorism.

true,LlamaExpert,num1,,"Chicago lifer here. You can't go wrong with any of the museums, they are all fantastic. I would, however, avoid Navy Pier unless you are going specifically for an architectural boat tour (a must, considering architecture is one of the city's highlights) or to see a show at the Shakespeare Theatre. There are also great [kayak tours](http://blog.thompsonhotels.com/r100/content/uploads/2013/12/kayak-2.jpg) that end downtown.

Any Chicagoan could go for ages on what's good for the edibles, and fortunately for newbies there is a surplus of great stuff. For deep dish pizza Lou Malnatti's and Giordanno's are both great, but my personal favorite is Pequod's Pizza (sidenote: avoid the more touristy places like Pizzeria Uno, Due, Gino's East). Greek Town has some great Greek restaurants that are worth looking into such as Santorini (if you prefer seafood) and Greek Isles. Kuma's is also an absolute must, voted by many publications as one of the best burgers in the country. Hot Doug's is also one of the best hot dog places in the entire country (you can get a foie gras-dog, alligator sausage, duck-fat fries, the list goes on and on...).

If you go see a Cubs game, do your best to get bleacher tickets. Sitting with a bunch of rowdy drunks and heckling the players adds so much enjoyment to what is commonly viewed as a boring sport. The Cubs are pretty similar to Spurs in that both teams have some of the most tortured and loyal fanbases yet always sell out their respective venues (the masochism associated with being a Cubs supporter probably brought me to Spurs in the first place).

As you can imagine, there are also plenty of nightlife options. Wrigleyville is home to the [""douchiest"" bars](http://www.complex.com/city-guide/2012/04/the-25-douchiest-bars-in-chicago#1), but honestly most complaints are overblown and it can be a good time if you're with a good group. Wicker Park contains some of the more hipster-minded bars, and most of them are pretty great and surrounded by great food options. I'm personally a big fan of the Half Acre Brew Pub: the beer is great, you can bring food with you, and there are other decent bars on Lincoln Avenue. WARNING: The Globe may be rated the best footy bar in the Midwest, but it is a Gooner hive (my friends wanted to stop by one night I was wearing my Spurs kit as somewhat of a joke and no one was a jerk, but you never know). [This](http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/February-2013/Best-Bars-in-Chicago-2013/) might also be useful because my views are extremely limited and there are so many places to visit.

Also stop by The Atlantic before the Spurs/Fire game, it's the Chicago Spurs bar and IIRC they have a shuttle to the game.

I'm sorry, but I can't really say anything about the Chicago Fire. I've been to Toyota Park and it's alright, but unfortunately it's a little out of the way from the more interesting stuff in the city.

true,AimHere,null,null,"&gt;Terrorism is using violence and intimidation to get your own way. Threatening to go back to how things were in NI is absolute using intimidation, people's memories aren't so short that they can't remember how frightening that was. 

This is not what's happening here. The threat is that Sinn Fein withdraws from the policing board and stops being so rabidly pro-PSNI as before. That's a far cry from 'bringing the troubles back'. You're panicking, as I said before.

&gt; Sinn Fein threatening to destabilise the police and political status quo is

Well Sinn Fein are not going to be dismantling the Northern Ireland Assembly, or any of the Good Friday Agreement institutions or go back to war any time soon; they're actually *winning* that game as much as any nationalist can be expected to; the political status quo is going to be largely intact, even if Sinn Fein carries out their threats. Sinn Fein would have to be utter morons to upset the status quo, and they're currently the cleverest politicians in Northern Ireland (or maybe the least-stupid), not the stupidest.

As for 'destabilizing the police' - the police should not be above criticism in a democratic society, and they're not always the good guys. Over the length of the Troubles, Northern Ireland has had half it's political class vehemently criticising the work of the police force, often with good reason, and refusing to cooperate and that (by itself) wasn't the end of the world. We're not talking about shooting at them now, if these threats are carried out (and they likely won't be), all that you'll get is a bunch more demonstrations and complaints from one side of the community. To add to the complaints that they're now getting from the dissident loyalist fringes (those flag protester types currently use the term 'PSNIRA' a lot). Hardly the end of the world.

&gt;If a jail sentence for murder was so terrifyingly awful for Gerry Adams, maybe he shouldn't have been murdering people. 

Agreed. But there's two things wrong with that. 

The first is that he's not been charged or convicted of any such crime yet. He may be innocent - there are issues with the evidence that we know the police have (in that a lot of it is hearsay, by dead people, who were opposed to Adams when they said it, and possibly some of it was anonymised too, making it hard to use in court). 

Secondly, he's NOT that scared of the jailtime, as I said before. Sure Sinn Fein and Gerry Adams would prefer there to be no charges brought, but they took a calculated risk by cooperating with the police here; they figure that the PSNI won't charge him, which actually works in their favour. And these threats you're terrified of aren't really anything more than loud noises intended to encourage the police towards releasing Adams.",1,1399193030,null,0,false,0,ch94yym,t3_24npjj,t1_ch94yym,t1_ch94rts,null,1433643613,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

The phrase I used was correctly spelled. The very fact that you're using libertarian (which I am not) as an insult betrays how fundamentally idiotic you are. No amount of name dropping will change that.

Now let me, in short phrases, unbolded because that's racist I guess, tell you what was in the bold part :

*  You claim that the word nigger represents an evil morality blabla
*  Therefore the word nigger needs to be censored
*  Because the freedom of speech does not apply to hate speech
*  Hate speech is arbitrary decided
*  My question - if the word nigger is so bad that it needs to be censored and not uttered, why do black people use it so much?

You answer that last question for me if you can. Then you can dance around UN conventions and drop names like a boss.

&gt;It's also possible to oppress people verbally, to abuse them , bully them and destroy their lives without taking physical action

Again, I agree with you that it's possible to abuse verbally.
It's possible to destroy their lives without taking physical action.

Which is exactly what you're doing to Clarkson, a **man who mumbled a ""bad word"" from an old nursery"" rhyme, using slippery slope fallacy as justification**. You're the one doing the the coming.

&gt;) Your use of a slippery slope fallacy is a fallacy. I didn't say x will lead to Y. I asked you at what point was it okay, in your eyes, to complain about someone abusing me. 

You are misunderstanding what exactly is the fallacious in your argument. It's the notion of **abuse**. First it became physical, then verbal, and then that whole abuse is condensed in one word. One word. No context. Not directed to anyone. Furthermore, your view on the usage of that word is inconsistent at best. See above points.

&gt;Niemoller

Oh snap, here it comes, the great arsenal of every bleeding heart. ""First they came"". Let me tell you something, as someone from post-communist countries. Communism did damage to my nation in ways you couldn't even imagine. And my nation had the best implementation of communism that has ever been. So there's this running joke in the Slavlands 
&gt;First they came for the Communists, then drug (comrade) Jovan stopped them dead in their tracks. Filthy fascists. Month later, drug Jovan was sent to Goli Otok (gulag).

It hillarious for a bystander, not so hillarious for drug Jovan. The entire point of this (humorous) spin of this story is that just because one group face oppression, does not give them the right to oppress. And your entire usage of this poem is highly hypocritical. The ones who are doing the coming are ""human rights"" groups. You use that whole ""First they came"" as a justification for you coming to censor other people's opinion because it 

a)it abuses you 
b)it's going to get more extreme

And don't you try to dance around the latter. You heavily implied that by letting Clarkson ""get away with it"" (framing it as if he is guilty of some terrible crime) you'd hang on a noose. You wouldn't. This is the entire premise of your ""when should I be concerned"". So let me copy paste what I told you before 

&gt;Just because you ancestors were targeted with the oppression because of their skin color, and/or just because you were targeted with oppression because of your skin color, you have no right to censor other's right to say what he wants because you feel that it might end with you on a stake. The only thing that you have a right to do is to stop the angry mob from burning you at a stake.

There's your answer. Complain when the actual damage is done. Not when (and I can't stress this hard enough) **one man recites an old nursery rhyme and mumbles the evil and oppressive word**. 

Can words be used to abuse? Yes. Can they be used to destroy lives? Yes. 

Firstly, words have powers only when the person on the receiving end believes in them OR when other people act upon them. In latter, you can only condemn the action, and not the thought behind it. In the former, you **should not** ask for any legal protection. You have no right to censor words because it hurts your feelings. Face like the others the pain that is harmless. 

Secondly, let's go around policing words, good idea. What words do we police? Nigger, sure. Cunt, bastard, chink, slate? Wait, why exactly are we doing this again? Because certain words have immeasurable power to destroy? But which ones? This is a great problem because unlike physical violence, this isn't objective. If a person A calls person B a nigger and then person B calls person A a racist (equally offensive word that carries a stigma of social suicide), who is more offended? Who goes to jail? This hypersensitive atmosphere creates a generation of cowards and adult babies. Not to mention how this abuses the freedom of speech.

Okay you say, let's censor some words. Now we have some words that are criminal. This essentially means that the group those words are directed against has **greater** protection by the law. This means that the laws are **unequal** and unfair. When a white person beating a black person is classified as hate crime and black person beating a white person is classified as a random beating, you have inequality before the law. 

&gt; if words weren't powerful in causing or influencing action why did the US presidential elections surpass all spending records on delivering words and content in favour of( and sometimes against) candidates. if words didn't set the conditions and cognitive responses for human behaviour then why bother?

It is precisely because words are powerful that the right to free speech must be protected. You do not get to decide which word is Hitler and censor it accordingly. I've said it again and I'm going to repeat that.


&gt;we didn't treat humans as equals

Nowhere does it states that humans are to be treated as equals. All humans are to be treated as equals **before the goddamn law**. When you censor one group saying one word, and not do the same for everyone, you have inequality before the law. You are essentially applying UNoHR to societal sphere where inequality is constant to justify even more inequality before the law in favour of certain races. 



Now let me give you a brief summary of what you're doing.
You're emotionally charging one word with all the bad things done to your race. Then you use this very use as justification in achieving greater protection by the law (hate crime/speech, and I've never seen a hate crime directed towards a white get classified as such). When confronted with this fact you dance around slippery slope fallacies (yes but if we allow him to say this, I'll end on a noose, bad whitey) or you appeal to emotions (First they said nigger, then they killed niggers, bad whitey) or you even abuse definitions (UDoHR says that we are all equals before the law, let's censor the whitey) or you name drop a few poets/philosophers/whatever to further your appeals to emotion (the very usage of Niemoller infuriates me to a degree you cannot even comprehend because I lived under a communistic regime). These are all the four things that you can do to avoid confronting the facts.

true,ZFree2013,null,null,"Problem is, as with most of these transfer stories surrounding Liverpool after we said we had money to spend,  he has not *actually* said that has he.
 
He says he will need six players to bulk out his squad and add depth. 

Then he talks about how it is now easier to attract and purchase top players and talks about how in contrast to last season when players would decline to join, even though they could see what he was trying to build.

So, In actuality, there is no number ever placed on the amount of 'best' signings he will make, but rather he says he will probably need about six players, and makes it clear that he will be looking to bring in some top talent, but nowhere does it make clear that all six will be super buys. 

These articles annoy me because ever since the club has announced we have money to spend and that the club will not look the same,  a lot of supporters I know in real life, now think we are going to sign a whole team of megastars, And guess who's fault it will be if after all the talk Brendan does not buy more than one or two house hold names? His of course, so thus the barrage of ""I would have brought him"" or ""Brendan is a good manager but does not know how to buy, look at city"" will ensue.

Also, what is this crap about Brendan calming down after the match, 

&gt;Rodgers has made his peace with José Mourinho, recognised the fact that it is his responsibility to find attacking solutions rather than complaining about Chelsea setting themselves up so defensively, and accepted that his **ungenerous reaction** to last week's defeat at Anfield was born of exasperation due to what was at stake.

Someone is going to have to let me know what that is about, because frankly, I never hear these sorts of reactions from tabloids when media favoured managers make comments on other teams, to my knowledge he just said that his team actually like to attack, and might have had a sly dig at Chelsea, but it was hardly like they go on to make out in that article.

Also, why is it Rodgers job to find attacking solutions, when the goal that changed the complex of the game was pure bad luck. 

News papers annoy me. (~_~;).

I have a few facebook friends that are staunch republicans or loyalists, and they use their profile as a sort of propaganda machine.  They'll nit-pick whatever they can to make one ideology look better than the other, and if that fails, they'll just post unflattering news about the other side.

true,SouthLondonPirate,null,null,"Goalkeeper - solid, Adrian cemented number 1, Jussi as no. 2

Defence - Left-back has looked shaky at times, although McCartney has been mostly solid he's getting on a bit.  Armero looks promising but seems to a be a bit rash at times, as shown with his foul that won the game for Palace.  

Centrebacks - Reid, Collins and Tomkins are all solid.  Maybe one more decent reserve as Roger Johnson doesn't cut it in the premier league.

Right back - Personally I think Demel has been extremely solid this year, but as with a lot of players under big Sam, he's also getting on a bit.

Central midfield - Despite his critics, I think Taylor has played well recently, always puts in a shift, as does Noble obviously.  Nolan has had his major ups and downs, but when we needed him most he performed, scoring vital goals in February, and he plays well off Andy Carroll.  Diame has been inconsistent this season but has moments of incredible quality.  I think he needs to be played more centrally, instead of out wide where Sam has recently been pushing him.

Wingers - Jarvis and Downing are both good players on their day, but need some competition in the squad I think.  A top quality winger is needed so that they have to fight more for their place in the squad if they are to be kept.

Forwards - Andy Carroll is un-defendable on his day, but his injury meant he hasn't had much chance to prove that.  However, he's not a goalscorer, so I think we need something different to throw at the opposition if it simply isn't his day, and the standard tactics aren't working.  Someone like Remy or Michu, who can bag some goals.  Could Ravel Morrison be the answer? I don't think he fits well in our team, which is a shame as he is such a top quality player.  Whereas Nolan feeds off Andy Carroll's knockdowns, Morrison is much more creative and doesn't fill that role.  I think we need to keep him, but I'm worried Sam won't adapt the team enough to use him wisely.  Carlton Cole, as much as I love him, isn't good enough to be relied on if Carroll is injured.  Vaz Te is also an excellent championship striker, but nowhere near premier league standard.

&gt;libertarian (which I am not) as an insult 

Well generally Libertarians tend to have read Ayn Rand and then forgotten how to read. They have as much knowledge of Liberty as a contested concept nail has of sunshine. You're not one. Congratulations. Try not to poorly imitate one. 

And I'm quite happy to trade insults, but usually what happens is you write a load of nonsense and insult me, because I have no time for people who act as front runners for bigotry I make fun of you and you explode in a ball of rage - which is what your post read like. 

I also tend to double down on hypocrits. So here's how we do this. If you're going to pull out your experience in some ex-soviet state, konechno, that's a lived experience - kudos. BUT you don't get to invalidate my lived experience. SO - you want to keep your soviet era stories go for it - I get to keep Combat 18 hunting me down. Thus that invalidates what is most of your argument to be honest. I also have no time for the Samizdat employed by certain groups who like to pick a fight with people colour. 



Now. Let's do claims. I'm a trained social scientist.I'm not a logical positivist. There's a reason for that because logical postivism fails  when it comes to explanations for human action and social interaction. What I am is someone who is on the border of critical realism and the phenomenological approaches. 

I'm telling you this because it might help you understand why I read some of your comments with a raised eyebrow and chuckle. I'll come to your abuse of the Organon later if I can be bothered. 

Let's clear up some claims: 


&gt;  You claim that the word nigger represents an evil morality blabla

Aside from the childishness of the phrasing, you completely misunderstand the point. 

The word is evil because of the social history and the connotation attached to it. It's not because someone decided that ""hey I know.. today we decide nigger is bad"".  ""Nigger"" to many black people was and still is offensive because it was used to label them as sub human. It still is, it hasn't gone away. It isn't something that we dropped because it became unfashionable because we all suddenly discovered the internet and Beyonce.


&gt;  Therefore the word nigger needs to be censored

Actually I never said that, what I said was the defence of his use of that word, on our ( the taxpayer's) account makes it a public issue. Scroll through what I've said I've never asked Clarkson to be banned. What I do take issue with is that people who complain about his use of the word - on a publicly funded platform and our clock - are the ones being targetted for abuse - when the questions should be asked of a) him and b) the supporting staff and his bosses.

Freedom of speech is fine, but a public servant on the payroll of a publicly funded body that is supposed to be held account by the entire UK population has responsibilities to the people who own it - us. Thus when it does something that goes against our accepted moral norms we need to be questioning it - about why Clarkson did this. 

Why? Because accepting Clarkson's use lends tacit support to it being acceptable that the BBC holds those views, and WE as a society don't. This is called a social contract and it is emergent from our democracy  - we voted for a people who wrote this stuff into law.

&gt;  Because the freedom of speech does not apply to hate speech

Freedom of Speech isn't absolute in the UK. Some people may want to argue that from a moral standpoint - and you're welcome to. But we've got limits on our free speech - again this is an accepted norm that we have in our society - ie people who we voted for put into law


&gt; Hate speech is arbitrary decided

All norms are decided be society coming to agreement, that's how we come up with the concepts of laws, rules and regulations - that's how society evolves.  In this case we put together a body of law based on the norms we want to live our society by and those are in the European Human Rights Convention. 

&gt; My question - if the word nigger is so bad that it needs to be censored and not uttered, why do black people use it so much?

See , you go on about logical fallacy and then you commit a logical category error. 

A word being bad is a different category from black people using it. One is normative or is something bad yes/no. The second part ""why do they use it"" is actually about causality. 

You're conflating two different arguments, you're also assuming that black people using it validates wether it is ""good"" or not - lol - which is a logical fallacy - again. 

But I'll let you off the hook - because I'm not a logical positivist and I'll allow you to be  a complex mixed up human being. 

The argument about whether ""Nigger"" is  bad or good word, is in the majority that it's a racial slur. From both black communities and others. It's not really up for debate - even if those that hide behind this to justify their use of it try to make it so. 

The use of it by black communities is an interesting concept - and you know what there's a huge debate amongst black academics, writers, artists and politicians about the usage.

Have you asked them? I mean it is the internet, and I'm sure there's this google thingamajig, have you explored what all these people think about the usage and why it is used? 

Here's a radical plan - why don't you step away from whatever forum you usually hang out in, and explore the internet for answers. ",0,1399200701,null,0,false,0,ch962q1,t3_24m1xa,t1_ch962q1,t1_ch952u2,null,1433644133,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,JoelDalais,,IBWT,"&gt;How do crypto-currencies challenge mainstream financial systems? 

The point is not to **challenge** traditional financial systems, but to **ignore** them.

&gt;Is Bitcoin a safe alternative to fiat money? 

Depends on your point of view. If by safe (fiat) you mean, will it retain value if I hide it under my mattress = no (its still subject to inflation/hyperinflation), all fiat currencies have a 100% failure rate.

If you mean 'safe' because you gave it to a bank, then most definitely no. By giving it to a bank you are giving it away, it no longer belongs to you, and the banks will 100% gamble with it.

So, whilst Bitcoin has some 'security' issues (its actually us humans that have the security issues, Bitcoin itself is safe), it is still far safer than fiat (imho).

&gt;Is Bitcoin a currency or a commodity and which outlook is more favourable to its long-term survival? 

Both, and more. The 'more' bit is why its long term survival is pretty certain. Voting, contracts, currency, commodity, library, DACs, etc.

&gt;What conditions do we need to create to encourage the mass adoption of Bitcoin? 

Easier UI and 3rd party security for those who don't have time for it.

&gt;Will the emergence of crypto-currencies force government-backed fiat currencies to innovate? Is 2014 the breakout year for Bitcoin?

Yes and yes/no.

See the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eeny%2C_meeny%2C_miny%2C_moe) page. Variations on the second line include ""catch a tiger by the toe"", ""Put the baby on the po"", ""Catch a mangi by the tangi"", ""Barcelona, bona, strike"", ""Bascalora, bora, bite"" and more.

It's unsurprising that in the old racist culture this poem picked up a particularly common variant with a racist word in it, but it's really just a sequence of meaningless words.

Personally, I think that when there are no words that are recognised as racist - when any left-over racist words need to be explained because no-one even knows they're racist any more - that'll be a good clue that racism itself is history.

Very often, political correctness is used as a weapon to bully people who really didn't do anything wrong. As such, it's no better than racism.

It's hard to be sympathetic to Clarkson, but this isn't just about Clarkson. If it's OK to attack Clarkson for not quite managing to filter a rhyme with no meaning well enough to avoid offending people, that reinforces a pattern that'll be used to attack other people too.

It wasn't Episcopalians who took 200 school-girls into slavery last week.  

I don't know whether The Quran endorses rape, but there *is* a worrying number of stories regarding how girls and women are treated in Islamic nations or by Muslim groups.

Edit:  [From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Islam)

&gt;Zina [religious crime] cannot be alleged by any woman or man without four male Muslim eyewitnesses or without confession in court by the man who committed zina.[81][82][87] This sharia requirement of four eyewitnesses severely limits a woman's ability to press rape charges, a crime often committed without eyewitnesses.[81][88][89]

&gt;While a sunnah suggests that a woman should not be punished for having been coerced into having sex,[91] it is the burden of the victim to establish coercion with eyewitnesses. If a man does confesses to zina, eyewitnesses are not required.[92] Such a confession may, however, be withdrawn and the need for four male Muslim eyewitnesses reinstated. Failure to provide evidence is treated as a crime of false accusation, punishable with flogging.[93] Currently, it is common for a Muslim woman who makes a claim of rape not only to be denied justice but to be charged with fornication or adultery.[94][95][96][97]

&gt;Several Islamic countries, such as Morocco (Penal Code Article 475), allow rapists to avoid criminal prosecution if they marry their victim. In 2012, a 16 year-old Moroccan girl, having been forced by her family and the government prosecutor to marry her rapist – and, subsequently, having endured the rapist's abuse – committed suicide by swallowing rat poison.[98] Morocco’s parliament proposed to revise its Article 475 in 2013. Other Islamic nations with similar laws that protect the rapist in this manner include Lebanon (Article 514), Algeria, Jordan, Afghanistan and Pakistan.[99][100][101][102] There is a disagreement whether this practice is sanctioned by Islam or part of local custom.[103][104]

Edit:  Got this from [a site critical of Islam](http://www.answeringmuslims.com/2014/02/does-islam-allow-muslims-to-rape-female.html), but does anyone want to dispute that these are actual quotes?

&gt;Sahih Muslim 3371—We went out with Allah’s Messenger on the expedition to the Bi’l-Mustaliq and took captive some excellent Arab women; and we desired them, for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but at the same time) we also desired ransom for them. So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing azl (withdrawing the male sexual organ before emission of semen to avoid conception). But we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah’s Messenger is amongst us; why not ask him? So we asked Allah’s Messenger, and he said: It does not matter if you do not do it, for every soul that is to be born up to the Day of Resurrection will be born.

&gt;Sunan Abu Dawud 2150—The Apostle of Allah sent a military expedition to Awtas on the occasion of the battle of Hunain. They met their enemy and fought with them. They defeated them and took them captives. Some of the Companions of the Apostle of Allah were reluctant to have intercourse with the female captives in the presence of their husbands who were unbelievers. So Allah, the Exalted, sent down the Qur’anic verse: “And all married women (are forbidden) unto you save those (captives) whom your right hands possess.” That is to say, they are lawful for them when they complete their waiting period. 

Edit II:  Not rape, but interesting.  [An interesting post on /r/islam yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/24lhof/how_do_i_not_hate_my_brothers_and_sisters_in/) - 

&gt;The kafir are honestly right for the most part when they say Muslims treat women poorly. We do, and frankly it's a disgrace. Every Arab woman I've befriended has told me she felt oppressed by her family and she can't live her life the way she wants to, even within the bounds of Islam. I know a brilliant woman who cries herself to sleep every other night because her parents decided she didn't need to finish her high school education, let alone to to college. She may have been at the top of her class, but the traditional thing to do is to be a god damn maid for her parents. Another girl weeps because her parents won't let her marry anybody but one of her father's buddies from Iraq, and she isn't getting any younger. Another is called a whore because she answered the door (and with a hijab on). Another is disowned because she wants to do the littlest things by herself, without her parents over her back. It's driving me insane. We have such a big problem with this and I've noticed it more in the Arab community than anywhere else. The stubborn traditionalism of so many people makes me think that they're incredibly lucky to have been born Muslim, because their behavior reminds me of a certain Meccan leader who thought following tradition was more important than following Allah.

Edit III:  Anyone want to explain the downvotes?  In this comment I have cited:

1) Wikipedia

2) The Quran

3) /r/islam 

What more do you expect me to do to find out the answer to a question about Islam?

If you care to invest about £11.00 in return you’ll easily get 30 meals (about 33p per meal) and I’m constantly amazed at how long it takes to ever get bored of eating it and how pleasantly full it makes you feel.

Tarka lentils = £3.00 for 2kg bag (you only need half-a-cup per meal for two)
Cinnamon = £1.00 (6 flakes)
Ground Ginger = £1.00 (1/2 tsp)
Curry Powder =£1.00 (1 tsp)
Chilli Powder =£1.00 (1/2 tsp)
Turmeric = £1.00 (1/2 tsp)
Mustard seed powder = £1.00 (1/2 tsp)
Green Chillis = 60p pkt (use 2)
Garlic = 30p for 2 bulbs (4 cloves crushed)
Onions = 70p per kg    (2 small onions chopped)
Coconut milk = £1.00 per tin (whole tin)

Soak lentil for few hours (overnight!)

To cook
Heat 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil until v hot.
Add garlic, onion, cinnamon, chillis, ginger into oil and stir

Add turmeric, mustard seeds, curry powder, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper

Stir again

Add a little cold water (4 tablespoons)
Add 1/2 tsp chilli powder
Add soaked lentil
Stir
Add 1/2 tin of coconut milk, stir, keep on bubbly medium heat for 10 mins (you may add a bit of veg stock if you’re so inclined at this point)
When liquid is reduced by half add rest of coconut milk turn heat down to heavy simmer.
Check for taste - if lentils are bitty / crunchy just keep cooking on simmer.

The trouble I have with the entire campaign is that it doesn't fit the way my mind works at all. I've worked on and lead improvement initiatives professionally, and the way we've *always* worked is on the basis of finding a problem, finding out why it is, and then suggesting and debating solutions to that problem.

With this independence lark, it's been the opposite way around. Salmond and the SNP's followers have wanted independence from the beginning, and every argument they've provided and every problem they've invented or dug up is purely to support their (fairly unconvincing) solution, which is independence. 

Scotland's got problems, for sure, but nothing I've seen really suggests that independence is likely to be the most effective and safest countermeasure to them.

true,Denswend,null,null,"&gt;Well generally Libertarians tend to have read Ayn Rand and then forgotten how to read. They have as much knowledge of Liberty as a contested concept nail has of sunshine. You're not one. Congratulations. Try not to poorly imitate one.

I have a dislike of Ayn Rand and I don't get where you'd think that I'm a libertarian. The very notion of thinking Ayn Rand and libertarianism are one and the same chills me to the bone. Here's a radical plan - why don't you step away from whatever forum you usually hang out in, and explore the internet for answers.I value three basic freedoms - freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of association. If that makes me libertarian, then I'm one.  

&gt;And I'm quite happy to trade insults, but usually what happens is you write a load of nonsense and insult me, because I have no time for people who act as front runners for bigotry I make fun of you and you explode in a ball of rage - which is what your post read like.

I don't hold any racist views. You may or may not believe me. But your previous posts read like some pathetic emotional bullcrap and I called you on it. I dislike emotional evocative rhetoric. I dislike people who use it even more. 

&gt;I also tend to double down on hypocrits. So here's how we do this. If you're going to pull out your experience in some ex-soviet state, konechno, that's a lived experience - kudos. BUT you don't get to invalidate my lived experience. SO - you want to keep your soviet era stories go for it - I get to keep Combat 18 hunting me down. Thus that invalidates what is most of your argument to be honest. I also have no time for the Samizdat employed by certain groups who like to pick a fight with people colour.

Oh no, you first started the emotional olympics with your two first posts. Then you turned it up to eleven with Niemoller. If you think my post-soviet (it's not soviet) experience is supposed to match your experiences with racism you misunderstud the point. And never do I want to invalidate your experiences and I don't know why you got that idea. The whole point of the story with drug Jovan was that using Niemoller's story about ""First they came"" gives you no moral leeway (and frankly I don't see why you pulled him out). The group that was oppressed yesterday may be doing the oppression tomorrow. It's a fallacy to think fascism only comes in black.  

But if you really want to play Oppression Olympics, I'm down. But I find this whole notion idiotic. 


&gt;Aside from the childishness of the phrasing, you completely misunderstand the point.

To be honest, I apologize if that statement came of as childish. I was lazy (I admit it) to find and write your exact statement.

&gt;The word is evil because of the social history and the connotation attached to it. 

Again. Every single insult has social history and the connotation attached to it. And every insult is meant to be offensive. You simply do not get to draw the line at which insults are to be criminalized. This is what I do have a problem with - **criminalization of insults**.

&gt;""Nigger"" to many black people was and still is offensive because it was used to label them as sub human. It still is, it hasn't gone away.

And ""nigger"" to many black people is used as cordial word. And it's used as a cordial word a lot more than it's used as an insult. So we come to a moot point here. 

&gt;Actually I never said that, what I said was the defence of his use of that word, on our ( the taxpayer's) account makes it a public issue. 

It is precisely because of this that I entered this discussion. If this was private matter I wouldn't condone it, but I would respect freedom of speech and freedom of association.  

The very thing that I'm not liking is that **one man recites an old nursery rhyme and mumbles the evil and oppressive word** and gets an entire witch hunt against him - and to make matters even worse, this is a public issue with the BBC being publicly funded. Freedom of speech applies here. Considering that he **did not insult anyone directly, did not condone racial violence, did not even say it clearly** it's a major breach of free speech in attempt to criminalize mere words. **Criminalization of words is the breach of freedom of speech and I will always find that morally abhorrent, if it's voted in by democracy or brought by autocracy.** What is legal isn't necessarily moral.

&gt;Scroll through what I've said I've never asked Clarkson to be banned.

This is where I may be wrong, but I got the feeling you heavily implied it. And even if you didn't, those human rights groups did.


&gt;Why? Because accepting Clarkson's use lends tacit support to it being acceptable that the BBC holds those views, and WE as a society don't.

Again. Tacit support to what? **One man recites an old nursery rhyme and mumbles the evil and oppressive word**. He did not call anyone a nigger, he did call for any racial violence, he did not even say it clearly. What is this the tacit support to? Mumbling words?

&gt;What I do take issue with is that people who complain about his use of the word - on a publicly funded platform and our clock - are the ones being targetted for abuse

I take issue with the very notion of criminalizing free speech in the form of hate speech. I then take issue to those who would extend this definition of hate speech based on historical (sometime someplace bad people did it) context when it's divorced from its real context (to whom was it said, what words accompanied it, and with what intetion was it said). Then I take issue with the fact that the very people who are supposed to defend the rights of human beings are doing this. Open your mind a bit and put yourself in his shoes and you'll see things more clearly.

&gt;But we've got limits on our free speech - again this is an accepted norm that we have in our society - ie people who we voted for put into law

Okay, you say that there are limits to free speech and then appeal to the authority. I do not buy this right now right here and neither would I buy this in Nazi Germany. Different flavour, same ice cream. See above why. And I simply don't think that the limits on free speech are neccessary to society in general.  

&gt;All norms are decided be society coming to agreement, that's how we come up with the concepts of laws, rules and regulations - that's how society evolves.

This is redundant.

&gt;In this case we put together a body of law based on the norms we want to live our society by and those are in the European Human Rights Convention.

Again.Nowhere does it states that humans are to be treated as equals. All humans are to be treated as equals before the goddamn law. When you censor one group saying one word, and not do the same for everyone, you have inequality before the law. You are essentially applying UNoHR to societal sphere where inequality is constant to justify even more inequality before the law in favour of certain races. You are criminalizing words but doing it in such a manner that some people are penalized, while others are not. Not only is this a breach of freedom of speech, but this is legal inequality - gateway to institutionalized oppression.

&gt;See , you go on about logical fallacy and then you commit a logical category error.
A word being bad is a different category from black people using it. One is normative or is something bad yes/no. The second part ""why do they use it"" is actually about causality.
You're conflating two different arguments, you're also assuming that black people using it validates wether it is ""good"" or not - lol - which is a logical fallacy - again.

No one is saying that the word nigger is not a bad word. If I said it then I apologize for not being clear enough. I said that no word, including nigger, carries such historical and societal bad context that it needs to be censored. The word nigger is an insult. Insults are meant to be offensive. But insults are also words. And with the criminalization of words I have a problem.

Black people using it does not make it magically good. I again apologize if you inferred that from my statements. I was merely saying that if you really really badly want to criminalize words, then penalize everyone equally. And then I questioned your ideas that 

&gt;Meanwhile - you say it's just words. go up to the person you most love in the morning. Abuse them with all the words that you now they hate. Remind them of all their inadequacies and failures, in detail. Tell them they are worthless and you're going to beat them round the head. Do that for hours and hours, loud as you can.

Now as you can see, this is something quite emotionally loaded. All inadequacies and failures condensed in six letters. If this truly was universal consensus about the word nigger, then the word nigger would not be used in a cordial manner. It may be a bad word (an insult) but it's not all inadequacies and failures. 

&gt;See , you go on about logical fallacy and then you commit a logical category error.

This is where you pick my argument apart and attack every part instead of looking at it as a whole. I'll keep things as simple as possible from here on.

&gt;A word being bad is a different category from black people using it. One is normative or is something bad yes/no. The second part ""why do they use it"" is actually about causality.

This is redundant. Sky is blue. Except at night. Then it's black. Or really really dark blue. 

&gt;You're conflating two different arguments, you're also assuming that black people using it validates wether it is ""good"" or not - lol - which is a logical fallacy - again.

Wrong. Let's do it again.

* If the word nigger is so **universally bad it needs to be censored and legally penalized**  (your inadequacies and failures paragraph above) then it would not be used in a cordial manner between blacks.

* The word nigger is used by blacks in cordial manner.

* Therefore the word nigger is not so universally **universally bad it needs to be censored and legally penalized**

This is modus tollens. Basic logic. Those were Stoics and not Aristotle.

Now from this I infer that the context (to whom it was said, what words accompanied it, and with what intetion it was said) is **more important** to the discussion than the historical and societal context that word may have carried.
**One man recites an old nursery rhyme and mumbles the evil and oppressive word.**
He does not say it to anyone. He does not say it insultingly. He says it in a context of an old nursery rhyme. He does not even say it clearly. 

&gt;The argument about whether ""Nigger"" is bad or good word, is in the majority that it's a racial slur. From both black communities and others. It's not really up for debate - even if those that hide behind this to justify their use of it try to make it so. 

Again, recap. The word nigger is an insult based on race. Insults are fundamentally bad words. Insults are therefore words. I have a moral problem with criminalization of words no UN convention will solve by outlawing them. I have even more problem when that criminal penalty is applied inequally. If you want to prohibit whites from saying it, okay, I'll open my mind a bit and let you chip away at the freedom of speech if you find it that much evil (all inadequacies and failures) even without its real context (who said it, to whom it was said, what words accompanied it, and with what intention it was said). But then make sure that you follow the UDoHR and make sure that all are equal before the law. Equal before the law means equal punishment. Because the real context (who to whom, with what intention) does not matter.

&gt;The use of it by black communities is an interesting concept - and you know what there's a huge debate amongst black academics, writers, artists and politicians about the usage.
Have you asked them? I mean it is the internet, and I'm sure there's this google thingamajig, have you explored what all these people think about the usage and why it is used?

No I haven't asked them and I have no intention of doing so. I hold the radical idea that arguments are judged on their own merit, and not on the fundamental characteristics of people who say it. This includes blacks too. I have no intention of specifically asking for a black professor so that he could explain to me how black societies work simply because I don't think that him being black will instantly make him knowledgeable about the life of common black man. I'll find a *good* professor, a published one, I'll read his articles and decide for myself. Whether he is black or white or reptilian makes no difference to me.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Personally, I'm leaning towards a yes vote. I mostly feel this way because my personal opinions, and I feel the opinions of most Scottish people, have diverged from the rest of the UK. I don't say this just because of the current government but because of the trend of the last 30 years. We have different views on immigration, nuclear weapons, the welfare state and renewable energy. We are countries with different views and I don't feel the views of Scottish people are as well represented as they could be. I know a lot of English/Welsh,Northern Irish people will say 'Our views aren't represented either', 'that's democracy these days' etc. But when we have a chance to possibly get a government that represents us better should we say no because you don't get the same privilege? I feel like we are a different country and if the partnership no longer benefits us I don't understand why we should stay.

I do have fears about currency and the economy though. That is why I'm not a full yes. I think we have what it takes to be a successful country but it seems the transitional period could be rough.  My friends and family are pretty split. Those who are more left leaning tend to say they will vote yes. Those who are richer tend to say what is the point in taking the risk? That is just a difference I have noticed among friends. Nobody wants the Euro but people have big doubts about the pound.

There are some daftys also who say they'll vote yes just to 'fuck shit up' and people who say they will vote no because they like supporting team GB at the Olympics. Those seem stupid to me but I feel the people with opinions like that will balance out in the end. What I think will lead to a No vote in the end is people who say 'I'm not politically engaged so I'll vote no' or 'No is the safe vote so I'll go with that'. It kind of annoys me to be honest. I wish they would analyse everything thoroughly and come to a conclusion but what can you do?

Something I'd like to add is my opinion on the reaction of some English people who seem to take this whole thing as a personal insult. The vast majority of us don't hate English people. If we vote yes it doesn't mean we don't like you or are turning our backs on you and it won't be because we hate you. It just means we feel we have grown apart and should go our separate ways. I have no doubt we would continue to be closely linked.

true,Billmk,num2,,"I used to live in Chicago, and have only visited Seattle a couple of times, but here's some things I would recommend:

Chicago: Second Deep Dish Pizza.  Pretty unique to the chicago area, and delicious.  Lincoln Park Zoo is a free zoo, that while small, can be a nice couple of hours.  Millenium park was built after I moved away, but it seems like a pretty cool place, by the lake.  I can't necessarily speak to neighborhoods with good nightlife, because the last time I was there it felt like everything had changed.  I always liked the Boystown/Belmont area or Wicker Park for a night out, but it might be different, or you might be looking for a different time.  

A reminder for tourists.  Chicago is huge.  Don't expect a short 2 minute walk between El stations or between sights. Transit will get you around just fine, it'll take a while though.  

Seattle: Pike's Place Market is very touristy, but fun.  Rent a Kayak and paddle around the lakes and see all the house boats.  Some are ridiculously nice.  Definitely go see the locks where you can see the salmon run.  Take a ferry ride through the sound.  It's a great way to see the city and the sound.  

If you like camping, Olympic National Park is just across the sound and one of my favorite national parks.

Not sure how you can not put the two together to see why it might be a bit of an issue.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"You seem to have missed the point about not using logical positivism to argue social science because it leaves you in big hole.  

Also , I wish people would use fascism and totalitarianism accurately - they aren't the same thing. They share things, but frankly they aren't the same thing. If you wish to take anyone who's actually got a political education followed by a social science one to take you seriously - that would be a good start.

Here's the problem with your position. You're accusing someone of emotional arguments - when a) you can't define a political correctly b) seem to confuse context, society, history and economics and c) have no desire to do so. How do I know this .. well let's start with this:

&gt;All norms are decided be society coming to agreement, that's how we come up with the concepts of laws, rules and regulations - that's how society evolves.

&gt;  &gt;This is redundant.

No it isn't. It's actually the core of what society is. You can go all the way back to Aristotle and locate the notion of the social contract. In fact, you , who are so much in favour on ""Freedom of speech..."" , must realises that these also form a social contract. 

See here is the thing, when Locke argued these things (that's John Locke , 16th Century philosopher) he also argued that a contract existed between society and the individual where those rights had to be protected, but also balanced off. 

It's still a balance of norms that society agrees on. What changes in the constituent framework that empowers the degree to which those norms are accepted. There's about 70 years of social science that proves this. But the idea itself is one that has formed that backbone of political philosophy for years

So your objections are irrelevant and if they'd come from my graduates I'd have to see if I screwed up on the reading list.

&gt;I take issue with the very notion of criminalizing free speech in the form of hate speech. I then take issue to those who would extend this definition of hate speech based on historical (sometime someplace bad people did it) context when it's divorced from its real context (to whom was it said, what words accompanied it, and with what intetion was it said). 

Well, as proven in the various postings , and your complete failure to understand the terminology I am using, or the epistemology, or the ontology of what is presented - you don't really know anything about context.

The word Nigger doesn't just has historic context, it also has a current context -which is informed by everything around it. Context includes time, context includes the changes in reality that make a word symbolic. 

This is why some black people sought to reclaim the words - NOT because they use it ""cordially"" ( really ? you want to call it cordial, I mean English is your second language.. but really? ). I had a friend who worked the civil rights campaigns in the US in the 1970s - and he said people used it in an effort to take it back from the oppressor. 

They believed that  if they owned the word and they took the power out of it, then they could stop their oppressor defining them with it. Now there's a huge argument amongst the black activists of the era and since about whether this was the right thing to do. 

But it had nothing to do with being cordial - it was about reposing to their oppression. It was BECAUSE they saw it as hate speech they wanted to find a response to it. 

This is why your argument that ""ohh black people use it .. therefore it shouldn't be hate speech"" , has no foundation , UNLESS you understand the context within which those people decided that it would be a valid claim to use. 

At no point did any of those debates say , well let's let white people use it as a nursery rhyme because we've reclaimed it. How many African American intellectuals have you met? Have you asked them this question?

So let's bury this bleating that you hear from the right wing infested forums that ""Ohh it's not hate speech because.. "" It is. Everyone knows it is. Arguing that is isn't is just making excuses for its use.

Whether we legisltate for hate speech or not , is an entirely different question from what the hate speech is.  You can take the absolutist view of Freedom Of Speech in some parts of the US. However, in the European political tradition it doesn't work like that.

Hate speech is accepted as existing and we've codified it. You can argue as much as you want that hate speech in of itself ( see Hegel) is not sustainable as a concept - and you'd have strong argument backed by many people across political spaces. 

However, Freedom of Speech doesn't mean freedom from consequences. With that freedom of speech comes the responsibility of the utterance. There in lies the rub. 

We have already established the platform that speech can be abuse - I showed you the case study evidence and the science. We agree that abuse is oppression. 

Thus why should public body that is funded by the taxpayer - thus in a social contract with the taxpayer to obey the norms and values we uphold as a population ( which you may disagree with as an individual) be paying for someone to do this on their clock.

Why is my oppression suddenly less important , than the person who  no one forced utter hate speech, in a public space that I jointly own with a society that says - hate speech is something that has consequences?

and this is why I begin to doubt people like you, you seem to see it as a badge of courage to take people like me on, when you should be asking yourself why a 54 year old man - who's not an old senile man which is hard to believe if you're 20- and a public personality should feel comfortable enough in his position that he can use it as a platform to hurt people.

At what point is it enough Rabi Hillel said ""If not you , then who. If not now, then when?"" This is a genuine question for you.

If the UK govt puts all their stuff 'off balance' through PFI or things like that, it all comes off of the 'identifiable spending' in England by the UK govt, and the Scottish bloc grant gets cut accordingly. For everything that's privatised in England so that the state is spending less, there's less cash for Scotland, which makes it harder for us to continue the same services at the same level.

The major cups/tournaments are 


1. The UEFA Champion's and Europa leagues. These are played between the best clubs in Europe. The Champion's league is the most prestigious cup, it's why everybody is so riled up about getting in the top four. We played in it in the 2010/11 season, which was when Gareth Bale came into his own, resulting in lots of cash and heartbreak for Spurs supporters last summer. Participation in these two leagues is determined by the place you finish in your European league the prior year. The stronger the league, the more spots they have for qualification. The EPL has four spots for the Champion's League. Europa league qualification is more complicated, but us and Everton are currently qualifying. It's Champion's League light. Some people think we waste our time playing in it, since it's less prestigious and our players get worn out playing so many games. I've always thought, if we want to be a Champion's League team we better figure out how to be a Europa League team. 


2. The two major domestic cups are the FA cup and the League Cup. Personally I find the League Cup pointless, although it's invloved in Europa League qulification. You can read it's wiki. The FA cup, is pretty awesome. It's the oldest domestic cup, or something like that, and around 800 teams can qualify for it, all from England and Wales. So, you can wind up having small anonymous teams playing the bigger teams. I think some English/British people would actually rather win the FA cup than the league, any of them reading this can correct me if that's wrong. These cups are also played during the season. So you can be in Europe, two domestic cups, and the Premier League all at the same time. There are no playoffs at the end of the EPL season. The team with the most points at the end wins the league, which is sometimes anti-climatic for Americans. 

That's enough from me for now. Welcome! I'm sorry... And Fuck Arsenal Gooners.

I have issues with the nature of the Westminster electoral system. The way it is at the moment the political opinions of Scottish voters are essentially irrelevant, hence the main parties have no reason to listen to our opinions when it comes to forming their manifestos. The tories aren't interested because they no it doesn't matter how much money they throw at any campaign up here they won't get more than a couple of seats, its much more in their interests to pander to middle England etc. The labour party know this and know that their main competitor in Scottish politics, the SNP, is fairly impotent when it comes to Westminster so have little threat to their seats so don't have to appeal to voters beyond we're not the Tories and the SNP will never govern at Westminster. Combined with the success of the SNP at Holyrood this is causing Scottish politic opinion to diverge from that in England (see the rise of UKIP and attitudes towards austerity and the EU) and is only increasing since the main parties have little reason to court Scottish voters opinions. 

I know that there are plenty of people in Scotland who agree with plenty of the Westminster parties policies but the number of these people seems to be decreasing, hence why there is even a referendum in the first place, as these parties realise how little work they need to put in north of the border. This particular problem could be somewhat eliminated by ditching FTTP voting system but Labour and the Tories know that would destroy their ability to ever win a majority and would seemingly rather trade power on the basis of who can court voters in the swing seats in England better. Reform in this area isn't close to being on the table so I can only see it getting worse. 

Personally I'd rather a fully federal UK with some kind of proportional representation, but since that's not on offer I'll be voting for independence its the only way I see the opinions of Scottish people being taken on board, even if you lean towards the conservatives or labour.

I also want to stay in the EU which Scotland will do and even in the unlikely event we do spend a year or two out that's far more appealing than what the likes of UKIP and some tories are proposing.",0,1399211721,null,0,false,0,ch985db,t3_24os9a,t1_ch985db,t3_24os9a,null,1433645110,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

That's not the problem. What's troubling is that the culprit himself acknowledges his wrongdoing, yet others disregard it. It's like a criminal admitting guilt in the face of evidence, and having people still assert that the person's not guilty.

&gt; some kind moral authority

I'm sorry that that's what was communicated. I was asked to offer my perspective on an issue that directly involves my race. I think it's important to identify that racial discrimination is still present (and not just from the odd lunatic), and that when public attitude is one of defending rather than demonizing instances of racial agitation (because what happened sure wasn't an example of racial inclusiveness), it's indicative of movement backwards rather than forwards.

Stating that I'm black is to communicate that my unease at the situation comes from firsthand experience of said discrimination rather than theoretical musings. It's the same as a girl who has been raped saying so, in order to show that rape does still happen, and that therefore talking about it frivolously shouldn't be considered acceptable by a society that seeks solidarity with its victims.

Um no. They undermined a very valuable taxpayer funded asset, and put at risk an important BBC revenue stream over nothing. Literally over Nnnnnnnja.

Clarkson has an entire career promoting other races and cultures. Top Gear's audience is made of a lot of children and teenagers, exactly the kind of audience you want to show a rich and positive view of world cultures. Top Gear consistently does it in a exciting, humorous and overall positive way. BBC had an opportunity to point out that a career of positive actions paid for by the taxpayer cannot be undone by Nnnnnnnnja.

They also had the opportunity to point out that as a responsible media organization they object to the media gleefully printing ""n-word"" everywhere. There were a handful of people who heard Clarkson say ""nnnnnja"". There are no tens of millions of people including minorities who've had to hear a whole lot of n-words. Not Clarkson's fault. If it wasn't him, it would be somebody else.

The BBC is owned by the public, and Top Gear is an investment which returns quite a high profit. As a purely business decision what they did was stupid.

""The Channel Tunnel – a gigantic construction project  
DMT (Deutsche Montan Technologie) is one of the few German companies that participated on both sides of the Channel in the gigantic Channel Tunnel construction project. This tunnel, which Napoleon had already intended to build for strategic reasons between France and England at the beginning of the 19th century and which has always provoked fears on the British side, is today regarded as a major European project. Thanks to the tunnel, the train journey from London to Paris only takes about four hours. The position and height of the tunnel-driving machines were continually controlled by DMT measuring teams. With the Gyromat, DMT had developed the most rapid and accurate surveying gyroscope in the world. With the help of a special scanning system, the direction of geographic north can be determined from the movements of the gyroscope at every point on or below the Earth’s surface. In the case of underground measurements, the Gyromat ensures successful intersections particularly when – for time and money reasons – the tunnel is started from two sides, which was the case in the Channel Tunnel project.

I started following Spurs the year they qualified for CL, so my second season was the CL run which was incredible. I had to watch matches during classes and do my best to keep my emotions in check. Following Spurs can be so much more than just following a sports team. It's all-consuming if you let it and it's so worth it.

OP should visit portland.  The town is way more awesome and has a much better soccer team and support.  Hell, they have a soccer specific stadium, which is more than seattle can say. ;)

I lived in Portland for a while and visited seattle a couple times, we did the touristy things.  Pikes market, make sure you get there early to catch the fish flinging (if they still do it).  Space needle, I believe there is some hack to get up free, like telling them you are going for dinner/drinks, other wise they charge you... as /u/leonardpeikoff mentioned, you might want to seek advice in /r/seattle 

Depending on when the match is, you will likely be able to catch a good show as there are always good bands rolling through town.  The music is as diverse as the town, so if you want a jammy blue grass band you can probably find one just as easy as finding a good hip hop act.

The pacific northwest is awesome.  Great hikes, awesome scenery, good coffee and beer and some of the best food.  Breakfast/brunch places are the one thing that I miss about living out in that neck of the woods.  I absolutely loved Saturday/Sunday mornings at a small cafe, sitting outside drinking a coffee, enjoying the fresh air and eating some free range chicken eggs rolled up with some crazy pacNW food.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"I actually disagree with the idea that the UK and Scottish political ideology has moved apart. I think they actually remain fairly contiguous, and its largely a matter of localism. For all these notions that the Scots are left leaning socialists with a strong interest in social justice and fairness they're also amongst the most traditional and socially conservative people in the UK.

Some perceived disparities are probably more to do with regional differences. For example immigration is played on a lot in the UK press and to the old lady in Aberdeen it might seem as though the English have turned entirely racist. The flip side is if you live in Birmingham, Slough, London etc. (areas predominantly in the South of England) immigration has been significantly larger and has had a more visible impact on day to day life. I say that as someone who travels between Scotland and the South of England not infrequently - it's true the Scots have had immigration, but they haven't had anywhere near the scale the UK has particularly outside of Edinburgh and Glasgow.

Similarly the position on the economy might seem very divergent - the Scots generally favor tighter regulation of the banking sector and limits on the apparent excesses of its workers. The flip side is if you live in the South of England an astonishingly vast number of people either work in the finance industry or are connected through family or business to it - and are reluctant to start imposing restrictions on the main driver of profitability in the UK... I mean we can talk all day about 1% recoveries in manufacturing but the reality is 77.8% of all UK GDP (including Scotland) came from the services sector in 2014. The recovery has nothing to do with mortgage prices or manufacturing - it is almost entirely due to a significant recovery in confidence throughout the services industry that drives our entire economy and is based predominantly in London and the SoE.

Some other apparent areas of diveregence are also largely dreamt up. Scots didn't want the Iraq war. Well, actually, **[neither did the English](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/2765041.stm)** if you remember.

On the views of Scots being well represented it's a tricky one. I personally think they are better represented than many Scots realise. Bearing in mind of the last 3 prime ministers, one was Scottish and another spent his childhood in Scotland. The problem is, ultimately, that the population of Scotland is very small when compared to the remainder of the UK - and so giving a greater to a minority group is akin to federalizing the UK. Now, Scots might be very keen on that, but I suspect the 85% of the population who live in England might not be so keen to give a minority group a larger stake-holding.

On the perception of independence being a slight against the English, I think ultimately it is. Whilst its noble to say things like *""we've just grown apart""* what it really means between-the-lines is *""Here in Scotland we like justice, social mobility and fairness. You cunts in England like money, old boys clubs and stealing oil""* i.e the inference is that the Scots are holier-than-thou. I don't see how one group ""emancipating"" themselves from an established relationship can be anything other than a slight against the other, especially since the terms of the separation are not mutual - i.e. the UK's official position is it doesn't want this.",0,1399215383,null,0,1399215874,0,ch997r3,t3_24os9a,t1_ch997r3,t1_ch97dla,null,1433645612,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

true,roobens,lfc87,null,"I'd certainly agree with you if you were referencing a football team from the 1950s, but 1989 was only 25 years ago. Yes the state of sports science, knowledge of nutrition, youth development, training methods etc have all come on since then, but enough to discount the fact that those players were in general more talented? Not in my opinion. 

For sure, athletes nowadays are stronger, fitter, and generally all-round better athletes than 25 years ago, but we're talking tiny quantities. Football is a difficult sport to gauge this with because of its team nature and lack objectively measured records (goals scored by single players per season perhaps, but that's still subject to all kinds of bias due to the players around them). But if we look at individual sports like track athletics, we can see that records have been consistently broken over the years, but each time the time is only fractionally better. And that's comparing like for like, i.e. the best of one era against the best of another. The Liverpool comparison isn't the same. In the 80s we were possibly the best team on the planet at various times, and certainly within the top 3-5 at all times. Nowadays we're, well we're not up there despite having had a great season this year. Take another example of individual sport, Mike Tyson in his 1980s prime. Best of the best. Would he struggle against today's best of the best? Possibly yes. Would he struggle against an average boxer? Hell no he'd probably have demolished him. 

TL;DR I agree with your point when comparing like for like, but only to a small degree. When comparing best versus average, I don't really think it holds that much water. 

PS Also, (if you can allow me to indulge in a slightly selfish and snarky aside that's not really directed at you since you gave me a reasonable response), it's fucking hilarious that I'm being downvoted for being able to remember how good that 80s team was. It was phenomenal. I can only assume that some people here downvoting don't even remember that era.

There are tonnes of fans that go out and have some beers and get some poutine. At the games I've been too there have been live music and its a good time. 

As for players to watch TFC is actually a fairly young team. Obviously we have strengthened our squad with Defoe, GIlberto, Bradley and Ceasar  but there are some young exciting Canadians to watch as well. Jonathan Osorio is a fan favourite and an exciting youngster to watch, he naturally plays as a central mid but is often seen out on the wing and sometimes up top. Another young Canadian to look out for is Kyle Bekker, Bekker is a young central mid often seen playing beside Bradley he has the ability to pick out some great balls forward and has an absolute rocket of a shot. Short-listing a few other players you have: 
Jackson, the brazilian winger, pacey and always looking for the run. 
De Rosario, Canadian and TFC Legend.
Alvaro Rey, winger, great winger, can put players on their ass with the dribbles
Henry big, fast, young Canadian defender
and many more....

As for the town, I personally don't spend much time in Toronto but another Canadian should be able to help you out with the Toronto life.

Master slow control and I mean, so you can do a confident, safe U turn on it within 4 metres. It translates the bigger bike. The more you practice on that the easier it will be to ride the bigger bike. 

 I shouldn't have to pay £25 per hour to practice on a bigger bike. For that price I was expecting 1-on-1 training, not one instructor and five students.

I take it this ratio was off the road? But if you're not happy, find another training school. Ask questions like what is your instructor to trainee ratio? Tell your instructor what you're struggling with so they can tailor your training to your needs. 


Surely it would be better to allow learners to ride their own 500cc motorbikes without an instructor?

I'd say maybe off the road. 500CCs are powerful enough to get your into some serious trouble quickly. The point of having an instructor is to help introduce you to those motorcycles safely. If you're still learning then you still need an instructor really. If you think about it you can't just drive a car by yourself when you're classified as a learner either.

And yes, he's not good enough. I know we're not all blessed with your incredible insight, but that's not difficult to see.

And Azpilicueta actually got his original chance in the cup game against Arsenal. I remember Mourinho saying before the game that it was a chance for players to make him change his mind about his first XI. Cole's injury then presented a bigger opportunity. Also, Mourinho chose Azpilicueta over Bertrand, despite him never having played as a left back before. That was how impressed he was with him.

Another important thing to remember is that the injury gave him the chance, but he's impressed so much that when Cole got over his (relatively minor) injury, he wasn't able to get back into the team. If Mourinho was only playing Azpilicueta because his hand is forced, then why would he not put Cole straight back in? Azpilicueta was rewarded for his excellent play, plain and simple.

Never said that they were. The phrase "" It's a fallacy to think fascism only comes in black."" is the one you'd think I don't know the diference. It's just a phrase I heard from a friend and decided to keep.

&gt;You're accusing someone of emotional arguments

Yes. And you are using them. 

&gt;you can't define a political correctly

I don't base my arguments on political correctness. And quite franky I'm not sure what you mean by this paragraph.

&gt;This is redundant

My mistake. Your post (and your whole Lock and social contract 101 paragraph) is redundandt *in this discussion*. Sure, societal contract is a pretty cool thing that lets us have a working civilization. If your plan was to lure me in with cheap emotional rhetoric to make me think I was dealing with another ""check your white privilege"" moron then bombard me with name dropping and basic philosophical term it was a great success. You managed to show off your basic knowledge on social contract. Now add in Foucalt for the killing blow. 

&gt;Well, as proven in the various postings , and your complete failure to understand the terminology I am using, or the epistemology, or the ontology of what is presented - you don't really know anything about context.

Your tone seems to imply that I do not understand your position. I would argue that you do not understand my position. Your definition of context is basically emotinally loading one word with every bad thing done to your race. My definition of context is strictly linguistical - who said it, to whom it was said, what words accompanied it, and what was intention behind it. You argue that the word deprived from my version of context is hate speech. I argue otherwise. I've given you arguments why.

&gt;This is why some black people sought to reclaim the words - NOT because they use it ""cordially"" ( really ? you want to call it cordial, I mean English is your second language.. but really? ).

Yes. Really. They use it cordially. As in friendly. I find it hard to believe that all blacks using nigger is one huge campaign to own words and no longer be offended by them. Especially the common black.

&gt;I had a friend who worked the civil rights campaigns in the US in the 1970s - and he said people used it in an effort to take it back from the oppressor.

A high intellectual and common man are two different things. I doubt the latter is even aware at why he calls other blacks niggas.

&gt;It was BECAUSE they saw it as hate speech they wanted to find a response to it.

GOOD. THANK YOU. THIS IS WHAT I WANTED.

You're saying that black people using certain words is different from white people using certain words. Latter is hate speech and thus not protected by free speech and the former is reaction to the hate speech and thus protected by free speech. So my context matters, namely, who says it. We can agree with it (even though you have a problem with my wording) and **this is very important**.

&gt;At no point did any of those debates say , well let's let white people use it as a nursery rhyme because we've reclaimed it. How many African American intellectuals have you met? Have you asked them this question?

Met them directly? Asked them directly? None. And I have no desire to. I hold the radical idea that arguments are judged on their own merit, and not on the fundamental characteristics of people who say it. This includes blacks too. I have no intention of specifically asking for a black professor so that he could explain to me how black societies work simply because I don't think that him being black will instantly make him knowledgeable about the life of common black man. I'll find a good professor, a published one, I'll read his articles and decide for myself. Whether he is black or white or reptilian makes no difference to me.

But if you do really insist on African Americans, then [I'll point you to my dear friend Thomas Sowell](http://imgur.com/eOXQIAO).

&gt;So let's bury this bleating that you hear from the right wing infested forums that ""Ohh it's not hate speech because.. "" It is. Everyone knows it is. Arguing that is isn't is just making excuses for its use.

Let us not. Because it's not hate speech. But your last sentence only proves how you're no different from a religious zealot. Arguing that a thing can somehow be wrong only makes it more just. Burn a woman at a stake, if she survives then she's a witch, if not then her soul's safe. 

And do you know why it's not hate speech? Because context (or at least my version of it), namely, who says it is important. See above. You basically admitted that. If you want to have social contract, you need to make it fair. If you still want to play by the UN convenctions and have **equal treatment of ALL races by the law** then you either need to have equal punishment for hate speech by a member of ANY race towards member of ANY race or you can simply not criminalize what you call as hate speech. Then I'm down with you. BUT, what you're doing is defining one crime that one group is immune to. Do you see where I'm getting at here? 

&gt;However, Freedom of Speech doesn't mean freedom from consequences. With that freedom of speech comes the responsibility of the utterance. There in lies the rub.

Good, let's go with that. Suppose you call your boss from a private firm a nigger. He fires you. He had every right to do so. Freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences. I agree here.

Then let's suppose that you work for a public company funded by taxpayer money (essentially a government creation) (so everyone and not just special minority) and that you say ""ninini"". Not directed towards anyone. Not with a hint of racial hatred. 

Do you see the difference between two scenarios?

In first, freedom of speech came with the freedom of association, namely, disassociation  - your boss hired you, and your boss fired you.
In the second, government is your boss, and government does not have the luxury of depriving you from your freedom by jailing you based on one word. No matter how bad. Do you know why? Because the state exists to command monopoly on the just use of force (Hobbes, the guy who wrote that one book about sea monsters, Harry Potter or some stuff). And a crime defined solely by one group being able to commit it reeks of legal inequality that goes contrary to the spirit of UN Human Rights conventions. It is not just to the notion of equal treatment under law for which I am one hundred percent for. But you aren't.

The very instance of hate speech is legal inequality at its best. Using one form of legal inequality to combat some vague and abstract notion of oppression. Now let me use one of contemporary African American intellectuals - "" *No matter how disastrously some policy has turned out, anyone who criticizes it can expect to hear : 'But what would you replace it with?' When you put out a fire, what do you replace it with?* "" 


&gt;Thus why should public body that is funded by the taxpayer - thus in a social contract with the taxpayer to obey the norms and values we uphold as a population ( which you may disagree with as an individual) be paying for someone to do this on their clock.

This quote is fundamentally devoid of any morals and justice. If social contract is founded on unjust principles, it will be unjust. I could take your quote and using my time machine to go back in 1939 and watch the Fuhrer agree with me. And the very instance of hate speech, as defined by you and the likes of you, is **unjust**.


&gt;We have already established the platform that speech can be abuse - I showed you the case study evidence and the science. We agree that abuse is oppression.

I would rather not play with the words and have you evoke all your ontological and epistemological powers. Abuse is bad. Overusing your freedom to abuse is bad. Your freedom should only be limited by the basic liberties of others (those three I mentioned earlier). Using your freedom to infringe on the freedom of others in order to abuse (abuse as direct attack to person's concrete wellbeing) is not only bad, but must be prohibited by the state at all costs. The way the state does this is by using legal methods. Namely, the monopoly on the just use of force. When the state stops doing that, it loses its value. Like you yourself said, we can go full Godwin then. When the state no longer ameliorates injustices, but instead codifies them, you have oppression. The real kind of oppression. The one you fight against.

true,Denswend,null,null,"&gt;Why is my oppression suddenly less important , than the person who no one forced utter hate speech, in a public space that I jointly own with a society that says - hate speech is something that has consequences?

Because you use the concept of hate speech, itself unjust and favouring your race (see above), as a weapon against everyone who disagrees with your worldview of what words when used by whom are deadly, to oppress those same people that make up your society. Activism isn't a tool that the weak use against the strong, it's a tool that strong use against the weak to preserve their victim status when they long since stopped being the victims themselves.

Not only that you censor free speech based on emotions and turn parts of it into hate speech, then you divorce this hate speech from the violent intent, and then to add the flavour you make it so that your own race is immune to it. 

If you truly were oppressed, we wouldn't be having this conversation. UK wouldn't explode with **one man, reciting an old nursery rhyme, not even saying the word nigger** if you were oppressed. Your ""oppression"" from being hurt by a mumbled word an imaginary victimization of yourself based on your race is infantile at best and [delusional at worst](http://imgur.com/LGSIpbN). This very delusion becomes dangerous when you use it as a justification to wage war on others. **One man, reciting an old nursery rhyme, not even saying the word nigger** is subject to a massive witch hunt that will stain his social reputation and knowing hate speech laws in UK, lead to criminal penalization. 

&gt;why a 54 year old man - who's not an old senile man which is hard to believe if you're 20- and a public personality should feel comfortable enough in his position that he can use it as a platform to hurt people.

**ONE MAN, RECITING AN OLD NURSERY RHYME, NOT EVEN SAYING THE WORD, INSTEAD MUMBLING IT, WITHOUT INSULTING ANYONE DIRECTLY, WITHOUT CALLING FOR RACIAL TENSIONS, WITHOUT ANY HIDDEN AGENDA** is not hurting people. You're delusional if you think that it is.  

&gt;At what point is it enough Rabi Hillel said ""If not you , then who. If not now, then when?"" This is a genuine question for you.

This question may be genuine somewhere somewhen, but not right now. Instead, it the question of ""You,now,"" and it isn't even a question. It's a statement. You seem to imply (once again, you evoke slippery slope by heavily implying it) that if ""ninini"" is said, that my own freedoms will be compromised. They won't. In fact, you and the likes of you are the very threat to liberty, coming under the guise of benevolent political correctness.

&gt;BTW - I've worked in 40 counties, five continents and various time zones. I've also had the pleasure of hundred of nationalities as colleagues and students. I've lived outside the UK as an expat, and in the UK as a citizen. It's not to add any authority to my argument, but just a gentle reminder on what you're dealing with.

First you start by writing pathetical rhetoric that makes you look like a high school student with all your rich fearmongering and guilt tripping.

Then you start by acting all offended when called upon, you appeal to the authority of UN and you do it falsely which I point out (equal and equal under law are not the same thing) to which you respond with more emotional guilt tripping. Then you find out that ""check your privilege"" won't work on someone who lived through a communist regime which left consequences even now. Cue Oppression Olympics.

And then you use basic philosophical concepts, explain them like you're some sort of modern day Kant who brought fire of progress to our bigoted minds. Then you apply them (unsuccessfuly) to your own ideas of what is hate speech, who says it and why it's just. It's not just. Then you cry about oppression which you faced by having **ONE MAN, RECITING AN OLD NURSERY RHYME, NOT EVEN SAYING THE WORD, INSTEAD MUMBLING IT, WITHOUT INSULTING ANYONE DIRECTLY, WITHOUT CALLING FOR RACIAL TENSIONS, WITHOUT ANY HIDDEN AGENDA** mumble ""ninini"" and support a modern day witchhunt by the very people who are supposed to stop them over ""ninini"" on the basis that it ""hurts"" a lot of people. I wonder if you could get off from your Ivory tower and face a real world and real people. 

And then there's this neat little piece, boasting about your successful career in order not to add authority to your argument, but heavily imply authority to your argument. Every single nation in the world can pass a law stating that usage of word ""nigger"" by whites is punishable by death. Every single contemporary intellectual can do all sorts of mental gymnastics to give it an air of credibility. It still won't be just.

The very fact that someone like you (if you are telling the truth), holds a significant status in the current society is something that sickens me to the core.

There has never been an accidental detonation of a nuclear weapon which is impressive as I believe about 150,000 have them have been made over the years. There was possibly a [near miss](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/20/usaf-atomic-bomb-north-carolina-1961) in 1961, but the complex trigger device on nuclear weapons is designed precisely and solely to prevent this sort of thing happening and it worked perfectly. Design has subsequently come along from that. 

**tl;dr:** Basically putting the nuclear arsenal on the clyde seemed like a no-brainer. I'm sure there is much regret about it now, as its an own-goal for the UK government against the SNP. Nuclear weapons are actually incredibly safe. Nuclear power on the other hand is [inherently risky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster).

true,IIAOPSW,uk,"""the states""... don't look at me like that","So I happen to know a bit about this topic and I see figures like this floating around all the time. While my personal bias is pro nuclear, my objective here is to spread facts that will hopefully make your opinion more informed. 

First, look at this picture:  
http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/images/np/spent-fuel-pool.jpg
  
It looks like an average sized swimming pool. That is a spent fuel pool. A pool of that size can typically store about 40 years worth of waste. My point here is that when people talk about all the ""waste"" generated by nuclear power plants, keep in mind that by volume the waste takes up little more than a car park. And by the way, you can swim in it:  

https://what-if.xkcd.com/29/  

Another thing to realise is that pools are not the final stop. When a fuel rod is first made, it is basically harmless. You can stand right next to it. In fact, here is a picture of me standing next to one:  

http://imgur.com/nenfmJz  

However when it comes out is a different story. If I tried to stand that close to the same fuel rod after its ~18 month fuel cycle they would have to bury me in a lead casket. What happens is that the Uranium (or plutonium) fission products are themselves radioactive. Extremely radioactive. When a nuclear power plant attempts to shut down by inserting the control rods, the fission stops in less than a second but the other radioisotopes are so radioactive that they can keep producing about 6% of the plants energy. This is called decay power. It is the reason you cannot just shut down and start up your plant on a whim. After about an hour decay power is around 2% operating output. After a few days it is low enough to take the fuel rods out but still very hot. That is where spent pools come in. After a few decades in the fuel pool, they are ready for dry storage. 

Dry storage units are typically concrete industrial monoliths. Here is a good example (human for scale):  
http://www.ihi.co.jp/nupd/nuclear%20technology/nuclear%20fuel%20cycle/concrete%20cask200.jpg  

So if you take anything away from this, let it be this: waste isn't a big deal because an entire century of it can easily sit in a car park without any risk. However the centuries after that are of some concern. This waste can remain deadly to people near it for on the order of 1000 years. How and where should we store it so that people of the future (possibly after civilization collapsing events) know not to touch it? The most common solution is to get the government to take all the waste from all the power plants, shove it into one foreboding location, and communicate as permanently and non-verbally as possible ""keep out."" The result can be creepy:  

http://www.damninteresting.com/this-place-is-not-a-place-of-honor/  

Next, I want to talk about breeder reactors. Remember that long paragraph on decay power? Well it turns out to be relevant because over the course of a fuel cycle radioactive daughters aren't the only thing produced. the ~18 month neutron bombardment can create other radioisotopes which are themselves fissionable. A breeder reactor is a reactor designed such that the resulting ""waste"" can be reused as fuel. Obviously this can't be done indefinitely. There is an ""end of life"" of a fuel rod. And at the end of a breeder reactor, you end up with a much more radioactive byproduct, but far far less of it. If memory serves breeder reactors produce about 10% the waste as conventional reactors. The main roadblock to breeders are political. Once more, if memory serves, France and India use breeders to a great extent whereas in the US they are illegal.  

The final thing I want to mention is about safety. These plants are operated with a high degree of redundancy. However the greatest risk (IMO) is what is called a full station blackout. That is when there is a blackout and the onsite backup generators fail (leaving you with no onsite electricity). This happened at Fukushima. Remember that decay power I keep going on about. Well you see, when you try to shut down you actually have to spend energy. The reason being that you need to keep the coolant circulating with pumps and for technical reasons the decay power isn't enough to run the turbines. If you try to shut down a plant without external power, you have about 2 hours before all the water coolant is evaporated out and the fuel itself starts to melt down. At that point you are in a rush to get any water at all flowing, including but not limited to hooking up someones car to the pump.  

However there is a type of reactor known as a ""pumpless reactor"" that uses the heat gradient to push the water without any external dependence. I like this design better because it has fewer parts (less to go wrong) and is immune to a total station blackout.

EDIT:

In my long post I never addressed the original comment. How silly of me. Yes it costs money to store the waste but nuclear is unique in that we actually retain all the waste. Something like a coal plant spews all its waste into the atmosphere which then costs not in terms of storage but in terms of global warming. And it is disingenuous to talk about the cost of storing waste without also mentioning the money created by 50+ years a typical reactor will operate. I've never heard of waste costing £70 billion so I would look for mismanagement. However the question of who should pay for that waste storage (government, operator, that neighbour you don't really like) is a political question which I don't want to touch.",0,1399216942,null,0,1399219565,1,ch99qn3,t3_24orgt,t1_ch99qn3,t1_ch9803m,null,1433645859,266,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,266

As for places of interest, if you are an ice hockey fan at all Toronto is the home of the Hockey Hall of Fame, which in addition to just being a HoF is also essentially a hockey museum. There's also the CN tower if you want a nice view of the city, but like all tourist traps of this sort it has an expensive elevator admission (aboot $30 CDN; which reminds me, while [Canada](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/92/Canadian_Frontier_Banknotes_faces.png) and [the USA](http://www.officialbhuldahcompany.com/USDnotes.jpg) share the name ""dollar"" they are different currencies). If it is a nice day, you are planning on the CN Tower, and have a bit of extra cash to burn for an interesting touristy thing there is the [EdgeWalk](http://www.edgewalkcntower.ca/) where they bring you outside near the top of the tower in a jumpsuit and a harness and you walk along an outdoor catwalk encircling the tower while looking out at and leaning over the city. Book that in advance though if it interests you. Aside from that there's not much I can think aboot, unless you want to go searching for Toronto's famed mayor, Rob Ford, in some crack houses.

I don't think it's really fair to base decisions like this on opinion polls.  While they do a great job in the last few days before an election, it's not really clear to me whether they are meaningful at all before that, particularly since they seem to move in pretty consistent ways (the ruling party generally does poorly in the polls a couple of years prior to a general election, then makes up lost ground during the election campaign).  A long way from an election, an opinion poll is asking people to predict how they would behave in a completely hypothetical situation (""an election tomorrow""), and humans are really very bad at doing that.

Also, the polls can and do systematically under- or oversample groups of people.

&gt; They have no real economic policy for growth, they're anti-nuclear powe, they don't seem to understand the major expenses and risks involved with many renewable energy sources

Replace nuclear with wind, and all of this is even more true of UKIP.  At the last election, they were proposing privatising just about everything, introducing a flat income tax, and various other extreme libertarian economic policies, but they seem to have completely disowned all that now and have no coherent views on the economy at all (beyond ""everything would we better if we weren't in the EU"").

""All agents are different but from my experience working at a lettings agent:
Viewings - many agencies won't go ahead without at least SOMEONE viewing it first as it can open up a tin of worms. Every applicant has different standards and expectations, and all Landlord's are different in willingness to make improvements. If you took the property and then were unhappy with it, some Landlord's are happy to fix things, others aren't, and you could be stuck with something you don't like - headache for every party involved. What we do is say find someone to view on your behalf - such as a friend or future colleague you feel you can trust - and through them you can sort issues in advance.
Guarantors - not necessarily. We use a referencing agency to make sure your employment is confirmed and do a credit check, so sometimes applicants won't need one at all if their affordability and employment security is good. We do, however, get the landlord to sign a reference waiver which states that the applicant can't provide UK proof of residency and that they are still happy to go ahead.
Really, the best thing to do is contact some agencies direct, good ones will be more than happy to explain their processes, particularly if they are ARLA registered. Good luck!""",0,1399218561,null,0,1399219421,0,ch9abul,t3_24ozvs,t1_ch9abul,t3_24ozvs,null,1433646138,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

The Ballymurphy victims didn't catch the media's attention anywhere near as much (how many books and films are there on the subect, compared to Bloody Sunday?), and the latest Bloody Sunday inquiry left a lot of government supporters complaining that it was a lot of time, money, and effort put into discrediting the British Army.

If Ivan wasn't with us, Azpi would still be a RB, he's better as a RB, but we have the problem of having three great CBs, I rate Ivan higher than Terry as a CB but Terry would never be dropped for Ivan, ever. Is Azpi better than Cole? Nope, but very rarely is a player removed from a position when they have fulfilled that position fully when a player becomes injured, in fact it's very common.

I'm surprised with our Bus tactics Jose hasn't gone for 3 dedicated CBs every game.

&gt;Pouring £50 bn into one line is a massive dereliction of duty with respect to the rest of the country, especially coming as it does on the back of other enormous investments centered around London  - Crossrail, Thameslink etc. 

£50bn (the actual predicted cost is slightly under) is the cost over the entire project. Annually, about £2bn of funds will be released. This is the equivalent of what we're paying for Crossrail at the moment, and the funding for HS2 comes in when the funding for Crossrail ends, meaning that there will be no annual additional spend for HS2.

Where was the campaign against Crossrail on the scale we've seen for HS2? Given that London's had Crossrail, the Jubilee line extension, and average public spending per head on transport in London is over £5,000 when the rest of the country it's under £1,000, why does the same annual cost suddenly become an issue when the rest of the country sees some transport investment?

&gt;Large areas of the country are without even a single mile of electrified track, and the government is already pulling back from commitments in other parts of the county, as in the [South Wales Valleys](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-26620650). 

This is actually quite analogous to the nuclear debate; you're ignoring the enormous capacity gap in the future. We're near capacity at the moment, and the supposed 'tweaks' suggested as alternatives such as duplex carriages, station lengthening, additional carriages are just patchworks and short term fixes. Bear in mind, the first stage of HS2 will be in use by 2025. If we *don't* build a new line, can you imagine the capacity issues we'd be facing on our victorian lines then? We've not built any new rail track north of London for 100 years, HS2 is *needed* for long term capacity.

true,cock_blockula,null,null,"Surely these political ideology and localism are intrinsically linked. I agree with your assessment of the disparity in attitudes to immigration. Obviously English people aren't somehow innately more racist than Scottish people and if you switched the situations the reactions may well be quite similar. That's the crux of the point really, people's political ideologies form as a result of the situations they're exposed to and the situations in Scotland and England (the dominant force of rUK) are increasingly different, combined with the FTTP Westminster system this, to me at least, is acting as a positive feedback type process causing Scotland to grow apart from rUK politically. To me the correcting mechanism for this would be major constitutional reform.

I don't think we can currently find a solution to the immigration issue or the other issue you mention with regards to London and SoE's interest in retaining looser financial regulations within the UK as it is now without fundamental reform to the way we govern ourselves. Personally as I think a more federal UK i.e greater devolution not just to Scotland, Wales, NI but areas of England too, would go some way to reducing the differences at Westminster since a lot of local issues would be solved at local levels. There is another solution to this, independence from the UK so that Scotland can make all of its decisions in the interests of its people rather than having an ever increasing list of policies that are not. The problem for me is that only one of these options is on the table, so I will vote yes, since the UK doesn't seem to think it is need of reform.

Emotional arguments

&gt;Yes. And you are using them. 

Not  really , what I said was that you use of lived experience invalidated another lived experience undermined your whole thread. Secondly, it was a reference to your deployment of Godwin. 

&gt;you can't define a political correctly

Typo.. I meant to say political concepts correctly - ie facsim v totalitarianism



My argument was about context, and that context is something you fail to either define properly or understand. Something you keep demonstrating every time you threaten a keyboard. 

And I didn't deploy Foucault, I mentioned him, and I mentioned him as one end of a sliding scale that led to Behavioural psychologists that have discussed, defined and argued over the concept of context. 

You haven't engaged with any of that. I told you clearly I'm not an logical positivist, and that logical positivism doesn't really work in this field of debate - either academically or intellectually. As a discipline found this out in 1977 and most of social science gets a little bit suspicious of anyone non-american trying to use it.  I'm not a post-modernist either - thus I haven't quoted Foucault. I mentioned him - in passing. 

So let's get all this guff that you've put up as a barrier out of the way. I mean if you have macro arguments you've cut and paste from somewhere that you use against post-modernists and gender theorists - go ahead. It'll be a good laugh. I love my post-modernists, they some really challenging things that everyone else has a hard time dealing with. Which is what puts everyone is such bad mood with them , Marxists get upset at being called out on determinism, logical postivist hate them because the take apart the supremacy of the dominant rational model et. Post modernists are an intellectual wrecking ball if your school of thought isn't up to snuff. 

Unfortunately for you - that means logical positivism lost quite early on in Social Science to them. Shame though, Bertie Russell says some  cute things. 

But I digress onto debates I haven't had since I started research and I was as bored with them now as I am with them then.

&gt;Your post (and your whole Lock and social contract 101 paragraph) is redundant in this discussion. 

This goes back to the above point - norms define a social contract. Norms are social construct with components to them. Those components both interact and define norms. 

THIS is is what proves you've got no idea what I'm talking about. Which makes a lot of sense because you seem to be stuck on a loop when it comes to your argument. You see, if you understood the role or normative values and social formation you'd also understand that I'm essentially not talking about political philosophy I'm talking about how moral codes and thus practice is formed. You want a reference for it you should look up Anthony Giddens and Structuration.

Locke's Social Contract is a normative process, it then goes through normative changes and negotiation for it to end up where-ever it ends up. You could say the same thing about Rousseu and Kant. 

Add a dash of major social or economic upheavals, cataclysmic events, revolution and  radical change in class - you have yourself a social context on the macro level. Stick an individual in the middle of all that you have context on a micro level. 

That is context and you have demonstrated zero understanding of this process. 

Now I'm heading out for a few.. but I'll be back to sort out the rest of your very confused, if rather heroic post.

Go see the CN tower, walk around Chinatown and Little Italy and the like and grab some food, maybe go to the Distillery District and see some weird crafts and have a beer on the patios, find some live music at night.

It's also worth remembering the government told nuclear companies to put forward their case, and none of them had anything of worth to say, hence the release of the 2009 low carbon economy transition plan by government.

Yes really. Do I need to copy/paste your whole ""inadequacies and failures, hurt loved ones,etc"" paragraph again.

&gt;Typo.. I meant to say political concepts correctly - ie facsim v totalitarianism


&gt;Never said that they were. The phrase "" It's a fallacy to think fascism only comes in black."" is the one you'd think I don't know the diference. It's just a phrase I heard from a friend and decided to keep.

The one who infers my ignorance of differences between fascism and totalitarianism is you. And I never used those two terms as if they were one and the same. 
Your objection to this seems like a pre-programmed response meant to shut down any credibility opposition might have.  


&gt;This is context

[Context](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_(language_use)

Christ, get off your philosophical high horse and read what I write first. Context in my idea - to whom it was said by who, with what intention and what notions accompanied it **is** context. You've proven yourself in not just being incapable of comprehending that basic fact, but in the act of reading and understanding read itself.  

You see, what you're doing now is simply repeating basic philosophical ideas with a hint of name dropping. I was using Foucault as a point from which to ridicule that notion. I didn't even know you **did** drop him at some point. You can load your words with a lot of social/economica/cultural/queer theory concepts you want. But they won't necessarily reflect the real state of affairs. My usage of context, bolded because you always skim through it, **is linguistical one - to whom it was said by who, with what intention and what notions accompanied it**.  

Your whole post right here is what I defined as your version of context - social/economical/cultural surroundings. Valid, yes, but ultimately irrelevant if you cannot prove that in this discussion - the word ""nigger"" is so bad it needs to be censored when used by any non-black groups. This is the crux of my argument and I'm tired of copy pasting it only for you to skim over it. You are educated in these matters yes, but your own race and victimization complex blinds you so that you paint yourself as victim no matter what.

To make matters even worse, you blow thing over proportion and instantly evoke ""First they came"" as if **one man mumbling something reminiscent of nigger** is the oppression as hard as thousand exploding suns. Then you act like it gives you the right to enforce oppression instead over him. And you do this all while retaining the vague notion that it's *you* who's the oppressed here. You're the oppressor here. You and all human rights group who ask for his termination. You're the worst kind of oppressor, the one who uses past misdoings to justify his current misdoings.

No amount of mental gymnastics is going to change that, vaguely defining concepts while appealing (falsely mind you) to authority  - whether legal (equal under law does not mean equal) or philosophical (your entire mental masturbation in this post).

The problem is that expanding our pumped storage means damming most of Wales, the Lake District and the Highlands. All the obvious hydro-electric projects have already been built. Usually gas power stations are built to feed the grid when the wind isn't blowing.

""Palaver"", originally meant ""talk"", ""conference"", ""discussion"".

It has acquired the meaning of ""dispute, quarrel, misunderstanding, or matter for negotiation"".

http://www.oed.com/search?searchType=dictionary&amp;q=palaver&amp;_searchBtn=Search

I have generally heard ""palaver"" used to mean a discussion over a misunderstanding or a disagreement.  It does not seem to necessarily have the same implication of heightened emotions as a ""scene"" (which almost by definition needs to happen in the public view of onlookers) or a ""fuss"".

Of course, exactly how these words are used probably varies across different parts of the English speaking world.

It is north of the downtown loop area but accessible by train, and we will probably do some Karaoke or something after the Q&amp;A.

Edit - On Saturday there will be shuttles leaving from the Atlantic to go down to the Fire Game. If you would like to ride down to the park with fellow like minded fans you can get a ticket here - http://www.chicago-fire.com/matchday/pubtopitch


Toyota Park where the game is at is south of the City in a town called Bridgeview.

There are hotels down there and we even have a room deal going on for a hotel down there. [Hotel Deal](http://hamptoninn.hilton.com/en/hp/groups/personalized/C/CHIMWHX-TOT-20140722/index.jhtml) One of the Chicago Spurs members is the manager at the hotel and they will be running a shuttle to the game from the hotel.  

But one of the down sides to staying out by Midway is you are going to be further away from The Atlantic / a lot of the culture that is available down town. It is connected by a train line to downtown but it will just take longer to get places. 

Thursday night we actually have something in the works for an event but we need to sort out the details but I can promise it will be fun, there will be a chance to meet supporters from everywhere and to party. Maybe we will go bowling or something. 

Chicago is a great place and there are a going to be so many things to do in Chicago and we look forward to hosting folks as they come into town.

A party is there to represent the views of the public, many of the public think animal testing is bad or should be limited - this is the party that represents that view

It wouldn't happen anyway, remember if the greens did get in it would never be as a majority anyway, it would need together with other parties and their ideas on animal testing.

Nuclear is ridiculously expensive, I still support it though. We still haven't decided a place to actually store our waste though, just temporary sites.........this should be finalised before we build anymore. In that way, the greens could influence a more restricted 'get this safety stuff sorted' role - they know they won't get a 'lets ban nuclear' through into law

GM is awkward - it's their view fine, but it's also their kind of unofficial view to reduce the population, a reduced population doesn't need all the food GM provides, so it makes sense from their own viewpoint

The tax stuff? So.....same as every party except the Conservatives. None of them understand government spending, they all seem to think the pot is bigger than it really is.

Although people like ourselves (and as I just said), forget that the greens aren't designed to get into power as a major 'We have the greens in this time' party, they are there to throw other viewpoints into the mix, same as the Lib dems so we don't end up with a Labour VS Conservative in EVERYTHING. It's a system that works quite well, as even if they only get 5MP's, the views would be considered. If every party went away other than the main two we'd have the american system....which is blooming awful.  Even if the views are trash, it gets people talking. 

Some issues the greens have an (opinion) right idea, or want to say what others aren't, such as renationalising power and railways etc. Notice how labour are now going on about railways after the Bring Back British Rail and the Green Parties campaigns?  Their ideas do get into the mainstream just by talking about them.

I think if you give them some power we'll go through the hippy stuff for a while, and then get down to business, as is the case in Brighton, they have their ideals but need to be given a chance to become professional - same as UKIP is weeding out all the crazy members at the moment ",0,1399222582,null,0,false,0,ch9bvru,t3_24olzy,t1_ch9bvru,t1_ch99l2d,null,1433646936,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

A quick search finds there are 4.9 Million tonnes of waste to dispose of. That is 4,900,000,000 Kg. Lets look at the rocket equation.   
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation

Since I am lazy, I will steal their example calculation of a 2 stage orbiter. According to their calculation, ~16% of the rocket is available for the rocket/payload itself. The other 85% is fuel. Assume that 6% of the vehicle is our rocket, and that 10% is the spent fuel we want to get rid of. By this rough estimate, it would take 44,100,000,000 Kg of rocket fuel just to put the waste into orbit. 

I won't do the maths now because this has already sucked up too much time, but when you compare the energy needed to get all that mass to the sun to the amount of energy that the spent nuclear fuel produced in its lifetime, you probably end up loosing energy. Not to mention all that fuel burned in the air would completely negate the positive benefits of nuclear power with respect to pollution. So no, the sun is a terrible answer.

I never stated Cole should play instead of Azpi, I've said for months Azpi and Cole should play on the same team with Terry and Ivan switching between games.

&gt;We need a striker - Mourinho has said all season that it would be where we fall down this season, and it was.

Yeah, it's called passing the blame to the Striker, well if he played Ba earlier on in the Season he wouldn't of had this problem.

He wasn't bad but he wasn't great I agree, he didn't have a connecting player with the defensive Norwich, which is why having an playmaker is crucial, which we don't have.

And Demba Ba isn't good enough to lead the line at Chelsea. He just isn't. Look at our rivals' main men - Suarez, Aguero/Negredo... Ba is nowhere near that level, never has been, never will. It's no secret Mourinho wanted Rooney in the summer, and we missed out. A player of his quality would arguably have made the difference. 

As it stands, we were within touching distances of what would have been a season that exceeded all expectations.

You're probably just hoping that we lose 10 games in a row and Mourinho gets sacked, though. Some of us have different priorities.

I'm not sure what the logic is in Terry having to sit out every other game when he has been absolutely excellent all season. Ivanovic isn't good enough to justify that.

I personally thought, and I know many others did too at the time, that once he bought Matic we were going to perhaps go back to being more attacking and free up defensive responsibilities from Mata and Hazard. He ended up selling of one them (I know Mata wanted to leave but you don't just let them go if you have a plan for them) and we were back to square one. 

So no, the midfield hasn't been good enough. Willian has been disappointing from an attacking perspective, Schurrle didn't really play until half way through the season but looks like he knows where the goal is which is more than I can say for the majority of the squad, KDB wasn't here long enough to make any sort of impact and it's the same for Salah as well. 

I also think the midfielders are as much to blame as the strikers when it comes to not finishing, Oscar has missed a lot of chances this season, Willian's shots are pretty poor for an attacking player, they are either right at the keeper or they are spooned out of play, etc. Basically everyone needs to accept responsibility, improve and do better next season. I'm sure Jose already has plans in his mind about where to improve and we will hopefully go back to playing the attacking football we did at the start of this season.

No, he didn't die when he was on Trenzalore, but when he originally visited the planet with Clara in ""The Name of the Doctor,"" he could have been there in the future (as in way after his time protecting the town of Christmas). Remember, timey-wimey. 

He could have wanted the rift destroyed, sure, but his main mission was to protect the people of Christmas. And maybe he could have done so by getting rid of the rift, but remember, if he doesn't have to kill/harm people, he's not going to. So that's why he didn't destroy the rift (cause it could have harmed his people somehow). Plus, it was his only connection to the Time Lords/Gallifreyians, he probably wasn't keen on parting with his only connection to his people.

actually he never apologised for using the word, he apologized for it sounding like he did. he has to apologize to keep his job, that's hardly what I'd call an admission of guilt, regardless of whether we agree on whether it is wrong.

furthermore admitting to say a speeding offence is an admission of guilt but plenty of people would see nothing wrong in speeding. which brings us back to the point I'm making, it's not morally wrong for people to disagree with your opinion.

have to say it looked to me like a freudian slip more than anything so sinister

&gt;It's the same as a girl who has been raped saying so, in order to show that rape does still happen, and that therefore talking about it frivolously shouldn't be considered acceptable by a society that seeks solidarity with its victims.

that's the fundamental difference of opinion you have with the ""apologists"" from our point of view just because something serious happens doesnt mean we should all pounce on things that are similar but far more mild, or jokes about such subjects as unacceptable. at the end of the day I think it's just a word and nothing more harmful than that.

&gt;Stating that I'm black is to communicate that my unease at the situation comes from firsthand experience of said discrimination rather than theoretical musings.

implying that black people are the only race to be discriminated against and have it worse than any other, as well as implying that having been discriminated against gives you moral authority to decide what other people should be allowed to think. stating you're black tells us nothing at all besides the colour of your skin.

&gt;Judging a message by it's presentation rather than it's content is the wrong way of going about things. 

again differing opinion, presentation is key to this issue, it's the difference between a n unintentional slip of the tongue and the hate speech this is being portrayed as, and in terms of starting sentences with ""as a"" it implies a connection that doesn't exist between whatever demographic you are about to claim and

And here we see the encapsulation of so much of what is wrong with society today. The BBC is issuing this ultimatum to Clarkson based on 300 complaints from people who likely didn't even see the clip in question. 300. How many thousands and thousands of people watch the show world wide and did not complain? That doesn't matter.

These vocal minorities have broadcasting corporations running scared. 
""Sir, we've had a complaint about something on the show being offensive and insensitive."" 
""Shit. How many complaints?""
""Four.""
""Fuck! Pull the show!""

As someone who actually teaches US Constitutional law, I have to say that in countless readings, I have never found the article in that document that guarantees us the right to never be offended. Yet, that's the world we live in. People feel that if they see or hear something that they personally find offensive, then something must be done to stop this, right now! 

Joan Rivers was just fired from Norwegian Cruise Lines for a joke she made on the Today show about the women in Cleveland who had been kidnapped and kept for years. She's a comedian. It was a joke. Maybe it wasn't a good one, but calm down. 

The problem is that the vast majority of us are rational people (for the most part), and we use a simple tactic: if I see something that I don't like, or offends some sensibility of mine, I turn the channel. It really is that simple. Just because something offends me, I don't think that no one else should ever have the right to see or hear that thing. Why am I so important that my likes and dislikes should govern media for everyone. So that means that often the only people the companies hear from are the minority of people who are offended and feel the need to take action to remove the offensive element.

TL/DR: People should just grow up and turn the channel if they don't like something. ",0,1399224423,null,0,false,0,ch9cnp0,t3_24nh1t,t1_ch9cnp0,t3_24nh1t,null,1433647301,6,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,6

Nope, I hate that I've been right for the whole Season, I'd rather be wrong with a Title winning team than be right with a Team that should have won the Title.

&gt;And Demba Ba isn't good enough to lead the line at Chelsea. He just isn't. Look at our rivals' main men - Suarez, Aguero/Negredo... Ba is nowhere near that level, never has been, never will. It's no secret Mourinho wanted Rooney in the summer, and we missed out. A player of his quality would arguably have made the difference.

He's the best WE have, yet Mourinho has used Torres and Eto, that's what I was stating, I'm not going to compare Ba with the best Striker currently in the World.

&gt;As it stands, we were within touching distances of what would have been a season that exceeded all expectations. A few ingredients away , and you can just bet Mourinho will spend all summer thinking about the problem against the lesser teams. We stand in a strong position, and I'm excited for what is to come. You're probably just hoping that we lose 10 games in a row and Mourinho gets sacked, though. Some of us have different priorities.

I do hope that Mourinho will eventually get the sack, I've supported Chelsea for a long time and under Jose this Season we've been terrible with the players we have, you cannot compare us with the team we had under RDM or Benitez for two reasons.

 - Different players/primes
 - Different League

Before this Season Tottenham and Man United had been arsehole teams to play, luckily for us this Season they have been utter crap and not only us, but Liverpool and Man City have taken full advantage of it. We should have won the Title weeks ago, and believe me we would have with any of our last 4 Managers.

&gt;I'm not sure what the logic is in Terry having to sit out every other game when he has been absolutely excellent all season. Ivanovic isn't good enough to justify that. He wouldn't add anything that we don't already have - our defence, by and large, has been excellent this season. It's our attack that needs adjustment. Fiddling with the centre backs doesn't change that.

He has been excellent this Season, actually better than anyone expected, but it has helped with Cahill being in the form of his life. Ivan for me is still better than Terry as a CB, I think you've forgotten how deadly he has been for us for the last few Seasons.

Imagine, you are weighed down with a bag full of leaflets, have spent the last 4 hours knocking on doors, cheerfully talking to people, its probably started drizzling and you open another gate (with 'BEWARE OF THE DOG') on it. Wait a moment to see if a large mutt will bound around the corner and try to eat/slobber you to death.  Once happy you approach the door and there is no sound, silence.

You touch the letter box and suddenly, you can hear.. No, you can feel a large hound starting to move from the top floor. You have a leaflet in hand and the letter box flap up (its probably one of those ones with flaps on both sides and solid bristle in the middle, so to get anything through it you almost have to stick your hand in..) the dog is now clearly at the top of the stairs, launching itself downward.

You have the leaflet (and at least one finger..) in, at this point you aren't sure if its a dog running at the door or a rhino.. you extract your hand, let the letterbox lid fall and there is a huge 'thump' as the dog hits the door and barks like a mad thing..  

You just know that the leaflet you carried all day, lovingly delivered and hoped would influence someone (in a good way..) is being torn into tiny little pieces, so you turn, walk away a little dejected when..

The door opens, the owner looks out sees you and says something like 'Pizza Leaflets? don't need any more' - whilst behind him, the tiniest little dog is standing, vibrating with pent up rage.

true,KaiserMacCleg,wales-denbighshire,Powys Fadog,"&gt; Where was the campaign against Crossrail on the scale we've seen for HS2? Given that London's had Crossrail, the Jubilee line extension, and average public spending per head on transport in London is over £5,000 when the rest of the country it's under £1,000, why does the same annual cost suddenly become an issue when the rest of the country sees some transport investment?

It was an issue when it was being spent on Crossrail as well. Flagship projects like these have been precluding investment in the wider rail network for decades. 

&gt; This is actually quite analogous to the nuclear debate; you're ignoring the enormous capacity gap in the future. 

I'm not ignoring it at all. There are far better ways to increase capacity on our railway network that will reach a wider area of the country at a fraction of the cost, as described in [this report](http://b.3cdn.net/nefoundation/6deec6da8eb212246d_jsm6iqoq5.pdf). Capacity will soon become a problem country wide. The idea that one new line could come close to solving our problems in that area is fanciful at best.

And capacity is only part of the problem. You are right to call our network Victorian - there are parts of the country that have not seen any large investments in their railways since the start of the last century. Electrification should also be a priority. Not only would that go a long way to modernising our ageing infrastructure, it would also provide a foundation for cities and regions to build upon when improving their own transport networks. The [Cardiff metro](http://www.mgbarryconsulting.com/iwa_metroreport.pdf) is a prime example - the idea has been floating around for a while now, but it will remain nothing but blue sky thinking in the absence of a fully electrified rail network.

My ideal summer would be that the Philip Anschutz rumour is true and he purchases the club from Lerner. He has the necessary funds and knowledge to potentially take us to the top. I would also be happy with Davis and Simpson, which was the big rumour a couple of weeks ago.

Re: takeover rumours. I'm not sure how many of you are on other Villa fan sites, but in my opinion there are just too many potentially reliable sources claiming that something major is happening for it not to be true.


The head of what is arguably the most prominent Villa fan site (at least in the media), Fear from Vital Villa, was the most staunch opponent of these rumours denying that anything was happening and that we would all end up disappointed.

Of course they do.

Nobody does.  It's just a simple way of denoting something.  It's why they all wear rosettes.

I'm no fan of Westminster politics and never have been, I see little drive to change things either.  I feel my country is better served by having all matters of government within its borders, devolution has been on the whole a success so see no reason why full independence wouldn't be either.

The promise of a written constitution and a system of proportional representation for our central government is appealing and I see no reason why we can't be the same as any other independent nation with similar population and resources.

It matters little to me who is in government in Westminster and the rise of rather right wing ideas down south is somewhat concerning.  Such a shift may happen here too, I'd hardly be happy with that but at the very least I could feel that it's my country responsible.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Our style consists of defending great then once we recover the ball passing to Matic, who passes to Willian, who sprints up the field with a nice dribble then checks back and passes to Ramires who doesnt know how to pass forward who then just passes to a.) the other center mid or b.) Ivanovic. Then either 1 of 2 thing happen, we just pass the ball around aimlessly for about a minute or 2 until someone tries a pot shot and we lose the ball or Ivanovic tries to cross it and we lose the ball. You would be surprised how many times I have seen this exact play happen during our matches. The only time something actually happens seems to be when the team is aimlessly passing the ball around and it falls into Hazards feet and he makes something magical happen, whether a pass, shot, or dribble he is really the only catalyst in our team.

true,TheMysteriousShadow,lfc68,,"I have a couple of thoughts on it:

- Both us and City won't take maximum points from our last games. It's impossible to predict who will drop points where, but I'm certain the title won't be decided on goal difference. 

- Despite what Pellegrini is saying, there's no doubt that the City players are believing they've won the title already. After all, they've beaten Everton away, and that was their last *real* test. I think such confidence will make them complacent and could lead to a possible downfall in one of their matches. 

- My only concern is that both Villa and WH don't really have anything to play for; they're both safe and they don't need to really try their hardest to win or draw because it means nothing to them. That being said, because they're influencing the title on such a major scale, it might give them the push they need to actually play well. 

- Nothing chokes teams like pressure. We've played fantastic all season because there has been almost no pressure; we're the underdogs, the dark horses, the team punching above their weight because no one thought we'd have a chance. There's still no pressure on us because City have spent millions upon millions constructing a world-class side that *should* be winning titles every single year, and this should be their title if we're talking about a relation between prices and performances. I can see them crumbling under the pressure because they believe that they should win this.

- One final point: City and mid-week games don't tend to get along well. They played abysmally against Sunderland and didn't even deserve the draw (how important that point might be now!). It might be something to do with the over-reliance on certain players that might be tired or not as fit as they could be, but they do look like they might drop points mid-week more than on weekends. With Villa being their game in hand, too, if we win tomorrow night it puts some serious pressure on them because they know they *must* win.

true,n33mers,US,usa,"Torres does not act as a true striker anymore. He continues to fade to the wings delaying any direct or ""ruthless"" passes into the box. When he does manage to stay in his god assigned role, he fails to hold up the ball. When he does rarely successfully hold up the ball, he's not looking to commit to any link up play but rather turns and runs at the back 4. While I commend taking on defenders, this is not the Chelsea Torres strength. 

Eto'o is still playing at staying on the hip of the CB and trying to run off of him. When you watch the game, I'm positive if you know anything about his old play, you can tell that he has lost quite a few steps but still attempts to rely on his speed. When this fails he either makes runs towards the corner flag or drops entirely too deep. He also fades in and out of games due to this. If he was the Eto'o of old, I believe he would strive in our attempted system. &lt; pretty obvious, he was amazing 

Demba, I'd would be the best striker for our system if he had a bit more pace and technical ability &lt; doesn't hurt anyone to have more haha. He stands strong, rarely fades to the wings, and has the physical ability to hold up the ball. He's just lacking in a few key areas. 

The blame falls on the strikers for lack of production this year. I would also argue however, that Mou's system has done nothing but handcuffed our potential offensive productivity this year by requiring all 5 midfielders to track back at the sign of any pressure. I could go on a rant about how if we maintained Mata this could have not been an issue.. This and the lack of a true Lone Striker have compounded to leave us where we are now.

true,OldTomMorris,null,null,"&gt;Some perceived disparities are probably more to do with regional differences.

Well, yes. That goes against what you say when you state that you ""disagree with the idea that the UK and Scottish political ideology has moved apart."" These regional differences count. And they are widening. 

England has 85% of the population of the UK and the South East the majority of the former. As you say, a huge chunk of trade comes from the services sector (which in itself is a dangerous fact but not strictly relevant) but most of the investment is made in England. So whereas the UK GDP goes up and all is rosy, people in Scotland don't feel it nowhere near as much (exception of Edinburgh perhaps but even then, nothing close to London). 

This disparity in population and investment has shaped Scotland hugely and it has understood its place in the UK - it simply isn't as important. Its people don't feel represented (also a Scottish born PM is not representation - it's just a Scottish born PM) and in fact, they are not. 

They are against a huge number of measures that are imposed on them regardless - the Poll Tax, the Iraq War, the Nuclear Deterrent, the Bedroom Tax (which can not be abolished, only mitigated at the SG expense), the stance on immigration and so on. I mentioned these issues and not others because these specifically can not be reversed in law - and yet the majority of Scots oppose them outright!

This is not fair and it is certainly not feasible in the long term. The fact that Scots are a minority in the Union should not mean they can't have a say in the way their society is run. This is largely why the Scottish Parliament was set up. Not only, but a large proportion of Scots feel that their political ideologies are so different from the ones in England that they feel this SP is not enough! They want more - independence or, in some cases, devo-max. 

You can not understate this fact and I feel it personally blows your argument clean out the water. If the ideologies and societies of the countries were very close this discussion wouldn't be happening in the first place.

&gt;On the perception of independence being a slight against the English, I think ultimately it is.

Well, you're wrong then. Not one single Yes voter I know of has ever mentioned the English as a reason for their choice (many in fact *are* English). A very slight minority of No voters point their finger but as an argument, it never stands. They are immediately shunned by the majority of people who are actually taking this debate seriously and for whom such an accusation is quite offensive. 

If you think Yes voters are ""holier than thou"" then you are severely misguided. The right to self-determination and the ending of decades of disenfranchisement are at the core of the Yes/Devo Max stance. You can take it as a slight, but the fact is this ""relationshiop"" has never been mutual. In recent years, it has been so that a lot of Scots find it a detrimental one to their lives.

It's not a matter of hate, passion or pride in most cases - it's a matter of governance. If you are not happy with your current situation, you should sacrifice your happines because the ""UK's official position is it doesn't want this""? No, you do what you can to shape the future of you and yours.",0,1399230064,null,0,1399231909,0,ch9f2nx,t3_24os9a,t1_ch9f2nx,t1_ch997r3,null,1433648443,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

The [EMP (Experience Music Project) &amp; Science Fiction Museum](http://www.empmuseum.org/). Not real close to Century Link Field, but it's worth the trip if you're in to music and sci fi. 

Pike's Place Market. A large local market featuring amazing food to try. My recommendation is taking [Savor Seattle's](http://www.savorseattletours.com/) Pike Place tour - if you're a foodie it really is the best way to experience the market. 

Love burgers? You have to go to the [Lunchbox Laboratory](http://lunchboxlaboratory.com/). Words can't even describe how amazing they are.

Love fried chicken? [Ma'Ono](http://maono.springhillnorthwest.com/). 

Love beers? The [Yardhouse](https://www.yardhouse.com/WA/seattle-restaurant/) has over 100 different beers on tap. 

best sandwich in town - [Paseo's Cuban Sandwich](http://www.paseoseattle.com/). Feature in magazine and food TV programs, it's amazing (but go early because they will sell out!)

If you're in town on the 21st, there's no more American experience than heading to a baseball game. The Seattle Mariners will be playing the New York Mets at Safeco field (right next to century link). Worth experiencing if you've never been.

I'll let someone else comment on nightlife, but feel free to ask if you have more questions!

true,stop___grammar_time,silver,Silver,"&gt;So now people are doing all these ""Hurt wasn't really the Doctor"" gymnastic which is complete nonsense.

No one's saying Hurt's incarnation wasn't really the Doctor. That is, no one's saying he wasn't the same Time Lord known as ""the Doctor"".

 In Day of the Doctor, the Doctor made a point of explaining that in choosing to take the name ""Doctor"", he imposed a set of rules of conduct on himself that no incarnation of his who chose to take that name could break. In Night of the Doctor, following those rules gets the eighth Doctor killed. 

After being temporarily resurrected by the Sisters of Karn, he comes to the conclusion that his next regeneration must abandon those rules, and therefore must abandon the name ""Doctor"". The Sisterhood has the ability to engineer how a regeneration turns out; seeing his inability to do anything about the Time War as long as he abides by the constraints of going by ""Doctor"", he instructs them to make him ""a warrior"" - someone who would reject the name and the rules that come with it. 

That's who Hurt's incarnation was: The ninth incarnation of the Time Lord usually called ""The Doctor"" that did not himself go by that name or abide by the self-prescribed standards that go with taking that name. Eccleston's Doctor *was* the ninth *Doctor*. He was the tenth incarnation of that particular Time Lord, but only the ninth incarnation to take up the name and obligations of ""Doctor"". That's why Hurt wasn't the Doctor - he didn't call himself the Doctor or abide by the rules of being ""The Doctor"". 

Externally in real life yes, you could consider him one and bump Eccleston onwards up one number, but in universe the numbering stays the same. That's why the majority of fans use that numbering, because it's the numbering in universe.

We need more options for people who are not fulfilled by getting wrecked every weekend and shopping in overpriced city centre shops.

It is. But even if it wasn't the case it is enough for further investigation and questioning. i.e. Arresting someone.

I said all this before.

&gt;&gt;The ""evidence"" from the Boston College tapes cannot be used in court, it's mere hearsay from Brendan Hughes and Dolours Price.
If journalists record people admitting to crimes and implicating others then it's completely accepted that they can be arrested, the same goes for academia. The relevant statements are that confidentiality is “guaranteed to the extent American law allows”
From http://definitions.uslegal.com/a/admissibility-of-oral-and-written-confessions/[1]
An admissible confession may be oral or written, or partly oral and partly written. The fact that a statement is not reduced to writing does not render it inadmissible. An oral confession of a defendant is admissible at trial even though the defendant made a different, written confession, since a written confession does not cancel out a prior oral confession. A written confession need not constitute a literal transcription of what the defendant said, the substance of what s/he said is sufficient.
Also the Treaty between the US and UK on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. Makes these tapes applicable and that is why the subpoenas were issued for their legal acquisition. So err, what?
http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f227000/227062.htm[2]
Also under English law
Section 116 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 provides that where a witness is unavailable, hearsay is admissible where a) the relevant person is dead; b) the relevant person is unfit to be a witness because of his bodily or mental condition; c) the relevant person is outside the UK and it is not reasonably practicable to secure his attendance; d) the relevant person cannot be found; e) through fear, the relevant person does not give oral evidence in the proceedings and the court gives leave for the statement to be given in evidence.
An example of hearsay is, to prove Tom was in town, the barrister asks a witness, ""What did Susan tell you about Tom being in town?"" Since the witness's answer will rely on an out-of-court statement Susan made, and Susan is not available for cross-examination, and it is to prove the truth that Tom was in town, it is hearsay.
I don't see how that is at all similar to ""Gerry Adams told me to kill XYZ""
EDIT P.S. Arresting someone means
""An arrest is the act of depriving a person of his or her liberty usually in relation to the purported investigation or prevention of crime and presenting (the arrestee) to a procedure as part of the criminal justice system.""
So it's more than enough for an arrest and further investigations

true,_lolwhat_,IM,isle of man,"It is both.

I know Mourinho said that he was forced to revert back to a more defensive side because Chelsea was giving up goals. This is only half true. 

From the very beginning of the season, Chelsea struggled to score goals. Even matches against Norwich and Cardiff, looks great on the stat sheet, but they were absolutely shit. 

Now, for the midfielders.

Hazard - I believe he was asked to do too much, at the wrong position. I understand that Hazard is your best player, but to put your attack mostly based on a winger is just wrong. It is just too easy to close down a winger. I wish he was given minutes centrally because Oscar has struggled. 

Oscar - I have been very disappointed with Oscar. He has not really improved much from last season. I keep reading that he is young, so much potential, he is only 22! This is not an excuse. People are too drawn into potential, but they forget that in reality, most of these guys never reach it.

Willian - I love Willians defensive efforts. He is the perfect 'Mourinho player'. But, he just doesn't have the creativity. He just doesn't add much. Even defensively, if you put Schurrle in, you probably won't notice much difference. At £ 31m, you would expect more.

Schurrle - He should have been given more minutes. He and Hazard were Chelseas best attacking midfielders/fowards of the season. He is dangerous with the ball, even more dangerous when counter attacking. 

Chelsea, well, Mourinho, seemed to never learned from previous results at all. We all know he is stubborn, but at some point, you have to change something. 

He is so insistent on putting Willian centrally. Never gave Hazard much of a chance in the middle. I would have loved to see what Hazard and Schurrle could do together.

Overall, Chelseas attacking struggle is because of tactics and Mourinho. Were the midfielders at peak? No, but they are more than enough. Add to the fact that Chelsea had a lot of options. Unfortunately, not much was tried at all.  ",0,1399232165,null,0,false,0,ch9fzqv,t3_24pc7x,t1_ch9fzqv,t3_24pc7x,null,1433648877,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

I agree there is many reasons. But immigration doesn't help and the EU is certainly a prime candidate for the blame. We spend £55M per day just to be a member of it. That's including a few rebates we get back. And not including all the money we pay on green initiatives etc. That could be put into the NHS, education, housing and transport instead which would ease the problem. It could help prevent the cuts (which I would assume you would blame for the problems with them) and allow for these things to be improved. Instead it's wasted on bureaucrats who override our sovereignty. 

&gt; Not the best example to make. I would fully support 21 million Romanians moving to other countries in the EU if it meant they weren't killed in a genocide.

I agree it's perhaps a poorly thought example but my point was that if this happened tomorrow, we have no way to prevent all 21 million people moving here. While I am absolutely **not** against people moving to flee genocide or war etc. I *am* against a mass, uncontrolled influx of immigration. If we had protected borders then we could decide to allow asylum seekers in but then reduce the amount of other immigration to ensure that it is balanced. What my point was is that nobody knows how much immigration we're going to get in the next 10, 20, 30 years. There's already problems with housing, school places and the such, allowing a completely unknown amount of immigration will not help that. If we can control it, then we can plan ahead for the future far more effectively. We can then look at how much immigration we want and can sustain, and help to plan ahead to ensure there's enough school places, transport, money for the NHS, and housing which will prevent problems in the future like we have at the moment.

true,ruven95,mcgann,McGann,"There is a new show and an old one, but the new show isn't a remake/ reboot, but furthers the story of the original. The BBC took the show off the air in the late 80s due bad ratings and tried to revive it with an American co-produced movie (which failed, sadly). The original show had stories lasting for about three to seven episodes (although there is one with just one episode and one with ten, but mostly three to seven) which were about twenty minutes each while the new show has story lasting two episodes at most, with each episode being nearly an hour long. The Doctor changes dies and renegenerates (-&gt; is played by a different actor) about every three seasons. Seven Doctors were in the original show, one in the tv-movie and (as of yet) three in the new show. I personally started my journey into Doctor Who with the beginning of the show and the Ninth Doctor. The first season has low production quality, because the BBC hadn't much hope for the show, but most of the writing is fairly good. They had more money for the next seasons. Other good points to jump on are the very first episode 'An Unearthly Child' (although the rest of the story isn't as great as the first episode), the first Third Doctor Story 'A Spearhead from Space', because it starts a more arc-based era of Doctor Who and the first episode with the Eleventh Doctor 'Eleventh Hour', which was the start of the Cracks-in-time-arc. My personal suggestion would be to start from the first episode of the new show 'Rose', watch through the new show completly and then cherry pick episodes of the classics. You can always ask me for suggestions. Many episodes of the new show call back to the classics, even run tandem with them at times. So it is likely that you ask ""I liked the episode XY of the new show a lot, which classic should I watch?"" and there would be something related in the old show.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"&gt; We spend £55M per day just to be a member of it

£55m per day is pretty insignificant in terms of government spending, and worth it for the trade and business links that the EU provides. 

&gt; That could be put into the NHS, education, housing and transport instead which would ease the problem.

For the 2013/14 year, the NHS alone had a budget of £260 million a day. Combined with the cost of all the other public services, £55m a drop in the water, and it wouldn't have a large effect on either increasing the budgets for public services or decreasing the depth of cuts. The potential loss of trade also has to be taken into account.

&gt; I agree it's perhaps a poorly thought example but my point was that if this happened tomorrow, we have no way to prevent all 21 million people moving here.

The thing is, lots of things *could* happen. 21 million Romanians *could* decide to move to the UK. The USA *could* decide to invade British territories in the Caribbean. A meteor *could* crash into London and destroy it. Just because something could happen, doesn't mean it will happen.

&gt; There's already problems with housing, school places and the such, allowing a completely unknown amount of immigration will not help that

Immigration might not help that, but there are plenty of other factors that don't either, factors that parties like UKIP ignore in order to blame everything on the EU. By blaming everything on immigration and not dealing with the intrinsic problems behind issues such as lack of affordable housing and school places, you are only at best pushing back a problem, not dealing with it.

My query would be does Rodgers have the same ability to develop defenders as he does midfield players.  Surely he can improve their ability on the ball but does he have the positional sense required to create a defensive unit that has chemistry and steel. 

I think maybe, just maybe, we need a defensive specialist on our staff.  Someone in the same ilk of Steve Clarke.  I could be wrong though.  It could just be a personel problem.  

We clearly have one of the best RCB's in the league in Skrtel.  Agger and Sakho have been decent and Kolo gives me no need to be upset.  I think the problem with our defense starts with our fulbacks.  Flanagan has been amazing this year, and Johnson has had ups and downs due to injury so its harsh to criticize either of them.  But if you look at the ways teams attack us, they're usually trying to take advantage of our fulbacks.  And I think they are right for doing so.

true,The_British_One,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt; £55m per day is pretty insignificant in terms of government spending, and worth it for the trade and business links that the EU provides. 
For the 2013/14 year, the NHS alone had a budget of £260 million a day. Combined with the cost of all the other public services, £55m a drop in the water, and it wouldn't have a large effect on either increasing the budgets for public services or decreasing the depth of cuts. The potential loss of trade also has to be taken into account.

As an economist I'm going to have to take you up on this one. We will lose absolutely no trade by leaving the EU. Even if for some ridiculous reason (which I cannot comprehend because it is absolutely nonsensical) the EU decide to put tariffs against our goods, we can very easily go and negotiate trade deals with other nations which the EU stop us from doing. That will bring new revenue streams in. But there is no reason for them to put tariffs up anyway. They need our trade just as much as we need theirs. We're the single biggest consumer of European goods outside the single-currency. We may be net importers but that only means that if they put tariffs up against us, we'll put tariffs up against them and that will hit them more than us. So they won't do it. We'll have a free-trade agreement like the Swiss or Norwegians do. 

Equally the £55M is *only membership fees*. It does not include a huge amount of bureaucratic red tape and duties and such that our companies have to comply with which costs us several billion a year in tax revenues because they have lower profits, employ less people and so spending as a whole is lower than it could be. Our penalties for missing green energy/pollution targets for being in the EU are also in the millions per day. It all adds up.

£55M a day isn't much...it's still £20 billion *per year*. That could add 20% to the NHS budget. It's a quarter of the education budget. It's the same as the transport budget. It's a lot more than you're making it out to be and you can do a hell of a lot with it. Not to mention the boost in government revenue from not having to pay for ridiculous compliances to EU directives and the like.

&gt; The thing is, lots of things could happen. 21 million Romanians could decide to move to the UK. The USA could decide to invade British territories in the Caribbean. A meteor could crash into London and destroy it. Just because something could happen, doesn't mean it will happen.

Indeed those things are unlikely. But what is more likely is a steady increase in EU migration to the UK. It's risen year on year, to almost 1/4 of a million this year. Not much you might say...no. But it's 250,000 more people who need a house. Perhaps if 1/10 are children, it's 25,000 more school places. If it keeps rising at this rate within 4 years it will be over half a million. By 2020 it will be over a million. I am not comfortable with that in the slightest. 

&gt; Immigration might not help that, but there are plenty of other factors that don't either, factors that parties like UKIP ignore in order to blame everything on the EU. By blaming everything on immigration and not dealing with the intrinsic problems behind issues such as lack of affordable housing and school places, you are only at best pushing back a problem, not dealing with it.

The thing is UKIP don't just blame everything on the EU. They have very clear policies for fixing internal issues too. Increasing house building and creating new grammar schools in every town.

""dedicated""?

&gt; giving the feeling's of these groups special privilege

I would have thought a more accurate, or less defensive, description would be that their ""state of being"" (though I don't agree that religion should be in that class at all) is given degree protection from discriminatory positions that have historically been used to 'keep people down', as it were. Although it's perhaps an extreme example, I do have trouble with someone arguing that freedom of speech includes the freedom to say e.g. ""Wog"". In such cases it's hard to find any justification for wanting to say words that viewed by the majority as racist terms that serve only to demean a minority group. That's not to say that ""Whatever most people think is what should be done"" and of course that shouldn't restrict books/art/performance: context is important.

&gt; Why give white males a privilege?

The guy then went on asking people for their thoughts on how politics can tackle environmental problems and he felt put on the spot when I told him that politics can't, only science can. It's scientists that are behind all of the green technology. Politicians are simply the mouth piece. He was then going on about how political campaigns can stop the big bad oil companies and I stated that political campaigns wont do anything more than raise public awareness. People aren't just going to quit their jobs because they are harming the environment when they are rolling in money as a result. It seemed like I was on my own in the room because no one else there actually had a scientific background or common sense. Felt like I was banging my head against a brick wall with him.

true,[deleted],null,null,"There aren't many Prime Ministers that looked Prime Ministerial in the preen way you're thinking of. From my head I can think of:

 Wellington (amazing military general, national hero and terrible Prime Minister), Lord Salisbury (led a pretty inconsequential, calculating administration by always playing the electoral Machiavelli), Lloyd George (OK - he was probably our greatest chancellor, but a pretty bad prime minister), Ramsey McDonald (compromised everything, failed to deal with the worst recession in British history by holding to the clutches of populaity) Harold Macmillan (""you've never had it so good"" in an openly racist country where the death penalty was legal; also took us into suez), Harold Wilson (promised a scientific revolution, didn't deliver much, halted most of his administration's achievements from ministers that wanted them, devaluation of the pound), Jim Callaghan (winter of discontent), Tony Blair (PFI, Cash for honours, Iraq and Afghanistan, surveillance, id cards need I say more and Cameron (ugh)

Whilst uncharismatic, derided and notably ""unprime-ministerial"" leaders include Attlee, Thatcher and Campbell-Bannerman.


OK - it might not be an exact trend; you've got heath as an unpriministerial failure and you've probably got a few priministerial people that led a good governments. 

But what I think the problem is that appearing suave and affirmative (Cameron literally spent his life in PR for this effect) has nothing to do with the every day business of leading a party, negotiating with foreign leaders, administering policy, developing relations with key interests and directing the country.  Plato made the analogy that the best ship captain is the one that knows how to drive a ship, not the one people would choose on these completely irrelevant terms. 

If you look at Ed's record, he passed the historic climate change act 2008 and secured carbon reduction agreements with world leaders in kyoto; he defied the media and shook the status quo by beating his brother in the leadership contest AND kept the party together after the rift occured, that had never been as divided as then together; he stood up against murdoch and called for leveson; he kept us out of Syria, he made and passed the biggest changes in the party's history to Labour's union relationship and he's made incredibly risky calculations in bidding for reform of key markets

That's more than ANY opposition leader has ever done before. And if you think of the things he hasn't done before, he gets even more impressive: No skeletons in his closet - he's not had a reckless childhood or had anything dodgy come to surface, he was one of the few 'saints' the telegraph made a point of highlighting when it came to the expenses scandal, he DIDN'T pass around negative briefs and didn't take sides in the Brown/Blair dispute described by Damien McBride. He didn't support the iraq war or any of new labour's excesses in terms of surveillance, id cards. He also hasn't used his family as political capital and refuses to do any of the soft-focus photoshoots loved by every other party leader since... forever. He's also not been involved in any scandals Guido Fawkes could write about. 


So yeah, do you want someone that's pretty to look at but doesn't have a principle in his body or do you want an honest, kind, *slightly geeky and awkward* guy that came into politics to change things as your prime minister?",1,1399238734,null,0,1399239487,0,ch9j1vh,t3_24ox1o,t1_ch9j1vh,t1_ch9hula,null,1433650315,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2
true,The_British_One,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"I respect the FT as a paper but that article is very poor. It cites no sources for it's figures and even so it contradicts itself. A 500,000 net migration into the country does not ""even it out"". Considering a large majority will be relatively well paid/affluent people taking their spending and high consumption abroad, while a majority of the EU migrants coming in are working in low-paid jobs. That has a bigger impact than they will admit. 

No, I would not demand anyone who has already used the freedom of movement to return anywhere. Whether that be EU nationals here, or UK nationals within the EU.

We have a net immigration however you measure it. That is not necessarily a bad thing, the bad part about it is that it is uncontrolled and unregulated. I'd be happy to have net immigration if we were controlling the standard of migrants - people who are coming to work in fields that we have a shortage of expertise in, people who will bring a lot of money into the economy and people who will benefit the country as a whole. But the fact that we have no say in who comes in is a problem to me. 

I've seen many facts that support what UKIP say but I'm curious to know what things they've said that you've seen disputed. 

I've never said I'd vote for UKIP, although I probably will in the EU/Local elections. Why am I concerned about the NHS? I'm a very strong supporter of the NHS. UKIP have never said anything about privatising it. Indeed in their most recent manifestos they've pledged to increase the numbers of front-line staff (doctors &amp; nurses) and decrease bureaucrats and management which is a good thing. The NHS needs to cut costs somehow. One way is cutting unnecessary management, another way is stemming immigration because that will always add to the pressure. And health tourism is a thing.

true,dublem,null,null,"&gt; actually he never apologised for using the word, he apologized for it sounding like he did. he has to apologize to keep his job, that's hardly what I'd call an admission of guilt, regardless of whether we agree on whether it is wrong.

""..begging your forgiveness for the fact that obviously my efforts weren't quite good enough.""

He's recognized that he did something wrong, and owning up to it. He doesn't say he begs our forgiveness for our lapse in judgement, it solely rests on his shoulders, and while he tried to avoid it going public, he was unable to do so, and apologizes for it. You can guess what his 'real' motives are, but at the end of the day, that's speculating in the light of the information we actually have in front of us.

Neither of us can see inside his head, so we can't know for sure that his claims to loathe the word are sincere. But to assume dishonesty with no greater reason than, well I don't care, so neither should he, is just fallacious.

Call it a lapse, Freudian slip, whatever. He said something he knows he shouldn't have, and apologized. He even tried to self-censor, but as he stated himself, obviously didn't do a good enough job. But to jump from that to that there is no harm in the usage of the word is not what he's trying to claim in any way, and it perplexes me that so many people feel that way. Regardless of whether it was a slip or not, it does cause racial agitation. That alone should be reason for a progressive society to actively seek its disuse.

&gt; I think it's just a word and nothing more harmful than that.

And I just struggle to believe that people believe that words have no power. That the idea of charged racial slurs being exchanged and considered fine in society won't (and didn't) affect the attitudes of others by communicating that the values intertwined with those words are ok.

For those not on the receiving end, there may be the knowledge that, individually, nothing is meant by it. But unfortunately, that's not what gets communicated. Had Jeremy been adamant that usage of that word is completely fine, it would be communicating more than just a colorful vocabulary. It communicates a particular worldview, one that is at odds with the values that lie at the heart of a tolerant, multicultural society. Whether or not that's actually how he feels isn't the issue, the issue is that people arguing for that to be ok essentially condone that worldview, and that is extremely troubling.

Like it or not, nonchalance towards a moniker communicates nonchalance towards what it represents. That's why it's considered in bad taste to make jokes about sensitive topics, because it says 'this isn't serious'. Where the topic involved is one in which people are currently suffering as a result, you'd hope that as a public there would be a desire to broach those topics with consideration and respect rather then flippancy, regardless of how they are treated in private.

Which comes back to my mentioning of my race.the vast majority commenting are likely people of the dominant race for whom racism is something you hear about on the news. It's far easier to be nonchalant about things which don't affect you than those that do, and to dismiss tongs that, to your eyes, aren't really much a part of the world we live in. Yes, others get discriminated against, but my mention wasn't to assert a monopoly, but rather to highlight that, where others might not be in a position to see it, this is still an issue, and shouldn't be treated glibly as something that isn't really relevant any more.

&gt; presentation is key to this issue

My point is, an argument is either reasonable or unreasonable. It's presentation is completely separate (unless done in a way that affects comprehension). My mentioning of my race didn't attempt to validate my argument, but simply give perspective as to why, in addition to my opinion on the matter, I found the situation so troubling. To use it as a means of discrediting a completely separate argument is like trying to discredit my argument based on poor grammar or writing style.

There's a ""wait and see"" mentality in the NHS, especially with non life threatening cases. Undoubtedly this saves money, and sometime it avoids unnecessary intervention, but it's not necessarily in the best interest of the patient.

Of course, the only reason you were treated promptly is because you paid cash. (I hope you got a cash discount?) If you had to argue with an insurance company it would likely take just as long as the NHS.

For me there are two problems in the housing market.
One, too many houses in London are being sold purely as investments. I remember reading 10 years ago that 50pc of all new build housing each year were sold to east-asian investors, I think that number has remained relatively unchanged since, with alot of housing now being sold as investments before they are even built. This means people who want to purchase a house are actually chasing a diminishing number of properties in London. This pushes prices up and forces people to move out, displacing demand and creating a ripple effect on prices in other areas.
Two, people who are buying in now are essentially buying in at the top of the market. If the Government increases supply, if they change the rules to discourage buying to let or for investment, if they create an atmosphere where confidence in a stable rate of return is damaged, then investors with large portfolio's may seek to exit the market and we could very quickly see an oversupply which will push prices down, leading to lots of homeowners being forced into negative equity or default, which in turn would lead to repossessions with the banks then trying to sell these properties which will create more of a downward pressure on prices.
Take for example Banbury, where we are. We know of at least two people who between them own around 200 houses, which they rent. If interest rates went up, or if they were restricted I how much rent they could charge and this impacted the rate of return enough to no longer make it worthwhile then you would slowly see them exit the rent market and reintroduce the properties into the general market.
There is alot of housing stock currently in this situation. 9m people in the UK rent, how many of these rent from buy-to-let landlords who are sensitive to changes in rates of return.
There will eventually be a correction in the housing market, the same as Ireland, it is simply a matter of how high a height we want prices to corrct from. The sooner we do it, the better for the whole economy but no government would want it to happen on thier watch.",0,1399240799,null,0,false,0,ch9jykl,t3_24po30,t1_ch9jykl,t3_24po30,null,1433650807,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,IIAOPSW,uk,"""the states""... don't look at me like that","When it goes into Dry storage, it is still very radioactive. It will continue to be human deadly for quite some time to come. The main difference between spent pool storage and dry storage is that when its ready for dry storage the decay power is low enough that the passive convection of air is sufficient to cool it. That is why if you look at a DSU you will find a vent on the top and a vent on the bottom.  

What are the hazards of under ground dry storage? Storage is not my specialty. If you want I can ask someone who would know more. But in the mean time I can guess. The most obvious problem is like you said, the water table. For the reasons I just mentioned, the dry casks are not air-tight. Water can and will get in them, corrode the zirconium cladding, and very possibly leak into the ground water. The other potential problem I can think of is flooding. If the dry cask becomes...a wet cask then I'm really not sure what would happen. I don't think there is enough fissile material left at that point to kick start fission by accident. However the ""convective airflow cooling"" might not work as well when you replace air with water. So worst case I could imagine is that the fuel gets hotter than it should be. I don't think it would get to melting temperature. But like I said now I'm speculating so don't take my word for it.

The fukushima event is a good example of that particular precaution not being enough (they only anticipated tsunami's 15 metre's high I think). Since fukushima, basically everyone has reviewed their own vulnerability to such an event. 

Unpredictable events are by definition unpredictable. So everything is built on the assumption it will break/leak/fail. As a result there are typically 3 or more systems that do the same thing for every task. The station blackout event that I mentioned is usually countered by having 3 backup diesel generators on site (you only need 1). The plant I was visiting in that picture still uses analogue switches. Not because they can't afford a computer, but because the crudeness is reliable. Any sensor or switch used in the operation has at least 2 redundant copies.  

On top of that, every plant has a mock-up replica of the control room. Inside the mock-up they do nothing but invent and simulate situations. Sometimes mundane, sometimes dire. The operators are very well trained (and very well compensated). 

Interesting aside, after 9/11 the US suddenly became interested in what would happen if you flew a plane into a nuclear power plant. The result: basically nothing.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"&gt; As an economist I'm going to have to take you up on this one. We will lose absolutely no trade by leaving the EU.

That isn't a guarantee. For one, one of the things we will lose by leaving the EU will be common regulations. Now, if I want to make a product and market it in the EU, there is only one set of regulations I have to follow. If we leave the EU, we will very likely end up departing from at least some of those regulations, meaning both companies in the EU and companies outside it will be less likely to market in the UK, as products fitting UK regulations will be a much smaller percentage of the market than products fitting EU standards. That's just one of the areas where we could be missing out on trade, as likely less goods will be sold in the UK.

While it wouldn't be a case where all EU countries stop trading with it, we would at least see some reduction, as I can't see any arguments that leaving the EU will strengthen our trade ties with EU countries. 

&gt; red tape

I don't like this idea that 'red tape' is inherently bad. For example, according to David Cameron things like regulation for minimum window sizes and minimum room sizes are red tape. Often 'red tape' is actually better for the people, and just because something is better for business doesn't mean it is better for everyone. If more 'red tape' and less profit for business means my quality of life is better, why is it a problem?

&gt; £55M a day isn't much...it's still £20 billion per year

And, again, for government spending that is a drop in the ocean. Dodged tax comes to something like £70bn per year, and nobody is talking about that.

&gt; Indeed those things are unlikely. But what is more likely is a steady increase in EU migration to the UK. It's risen year on year, to almost 1/4 of a million this year. Not much you might say...no. But it's 250,000 more people who need a house. Perhaps if 1/10 are children, it's 25,000 more school places. If it keeps rising at this rate within 4 years it will be over half a million. By 2020 it will be over a million. I am not comfortable with that in the slightest. 

I've argued this in other comments, but I think we look at immigration from the wrong angle. The majority seem to focus on removing the pull factors, with parties like the Tories trying to remove the rights of migrants, and UKIP going a step further by removing their rights to come here at all.

I would much rather focus on removing the push factors, such as low wages and low opportunities in many migrants home countries. I don't see why I deserve the benefits of living in the UK, yet foreigners don't deserve similar benefits. That's why I support staying in the EU, or an organisation like the EU, in order to further improve the lives of all people through co-operation, not just the people who talk like me. 

&gt; The thing is UKIP don't just blame everything on the EU. They have very clear policies for fixing internal issues too. Increasing house building and creating new grammar schools in every town. But leaving the EU will help fund this as well as stem a large part of the problem.

The majority of what UKIP focus on is the EU, and they never have a good word to say about it. I can understand disliking the EU, but to think it does absolutely nothing right is either ludicrously ignorant or purposefully misleading. And anyway, I think we should wait until the UKIP manifesto until we judge what their actual domestic policies are, seeing that what the closest we have is their 'Issues' page on their website, which goes into no detail.",0,1399247078,null,0,false,0,ch9mitq,t3_24opuh,t1_ch9mitq,t1_ch9ipew,null,1433652015,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Not all of them.  A lot of the actions were ghastly and no sane person could justify.

&gt;Utter scum, find a hole in the ground and stay there. 

Why did you ask a question, then follow it up with what you thought of me, without first finding the answer out?  Why ask a question if you don't even want a reply.

I don't really care what you think to be perfectly honest.  At the end of the day you're post history is full of comments such as this:

&gt;""Mainly because the term ""British"" has been hijacked by immigrants and their far left supporters. ""

and

&gt; ""And see, that's why there are so many nationalist groups rising across Europe. Europeans don't want white people to become minorities in their own countries. ""

Bunch of right-wing nationalistic crap, that has been shown to be false so many times over.  

Then we get to some real indications that you're a winner!

&gt;""Yeah, over my dead body.""  [In reference to a statement ""Will the island of Ireland ever be united as one?""]

Indicating that if a vote is held, and the people of Northern Ireland decide that they do want a united Ireland, you'd be willing to fight and die to remain a part of the union, and possibly plunge Ireland into another bloody civil war.  Yet, at the same time call me the monster for supporting some of the actions of the PIRA.  Interesting.

&gt;""If I walked up the Falls Road with my Rangers top I'd be a dead man. Stop making things up. ""

Classic!  Love it, I've already broached this one with you.  I'm sure if you did this you'd be fine.  Fuck, I know folks from the Shankil who have came into Sinn Fein's office on the Falls Road for advice.  

&gt;""ITT: ""Irish Americans"" who don't even have Irish heritage complaining about the UK. Stay mad potato monkeys""

You're a racist too, referring to Irish people, and Irish-Americans as potato monkeys.  We have a real winner here.

&gt;""Ballynahinch? Hey I live there! Where did you stay? ""

Good Pike fishing near Ballynahinch, lovely town, great people, shame you have to ruin it with your presence.

&gt;""What if I told you that you can eat food but still be intolerant of foreigners? Source: A guy who isn't fond of Indians but just had Indian food.""

More racism.

I can go on and on and on.  See this stuff that I quoted above, this I why you are a dinosaur.  Yes, I support some actions of the PIRA, but I also think that unionism and loyalism has a place in Northern Ireland, and Ireland as a whole, because it is an integral part of our collective history and culture.  I think the Orange order should be allowed to march their traditional routes, so long as they are not behaving in a sectarian and antagonistic manner.  I think that we need to move forward as a country and embrace all the good that we have going for us.  But with dinosaurs like you around we will never move beyond it.  The good thing is that, whilst people in the North move forward, folks like you will rot and wallow in your ineptitude, then fade into irrelevancy.  You are basically the equivalent of a fucking backwater hill-billy.  You entire post history is one giant racist, pile of shite.  Like I said in another reply to you I not even going to justify this with a reasoned literate response.  You don't deserve it.  You're an idiot.  The funny thing is that your a law-student and you what 18, so really all you know is stories that people have told you.  You've lived through fuck-all.  You where one year old when the Good Friday Agreement was signed son.  You know nothing about anything, I'll reiterate, you are a callow, immature child.  To end, and here's something that will blow your little DUP supporting head.  I know people, families of those shot by British soldiers in Ballymurphy who talked in private with the DUP.  The DUP want an enquiry into the shooting but they cannot come out in public in support of said inquiry because it would be political suicide.  So even the party you support, they are just playing you along so they can keep their lovely wee cushy job in Stormont.

true,dublem,null,null,"&gt; It doesn't matter whether Clarkson agrees or not

It definitely matters. The fact that a) He didn't just outright blurt the word out, and b) he didn't stand behind its use just highlights the fact that it's a bigger deal than just saying a random word from the dictionary. 

&gt; it's happened he's apologized and it grinds my gear when people think there is anything else to say on the matter

I completely agree. As I've said, he made a mistake, and owned up to it. I don't think he owes annoying else, and respect him for it. What gets me is the fact that people think he did nothing wrong at all.

&gt; I believe people are stronger than crying like babies over petty little words

That's incredibly naive. People stronger than you or I have been traumatized by words of neglect, driven to suicide by words of abuse, and are haunted by words which speak to past horrors. Words are powerful enough to give war vets flashbacks, keep dictators in power, and make or break relationships. They are the medium in which we operate as a society, and the primary vehicles by which we expose who we are to other people.

&gt; part of what I'm saying is that it's perfectly fine to have a worldview that doesn't chime entirely with the ""never offend anyone ever or fuck you"" agenda.

It's well within your rights anyway. And what I'm saying is, just because everyone's entitled to whatever worldview they choose, doesn't mean society has to accepting of those worldviews. Moreover, the worldview generally accepted by a society is of far more importance than that held by any one of its members. I have no problem with Jeremy Clarkson being a racist bigot (not to say he is one). Why should I care? What I do have a problem with is a society which doesn't seek to maintain a spirit of racial harmony and unity. 

&gt; yeah that's funny shit, that doesn't mean I wouldn't mind someone murdering babies or condone it in any way

My point is, that's not what it communicates. Someone who introduces themself with a racist/sexist joke communicates to others something of racism or sexism. They may be the loveliest person in the world, but that's not the conclusion most people would reach, and an understanding of them in that light would require further communication.

That's not a big deal when you're communicating with people who know you, or in a small, private group. but imagine a small country where talking and joking about killing children is considered par for course. No one actually does it, mind you, but any discussion of it is met pleasantly and with good humor. First of all, you can be damn sure that anyone with a proclivity for actually harming their children will feel far more at home with doing it than somewhere where there is social stigma attached. Sure, people get locked up for it, but hey, people get speeding tickets, but we all know there's nothing wrong with speeding? The message we send as a society is important.

As a result, think of the distress caused to people with children. As long as children being harmed still happens, then You don't know who's joking, and who actually feels that way. Sure, anyone who actually does anything illegal (and gets caught) will face the consequences, but knowing that someone who does you wrong might face legal ramifications for it afterwards isn't really much of a consolation, especially if the majority are in support of them rather than you.

So yea, it's a bit of a contrived and extreme example (to us, because rightly so, public consensus is that child abuse is an abhorrent thing to even make light of), but it still serves as a useful analogue, because the principles remain the same.

&gt; being the victim of racism gives you moral authority to decide what does and doesn't constitute acceptable behavior?

No, being one of many victims of racism shows that racism is alive and well in today's society.
