true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"However, our population growth rate is way below the US and Canada and historically has been much lower. Neither of those two countries have huge problems with house prices because they're actually building houses. You might suggest that because both countries are big land is cheap lessening any problem which is partially true but people can't sleep in the ground; you do actually need to build houses. You can have 1000 acres of land but if there's only one house between 50 people it will be very valuable even if the land it's on is cheap. Building houses is what matters most. 

Furthermore immigration is only unrestricted from EU countries and immigration within the EU up until about 2004 [was basically non-existent](https://fullfact.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/UK-net-migration-since-19911.png). Yet house prices have been [rising steadily since at the very least 2000, a time when there was basically no migration from Europe.](http://img.thisismoney.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/average_460x297.jpg) If we take a longer view we can see that house prices have been [broadly rising since the 1980s](http://monevator.monevator.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/house-prices.jpg) and in fact the only time European immigration is not basically nil is the very time house prices slump in the mid 90s before taking off again. 

It seems much more likely to me that the finance based economic boom of the 90s, the very free availability of credit combined with the fact that we build about a quarter of the houses we would need to service demand of our current population has more to do with the increase in house prices in the last 20 years not EU immigration. You will notice of course that non-EU immigration (which is 'restricted') has never ever been lower than EU immigration and in fact has been 2, 3 or 4 time higher. Even now, after the inclusion of Eastern European countries in the EU, non-EU immigration is still slightly less than 2 times higher than EU immigration. In other words if there is this pressure on house prices coming from immigrants as you say there is then 2/3rds of the demand is from those who got in via restricted immigration. 

I would dispute whether immigration has as much of an effect on house prices as you say, and I would suggest that any effect is magnified by the fact that we don't build enough houses, but even if I were to grant you that immigration is having a catastrophic effect on house prices then you should be twice as angry about non-EU immigration given 2/3rds of the immigrants demanding houses are non-EU migrants.

Because of the nature of the industry lots of models are classed as self-employed, even if they're just young teenagers, this often means they have no protection in situations like these, they have agents who want commission money pushing them in to photo shoots and no one safeguarding them and telling them they're allowed to say 'no' 

They're told that if they're not co-operative they'll be seen as difficult to work with and they won't get further work, it's one thing to expect an experienced 30 year old model to stand their ground, but much of the fashion industry prefers teenage models who don't talk back and don't know how to assert themselves. 

If you watch the catwalk shows or flick through fashion magazines you'll find loads of the 'women' modelling adult fashions are teenagers- some as young as 13 - and they're being thrust in to an adult world and being expected to make adult decisions without adequate support - unless they are lucky enough to have parents or an agent who will put their welfare above profit and lots don't.

[For example, when I have a look at this list](
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_(PPP\)_per_capita) I forget that what is even more shocking is that many in the US do not have access to health care that I think of as basic.  This is despite spending far more of their GDP on it.

I worry for two reasons, mainly because we are not comparing societies of linear wealth distribution.  This to me makes it pointless to compare a system that relies on general taxation, to one that is funded at point of use.  The same way we don't use mean average for income, but instead median and quartile ranges, I don't think it's fair to use mean average of health spending, as these figures will be distorted by income disparity, whilst masking access to services on an illness by illness basis.  A very expensive operation which is not life threatening, such as cosmetic surgery, could shift the PPP higher, suggesting that access to say cheap antibiotics is prohibitive.

When you compare different countries, which provide vastly different levels of service and types of health care, based on just one figure, it kind of misses the point.",0,1403093480,null,0,false,0,ciamuux,t3_28fzu3,t1_ciamuux,t1_cial3qy,null,1434292204,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Pay rent (£375)
Pay bills (£200)
Pay bus/rail pass (£80)
Throw a fiver at the overdraft. It may seem pointless but as far as the bank is concerned you are at least servicing that debt.

That keeps the roof above your head, the bailiffs away from your door and the ability to work sorted with £340 left over. Each week you can plan a £60 shopping budget which should get you and your girlfriend decently four times a month (and even have a couple of luxuries in that kind of food budget.) The first month or two you might find that you missed something off the list but that's ok; come back to the shopping list and adjust. Every time you come in under the £60 budget, add that money to the savings account.

The last £100 is up to you; it's all yours. Take your girlfriend out to dinner, buy a couple of new shirts, but be aware that once that money is gone it is GONE. You won't be able to do things any more. Remember that £67? That's for baby stuff as and when you need it. You will end up needing more than this for nappies alone but as long as you get the idea that you need to put some money away at least you will have the piece of mind that your kid will get fed and clothed even before your gf becomes eligible for benefits. Again, if you find yourself with change left over by the next payday, chuck it in the savings and start again at £1,000. Once you finish your apprenticeship and/or get a job earning more money you can start thinking about reducing your debt capital.

If you think the electric is far too high for what you're actually using, check with the landlord or just up and switch to another provider. £120/mo does sound high (for a 2 bedroom living space?) but if it's all electric mains heating water/stove/oven every day there might be a lot of wastage there.

I also haven't mentioned a fix because I don't have one. Neither does the government. It would require mass cultural change. It was in the news about fining parents who don't read to their children. Great idea but no way of enforcing or making it fair but maybe schemes that will focus more on making children read or be read to would be a better start than keeping them in school longer. Arguably this would mean they DO read more I suppose.

Personally, I don't think anyone really considers the knock on effect of keeping schools open longer. Increases in teaching salaries, later shifts for support staff with less time to prepare clean and prep the school, security risks in winter due to nights drawing in, etc. Each can be tackled but would require more money in a time when school budgets, or at least for some, are pretty tight.",0,1403093971,null,0,1403094274,0,ciamzlz,t3_28fzs4,t1_ciamzlz,t1_ciamhnn,null,1434292264,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,DV23,null,null,"Glad we got a player of his caliber, but I am still slightly worried. The wage bill has obviously dropped significantly with Diarra and Cole leaving but the fact we are spending significant amounts of money and still haven't ensured the needs of the team might be a problem in the future. WE NEED A LEFT BACK. 

I would be open to allowing Potts slowly into the team but as for now he isn't quite Prem standard and we would need a first team player for the next few years before he could develop into the player we need him to be. And with a nice chunk of money been spent already, can we afford to get a quality full back or will  we be resigned to getting another dinosaur reject.

The somewhat bright side or alternative solution the club have already considered is Diame would be leaving. Personally, I don't think he will ever achieve his top 6 ambitions at the current time and he would have to move abroad for his dream to play in Europe. Now, the grim side of it, the club may be letting Reid go.  I doubt the club would have spent such large money and not have a back-up plan with a lack of quality first team players, and with all the interest of defenders we attract I wouldn't be surprised but extremely disappointed if Winston Reid was let go. Obviously none of us want him gone, but the reality is Reid rumored to be making large wage demands whilst retrieving interest from top European clubs.Although I remain hopeful, I doubt the he will be staying with us for financial reasons and his personal ambitions.

So! Pretty much what I am getting at is: Will West Ham fall into another case of signing a 32+ player who Sam has connections with or will the club sell one of our top players to better the team all round. There is the chance the club will spend big, but at the moment I don't see it coming.

Citation? That is not my personal experience being resident in Z1. Can get appointments quite easily. Though maybe I have an under subscribed surgery. When i used to live in Z3 we had a GP office that was fairly clogged up with mothers with their young children and almost no one else anytime I ever visited. Would be interesting to see alternatives for GP services for children &amp; elderly and how much they contribute to the numbers. Perhaps a more lateral solution would become evident.

Perhaps we need more smaller GP surgerys distributed everywhere.

Free movement might not seem like a big deal but imo that's because we're all used to it, I still think it's pretty nifty.

It's allowed many companies to utilise highly skilled professionals in the west while allowing them access to the cheap labour of the east. Now this might seem a bit like ""Turk er jerbs"" but in reality it's allowing companies to exist and compete where previously they would not have been able to.

It accounts for billions of generated wealth in the UK, although Farage and his supporters will tell you that if we left the EU we could, on our own, generate *even more* wealth. They *could* be right (we'll never know) but what we do know is that free trade within the EU has been very good for us all.

Then there's all sorts of smaller things. The EU as a whole is the largest aid donor in the world. We have almost 10,000 EU soldiers deployed in a peacekeeping role. We are an organisation which many aspire to join.

In education, we have 4000 places of higher learning participating in the ERASMUS programme, which allows students from one country to do a semester in another. Over 5 million students have done this, and not only is this a great individual experience, but it creates more well rounded people, which I'd argue is a benefit to all countries.

Then there's the fact that the EU does actually look out for your privacy and rights (believe it or not). While national government's are largely deciding they can snoop on basically any of your electronic information, the EU was releasing a white paper on ECHELON a decade ago warning people to encrypt their e-mail. Similarly, while in the US there are big arguments about Verizon charging Netflix to deliver its movies, the EU parliament passed a net neutrality law this April which prevents ISPs from double charging as they're doing in the US.

As for race, what I'm suggesting is that different cultures would have different emphases on education which would partly explain the resulting disparity here. They did the comparison by only looking at poor kids so they've already adjusted the results for class disparity, which would mean that wealth wouldn't play a role here.

true,Etular,eng-cumberland,Cumbria,"To pull some figures out of my favourite book, ""Sleepwalking to Segregation?"" by Nissa Finney and Ludi Simpson (2008):

* 30% of all households are one person houses, compared to (on average) 24.2% of migrants households. For Bangladeshi people, it's only 8.8% who live in one-person households.

* The mean household size of all households is 2.35, with it being 2.96 amongst minorities. Bangladeshi people have the highest, at an average of 4.18. This is important as more people per household, of course, leads to less use of space.

* Measuring local living density per hectare, we find White British people using up far more space than any other ethnic group, at 46.2 people per hectare. The country average is 51.6, and 95.0 amongst minorities. Bangladeshi people have the most people per hectare, at 148.1, and thus make the most efficient and sustainable use of the space.

* Based on 2008 figures, the land area of England occupied by domestic buildings was 1,507,704,910 square metres. Assuming each house was an average 300 square metres, we could fit 5,025,683 people living alone, or 11,860,612 people of average household size - both figures falling far short of the actual population. However, if that space was used for a block of 10 flats (multiplying the previous figures by 10), it would be far more feasible, and in the circumstance that we adopted an average household size of 4 people then the flats would be able to cater for 201,027,324 people - over three times our current population of ~60 million, solely on the 2008 brownfields, without encroaching on any greenfield.

And complaints on behalf of someone else are not considered either. Nor are complaints about factual accuracy, unless there's the risk of legal action against the paper.

The PCC is still on the side of the Press and not members of the public who might have reason to complain.

It comes down to who could hurt a newspaper most: a celebrity who can afford a very good legal team and command lots of publicity could do a lot of damage to the Daily Mail. But from relatively powerless individuals in hated groups, the press are practically immune.

If you book a couple of weeks in advance it'll be around £15-20, instead of something like £60 each.

As for getting to and from the stadium, as /u/khaldoun_webster says - it's about half an hour walk, but I'd personally err on the side of caution and leave yourself an hour.

Tickets wise, you'll probably be best off going for Away tickets - home tickets will sell out as soon as they go on sale since Arsenal are a 'big' team so will probably sell out while they're restricted to members, and if they get to general sale, would sell out instantly. 

My guess is that your best bet is to get an Arsenal supporting friend with a season ticket to book them for you, or at worst trawl some Arsenal forums and see if you can find someone who would be willing to do so. Failing this, you could contact the club and see if they would be able to sort something for you, seeing as it's exceptional circumstances.

The only way you'd get any trouble is if you wore your Arsenal shirt in the Leicester end/celebrate their goals in the Leicester end - English fans tend not to like that very much.

Your assumption.   A false assumption.

Clearly a false assumption because you went from saying 'bullshit' to saying of 'obviously' what I was saying could happen.

You went from saying 'bullshit' to obviously it could even *increase*, and you based this 'bullshit' claim on an apparent absence of knowledge on your part that the majority of non-UK NHS staff come from outside the EU and that the NHS arranges visas for people.  Not only is it not bullshit, we can actively demonstrate it as not bullshit as we already hire more people on workvisas from outside the EU than those from the EU who don't need visas.

You even tried arguing that it's not like buying a plane ticket and somebody else who had done it said it very much was, especially if the employer arranges it for you and does most of the running - which the NHS does.

So all that was then really left of your argument was the secondary matter of standards, which you argued as far as you knew the GMC weren't particularly beholden as a regulatory body to accept lower EU standards, and *then* it was pointed out to you that that is exactly what the GMC is concerned about.  At which point you flipped and started arguing with the GMC.

You made a false assumption based on faulty knowledge.      
You then tried to blame me for my not making it clearer to you.  Sorry, no, the fault is at your end.

[Here's the original comment of mine again](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/27m2id/in_support_of_the_nhs_and_eu/ci24nas#ci24nas), and the bit you quoted with the in situ  context in brackets


       Every single one of those health professionals could be in 
       the country without the EU. [Just as many health 
       professionals who work for the NHS come from outside the 
       EU.]

       [The EU has nothing to do with it.]

So even when you say I hadn't clarified my position and that's why you made an assumption, the clarification was in fact in the very next sentence.

&gt;To me, it's bullshit and I don't have to think of the possible scenarios of how it could be done.

The very next sentence you quoted gave you precisely the scenario.  The same scenario we employ to those outside the EU coming to work in the NHS.

After trying to drum up competition for the deal (which pissed us and BR off) and finally realizing it wasn't going to happen, they came back to Liverpool and said ""Just kidding!

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;I based my response on the level of information provided and the current situation.

Only you didn't.  You actually omitted the next sentence which clarified the position.

The precise context (of being able to recruit from the EU as we do now outside the EU) which you later admitted 'obviously' we could do.

You omitted it.  Tried to argue that I hadn't provided enough context, but have since accepted when we look at how the NHS recruits outside the EU then obviously the NHS could be outside the EU and still recruit MORE from the EU.

&gt; It was clear that having a Brexit would mean less EU doctors UNLESS new solutions were to be incorporated. You haven't even mentioned about the idea of solutions which would HAVE TO BE MET in order to keep your assumption of ""could"". Therefore, my argument was perfectly valid.

It was in the very next sentence.

That we already do it very successfully for those outside the EU.   I said we recruit them, we already do something similar for those outside the EU now.

The breakdown was entirely on your side.

&gt;I don't have to know how the non-EU NHS staff is usually recruited but also this is not the same as with the EU workers. So yes, your sentence would be valid and I would admit I made a wrong comment if you have written it exactly like that:

So it was a comprehension problem from yourself, as the two comments I've made are perfectly consistent with each other.

&gt;As costs for the NHS would increase, while with non-EU nationals recruitment such costs already exist.

You're trying to deflect again.  The cost of running a recruitment fayre and arranging some visas is pennies to the NHS.  It's the lowering of standards and restriction of powers that concerns the GMC.

&gt;changing the situation from the EU nationals recruitment to the non-EU and comparing it to be the same is just worthless and I'm really surprised you fail to see it.

In case you've not noticed being in the EU costs the UK money already money.  We're a net contributor, and the excessive regulation which conservatively is estimated at costing 4% of GDP (frmr Commsioner Mandelson) and more exorbitantly at ~10% (Professor Tim Congdon) is an addition to direct contributions.

So when you try to deflect to additional cost to the NHS, ignoring that the GMC are also worried about their regulatory powers under the EU, then you're already on a losing wicket.

Of course you've just now introduced the other element which you said earlier you didn't want to get into, but now you've opened the door.   

If you want to start talking about cost to the NHS you can't detach it from the effects of uncontrolled immigration and the NHS's inability to predict demand and plan its service around it. 

So please....please....please....please.  If you want to hot potato away from how you omitted the context when you quoted me and went from saying 'bullshit' to 'obviously' we could do what I suggested, then please take it to how the NHS would have to pay because there's a lot more cost to the UK public purse and NHS being part of the EU than paying for a half dozen recruitment fayres in Europe and a preexisting department covering a little extra visa administration.",0,1403102404,null,0,false,0,ciaq1i8,t3_27m2id,t1_ciaq1i8,t1_ciape1h,null,1434293704,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

For example, Private Hospitals are getting more and more business (read: Operations and procedures) from the NHS. One Private clinic I was talking to last week are expecting to double the number of Cardiac procedures this year, based on outsourcing by the NHS. The surgeons doing these procedures? The same ones as in the NHS hospital next door. But of course they get paid more at the private clinic, and this costs the NHS even more. 

Eventually if this trend increases, the NHS will become non-viable and the Gov't can go over to a German or USA model (doesn't matter which - both are worse than we have here), making people get their own private healthcare cover - in the process trying to sell it as a better solution which will give the healthcare system more money to spend on patients - therefore increasing outcomes and improvements in patient care. If this happens, we'll pay for our healthcare ourselves, and the Gov't wont reduce our tax bill accordingly. 

All because they sold it to us as a better solution - ""Look at these results, we're number 1 in healthcare in the world, with less spent per patient than most. Just think how much better it will be with more money, if you get insured yourself...!""

Aside from the 'autobar' offences (murder, sexual offences and the like), the presence of a criminal record doesn't disqualify anyone from employment. The decision to employ (or not to employ, or to permit entry to a course) is one for the employer/body.

The case of the 17yo is, rightly, ridiculous. The college should have taken the context of the offences into account and offered him the chance to explain the circumstances, especially given the age at which the offences were committed. 

(although it's interesting that the matter wasn't dealt with under some sort of youth triage process - the current process for dealing with an 11 year old involved in offending wouldn't even countenance a criminal sanction unless he's already a hardened criminal)

He could be brought in to replace an unsettled Momo Diame at CDM. Last year we were without a proper CDM and it forced Mark Noble to stay home and kept him from utilizing his abundance of stamina and top-notch passing ability. With Kouyate in the midfield it could spell a breakout year for Noble.

Conversely, he could be brought in to ease the blow of losing Winston Reid, whose reported wage demands are in the neighborhood of double his current salary. If Reid goes, look for Kouyate to start the year behind Collins and Tompkins, with the aim of taking over for Collins at some point during the campaign.

Chadli had that one chance in the first half, which was 10 seconds of brilliance surrounded by 45 minutes of mediocrity.  

Paulinho has been fine.  Just fine.  Nothing more, or less.

Dembele doesn't create well with passing, but with his dribbling ability.  He was fine defensively, but needed help offensively from Hazard/Chadli to play off of in the first half, and he didn't get it.

Vertonghen was pretty poor.  The penalty was 100% on him (obviously) and he was petulant all match.  Against a more ambitious offensive team, it could have gotten ugly.

Bentaleb was a cog in the machine.

The office of fair trading in it's unfair terms in tenancy agreements does raise concern where the reason for cleaning is vague - a cost would be fair if reasonable and in line with failure to take care of the property.

**OP** - Was your deposit protect and were you served the prescribed information? If not then there are a lot of ways this may work out. If you're on individual tenancy agreements then you will need to  each act individually, if you're all on one tenancy agreement then you will need to nominate one lead tenant with the consent of all other tenants to take things forward.

If the deposit was not protected, then you cannot be evicted with a standard section 21 notice until the deposit is returned in full. As you're a student you probably don't intend to stay, though this is a useful bargaining tool should you need it. If you have not yet left you may want to raise with the landlord that they're liable for up to 3x the amount of the deposit in compensation if it has not been protected, another useful bargaining tool. Finally, if there's 9 of you and you're sharing bathroom/kitchen facilities then you're probably in a HMO which needs to be licensed with the Council so there's another thing to check that may persuade your landlord to stop being unreasonable.

If it was protected, then the landlord will need to raise a dispute with the scheme it was protected under, they will not hand over any money unless you either agree to it, or you agree to go to use the alternative dispute resolution service the scheme provides. If you agree to go to the ADR, they will award a proportion of your deposit to the landlord to cover anything they see as covered by the deposit, eg. cleaning, damage, rent. The landlord cannot gain betterment of the property through these deductions, as various other posters have said landlords should account for wear and tear and the deposit service will take this into account.

If you do not agree to using arbitration and the landlord still wishes to raise a dispute then you will have to go to small claims court to get the deposit back. Going to court isn't very easy and you might not think it's worth the time and hassle. My own opinion is that you should go to court if you feel like the landlords charges are unreasonable but be aware that the court may not necessarily find in your favour, it costs money to file your case with the court and so you may end up with a lot of stress and no clear win.

You should talk this through with Shelter as the internet isn't the best place to get legal advice and several comments in this discussion already are inaccurate.

""If you are going to have a supposed buy-out clause it should be that, but it is different as it says if there is no qualification for the Champions League [by Liverpool] and if there is a minimum offer of £40million then the parties will get around the table to discuss things but it does not say the club has to sell.""

""It quite clearly states £40million is a minimum offer for discussions, but it becomes really difficult with such clauses.""

""There is a 'good faith' clause in relation to serious discussions but I can't say it is cast-iron buy-out clause.""

Liverpool took the stance that 'no' was the serious discussion whereas the Suarez camp could have claimed that a simple 'no' was in violation of the 'good faith' portion of the agreement.  It would have gotten down to legal semantics and been a long, drawn out ugly affair if Suarez had continued to push but as the outcome was by no means certain he eventually relented and instead took a nice pay raise.

Negative equity just means your house is worth less than the mortgage secured against it. As long as you can make the repayments, it doesn't matter if the house is worth nothing, you won't be evicted. Anyone who is financially responsible will be able to make their mortgage payments unless the interest rate goes way up. 

I own a flat and have a mortgage. I paid a certain amount for it at the time I bought it, and I can pay the mortgage for it. If the flat ends up worth less than I paid for it in 2006, then that's just something I have to deal with, the mortgage provider won't repossess it just because it's worth less than the mortgage.

It's not enough to proclaim that the quality of British or BBC comedy is declining, that doesn't help anything or anyone.

Clean sheets are a collective achievement, not an individual one. Top sides keep more clean sheets than relegation fodder.

I posted that blog as it gives sources and was quicker than spending an hour or so I don't have, tracking them down from a few months ago. Having watched what Thatcher did, and lived through it, I am very sensitive to it happening again. The Tories subscribe to the idea that everything- absolutely everything, has a monetary value and that the free market will balance things out. It hasn't worked- they brought in rampant consumerism which only favours a few. Their ideals bring about massive inequality- which really doesn't affect them. Certainly the unions needed to be brought to heel a bit, and yes, they did get ridiculous- I remember THAT too- but the changes which should have improved things for the better simply did not work out long term. In order to get elected, Blair brought Labour severely to the right- we lost the balance- then we have a coalition which isn't working as people hoped- the libDems have not contained the Tory push at all. The NHS is not a sacred cow- nothing is- they are flogging off probation - do you think THAT a good idea? Public services have been contracted out to the highest bidder through both Blair and this government so much that we got used to the idea and somehow it doesn't seem that terrible. It is- because it creates a massive conflict of interest- between profit and services. Interestingly many members of the party- and of other too have interests in private healthcare firms which will be bidding for services..again- conflict of interest.

One is one isn't.  I just think you don't understand something.  Calling you an idiot was a personal dig.  If you don't like being called an idiot, maybe don't be an idiot?

&gt; If it isnt all that bad, where are the top players we were linked with? Where are the successes of the transfer market? Where is the world class quality?

Why do you expect us to be linked with top players?  It seems like there is a dynamic in world football that you are kind of missing.  It is a bit more complicated than ""I like Liverpool; they are good; they should get everything I want them to have.""  Sometimes we cannot get the toppest of top players because of our transfer model.  That's okay.  And is being linked with Sanchez, Lallana, Shaqiri, Moreno, etc not good enough of links?  Now mind you, we still have our evaluations on those players that we will not go over.  The process is complicated, simplifying it to the point you are is not good for understanding.

&gt; The proof that we have failed time and time again to land our prime targets is there for all to see. 

The proof that we have succeeded time and time again to not overpay for our prime targets is there for all to see.  See what I did there?  Two sides to every coin.

&gt; but we already had a chance to wrap up Lallana and Moreno. What did we do? Get dragged into the mess Southhampton have made.

If we had it your way what would we do, overpay every year for every transfer and be in absolute financial turmoil???  Come on.

&gt; And not accept payment terms of Seville.

Why would we?  They deemed it not suitable financially.  They didn't just say no because they want it their way.  Your thinking the selling club is always right seems peculiar.

&gt; If we think Moreno is a good player, which our bid does show, why then dont we compromise a bit and bring in top quality?

I assume FSG think they are already compromising quite a bit.  Don't you?

&gt; I think among all your posts and arguments, this is the most stupid one. We dont need world class players?!? Ok, Sir. Ok. 

That was never my argument, but I'll bite.  Did we need them to have a stupendous season last year?  What would any one of those missed targets added to make us do better?  Would Mkhitriyan have made Gerrard not slip?

I was never saying world class players would not benefit us.  Just that missing out on the one's we have has not been as detrimental as you are making it seem.  We have a great squad and right now we are just strengthening,

&gt; The weight in my argument is the failed dealings time after time for any reason.

You keep saying that like it actually has weight.  You are not weighing the potential financial turmoil of overpaying into the equation.  That is dishonest and myopic.

&gt; Ayre has been at the club long enough and has failed more times that not at closing deals.

That is extremely disingenuous of you.  You do not know what goes on in those boardrooms and what limits Ayre has, so saying he is reason for the ""failures"" is just a lie.

&gt; You know about the inner workings? Kindly fill me in with some proof if so.

You do realize me criticizing your argument is not the same as arguing the extreme on the other side?  I am saying --as I have been the whole time-- that the situation is a bit more complicated so rushing to judgment that we are a joke is a stretch.

&gt; I'm going by what I see as a supporter, that is failed dealings time after time.

true,slippyg,null,null,"No one here can tell you what your landlady is planning, but she cannot just keep the money.

Were you provided with an inventory when you moved into the property? If so the house should be in a similar condition less reasonable wear and tear, for example, if there is a carpet directly leading from the front door and this carpet has been in the property for 3 years, you would expect it to be worn out through natural use. The important thing is to remember that the landlady cannot gain betterment from the deposit i.e. she cannot use it to make the house *better* than before you moved in.

Since your deposit is protected the landlady will have to raise a dispute with whichever scheme the deposit is registered with. If you agree with the landlady then the deposit will be returned to you less the amount she has claimed for. If you disagree with the dispute, you and the landlady may ask the deposit scheme to use the alternative dispute resolution service. An independent adjudicator will award a proportion of the deposit that they feel is reasonable, given all evidence submitted by both parties, if they think the landlord has no case then they will not make an award. If there's no inventory and no photos it's going to be difficult for the landlady to claim anything.

If you do not agree to using arbitration and the landlady still wishes to raise a dispute then you will have to go to small claims court to get the deposit back. Going to court isn't very easy and you might not think it's worth the time and hassle. My own opinion is that you should go to court if you feel like the landladys charges are unreasonable but be aware that the court may not necessarily find in your favour, it costs money to file your case with the court and so you may end up with a lot of stress and no clear win.

As you say ""we"" if you are in one single agreement with several people you will need to nominate a lead tenant to try and reclaim the deposit on the groups behalf, if you are on your own tenancy agreement and it only covers your bedroom, you are not responsible for the sofa unless it's part of your bedroom.

In my mind, if you've lived there for a few years and the stain is the only problem, you shouldn't be looking at a huge chunk being taken. That said, although it was probably an accident, the landlady can claim for the damage to the sofa. This doesn't mean she can have a new sofa though, you would expect her to be awarded an amount to clean the sofa, less allowances for age.

Contact Shelter or the Citizens Advice Bureau for advice on getting your deposit back through small claims court, or speak to your council to see if they have a private rented/tenant relations team.

He has companions -- often earthlings (and if so, often young women) with whom he adventures and fights baddies.  The Doctor can also regenerate when mortally injured, so he's been played by a number of different actors.  (When we here refer to ""Ten"", we are talking about the 10th regeneration of the Doctor, aka the 10th actor to play him.)  

Doctor Who was mostly gone for the 1990s - early 2000s.  In 2005, it was started up again, and since then, there have been 3 actors in the role, and there will be a 4th starting this fall.  By and large, it's a series that's meant to be joinable at the beginning of new lead actor, so if you want to start with the watching this fall, it should be understandable.  If not, go back to when Matt Smith started his run in 2010 and they should start with the basics all over again.

Stop being a fucking condescending cunt. I've heard enough personal bullshit from you. 

&gt; Why do you expect us to be linked with top players? It seems like there is a dynamic in world football that you are kind of missing. It is a bit more complicated than ""I like Liverpool; they are good; they should get everything I want them to have."" Sometimes we cannot get the toppest of top players because of our transfer model. That's okay. And is being linked with Sanchez, Lallana, Shaqiri, Moreno, etc not good enough of links? Now mind you, we still have our evaluations on those players that we will not go over. The process is complicated, simplifying it to the point you are is not good for understanding.

Are you stupid? Are you actually stupid enough to say as a fan we shouldn't expect top class players? I am the most pessimistic when it comes to the club, but I have full rights to wish that the club signs top players and wins stuff. And not just being happy we arent overpaying. I'm not talking about links. I'm saying being linked is not enough. Bring the top targets. Which Ayre has not.

&gt; That was never my argument, but I'll bite. Did we need them to have a stupendous season last year? What would any one of those missed targets added to make us do better? Would Mkhitriyan have made Gerrard not slip?
I was never saying world class players would not benefit us. Just that missing out on the one's we have has not been as detrimental as you are making it seem. We have a great squad and right now we are just strengthening,

What the fuck then was your argument? That you first say that we didnt need those players? And then you use that great last season to justify that? Bloody brilliant. So second every year needs to be our target, based on your statements.

&gt; You keep saying that like it actually has weight. You are not weighing the potential financial turmoil of overpaying into the equation. That is dishonest and myopic.

I keep saying things that have proof. In that that Ayre has not landed any top targets from the ones I mentioned earlier. You can argue why or why not. But it's there for you and everyone to see that we are going nowhere in terms of transfers with Ayre. That is the basis of my talk. What he has failed to do at critical times. I know you'll deny that, but you have nothing to prove that. 

&gt; That is extremely disingenuous of you. You do not know what goes on in those boardrooms and what limits Ayre has, so saying he is reason for the ""failures"" is just a lie.

Youre defending him is just insane. I dont know why, but you seem to love the guy. He is a failure, thus we miss out targets every window. 

&gt; You do realize me criticizing your argument is not the same as arguing the extreme on the other side? I am saying --as I have been the whole time-- that the situation is a bit more complicated so rushing to judgment that we are a joke is a stretch.

I'm going by what is out for everyone to see that Ayre has failed in us missing out prime targets every window. What do you have to go by in terms of backing your argument for? All you're doing is countering what I say yet have no information otherwise. How can you anyway, the players are not at Liverpool due to Ayre and our joke of a transfer policy. 

&gt; I'm going by what I see as a supporter, that is successfully not overpaying time after time.

Fair enough, it shows where your priority lies as a supporter, the balance sheet.

I've always argued that loyalist ideology is a source of racism - supremacism, domination, and entitlement of a minority are all at its heart (including the concept of monarchy). These ideas informed British policy in Ireland through the ages; both partition itself and stormont rule was basically ""let's create a better 'minority' and keep the resources from the untermench"", which is happening in this instance too. It's why McGuinness and Sinn Fein don't pander to racists anywhere, have allies in South Africa and Palestine and are the largest electoral force in this country trying to purge these toxic attitudes. Contrast Robinson's idiocy with McGuinness who hasn't put a foot wrong. That's leadership - and totally vindicates his political vision.

Because a percentage of students will not turn their offer into an actual degree place, the university gives out more offers than places, knowing that some will turn down (insurance &amp; firm...) or not make the conditions of an offer. 

But an Offer is an Offer. If I get an offer to study Law at Cardiff, nobody can take that away from me. So if more students accept the offer than they expected, then they have to make room for the extra students (hire more staff, double teach lectures that won't fit in one lecture theatre etc).

Nothing we understand can be be understood without the proper context and ground work, you can't go back in time and drop the ideas of quantum physics on a people who don't understand why things fall down.

Equally if god touches a human mind they might be able to fully understand god but how can they fully communicate that understanding to others who haven't? They can't unless god does the same thing to everyone or the peoples understanding of the universe and their place in it is near already perfect. Result is that if we presume that part of whole mess is that we have to try and work some of it out for ourselves (if we didn't and god does exist we'd already know but we don't so the likelihood would be that he doesn't but still that's only *a* view) we can expect a peoples understanding of god to evolve as their context for that understanding changes. In that sense rejecting old concepts based on old context isn't a scramble to hold on to beliefs but an evolution of them. Hell if god *is* the universe as some thought would put it and we are only just starting to understand the true nature of it then all past attempts must have been inherently flawed by definition.

The same applies with professional cleaning.

If the landlady is claiming an outrageous amount be taken for both carpet cleaning and professional cleaning, I recommend OP requests proof of payment for both carpet and professional cleaning that she claims took place prior to the let to be produced by her before they incur those costs. 

If she cannot produce them, again, she should chuff off. They'll do their best with the cleaning and if she doesn't like it, tough. The protection schemes will 99.99% go with OP on this one, and so would a court.

OP, please note that if you cannot come to an agreement with your landlady about the amount to be returned, and you lodge it with your protection scheme, the landlady still has the right to refuse going through that disputes process, but then you can take her to the small claims court.

Tiresome. I'm having to deal with some severe egos at work at the moment and I've had to stop myself from banging out extremely vitriolic emails on several occasions. Today I told my boss that I was considering leaving when my contract expires next week because they're wearing me down, and I can go elsewhere and get paid the same and *not* have to deal with this shit.*

I also almost punched a security guard there on Monday.

There's something in the air... still, I told my boss about various incidents today and she's having none of it. So future piss-takers will be getting strongly worded emails from her telling them in no uncertain terms to back off. 

However, there *is* wine. So I've got that going for me.

&gt; The property should be returned in the same condition it was let in, bar wear and tear. So if the landlord had the carpet professionally cleaned before he let it, the tenant has to have it professionally cleaned too.

This isn't strictly correct. The perceived level to which the landlord has a property cleaned has no bearing on the cost the landlord can bring to the tenant at the end of the tenancy. I can clean a property to a 'professional' level (and have done!) this doesn't mean the landlord can say ""well I paid for a professional clean at the start of the tenancy so I get one at the end too"" if the property is already in a clean state. The office of fair trading is pretty clear on this.

&gt; OP, please note that if you cannot come to an agreement with your landlady about the amount to be returned, and you lodge it with your protection scheme, the landlady still has the right to refuse going through that disputes process, but then you can take her to the small claims court. At that court, it's at the judge's discretion, but they are allowed to award up to three times the amount of your full deposit back to you.*
*although I might've seen something on Reddit recently claiming that this has been successfully legally contested? Anyone?

I think you have your laws mixed up. Tenants are entitled to up to 3x the deposit if the landlord fails to protect the deposit at all. If the landlord doesn't want to use ADR or the tenant doesn't want to use ADR then the only way to sort it out is to go to small claims court, this is a choice made by either side (although the DPS will return the money to the tenant so the onus is really on the landlord to start court proceedings) there's no penalty for either party until the court decides and it's not uncommon for people to use small claims court rather than the DPS.

An inventory is fine but if it's done by the tenant then no arbitrator or court is going to take it seriously, inventory should be done by a third party, not the landlord, then signed off on by both tenant and landlord at the time the tenancy starts.

And the victory won by women (whether working ,middle or upper class) in gaining work opportunities came at a cost to the working class. A glut of supply. That doesn't mean I condemn women working, your sensitivity to such a mild comment is quite intolerant and anti-intellectual.

&gt;problematic

this is a leftists word for ""bad"", but they don't allow themselves to just say ""bad"" because it shows how childish their argument is. 

Its a nothing word

&gt;This is being set up as a heavily moderated subreddit, with the intention of providing a more sane, welcoming place for people being driven away from /r/ukpolitics[2] by the growing prevalence of positions like that amongst the userbase. 

So to boil this down to what it actually means is:

This is an area where YOU (and one other moderator who also has very similar views to you) can ban people whom express views which you disagree with.

I think that your pretense that this is to maintain a higher quality of posts is laughable considering the sophistic comments made by you and  the other moderator all over /r/ukpolitics and to me this subreddit is nothing more than a control freak who wants to stamp out dissenting views.

&gt;And, make no mistake- people have been driven away by the casual, reactionary sexism of the place.

Its laughable to establish a heavily moderated subreddit under the pretense it is more welcoming. Doublespeak. 

So no. It isn't more or less obvious. What are the definitions for racism, sexism and homophobia. Your reluctance to provide any suggests you are already building this place up to suit your own agenda, you are affording yourself wiggle room whereby the ""moderators discretion"" is code for ""what I say goes"". 

Now thats all well and good. Do what you like, but why are you so deceitful about it? Subterfuge.",0,1403119616,null,0,1403120258,0,ciays7i,t3_27vt61,t1_ciays7i,t1_ciayhwa,null,1434297894,0,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,0

Either way we were not part of that tourism drive. How much money have we missed out on because of that? Never mind that as an all Ireland body our tax paid for it in part. 

Pulling in tourists, keeping the money flowing into the tourism industry, and thus creating jobs and helping the economy should have come first here.

true,Girlwithnousername,null,null,"&gt; This isn't strictly correct. The perceived level to which the landlord has a property cleaned has no bearing on the cost the landlord can bring to the tenant at the end of the tenancy. I can clean a property to a 'professional' level (and have done!) this doesn't mean the landlord can say ""well I paid for a professional clean at the start of the tenancy so I get one at the end too"" if the property is already in a clean state. The office of fair trading is pretty clear on this.

I'm possibly being a bit dense here, it's a long day, but this paragraph seems to contradict itself. 

&gt;I think you have your laws mixed up. **Tenants are entitled to up to 3x the deposit if the landlord fails to protect the deposit at all.** If the landlord doesn't want to use ADR or the tenant doesn't want to use ADR then the only way to sort it out is to go to small claims court, this is a choice made by either side (although the DPS will return the money to the tenant so the onus is really on the landlord to start court proceedings) there's no penalty for either party until the court decides and it's not uncommon for people to use small claims court rather than the DPS.

In addition to the above bolded part, if a landlord has signed up to a deposit protection scheme but refuses to use their dispute service to resolve deposit disputes, the tenant is then entitled to take them to the small claims court, and the up to x3 deposit amount refundable also becomes applicable.

Romance here being less a boy-girl romance, and more of an all-encompassing love of hope, and earthly critters, and the deranged impossibility of there being an earth, and earth surviving. Sounds like happy cheesy times, but ooooff does it get dark sometimes. They do not talk down to children. I love it as a 20-something child myself.  
  
I've gotten 4 of my friends hooked on it so far. There are a few ways to clamber on board more gracefully than i did in the beginning! In order of time-commitment levels:  
  
* (few hours) **Watch a few standalong episodes.** Blink, or The Girl in the Fireplace, The Empty Child / The Doctor Dances, or Midnight (seriously, brrrr). Don't sweat that the Doctor guy and his companion person are different each time for now, they always make it clear who the clever smugathon (doctor) or the inquisitive, heart of gold, trouble-getting-into-er (companion) is.  
  
* (few days) **Start with Season 5.** New doctor, new companion, new story arcs; it's a very comfortable jump on point for new viewers, and it was engineered that way! They were introducing themselves officially to America, and got it's tush slapped as it was gently shoved, blushing onto the stage. 

* (few sleepless weeks of marathons) **Start with Season 1.** I did, I don't regret it, but there will be ups and downs over 7 seasons. And a lot of wonderful silliness and tears. And a couple of dreary moments. It has the especial bonus of featuring my favourite doctor, Nine, who with his cartoonish proportions, mercurial moods, wide grins and caustic humour first charmed me into this world. I also think he's probably the most relatable to Adults of An Offspring-Having Age.

* This list ignored the old Who serials pre-2005 reboot because I had to have a life outside of this. I would love to catch some good old Who bits one day...

The legislation in question is as follows:

    213 Requirements relating to tenancy deposits

    (1)Any tenancy deposit paid to a person in connection with a shorthold 
    tenancy must, as from the time when it is received, be dealt with in accordance with an authorised scheme.


    (1)Where a tenancy deposit has been paid in connection with a shorthold tenancy, 
    the tenant or any relevant person (as defined by section 213(10)) may make an application to a county court on the grounds—

    (a)that the initial requirements of an authorised scheme (see section 213(4)) have 
    not, or section 213(6)(a) has not, been complied with in relation to the deposit; or

    (b)that he has been notified by the landlord that a particular authorised scheme applies
    to the deposit but has been unable to obtain confirmation from the scheme administrator 
    that the deposit is being held in accordance with the scheme.
    
    (3)The court must, as it thinks fit, either—
    (b)order that person to pay the deposit into the designated account held by the scheme administrator 
    under an authorised custodial scheme,

    (3)The court must, as it thinks fit, either—
    (a)order the person who appears to the court to be holding the deposit to repay it to the applicant, or
    (b)order that person to pay the deposit into the designated account held by the scheme administrator under an authorised
     custodial scheme,within the period of 14 days beginning with the date of the making of the order.
    
    (4)The court must also order the landlord to pay to the applicant a sum of money equal to three times 
    the amount of the deposit within the period of 14 days beginning with the date of the making of the order.  

Legislation doesn't cover the return of the deposit, unfortunately, from the moment the deposit is protected the above doesn't apply. Also worth bearing in mind that courts in reality are not always awarding 3x the deposit and that claims will have a counter-claim by the landlord, potentially further complicating matters.

[Bit of a push](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy). But, this isn't really the right forum for that discussion. 

&gt;this is a leftists word for ""bad"", but they don't allow themselves to just say ""bad"" because it shows how childish their argument is. 

Think what you will. It's a word with legitimate uses, irrespective of your position. 

&gt;So to boil this down to what it actually means is:

&gt;This is an area where YOU (and one other moderator who also has very similar views to you) can ban people whom express views which you disagree with.

&gt;I think that your pretense that this is to maintain a higher quality of posts is laughable considering the sophistic comments made by you and the other moderator all over /r/ukpolitics and to me this subreddit is nothing more than a control freak who wants to stamp out dissenting views.

I've never denied that the whole point of setting this place up in the first place is to try and get a forum together that resembles the /r/ukpolitics of a year or two ago- before the massive influx of far-right foghorns. That this happens to coincide with, at least initially, strongly discouraging the participation of particular members just comes with the package. 

&gt;Its laughable to establish a heavily moderated subreddit under the pretense it is more welcoming. Doublespeak. 

I'll be blunt. 

The intention's to make this a welcoming space, *for the people that haven't been turning /r/ukpolitics into a UKIP/psuedo-EDL circlejerk for the past six months*. /r/ukpolitics has become an extremely unwelcoming place for a good many people, lately. This place exists to compensate for that.

Well if this really is the case, then Shelter have been giving out some terrible advice. If any lawyers browsing can confirm this, I'll contact them and advise them, because knowing this could've made my life an awful lot easier when I had a dispute.

&gt;Also worth bearing in mind that courts in reality are not always awarding 3x the deposit 

I agree, but did I not say 'up to x3'? If not, this is true.

&gt;and that claims will have a counter-claim by the landlord, potentially further complicating matters.

This is also possible (and legal). But in my experience they don't want to incur even more legal costs and spend the time on it. But this would depend upon the amount. If a court awarded the tenant their full deposit back, thus depriving a landlord of whatever they're claiming in cleaning costs, I could see the landlord saying 'sod it, I'll suck up the loss.' However, if a court awarded the tenant x3 the amount of the deposit back, they would probably consider that worth fighting for. 

I think it also depends on how big the landlord is. If they own many properties and/or have a managing agent: yes. A small time landlord who owns one or a handful of properties is far less likely to go to court for the sake of what could be a couple of hundred quid.

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"GCSE + A Level syllabuses are 5 years all together. You have Henry VIII/Elizabeth, WW1, WW2 are periods which will inevitably be prioritised. My brother is doing 'Crime and Punishment' as theme throughout his GCSE syllabus and as part of that he does medieval punishment but also deportation during the British Empire. He wouldn't learn about other aspects of British imperialism however because it wouldn't fit with the them. I did Irish history from 1798 to 1921 which encompasses a lot of British imperial dickishness but I never learned about the Opium Wars. 

In other words, I suppose what I'm trying to say is that certain aspects of the British Empire are covered. WW1 and 2 could be considered important parts of British imperial history though we don't tend to learn it from that perspective. However to cover 'The British Empire' would mean covering 500 years of history in great detail involving hundreds of years of histories of India, Pakistan, China, Ireland, South Africa, Egypt, Kenya, Rhodesia, Somalia, Iraq, Afghanistan, British protectorates in the Levant, Australasia, The USA, Canada, Argentina, The Caribbean and many many more places. It would be a true achievement to study the British Empire in it's totality in a lifetime let alone 5 years of school. You can focus on each country which is sometimes done as it was when I studied Ireland (my teacher had planned to teach us about the British Raj before the year's syllabus was settled) but to learn about British imperialism is far to large a topic to attempt during a school class without leaving out important issues or covering it very superficially.

A word having legitimate uses doesn't make your use legitimate.

If you're unwilling to give definitions for your own rules then you have no purpose bandying around the word ""problematic"" besides disguising your value judgements.

&gt;I've never denied that the whole point of setting this place up in the first place is to try and get a forum together that resembles the /r/ukpolitics of a year or two ago- before the massive influx of far-right foghorns. That this happens to coincide with, at least initially, strongly discouraging the participation of particular members just comes with the package.

You haven't denied it but your language is clearly intended to disguise it. You're sing words which are connotative of inclusiveness and open mindedness, while you set out to quell opinions you disagree with.

Perhaps the ""influx of far-right forghorns"" is representative of a real life paradigm shift. And your subreddit would therefore be a misnomer.

&gt;The intention's to make this a welcoming space, for the people that haven't been turning /r/ukpolitics into a UKIP/psuedo-EDL circlejerk for the past six months. /r/ukpolitics has become an extremely unwelcoming place for a good many people, lately. This place exists to compensate for that.

But it does totally the opposite.

You're fracturing and fragmenting a userbase. 

You're turning an ""unwelcoming place"" into a right-wing echochamber by drawing away leftists to your own circlejerk of left-wing politics.

Its not compensatory. Its the complete antithesis of the purpose of a forum and discussion. If people feel that their views were in the minority than maybe they actually are, and heading off to create a safe little hideout where you can delude yourself otherwise is totally counterproductive.

&gt;In my mind, that's a perfectly reasonable goal. You may well disagree. In which case, you're free to post elsewhere.

I'm sure that seemed like it was going to be cutting, but really it just drives my point home.

I don't know what advice shelter give, I don't work for shelter and am unfortunately not a lawyer. I know that shelter are an excellent charity but it would not be the first time that that the finer points of law were missing from their website. I can't speak for the face to face advisors or phone line guys as there aren't any here and I don't know how well they're trained.

Your deposit is yours, giving it to the landlord to protect doesn't make it theirs, or the DPS's. If you request it back at the end of the tenancy and the landlord does not wish to use the DPS to come to a resolution, they must give the money back. In my mind this makes sense, I am not sure how well I am phrasing this.

Essentially you are giving money to a third party for them to hold, if the landlord doesn't wish to use this third party, the third party must return the money.

Here's what the Deposit Protection Service say:

&gt; The ADR service can only be used where both parties agree to resolve the dispute through it, and to be bound by the decision. If one party states that they do not wish to use the ADR service, then resolution of the dispute will have to be taken through the County Courts or resolved by way of an agreement. 

https://www.depositprotection.com/help/browse/custodial/agent-landlord/alternative-dispute-resolution

true,Girlwithnousername,null,null,"&gt; Your deposit is yours, giving it to the landlord to protect doesn't make it theirs, or the DPS's. If you request it back at the end of the tenancy and the landlord does not wish to use the DPS to come to a resolution, they must give the money back. In my mind this makes sense, I am not sure how well I am phrasing this.

Two things: 

1) the money for the deposit is not held by the DPS, it's held by the landlord. In the event of a dispute arising, the DPS will request that the landlord send them the deposit funds for them to hold until the outcome of the dispute has been finalised. If the landlord isn't playing ball, they will simply refuse to transfer the funds to the DPS. So, there's no money there for the DPS to give back. 

2) which makes:

&gt;Alternatively if the deposit has not been returned to the tenant by the time it goes to court, the court can order the DPS to repay the tenants, or, the tenant can apply for a third party debt order.

completely invalid. The DPS don't have any money to give to anyone.

&gt;I know that shelter are an excellent charity but it would not be the first time that that the finer points of law were missing from their website. 

If you are speaking from having analysed their website and having come to your conclusions based upon the information they provided and your unqualified legal analysis of the law, then I'm afraid you and I have been having this discussion for completely pointless purposes. If Shelter really do know the law, which I hope they do, because it is what they are paid to do, then what I have stated above is correct, and your response is sadly invalid. I have spent a very long time seeking advice on this matter through them.

TL;DR - the deposit protection schemes do NOT hold deposits, the landlord does.

[Your actions in this thread, in particular, would lead to an instant ban from /r/BritishPolitics](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/28fxyi/this_is_how_racism_takes_root_the_demonization_of/). In fact, the comments on that post are *exactly* the kind of dogwhistle bollocks that's driving people away from /r/ukpolitics. 

For example: 

&gt;Pedophilia is a part of muslim culture.

But, yes. 

&gt;If you're unwilling to give definitions for your own rules then you have no purpose bandying around the word ""problematic"" besides disguising your value judgements.

Because, to most decent people, it's desperately obvious what they mean. If you're particularly desperate to learn what sexism, racism and homophobia are, pick up a book on the subjects. 

&gt;You haven't denied it but your language is clearly intended to disguise it. You're sing words which are connotative of inclusiveness and open mindedness, while you set out to quell opinions you disagree with.

It's a moderated subreddit. Even /r/ukipparty have banned racists before. 

If you're after completely free speech, toddle over to /r/GBRPolitics. This place is moderated with the intention of keeping it in a position of, while being by no means a ""safe space"", a place where people don't scan the comments and instantly think ""Christ, it's like an EDL rally in here"". 

In short? We're *inclusive and welcoming* to people who want to play by the rules. Which, unfortunately, doesn't include you. 

This isn't seeking to ""quell opinions""- it's creating a space outside the presently existing spaces where opinions can be expressed without a swarm of racist fuckwits immediately descending on you screeching about how Islam's destroying everything good about this country/Immigration is a left-wing plot to destroy Britain/WHYDOYOUHATEPATRIOTISM/""You're black. You're not my fucking countryman"", and the like. 

That's its purpose. We don't hide that. If you intend to participate here in the manner in which you've contributed to /r/ukpolitics, you're very likely to incur a ban in relatively short order. 


&gt;Perhaps the ""influx of far-right forghorns"" is representative of a real life paradigm shift. And your subreddit would therefore be a misnomer.

But it's self-evidently not. The surge in right-wing posters coincided *exactly* with the /pol/ raids. 

&gt;But it does totally the opposite.

&gt;You're fracturing and fragmenting a userbase.

&gt;You're turning an ""unwelcoming place"" into a right-wing echochamber by drawing away leftists to your own circlejerk of left-wing politics.

We've spent the past six months trying to drag /r/ukpolitics back to being something less awful. We've failed, and it looks like there's little prospect of circumstances changing anytime soon. 

/r/ukpolitics already has days where it's a right-wing echochamber, with any moderate view crushed straight to the bottom beneath idiots like Bulldog and mjaumjau vomiting forth a tidal wave of bile into the place. When the place has become as intolerable as it has, there's nothing wrong with building a lifeboat.

&gt;Its not compensatory. Its the complete antithesis of the purpose of a forum and discussion.

Not every forum has to cater to absolutely everybody. By excluding far-right bigots, we're not exactly limiting the scope of discussoin- we're creating a space where, again, it's possible to say *anything* without it being instantly derailed into a kipper/EDL circlejerk.

&gt;I'm sure that seemed like it was going to be cutting, but really it just drives my point home. 

It wasn't intended to be cutting at all. It's a statement of fact.

Oh?  Are we getting into personal digs?  How rude.

&gt; Are you actually stupid enough to say as a fan we shouldn't expect top class players?

Yes.  We, as fans, should know our capabilities as a club.  And overpaying is just not in the financial model we have.

&gt; I am the most pessimistic when it comes to the club, but I have full rights to wish that the club signs top players and wins stuff. 

We're getting there.  Like I said, it is more complicated than ""buy everyone I want because we are Liverpool and we are great!""

&gt; And not just being happy we arent overpaying.

Well... you see, overpaying led to things like Andy Carroll, Stewart Downing, and Charlie Adam... which led to poor seasons.  Not overpaying and making solid deals (Coutinho &amp; Sturridge) led to things like second place.  Combined with Rodgers of course.

&gt; I'm saying being linked is not enough. Bring the top targets. Which Ayre has not.

We've been over this; Ayre has not brought in the top targets because of parameters outside his control, like how much we evaluate the players.

&gt; So second every year needs to be our target, based on your statements.

Buying [top targeted] players does not mean a championship, look at Tottenham.  We don't have the money that Chelsea and Man City have to buy ALL the players we could ever dream of.  Come on.  We just can't do some of the things you want.  Smart buys, our great coach, and building our youth setup to match our system is how we get better and better.

&gt; I keep saying things that have proof.

Uh what.  Saying that we missed out on players is not proof that we are a joke or that Ayre is worthless.

&gt; In that that Ayre has not landed any top targets from the ones I mentioned earlier.

Just saying that he hasn't landed them is not proof of anything.  You are leaving out LITERALLY every other factor.

&gt; But it's there for you and everyone to see that we are going nowhere in terms of transfers with Ayre.

Smh.  Just no.  Quit simplifying the process so much so that you can blame JUST Ayre.

&gt; What he has failed to do at critical times.

How exactly has he failed again?  What EXACTLY did he do?  I'll wait... 

I don't have to prove that it is all his fault, because YOU are the one making the claim that it is all his fault.  The burden of proof is on your shoulders and I have explained time and time again how there are more factors at bay.

&gt; Youre defending him is just insane. I dont know why, but you seem to love the guy. He is a failure, thus we miss out targets every window. 

Still waiting on that proof...

&gt; I'm going by what is out for everyone to see that Ayre has failed in us missing out prime targets every window. 

This is a logical fallacy known as 'ignoring a common cause'.  Just because Ian Ayre has the job he has and we missed out on our prime targets does not mean there are not other factors at present.

&gt;What do you have to go by in terms of backing your argument for?

I have talked about how we evaluate players at a certain level and refuse to go over.  I have talked about how players have chosen other teams.  I have even talked about how we never made bids in the first place.

&gt; How can you anyway, the players are not at Liverpool due to Ayre and our joke of a transfer policy. 

It is true the players are not at Liverpool because of our transfer policy.  But it being a joke is still naive thinking.  

&gt;Fair enough, it shows where your priority lies as a supporter, the balance sheet. Me, I'll take the club winning silverware via buying world class players

I think it's certainly heightened them. She herself has been bullied by an absolute twat this week and had to deal with a case of a member of admin staff considering lodging a complaint against said bully too (I'm going to take him to lunch next week and encourage him to make it official). She regularly gets her colleagues shouting in her face, and despite being there for 19 years and doing current shouty job for five, is also considering going back to her former career (outside of current place) when her contract expires at the end of next month. However, we agreed that the best plan in the short term is to a) shout about our cunty colleagues to one another as therapy so that neither of lose the plot and b) raise this on the list of priority issues that our new top cheese has to deal with. The main problem is that HR refuse to get involved in disciplinary issues, all they'll do is offer advice. So the managers have to deal with everything themselves, and all officially complaints and disciplinary matters are extremely time consuming. I'm going to contact some senior HR manager people I know to see if they can help me build a case to get funding for a new member of HR who is dedicated to this specific issue... because it is rife, it is rotten, and people have been allowed to get away with talking to one another in whichever manner they deem appropriate, screaming, blaming, undermining authority in meetings, and so on for FAR too many years. We're both hoping the new top cheese will have no tolerance for this and will support us. He's already been to a meeting with us both (which I thought was quite moderate for this particular meeting - they're usually far more utter-arsey) and confided to her that it was 'bordering on unacceptable.' 

So perhaps there's a light at the end of the tunnel.

&gt;hope it helps you find peace! (or at least relieves the stress!)

It is for now. I shan't log onto my work email again tonight. The trouble is, drowning stress and anxiety in a glass of wine is all too easy. It's a bad habit I need to kick myself out of.

true,rev9of8,null,null,"The under-occupancy penalty (to give it its proper name as it appears in the relevant legislation) also ignored why councils tended not to build one-bedroom properties but rather built two- or three-bedroom properties - the reason being flexibility.

A one-bedroom property can at most house two people who are living as a couple and only supports two occupancy configurations. A three-bedroom property can allow you to house many more different occupancy configurations from a single person up to a family of six. You also have the advantage that if a person gets married and has kids then you don't have to go to the time and expense of having to re-house them. Two- and three-bedroom properties also do not cost proportionately more to build than a one-bedroom property. 

Consequently, councils and housing associations preferred to build two- and three-bedroom homes.

As a result, many people who were single or couples ended up getting two- or three-bedroom homes because that was what most of the supply was and it was quicker to house them in those than waiting until a one-bedroom home became available.

It's not even as if you could really justify the under-occupancy penalty on cost grounds. A one-bed council flat has a rent of approx £300 pcm in my city with a rent of £400 pcm for a three-bed council flat. If you have a single person living in a three-bed flat then because of the under-occupancy penalty that person would have their housing benefit reduced by 25% meaning it would only pay £300 of their rent with them having to find the £100 remainder.

As there is a very limited stock of council/housing association one-bed flats they can either be massively worse off for a protracted period of time or they can rent a one-bed flat in the private sector (assuming they can find a landlord who will accept DSS tenants and they can scrape together the deposit and moving costs). Except... typical market rent is £550 pcm for a one-bed flat and Local Housing Allowance pays up to £495 pcm for a one-bed flat so the government would be shelling out almost one hundred pounds more per month and the tenant is over £50 worse off per month.

Why are you so unwilling to offer definitions?

We both know that the definition I read in a book might not coincide with the definition which you follow. So what would be the purpose of me learning the definition of the term? What matters is YOUR definition. And your unwillingness to offer definitions suggests you want to be able to ban people willynily. 

Muslims aren't a race, sex or sexuality. So to suggest that my comments on a culture are somehow in breach of one of those terms suggests that you do have a very bizarre definition. 

So just post it. Exactly. And let it stand on its merits and give people something to go by. This is your chance to create a moderation standard which offers a semblance of transparency and consistency; which is something that is important to founding a forum. I'm not saying you have to offer rules which allow me to post, but you should offer rules. Not vague ""thats dogwhistle!!!!"" ambiguity. 

I mean effectively what has happened is, I've asked you a definition to the single rule central to your entire purpose for creating this post. And all you've been able to do is flounder around trying to dig up posts I've made on a different subreddit which you personally disagree with (but offer no justification as to why).

&gt;In short? We're inclusive and welcoming to people who want to play by the rules. Which, unfortunately, doesn't include you.

I'm asking you to define the rules.

Which, unfortunately, obviously isn't going to happen.

I can't ""play by rules"" which are held in secret. You dunce.

&gt;But it's self-evidently not. The surge in right-wing posters coincided exactly with the /pol/ raids.

But the /pol/s say otherwise. We have a conservative government in power and a right wing party in the EU. You're shocked that there are conservatives online. Thats all. Leftists are too used to having the internet all to themselves, and when they meet someone from the other side they pack up their toys and run home.

&gt;We've spent the past six months trying to drag /r/ukpolitics back to being something less awful. We've failed, and it looks like there's little prospect of circumstances changing anytime soon.

So instead you'll go make a different awful place, but because you like the smell of your own shit - you'll love it.

The blanket charge is meant to address the first problem. The trouble is, it risks deterring the poor (pensioners in particular) from seeing the doctor when they really need to. And unfortunately a lot of the people who make excessive appointments appear to be pensioners, so exempting them from the charge is pointless.

Fining people for not turning up will not in itself prevent a GP's time being wasted. If I make an appointment for next week, and I wake up on the day feeling better, what do I do? Fail to attend and get fined, or turn up pointlessly just to avoid the fine? Either is a waste of their time. Of course any decent person would phone in out of courtesy, but you would still get fined.

They would need a system where you could cancel, ideally at quite short notice, to avoid the fine. Then they would have to give the appointment to someone else.

true,slippyg,null,null,"&gt; Two things:
1) the money for the deposit is not held by the DPS, it's held by the landlord. In the event of a dispute arising, the DPS will request that the landlord send them the deposit funds for them to hold until the outcome of the dispute has been finalised. If the landlord isn't playing ball, they will simply refuse to transfer the funds to the DPS. So, there's no money there for the DPS to give back.

I've got all my deposits transferred to the DPS through BACS transfer, and repaid in the same way - Must have been dreaming when I did that.....

I am going to assume that you've never protected a deposit as a landlord or agent, but in any case there are two ways to protect a deposit.

The insured scheme is where the landlord keeps the cash and repays funds at the end of the tenancy as necessary, this costs a small fee to the landlord in the form of insurance and so the DPS can repay the tenant at the end of the tenancy if the landlord refuses to do so. 

The custodial scheme is where you pay the deposit in full to the DPS, as I have described above. You can pay by debit card, bank transfer etc.

I am fairly sure you can register with one of them and set up a fake address and try and allocate a deposit to it, it should ask you how you want to do it - either way the DPS pays out. You can Google this and there's a great many sources which will back me up, I don't think it's a point worth arguing on.

&gt;If you are speaking from having analysed their website and having come to your conclusions based upon the information they provided and your unqualified legal analysis of the law, then I'm afraid you and I have been having this discussion for completely pointless purposes. If Shelter really do know the law, which I hope they do, because it is what they are paid to do, then what I have stated above is correct, and your response is sadly invalid. I have spent a very long time seeking advice on this matter through them.

I'm speaking as a housing professional with a great many years training, I am familiar with shelter as I deal with them on a daily basis and have a background starting in lettings although for the life of me I can't imagine why I gave that up.....

true,LocutusOfBorges,,Liberal Democrat | /r/LibDem,"&gt;Why are you so unwilling to offer definitions?

Because they're self-evident, and because if we were to post exhaustive definitions, we'd have people bending over backwards to get around the letter of the rules, ignoring the spirit of the rules. 

Definitive statement on the matter? ""If you don't know what 'racism' is, you're probably not welcome"". 

This won't be /r/srsukpolitics, by any stretch- but stuff like this is simple enough. 

&gt;This is your chance to create a moderation standard which offers a semblance of transparency and consistency

I feel it's perfectly adequate as it stands, thank you. 

If somebody's going to quibble endlessly over how the average mjaumjau post's ""not racist"", they're not welcome. Similarly, if somebody completely flies off the handle and starts commenting on anything relating to Islam without the necessary caveats and respect to the people affected, and cries ""LEFTIE CENSORSHIP"" when they get called out on it by people that *still agree with some of your points*? They're probably not welcome. 

&gt;I'm not saying you have to offer rules which allow me to post, but you should offer rules. Not vague ""thats dogwhistle!!!!"" ambiguity. 

We have. And, bluntly, it's obvious enough when someone's reeling out the dogwhistle stuff. Whenever, say, dearest Bulldog comments on an article involving non-white Britons? ""Oh, I love being culturally enriched."", or ""Hurrah, diversity!"", it's pretty fucking obvious to anyone with knowledge of their posting history what they mean. 

""Clarification"" on this stuff isn't necessary. The rules were deliberately drawn up to include a significant degree of moderator discretion- we'll be accepting applications for more people to join the mod team when we've finished setting the place up tomorrow. 

Primarily? It's to keep the worse offenders of /r/ukpolitics out. That *requires* moderator discretion. 

&gt;Well you would be. But you won't actually be excluding far right bigots. You'll be excluding anyone who steps further than centrist. 

You have a funny definition of ""centrist"". 

&gt;Which really shows a lot dosn't it. Because /r/ukpolitics has allowed you to post for weeks on end with flair urging people to leave their subreddit. And they've done nothing against you. While I have asked you for a clarification of your own rules, in the appropriate thread, and you're trying to usher me to the door. 

As I've made abundantly clear, this isn't /r/ukpolitics. People with right-wing views are welcome to post, *so long as they don't step over the line*- where ""the line"" roughly matches ""what you'd expect to hear in polite company"". 

&gt;Just post the definitions and stop being so stubborn.

&gt; The custodial scheme is where you pay the deposit in full to the DPS, as I have described above. You can pay by debit card, bank transfer etc.

We have massively crossed wires here, so I do apologise. I was indeed referring to the insured scheme. I wasn't aware that there is such a thing as a custodial scheme. What are the differences between the two, and in which renting circumstances do each apply?

&gt;I am fairly sure you can register with one of them and set up a fake address and try and allocate a deposit to it, it should ask you how you want to do it - either way the DPS pays out.

The US have been shipping weapons to FSA (moderates) who admit to working with Al Qaeda/Al Nusra who's members have defected to ISIS.

The US were training ""opposition fighters"" in Jordan.

The US and UK were warned that removing Saddam Hussein would cause a power vacuum and sectarian violence but ignored it.

The Gulf States are arming and sending Jihadis into Syria which have spilled into Iraq.

What is pretty clear is that there are 'sides' in this that are clearly drawn in the sand. US/Saudi Arabia/ Qatar are funding and arming ""rebels""with no way of stopping them from giving/selling those weapons to extremists. Then you have Iraq, Syria and Iran. Iran is trying to prop up Assad and maintain it's influence in Iraq. Whatever you think or Iran or Syria or Iraq, they are a damn site better than total chaos with the worst of the worst in power. 

The problems have been caused by those funding terrorists whether you believe it's directly of indirectly doesn't matter. I don't expect anyone with half a brain would think that the US would arm ""moderates"" and not expect any of the weapons to reach extreme hands. Then you have Saudi Arabia trying to spread their power and influence over the Middle East with the use of militants supported by other Gulf States. ISIS is an offshoot of Al Qaeda which has been armed indirectly by the US/Gulf States.

Times I've had to wait 4 hours(the legal maximum) just to be admitted then discharged so I can wait another two hours. Some of my friends have lost limbs to botched operations(MRSA). Others have had to wait over a year to get things seen.

I have two members of my family that have worked for the NHS all their life(a GP and a surgeon). One believes that the NHS should be ""humanely euthanized"" the other is quitting due to the horrific treatment they get by the NHS as an employer. I just don't understand why myself and everyone close to me is trapped in some bizzaro world where we get such bad treatment. Really just how bad is it everywhere else in the world for this to be the best? 

The only way for me to see my GP is to mass dial at 8 in the morning. After about 30-40 minutes I might be lucky and I'll get an appointment for that day only. If my doctor isn't in that day or they're full? Tough luck. Try going through that every day when you've had a stroke. It's insane.

Other than that, I told my Devil Wears Prada manager to go fuck herself (I paraphrase for dramatic effect) via telephone in 2001 and had my notice on her desk when she flew back from New York, for the second time, because the previous time I did so she talked me out of it. In the year prior to my joining (and I endured two years of her - I as of the 'I won't let this fucker beat me' attitude until a long chat with my stepdad about being careful with which battles you choose to fight), she got through six of me. She sacked my replacement at the end of her probationary period three months after I left. 

Now here's a bit of irony for you: because I am confident and say what I think (sometimes without thinking, I'm not very good at touchy-feely), someone at work who is very senior and should be qualified enough to know personality types at work once asked me if I'd bullied my current office-mate to leave as well as the last one who'd buggered off after a few months. It transpires that this lady, who I get on pretty well with, used to do my bosses job, and throughout her tenure, gained a reputation of being possibly the nastiest bully the place has ever had. 

TL;DR I don't fucking like bullies, and everyone bar a few handful of people at my current place can go fuck themselves! ",0,1403126275,null,0,false,0,cib2bem,t3_28gxc4,t1_cib2bem,t1_cib1cu7,null,1434299646,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2

The Golf Union of Ireland didn't split after partition of the island (like the IRFU, but unlike the IFA/FAI), so  it remains an Island wide organisation. As there is no British Golf Union, or Northern Irish golf union, he could only have ever played for the Golf Union of Ireland as it has jurisdiction over the land in which he was born.

Now, we all know that NI is a special case, and it's citizens all by right have the choice of which political and national identity they consider themselves to be. Rory, in this case, considers himself more Irish than British and therefore I fully support his choice to represent the Republic.

Emmanuel Adebayor has been put up for sale as Tottenham Hotspur attempt to rejuvenate their forward line and cash in on the Togo striker while he has a significant valuation.

Tottenham believe their best opportunity is to sell him this summer because he has two years left on his contract and his wages have dropped to about £85,000 a week, about half of what he has been earning since permanently joining the club two years ago.

The difference in money was effectively topped up by Manchester City as part of an exit agreement, although that agreement ends this month, making his salary less prohibitive for suitors.

Adebayor is also a victim to Tottenham’s preference to sell outfield players above the age of 30. Jermain Defoe was 31 and Scott Parker 32 when they were sold, and the policy also makes vulnerable the defenders, Benoît Assou- Ekotto, 30, who has one year left on his contract, and Michael Dawson, 30, who has two years left on his contract.

Adebayor scored 14 goals after being brought in from the cold by Tim Sherwood, the former Tottenham head coach, in December, having been sidelined after he fell out with André Villas-Boas, Sherwood’s predecessor.

The row erupted after the striker returned from compassionate leave after the death of his brother in July a year ago. Adebayor refused to move to Besiktas, the Turkish club, last summer when his wages proved prohibitive for other clubs and held talks with Queens Park Rangers, who may be interested once more after returning to the Barclays Premier League.

Less clear is whether Roberto Soldado, also a striker, will leave White Hart Lane. Tottenham have interest from Atlético Madrid and a return to Valencia is not out of the question because only half of the £26 milion fee remains to be paid to the Spanish club.

Tottenham’s targets include the strikers Romelu Lukaku, of Chelsea, and Jay Rodriguez, of Southampton, and they have an interest in James Ward-Prowse, the midfielder, and Toby Alderweireld, the Belgium defender. Tottenham looked at Alderweireld last summer but he moved from Ajax to Atlético Madrid, where he has struggled to command a regular place.

Tottenham, who will tour the United States in July, have announced they will play Schalke in their final friendly on August 9. The German side are likely to include Kevin-Prince Boateng, who spent two years at White Hart Lane from 2007.

Besiktas want to sign Kostas Mitroglou on loan from Fulham to replace Hugo Almeida, who is expected to leave this summer. The Greece striker played little more than 150 minutes for Fulham in three appearances because of a knee injury. He completed an £11 million move from Olympiacos, in his home country, to west London in January.

Churchill fell out of politics due to his health. Hell, for the last year of his leadership he wasn't even at the helm, he was unwell and out the public eye.

""You are aware Lloyd George (liberal) is accepted as being the creator of the welfare state when Homes for Heroes was introduced after WWI, creating social housing, and when he created the state pension, or when he created national insurance to provide income when people were sick?""

There were versions of those things in place before WW1. However they were not as far reaching.

Why?

Because up until 1909 (and even shortly after that), governments had nowhere near the fine control they do now. When the 'Peoples Budget' was introduced in 1909, the power it required the Government to have caused a constitutional crisis that left Britain (and the Empire) without a government for *two years*.

Things really arent as simple as you think they are.

""I think I'm going to need some evidence that the tories did more than labour (created the NHS) and Liberals (created the welfare state) to aid the poor of this country...""

The conservatives throughout the 1800's pushed through a variety of reforms. The main one i can think off the top of my head is the housing reforms sometime in the Mid-1800's.

Sterling relies on his pace quite a bit, but he has the ability to beat defenders without merely sprinting past them - he actually has surprised me a lot of times this season with his strength either shrugging off challenges or wrestling the ball from opposition players.

I think in part it's because they're completely different players - Sterling doesn't have anything like the touch and composure to reliably put the ball into the back of the net that Owen had, but I also feel that Sterling isn't quite as one-dimensional as Owen was in terms of the way he benefits the team (as is demonstrated when he's played through the middle and his pace is less important than it is out on the wing).

Have you any evidence that the place was not in perfect condition when you moved in? If not then you're on the backfoot. Having said that, your rent does include something for wear and tear, so if you've been there 6 months+ and it was pristine at the beginning it would be acceptable for there to be some marks on the walls etc (CAB advice); the longer you've been there the more wear+tear that would be reasonable.

If you'd been careful with food &amp; drink and always taken your shoes off at the door, and vacuumed at least once a week then the carpets would be in the necessary condition? If you've not kept to that regime then undoubtably they warrant cleaning if you've been there more than 3 months - hire a Rug Doctor or similar, it won't be expensive or hard work between the 9 of you?

Right now we are going through a transitional period where we have been appointed a new head coach (manager) whose name is Mauricio Pochettino. We previously had a manager called Tim Sherwood who was not very successful, hence he was fired (sacked).

In my opinion our best player is called Christian Eriksen who is a young, Danish midfielder who is a very bright prospect. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Es1YXxI_Us (highlights from last season.

As a club we aspire to finish in the top 4 which basically mean we can play in the champions league (best European club competition) however in the last few seasons we have failed to do so. In fact we have only played in the competition once where we were knocked out in the last 8 by Real Madrid.

I think I am speaking for most here when I say that we are looking forward to next season as we have a new manager who has an attacking play style.

Brace yourself for the bumpy ride that is Tottenham Hotspur.

I bring it up people just say things like ""oh, well it's probably because Brits are overweight and drink a lot"".

Whenever I tell people about the mistreatment I faced which actually made my health worse (permanently, I have to live with it for the rest of my life), they just say ""well you can't know if it would be different in another country (I can, I'm in another country now, it has been better here the moment I landed), or start going on about how ""do you want to privatise it?! do you hate the NHS?!"".

The NHS seems immune from criticism, even as the problems are discussed in newspapers (even the Guardian), which scares me. Access and costs are important, but it is a *healthcare* system and I'm worried about the standard of healthcare provided.

But at the end of the day, if people don't want acknowledge the problems and try to fix them then they're the ones who have to face the consequences. (I haven't said anything about privatising the NHS, I don't want it to be, especially not by handing out contracts on monopolies the way the Tories seem to believe. I just want it to work, for patients.)

We have ""quick access to specialty services"" but the second lowest ""healthy lives"", which covers death rates for conditions treatable with medical care - just above the US where many people can't see specialists. That doesn't seem right to me.

And with all the talk about how great access is, there is nobody discussing the huge regional variations in the standard of care you relieve, the ""postcode lottery"". Even if the NHS is amazing and does work properly in a few areas, that doesn't justify people suffering unnecessarily in other areas solely because they live in the wrong place.

Sneijder - tough choice for mind, but he was just so quiet and didn't really do anything on the midfield. Runners up, Robben, Van Persie and De Jong

Mat Ryan - unfortunately. Just didn't look his usual self today. Should have dealt with that third goal a bit better. Runner up would be either Spiranovic or Wilkinson. Twats. ",0,1403133841,null,0,false,0,cib5t6p,t3_28i1kf,t1_cib5t6p,t3_28i1kf,null,1434301268,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

Secondly it is worth bearing in mind that we live in a country where just over 38/39% of people voted for parties which have a very clear stance on 'the constitutional question'. People in the north are free to hold British and Irish citizenship if they so chose. Soccer players have been doing this for ages(I saw someone describe them as being 'poached' I don't think the FAI are shooting them with tranq darts and smuggling them south I think they willingly go :) ). Current Olympians(Paddy Barnes a bronze medallist in London 2012) have chosen to represent Ireland over team GB. Someone from N.Ireland deciding to declare for Ireland shouldn't really be that big of a shock should it? We live in a society where (in theory) we should all be able to hold identities and act on them in any way we please as long as it's legal and doesn't upset anyone. You might not like it but you have to at least respect it. I accept that the situation here is somewhat unique but a quick look at the world cup or international rugby will show you sportsmen are free to represent whomever they choose.

Australia is more obese than the UK, yet comes fourth on the healthy living scale. The disparity in outcomes is obviously entirely down to lifestyle.

It's a *healthcare* system, yet nobody seems to care about the standard of healthcare provided. And how efficient is it really, for the nation, if people die or become unable to work?

I want the NHS to work, (I **don't** want it to be privatised) but we can't improve it if people are incapable of acknowledging the problems and pretend that its perfect even as it disintegrates in front of us, choosing instead to insult people who have suffered because it threatens their view of the NHS.

Biggest example is probably the time when the private property rights were established; as opposed to the previous era where everything was owned by the State (read: Crown).

Of course, the real problem is that 'right wing' and 'left wing' are ill-defined terms, and only really relevant as a relative measure anyway.  Therefore it's very difficult to give answers that involve those terms, spanning long time periods.

The reason we give welfare to the very poor or health care to the sick is because we don't currently have the technology to become a post-scarcity society where money is meaningless and disease doesn't exist. These policies are born from fundamental physical limitations of the universe - not social constructs.

In contrast, so-called positive discrimination is a step away from equality in the opposite direction. Any organisation which implements positive discrimination could just as easily completely ignore people's gender/race/sexuality/religion/etc, which is supposedly what all the positive discrimination advocates want.

A better analogy (although still a slightly contrived one) would be this:  
A person invents a device which can produce an almost infinite quantity of _stuff_ on demand, at zero cost.

The reason BAE went after Moukandjo was because Moukandjo was out wide close to the goal line with two Croatian defenders staring him dead in the face. Benny was just off the corner of the penalty area on the same side calling for the ball. He should've received it as he was COMPLETELY unmarked. You could see him call multiple times, but was totally ignored (maybe intentionally) by Moukandjo, who dribbled fruitlessly to the goal line, giving the ball away for a goal kick. Benny confronted Moukandjo and he responded in a very ""Hear no evil"" sort of manner. This angers the Benny.

I'm not condoning the headbutt, but it's probably anyone's natural reaction to such ignorance. 99 times out of 100, you won't see it though, you'll see it bottled up. Given the scoreline, circumstances, feeling of desperation, etc... Benny just snapped for a moment.

People in Tottenham will say The Spurs, I'm from there and I hear it all the time, but they have serious cockney accents and only say it only in certain responses. Normally to convey significance to their answer, like ""Who's going to win the game?"" ""The Spurs you idiot"". Or ""We up The Spurs tonight boys""? It's done in an almost ironic way if you will. 

However it's best if people outside Tottenham don't say it as it sounds like they don't know what they are talking about as most people call them Spurs. 

Welcome to the club by the way and I hope all this hasn't scared you off.

As to Alton Towers being taken advantage of, which is of course a possibility, I have two opinions:

a) you're fucking mental to allow 8 carers; other than Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs I cannot comprehend how anyone with a disability would require up to EIGHT carers, and that wasn't a disability, that was mental health.

I think Rodgers is a great manager, but I don't have absolute trust in his transfer dealings. Nor do I trust the rest of the ""committee"".

Benny really scuffled with QPR in the second half of the season. AVB may have opted to send him out due to attitude problems but he may have also seen Benny's ability in decline as well. Sherwood had the option to pull him back in January and still declined to recall him as well.

Even Harry came out and said that Benny isn't the player that he used to be, made a statement about how BAE was having trouble adjusting to the Championship and wasn't the same player he was several years ago.

When good ole 'Arry comes out and says you aren't as good a player as you used to be that is saying something because he was always a backer of BAE.

Benny may well and truly be past it at this point, maybe he could serve as a backup but i am not sure he would fit with Poch's system.

Almost everyone else who is worth mentioning is in a spectrum of potential.

Arsenal, aka the Gooners, aka the Scum are the worst thing that ever existed.  If Satan got a team together of the worst people in hell, I'd still root for Satan's XI over Arsenal.

Chelsea is also the living worst, due to the oligarch money that has made that team artificially a ""big club"".

The other London teams: Crystal Palace, Queens Park Rangers (QPR), and West Ham (please note Ham is short for......well, Ham) are also the worst.

If you live in Baltimore, join Baltimore Spurs - here's our facebook page:  https://www.facebook.com/groups/baltimorespurs/ (my home club)

If you live in DC, join DC Spurs: https://www.facebook.com/groups/thedcspurs/

Both clubs get together to watch the match on live TV, despite the time difference.

A bonus of joining Baltimore Spurs is the Arsenal bar in Baltimore is less that 50 feet away.  They're just as Scum as their club.

Our new manager is Mauricio Pochettino - he's been very good at a smaller club called Southampton, and stepping up to Spurs (and it's Spurs, never ""the Spurs"" unless you are singing, strangely enough) is a chance for him to him become one of the great managers if he succeeds here.  Spurs have a twitchy finger as of late with managers - we've fired quite a few lately.

The EPL is divided into ""haves"" and ""have-less-thans"":

Haves:

Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City

Have-less-thans:

everybody else

Note that Spurs are neither a have nor a have-less-than.  We are bigger than the small clubs by a significant margin, and we are also smaller than the big clubs by a significant margin.

At the end of the year, the lowest three teams are demoted (relegated) to the 2nd division, known (for historical reasons and marketing) as the Championship.  The top three teams from the Championship are promoted to the Premier League.

The top four teams in the EPL standings qualify to play in the UEFA Champions League.  Spurs aspire to be one of those teams, but we have been just short for a few years.

The winner of the Cups and the 5th place team play in the Europa League, which is not nearly as prestigious.  (There's a lot more wrinkles to qualifying for Europa, but we'll get into it later.)

There are a handful of trophies to play for:

The PL Title - the best team at the end of the season wins the title

The FA Cup - this cup is eligible to be entered by hundreds of clubs all across England

The League Cup - this cup is eligible to be entered by the 92 highest level professional teams only.  It is decidedly less prestigious than the FA Cup.

Champions League and Europa League are spliced into the regular season, and like the cups played on weeknights.

A handful of Prem games are also played on weeknights.  Also, everybody plays on 12/26 (Boxing Day) and 1/1 (New Years Day).

3 points for a win

1 point for a tie

As a spectator, what you want to see if creative, attacking play.  As a Spurs supporter, this is written into our DNA.

We call ourselves the Yids.  Tottenham was historically the Jewish neighborhood and in the face of anti-Semitism, both Jews and non-Jews took to calling themselves Yids in defiance.  As an American non-Jew, I'm uncomfortable about it.  

But really, all that matters is that you come out to watch with us (or DC Spurs).  We have fun, we sing, we chant, and if you like beer in the mornings, you can't beat it.  

Everything will come to you to get through the learning curve.  Soccer fandom is like chess: easy to learn the basics and you get better at it the more you do it.

OK so if the club doesn't have capabilities as you infer to sign all the big names, why waste time with top players? 

We're getting nowhere in terms of transfers. 

Ayre is a failure. How much ever you want to defend him, he has not brought in players of top quality. Lost more deals than he's won. 

What are these things I want? All I'm saying is if we identify a top target, we've studied him, know our finances and usually are round about the value, yet we fail. All I'm saying is get this sorted. No one expects Messi to join us. 

Ayres job is to get the players we target. He doesn't. Thus he is  a failure. Factor in what you like. The proof, ironically, is that he has no world class names to show spare a few. 

Ayre alone is not to blame, he is another Parry. The whole transfer process is to blame. It's a joke and a clusterfuck. 

He has failed to bring in prime targets. That's what he's done. The proof? We're still without any of our prime targets that we were linked with. That is proof of his failings and the transfer systems. 

I'm not denying other factors. There may be. But has Ayre got ANY players that were our first targets? It's happening now in fact with Moreno. We're being linked with Rojo and Rodriguez. What happened there? Couldn't close the deal after the hard work. Another prime target lost. 


Hicks and Gillette, my friend, saddled the club with debt. Go over the history and see that you're talking nonsense if you think the club went bankrupt under the cowboys because of transfers. In fact a major failure of theirs was that they didn't commit money to transfers and that led us to missing top targets Rafa had marked.

Of course I've seen him play. The dude runs all day but he has no end product. In his position that's frankly pathetic. 

The fact that you're saying you'd pay 40 for him shows you're not approaching this in a reasonable way.

Instead he plays on a team where if he doesn't do well it doesn't matter because they sign guys for 30 all the time. 


I'm not someone who is going to fall over about statistics. They can make a bad player look good and a good player look bad. But the length of a player's career doesn't lie. Stewart Downing had one good season and we overpaid for him. Willian has barely had that in his time in inferior leagues.

The rationale being that 32 squads of players come together and hope that somehow they will have the chemistry needed to win, when in actuality the majority of them never play alongside each other during the club season. Spain's fallout this tournament might be the best example for that. Despite all that quality, it just didn't come together in time.

Well these guys don't all just show up at the WC not knowing each other. Most of them have been playing together in the same league and if not they would have been together at multiple international breaks over the last 4 years. The chemistry is always there but the execution might not be. Spain's problems this WC have absolutely nothing to do with chemistry, almost all their players have known each other and won things with each other for years.

Best is clearly an opinionated word, however this specific opinion is shared by millions around the world. If you disagree so be it. But what I  believe should be undisputed is the fact that our players continuing deeper in the tournament is much more beneficial than getting to head to the beach early.
