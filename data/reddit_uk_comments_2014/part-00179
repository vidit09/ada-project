A lot of my friends who are graduating this year have jobs with starting salaries £35-£40k in the private sector in defence or finance, so even with the bursary entitlement in your first year, you sit well below the salary of your peers.

The other thing is, people who are very passionate about Maths and Physics go onto further study, moreso than in something like English for example.

    YQ  	GBP 60.00

    Customs User Fee - USA  	GBP3.30

That's almost £200 in taxes charged by UK authorities, and only a very small amount (by comparison) charged by their counterpart US authorities.  Although, yes, if you had to apply for an ESTA, you'd pay an additional ~£8.

You're using the term to mean the freedom of speech which people enjoy in the UK as opposed to the *concept* of 'free speech', which is as I quoted above provides for the freedom to express *any* opinion without restraint.

You have a few hundred unaccountable people negotiating this, most of them from the corporate sphere, undemocratic, nontransparent... then it will be adopted and it will take a lot of time for the rest of us to go through it and see exactly what it is doing. It will be adopted before there is time for democratic scrutiny. Once adopted there will be legal restrictions on if it is possible to change it, it will probably be impossible to change it without long legal disputes and millions of pounds of legal fees, the corporations always have the best lawyers and the deepest pockets. Most people will never know about the TPP and even fewer will know exactly what it is doing even though it will effect their lives - this is morally unjustifiable.

true,Chrisischan,flair8,,"From what history? Playing under us and at Fulham, where he did indeed mostly play as a CAM but he's struggled to maintain the form that saw him a consistent contributor for a top German side? He can certainly fill in at the No 10 slot, but I do think given his strengths and weaknesses he's better more reserved. That applies to both a reserved CAM type or a DLP, but given our possession of Eriksen it's useful to not only supply Eriksen with vertical passes into quickly supplied space as well as maximize the strengths of Holtby. Schalke under Magath actually tried him out at the DLP position, and it's been argued by this article included that Holtby actually fared better at the time than a player currently headed for Barcelona: http://www.thefalse9.com/2012/01/resurgence-of-deep-lying-playmaker-part_13.html?m=1

That one heat map follows a trend, as I specifically mentioned in the post to which you replied. Look at other maps from Holtby, you'll note he's all over the place. He does not have the heat map of a genuine CAM sitting to receive the ball and supply attack, as we need, but one of a true CM who can pick up the ball from deep and move it forward to become involved in attack. 

He doesn't have to be of the ilk of Modric or Pirlo to be a DLP, as those players are not the specific description of the position. I would indeed like to see Holtby develop in the long ball category of his game, but he very much fills the description of the role in picking up the the ball from deep and movin in vertically to supply the players in attack positions. His look for the throughball is superb, which allows him to survive in the CAM position but because of his lack in tight space dribbling ability it is more conducive to the demands of a DLP.

We know Coke and Reebok and Primark and.... so many more... are scumbag companies. But we buy their shit anyway. 

The point I'm trying to get to is this: It's not their choice, it's not ""willingness"" it's imposed on them by the nations who buy the goods they make, and by the corporations who profit by them. We should start being more honest about it. If we cared they'd be out of business or forced to change their business practices, but when push comes to shove we've decided access to £3 t-shirts is more important than the suffering of the people who make them.

&gt;__Received Pronunciation__ (__RP__) is regarded as the standard [accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accent_(dialect\)) of [Standard English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_English) in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom), with a relationship to regional accents similar to the relationship in other European languages between their standard varieties and their regional forms.  RP is defined in the *[Concise Oxford English Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concise_Oxford_English_Dictionary)* as ""the standard accent of English as spoken in the [south of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_of_England)"",  although it can be heard from native speakers throughout England and Wales.   [Peter Trudgill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Trudgill) estimated in 1974 that 3% of people in Britain were RP speakers.

Nothing is going to change the fact that the building is on fire and the people want out. However much we may wish they could just take the lift like fortunate you and me whose building is not on fire, there is simply no way they can get out safely and comfortably. Boycotting or baning the sale of products made with cheap third world labour amounts to barring the windows of the building so the people inside it aren't forced/allowed to make such a terrible choice.

We should be helping those who want to leave the burning building through the window, giving them makeshift parachutes, ropes, or using inflatable landing thingies and whatever it takes because, believe me, they are going to jump anyway. It is dangerous, terrifying, and maybe some will die and be injured. Hopefully we can use special resources, like helicopters, to get the kids out, but helicopters are slow and scarce and you can be sure many kids will prefer to take the dangerous adult exits instead of waiting.

But still, while the evacuation is going on, many people in other non-burning towers will still be disgusted that people should be forced/allowed to leave a skyscraper in such an awful and risky way, while being completely oblivious to the fact that the building they are escaping is on fire, how terrible fire actually is, or to the fact that when there is a fire like that you simply cannot take the stairs or the lift. Some will call for this subhuman and dangerous evacuation to be halted. After all, people should not be forced to jump out of their tower if we are not willing to jump out of ours. And if their protests succeed, the tower will still be on fire with everyone in it, burning to death.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;You can tell that these critics of faith schools didn’t attend one, for if they had they would know that far from being production lines of little God-lovers, they’re often hotbeds of blasphemy and dissent. 

I think the author is too focused on his own singular experience of attending a moderate faith school, and relying on it to inform his opinion on faith schools in general.

The school he attended was probably filled with middle class children who were only there because their parents made them go to church so they could get into the good local CoE school. They have the option of being sceptical, because their environment allows for scepticism. 

I'm sure the school he attended didn't force girls to wear headscarves, or only allow them to eat certain foods. I'm sure there weren't speakers at his school telling him that homosexuals should be murdered, and even if there were, I'm sure his parents at teachers would have been disgusted by such thoughts, not agree with them. Religion probably played a very small part of school life where he attended, maybe Mass once a week, a prayer at morning assembly and a couple of hours of RE a week. It probably didn't play a central role in everything he did at school. 

In such an environment, where religion isn't just an optional add on to your life, but a daily obligation, enforced by your parents and teachers at all times, it is much more difficult, perhaps almost impossible to be sceptical.

Audio still survives and you can listen to all of them with slideshows of surviving footage &amp; pictures. Additionally,  a few have been animated and released of DVD. Namely, The Reign of Terror, The Tenth Planet, The Moonbase, The Ice Warriors, and The Invasion. Also, The Underwater Menace is in the works. Mission to the Unknown was made as a test, and is available online. Unfortunately no others are planned as it is currently no financial plausible for them to animated serials missing three or more episodes. Hopefully, that could change in the future as that is what they said after making The Invasion. 

As for the reconstructions (audio with slideshows and clips) I personally found them to be way less enjoyable and memorable without the visual, especially Troughton's, who was a very physical Doctor, in the same vein as Smith. I only watched a few missing episodes, most of which ended up being animated. The only one that I do highly recommend is actually the one missing the most, The Daleks Master Plan. The staggering 12 (technically 13) part series only has 3 full episodes not missing. Mission to the Unknown is the lead in, which is separate for the rest of it.

true,JohnHC86,null,null,"First, there are lots of hills between the 3 cities you mentioned. I like hills. Hills make for good cycling.

Bradford is actually quite nice, has a diverse and vibrant community and is connected to Leeds, York, Manchester by train. However, the job market there is very competitive.

Leeds has better job prospects but is more expensive. There is plenty of culture and nightlife there, so it attracts those with a bit more disposable income. You will be fighting uni students for the jobs.

Manchester is a sprawling mess of good and bad areas. There are trams that you can use to get around when you don't fancy the bike. The cost of liing varies from area to area. There are pockets of minority communities in Manchester, but they get along better than in Bradford.

I would also recommend looking at Sheffield. The city is on the up with a rapidly improving job market, it is very diverse and has lots of nightlife, plenty of culture. Old fashioned values still hold strong (community is important). The city is built on a hill, surrounded by valleys, with hills all around. There are more hills than you can shake a stick at (because that's a public order offense so no stick-shaking). Rent is cheap, £250 would be ample in most areas (bar the city centre) and £150/m of entertainment expenses would be  enough to go out at about once a week.

Wherever you go, I'd recommend you have enough cash to survive 3 months without the social aspect (so rent, food and an emergency slush fund). If you completed high school, work shouldn't be too much of an issue.

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"The problem, as I see it, is that social media/internet is still very new and society at large hasn't really figured out just how different it is from normal communication and how that difference changes the game. 

Yes, people are cunts online but it's not the anonymity. People are cunts with their name and photo attached to the message, Facebook proves that. 

It's the disconnect, I'm sitting here typing my thoughts into a white box in my pants, alone. I have no real sense of any human being who is going to read it, I can't pick up on your distaste as I type, I'm not going to feel your reactions when I'm done. Any other comments or anyone who replies has done more or less the same, time shifted and further disconnected. 

You, reading this, don't see me as I say it. You see a made up name amongst many, we're not having a conversation, you aren't sharing a room with anyone. You're just seeing a snippet of a book that's constantly being written by a random collection of made up names.

If I want to affect your emotions I'm going to have to try hard to leap out of this white box, I can't shout, I can't cry, I can't stare at you to let you know how serious I am. I *can* use stronger words, more disgusting insults, more personal insults and so on. 

So that's what people do. 'Offensiveness' it ratchetted up 10 clicks just to get some kind of visceral reaction. We probably shouldn't be reacting to that 10+ level, we should automatically assume a fairly minor insult has been amplified because of the medium.. but we don't. 

-----

My personal grand theory is that online communication reveals a more true face of humanity. I think before we had all this people *had* to moderate their real views because of the emotive pressure of personal interaction. With a lot of that lifted people can say what they want and it turns out.. people are cunts. They are also awesome though, and sad, some of them are really weird. 

We need to stop applying the rules of the old world to the new. It's not the same. It's not just a 'better telephone'.

Point taken. It was 2 in the morning and I missed the name. Don't you think the previous poster is capable of defending himself?

&gt; What, by bringing up random cases of police misconduct?

It isn't remotely random. It is a very clear example of the extremes that police will go to in order to spy on protesters, and illustrates some of the serious consequences that such spying can have. I am glad that you agree that at least in some cases police spying is misconduct.

&gt; I would assume the reasons were mass trespass, not party politics.

Mass trespass is pretty hard to hide. If it occurs, then police can deal with it when it happens. Even if mass trespass occurs, it's hardly the end of the world. It's not like mass trespass kills or seriously harms people in the same way as many other crimes.

&gt; You have no idea what intelligence methods were used in this case, as none were revealed. The fact human intelligence operations are carried out elsewhere does not mean they are the only form of intelligence used, there could have been multiple things done to gather intelligence.

I'd have no objections to police reading public websites. People organising large scale protests very seldom do so in complete secrecy, since that defeats the entire point of these protests !

&gt; You have no idea what intelligence methods were used in this case

Did you read the original article, where it was claimed that:

&gt;  they are understood to include undercover “covert human intelligence sources” and “electronic interception”. 

If the police want to correct that understanding, and to state categorically that no spys and electronic evesdropping were used, then they are welcome.

&gt; It isn't remotely random. It is a very clear example of the extremes that police will go to in order to spy on protesters

So you are saying they infiltrated a fracking protest over 7 years and fucked them all while trying to get them to do jail-able things. Because if not *then its not fucking relevant* to a small *single* protest and some probably pretty routine and quickly arranged surveillance of it.

&gt; Mass trespass is pretty hard to hide.

Yeah, they will have talked about it online, forums, facebook, and they would have known what to expect and what scale of a response to bring.

&gt; Even if mass trespass occurs

You have totally slid the conversation from your original ""enforce the law impartially"" to ""why are they enforcing the law here, its not even that bad?"" Whining about Kennedy doesn't change the facts this is a police matter.

&gt; Did you read the original article, where it was claimed that:

Yes. I've read better articles too which didn't pardon the police institution so heavily in favour of blaming Kennedy for everything like the Mail did there.

Actually, you insulted anyone that didn't agree with your definition by asserting that they were 'downvoting facts', when they're nothing of the sort. And he reacted to your lazy reply upon which you took offence instead of pulling up actual facts (which speaks volumes).

&gt;and subsequently again by calling me a twat after I retaliated.

Because you *then* came up with gems like 'eloquent bleat of the devoted monarchist' (what?), followed with 'Enjoy your subservience, wierdo'. Aside from 'wierdo' meaning someone that doesn't follow the majority (which in this case would actually mean *you*), it's then laughable that you get upset about being insulted, when you're quite happy to do the same *and then pretend you haven't*.

&gt;The reality is that anyone here who doesn't have their tongue stuck firmly up the Royal Family's collective arsehole is downvoted to oblivion

Sure, that *must* be it. Or maybe, *just maybe*, people don't react well to being blanket-insulted in advance on the assumption that there can be no other outcome if they don't agree with *you*. Considering that's how you summarise your 'reality', you might want to tone down the tar-everyone-with-what-you-want-to-be-true polarisation.

&gt;I couldn't give a toss about trying to persuade people who support the monarchy

You don't, apparently, give a toss about defending (or even explaining) your own opinions either.

&gt;especially if it involves interacting with hypocritical bell-ends like yourself - throwing insults out yet complaining of a lack of civilised discourse.

I think you're winning in the insults-instead-of-providing-a-real-argument stakes. By quite a margin. Plus, you've also come across as far more hypocritical. So far.

&gt;The fact is it is inherent in the system, whether you like it or not.

I asked you why/ how that is earlier, and you haven't answered.

&gt;Evidently you don't, but so what? It's still true. 

That's three times.

&gt;Maybe you're too much of a twat to realise your own stance is illogical.

You haven't actually shown how that is yet either - and in any case, he's not suggesting a huge section of the population are subservient in some way, you are - so it's for you to show how you know this, not him to show you how you're right and the majority are wrong. So, do elaborate.

I have queued once for Wimbledon where I camped in the nearby park for 2 nights in order to get centre court tickets for mens quarter finals day. When you get to the park, you get a 'queue ticket' which guarantees your place in the queue for that day. The next day you can either use that queue ticket to get in line for tickets that day or get a new queue ticket if your staying another night. The different types of tickets are the 3 (or maybe 4?) show courts and then ground passes. There are limited numbers for each.

If your staying overnight again, you're issued a new queue pass with a different number and it means you're now further in front of the queue as some people have gone in to the grounds that day. You also have to move your tent and keep it in line depending on your queue number. 

All that being done, the day you finally decide to cash in your queue ticket, you pack up your tent and line up ridiculously early. Stewards come down the line and exchange your queue pass for a wristband depending on what type of ticket you want i.e. Centre Court, Court One etc. Once a certain wristband runs out, thats it, tickets for that court are up for the day.

All the people that come early on the same day to get into Wimbledon join the back of the queue of the people that have camped out.

true,SMTRodent,eng-nottinghamshire,Back in Nottnum,"You had bad luck. You had parents that didn't teach you, day by day, year by year, how to look after yourself by doing it for you then letting you take over until you were a healthy, capable adult. That's a real shame. But now you're an adult and the parenting is all on you.

An adult still needs to get enough sleep, decent meals, to go out, to be cherished, to avoid danger, to be entertained, to learn. Now you're an adult, and you've got to do these things yourself. Set your own bedtime, sort out decent meals, make yourself eat your vegetables, get yourself outside and doing something healthy, praise yourself for doing well and teach yourself how to learn from mistakes. Otherwise you'll feel lonely, miserable, anxious and generally crap because you're deprived and neglected. 

Your mentor is you: you make decisions that affect your future self, and whether your future self is a content, well fed, well rested healthy adult who feels cherished, or a miserable, tired, anxious and lonely person with nobody to care about them is actually down to how well you care for that person you're going to become - not in some abstract time frame, but by tomorrow morning. Do you wake up well fed and knowing what's for breakfast, or do you wake up tired and not knowing when and what your next meal will be?

You are going to either decide when you turn off your computer, or just sit there doing nothing much until you're exhausted. You're going to decide whether you're climbing into a well made bed or a pile of duvet. You're going to decide whether you eat junk for your next meal. And if you're doing these things, you're going to give yourself credit, by acknowledging it, just like your parents should have done for you every day but didn't.

In two years you're going to be in (or looking for) a job you care about, in a place you've researched as a good place to live. Or you'll be starting a degree you really care about, as a mature student making a fresh start, in a university you like. Or you're going to be drifting along in the same mess you are now, waiting for a kind rescuer who will never, ever come. Your future self needs help, and your present self is the only person who is in a position to actually help them.

Today you acknowledge that you are your own caretaker and you step up to your responsibility for this adult person who needs help to get to a good place in two years time. Your parents had their chance at looking after you and blew it, so now it's on you. Thankfully, you're bright and capable of learning, you're not a drug addict, a parent, an acoholic or a gambler, you are both literate and articulate and you have internet access. You're several steps up on where you could be, and you have the tools to get to the next level.

Completely besides the point greased piggy! If you're **not** saying it has anything to do with this fracking protest, then why bring it up?

""POLICE DO BAD THINGS, SO THEY DID BAD THINGS AT THIS PROTEST!""

Its not logic, its stupidity, and its shrill, you're shrill, and stupid. 

&gt; I never said that the law should not be enforced. I am simply making the point that police resources should be concentrated on crimes according to their severity not according to political considerations.

Mass trespass is a crime, and a police matter as they're not going to leave, and an appropriate *scale* of reaction is required by law, from the police. You say any form of surveillance here whatsoever is wrong, i say its necessary to apply appropriate force.

I will not try hard to respond to what you wrote if what you wrote is sliding the original point onto some circlejerk you want to engage in which is besides the main point. I will try hard to keep you on point. I dont care about Kennedy, or any historic cases which show over-aggressive and unethical police behaviour. I care about one news story. I know, i know, you're on a crusade, but im not, please respect that.

Except its only a fallacy if its the only part of a response, like ""you're wrong because you're dumb"", whereas im saying ""you're wrong because A, B and C and thats oversimplifying things cuz ur retarded"". Try not to jump on the fallacyjerk.

Usually people don't queue so nicely as in the UK so there's often some ambiguity about who would be entitled to be served next. So everyone's kind of playing this secret game to get in the best position to get served next but without being to obvious. However, there's usually a limit to this. E.g. there might four people in the top position to get served next but more people behind it. It wouldn't be okay to jump this queue and take one of the top positions immediately, however, if you earned your top position through queuing at least for a while (you're allowed to push a bit), then it's also okay to get served next even though other people might have been queuing for longer.
It's a bit like in football. All player act a bit when they get fouled to make it look worse but there's a limit to it.
If you out someone for jumping the queue you're basically saying ""We all cheat a bit here, but you really went way too far"" and because it's in general quite uncommon to speak to other people in public,this makes it even a bigger thing.

The government's reasoning for khat ban is 100% wrong. It's likely that they may have an agenda on this issue seeing they've ignored expert opinions stating that khat shouldn't banned and have gone against majority of people views on this issue.

This ban will definitely create a black market which leads a lot more people getting arrested for it. Most of them will be either Somali or Yemeni. Remember that as next time you see a statistic stating that higher proportion of Somalis/Yemenis being in prison than white British, you will know why.

However, personally I believe this drug should be taxed heavily. Even more than cigarette and other drugs as this to prevent poor people using it (yes I know it won't prevent them but it'll reduce it). Most people know how harmless is this drug. However most people fail to consider the societal effects this drug causes. This drug has single-handedly caused majority of divorces in Somali/Yemeni communities. This is also the reason why it's common to see unemployed Somali/Yemeni people in café chatting all day everyday.  Most Somali women (and young people) are against this drug, they will gladly ban it. In fact that there are some rumours flouting around that Somali woman in Somali government (and another government in Somaliland) is planning to propose a bill banning this drug.

No it damn well does not and I genuinely have no idea where this belief comes from.

A Not Proven verdict is, legally, no different whatsoever from a Not Guilty verdict. The Not Proven verdict may well often used by jurists and jurors to suggest that they do not believe that the accused is wholly innocent but that the Crown did not make its case beyond a reasonable doubt (for example, where a defence is offered that appears ludicrous and unlikely but not impossible for which the Crown presents no evidence to contradict it or challenge it) but it has never meant that someone could be re-tried at a later date simply because the verdict was Not Proven. A Not Proven verdict has always been an absolute discharge.

As it happens, someone who receives a Not Proven verdict in a serious matter can be re-tried if the Crown can present what is considered to constitute compelling new evidence but this is as a result of the scrapping of the Double Jeopardy rule, and it equally applies to Not Guilty verdicts, not because a Not Proven verdict specifically allowed for it.

There was a very interesting 4Chan post I saw recently on this. A user recalls being on the internet in around year 2000, when his parents warned him to never give out his name, personal information, address etc. online. Now his entire family has a Facebook profile where they upload *everything* they can about themselves and not doing so suggests you are asocial / have something to hide.

The 'Facebook Generation' will do all of the normal (and often stupid) things that all generations do when they are young, but for the first time it will be immortalized online. 25 years ago not much social interaction was recorded, now everything on Facebook / Twitter / email is recorded by someone. It will be probably be fascinating for people in 2120 to be able to see their great-great-grandfather neck-nominating, flirting or abusing people online. For quite a lot of people I think there might be some regret and an attempt to cover up their mean / cringey activities.

UKIP do not hold many official policies - they have disavowed themselves of their old (2010?) manifesto, and their manifesto for the recent European elections held only a single policy, to get us out of Europe. [""Oh, and bringing back grammar schools, you can have that""](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/25/nigel-farage-ukip-european-parliament-elections)

Farage announced this week [a position over direct democracy and referendums](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27973093), but I'm not sure if that's a policy promise. He's also recently [dismissed UKIP's previous advocacy of a flat tax, and talked of setting a top tax rate of 40%.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27654958)

As far as I'm aware, that's the most official summary of UKIP's policies that you'll get - apart from what's ""obvious"" and ""common sense"", of course.

UKIP like to maintain as wide appeal an appeal as possible, so they try not to make statements which will disillusion any of their existing voters. 

UKIP allow their supporters to project their own opinions on the party, so if anyone tells you ""this is what UKIP would do"", ask them for a link to where it says that in UKIP's manifesto or press releases, or Farage's words himself. Their councillors say all sorts of things and so, to a lesser extend, do their MEPs, but these are not promises the party will stand by. 

In the same thread on immigration, I've seen one UKIP advocate talk about a ""points based system"", and another talk about allowing Irish immigrants because ""they're culturally British"". UKIP advocates can contradict each other and still be right! They can say what they like, because there's no full and official policy.

I might guess that some lower-level UKIP members might say ""it's obvious and common sense that we shouldn't allow islamic terrorists in our country"", but I doubt Farage will weigh in on the subject.

I argued with them quite a bit, they claimed it was perfectly legal, I pointed to the Office of Fair Trading ruling that the analogous credit card fees were illegal and the large amount of people contesting the fees in court. 

In your situation: they will (correctly) argue that you knew about the foreign transaction fee and the unauthorised overdraft fees as it's in the info about the account. Point out that:

* they're trying to charge you the equivalent of 100,000% APR
* you checked your balance as soon as you were able, but that their mistakes slowed you down

Honestly, I'd recommend saying you'll sue in small claims court, but check the account conditions first. I doubt they'd fight hard against an £80 fee, and if you're clear that you're not backing down they might give in. If not, small claims court is very much your best bet, IMO.

Look, I'm going to be totally honest with you: you're making a lot of excuses for spending an extra few quid here and there every month *but it all adds up*. You want help to control your spending? You have to consider every single pound you can save. You need to shop around for suppliers (you may be tied in to BT for 18 months by now, though). You've already said you're living paycheck to paycheck. Believe me, I've done that in the past. For a long time. The only way to get things under control is to think about every single penny which leaves your account. *Every. Single. Penny.* That £3/month? That's very nearly the cost of that train ticket you want over the course of a year. For what? A saving of a couple of minutes on a 1GB file? Do you spend a lot of time sitting idle waiting for stuff to download?

You've said below you like MMOs. That's fine. But can you save the money you spend on EVE? Do you have to spend that extra £16/month (£192/year, or a quarter of your trip to Seattle)? Can you play free games instead? Can you take advantage of your fast broadband to set up your own Minecraft server, for example? Can you use your time and skills to *write* your own MMO?

Your League of Legends skins at £30/month is £360/year, very nearly half your trip to Seattle. Your clothing allowance of £50/month is £600/year, or 3/4 your trip to Seattle. £50/month seems a lot. £150/year should be plenty. Charity and cheap shops are not a bad thing. Seriously. No-one will ever know what you bought full price from a designer and what you got for a pound from the Red Cross shop. Some of my best jumpers were from Primark. Lasted years, too.

Thing is, making changes is really scary. I know that. You feel like all the things you've tried have failed, and anything else you try is going to be hard and probably fail as well. You know what? That's not true. You're already a success: you're self-taught in an incredibly competitive field! You're earning great for someone in a first job! Your prospects from here will only ever improve! You've got a great life ahead of you - and it stretches out for years and years ahead of you, too, to make of it whatever you want - if you take a couple of risks and *try*. Try *hard*.

You need to do these things (and they're said with love, honestly, I know what you're going through: I have a history of depression, and loneliness, and being broke, and I got through it with a little tough love!):

- accept that you need to work hard. Very hard. You need to work hard to save money and you need to work hard to be happy. Both are totally worth it.
- Go back to your doctor (see a different one) to talk about how you feel. If they're no good, ask if they can signpost you to local help. If you're on your first job you're probably under 25 so there are almost certainly services which can help you with what sounds like social anxiety and maybe depression. The good news? You can get through these and you can build a wonderful social life and be having a great time in 12 months or less. The bad news? You have to *work at it*. If you see a counsellor, therapist or advisor you must do the homework they set. There is only one magic bullet cure: that's hard work.
- Set aside a day to really look at your finances. Download your bank statements and categorise all your spending into what bills, what discretionary spending, what rent you pay, to the penny. As far as possible you need to know everything you spend on. EVERYTHING.
- Now - and you're in the idea position if you're moving - *find cheaper alternatives*. Shop around. A day spent shopping around for utility providers could potentially save you hundreds. It's a dull job, but it's totally worth it. Look out for vouchers and other sweeteners people might offer you. Almost everything you buy - everything! - is probably available cheaper if you shop around for it.
- Stop making excuses about food. Your stove - if it gets hot - is not crap. Look at this beautiful bugger! http://realfood.tesco.com/recipes/smokey-pulled-pork-stew-with-beans-peppers-and-orange-gremolata.html - a pork shoulder (which can be a lot cheaper than at Tesco) is enough meat to feed an army for a few quid *and it tastes like it's just fallen from heaven*. This is an incredible thing to make and freeze and it's half the price of anything you can buy read-made, if not cheaper. My soon-wife makes something like this and we get eight meals for about £8-10 total (including rice) and it's awesome beyond words. Takeaway pizza? You can make your own for a quarter of the cost amazingly easily and quickly: http://www.samspotatoes.ie/recipes/recipe-database/paul-hollywoods-pizza.html (ignore the toppings bit there, it's the dough you care about). Plus it's fun and impresses the ladies beyond belief (especially if you can throw the dough). And you get to have exactly the toppings you want how you want them and it's so much healthier. You certainly don't need a ""good"" oven for this: whack it up full, wait for it to heat up, shove the pizza in for 15 minutes, job done. Can't be bothered to cook? Yeah. No excuses. Get up and do it. You'll get 5 minutes in and forget that you couldn't be bothered and you'll be enjoying it. You know what some runners do? They sleep in their running kit, so the next morning they get up and think ""well I'm already dressed for it, I may as well do 1k, I can always turn around"". Then by the time they get to 1k they think ""well I'm out here now I may as well finish"". Then by 10k they love the crap out of that run. We all have to do crap we can't be arsed with, every damn day, and the hardest part is actually starting it. So start it. No excuses.
- Make your own lunch. Get into a routine. Suck. It. Up. Can't be bothered? Why not do all that not being bothered with a slice of ham in your hand? It's 10 minutes a day, if that. Is that £70 a week? Christ, even if it's £70/month you can do this so, so much cheaper. At £70/month that's Seattle paid for in a year. At £70/week that's nearly £4k a year!
- Be strict. Really strict. Set yourself a cash budget each month. Take out that cash on pay day then put your debit card away somewhere. Remove your card details from any online one-click buy services. Wrap your card in a picture of Seattle. Now live on that cash. Got some left over at the end of the month? Well, it's up to you - you can treat yourself or you can put it in a jar. Running out? Then you have to tighten your belt. Think about every purchase. Really think about it. If you want something, wait until the end of the month to buy it. Did you make it to the end of the month without buying it? Then you didn't really want it that much, did you? You can live fine without it. And every time you start to run out of money or think you can treat yourself this one time and you go to get your card out, look at that picture of Seattle and remind yourself that you're pushing it back by another month.
- Every damn pound matters when you live paycheck to paycheck. Even when you don't. You know how rich people are notoriously tight about stuff? How they'll walk over broken glass to pick up that pound they just dropped? *That's why they're rich*.
- Don't get in debt to tide you over. There's no need at all. You'll stay there, too. Believe me. That couple of hundred arranged overdraft to keep you going is the worst thing that ever happened to you 10 years later when it's maxed out every month and you never quite put aside enough to pay it back.... been there, done that. Thousands of pounds in fees, burnt away to nothing.
- Be beyond anal about money. You have to know where every penny is. Not assume - not guess - *know*. All that stuff about your rent and deposit? *You will sort this out RIGHT NOW*. You will know EXACTLY what the situation is, what your landlord is expecting, what you can expect back, what work you need to do to make your current place pass that inspection, and you will know all this BY THE END OF THE DAY. OK? You will not allow any more surprises with money.

It is your responsibility to ensure you operate your account so as to not go overdrawn.

Read the T&amp;C.

So you knew there was nothing in it.

So if you need to do that you do it.

You were told what they were when you opened the account. 

&gt; I had no practical way of knowing that this was happening.

Other than reading the terms and conditions which are available on the website, going into the bank to check, neither of which you did.

The NSA aren't allowed to look at American's data without warrants etc.

So GCHQ stores all the UK data, and the NSA ""spies"" on it, in agreement with GCHQ. The NSA stores all the USA data, and GCHQ ""spies"" on it in agreement with the NSA.

GCHQ tells the NSA what the data about Americans says, and the NSA tells GCHQ what the data about the British says.

So legally, GCHQ hasn't looked at anything British, and the NSA hasn't looked at anything American. But both sides tell the other side so that they still know everything they need to.

He made an excellent ship charterer and trader, but a measely soldier. That is the problem that would come with pressing inmates into the military.

As I see it, they could be made to build machine parts, stitch clothing or serve as gardeners. Some we do already, whlist others are what other nations try. A large portion of the helmets and vests used by the US military are made by the prison population, and those are transferable skills, whereas getting shit from a sergeant major whilst only being allowed to perform the tedious duties of resupplying depots or cleaning the laundry, is only going to make them spiteful.

true,HannibalAntePortas,null,null,"From the article you cited:
&gt;""Lewis Holtby, who just returned from Mainz following a tremendous season playing as a winger or in behind the striker. Once again the manager, this time Ralf Rangnick who took over after Felix Magath was sacked mid way into the second half of the season, saw the passing ability of Holtby and decided to try out the youngster in a deeper position in order to have a better technical presence since Raul’s performances of last season saw merit in him keeping his position in the first team in Holtby’s more natural position. While not being nearly as good as he was last season. Holtby’s performances have been better than that of Rakitic and therefore present a bit of hope for Schalke that their search for the prefect deep playmaker might end here.""

In summation, Holtby had a tremendous season playing at Mainz where he mostly featured in behind the forward and sometimes as a winger. Despite this, Holtby was pushed into playing deeper for Schalke where his performances were not nearly as good because Raul was playing in Holtby's more natural role in behind the striker. That is what the article you cited says. How you can use the findings of this article as a justification for making your point is beyond me. Sure, it mentions that Holtby played slightly better than Rakitic in a deeper role for Schalke, but believe me that wasn't hard to do. As the article states the result of playing Rakitic deeper was a ""complete catastrophe for the Royal Blues who lost their first four matches conceding nine goals."" Holtby fared slightly better than ""complete catastrophe."" Wow! As history suggests, Holtby didn't do so hot there either as Schalke would return to their preferred and much more successful system of playing 2 defensive minded mids with a CAM farther up. 

As for Holtby's heat maps, there are a few obvious reasons for his being all over the place. As I mentioned before, Schalke, when playing Holtby as the #10, fielded a defensive minded midfield pairing behind him. They provided Schalke with the grit and backbone necessary to free Holtby up. Almost every time the ball was won back, those players sought out Holtby with the ball. From there Holtby kick started things by either playing a ball into the forward or by playing a ball out wide to Schalke's pacey wingers. His job was to be all over the place because once Schalke won the ball back, they were built to seek out their most creative player. It totally suited Schalke's style of play and it totally suited Holtby's energetic and creative play. It's the hallmark of a more counter-attacking side. In that role he had his most successful season by chipping in with a few goals and providing several assists which if you watched that Schalke side, you'd know that he easily could have had more if it weren't for the wastefulness of Huntelaar.

I should probably start my own thread, but seeing as you've mentioned Nutmeg being expensive I figure I'll ask here: What would you consider the next step once a person has no debt, spends within budget, a healthy emergency cash reserve, is matching their employer's pension contributions and is maxing their ISA buying Vanguard?

The next part of that/my plan would be to put ~£50 a month in to nutmeg's riskiest of offerings, because to me the rebalancing they do seems worth it over the costs of a dedicated fund manager and there's plenty of ""safer"" money already being saved. I like the hands off approach they facilitate, as I would obsess over my choices and the markets if I were to pick and choose myself - and likely do badly. The nutmeg money would have no defined purpose (while everything else is earmarked for emergencies and retirement) If it does well it could be for indulgences, maybe even a buy to let property eventually. If it doesn't, then that's a bitch but the ISA was already maxed so where else would it have gone?

The only other place that springs to mind would be increasing pension contributions to benefit from higher to basic tax relief in old age, but I need to educate myself further on early access/taxation/rules on pension income... Not that it matters, it will be all change when I'm looking to retire - I don't trust pensions given the gov can move the goalposts whenever they see fit. Do their powers extend over private pension withdrawals too? Sure, changing the ISA allowance has annoying repercussions, but waking up one day and being told I need to work another x years because my birthday is the wrong side of the line? Fuck that.

Probabilities of people subscribing to certain views are higher in some cultures/religions but that doesn't inform as to individuals' beliefs. Generalisations don't help in deciding who is ""bad"" or ""good""; only actions. That doesn't imply that followers of Islam or people from Asian cultures are shielded from criticism - indeed, certain [forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_feminism) of [bullying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_in_Islam) may be more prevalent - it's just that painting *all* members of a cultural background or religion as being more inclined to think a certain way seems *unfair* to the person of suspect.

http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/may/10/coulson-cameron-asked-phone-hacking

Cameron was very aware of Coulson's history :

By the time Coulson entered Downing Street in May 2010, the Guardian had run more than 90 articles about illegal activities at the News of the World under his editorship,... Cameron had been warned by a number of political colleagues against hiring him as the No 10 press secretary.

Unlike anyone else in the post, Coulson was not properly vetted, despite having access to top secret material.  That vetting would have blocked his appointment.

Coulson also told the inquiry that he had unsupervised access to papers marked ""top secret"" and attended meetings of the national security council even though he had only been through basic security vetting. Unsupervised access to top secret material requires the higher ""developed vetting"" level of clearance held by most of Coulson's predecessors. 


[Paddy Ashdown, Nick Clegg, and The Guardian all warned Cameron directly not to employ Coulson, based on evidence that was not public, but was provably true.](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/09/phone-hacking-andy-coulson-paddy-ashdown) 

Cameron hired someone who he knew to be involved in illegal hacking,  he was warned by multiple credible sources, and chose to not security vet him in breach of protocol.

 With regards to your second point I have to agree that in the last 40 years the amount of people smoking has dropped dramatically (from about 45% across both genders and all age groups to just over 20%) and this can be attributed to awareness of the harms of tobacco, constant price increase and the social stigma that has developed surrounding smoking amongst other things. However amongst the younger generation (18-25) smoking is still very popular with about 30% of that age bracket smoking and in my opinion that number has plateaued and without any further reform I can't see that number dropping.

 In terms of your reference to the Volstead Act I'd have to say these two are very different in some key points, firstly apart from those smoking who are 17 years old and younger when this law (if it does) comes into effect it will not be forcing those who already smoke to stop cold turkey. Secondly only about 20% of the population smokes compared to about 80% who drink. And thirdly smoking is far removed from drinking as a ‘drug’, only those who do not smoking regularly actually feel noticeable effects whilst smoking and that would only be the first one or two, those who do smoke daily barely feel any effect and are mostly just feeding an addiction.

Anyway, I think this is a very complicated issue and at the end of the day is a balancing act between personal freedom of choice and the greater public good.

Also, nobody should go to Stechford Cascades ever. When they hold classes, they let parents bring pushchairs right up to the poolside which means muck from outside gets tracked in and there's always a thin film of dirt on top of the water. Barf.

I personally love my speakers (http://bit.ly/1pJPASl) Roth is a british brand which I thought was a bonus, the wireless sub woofer is really useful and you can connect your phone to the speaker via Bluetooth which means less wires. The only downside is that it is a soundbar not individual speakers for me this is not a problem as I'm not fussed by surround sound but if you are they may not be the product for you.

This is a bit below your budget so you could get a slightly bigger TV or an extra PS4 game. Hope this helps.

That causes more hassle than it's worth. Not only do you lose cash trying to negotiate such a swap but unless there is a pre-existing system established you've got a large loss on one store and a large stock find on another. This will actually cause issues further down the line with existing stock management.

Nobody in-store controls customer stock intake and outgoing. We only order staff/store supplies. All stock is dictated by a myriad of input data from past history, upcoming events, seasonal, area sales and so forth. If a store sells 50% of its egg supplies and puts the other 50% on loss for out of date then after a while that line will be reduced 25% or more. If a store continually sells a stock and come gap check (go around the store checking for sold out items) you will see an increase in the line if possible.

With eggs, they are a ""Gold product"" or something like that name which means we *should* have a constant stock. /u/LordAnubis12 explained that on a one off occasion the store through uncontrollable events ran out of a gold stock. This can *only* be fixed through a delivery which are scheduled in advanced and if repeat line sell outs occur then you can bet that line of eggs will be increase.

I did 4 years in one store and our milk lines would fluctuate every other month. Blue and green would be dipping and increasing and we would automatically be changing volumes to meet customer satisfaction. To suggest a multi-billion quid company is dumb to the idea of meeting customer demands is dim.

Not only do you lose cash trying to negotiate such a swap but unless there is a pre-existing system established you've got a large loss on one store and a large stock find on another. This will actually cause issues further down the line with existing stock management.

Dealing with an inter-store transfer is easy - unless the business is still working with paper ledgers for stock. 

&gt;  This can only be fixed through a delivery which are scheduled in advanced and if repeat line sell outs occur then you can bet that line of eggs will be increase.

The difference between good retail and great retail is dealing with this stuff so that 'gold' products can be supplied at short notice. its not easy of course but it is a business worth billions so it can be achieved. 

&gt; To suggest a multi-billion quid company is dumb to the idea of meeting customer demands is dim.

Sainsbury's 10 years ago was just that dumb - it happens all the time. They had a terrible stock performance, after implementing a system bought from extremely expensive consultants. It was the no 1 priority of Justin King when he joined and they did indeed manage to get it better. Tesco is an example *today* that is failing to meet customer demands left right and centre and their sales are in free-fall - as are Morrisons.

true,IMKridegga,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"These are some commonly suggested starting places but it all really depends on what you think this person would enjoy in Doctor Who.  

'An Unearthly Child Episode 1' is probably the best introduction to the show as a whole, but if he/she would be bothered by grainy black-and-white film it might not be the best idea to start there. 

'Spearhead from Space' starts off Doctor Who in color and introduces viewers to the more Earth-focused viewpoint that the show has today, but many people today find the Classic Series serials long and boring.

'Rose' is also good as it introduces the show from a more contemporary viewpoint, but some people really dislike the animation from that era of Doctor Who.

'Blink' introduces the concept of Doctor Who without overwhelming new viewers with Doctor Who jargon and complicatedness, but it has the disadvantage of being a very atypical Doctor Who story.

'The Eleventh Hour' starts the show's its current era, but the New Series is so focused on information revealed before Series 5 that it may be frustrating for someone new to Doctor Who to have to go back and watch old episodes to get Time War trivia.

Honestly, my advice is to just pick an episode you think this person would like and show him/her that.  In theory, any episode works.

&gt;

&gt;The __Lee-Enfield__ [bolt-action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolt_action), [magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine_(firearms\))-fed, [repeating rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeating_rifle) was the main [firearm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm) used by the military forces of the [British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire) and [Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations) during the first half of the 20th century. It was the [British Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army)'s standard rifle from its official adoption in 1895 until 1957.  

&gt;A redesign of the [Lee-Metford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee-Metford) which had been adopted by the British Army in 1888, the Lee-Enfield superseded the earlier [Martini-Henry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martini-Henry), [Martini-Enfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martini-Enfield), and [Lee-Metford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee-Metford) rifles. It featured a ten-round box magazine which was loaded with the [.303 British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.303_British) [cartridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartridge_(firearms\)) manually from the top, either one round at a time or by means of five-round [chargers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripper_clip). The Lee-Enfield was the standard issue weapon to rifle companies of the British Army and other Commonwealth nations in both the [First](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I) and [Second World Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) (these Commonwealth nations included Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa, among others).  Although officially replaced in the UK with the [L1A1 SLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L1A1_Self-Loading_Rifle) in 1957, it remained in widespread British service until the early/mid-1960s and the [7.62 mm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.62_mm) L42 sniper variant remained in service until the 1990s. As a standard-issue infantry rifle, it is still found in service in the armed forces of some Commonwealth nations,  notably with the [Indian Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_India) and Bangladesh Police, which makes it the longest-serving military bolt-action rifle still in official service.  The [Canadian Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Forces)' [Rangers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Rangers) Arctic reserve unit still use Enfield No.4 rifles as of 2012 [update], with plans announced to replace the weapons sometime in 2014 or 2015.  Total production of all Lee-Enfields is estimated at over 17 million rifles. 

&gt;The Lee-Enfield takes its name from the designer of the rifle's bolt system—[James Paris Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Paris_Lee)—and the factory in which it was designed—the [Royal Small Arms Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Small_Arms_Factory) in [Enfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Enfield). In Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Southern Africa the rifle became known simply as the ""__303__"". [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

There are many uncivilised practices in the past that were acceptable in certain religions, such as slavery and dowry, yet as time has gone on, our societies have moved past such uncivilised practises in favour of a more equal and progressive society. Saying that we should just accept your judgemental and hateful stance on an entire demographic because it's your religion, simply won't cut in the 21^st century, sorry.

true,LS69,eng-yorkshire,We are Leeds,"He was appointed by Cameron while under investigation for hacking.

Because he was accused of hacking Cameron chose not to security vet him, even though it was essential for his job.

The reason he was appointed was because Cameron wanted one of Murdoch's right hand men on his payroll to try to win the election. 

After the coalition won, both Paddy Ashdown and Nick Clegg told Cameron to dump him.  They had access to information that has never been made public - probably evidence Coulson hacked MPs phones.

Some of that private evidence later came out in court - hacking David Blunkett's phone  for example.

Alan Rushbringer the Guardian's editor told Cameron the same, despite the labour leanings of the paper, he felt it was his duty to warn him of how dangerous Coulson was.

I totally think it was outrageously boneheaded, embarrassing, and disappointing.  I think it was clearly deserved of a red card.  I think the incident will be reviewed and Suarez will be rightfully punished.

But that is about it...I don't necessarily think Suarez is the anti-christ.  I'm not ashamed to root for Suarez.  I don't want him out of Liverpool.  He isn't going around and going after people's knees.  He's not trying to cause injuries and end people's careers.  He isn't hitting referees or kung-fu kicking fans.

Suarez wants to win.  Obviously he wants it so badly it cause him to go a little (or a lot) batshit sometimes, but I don't think he is trying to hurt people, he isn't going around propagating Fascism, and he isn't the worst thing that has ever happened to football--like people try to make him out to be.

He done goof'd.  He should be punished.  But I'm going to root for him the next time he is out on the pitch and I am going to root for him to stay in Liverpool.

Whether or not this moment had ulterior motives, we might not ever know. But if everyone turns on him, it will be easy for him to punch out of town. Yes, he's testing our patience and he's digging that hole deeper, but I'll stick by him. A footballer like Luis is once a lifetime and I'll take the bad with the good if he keeps making us happy on the pitch, bar killing or raping anyone. Biting is the gray area, I guess.

Shocked and bewildered? Yes. If FIFA bans him for a while playing for Uruguay, I'm totally okay with that. If FIFA sends him home early, I'm absolutely okay with that. Rest the big man up. Since its not in a Red shirt, I really couldn't give a rats ass. Selfish, but whatever. For everyone trying to shame Liverpool supporters by saying, ""I would sell him"" or ""I'm glad he's doesn't play for our team"" or ""I'm glad we never bought him."" Don't think for a second they wouldn't stab their own mothers in the back to have him play for them. They can't have him so he's always going to be on their shit list and the worst thing will be convincing Liverpool supporters to think the same way.

Bus pass will set you back a hundred or so (I think), but you'll still come out ahead. It's pretty good as well, so don't worry about that. 

Other things to note: 

* Don't choose Cartmel. Even if you do have the option (I'm not sure). Quite expensive and the furthest away from everywhere. 
* Shopping is cheaper in town, but not much. I used to do a large sainsburys shop in town, and then go to the convenience stores on campus for small things when I lived there. 
* I would avoid any basement rooms. Lancaster is an old town, and basements are usually dark, dirty and not pleasant. Most houses are terraced from the Victorian era and I doubt any basement would be desirable. 

If you don't mind me asking, what country are you coming from?

if his aggression wasn't directed outwards but towards himself (eg, he bites himself rather than other people, some people direct their aggression inwards whilst others do it outwards in high-stress situations), people would sympathize with him and recognize that its a mental disorder, but in this case, he is recognized as this malicious scumbag.

Teachers have a period of time (around 13 weeks) where they do not teach. But that does not mean they do not have many hours/days/weeks of work todo.

Schools don't run on a day to day basis, they take months of advance planning and marking. This is what teachers do in the time you call ""holiday""

Now its fair to say that they can also have plenty of free time in this period, but its certainly not a given.



&gt;Combined with the recent hardline approach to parents taking their children out of school, I can kind of sympathise with a bit of outrage in this case.

But its not the same thing. If I take my kids out of school only my kids will suffer. If a teacher takes time off and is replaced with a temp, my kids wont suffer at all.

If you want to see a big game, they will all certainly be sold out by the time general sale comes around, so you'll be out of luck.

I waited for general sale for the Southampton game this past season and couldn't get any tickets (sold out immediately), so be warned.

If you are out of luck you can try the Twitter account that re-sales tickets at face value only (forget name off hand, but do a search it'll come up), but they are almost always only singles and often very soon before a match starts (last minute cancellations, etc.). I ended up having to go on StubHub (I feel despicable about it) and bought tickets for face value, for great seats, about a week and half before the game. But I think I was very lucky - I had to check several times per day for weeks (literally) before I could find tix that weren't at least double face value.

Its really about how much risk you want to take. Personally, I wasn't ok with paying essentially a big tax just for the right to then buy the most expensive tickets in Europe. You also need to buy a membership per ticket you want to buy. I (again, personally) think its the most ridiculous insulting process to make fans endure, but to each their own.

As I've said before this more closely fits issues with anger management and emotional regulation in general. Considering his upbringing that's not surprising either.

I am talking about the structure of schooling itself when I talk of school being the problem. We all learn in different ways and a one-size-fits-all is always going to cause problems for some. In that case, for the individual involved, rather than force them to conform, it is generally best to try something else for their own well-being.

When I look at Dayna i see a hippy too, with some wacky ways for doing things. But, that is totally missing the point. That is just what happens to work for her and her family, it's her more general, fundamental ideas about human behaviour where she is good. It has nothing to do with money, organic food etc. Just human relationships, from there you and your daughter can go in any direction you wish. 

Try Alfie Kohn. As with Dayna, don't judge him by his looks and actions, it's only his ideas that matter.",0,1403636657,null,0,false,0,cifzvi7,t3_28v132,t1_cifzvi7,t1_cifyc7g,null,1434384998,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

Suarez might actually have a mental problem he can't help. He didn't do anything last season after Rodgers and LFC supported and kept an eye on him, but it retriggered during this world cup. Something is up. 

Nobody bites people 3 times in a row without knowing the consequences.

Hell, he looked like he instantly regretted the decision the moment Chelleini fell down. Italy will raise a huge stink, FIFA will most likely take action, and Suarez will be banned. 

He loves to play though, why would he want to do something like this, even if it means his team won today? Now he won't be able to help Uruguay advance, his family are going to be in deeper shame and the tabloids ACROSS THE WORLD (not just England) will rip him to pieces. The pieces don't add up. This isn't the work of a sadistic asshole. He's really screwed up in the head when it comes to high pressure situations like today's game. I think he needs to get a personal therapist, and work something out before every game. This is beyond ridiculous.

And their extended warranties are about as fair as it gets; 10% of the purchase price gets you a 5 year guarantee, and you can get a full refund at the end of the 5 years if you never used it.  Also worth noting is that if you join their VIP club (free), the warranty on a TV is free: http://www.richersounds.com/information/warranties.

He didn't hit a woman, he didn't kill anyone drunk driving, he didn't fuck his brother's wife for years on end, he didn't do drugs (well, maybe if you think about it), he didn't gamble against his own team, he didn't end anyone's career with a tackle, etc. Hypocritical? Maybe, but for me its sort of like what you do on your own time is your own business. What happens in the work place is different. And on that account, he hasn't done anything like that in a Liverpool shirt.

calling a person a cunt = bad

killing people = bad

both are bad but one is worse.

spitting = bad

biting = bad

whilst both biting and spitting are bat, biting is worse than spitting in the same way that murder is worse than calling somebody a cunt. 

DO YOU UNDERSTAND THIS VERY BASIC CONCEPT??? 

because biting is more bad (I assume you don't know what the word ""worse"" means) than spitting, I think Suarez is more bad than Costa. I think that Suarez is so bad that I do not like him. I do not think that Costa is bad enough for me to not like him.

Is a man biting someone on the same level as a man who's put in an an intentional tackle meant to maim? Is a man biting someone on the same level as a punch in the face or in the groin? Is a man biting someone on the same level as going up and deliberately landing on an opponent's head? So he allegedly bit someone. This is way more embarrassing rather than damning in-terms of injury to an opponent. 

Luis did screw up and no one is denying that. But what OP is saying what is the big deal with all of the reactionary moralist saying that we should sell him and he should never play for Liverpool again or that he's the scourge of the Earth and that the evil bastard sets the worst example for all of the children of Mankind for generations to come. Not at all. Not by a country mile. We've obviously learned that Luis shouldn't be a role model for your fucking kids and if you still think so, then I don't know what to say. I could see the argument being slightly more valid if he did it again in a Liverpool shirt, but he didn't. So honestly I don't really care as much. Whatever.

And no one is saying he shouldn't be punished or get off with a light sentence. He deserves everything that's coming to him. To think that we're defending him so blindly that he doesn't deserve repercussions is just asinine. Don't be a typical Redditor and just say shit something off the cuff just on an assumption or that you can't read. As they say, ""Assumption is the mother of all fuckups.""

true,Drugba,MN,mongolia,"First of all, it's a joke. No where in my mind do I actually support the idea of killing someone over a bite on the shoulder that didn't even break the skin. I know it's hard to convey tone through text, but you can't honestly think  that I actually believed the proper response to a being bitten is the death penalty.

Second, the bite is such a big deal because it is so out of context of the game in addition to the fact that he is a repeat offender. You are correct reckless tackles have the possibility to be much more damaging than a bite on the shoulder, but they are much harder to prove as malicious. Except for maybe the worst tackles, there is often doubt about whether the goal was to actually injure a player, or just a stupid reckless attempt at winning the ball back.

As for why people are exploding over this, and not the headbutts, is because this is so uncommon even in reference to violent retaliation. Players headbutt because it's such a small movement and they can try and make it look natural or play it off as an accident. Like it or not, it's kind of common. Biting on the other hand is a move that seems to only be done by Suarez. It's almost become his signature move.

The reason the biting is so over blown is because A) unlike tackles, there is no valid reason to ever put your teeth on another player in the game and B) unlike the headbutts, it isn't a common thing.

It'd be like if everyone found out John Terry had another affair. It's only happened once (that we know of), but it's what he's known for now. Suarez has an over blown reputation for biting people and he just lived up to the caricature of himself.

You can criticize Islam, homophobia and hatred without stirring up yet even MORE hatred and generalizing a whole group of people and sucking innocent people into the hate mongering agenda in the process. I'm not going to make excuses for religion or homophobia or be a door mat but i'm also not going answer hate with hate, that doesn't work. 

I appreciate people care about LGBT people, but I don't appreciate it when they use me as a spring board to launch their hate mongering agenda, and I don't appreciate them hiding behind a mask of concern for my well being when they do it, since they never have anything nice to say about gay people outside of these instances. You do not right hate with hate, all you get is more hate. 

Like it's just *so* obvious when you see people who say they are ""conerned"" about the safety of LGBT people just use homophobia as a springboard to further their hate mongering agenda, and that is direspectful to LGBT people and muslims/immigrants who are also LGBT or are not homophobic but still might get sucked into the hate mongering agenda and become a victim of a hate crime themselves. 

If an innocent muslim who has no problem with LGBT people or might even BE LGBT gets beaten up because of this hate mongering against muslims and immigrants, then how are we any better than them?

Right now in the UK outside small pockets in London, muslims and immigrant are probably more likely to be victims of hate crimes than me as a gay person due to the massive hate mongering campaign against them right now.

Right. Who're precisely the smokers this bill targets.

In response to the first question. If getting you to quit smoking is as simple as some man in a suit telling you you have to quit smoking, why hasn't that worked already? Has no-one told you to quit smoking? Should I do that now?

Even if cigarettes were illegal you'd still be able to obtain them, the temptation would still be there for you only it'd be even more harmful than it is now.

And yes, apart from the smokers who're under 17 whom we've asserted exist because that's the entire justification for this bill, we're not asking anyone to quit cold turkey... you know, apart from the people this bill is designed to target.

These 'legal' alcohols - which were not for imbiding recreationally - still found their way in the hands of recreational drinkers.

true,WDC312,lfc68,,"Not wrong at all.

Missing out on the Champions League has cost the club hundreds of millions of pounds in revenue, not to mention players like Mkhitaryan.

Suarez' bites and racial abuse have maybe caused sponsors to rethink their commitments to the club.  Can you quantify that?  Has it cost us hundreds of millions of pounds?  Does Suarez' presence mean we won't be able to sign top talents?  Maybe, no, and definitely no.

Suarez isn't the only footballer in the world, you're right.  He's just one of the best.  He contributed to 42 league goals this season.  Obviously, if he hadn't been playing, someone else would've taken his space and contributed a few goals, but who?  Victor Moses?  Let's say I'm an optimist, and I think that with 30+ games Moses could've given us 10 goals and 5 assists.  Let's also say that we would've conceded 7 fewer goals, since we would've lined up 4-3-3, and wouldn't have attacked quite so heavily.  Even with a solid season from Moses, and an improved defensive record, we're still down 20 goals (net) from where we were with Suarez.

How much is twenty goals worth?

Well, we could look at prices for strikers in that range.  Sturridge scored 21 goals for us this past season; would you accept an offer of 20m for him?  30m?  Karim Benzema scored 17 goals in La Liga this year; what do you think he's worth?  I think it's safe to say that a 20 goal a season striker is worth around 30 million pounds these days.

Or you could look at where we'd end up with a goal difference of 31, rather than 51.  As things turn out, we wouldn't be that much worse off- we'd finish 3rd, behind Chelsea.  Not terrible- we'd still be in the Champions League, and it would only cost us about a [million](http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2012-13/may/premier-league-total-broadcasting-payments-season-2012-13.html) pounds.  But again, that's assuming Moses had a decent season, and we were better defensively- if those two things weren't true, it's quite easy to see us slipping to fourth, or lower, without Suarez.  After all, Arsenal's goal difference was +27, only four worse than our hypothetical sans-Suarez difference of +31.  There's the merit pay of a million pounds per position in the table, and then there's the question of Champions League.  Fourth place needs to play a qualifier to get into the group stage.  Let's say CL revenues are 50m pounds, and that we have a 90% chance of making it through the qualifier (seems fair).  Then fourth place costs us another 5m pounds in expected value versus second.  If we miss out on the CL, that's 40m pounds of lost revenue, assuming the EL pays us 10m (a generous assumption).

Then let's look at the intangibles.  Without Suarez, our style of play is less exciting, and draws fewer fans from around the world.  A spot or two lower in the table also likely makes a big difference to sponsors.  But let's ignore all that, because I can't really quantify it, and get back to the harder numbers.

Then without Suarez, we lose up to 42 million pounds in revenue this season *with our very optimistic estimates, and not even including the intangibles and hard-to-pin-down numbers.*

42 million is easily worth a bite a year.  Hell, 10 million is easily worth a bite a year.  Granted, the numbers are all fuzzy and theoretical, but I don't see you even making an attempt to figure out what it would have cost us if we hadn't had Suarez this season.  I haven't even seen you try to quantify how much Suarez' antics are costing the club.

true,slippyg,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Since you will need to do a 'letter before action' for any court proceedings, here's some info from another post I wrote here on Reddit about deposit legislation, it's quotes the relevant sections with the irrelevant stuff removed.

The legislation in question is as follows:

    213 Requirements relating to tenancy deposits

    (1)Any tenancy deposit paid to a person in connection with a shorthold 
    tenancy must, as from the time when it is received, be dealt with in accordance with an authorised scheme.


    (1)Where a tenancy deposit has been paid in connection with a shorthold tenancy, 
    the tenant or any relevant person (as defined by section 213(10)) may make an application to a county court on the grounds—

    (a)that the initial requirements of an authorised scheme (see section 213(4)) have 
    not, or section 213(6)(a) has not, been complied with in relation to the deposit; or

    (b)that he has been notified by the landlord that a particular authorised scheme applies
    to the deposit but has been unable to obtain confirmation from the scheme administrator 
    that the deposit is being held in accordance with the scheme.
    
    (3)The court must, as it thinks fit, either—
    (b)order that person to pay the deposit into the designated account held by the scheme administrator 
    under an authorised custodial scheme,

    (3)The court must, as it thinks fit, either—
    (a)order the person who appears to the court to be holding the deposit to repay it to the applicant, or
    (b)order that person to pay the deposit into the designated account held by the scheme administrator under an authorised
     custodial scheme,within the period of 14 days beginning with the date of the making of the order.
    
    (4)The court must also order the landlord to pay to the applicant a sum of money equal to three times 
    the amount of the deposit within the period of 14 days beginning with the date of the making of the order.

I note above OP said that you cannot get your deposit back through court, well, you absolutely can. [Form N208.](http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=424) I disagree with other posts saying you do not need a solicitor, however, if you cannot find one there is guidance on-line, the admin desk at your county court will vary between helpful and beyond unhelpful.

I'd also point out that, especially on Reddit, there seems to be an unrealistic expectation of how much you will be awarded from this. There is no guarantee you will get more than 1x the deposit and there is no guarantee that the court won't order that you do pay any damages that the agent/landlord can evidence, I would bear this in mind if you haven't included anything which may be relevant to the claim in your post. Also you will have to pay the costs until the court makes judgement and again there is no guarantee you will win these back - you really should consult someone that knows what they're doing and not the internet (including me)",0,1403643287,null,0,1403643830,0,cig3gt6,t3_28zpm8,t1_cig3gt6,t1_cig2rmp,null,1434386762,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

Housing Act 2004, 213.1 states: ""Any tenancy deposit paid to a person in connection with a shorthold tenancy must, as from the time when it is received, be dealt with in accordance with an authorised scheme."". I'm guessing from what you've described, and reading the housing act section on deposits (http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/34/part/6/chapter/4), this is only one of a number of clauses they haven't abided by.

Write down the situation on paper (get your thoughts together), get all your paperwork from the tenancy, and contact Bristol City Council. Explain your situation clearly, without desperate emotional pleas. Bonus points if the letting agency are stupid enough to write this down in an eMail or a letter. Don't record telephone conversations, I'm pretty sure that's illegal without notifying the other party.

Call the council. It's their job to enforce these laws.

However I have had one or two really, really nasty incidents. The worst was a guy who asked me the time at a bus stop in the middle of the day and proceeded to follow me up the road, wait for me outside a shop, follow me to another bus stop, get on the bus and sit in the seat next to me trapping me by the window (despite the bus being nearly empty).

He talked at me for over 15 minutes, alternating between telling me how pretty I would be if I smiled for him and then aggressively trying to push me into giving him my number. After the fourth ""No, sorry."" I gave up responding and stared out of the window (with my headphones in!) completely silently while he kept going on and on and on. He found this absolutely hilarious, never giving up for more than 30 seconds before trying to talk to me again. He also rubbed his leg against mine and reached out to touch me with his hand and laughed in my face when I pulled my knee away from him (looking desperately uncomfortable).

After his mate pulled him off the bus two stops before mine (thank fuck for that!) I looked around the bus and there were a few people giving me sympathetic looks and shaking their heads so his harassment clearly didn't go unnoticed. I was 19.

I get creeped out to this day when I think about how he might've reacted if I'd had to get off the bus before him. Ugh.

repeating 'apples and oranges' is not an argument, its a vague opinion

yes a jab at the system - but no not an ill informed one. they are constantly being asked to modify and restrict their behavior, being fined if they don't comply. they are in a reasonable position to have an opinion about those that are enforcing that system.

&gt; The result is the victimization of one man - there's been no certain knock-on effect to the classes he would usually take (let me know if the school didn't provide an alternate teacher to convey the material and the kids sat there learning nothing for a couple of weeks in the teachers absence, then we'll have poor judgement from the school that's worth commenting on).

from what you've written - i just don't think you've been to a decent school or understand anything about leadership. schools - or at least the education department - have *recently* made it clear that any kind of absence from class - even one day - is so detrimental to the childs education that the parent should never, never ever do it. if we are to apply that same dedication to the provision of the education - and not just the reception of it. its easy to say ' a temp will do it, someone will fill in' but if you are being honest - and i doubt you are - you would recognise that a temporary fill for a teacher and a temporary fill for a leader are rarely as good as the usual.

true,34Mbit,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"Yeah there are extra overheads, no one is denying that. What I'm saying is I think Primark's prices more accurately reflect the true cost of design, manufacture, transport and retail than the slightly more 'up-market' retailers like Arcadia Group.

I don't understand people who think £100 for a single/double colour t-shirt at all reflects the true cost to the retailer. It's been common knowledge for decades now that the biggest markup in the fashion chain is the retailer. Far eastern workers get paid pennies on the pound regardless of if they're cutting for Lacoste or Fruit of the Loom.

If you think paying more at the till will at all reflect in better conditions or pay for far eastern workers then you're deluding yourself (unless you go somewhere like Savile Row, etc.).

If you bought fifteen Ray-bans, that is almost the same ammount as money as a car. A machine with more precision moving parts than an egg-timer has grains of sand.

This drug has single-handedly caused majority of divorces in Somali/Yemeni communities. This is also the reason why it's common to see unemployed Somali/Yemeni people in café chatting all day everyday.

I recall seeing people in cafés in and around Sana'a chewing khat. They seemed quite convivial and it looked a lot like the sort of pleasant social bonding you see in the pub in the UK. I wasn't aware that the downside was this severe: what sort of proportion of khat users in Yemen have these sort of problems?

I did spend a few days bumping across the desert with some locals who were chewing khat ""to keep alert"". Their pupils were dilated up and they seemed *very* alert, almost trigger happy. I'm not sure how much of this was the direct effect of the khat and how much was indirect because there's only so many days you can stay awake before your judgement starts to go.

Meanwhile the public are screaming for immigration controls - but the government has been looking the other way over the easiest route to immigration - Student Visas.

As a foreigner myself (through Work Visas) I've come across countless foreigners who have told me about how they've only been studying to qualify for entry so they could work. Or shamelessly told me of their intention to marry for residency. A lot of students have been taking bogus courses - because it was a route to the Tier 1 student visa (valid upon graduation).

I guess, like so many ""well, duh"" moments the government is now having, such as alternatives to 0845 numbers in government helplines, it is good that Student Visas are being addressed - but shameful that it has taken so long to merely acknowledge the problems.",0,1403645549,null,0,false,0,cig4mwc,t3_28zy9x,t1_cig4mwc,t3_28zy9x,null,1434387314,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

The inevitable problem with that lineup for 4-2-2-2 is that, with just Gerrard and Henderson in midfield, we'll be overrun every time. It doesn't even matter how physical the midfield we're up against is. 

Look at the midfields of other successful 4-2-2-2's; Arsenal had Vieira and Petit/Gilberto Silva. United had Keane and Scholes. Most relevantly, coming in the recent PL where 3-man midfields have become more common, City have Toure and Fernandinho. 

In all 3 of those pairings, both players are mobile, at least one of them is a true defensive/tackling midfielder, and with the exception of Scholes, each of the others is an adept tackler in midfield as well. Gerrard lacks mobility to cover the amount of ground required of a 2-CM midfielder. Henderson presses really well but isn't the most frequent of tacklers; and having him press with no other pressing support in midfield is going to be ineffectual and a waste of his work rate.

As long as Gerrard's in the team, 4-2-2-2 is just not an option at all. ",0,1403646693,null,0,false,0,cig57x6,t3_28usav,t1_cig57x6,t1_cifvbbc,null,1434387589,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

The biggest problem with khat is that unlike other common drugs which does have ""hard"" limit that your body can take. If you drink too much alcohol, you would either die or black out. Khat doesn't do that. So, you get people chewing khat all day and this causes addiction. Most of those people do have families, job, etc. In the end, they lose it all.

I don't know proportion of Yemeni chewers having that problem but I can only assume it is similar to Somali as our culture are similar. I would say more than half of khat chewers has this problem. It's very hard to chew khat while not chewing it too much and getting addicted to it purely because of societal setting where khat is likely to be chewed. 

Khat is stimulant. It's common that khat is used to keep awake but usually only in countries like Yemen, Somalia and Ethiopia.

Perhaps you missed the week in school where they taught the principal principles of English, including spelling and punctuation ;)

&gt;You seriously think anyone with half a brain is going to side with the argument that taking children to Brazil to watch overpaid failures is worth making a teacher taking a legitimate break headline news?

You can't look at the outrage in isolation. Parents across the UK now face paying twice the price for holidays *if* they can even get the time off work, due to it now being so competitive to book time off in school holidays.

People have been lectured to by patronising teachers and told off for wanting to give their child a holiday, so of course there's going to be anger when it transpires that, actually, the very same headteachers who have been so harsh with parents are allowed to piss off on holiday whenever they feel like it.

Actually, the US was a great help in the Falklands. They sent a fuck-ton of fuel and ammo to RAF Ascension (which is also a co-located USAF outpost) and laid out a payment plan that was basically that we steal what we needed and figure out how to pay after victory.

The US also sent brand-new Sidewinder missiles and the ground crew to fit them to our Harriers. (Maggie said that our victory was heavily dependent on the Sidewinder).

They re-tasked a 2-month old top-secret sigint spy satellite from Central America to the theatre of war to provide eavesdropping on Argentine communications (in an era when the BBC news reports took days to reach home).

And made the USS Iwo Jima available to the Royal Navy in the event that one of our carriers was sunk, to be crewed by the Royal Navy after training from their US equivalents.

Fortunately I did get my deposit back in the end and hopefully you will too. I'm not a solicitor BTW so this is all just my take on it. 

1. The advice already given here regarding who to seek help from is good, in addition I would recommend giving Shelter( https://www.shelter.org.uk/)  a call, they are a housing charity and were really helpful and knew their stuff when I spoke to them. Also, the donation I ended up making to them because I was so grateful for their help was a lot cheaper than a solicitor would have been. :)

2. Are you a student? Just a guess as this is a common time of year for students to be moving house. If so, the Uni may be able to help. My uni had people who dealt with this sort of thing all the time and could give advice, they also held a register of approved agencies/landlords so any repeat offenders ran the risk of being off their accredited list and therefore losing out on potential business. Also, the law department had a ""law clinic"" that offered free legal advice, this may even have extended to non-students, I'm not sure.  Maybe yours has something similar, apologies if you're not a student. 

3. Make it clear that you are not afraid to take them to court if needs be. Admittedly you can't really afford to but that's different to being afraid and realistically they don't want to go to court or pay solicitors fees any more than you do and it'll let them know that you're not just another easy target for them (they've likely done this before and got away with it) and you won't bend to their bullying and blackmail. 

3. A slightly different take on things. . . My first reaction on reading your post was along the lines of ""whatever you do, don't sign that NDA"". Then I figured the only reason they would want you to sign one is as you said, to protect their reputation. So I'm going to play Devil's advocate and give them the benefit of the doubt of a minute or two. If they are a big letting agents as you have said and depending on the size of their business and the size of your deposit then maintaining their reputation could be worth a lot more to them than your deposit, possibly an order of magnitude. If that's the case then perhaps you could sign the NDA as long as you have solid get out clauses, something to the effect of the agreement becoming null and void unless you receive your full deposit in cleared funds within 7 days of the date of the agreement being signed.(Emphasis on full, unless you know of any reasonable deductions beyond wear and tear which should be made in which case show good faith and specify what you believe to be a fair amount)  

I can see one of 3 things happening: 

a) They will refuse to sign with a get out clause, in which case you aren't really any worse off than you are now. 

b) They sign, you sign, each party holds up their side of the deal and you have your money back (although admittedly they have to some degree got away with being dicks, at least for the period of validity of the NDA, after which you would be free to expose them for the dicks they are but at least you have your money, depends to what extent you also want the moral victory or just your cash) 
 
c) They sign, you sign but they don't pay in which case you will be worse off for 7 days but after that are essentially in the same situation as a) but they have also shown themselves to be doubly untrustworthy which ultimately just gives you more evidence to use against them if/when it does go legal. Of course you would want someone (maybe Citizens Advice Bureau) to look over the NDA first to make sure the extent of your risk is only ever those 7 days. 

Admittedly it's a long shot and I think the most likely option is a) but it's also potentially close to risk free for you and could be a quick way of getting your money back if they do put their reputation first and go for b)



Sorry for the essay, hope you get your deposit back soon

Like, literally the best likely scenario was that the referee wouldn't see it and he'd get a lengthy ban from video evidence after the game (which is what is probably going to happen). The other likely scenario would be a straight red. Neither of those are particularly helping his team win the game or tournament.

This has nothing to do with how far you're prepared to go to win. He didn't dive. He didn't conspire to get someone sent off. He didn't cheat. He lost his head and bit a guy. It's not defensible, it's not something I want to see on the pitch, but it's not something that comes about from a ""win at all costs"" attitude. It's something that comes about from him having poor self-control and not being able to keep his temper, not some kind of logical attempt to increase his chances of winning through cheating. Diving is winning at all costs, biting people is just insanity. ",1,1403651775,null,0,1403652715,0,cig7omp,t3_28zkl1,t1_cig7omp,t1_cig6cff,null,1434388751,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

&gt; 

Luis Suárez’s hopes of securing a dream move to Barcelona or Real Madrid hang in the balance after the Liverpool forward’s reputation suffered considerable damage as he appeared to bite an opponent for the third time in his career.

Giorgio Chiellini, the Italy defender, claimed that he was a victim of a Suárez bite when the pair clashed during the second half of Uruguay’s 1-0 win over Italy. Previously, Suárez was banned for seven matches for biting Otman Bakkal, the PSV Eindhoven midfield player, while at Ajax and was also suspended for ten matches for a similar assault on Branislav Ivanovic, the Chelsea defender, during Liverpool’s 2-2 draw with the Barclays Premier League club in April 2013.

The common denominator on each occasion — along with Suárez’s own appalling behaviour — was that the incidents occurred at a time when he was considering his own future. The question now is whether he has undermined his chances of joining either Barcelona or Real, with the two Spanish clubs having to decide whether signing such a recidivist would be worth the trouble.

In recent weeks, various members of Suárez’s inner circle have gone public on his desire to move to La Liga. “The best solution” for the 27-year-old would be “to go to Spain” Gustavo Balbi, his father-in-law, said yesterday. Earlier in the summer, Suárez’s solicitor, Alejandro Balbi, said:“If there is such a big offer from Real Madrid, it would be very difficult to say no.”

The messages were not even discreet, but they have had the desired effect with Spain’s two powerhouses showing increasing signs of being ready to fight for Suárez’s signature. Now, both clubs will be faced with the reality that if they do win the race (if one now takes place), they will be acquiring one of the biggest pariahs in world football and all that goes with him.

Liverpool have grown used to Suárez and his baggage, but until now neither his notoriety nor his volatility has tempted them to sever links with a player who has established himself as one of the world’s best despite his antics. Before yesterday’s events, they were facing up to a second successive summer in which their ability to retain Suárez’s services would be tested. Now, they appear to be facing another, but equally familiar, test — rehabilitating an individual who appears unable to learn from his mistakes.

After his bite on Ivanovic, Suárez showed his contrition with a single tweet: “I am truly very sorry. I hope that all the people who I have offended at Anfield last Sunday will grant me forgiveness.” He also demonstrated his desire to improve his behaviour by attending sessions with Dr Steve Peters and his work with the psychiatrist paid off last season with Suárez being named player of the year by the Professional Footballers Association and the Football Writers Association.

So confident was Suárez that he had put his bad ways behind him that he felt able to round on his critics in “the English media” after Uruguay’s defeat of England last week. His anger had been sparked by the front page of The Sun on the day of the game, which highlighted his penchant for biting. “Too many people in England laughed about my attitude over the last few years,” he complained on Monday.

Only 24 hours later he offered his critics all the ammunition they could ever wish for with an act that brought himself into further disrepute.

A Fifa spokesman said that its disciplinary committee will wait for the referee’s report “in order to evaluate the matter”. Suárez is likely to be punished heavily, the only doubts surrounding the length of his suspension. Fifa’s disciplinary code sets a maximum ban of 24 matches or two years, but the longest ban in World Cup history was eight games for Italy’s Mauro Tassotti for breaking Luis Enrique’s nose against Spain in 1994 with an elbow.

It seems likely that any ban will apply only to international football, but there could also be repercussions for Liverpool. Standard Chartered, the club’s shirt sponsor, went public on its disquiet after Suárez failed to shake Patrice Evra’s hand in February 2012 after serving a seven-match ban for racially abusing the Manchester United defender, while Ian Ayre, Liverpool’s chief executive, later admitted that the club’s brand had been damaged by the controversy resulting from the Uruguayan’s bite on Ivanovic.

“Luis is a street-fighter. He is what he is,” Ayre said in September 2013. “We have worked a lot with Luis since the last incident with Ivanovic. He has been prepared to commit to that sort of work on his character.” The intention of that work was to ensure that Suárez remained a Liverpool player for as long as possible. It is therefore ironic that his latest fall from grace appears to have increased the chances of him staying at Anfield.

A lot of people are getting quite uppity in my opinion, saying they want him out and we should get rid of him. I agree that he has some issues to sort out, but getting rid of him would be ridiculous, especially if we terminate him and can't afford to replace him. It's an unpopular opinion, but I think biting is actually a rather creative (though socially unacceptable and quite strange) way to express yourself on the pitch. It's relatively harmless, doesn't end peoples' careers, and gets the point across. I'd rather see him dole out a little chomp here and there than beat the shit out of someone and get sent to jail.

Fact is Suarez is a big positive for us on the pitch in his goals and assists. If he has a few negatives like biting players then it detracts from that, but until sponsors start getting angsty or the bans get ridiculous he's still almost certainly a net positive. Maybe some people will say that it's double-standards, but so long as the club remains a business it's how they'll manage it. If you're a £80m player then you can afford to do £30m worth of stupid shit and you'll still be one of the most valuable players in the team. If you're a £5m player then £30m of stupid shit means you're clearly more trouble than you're worth and you'll be booted out first opportunity.

I'd also say a big part is that we know a lot about Suarez's personality and character from interviews. We know how he is with his family, and such, and it helps lend sympathy to the idea that he's a nice guy who occasionally has moments of madness. On the other hand, if Conor Coady had bitten people and racially abused people, that would be literally all I'd know about him because there aren't any interviews to give me the flip side of the coin and his story, so my opinion would probably go towards ""he seems like a massive cunt"", rather than ""he's just a nice guy who is misunderstood and has anger management issues""",0,1403653504,null,0,false,0,cig8g1t,t3_2903ni,t1_cig8g1t,t1_cig55me,null,1434389109,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

I would argue biting is less severe in all categories save shock value, which is precisely why Luis will be so thoroughly vilified for this.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;In 10 years that will no longer be true.

Whether it's true or not in 10 years time depends on the decisions we make in those next 10 years, whether we are part of the EU or not, and what happens in other countries around the world in that time. 

There's no reason we cannot continue to grow. And at the same time you cannot say with certainty how things will go with the other economy's around the world. The huge growth that places like China and India have been relying on for the past few years is slowing, which is causing real problems for China in particular, who were expecting that growth to continue for many more years. And today Dubai's stock market crashed.

You have made the claim that in 10 years the UK will be irrelevant, but where is your evidence showing that to be the case, the facts seem to say otherwise, I don't see anything that suggests that the UK, let alone the whole of Europe, will be irrelevant in 10 years time. 

&gt;unless of course you are comfortable going back to being the irrelevant backwater you were in the Middle Ages.That's what nationalism will get you.

Just more meaningless hyperbole from someone who can only see the options that are presented to him by the media - Either we are in Europe or we are out. The truth is far more complicated. Any deal we have with the EU we could have without being a member, and being out of the EU allows us to open up our own negotiations with the rest of the world. Being more independent of the EU gives us more opportunity to grow, not less. 

&gt;This is not true. Here are the actual reasons for the improvements in the British Economy.

Its all true, our economy is growing faster than any of the other economy's in Europe, and by staying out of the Euro we were safe from any of the negative impacts that it could have caused us as it has with so many countries in Europe the last few years. The fact that we didn't suffer from the near collapse of the Euro put us in a more stable position economically and allowed our economy to grow without as much interruption.

I have been bit while paying sports (basketball).  I pushed the guy away, said ""what the fuck dude"", then kept playing.  It was much less of a scene than when someone puts their shoulder into me and tries to knock me over.

On the spectrum of illegal conduct, I see biting as slightly worse than a handball on the line like Suarez in the last WC, slightly better than a headbutt like Zidane in 2006, and not nearly as bad as what Pepe did.

And still you somehow have the mad, blind bias to claim that it's all one big conspiracy. Such a staggering, unhealthy victim complex. I'm flabbergasted that you lot can sit there and spew this shit with straight faces, seemingly not realizing how utterly pathetic and hilarious it is to see presuambly grown men act like mothers defending their infant sons. Suarez truly can do no wrong.

What manner of global conspiracy would this be for Chiellini to have pre-planned his impeccable reaction and consequent complaint to the ref, and for people to sit ready to photoshop teethmarks onto his shoulder on multiple different photographs within minutes of the incident? And this would all have to depend on there actually being a situation where Suarez happens to do something that could be interpreted visually as a bite (but of course isn't). Unholy fucker of mothers, I've never seen such paralysing stupidity as you get from Liverpool's fans whenever Suarez does something mental. Goodness me.

Just how far is Suarez allowed to go before you'll realize it's not the whole world conspiring against him and/or LFC? Jesus wept.

Why would a liverpool fan do that? It's surely a leap to assume that. By your logic, surely it's more likely to be a Uruguay fan seeing as any potential ban would keep Suarez out of international fixtures, particularly their next round game with Colombia...

In fact I'm certain that there is no precedent to ban Suarez from club games for his actions whilst on international duty so Suarez being banned only helps Liverpool fans as he will be kept fresh and rested for the summer and a chunk of next season as he will not be called up for friendlies or Copa America qualifying for the forseeable future.

Can anybody submit articles to that subreddit or just the BBC? IF anybody can, what's the point? Isn't that the whole point of reddit anyway, so that it's just people talkign on it and sharing things rather than organisations? 


Does the BBC even understand the concept of reddit? Not sure what's happening or why the fuck this has come into existance, or if it's even the real BBC? Is it just somebody pretending to be from the BBC? Or somebody who works for the BBC doing this from home like an idiot? 

Lets take a look at what reddit is. It's a website that shares social media, people upvote, people downvote. People can then take subreddits as their own and ban anybody, remove any comments, self moderate. If the BBC has a moderator who has an agenda, in effect the BBC will be pushes that agenda by pumping time and effort into that subreddit. It would have to be self moderated by the BBC.

After that, who can post? Only the BBC, I think only the BBC should be able to post anything, otherwise it's susceptible to brigading, from upvotes and downvotes and ultimately again what stores come out top of the subreddit. 

So there are a lot of questions of if I'd get by just shouting UKip on every article at every chance I get, because if that's my opinon and my choice how can the BBC ban that? I pay taxes to them! This is where that shit storm would come from.

Bearing in mind the addition of the War Doctor and 11 being technically the Doctor's final incarnation before the new cycle was added this refers to Tennant's regeneration specifically. 

As you may recall 10 was particularly distraught at his impending regeneration. Unlike most of his other incarnations who accepted it 10 fought it with every fiber of his being, staving it off for a significant period while he went around saying goodbye to every companion he'd ever had. Even at the end he didn't want to change. So at the moment of regeneration we have a Doctor who is full of sadness, rage and despair. The Valeyard was said to be a personification of all of the Doctor's negative emotions such as these and so it's not that big of a stretch to assume this is the moment of his creation, when these emotions are at their peak during a regeneration. As for how he gained physical form and appeared earlier in the Doctor's personal timeline, the regeneration was particularly violent and severely damaged the TARDIS console. This could have caused the Doctor's emotions and regeneration energy to merge and enter the heart of the TARDIS, falling through the time vortex with the sheer strength of the Doctor's emotions coupled with the regeneration energy giving rise to the physical incarnation of the Valeyard who ends up on Gallifrey around the time of the Sixth Doctor which leads directly into the Trial of a Time Lord.",0,1403659648,null,0,false,0,cigb3d5,t3_290dhe,t1_cigb3d5,t3_290dhe,null,1434390427,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

&gt;__Abhartach__ (also __avartagh__, [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language) for dwarf) is an early [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland) [legend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend), which was first collected in [Patrick Weston Joyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Weston_Joyce)'s *The Origin and History of Irish Names of Places* (1875).  Abhartach should not be confused with the similarly named [Abartach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abartach), a figure associated with [Fionn mac Cumhaill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fionn_mac_Cumhaill).

true,Silent_Ranger,null,null,"I honestly don't care about this anymore. Obviously he has a psychological problem that causes him to freak out during matches in high pressure situations. Wright Thompson provides a lot of insight into why this is in [this article](http://espn.go.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/10984370/portrait-serial-winner-luis-suarez-soccer-most-beautiful-player). As far as I'm concerned he needs help, serious therapy, but that doesn't make him a ""bad person"" as most of the British media have made him out to be over the past few years. What is more indicative of his character as a human being is how he responds to this, does he take responsibility and apologize, does he take steps to prevent this from recurring in the future, these are the things that to me are more indicative of his character than a single stupid action in an intense situation. 

As a Liverpool fan I think that brushing it under the rug isn't wise, we should confront it not with denial but with positive and progressive action that is favor of Suarez's personal interests (i.e. help him figure out how to deal with this anger issue) as well as the clubs (make a public statement of support for the player with still distancing ourselves from and condemning the action itself). I think Suarez has made it clear in the past that he wished he never did it the first time...or the second time...and this time will be the same, but their is something in him that he has little control over, an ingrained reflex to literally attack an opponent on the pitch when he feels threatened (see Wright Thompson's article). Maybe the best thing for him would be a move to Barcelona where he can be closer to Sofia's family. If that's true I support him going there. He is a hugely important player for Liverpool but he is not bigger than the club itself, he is replaceable (not by any one player but by an improved *team*). This latest situation does concern me to think: ""what will happen in a CL semi-final, will Suarez bite someone again and get suspended for a whole CL season?"" This would certainly hurt the club more than selling him and bringing in other players.

In the end I just want Suarez to be able to overcome his ingrained violent defense mechanisms and play without any new outbursts. He is a fantastic player and I would love to see him become a legend for Liverpool, but if what's best for him is to leave then we should let him leave, we'll be better off for in the long run and he'd be better off as well. But lastly most of all I just want to end the ""Suarez is a morally corrupt person"" line. It's popular, it's cheap, it's not even very accurate. Mental illnesses (which is really what Suarez is dealing with here) should never be used to beat people down, they should be used to educate others and help those who suffer from them.",0,1403661435,null,0,1403661734,0,cigbuii,t3_28zdj6,t1_cigbuii,t3_28zdj6,null,1434390782,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3
