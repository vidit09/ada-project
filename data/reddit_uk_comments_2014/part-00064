I don't know if it's because I was more confident at the time but I still feel as though the 08-09 season was the most exciting. Felt horrible to lose out to the Mancs after running them so close, but we were at the peak of a steady stretch of improvement that started with Rafa's first season. Every season we just looked better than the last and I genuinely thought that season we'd win either the Prem or the CL, if not both.

I think perhaps because none of us ever really expected to be in this position earlier this season that I've not come to accept how good we are. We're bloody phenomenal this season and arguably better than that 08-09 team, but I'm so nervous as well.  Perhaps it's because everyone's so close in the table. We could push first one week and be looking over our shoulders at Spurs the next. My heart isn't used to these lofty heights again yet.

City are a tough call, they play well and tear teams apart then they fail to show up and struggle to put games away. Aguero is a big loss to them and if we were to catch either of the two (City/Chelsea) It would be City. 

Arsenal are in for a very very rough month or so, they could either come out of it strong and fighting for the top or sitting behind in 4th.

They all liked football (soccer) and I was introduced-- somewhat begrudgingly-- to the beautiful game via the weekly Sunday night Premier League Review Show and FIFA.  Before this, I didnt like soccer at all, the only matches I had watched were World Cup and I thought it was pretty boring (how could a match end 0-0, etc.).  Those condensed 5-7min versions of matches on the review show are really what caused me to fall in love.  I loved the drama, the fans, the rivalries, and the speed, strength, skill, and tactics.  

Once I was a converted ""football"" fan, it was time for me to pick a team.  My three roommates were supporters of Chelsea, Man U, and Liverpool- so those teams were out.  One of my roommate's older brother was an asshole, that I didnt like at all, and he loved Arsenal.  

So with all those teams out, I did some research (I wanted a club with history) and liked Spurs' style of play.  Also Peter Crouch led me to Spurs.  Since I'm 6'5'', I related to the tall ass Crouchy.

I agree that he might be seen as a bit of a wild card though. Nobody seems to know what his best role is in a midfield, and he does seem to make some questionable decisions in possession (leading to losing the ball sometimes)

I love my job because it's never boring and I get to be there for children and families at a time when they really need support, which I consider a privilege. 

Cuts to staff numbers and resources have had a massive impact on my workload (there used to be 3 people doing my job, now just me) so I do end up bringing work home and doing a lot of unpaid overtime but I still consider myself lucky to have a job that I'm passionate about. 

I have a lot of autonomy in my job. I set my own schedule and prioritise my own workload. I also enjoy working regular hours and having my evenings and weekends free after many years of working shifts. I have recently been allowed to reduce my hours (from 5 days a week to 3 days of my choosing) for childcare reasons. I know many people who have been refused similar requests so I'm quite lucky really.

However looking back over my employement history, a few jobs stand out as being ones that I wouldn't mind doing again:

I worked for a while in the parts department of a motorcycle dealership, everyone working with me was into bikes, we got massive discounts on bikes and accessories, suppliers would take us off for 'training' courses to plug their gear and we got to borrow bikes.  Oh and we sponsered the race-recovery teams for the UK racing circuit so I got to go to a few of the major tracks, and pick up broken bikes in and slightly stunned riders from the track in the works van after each race.  Not to mention having access to the pits.  

Getting to know all the customers was interesting as well, from the born-again-bikers who grew up riding Nortons to the pocket-rocket freaks in £5000 custom leathers to the ageing Hell's Angels.  They all had stories of perfect rides or adrenaline fuelled idiocy.

And I can still tell what size someone's head is without measuring.

A few years later I spent a year running a cardboard compactor for the local Coop distribution center.  I was pretty much left on my own for eight hours a day, to empty cages of cardboard in one end and pull big bales out the other with a fork lift.  It was probably the least stressful job I've ever had, I could do an entire shift on autopilot whilst listening to Radio4 or an audiobook or whatever.  As much free tea or coffee as I could drink, a free canteen and the bloke from the bakery would usually have a baguette or two in the back of his van for me.

The majority of the world's population is in poverty and many are forced to work in low paying jobs providing the 20% or so of the richest people on the planet, including us, most likely, with affordable knick nacks.

I remember the 70s... the sheer dominance, globally respected and loved, bitter hatred at home as we won  everything at a canter... the Shankly debacle.. quiet Bob and his canny brilliance...

Then the 80s were more of the same... King Kenny, Hansen, Neal and Thompson (I should post a pic here of me signed ball from that period).. 

But then came the end of the boot room... Souness ripped it down... Roy Evans tried to redo it but I sat in the stands a lot in those last seasons and the silverware-free head scratching stuff when pass and move became simply pass sideways...

Then Houllier. You can say what you like but he brought us into the modern age. The moment he came out of the tunnel unannounced against Roma in the CL after the heart thing... shivers down my spine just writing it... Benitez.. champs league! Modern methods... all brought crashing down by the Hicks Gillett fiasco, always buying 4th choice players...

Hodgson. The darkest time of all. Not just the lack of pots, but the lack of football and lack of hope. Despair.

The return of the king. Pride. Passion. A heart resuscitated. Passing game returns. Job done. Give praise to the lord, his name is Kenneth.

And then... Brendan. How far we have fallen to appoint this small man, I thought... and then... the old pass and move updated for the modern game... tactics... players playing like they had a plan... big mouths disposed with... owners and manager standing up together... and the football! The speed of those little triangles... the incisive midfield passes that are so clever they seem drenched in Scouse wit... dat strikeforce... Brendan with two fists in the air and he looks like... no, la' don't say it.. don't think it.. not yet.

These are great times to be a Liverpool fan. And it's the best of the last 20 because we have hope.. not hope of a momentary lucky season, but hope for the club, the football and the next season and the season after that...

Basically the government gets to argue ""a witness thought it was you, therefore it was a legit conviction at the time, even though DNA evidence has now cleared you, therefor you don't get compo"".

As compared with a liberal transfusion strategy, a restrictive strategy significantly improved outcomes in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. (Funded by Fundació Investigació Sant Pau; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00414713.).

This paper seems to say that one should be more careful with giving blood transfusions as they don't always help (in the cases they study), but not that it does not say they should _never_ be used.

[Red blood cell transfusion: a clinical practice guideline from the AABB*.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22751760):We examined the proportion of patients who received any RBC transfusion and the number of RBC units transfused to describe the effect of restrictive transfusion strategies on RBC use. To determine the clinical consequences of restrictive transfusion strategies, we examined overall mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, cardiac events, pulmonary edema, stroke, thromboembolism, renal failure, infection, hemorrhage, mental confusion, functional recovery, and length of hospital stay. RECOMMENDATION 1: The AABB recommends adhering to a restrictive transfusion strategy (7 to 8 g/dL) in hospitalized, stable patients.

This paper recommends a more restrictive criteria for when transfusions should be given, based on a large sample of various bits of data.

true,ohdontmindhim,null,null,"&gt; The majority of the world's population is in poverty and many are forced to work in low paying jobs providing the 20% or so of the richest people on the planet, including us, most likely, with affordable knick nacks. Billions have no toilet, running water and struggle to get food and shelter. In the UK millions of people live in poverty and have to do meaningless, insecure work to be able to afford to just keep a roof over their heads and some food on the table.

Once again, what you are saying there is people don't have money. **That is a totally different issue or topic to the statement that money offers opportunities**

If anything, that confirms the statement money offers opportunities, because the majority of the world don't have opportunities, because they don't have the money (or stability/security provided by money) to pursue them. If they did have money, they would have other opportunities and wouldn't ""have to do meaningless, insecure work to be able to afford to just keep a roof over their heads and some food on the table.""

&gt; Even the wealthier echelons chase their money often doing totally pointless or even harmful stuff such as working as lawyers, working in the financial sector or in the fossil fuel industry. All this is down to the fact that people need money to survive and when they have it, they want more.

Again, how is that evidence money doesn't offer opportunities? What you're saying is that even if people have money, some still work - that doesn't change the fact that because they have money, they have opportunities to do other things (like own the cars they want, go on holiday regularly, eat nice food, pay someone to do things they don't want to do like cooking and cleaning.)

I agree wholeheartedly with what you are trying to say, that there is a very big issue with regards to distribution of wealth and the opportunities that people have to be able to earn money, and that is bad, and unfair. However, that is a totally different argument to your original statement that I was contesting, that money doesn't offer freedom, security or opportunities.

Also, have you considered some people like working hard. ""Rich lawyers"" maybe rich lawyers who do ""harmful stuff"" may actually do it, to help people, or because they enjoy their job?

true,IAAA,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"The road here was not fun, I'll be the first to admit.  I'm actually from the US and got my M.Eng then went to law school (eight years total).  I know it's a bit different if you're from the UK, and that in general law school over here operates differently.

Anyway, after I graduated I got a job with a small firm based out of Cincinnati, OH.  I worked for them for almost four years then went corporate.  In general, firms are much more demanding of the time required.  I worked some weeks close to 100 hours a week.  Then some months I averaged 80 hours.  I don't think I had less than 50-55 hours a week of work at the firm.  But you almost have to do that in order to get experience.  It is a trial by fire but you come out very strong.

But after having a child I knew it wasn't for me anymore.  I just didn't want to put in the crazy hours at that point, so I started looking around.  Luckily enough, I signed with a big multi-national and now am based out of Abingdon.

All that said...if you want to do IP law you should.  There aren't a lot of computer science/software dev IP attornies.  Its hard - much harder than engineering was - but the people you get to work with are awesome, the pay is above average for an attorney, and you'd be much in demand.  I normally discourage people who want to go into the legal field.  The exception is if they want to concentrate on patent/IP law.

One caveat.  Make sure you are allowed take the US Patent Bar.  It requires a ""technical"" degree.  They helpfully list all the degrees that qualify.  If you can't or are otherwise ineligible to take that test it's much harder to find a job.  Also, if you want to try it out you can always take the Patent Bar before you go to law school.  I would totally do that, as you'll be a Patent Practitioner without having to be a Patent Attorney.  I think it would open a number of doors for you to at least try out.

To the caveat you mention: taking a look at the USPTO's General Requirements for the Patent Bar, it mentions a residency requirement. So that'd be more of a long-term thing, but it definitely makes sense with the volume of IP that passes through the US patent system. There's an institute for patent attorneys over here, and the European Patent office appear to have a similar qualification, introduced relatively recently, but with an additional requirement for professional experience in patent filing.

true,[deleted],null,null,"As much as I know a lot of you guys love him, I still think he's a liability in defense (Take the Crystal Palace goal for example). In midfield he's good, but I prefer Matic and Mikel as his backup. Him going forward from midfield is not one of his strengths either really. So if a great offer should come, I say we should capitalize on the moment. 

But the fact is that we bought hin for £25m, and we shouldn't be selling for a penny less than £40m. We got them by the balls this time, as we know they need a defender and Thiago Silva and Marquinhos are out of the question. 

David Luiz can be one of the best central defenders in the world sometimes, but his inconsistency is really bad for us, unfortunately. I highly doubt that Luiz will perform in that level on a permanent basis, but hopefully I'll be proven wrong as he's a joy to watch when he's on form. 

I'd say we accept a £40m offer is such a offer should come, use it to buy a proper central midfielder who can break down teams that are parking the bus. Arturo Vidal could be available for £40m-£50m. In my opinion he's the best central midfielder on the planet as of now, and yes - I include Yaya Toure in that equation. If we also buy Luke Shaw for £15m-£25m and Edinson Cavani for £50m+, plus that we sell Marko Marin, Victor Moses, Oriol Romeu and the other guys for a combined worth for some £20m-£40m, I say we could go for the treble!

&gt;Poll Finds British Public Want To Stay In EU

&gt;A new poll suggests that while the British public aren't ready to pull out of the European Union just yet, they would like to see a shift in power away from Brussels.

&gt;According to a new survey by Ipsos MORI, more people think Britain should stay in the EU, but try to reduce its powers, than want Britain to leave.

true,podginater,null,null,"There are quite a few different parameters to consider in choosing a university and between UEA and UCL the differences are stark. 

First thing to consider is money. Living and going to university in London is extortionate and you should be aware that rent rates and general living costs will make a massive difference to your budget. For example club entrances can be £20 and rents even in halls can be upwards of £200 a week. Living in Norwich by comparison could be half as expensive. However depending on where you are from (if you're from the EU, I think), you can get a bigger loan in a London. 

Secondly regarding reputation vs. course, the choice is ultimately yours but which you choose depends on how specialised you want to be in your career. For example, if you get a job that isn't strictly to do with Environmental Studies then generally speaking, I think, UCL will be more impressive to employers but if your employment field is incredibly specialised then perhaps the higher placed UEA will impress them more. UEA is only two places higher in the tables for your course though so the difference might depend on how  knowledgeable your future employer is on the matter. In general UCL is seen as a better university as UEA however accurate that is. 

However the academic differences between the two are minimal in terms of this particular course so what I would focus on more would be the relative quality of life between the two places. London has so much going on which Norwich could never compete with and as you're going to be living there for 3+ years then I think this should be your biggest consideration.

&gt;Financial fair play has already started, in 2011. Since then clubs that have qualified for UEFA competitions have to prove they do not have overdue payables towards other clubs, their players and social/tax authorities throughout the season. In other words, they have to prove they have paid their bills.

&gt;From this current season (2013/14), clubs also have to make sure they break even, which means not to spend more than they earn. UEFA has installed the Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) to verify every year each club's figures of the past two years put together, and as of next season they will look at the figures of the previous three years put together.

&gt;The first sanctions for clubs not fulfilling the break-even requirement will be taken following this first assessment in April or May 2014. The first possible sanctions relating to break-even breaches would be effective for the 2014/15 campaign.

So if I understand that right, unless LFC has failed to pay its debts since 2011, the first results that could end up in a FFP sanction would be those for the current financial year (2013-14) whose accounts will be released next Feb.

Unfortunately, contrary to what the vehemently anti-SNP MSM would have you believe, Salmond is not the leader of the Yes campaign whereas Darling is the leader of the No campaign. The person in the Yes campaign who occupies the equivalent position to Darling is Dennis Canavan and the Yes campaign have always made it clear that Canavan is willing to debate Darling.     

The No campaign do not want a New Labour sell-out debating with someone who is very much old Labour (even if he's no longer a member of the Labour party) particularly as it could convince a lot of die-hard Labour voters that independence is not anathemic to their socialist views as well as showing them that opponents of independence don't give ha'penny toss about the social democratic views which predominate in Scotland. Canavan debating Darling would be massively beneficial to the Yes campaign and, as a result, the No campaign are avoiding that possibility like the plague. 

The No campaign keep calling for a debate between Salmond and Darling because they keep wanting to have the referendum be a referendum on the governance of Alec Salmond and a showdown between the SNP and Labour because they believe that the electorate as a whole shares their antipathy to Salmond plus Scottish Labour are still in outright denial about the 2011 Holyrood elections and current voting intention for the next Holyrood election - I routinely come across Scottish Labour diehards still whining about the 2007 result and they simply pretend 2011 never happened.

Salmond's response to the calls by Project Fear for a debate has been to say ""Yes, I'll have a debate but it should be between me as leader of the Scottish Government and David Cameron as leader of the UK government"". Realistically, Salmond would absolutely kerb-stomp Cameron in any debate. Cameron has disingenuously claimed that he shouldn't have a debate with Salmond because the referendum is supposed to be a matter for Scots alone and as such he shouldn't get involved whilst simultaneously being willing to make speeches and pronouncements against independence.

With pressure from family, law, his solicitors, etc he is now more likely to use these services. A lot of people are stubborn until they have a close call.

Suspended sentences are a good thing. The state gets to monitor the person and ensure that they are taking the correct steps to rehabilitate (in this case, for 6 months) and hopefully not reoffend. 

It is widely recognised that prison in many cases does not help beyond keeping people that are dangerous away from society. Even The inspectorate of Prisons and the MOJ recognise that most of the rehabilitative work that prisons do is done once the person has served their sentence and is then put on licence. 

In this instance if we were to consider the 6 week prison sentence vs. 6 months suspended - His length of punishment has now increased by    almost 5 months. It can also be assessed at any point and extended as well as the inclusions of curfews and exclusion orders from doing certain activities or even seeing certain people.

true,RobertTheSpruce,null,null,"The Jehovahs Witnesses was a cult that started in 1870 in America, as something of a bible study group. They looked at the bible and proclaimed ""Some of this stuff is clearly bullshit!"" They decided that Jesus did not come back to life and that Hell didn't exist amongst other things. They decided that Jesus returned to Earth in 1874, but was invisible.

They then decided that in 1914, God set up Heaven as sort of a base camp for awesomeness, and sent Satan to Earth to basically end the world, destroying everything apart from invisible Jesus and the true believers in invisible Jesus.

Coincidentally the Great War started in 1914. Naturally to much happiness from them. ""Yay! Invisible Jesus is going to be visible Jesus soon!"" they would exclaim. Naturally this pissed off a lot of established religions and governments, and if there's anyone that it's not a good idea to piss off, it's established religions and governments, who promptly made up a law, then threw the leaders of the JW's in gaol for breaking that law. After the war, when the leader got out, he organised a lot of conventions and shit, probably with the tagline ""Here's the *TOTALLY TRUE* info that they threw me in prison for trying to tell you!"" and they decided on a door to door recruiting drive in order to try and save as many people as possible from the maybe happening now, but maybe not apocalypse.

The recruiting drive continued into the 1930s, and to help this they made up a bunch of new rules that they ""found in the Bible"" such as banning blood transfusions and stopped using the cross, ignored Christmas and birthdays. People loved this new and improved cult (maybe is was something to do with saving money on buying presents?) and joined in their thousands. They were considered so mental that the BBC (as well as many American networks) banned them from talking about their stuff on air. This only served to make people more interested. By 1940 they were pushing 100,000 members.

Hitler, on his rise to power quickly decided that JW's were crazy and treated them in the same evil manner that he treated Jews, Homosexuals, Gypsies, and other groups. JW's were the first broadly Christian group to be targeted by Nazis. The Japanese tortured JW's. Eventually being a JW in Germany was outright banned. Canada and Australia also banned them at roughly the same time. Naturally the JWs thought that WWII would bring about the end of humanity. It did not, but with all the shit happening in the world, mixed with all the persecution suffered by cult members, people stated giving them more credibility for their beliefs and were up to a quarter of a million in 1950.

By 1966, (and over 2 million members) which was 45 years or so after their initial ""end of world""  prediction, they decided that mistakes may have been made in the timing thereof, and set another date. 1975(September 5, 1975 to be precise) was declared an appropriate time for God and Invisible Jesus to act, and that Armageddon would definitely happen then. They advised young people not to plan on higher education, because they would not need it in heaven. 

Membership of the JW's began falling on September 6, 1975 for some unknown reason.

Naturally all this world not ending stuff was disappointing, so they sought about changing their beliefs a little (again) and a lot f the JW higher uppers were fired. I mean, predicting an apocalypse, and it not happening is a big no-no in big business.

Several higher members decided that in 1957, the launch of Sputnik ""reset the apocalypse clock"" for 43 years, and so the world would end in 2000. This idea was rejected for being a bit too nutty, so at least they have some limits.

In 1995 they changed their minds again about stuff invisible Jesus had said when he was still visible Jesus. It turns out that Armageddon was scheduled for 2008. By 2010 they decided that the world was not going to end in 2008. They may or may not have set a new date.

Sure, why not for possessing a car (it has a radio), a mobile phone (which has internet connection), in fact why not have a licence for quoting Monty Python or Faulty Towers?

Adding more things you need for a licence doesn't make sense, is not what the licence is meant to pay for, and would drive up costs for everybody. One effect is internet providers would charge more because more people are downloading video.

Yes. Holding your money in a cash ISA at present is making you poorer, not richer. If you're getting less than 1.9% (current inflation) on an investment, it's losing value.

An investment that loses value is not a good one.

true,chilari,eng-shropshire,Shropshire,"Then she is an idiot. On what grounds does she think people should be allowed to descriminate? Doesn't she realise the harm that allowing business owners to discriminate could allow? If you allow businesses to discriminate, then minorities face greater difficulties in obtaining goods and services compared to their non-minority neighbours. If a large number of businesses discriminate against one group, that group then has to travel outside the area to get hold of the same goods, meaning they have to spend more time and money travelling. This saps their resources and means they no longer have equal opportunity to their non-minority neighbours to improve their situation. A system which allows discrimination, therefore, means that those discriminated against - for no better reason than a few business owners won't serve gay people, or brown people, or women - are trapped in unfavourable situations for which they have minimal opportunity to escape them, just because someone won't sell them something.

If the local corner shop refused to top up my gas and electric cards on the basis of my gender, and my fiance was sick with the flu and couldn't go down and buy the stuff himself, then we'd be unable to heat the house, store food in the fridge, cook food and so on - making his health worse and forcing us to buy more expensive precooked food. Just because a business owner valued their autonomy over my right to buy stuff, my fiance's health gets put at risk. Now if that business owner was racist as well as misogynist, we'd have to walk twice the distance, or get in the car, to buy stuff. So we're either out a few quid to pay for the fuel and car maintenance, or I've lost an extra 20 minutes of my evening, once or twice a week, which could have been spent learning to speak German or copyediting someone's novel, and thus improving my ability to earn money. What we're left with is a situation whereby someone else's right to discriminate within their business means I have a harder time earning enough money to get above the poverty line. I pay less taxes, claim more benefits, than I would have if that dick with the shop wasn't a racist misogynist. So it's not just me losing out because I have to walk further, and the business owner losing out because he has fewer customers, but also the whole country loses out because those discriminated against are paying less taxes and claiming more benefits, so there's less public money for other things and the economy is weaker.",1,1394026766,null,0,false,0,cfuxm9w,t3_1zmbdm,t1_cfuxm9w,t1_cfux3fe,null,1432667370,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

On the grounds that it's their business and they don't have a moral duty to do things they don't want to do.

&gt;If you allow businesses to discriminate, then minorities face greater difficulties in obtaining goods and services compared to their non-minority neighbours.

Possibly, possibly not. She's not arguing for discrimination though, she's arguing for the maximisation of choice and liberty.

&gt;A system which allows discrimination, therefore, means that those discriminated against - for no better reason than a few business owners won't serve gay people, or brown people, or women - are trapped in unfavourable situations for which they have minimal opportunity to escape them, just because someone won't sell them something.

That's a pretty ridiculous assertion. Would you shop at a shop that wouldn't serve black people? I wouldn't. If you would then you're condoning their racist attitudes, if you don't, just like I won't and many others won't, they go out of business.

This is airy fairy philosophising.  In practice you'd end up with people being denied access to all sorts of services.  Don't forget most of our infrastructure is privatised now.  Should NPower or Virgin Trains be free to refuse to deal with gay or black people?  

&gt;I personally wouldn't use services which discriminated against people based on racial, gender, or sexual grounds, but I respect their moral right to do so if they so choose.

So much wrong here.  Your idea of voting with your wallet is great if you're mobile and have money to pick and choose which services you access.

THE funny thing for Ukrainians reading foreign press coverage of our revolution and now invasion by Russia is how much nonsense is being written. It really can't be underestimated. It's all very well to bang on about the ""ethnic divide"" here, but — despite appearances — that's not the cause of the revolution; and anyone who thinks it is probably hasn't been to Ukraine since the days of the Czars.

The true cause is far simpler: it's more than 20 years since the USSR collapsed, yet still we live in poverty, we have no rights, our courts are a joke, our hospitals are appalling and the country is run exclusively for the benefit of a few thousand gangsters. We want to be more like Poland and less like Russia — as indeed, and perhaps this is the real issue, do many Russians.

Foreign journalists made similar mistakes in the Balkan wars when they lectured readers 
about the ancient hatred between Serbs and Croats, solemnly recounting atrocities by the 
Ustasha (Croatian fascists) in the Second World War. But the root cause was the opportunism of 
Milosevic in Serbia and Tudjman in Croatia, who deliberately chose to inflame latent antipathies.

It plays very well into the hands of the Russians, who claim that they have entered the Crimea to deliver their compatriots from ""fascist and bandit gangs"". Where are the attacks on Russians (or Jews), where are the huddled masses of Russian refugees? It's like Georgia in 2006 — or the Sudetenland in the 1930s.

Ukrainians just want to live in a proper democracy with a decent chance of prosperity, healthcare and fair treatment, and we refuse to be subjects of Yanukovych, a convicted criminal reputed to have sat on a golden lavatory. Wouldn't you?

For that reason, there were many Russian speakers on our side of the barricades at the 
Maidan protest camp.

And therein lies the peril for Vladimir Putin: if Russians see their cousins in Ukraine can rid themselves of ""managed"" democracy and oppression, might they not get ideas? It is no coincidence that the Russian opposition leader Alex Navalny was put under house arrest in Russia as the invasion started.

Even if Russia's masses don't emulate the Ukrainians, there's a strong chance Kazakhs and Belarussians would. One does not need the mind of Kissinger to see that if dictatorial regimes have fallen like dominoes in the Arab world, so they can in the former USSR.

Putin's dream of a ""Eurasian Union"" that re-creates the USSR would fall apart, and both liberals and nationalists would despise him. All his labours — riding a horse bare-chested, cavorting with tigers, invading Georgia, guiding migratory birds through the heavens — would have been for naught.

The irony is that without this invasion — for now just Crimea — the revolution may well have consumed itself. The Orange Revolution of 2004 ended with Yulia Tymoshenko and Victor Yushchenko falling out. Having prevented Yanukovych stealing the election, they failed so spectacularly that he won the next election. He won't be coming back this time, but there was every chance the leaders of the Maidan would 
make a mess of things again.

Instead, Putin has united us in defiance. We have no idea what lies in store in the next few weeks, but it is clear now that Ukraine's future lies with the west. We can only hope that the west will 
with the west. We can only hope that the west will summon up the resolve to stand firm in ""a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing"".

The US has its flaws when compared with particularly modern and egalitarian western societies, but I'd still argue that American law is highly respected in the grand scheme of things. On a worldwide scale, people that have the same or better rights to free speech, press freedom, public assembly, and (from a more modern perspective) sexual/religious freedom as they do in the US are very much in a minority. I mean, you're right about the career building and political pandering required to throw any weight in the American system, but compare that to the monolith of authority in China, or the corruption widespread through India's representatives (both of which countries arguably have an even stronger oversight between politics and legal process), and America looks pretty good! :P

What about the effects of a system which forbids it?

&gt;It disadvantages those who are discriminated against.

We're all discriminated against, every single day. We currently have legisliation to prevent what the state views as ""unfair"" discrimination. My issue with this is that I don't think anyone has a right to judge for anyone else what decisions they should be allowed to make concerning their own lives, e.g. I do not think you should be allowed to dictate that I like purple, or at least that you should be allowed to dictate that I am not allowed to say I do not like purple.

This is what occurs when we forbid discrimination. Personally I think discrimination based on non-chosen characteristics is generally a negative, however I don't want to force that belief upon others.

I want to allow people to hold their beliefs and act upon them, in as much as liberty is maximised.

You, on the other hand, are arguing against people's rights to hold and live by views you don't like, and wish to force them to behave as you would like.

Now personally speaking, I'm an atheist so these days I don't exactly recieve much religious discrimination. If I'd been born in the 15th century and had said I was atheist I would have been killed because people back then thought it was wrong to not believe in god, even though I'd have been doing no harm to anyone.

These days there are other beliefs we disagree with people holding, and while we don't murder people for holding them, we do forbid them from living by those beliefs even when it does others no harm. I think this is wrong, I think this is anti-freedom, and despite the fact that I disagree with most of the beliefs in question, I will argue for the right of people to hold and live by their beliefs.",0,1394027689,null,0,false,0,cfuxv7v,t3_1zmbdm,t1_cfuxv7v,t1_cfuxpft,null,1432667487,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Oh god...what do you think all of ethics is justified by?

&gt;In practice you'd end up with people being denied access to all sorts of services. 

Possibly. So what?

&gt;Should NPower or Virgin Trains be free to refuse to deal with gay or black people?

Obviously I think that they shouldn't - I'm honestly perplexed that in a thread where I state numerous times that I'm not in favour of these sorts of things people *still* can't get past the difference between desiring the *ability* to make ones choice and using that ability to make (imo) a *bad choice*.

&gt;So much wrong here. Your idea of voting with your wallet is great if you're mobile and have money to pick and choose which services you access. If you're a woman (for example) who can't do this, and your local businesses discriminate against women, you're shit out of luck.

This is a sort of recourse to think-of-the-children counter-argument. Essentially you're creating some horror scenario which is terribly inconvenient. I don't think anyone mature actually believes this would occur, or that as a society we'd let it occur, but whatever, my entire argument stands even with the worst horror situation you can think of.

&gt;Secondly, There's no moral ""right"" to discrimination that I or anyone else has to respect.

Discrimination is choice/differentiation between two or more things. Am I correct to read this as you arguing against all freedom of choice?

&gt;If you think allowing business owners to discriminate at will comes out at a net increase of freedom in society, you're bonkers.

Unfortunately (and I can't say this in any nice way) it's just that you don't really understand the difference between liberty in a moral sense and convenience.

I'm saying that given the choice between someone being allowed to make a choice, and not being allowed to make a choice, the former maximises freedom to a greater extent then the latter.

Given that we're in the sub for the United Kingdom, this entire debate is in the context of the United Kingdom, in which we have money.

This is [correct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herrera_v._Collins#The_decision):

1. A claim of actual innocence based on newly discovered evidence is not cause for a new trial before a federal judge 
2. Only state courts have power to retry a case based on newly discovered evidence of innocence
3. Such a retrial can only occur if there is 'probable innocence' to which a jury would probably find someone innocent based on the new evidence
4. State courts do not have to order a retrial regardless of any new evidence, as retrials are only required in a violation of due process
5. The first trial's results are assumed to be correct, regardless of any new evidence, because a trial ""before a jury of his peers, with the full panoply of protections that our Constitution affords criminal defendants...[found the defendent] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt"" - in other words, a fait accompli; he is guilty because he has been found guilty.",0,1394028787,null,0,false,0,cfuy6q5,t3_1zjl9j,t1_cfuy6q5,t1_cfuvz8z,null,1432667637,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

It seems to take them five minutes to explain a simple concept, and then another fifty to explain it again and again and again. Always with completely irrelevant stock images of blurry lines floating about or unexplained graphs or shots of what the person narrating looks like when they aren't talking or the presenter getting off a train and walking to the next interview. Do I really need to know that the presenter took a taxi? Unless it's a doc about taxis.

There have been a few good ones, no doubt, and they could have upped their game since I last watched it, but I've seen so many amazing documentaries that put BBC 4's to shame. Watch The Imposter or Touching The Void for an account of amazing real life events. The BBC has produced some great docs, such as Planet Earth and Man On Wire, but they seem to pop up on BBC 2 more often than not. (If I remember correctly.) Even films with clear agendas like Bowling for Columbine, An Inconvenient Truth and Countdown to Zero have more crunchy, specific information to inform our opinions than most BBC 4 docs. From character studies like Marwencol, Jiro Dreams of Sushi or Grizzly Man to films on whole organisations like Jesus Camp, Inside Job and Collapse, BBC 4 is left behind in terms of style, impact and sheer information density.

It hasn't sunk to the embarrassing levels of the history channel, but it seems to me that it maintains a respectable viewer base and programme schedule due to an air of intellect, rather than real intellectual content.

As to the good-riddance, I think you're wrong about that. People aren't going to keep paying license fees and satellite subscriptions when everything is readily available online. Television studios are going to have to adapt. I reckon that in the future, there won't be much separating a television studio and a youtube channel.

In the context of the issue regarding the country being too London centric, it exacerbates the issue as it's main sales point is that people can get to London quicker and easier. Rather than addressing the problem that there is so much more money and opportunities in London, constructing HS2 just facilitates and encourages that problem rather than addressing the underlying issues such as there being far to many existing incentives for businesses to move to London IMO.

It is beneficial for the North in some respects though, it all depends on your metrics and preference I suppose.

Yeah that's a cool attitude as long *as you're not the one being discriminated against*.  If you honestly can't see what's wrong with that attitude, again you're nuts. 

&gt;Obviously I think that they shouldn't - I'm honestly perplexed that in a thread where I state numerous times that I'm not in favour of these sorts of things people still can't get past the difference between desiring the ability to make ones choice and using that ability to make (imo) a bad choice.

&gt;This is a sort of recourse to think-of-the-children counter-argument. Essentially you're creating some horror scenario which is terribly inconvenient. I don't think anyone mature actually believes this would occur, or that as a society we'd let it occur, but whatever, my entire argument stands even with the worst horror situation you can think of.

In summary, because you're a stand-up guy and would never make choices like this, no-one else would, and it's immature to think otherwise.  This kind of shit happens all the time - the B&amp;B denying the gay couple use of a room springs to mind.  It's not a recourse to hand-wringing think-of-the-children hypothetical bullshit; it happens already *when it's illegal*, so I have a hard time accepting that people will suddenly all start making the right choices if it's not legislated for. 

&gt;Am I correct to read this as you arguing against all freedom of choice?

Nope, just the ""freedoms"" that infringe on other people's freedom and happiness.  Do and say what you like in private.  Let's be honest, being a bigoted wanker is a ""freedom"" that all societies could live without quite happily. 

&gt;Unfortunately (and I can't say this in any nice way) it's just that you don't really understand the difference between liberty in a moral sense and convenience.
I'm saying that given the choice between someone being allowed to make a choice, and not being allowed to make a choice, the former maximises freedom to a greater extent then the latter. You appear to be arguing the opposite.

Thanks for the condescension, but the point you seem to be missing by a rather wide margin, is that no one gives two fucks (apart from you) about the amount of theoretical ""freedom"" in society; what most of us care about is creating *the most amount of freedom for the most amount of people* in the real world.  Does that mean some theoretical ""freedoms"" of nasty bigoted minorities are constrained?  Of course, but this is not news, and it's how we all survive in Western liberal society every day.

For clarity, let's consider briefly how absolute private property rights breed a totalitarianism State.  Rothbard condemns the State because it ""arrogates to itself a monopoly of force, of ultimate decision-making power, over a given area territorial area"" and yet he is forced to acknowledge that, with private property, ""[o]bviously, in a free society, Smith has the ultimate decision-making power over his own just property, Jones over his, etc.""  Property is a double-edged sword, and private property owners, like warlords, or lords of the manor, or kings or corporations, or States are despots, and their freedom to extract rents from or exclude others inevitably diminishes the freedoms of those others to the extent that they are not also owners of property, in possession of their own tyrannies.

a lot of this is to with culture. i think a lot of young people see a 'media' career as an easy money earner, either it being a singer, media personality, model, or dj etc. Yes great if kids want to do this, but people need to realise that jobs like this are very very rare, and not everyone will get the opportunity. you cant simply do a degree and walk into something like that. a lot of the people in the media strived long and hard and toiled to be where they are today (obviously some haven't but the majority do).

the other side of the coin is the devaluation of the degree certificate. Years ago an office junior, was simply that, a junior school leaver who was to learn the ropes and work his way up. Nowadays a lot of simple office jobs are getting the degree requirement attachment to the job requirements (quite unfairly i think) as employers know that graduates are 10 a penny, and if one person wont accept/pass the low pay/stricter job reqs, they know someone else WILL just to get that opportunity. years ago this wouldn't have happened - less people with degrees would mean that the pay would have increased to attract such people. now this never happens as it is todaY, as the market is saturated with graduates all looking for a chance.

So if you ignore a bunch of content then it has more. Great maths. And if we ignore that content on iPlayer rotates much more frequently than Netflix.

&gt; Sure, why not for possessing a car (it has a radio), a mobile phone (which has internet connection), in fact why not have a licence for quoting Monty Python or Faulty Towers?

Fair enough. A tax on television is better than both of those though because it applies to more people than either of those things. Ultimately the licence fee is a hypoethicated tax levvied on something that effectively the entire population uses - which is why it's paid by more of the population who pay income tax or pay for water (yes, genuinely).

As long as you tax something relatively universal I don't think it matters, though it's probably helpful PR wise to have it somewhat related. But it doesn't have to be - Cyprus taxes electricity in order to fund it's public service broadcaster.

&gt; Adding more things you need for a licence doesn't make sense, is not what the licence is meant to pay for, and would drive up costs for everybody.

No it wouldn't - I'm not advocating that you would need to pay a broadband tax and a licence fee, just that a single licence fee would be payable on the condition of you having either a television, a broadband connection or both.

&gt; One effect is internet providers would charge more because more people are downloading video.

That doesn't make any sense. Why would having to pay a licence fee mean people would consume more video? The number of people who have an internet connection and pay a licence fee today is virtually 100% anyway.

&gt; At the end of the day, we have to go back to the reason why it's licensed in the first place - to preserve the independence of the BBC (fat lot of good now, since government pays a massive share), and to create quality programs. The internet has not affected the BBC in a bad way (as you say, less than 6 figures), so why should anybody using it be forced to pay for something they don't use?

Better to future proof it now before any further issues come along. If we say that the licence fee is effectively a hypotheticated tax on entertainment, then it makes sense from a fairness point of view that anyone who wants entertainment should pay it.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; that people are free to complain about childcare costs and not expect anything. 

But they *are* free to complain and *shouldn't* necessarily expect anything if their complaints are found to be unjustified. 

The fact remains that if you have children, you ought to be fully aware of the costs involved and be able to meet those costs yourself without issue. If you can't do that - I'd question the wisdom in your having children as you can't guarantee you can provide for them and will be putting yourself *and* them through hardship. 

You're free to debate that all you like, it doesn't change anything. Parents - not the state - are responsible for the decision to have children and all the financial burdens that come with that choice. 

Any existing state support is a *kindness* and not for the parents but for the sake of the child. We don't want suffering kids out on our streets or left at home alone because stupid parents decided to have children that they couldn't support. It's a humanitarian effort - it's *not* owed. 

And again - any increase in child care support would no doubt result in raised taxes in some fashion. The money to cover this does not grow on trees. 

Anything else about what society 'agrees with' is irrelevant. People seldom think the big picture through, they just want their immediate selfish concern taken care of.

Our problem is that we are playing with 2 brilliant strikers and we are having a good attacking midfielder in Coutinho.

There is a reason we are conceding so many goals as of late and thats because we are playing Suarez and Sturridge together and have Gerrard in midfield.

true,winter_mute,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"&gt;So you are for allowing people to discriminate in whom they do business with then?

No.  Your take on this only works if *a priori* all ""freedoms"" and opinions are equal.  They are not.  

&gt;That's because you're worried about people ever making the ""wrong"" choices because you want to legislate on choices, which doesn't need to be done here. 

Again, that's not the case.  People make those choices now anyway.  What I want is that any citizen, regardless of race, gender or sexuality has legal recourse when someone makes the choice to discriminate against them on those grounds.  Essentially the ability to appeal to the state to be treated as the equal of the business owner.  

&gt;I think it's immature to assume that Tescos would put up signs saying ""NO blacks"" and that everyone else would just go ""huh"" and keep shopping there, yes.

That's not how it would work though, no-one's going to put up posters, but you would have right wing, well off groups steering boards and committees in companies to engender a system that's comfortable  for people they choose, regardless of the effects on others.  

&gt;Actually this is precisely what I care about, you just don't understand that.

But you also care about allowing the people who would restrict it, the freedoms to do so.  It's a paradoxical position to take, and the crux of it is that the opinions of bigots, racists and sexists are of equal merit to everyone else's on issues of gender, race and sexuality.  Once you dismiss the meritless nonsense they claim as ""rights"" or ""freedoms"", things sort themselves out nicely.

true,MHaaskivi,null,null,"Yeah, in baseball the team has a LOT more control over the player. You don't often see players agitating for a trade, it's much more common for their contracts to expire and for them to move on at the end (kind of like a Bosman). Teams also can trade a player out of their system without any real player consent. So it's easier to build a long-term thing and easier to dismantle a team for rebuilding. In baseball, for instance, Liverpool may look to trade a player like Glen Johnson for a draft pick; the other team gets a player, Liverpool would have an investment in the future.

Obviously none of those mechanisms exist in the Premier League, and because there's such a large market for their services the players have a significant amount of control over where they play. I'm sure you're right, that's a development that has to be IMMENSELY frustrating for Henry.

I wonder why more contracts don't feature really high release clauses, though, as a way to set the asking price in advance of a sale. It would seem that it's in a team's best interest to include a release clause that's above market value, but not so far above market that it's unreachable.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"The criticism came largely from the Villa match and it wasn't Gerrard's fault per say.  He was played in a 2 man middle and expected to be everywhere pressing against a 3 man midfield.  BR got his tactics wrong and made him (and everyone else in the side that day) look bad.  Once we switched back to a 3 man middle for the second half everyone played far better.  He takes some flack for the Stoke match too but that was just a crazy game (I mean come on, 8 fucking goals in that?!).  We were a bit of a defensive shambles there in general and maybe he could've tracked Adam better than he did.  I don't remember a ton of that match other than the scoreline because I got so plastered in the aftermath of it that it basically erased my memory.  He also looked a little off against Swansea in the first half, but it wasn't completely down to him.  I'll explain that more below as it really .

The thing we were all so concerned about when this experiment started was Gerrard's inability to get side to side and cover enough ground to play as a single pivot.  Rodgers has tweaked his tactics brilliantly to accomodate him after a few trial runs though and now he's just organized the midfield in such a way that Gerrard doesn't need to go the whole way and cover touch to touch, essentially creating a niche position for Gerrard specifically.  Henderson is the most key to covering the space over Gerrard's shoulder and when he's able to track back properly we're really solid.  When he's not though, we run into trouble.  Henderson runs box to box endlessly for us and for me is the thing that makes it tick over so nicely.  When things are all working together properly, Coutinho sits just a bit further up than Gerrard and Henderson, which lets Gerrard cheat to his side to cover the space and then Henderson slides in next to him.  It stays nice and compact and then capitalizes on the engine of Hendo to bomb up and get involved in the attack.

The Swansea match is a good example of the trouble we face when Henderson isn't as deep as usual or struggling to recover.  Lots of people were saying that Gerrard had a bad first half and that Shelvey was getting the better of him, but it's nowhere near as cut and dry as that.  Henderson was getting caught very far up the pitch and Shelvey was doing a great job at nipping into the space left between Henderson, Gerrard, and Skrtel to receive the ball.  Skrtel can't step up because then Bony can slide into a gulf of space right in front of the goal, meanwhile Hendo is too far up to make it back.  That means Gerrard has to slide over and when he does that it makes space behind him.  At first Gerrard let Shelvey receive the ball and a few misses/range finders/bad efforts he ended up scoring from it with a brilliantly taken effort.  Gerrard then started to slide over to cover him and it opened up a large pocket of space over his shoulder, which Bony was dropping back into, or De Guzman was making a good run to fill, or letting Dyer cut inside to take it.  Where was Coutinho for this you ask?  While Coutinho presses and defends like a madman in our midfield, the sypical setup of the 3 sees him sit a little further forward than both Jordan and Stevie.  Gerrard cheats a little bit to Coutinho's side because he knows Henderson will cover the other side.  Once Henderson was caught up the pitch a few times, it came unraveled a little bit.

All this about what Henderson does probably really seems to overshadow how brilliant Gerrard has been, so I want to point that out too.  We all know Stevie was never afraid to get stuck in, to the point where for a time his challenges often had a little too much in them during his younger years.  He can tackle and he's a very intelligent player.  He's been prone to lapses in concentration defensively throughout his career, but he's been absolutely amazing to cut that out of his game in he back half of this season.  He seems to have a new hunger to win the ball, rather than just receive it.  And of course there's that magnificent right foot of his as he is the conductor of our attacking orchestra.  Many of our transitional play starts with him, he sets things in motion and puts us on our way.  His assist tally speaks for itself and if he isn't getting the assist he's frequently 1-2 passes back in the attacking move that led to the goal, often the one making the incisive pass to set us on our way.

Some may say that he's just a beard away from a full on Pirlo replica.  For me it isn't quite that way.  Gerrard has much better defensive qualities than Pirlo, but for all the incredible passing of captain fantastic, no one is quite as majestic moving the ball as that stunning Italian beard (and the player attached to the beard is pretty decent too).",0,1394032639,null,0,false,0,cfuziyo,t3_1zmkkz,t1_cfuziyo,t3_1zmkkz,null,1432668268,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,segagamer,eng-Surrey,Croydon,"I can only speak for the Purley Way, Colliers Wood and Kingston branches, but they all had the same issues. I also only worked as a customer service rep/technician (aka part of the in store TechGuys group). Most of my problems were with the Purley Way branch. I don't know how things have changed there since I got fired maybe 5 or 6 years ago (it was shortly before they rebranded the logo and started merging and changing everything), but from my understanding, things have gotten worse, including refusing to let till staff sit down despite them recovering from an operation.

When the extended warranty for computers and TVs changed from a one off fee covering 3 or 5 years to a monthly payment system, they would put bundle the insurance on and discount the price of the item by the amount of the first payment, often without telling the customer, just to make their numbers look better. If the customer was alert enough to notice it, they would come to us (TechGuys dept) and listen to us advise them to call their bank to cancel the direct debit. Naturally, this often led to arguments.

After an item is out of production for a while, or if we're trying to flush stock out, we would price that stock at something ending in 97p. If you held on to it long enough, it would eventually change *to* 97p (I say this to anyone who insists on going to a Curry's/PCWorld. To this day, I'm sure this still happens, so if you see something priced there at .97, it's end of production. Managers or 'certain favoured staff' (usually friends or the staff that served them through the till) will quite often leave laptops, games, etc out the back, as a favour, and on the odd occasion have the price checked on them. Once they hit that .97p mark, they'll buy it. Seeing laptops go from £800+ to £99.97, or software and games go to £0.97 was extremely common.

If said members of staff had a laptop that they obtained through the above method, they would wait until their 1 year warranty is just about to expire, then bring it in. They would then dig out this exposed power adapter we had (the connection head was ripped off and the copper was exposed essentially), and blow the motherboard/RAM sockets deliberately so that they could get it sent off for a motherboard failure (and there is no way to prove that it was intentionally damage). They would then get it sent off, and then because the motherboard was no longer made, they would get a voucher sent back to them to buy a new one of equivalent value in store. This voucher was often more than what they paid for with the £.97 method.

What did I get fired for? In 1 week I got three disciplines. One for being 5 minutes late, one for installing 7zip on a customer's laptop without their permission and forgetting to remove it (I used to use 7zip to easily and quickly extract numerous compressed drivers from the manufacturers website), and one for using a copied version of Windows Vista on a customer's laptop whilst doing a reinstallation of Windows (I did this the legal way however, the original discs product key was not retained, and I used the laptop's product key to activate Windows). This is what led me to the dismissal. In the three or so years I worked there, I never had a single verbal warning or disciplinary, not even about the disc situation (and all the management knew we were doing it) and it was only when I started asking for something more than minimum wage for what I was doing (I think it was £5.75 an hour), I was constantly being promised a new contract but constantly being told that ""we were waiting for our new financial system to kick in"". I was then underpaid despite the extra time I put in, and then when I started to make a fuss about it I was told that I didn't have enough evidence that a manager agreed for me to work those hours, and then, suddenly, the disciplinaries started.

During my appeal, I insisted on being seen by someone outside of the branch, and raised my salary concerns, and also printed off from various Microsoft sources how they actively encouraged it, whilst also stating that PC World as a company did not provide us with the relevant discs required for us to do this ourselves. Their argument was that the customer was supposed to make (or purchase) the specific laptops recovery discs for themselves to bring in. They didn't even look at my paperwork or consider my appeal. The second I raised how staff used to use our internet connection for Pirate Bay downloads or save porno pictures ripped from customers hard drives (sometimes they were from the customer), the hard disk was destroyed out the back before the people from Head Office even got a chance to look.

I didn't know whether to take it to the media or not. I didn't really know whether I even *really* had a case, since I couldn't really prove anything. It was right at the beginning of the recession so *nobody* wanted to risk their job defending me, so I just moved on. I'm glad I did though. I'm in a much better position now than I ever would have been at PC World. I just strongly encourage people not to shop there, or alert them of the things that they do to make sure they're not scammed during a sale (or even go with them so I can say the right things).",0,1394034373,null,0,false,0,cfv08nl,t3_1zjixr,t1_cfv08nl,t1_cfu8jis,null,1432668677,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The confusion is due to something called Annex XI, a rather tortuously worded post-script added to the FFP rules specifically to help clubs comply with FFP in the early years. The most common incorrect beliefs are:

Incorrect FFP beliefs
1	As long as the club is trending in the right direction and the losses are reducing, the FFP test is passed.
2	The wages of all players signed before 1 June 2010 are excluded from the calculations for every season""

There already are Nicorette inhalers which release mist (rather than vapour). If those are ok to use, then vaping should be no different.
Though i agree, there is little study about this. Yet.
Logic dictates that there should be no different effects, but i am no scientist.

Any team would gladly trade less shots and less shots on goal for more goals and it's come under Sherwood thanks to a change in their possession phase mentality and the fine form of Adebayor.

I would only fairly strongly disagree in that your assumption that less midfielders equals less possession is too simplistic and inaccurate. Barcelona and Ajax and teams that emulate their style generally all play 4-3-3 and enjoy high levels of possession, where as the current in form formation of 4-2-3-1 employs five midfielders but is used for both teams that favor possession, those that don't and those that are indifferent to either extreme.",0,1394039690,null,0,false,0,cfv2n3u,t3_1zmjjn,t1_cfv2n3u,t1_cfuyu4j,null,1432669810,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Eriksen who ha played mainly on the wing rates above lennon although i do take your point.



Regardless, the point ive been making is not that Bentaleb is our best entral midfielder - my point has been that considering he is rated by the sub as been our fourth best player under Sherwood he is clearly doing well and that it just draws a nice contrast between this subs attitude towards Bentaleb and his selection(s) and how this sub has actually rated him.

Unfortunately, the cost of living is rising by 1.9% per annum. The fact that your money is rising in value more slowly than that means that you are losing money 'in real terms'.

Simplified example: The superfly pimp hat I want is £1000. I have £1000 saved, but I decide to keep saving it in my cash ISA and buy the superfly pimp hat next year.

One year later, the £1000 in my cash ISA has become £1017, thanks to 1.7% interest. Unfortunately, the superfly pimp hat has risen in price to £1019, because of 1.9% inflation.

I can no longer afford to buy the superfly pimp hat. The longer the time I wait, the wider that gap will get. I am forced to buy a slightly less fly pimp hat, weakening my pimp hand significantly.

If my investment had returned more than the 1.9% of inflation, I would have been able to afford an even more fly pimp hat, increasing the respect given to me by hookers, johns, and other pimps alike.

&gt; Like I said in my original comment, I'm more inclined to side with people such as yourself on the matter, but what if he is telling the truth?

Torres wasn't telling the truth when he said he wouldn't leave in January.

What about Owen?

Sorry, but by and large footballers will say whatever they think they have to in order to appease the fans they play in front of almost every week.

&gt; (that's obvious from here) nor is it convincing anyone involved in the club, so it doesn't make much sense.

Suarez isn't on /r/liverpoolfc, he has stated that he is almost entirely removed from the media apart from the occasional interview.
Again footballers will say what they think they have to, in order to keep the fans onside. 

&gt; If we didn't get CL football, I wouldn't blame him for leaving since he's an exceptional footballer and deserves to be playing at the highest level,

I would, how can you believe what he says and then not blame him if he leaves? So you are fine if it turns out he's been lying to the fans? If he did an Alonso or a Ronaldo and left with a bit of grace then I wouldn't care, but don't tell me he loves the club if he's trying to go to Arsenal.

Suarez is a great footballer, I love that he plays for us, but I don't appreciate the times he's dicked around the club or the fans.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;No. Your take on this only works if a priori all ""freedoms"" and opinions are equal. They are not.

Well, I dislike the plural of freedoms there. Freedom is the ability to choose your actions so long as that doesn't impinge upon rights of others to do the same. You're right all opinions are not equal, but who judges which opinions are more valid than others is extremely contentious and, I'm arguing, should be avoided to the maximum degree possible.

&gt;What I want is that any citizen, regardless of race, gender or sexuality has legal recourse when someone makes the choice to discriminate against them on those grounds. Essentially the ability to appeal to the state to be treated as the equal of the business owner.

Every customer is different to that business owner though. The business owner *owns* the stuff they're selling. If they want to sell it to someone that is their right, but to compel them to do so when they do not want to is unnecessarily restrictive when there is an alternative (do not force them to do anything).

&gt;That's not how it would work though, no-one's going to put up posters, but you would have right wing, well off groups steering boards and committees in companies to engender a system that's comfortable for people they choose, regardless of the effects on others.

That's a pretty ridiculous concept. Non-discrimination is good for business, and that simple fact pretty much takes care of all the right wing capitalists you're worried about.

&gt;But you also care about allowing the people who would restrict it, the freedoms to do so.

But they're not. They're not restricting anyone else's freedom, they're just choosing not to take part in a consensual act. You're making that act non-consensual on their part. My way has two people making a voluntary transaction, your way has one person making a voluntary transaction and another making an involuntary transaction. I don't get how it is not clear that this is a net reduction in free choice based on our dislike of someone's opinions or beliefs.

&gt;Once you dismiss the meritless nonsense they claim as ""rights"" or ""freedoms"", things sort themselves out nicely.

Aren't you lucky to live in a time where the majority happen to agree with your views eh?

Personally I think allowing for as many people to live their lives in the way they want is the best thing we can hope to achieve in terms of tolerant behaviour, but evidently you feel justified in imposing your beliefs upon others.",0,1394042511,null,0,false,0,cfv3zwc,t3_1zmbdm,t1_cfv3zwc,t1_cfuz7cw,null,1432670461,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

For me Rooney in an attacking mid position would be great. He'd have Henderson beside him, Gerrard behind him. That midfield would have a great balance of pressing, creativity and attack. Sterling to the right of Sturridge with one of Lallana, Oxlade, Walcott (when fit) to the left. That attack would be deadly and fast. 

In defense I actually think England would have a better CB partnership (or if not better, more stable) than Liverpool. Their full back options are as good as, if not better than Liverpool's. He could go with Johnson and Flanno for the sake of familiarity, or potentially upgrade on them by throwing in any of Shaw, Baines etc. 

To be honest that is a really strong lineup. Imagine what Rodgers could do with the England squad. Granted, most managers wouldn't set up their team the same way for an international knockout style tournament as they would for a 38 game round robin.

So, 500 years ago you couldn't be atheist. That view point wasn't allowed, and freedom was diminished. Now, you can't hold views the majority don't like and operate a business, so freedom is diminished. You're saying that's OK because you don't like those views, and I'm just saying that it's the same principle as what they did 500 years ago, diminishing freedom because we as a society don't like a viewpoint.

There was no need to burn atheists, and there is no need to stop business owners from serving who they like. It might make people unhappy to know that there are atheists out there, or that they can't shop at whatever shop, but it doesn't actually do them any more harm than if that atheist or shop had never existed in the first place.

true,tusksrus,cnty-uk,Manchester,"&gt;But given the choice of compromising on the pledge or throwing the coalition in the bin I believe they made the right choice.

Now you won't find a bigger Lib Dem supporter than me (well, you might), but was it really a choice between the two? I still think that they did basically the right thing and that the new deal for students is possibly better than the old one - but they could have made a bigger show of resisting that. It was a huge display of political naivete from the Lib Dems to compromise on that so early on, particularly when they also compromised on the AV referendum (ie it wasn't PR), the whole thing had a massive air of disappointment which contrasted so very strongly with the ""Cleggmania"" of the week after the first debate on ITV.

It's a massive issue the Lib Dems have - they argue more strongly than anyone in favour of coalition governments (obviously they have an interest in the area), but I wonder if they are actually ready for national government. Their political machine is based on concentrating on one constituency at a time, and they seem to have trouble getting their message across nationwide. They've done a lot of things that they promised to do in their manifesto, and have prevented the worst of the Conservatives, but still four years on people are under the impression that the Lib Dems haven't delivered anything and broken all their promises. Of course, if you ask them to name one, they'll say tuition fees. If you ask them to name two, I bet most people couldn't.

This is partly because, I think, for at least the first half of the government they weren't able to strike a balance between appearing united and being honest about the disagreements that go on behind closed doors. If a unpopular-with-the-left policy emerges from Downing Street, people assume that the meeting went ""So Clegg we've got a new policy, if you're claiming disability benefit you have to pay to get your legs amputated to prove it."" ""Okay boss."" (or whatever), whereas in actual fact there was probably some disucssion where the Conservatives wanted something ""worse"" and the Lib Dems were able to take the edge off.

true,theterminizer,num24,,"I've told my story before, but here goes again. I'd tried in vain to get into an English team for years, but I couldn't find the passion. I had no connection to any team, no reason to support someone, and a strong aversion to glory hunting. For the longest time, the only foreign team I supported was Wrexham because both sides of my family originally came from Wales (my father's side from Wrexham where a street bears our surname) and I'm one of those typical Americans who identifies with where his ancestors came from. For the same reason, I'd watch the Welsh national team whenever I could. 

I first saw Gareth Bale when he singlehandedly won the friendly against Scotland. I was watching live at my desk at work and it was all I could do to keep silent. He amazed me with his skill and I loved that a Welsh player was legitimately one of the best players in the world, so I really took a liking to him. This was just after Clint Dempsey joined Tottenham so now you had a team with the best Welsh player and probably the best American player, plus Brad Friedel, so it was a no-brainer. I played a lot of FM and FIFA as them and watched the games when I could, so that over the 2012-2013 season I became a pretty big Spurs fan.

Fast forward to last summer. I'm planning my first ever trip to Great Britain, and I get tickets to Spurs' home opener (and to see Wrexham and the Edinburgh derby, which were both a blast). When I got the tickets, Bale and Dempsey were both on the team. By the time I got there some two months later, they were both gone (and Dempsey went to Seattle, the team I hate more than any on the planet - it was like a dagger through my heart). I was pretty crushed. But I'd also spent a year getting to know the entire squad and for the first time I really felt attached to the team. So I stuck with them (it's not a choice, really, either you want to follow a team or you don't, you can't force that kind of thing), they won the opener on Soldado's PK, and I've continued watching them whenever they're not playing at 4am. I feel a little silly being so attached to a team I've seen once and have no real connection with, but sport is inherently irrational, so whatever.

true,TheMysteriousShadow,lfc68,,"&gt; No one forced him to bite Ivanovic.

I was speaking more of the racial incident with Evra; the man was effectively branded a racist by the media for weeks, then banned for an inordinate amount of games based solely on Evra's testimony. It doesn't matter whether you're getting paid millions or not, he's human and you could see that he was hurt by that situation. 

&gt; but **by and large** footballers will say whatever they think they have to in order to appease the fans they play in front of almost every week.

That's the important phrase here. Using any other footballer as an example doesn't work since Suarez himself hasn't done that to us, and they're all individuals with different outlooks. We'll see come the end of the season which way his priorities lie. 

&gt; Suarez isn't on /r/liverpoolfc, he has stated that he is almost entirely removed from the media apart from the occasional interview. Again footballers will say what they think they have to, in order to keep the fans onside.

My main point -- despite it being ill-written -- was that, if Suarez had every intention of just leaving, he's certainly over-stretching his lie (this interview is probably the fifth I've seen since Christmas in which he pledges his love and faith in LFC for the foreseeable future). Maybe it's just me, but that kind of overkill makes no sense. 

&gt; I would, how can you believe what he says and then not blame him if he leaves? So you are fine if it turns out he's been lying to the fans? If he did an Alonso or a Ronaldo and left with a bit of grace then I wouldn't care, but don't tell me he loves the club if he's trying to go to Arsenal.

I didn't say that I believed him any more than you did, just that maybe it's about time we showed a little faith in his word and weren't so pessimistic every time his future comes up in interviews. Of course I'd be devastated if he left after pledging dedication to the club, and I'd hate that he lied about it, but I'd also understand that (in the hypothetical situation that we don't achieve CL football) he wants to be playing for the best teams and we haven't provided that. 

I understand all your points, and I'm not meaning to argue but just provide talking points about each other's opinions.

What i am saying is not everyone using the foodbanks are truly in poverty (through no actions of there own, purely circumstance) while others are there purely because they have no money left to buy food after paying for the latest Games console and TV on credit, or by Payday loan repayments.

Indeed by breaking down the reasons WHY people are using foodbanks you can start to understand what can be done to help them.

For example, if there are hundreds etc using them becuase their money is being used to pay back a pay day loan they had to take out to fix a car that got them to work (being the one bill that pushed them over the edge) then you could start asking 'Why has someone who got pushed over the edge been brought so low by a payday loan (esp when you may discover they had borrowed £200 and paid back over £1000 with no end in site)

By gathering information like this you start to see the bigger picture, rather than (as you put it) ""Buying into the lie that poor people are feckless wasters""

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;What justification is there for this concept of ""commons""

That rather depends on exactly what you're asking.  The exact historical position obviously varies from place to place and time to time.  Clearly, in the UK, there was a real historical time when real historical commons existed with real rules governing their use to prevent over-exploitation (so much for the over-used and under-proved myth of their 'tragedy').  These were _really_ historically stolen (albeit often in a legalistic fashion).  If we go further back historically, we can easily demonstrate that _all_ private property ultimately derives from theft, indeed mostly from violent robbery, usually in the form of conquest, murder, genocide, etc. sometimes from trickery and fraud. 

But ultimately, taken to its logical extreme, if there is no commons, each new human is born a trespasser in the world, and if private property rights are strictly enforced, they are either a slave or an outcast to be cast out into space.

You'll have to elaborate on the second point, I'm not sure I follow.  Do you mean the right-wing libertarian argument that taxation is theft?",0,1394048564,null,0,false,0,cfv6z0e,t3_1zmbdm,t1_cfv6z0e,t1_cfv5qwv,null,1432671850,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Why are people debating?  Because they're uninformed, they're scared; and they have every right to be because the establishment has been fueling misinformation and have been using fear of large change to justify their EU political project mission creep.

Trade will not be an issue.  Not only do we already have parallel trade agreements signed outside the EU with the single market, we also have legal assurances through the WTO and the Lisbon Treaty itself.  It is absolutely in everybody's interest to continue trading.  As such the spurious '3 million jobs' claim just doesn't stand up.

&gt;The evidence that he's dishonest is what

He can't be honest about his intentions in a debate about the EU and come out in one piece.  If the words 'post-national' or 'federal', or 'united states', followed by the words 'EU' or 'Europe', come out of Clegg's mouth in a UK debate then he's toast.  There is no support for it.   We know this is his position because the Lib Dems align themselves with the ALDE, but Clegg can't be seen to join those two dots lest he falls at a Ballot Day Massacre.

The ALDE didn't say something bad that didn't sit well.  It's more a mission statement.  They actively set up a federalist pressure group.  The leader of the ALDE is co-president of it.  This isn't some minor disagreement over small potatoes.  It's fundamental, and we have video of Nick Clegg standing front row center stage giving an ovation to the chief ALDE federalist as he laid out his vision.

Clegg's option is to either come out as a post-national UK federalist and lose, or to literally duck and cover whilst trying to capitalise on the negative bogey man of what a Brexit means.

I'm more libertarian on the issue and issues like this. To me, its better to have the option to fuck up than to be told not to do something because it's bad.

Now don't get me wrong, this only applies to a certain extent - society needs to protect itself and state intervention is needed to the extent that it protects the majority. 

But with weed there's not all that much to discuss - those who want to smoke it already do. And with legality it allows for proper regulation and the right support infrastructure to develop. 

Currently we have a situation that doesn't allow for production restrictions and doesn't allow for an age limit that can enforced and basically just gives a multi million pound industry to the black market - it's senseless.

Back in 1995 my use of a hand held scanner, an incriminating photo of a classmate and an 'email entirely school address list' function got the newly introduced email system shut down the year after it was launched.

I was once at the receiving end of abusive phone calls to my landlines from people at school. Back in those days (~1996) there was no private number blocking, or individual mobile phones, and I was incredibly frustrated my family and I couldn't do anything about it.

These days I'm a technophile (and IT pro) who mostly keeps on top these things, but this won't always be the case.

Every year some new technology will be launched, and new ways of abusing this technology will be discovered, before the accountability and safety processes are in place.

Personally I'm fed up for the reactive nature of education and especially media coverage. X gets popular. X is used by kids in the way that X always has. Media goes nuts. Calls to ban X, ban is ineffective. [Relevant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1289/)

I consider it impossible for a typical educated person who is not an IT pro to pro-actively manage their child's use of technology.

How does this not impact equal rights?

A bus company decides black people are not allowed to ride the bus, or must ride in the 'ethnic' section. Should this be allowed? You're cool with that, right? No problem. 

Signs go up in shops: ""No blacks or homos."" That's cool with you, right?

Perhaps you don't think that would happen? Because no one's racist or homophobic over here, right?

Sure, some people may well boycott the company. Enough to make a difference? Not if there's no other bus to take to work.

Travel lodge declares that men and women can only get a room if they are married, as they have decided they are a christian company. Muslims are also not allowed.

Is that cool?

Are you happy with that? Sure. Why wouldn't you be. 

You'll 'boycott' the company. But in the meantime who is losing out?

Certainly not me. I'm a white male, in my 30s, reasonably well paid and perhaps falling into what some might arguably deem 'middle class'. I'll be fine! I have a family and everything. No skin off my nose.

But there will be many minorities who will not be so lucky.

Parents and Grandparents simply have no idea.  

I showed her how within 5 minutes, I linked one online account to another until I found out where she lived.  She (and later her mother) was ""shocked"".  I managed to bring up things she posts when she was even younger (it was quite funny seeing how embarrassed she was).

Then again I'm an 80's baby so all online communication was done with a handle.  I've tried to explain to her that she shouldn't link to her real life as much as possible and only communicate with people she links on social media sites (facebook etc).

My Reddit account pretty much allows someone to identify who I am, but I'm aware of that.  I've allowed that and controlled that information.  

The thing with being bullied online is that it's really easy to find out who's doing the bullying.  It's not like most young teens are smart enough not to leave a trace.  I showed her how to search for people online (linking various accounts).

I'm not sure if bullying will ever stop, I can't help but think it's part of growing up.  Children learning how to interact etc.

I also told her to try and knock the shit out of her bully.  Not that this is always the answer, but the bullying was reduced to where it's not even an issue anymore.",0,1394051314,null,0,false,0,cfv8d2c,t3_1znd3f,t1_cfv8d2c,t3_1znd3f,null,1432672573,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

I think it can scale well. I work for an enormous organisation and things aren't always done right. 

However with proper oversight people can recognise when something isn't right and take it out of the chain to fix it. You can also install points at which someone manually checks things for sanity. 

As things scale up you need to scale up the checks and balances accordingly - it doesn't even need to be a linear scaling, the bigger it is the less oversight it needs.

I think large organisations are very well aware of how expensive it is to handle things by hand, especially if you can force the customer to go through hoops and sort it themselves.

If you look at ebay or amazon for example they are intentionally designed to stop you complaining effectively and to make sure you have to try and fix it yourself first - after all my time costs them nothing.

The bigger something is the bigger the number is that you think you can make a saving on.  I remember early in my working life the office manager told me how much we spent on pens. It's always struck me as a monumental example of stupidity. If we spent £100 a year on pens it's because we were doing millions of turnover.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;  If the words 'post-national' or 'federal', or 'united states', followed by the words 'EU' or 'Europe', come out of Clegg's mouth in a UK debate then he's toast.

I agree with this. We're in the EU because of our geographical location, to deny that is stupid. 

The thing is, we do have more in common with Australia, New Zealand, the US, Canada.. these are English speaking nations for a start. They have a similar, if not better quality of life than our own. Entering a federal union under the EU as a 'united states of Europe', would reduce our quality of life as we'd have to increase other peoples. This is something the general public would not back, a country can stand on its own two feet without us propping it up, just as we are. 

Furthermore, the basic fact that we do not share a lot in common with Europe on a culture level.. is another reason why this isn't working as well as it should. I work in sales and find it easier to make a 'connection' with Aussies or Americans.. it just feels so less forced than to talk to Mr Patel, who keeps calling me 'sir', rather than 'mate'. And Europeans who love to argue before I've even transferred them to customer services and away from the sales department about a bill they've got. But it's racist to think this way! Lol, the general public vote honestly and UKip resonate with that. Political correctness doesn't matter if you've observed and experienced how cultures are a lot more different in foreign speaking nations, rather than English speaking ones. Political correctness cannot deny the truth. 

I honestly think that this debate will be the nail in the coffin for Cleggs career. There is literally nothing Clegg can possibly say to make the EU shine in a good light. 

Free trade will exist when we're outside the EU, even if it doesn't, they cannot annex us, so trade will continue as I'm sure Nokia and Audi want to sell here. Our immigrants who are retiring in Spain, taking with them LIFE SAVINGS I'm sure is money Spain will still want.

&gt;That's a pretty ridiculous concept. Non-discrimination is good for business, and that simple fact pretty much takes care of all the right wing capitalists you're worried about.

Discrimination has nothing to do with how well business does; they're success is generally just tied to what the regime lets them do.  AEG did pretty well out of supplying gas ovens for Auschwitz - businesses that are happy to discriminate can do just as well when conditions are right; and if you remove the legal protection from minorities, the chances are much better that those conditions will come round again.

&gt; don't get how it is not clear that this is a net reduction in free choice

It's a net reduction because even if we're talking like for like; one business owner can refuse to serve an entire community; that's his or her ""freedom"" exchanged for all theirs. 

&gt;Aren't you lucky to live in a time where the majority happen to agree with your views eh?

I'm lucky I live in these times, you're lucky you live in these times. 

&gt;as many people to live their lives in the way they want is the best thing we can hope to achieve in terms of tolerant behaviour, but evidently you feel justified in imposing your beliefs upon others.

This is great, but anyone with any time on this planet knows that a great many people are intolerant dickheads.  The nature of our representational government means that we all have to sacrifice some freedoms to maximise everyone's real freedom; to get them educated, to raise the general standard of living, to keep crime rates down.   If we trusted everyone to do what they wanted, it'd be complete anarchy.

I don't feel justified in imposing my beliefs; but as a collective society, yeah I totally agree with proscribing the most repulsive elements of human nature where possible.",0,1394052377,null,0,false,0,cfv8wu9,t3_1zmbdm,t1_cfv8wu9,t1_cfv3zwc,null,1432672831,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"The Leveson Report seemed to succeed in something. The most read newspaper in the country was shut down, the CEO of one of the largest media organisations in the world stepped down and was humiliated by the commission, some major editors are facing jail time and the government has set up a new regulation authority (which might turn out to be good or bad). It made the story stay on the front pages throughout the commission.

The Iraq Inquiry allowed a lot of people to be called to explain themselves including Tony Blair and the only reason it has had less of an impact is because the government vetoed the release of the report because presumably it is highly embarrassing and so critical of the government that even the opposing party doesn't want it released. It clearly was not a government whitewash. 

What about the Saville Inquiry which investigated Bloody Sunday - that produced a public acceptance of guilt and official apology from the government and compensation to the victims. Again, no whitewash.

Their game against Brazil cemented how great the sport is for me. What a game!

Fall of 2010, I studied abroad in Iceland, and became friends with an Irishman and an Italian who were big fans. My Irish friend was a huge United fan, and my Italian friend followed Inter and Chelsea. I was constantly going to bars with them to watch the EPL, and it was easy to fall into supporting United, simply because they won all the time and had some good players.

After returning home, I still followed United closely, but over time realized it was kind of lame to follow the ""team that always won."" So I started watching other teams, and immediately fell in with Spurs. Bale, Modric, Rafa. Players we all know, love, and miss dearly. I've always thought Redknapp looks like a muppet, so I was drawn to them as well because of how comical he can be. 

I was just drawn to the general atmosphere of the club. A club that has always been in the EPL, had some glory days, and was just recently cracking back into the top. I remember watching the insane CL games against both Milans and being completely gripped.

Since then, I've become quite accustomed to the roller coaster ride that is associated with Spurs, this season being no exception. But the tough times make the good ones all the sweeter.

Revise. Revise, revise, re-fucking-vise. You'll have no idea how valuable 1 minute of revision could be until you walk out of the exam hall. 

Know case studies. For some subjects this might not be relevant, but for some it's quite handy. Being able to apply what you know to something that's happened/happening in the world is a good thing to have at your advantage. Lessons such as RS (we call it Philosophy though) and History. 

Learn keywords. 

Don't just revise, but check YouTube for lessons teaching you about how meiosis happens, or why medical development went through a stage of regress during the Middle Ages. The Internet is a wonderful thing and can benefit you greatly with your studies. 

Don't take time for granted. I'm in Year 11, and my coursework is due in soon for my subjects. It's not just the exams that you need to get right, but it's the coursework too. Don't just think ""ah, that can wait!"" Because chances are, it'll all pile up and stress you out. Plus, when you get your coursework out of the way you can focus on the exam(s) for that subject. 

Learn how to answer questions. There's a formula for getting top marks in pretty much every question. In Physics it would be to show what equation you used and the answer you got to get 3 marks (including the units). Showing your working can get you the extra marks if you made a mistake. For questions like 6 marks, you obviously need to make 6 points, or 3 points and expand them. Learn the formulas for answering questions and you're almost guaranteed to get top marks. 

Learn the exam boards and do past papers.

true,_Madison_,eng-warwickshire,Warwickshire,"Firstly im not arguing about the health benefits from removing tar, its clear that will save thousands of lives and e cigs have the advantage. E cigs and vaping kits built around replacing cigarette consumption deliver nicotine at similar levels and at lower levels nicotine is pretty safe. 

The big problem is there have been no long term tests on on very high levels of nicotine consumption you can easily achieve with a vape pen which far exceed nicotine intake with cigarettes. 

There have been no studies about nicotine absorption and effects from vapour vs smoke. Its not actually known how much nicotine is present in the vapour, there have been no peer reviewed papers or studies done on it at all. Its possible the vapour contains far more nicotine than is present in cigarette smoke.

Lastly there is very little regulation about what is actually in these oils, at present in the US at least the ingredients do not even have to be printed on the label and again no testing has been done on their safety. UCSF has done tests and found several dangerous chemicals in vape oils ( https://www.tobacco.ucsf.edu/10-chemicals-identified-so-far-e-cig-vapor-are-california-prop-65-list-carcinogens-and-reproductive ).

At present i could start mixing vape oil myself and selling it completely legally even though i have no training and have done no tests on its safety. These need to be regulated and tested properly to ensure they are actually safer than cigarettes. They also need to be regulated to ensure the product is of a high quality and that they are a decent alternative to traditional smoking and not being used for serious high intake nicotine intake. What's especially troubling is its clear that e cigs are not 'just vapour' and co contain harmful substances, yes they are at lower level than cigarettes but they are still there and so sales restrictions should be implemented to restrict sales to minors etc. ",0,1394054452,null,0,false,0,cfv9zs5,t3_1zmaox,t1_cfv9zs5,t1_cfv7gxn,null,1432673345,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Is there something they could done something to avoid that, do they have complete control over the mindset they grow into, or is it influenced by outside factors?  I think even if it is all their fault, should be trying to improve their quality of life once it reaches a certain point regardless of whether or not they're responsible.  And rather than simply punishing or sanctioning them, accepting it as a failure on society's part and focus on preventing more people from going into excessive amounts of debt rather than focusing on the small minority that already are.

Let's not pretend we live in a utopian society where everyone can get everything right.  I'm not saying people shouldn't suffer the consequences of their actions, just that there's a point where you just ignore it and help them.  If you think that anyone who not only thinks they can't manage to afford to feed themselves, but is also referred to a foodbank by a doctor or counsellor isn't at that point...I'm not really sure what to tell you.  What else can they do beyond that, educating them and hoping it doesn't happen again?  People need to eat.  The only real alternative is we wait until they turn to stealing food and end up paying for them to stay in prison.

Rather than lay all the blame on them we should educate people on being financially responsible when they're in school.  A child can't help it if their parents won't teach them the value of money.  Nor can we realistically expect them to teach their children if they haven't learnt it themselves.

I grew up playing hockey and baseball, and so this was my first real exposure to the beautiful game, and I fell in love. I cheered on my hometown MLS team (the Vancouver Whitecaps) during their season, but I realized I loved the game so much that I needed to find other teams to support. 

Some teams fell to me naturally (I was a German exchange student and Munich was my favourite city, so it was natural to root for Bayern Munich), but for the EPL I had to spend some time looking at the different teams before deciding who to root for. Here was my decision making process:

- I didn't want to bandwagon hop onto a perennial champion (Man U etc.)
- I didn't want a team that was buying its way to the top
- I didn't want a team that was threatened by relegation
- I wanted a team in a nice location should I ever get to visit.

Tottenham was one of the first teams on my shortlist, and it didn't take long after being exposed to them that I realized Hotspur football was where I belonged. The passion of the supporters, and the vitality of the team are nearly unmatched, and it's thanks to people like those in this sub that I became a fan.

During a full D-T experimental campaign in 1997 JET achieved a world record peak fusion power of 16 MW which equates to a measured gain Q, of approximately 0.7. Q is the ratio of fusion power produced to input heating power. In order to achieve break-even, a Q value greater than 1 is required. A self-sustaining burning plasma requires at least Q=5 (since the alpha particles carry one fifth the fusion energy) and a power plant requires at least Q=10. As of 1998, a higher Q of 1.25 is claimed for the JT-60 tokamak; however, this was not achieved under real D-T conditions but extrapolated from experiments performed with a pure deuterium (D-D) plasma. Similar extrapolations have not been made for JET, but it is likely that increases in Q over the 1997 measurements could now be achieved if permission to run another full D-T campaign was granted.

Currently, the UK gives the option for workers to opt out of the 48 hour work week restriction, but the other rules still apply.

Even though we would probably keep that directive, I wouldn't trust the current Conservative government and UKIP to stick to it and I bet they'd eventually erode the rights of the worker, given the huge business interests behind both parties.

Also given the current state of affairs with human rights (spying, arresting journalists on terrorism charges, extradition to countries that torture people), the European Court of Human Rights sounds like a nice thing to have just to solidify what we already have.

For maths i actually have this neat maths CD by Mathswatch that has videos and tutorials and theory on everything from D to A*, with practice questions,that has helped a ton.
Also, as for coursework i have almost finished all of it. Done my english, geography, science(we take science and additional science, not science for each individual subject), almost finished my history.
Also, having the motivation to do things,like hours of revision at a time, seems a pain. I have done notes for most subjects though(which i used for mocks) which i can use and expand on for the real exams.

Later on in 10s run, this began to blur slightly, and inevitably found its way to the master, his own race. Though it could be argued the master wasn't evil, in my eyes he was. 

Next up is 11. And the evils begin to become much more unknown to the doctor. The evils that begin to exist many times are caused by the doctors own actions, he creates his own evils. Many view him as an evil in the universe, and end up throwing him in the pandorica even. The silence forms, with the sole purpose of destroying the doctor in the thought of saving the universe from his own destruction.

I'm doing what I do.. and I don't know why. I'm sure you can tell me that I'm living my life drinking, to get by from working. And working, because our inadequate system of labour requires me to go to work sick to show that I'm dedicated. 

I just work hard because I want more money, I want to own a lovely house in a middle class area. Sadly, it isn't my generation who benefits from cheap housing being readily available. The movement the EU gives us puts greater strains on our housing. It makes it more expensive for me. 

The rules about not being able to do a 24hr shift, seem a bit mad. I'd never require any of my employees to work for 24hrs. If one came up to me and said 'can I just clock off when I need to clock off', if we were getting particularly battered and were open 24hrs, I'd say 'yes'. Then let him work however long he could, as he asked and he's old enough to decide how long he can work. Law shouldn't deny somebody what they want to do in a working environment. Especially smaller businesses, who may be struggling and pull together as a team. 

Business is business, looking at the harsh factors of how people spend money and how you can acquire it. If I push to fuck in work, show my upper management to be completely inadequate and push them for a greater work rate, then raise that myself and thus, get promoted and see them demoted.. although they may have kids and a mortgage and I'm a single male. Should I feel guilty? Or should I recognise I'm the better man for the job/company/more adequate? 

Going back to your point about EU law, if it genuinely benefits our population to have certain policies still in place, keep them, it's not rocket science to be for that. However at the same time, it shouldn't hurt our drive, or the entrepreneurship that naturally drives smaller populations to be as influential as they are, on the international stage.

true,Bananasonfire,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"I've said it once, I'll say it again. The laws aren't there to punish workers. They exist to stop businesses exploiting their workers and forcing them to work numbers of hours that are detrimental to their health. Overtime is perfectly fine, but it has to be voluntary and you as a business owner cannot force your workers to do it. You may not want to, but some business owner is going to want to do that, and that's why the protections exist. This is especially true for non unionised workers, who don't have collective bargaining and basically have to shut up and deal with it. 

The rules aren't so restrictive on the worker as they are on the businesses themselves. Another example would be the Working Time Directive's rules on night work. Workers are entitled to provide health assessments before and after night time work, which can be covered by the NHS. Workers with health problems who work night shifts can be moved over to day work if they choose to.

Honestly there's a lot of words involved in that directive, and that's just one of them. I'll link it and you can read it in your own time, but from what I've seen of it, I can't see why stuff like that would be a bad thing for the workers specifically. Even then it allows countries to make some changes, since directives aren't laws by themselves, rather instructions for member states to write up laws with these guidelines in their own countries.

I do appreciate that UKIP doesn't include death camps nor invading Poland in its manifesto but then neither did the Nazis in 1933.

I think people who support Ukip think either 1) they'll never get in so it's nice to have them as an influence on the main parties or 2) if they get in they won't become more extreme.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"To be honest, I don't think so, no. I actually think an issue strengthening the squad over the summer is that we've basically got zero scope to build some reasonable transfer funds from player sales. Unless Suarez leaves for big money, pretty much everything will have to be covered by regular club revenue (obviously CL football will help there) or FSG.

Reina, maybe we'll get a couple of million for him. Goalkeepers don't command huge fees, he's 31 (less of an issue for a goalie but still, he's getting on a bit) and clubs know we're looking to ship him out which will hurt the asking price.

Assaidi we only paid £2.3m for, and there's absolutely nothing he's done at the club or at Stoke that would lead me to believe his value has gone up much since then.

Borini I could see us getting some OK money for, but even then I think we'd be lucky to get more than the £10m we paid for him. And to be honest I'd say if he's happy being a squad rotation striker at Liverpool it might be worth our while to just keep him. 

Agger would be the only other person from our squad that I think we could sell for more than a couple of million without hurting the quality of our starting XI, and even then that's assuming we'd have another CB for cover. 

It is worth noting that in 12/13 we only sold £8m of players, compared to £21m for 11/12 and £28m for 13/14. Purchases are a bit weird because they're spread out over the length of the player's first contract under FFP (to stop clubs mass-buying one year and totally tanking that year's FFP criteria to then be completely fine for the next 5-6) but we've consistently been spending around £50m on players every year for the last three years (and £80m in 10/11 which will start to come off the books soon). So in that sense we're already around £20m better off for the current season in transfers compared to the figures just released for last season.

Gerrard, in his silence about it, basically stated that he wanted to leave the club in that horrible period that is, thankfully, behind us. I didn't, and don't, believe he's this antagonistic figure that you seem to think Suarez is because he's a player and he was confused. Whether or not he changed his mind, or had is mind changed for him, is neither here nor there: at one point, he was uncertain about his LFC future, which is the situation Suarez found himself in. The only difference is Gerrard didn't do an interview to say he wanted to join Chelsea but, again, that's rather irrelevant in the whole matter.


Rather tellingly, as Suarez has since revealed, it was Gerro that talked him into staying, perhaps because he understood how doubt and uncertainty can creep into a player's mind when the carrot that is CL football is dangled in front of them? 

Suarez isn't a blameless figure in this whole scenario, but he's not some dastardly trickster that wants fans on his side so he can turn against them.

However, we were playing South Africa. The game wasn't boring but it was kind of apathetic. It's weird saying that since we scored five goals, but there just really wasn't anything to prove. We scored really early in the game and from then on the players knew they were gonna win so they just relaxed and kept on counter attacking and trying fancy tricks. Still a good boost to morale though!",0,1394067506,null,0,false,0,cfvg5w0,t3_1znecs,t1_cfvg5w0,t3_1znecs,null,1432676316,4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,4
