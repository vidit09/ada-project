We've played two big teams, Pool and City, and had two big thrashings. 


Against Pool we didn't turn up, and were at *least* as bad as any time last year, arguably worse (the way Townsend strolled back after losing the ball on that third goal....).

Against City, we played well in patches for 60 minutes then fell apart like a Chinese motorcycle. Our defence was sickening - we stood off tackles, we didn't press and we didn't seem to have a leader.

For sure if Bob hits that penalty, it's a different game but once he missed we looked a beaten team, even tho it was still only 2-1.

I think, if Poch wants us to press and play high, that's fine but he needs to convince the players they can do it for a whole match. We didn't seem to have a plan against City at times.


tl'dr: it's too early for saying we've turned some kind of corner and are now real competitors against the big teams. We are still a long way off.

Certainly not. 

Subreddit moderators *are*, however, responsible for the groups they actively choose to endorse. That's entirely under their control. 

&gt;Not only that, how can a politics orientated sub, related to a party of a democratic nation, possibly be expected to censor posts on a supposedly free-speech based website? 

Reddit isn't, nor has it ever been, a ""free-speech based website"". It's a common platform for communities to form, under rules imposed by the moderators of those communities. /r/BritishPolitics was established, explicitly, as an environment for discussion about UK politics free from the runaway bigotry and infighting that's turned /r/ukpolitics into a horrible place to spend time over the past year. 

We're not an anti-UKIP subreddit. UKIP posters are absolutely welcome here, as are people from all corners of the political spectrum, so long as they abide by the rules. 

The problem is that /r/ukipparty are linking to a racist subreddit. It doesn't matter a whit if the purported reason for the subreddit's existence is ""free speech"" if it's run by racists, almost entirely populated by racists, and the overwhelming majority of its post are on a sliding scale from slightly racist to Heil Hitler. 

&gt;UKIP's main priority is Europe and a link to one its active subs seems logical.

/r/Europe exists. It's a respectable, significantly more active subreddit, *not* run by white supremacists. 

Linking to /r/European is a *choice* by the /r/ukipparty moderators, to the exclusion of the main European subreddit. ",0,1413674681,moderator,0,false,0,cld9rgb,t3_2jn08m,t1_cld9rgb,t1_cld94p6,null,1426462393,5,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,5

Police camped out in trees and in the gardens to try and find whoever was doing it. They set up surveillance cameras, night vision cameras and motion detectors. They hired ballistics experts to try and figure it out. All came up empty.

Some residents laced thread around their garden to see if it would be broken. The thread was intact the next morning, even though there had been attacks overnight.

Priests and paranormal experts were called in as the police searches came up empty and people began to wonder if the stone thrower was even human.

Between 1801 and 1805 Lord Elgin, the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, of which Athens had been a part for some 350 years, acting with the full knowledge and permission of the Ottoman authorities, removed about half of the remaining sculptures from the fallen ruins and from the building itself. Lord Elgin was passionate about ancient Greek art and transported the sculptures back to Britain.These sculptures were acquired from Lord Elgin by the British Museum in 1816 following a Parliamentary Select Committee enquiry which fully investigated and approved the legality of Lord Elgin’s actions. Since then the sculptures have all been on display to the public in the British Museum, free of entry charge.

Our working class *includes* migrant labourers. They work here, they're taxed here they should have a say, a voice but they don't. They're silenced and ignored - many of them can't even vote (which equates to taxation without representation a liberty that is supposedly basic).

Fundamentally, if you want to claim to represent working class people (the proletariat, *people that have to work*, or whatever we're going to call them) you have to represent all of this group.

Their base is mainly white, middle aged, middle income people from rural areas. This isn't a problem in itself, we live in a democracy, but to define *this one subgroup* as *the working class of Britain* is, at best, a pretty ignorant form of bias.

I have lived in London for 10 years, and I have never heard of anything like this happening, apart from a couple of random phone muggings here and there. Someone I know who has martial arts training got his phone pinched and decked the guy a few months back, but that's about the worst thing I've heard.

Admittedly I'm pretty middle class and most of my friends are too, but I know plenty of people who go clubbing regularly in places like Brixton and Shoreditch which have a bit of a 'rep' (deserved or not, I'm still not sure...).

I know this stuff happens, but I figure the anecdotal experience at least means it can't be very common. Sorry for your experience, I believe some UK cities have a much bigger problem with drunken loutish behaviour than London does.

Controversially, I also liked how the asshole old guy survived. I think it's good to buck convention like that; too many works of fiction have the ""worthy"" surviving and characters like that getting ""karmic deaths"". In reality it doesn't work that way. Averted tropes are great. Subverted tropes are better - not only did the asshole survive, but several totally innocent (for the purposes of the story) died in his place.

I know what this season is, and it should be obvious to anyone by this point. It's about choices. It's about morality. It's a character study on who The Doctor is and why it makes the choices he does. It's a glimpse into how he can affect the lives of those around him and what he does to the people who frequent with him.

this is a triumph.  I'm making a note here: **huge success.**  Its hard to overstate my satisfaction.  

The doctor's TaRDiS; its small and its blue but big inside. For the good of all of us, except the ones who are bad.  

But there's no sense [crying over every mistake](http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/raining_david_tennant.gif).  'Cause at least your [OC] isn't a [fucking cake!](http://www.blastr.com/sites/blastr/files/styles/blog_post_media/public/lazy-tardis-cake.jpg?itok=VbsbK2nn)
And the Science gets don't but he won't use a gun and I think the TaRDiS is Alive!

He's getting quite angry.  And he has got such a mad scowl.  Even though he has two hearts he can be...quite a curmudgeon. And that makes him seem more like the first.  But now he through with turning new, except then Gallifray called.  

No that limit bullshit isn't holding him back, he can go forever, like he was Captain Jack, except his face will turn new, and his clothing will too, but the TaRDis will still be alive. 

Amy had to leave me.  At least Rory's there...right by...her side.  Clara's cool, but Jenny's so much cooler. And Madame Vashta, oh yeah and Strax.  Him Too.  Anyway this picture's great, its got like ev-er-ry-thing.  

Look at me, still typing, cause there's nothing to do, except watch the doctor or maybe a few, he has screwdrivers to use and he knows just what to do, with the TaRDiS who is still Alive.  

PS: And believe me that she is still alive.  

PPS: I think she's Missy, and she's still alive. 

PPPS:This is my wallpaper and she's alive.

Bobby was captain at Valencia, but it wouldn't work for obvious reasons. Fazio might be an alternative in a year if he manages to settle properly, since he was captain at Sevilla. I think that Holtby would have made a great vice-captain, or even captain in a few years, if he could stay composed instead of rushing headlong into tackles and whatnot.

Vertonghen's attitude towards the club hasn't exactly been great, and I would personally expect a lot more from someone who would be captain.

It further recognises that commemorating the victims of genocide, racial hatred and totalitarianism, and promoting public awareness of these crimes against humanity, is essential to sustaining and defending democratic culture and civil society, especially in the face of a resurgence of neo-fascism, racial hatred and neo-Stalinism across Europe.

&gt; The Student Union shall organise commemorative events for students and members of the public on Holocaust Memorial Day (27th of January), on the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism (23rd of August annually), on the Holodomor Genocide Memorial Day Act (4th Saturday in November, Annually) and on Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day (24th April annually).

false,duffelcoatsftw,eng-Oxfordshire,Witney Constituency,"Hi, let me say how glad I am that you're thinking of our nation as a home!

I'm a development manager (business, not gaming), so hopefully I can answer your questions. 

&gt; - Is there any city more oriented towards software development?

Dev is pretty evenly distributed, though like all sectors London will make you the most money (but cost you the most too).

I hate big megacities, but London is a great place, if that suits you. If not, make sure you research the town (on /r/unitedkingdom?) before accepting the job.

&gt; - Is there such a thing as good weather on any part of the UK?

No. We have two weeks of good weather a year. During these two weeks you will not find a more glorious and verdant land to live in. Then autumn happens. To illustrate, I called my dad this week for a chat, and we both agreed that while we were certain we'd seen the sun this week, we wouldn't be able to pick it out of a police line-up.

Seriously though, consider the impact of our climate on your mental health. I have had two Australian ex - pats describe how regular suicidal feelings can happen during winter.

&gt; - If I move to London would I be able to have a car with ease? I quite like driving so having to give that up will devastating.

You can own a car in London, but don't drive it in the centre. The public transport is the best I've ever experienced, and keeping a car in central London is both difficult and expensive. 

- Are some cities more friendly towards foreigners than others?

Everywhere you go you will find friendly people. EU immigration being bad is a hot topic at the moment, but this is focused on unemployed or low - skilled workers. If you arrive already employed and with a technical skill, people will be welcoming.

&gt; - Are there any prejudices towards Portuguese people?

You have not made the effort to bring caldeirada or indeed any of your other dishes to our shores. I'm pretty angry about that. But seriously, no. The more the merrier is an actual English idiom.

- How much is a decent wage? 

You haven't said much about your skill level. Sadly I don't have any openings at the moment, but if you were to send me your CV and covering letter (and preferably an example project) I could give you an estimate of how much I would be willing to pay. I am based I the South East.

The Australian TV coverage had a man on the sidelines, who said two things of interest: firstly, that Poch spent the whole first half giving more tactical instructions than any manager he'd ever seen, and secondly, that as the first half went on, he implored our side to get higher and higher up the pitch.

I think the initial strategy wasn't too play as high as we eventually did... our first goal, and the linkups between Eriksen and Soldado in particular gave Poch some confidence that we may be able to get something out of the game.  So he went for a high risk/high reward strategy... one that would either pay off handsomely, or backfire badly.  Once Soldado missed his pen, the latter happened.

But we were a disaster waiting to happen for most of the match.  The amount of space Navas, Aguero and Silva had to run into was ridiculous, and Rose's positioning was especially suicidal.

Seems it was a good thing I didn't wait until Monday to try again for my GP. Words like ""dead flesh"" and ""sloughing off"" and ""risk of spreading"" were thrown around by the nurse practitioners at the WIC.

I could see my mum's point about the waiting time though.

It just so happens that I currently work on medical disability claims for the US Army, and PTSD is one of the most popular ailments I see. True combat PTSD is rare, and well over 90% of the claims are fakes, exaggerations, or due other mental conditions entirely. 

There just hasn't been any battle like Verdun or Iwo Jima in the current war on terror. There are a few soldiers who saw heavy combat, but they are rare indeed. Most of the claims I see these days are soldiers who claim they were permanently traumatized due to ordinary (for Iraq) things like seeing dead bodies or hearing mortars at night. Not combat. In their case file I often can see they already had behavioral health problems before they joined the military, or their PTSD claims started when they got in trouble for other things at work and they are looking for an easy way out of it.  

Look at this article for example, I don't have Fitzsimons medical case file, but I can see inconsistencies in his case just in the short article. He supposedly has PTSD, yet he volunteers to go back to Iraq as a contractor? Then he shoots his colleagues after heavy drinking, and so with no other defense, blames it on the PTSD. Once again, I don't have his full medical history but this is just what I notice right off the bat. 

This article also claimed: ""*in America, 20% of veterans returning from Afghanistan and Iraq have been diagnosed with PTSD; in 2011, 476,514 veterans were treated for it*."" That's not because combat has been so heavy for arduous.

Moffat stated that after the Flesh episodes that 2 parters were basically done for. He said they saw diminished viewership for the second episode that it wasn't any cheaper to film that second episode(At most you'd save on scouting locations for the second episode and not having to move production, But you'd likely then pump that into the episode to give it more gravitas anyway)

Which is more or less true. You can't really tune into the second half of a story and have it make sense unless you make it 2 stories with a small bridging section. So if the first episode isn't great because it's setting up the second then you might have people not tune in for the great second half. And if they missed the first half they aren't going to know all the ground work laid for the second half.

Though there are rumours that the end of season will be a 2 parter. Which at least might be easier to promote. Since it gets that end of season marketing push. Where it's a lot harder to push for a 2 parter in the middle of the story that doesn't have any huge long term repurcussions(I mean the Flesh 2 parter only really the last 5 minutes and the concept of the flesh was relevant to the rest of the season.)",0,1413689816,null,0,false,0,cldfxty,t3_2jmwj9,t1_cldfxty,t1_cld6vgz,null,1426459499,17,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,17

Then, several people incl. veterans chastised her for referring to PTSD, because in their view PTSD was a phenomenon only caused by combat experiences and that only war veterans should use the term. A further implication was that her acquiring PTSD somehow diminished veterans' experiences. 

On the face of it, continued threats of sexual violence and other harassment may sound ""tame"", but  clinically speaking, it is possible to develop an anxiety disorder from them. Individuals are different, and women are more prone to developing PTSD or PTSD symptoms than men.

At any rate, military veterans do not even have the highest rates of PTSD diagnoses. The highest PTSD rates are among victims of sexual violence. 

In conclusion, her claims:

 1) getting abuse (rape threats etc.) = plausible  
 2) developing PTSD symptoms from them = plausible  
 3) getting diagnosed by a medical professional = plausible

Other Doctors didn't seem to, perhaps it was Matt Smith's. What if it was? How does that cheapen it? It's part of his wardrobe, which *makes it canonical.*

""The price for having him on the show?"" The price is that the Doctor **now wears a ring**. What a monster, that Peter Capaldi. We need crucifixions - I've got some 2x4s, someone get the rope.

What is wrong with you? Let's deconstruct this little play you're having in your head, hm?

&gt; Similarly I wouldn't want costume drama actors playing their parts in whatever cozy outfits they happen to like, instead of their proper intended outfits.

That is his intended outfit. Suit, no tie.

&gt; If you can't not wear your favorite leather jacket, you better damn well stop accepting jobs where characters you play are not wearing leather jackets.

Is he wearing his favorite blazer each week? Where's his nice Hawaiian shirt and flip-flops? He's not doing that.

&gt; There is mythos behind Doctor Who, having this mythos decided by whatever random baggage actors bring to it from their personal life cheapens the show, makes it much less interesting to speculate about(if the answer for anything relating to the Doctor can be ""Well, that's just something Peter Capaldi likes doing/owns"", you might as well stop looking for in-universe explanations), and just generally makes it look unprofessionally produced.

This show's never looked more professional in terms of production, so find another complaint. As for mythos, **you don't know.** You want to know, you think they haven't come up with something, but you, like the rest of us, are in the dark. If they put together a prop to make it more in-line with the production, I'm gonna go ahead and bet there's a canonical explanation.

&gt; All this because the actor playing the main part is refusing to take off his ring? Sorry, I liked his Doctor, but if the price for having him on the show is this high, I'd rather skip to the next one.

All this because the actor playing the Doctor had a stipulation that his ring meant more to him than his craft. What a bastard, that one. And the production was okay with it. The show doesn't have an obligation to you. Peter Capaldi doesn't have an obligation to you.

false,notwherebutwhen,null,null,"Ever the overachiever, I decided to give one from each Doctor (and I will stick to the television series/movie because only a smaller portion of fandom is familiar with the novels/comics/audios).

**First Doctor** (The Edge of Destruction): As we learn about each other, so we learn about ourselves.

* This one is true on so many levels. We may have our own internal dreams, our own internal monologues, our own internal intentions, but we are defined by how we extend ourselves into the universe. What we choose to show from inside, what we pretend to be, how we interact with people can often tell us more about ourselves than what we could determine on our own. And learning about other people's internal worlds can be both a mirror into or own souls and a window to see from another's viewpoint.

**Second Doctor** (The Moonbase): There are some corners of the universe which have bred the most terrible things. Things which act against everything we believe in. They must be fought.

* Although we have yet to really explore the universe there are already terrible things we face here on Earth. These are things that work against the inherent beauty of life, that seek to destroy people who are different, that ruin the experiences of others. Sometimes these are physical things like people or governments, other times they are mental like mental illness or thoughtless hatred. And although they may scare us or threaten us, we have to fight them.

**Third Doctor** (The Time Warrior): A straight line may be the shortest distance between two points, but it is by no means the most interesting.

* Sometimes things need to be short and sweet, things need to be done quickly and efficiently, but there are other times when a straight line needs to be bent and curved and twisted. Sometimes you shouldn't have a plan. Sometimes you should decide to take a different route to work, or ride a different trail, or go to a different restaurant. Time may be linear for us but our lives don't have to be.

**Fourth Doctor** (The Face of Evil): Answers are easy. It's asking the right questions that is hard.

* This actually really resonates with my scientific background. Sometimes all it takes to solve a long term problem is to look at it from a different angle. Sometimes what appears to be a random spike or a mistake can actually become something important. In fact you always find an answer in science; something always happens at the end of an experiment. The real solution to the problem is whether or not your question was answered or another. Maybe your question was wrong or maybe it needs to be amended in some fashion to find the answer you are seeking.

**Fifth Doctor** (The Five Doctors): A man is the sum of his memories.

* All we can do is act in the present, but the choices we make are decided with the knowledge of the past and the projection of the future. In every moment of everyday we are a collection of memories, experiences, and thoughts already past. And so it is in a sense our duty to make those memories count and put them to good use whether they be largely good or bad.

**Sixth Doctor** (Timelash): The waves of time wash us all clean.

* No matter what we do in life, time will eventually erase it. Some things are etched in a little deeper but they too will fade one day. We always have a chance to do better even if our life is filled with nothing but ill will and failures. I find this a more poetical version of time heals all wounds because it takes into account that some wounds don't necessarily heal but can be forgotten or accepted or even erased.
* On a more meta note, this quote proves that there can be gems to be found in every episode of Doctor Who even if it is relatively panned.

**Seventh Doctor** (Ghost Light): We all have a universe of our own terrors to face.

* I personally do not subscribe to the suffering Olympics. One of the worse things someone can say to a person suffering from depression is how can they feel so bad or empty when their lives are going so well and there are people who have it much worse off than them. We all have our own personal lives and our own personal demons and yes while certain things can be considered objectively worse than others that doesn't take away from how bad other things are. And everyone handles things differently. Some people can handle physical pain better than emotional pain and vice versa.

**Eight Doctor** (TV Movie): You want dominion over the living, yet all you do is kill.

* This one may seem a bit of an odd choice, but hopefully I can make some sense of it for you (and just for some background the Doctor says this to the Master soon after his grand plan has failed). I actually extend this quote to man's (and alien's) occasional self-defeating nature. So many times when people want something bad they can actually do everything to prevent themselves from doing so.

**War Doctor** (The Day of the Doctor): How many worlds has his regret saved, do you think?

* I love the great men forged in fire line but I think that this line despite its brevity resonates a bit more. Out of the lessons of what he saw as his failures, the Doctor was able to do so much good. He was able to save many lives and help others to see the errors of their ways out of the regret that he felt for what he did in the Time War. As Five said, we are a sum of our memories and even the bad memories can be used for good. Even our darkest of days can lead to our greatest hours.

**Ninth Doctor** (The End of the World): You spend all your time thinking about dying, like you're gonna get killed by eggs, or beef, or global warming or asteroids. But you never take time to imagine the impossible - like maybe you survive.

* Sometimes all we can imagine is what bad things can or will come. I will fail that test, I will not get that job, that girl/boy will say no. And yes we shouldn't live in our own fantasy world where we think only good things can happen, but it seems more often than not we are willing to lose ourselves in nightmares when our dreams are actually right around the corner. So many things out there can ""kill"" you but you also have a good chance of surviving those things.

**Tenth Doctor** (Tooth and Claw): You want weapons? We’re in a library! Books! The best weapons in the world!

* I thought about choosing a few others for this one and partially chose this particular quote anticipating what others may choose, but I still resonate strongly with this one. Learning and gathering knowledge is what has allowed us as humans to constantly transcend out limits and expand out minds and putting this knowledge down on paper (or in electronics as we do now) has allowed us to increase the rate this knowledge is gathered and the speed in which people learn it. Books are our ultimate weapon against ignorance and to discover the unknown.
* Unfortunately though these weapons are not always positive ones. For years people have warred and fought over religious texts and political documents. As much as books have the power to create they have the power to destroy.

**Eleventh Doctor** (The Power of Three): But this is one corner of one country, in one continent, on one planet that’s a corner of a galaxy that’s a corner of a universe that is forever growing and shrinking and creating and destroying, and never remaining the same for a single millisecond. And there is so much, so much to see. 

* No matter what happens in my life or anyone's life, we are only on one corner of a planet, in one corner of a solar system, in one corner of a galaxy, in one corner of the universe. This prospect is tantalizing, beautiful, and terrifying in equal measure. It seems everything both insignificant and incredibly important. We are the universe experiencing itself and there is nearly no end to what we can learn and explore. The Doctor captures all this majesty in a pretty stellar quote.

**Twelfth Doctor** (Mummy on the Orient Express): Sometimes all you have are bad choices, but you still have to chose

* At some point in everyone's life they have to make the hard choices. We don't always get to decide between a sucker and a lollipop. And making no choice at all often only serves to make the choices left even worse. It is true that some choices may still be objectively worse, but it is not always easy to determine especially during the decision process. It can be easy to demonize people for the choices they have made, but we aren't always given or can see better choices.",0,1413694007,null,0,1413732986,0,cldhgxs,t3_2jn23v,t1_cldhgxs,t3_2jn23v,null,1426458785,17,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,17

If there was an active effort to discredit a movement it'd be the way to go.  However, in most cases it's almost certainly not necessary.  At least where a movement falls significantly short of near total public approval.

There is never a shortage of people who just want a fight, or who want to break something from the anonymity of a crowd, or who are looking for a chance for opportunistic looting.  In short: Some people are just dickheads.

I've seen it both in videos of the Greek riots a few years ago and on one occasion before my own eyes.  In both cases trouble starts with a few people.  It's hard to explain precisely *how* but you can spot them before the event - They behave *differently*.

Also, I have an [electric mattress cover](http://www.amazon.ca/Sunbeam-Heated-Mattress-100-Percent-Polyester/dp/B00AQ06KVW/ref=sr_1_1?s=kitchen&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1413699450&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=heated+mattress+pad) (not that one - I bought mine locally, can't find it online) that I would defend with my life. Basically it's like a fitted sheet over my mattress, and you can turn it on before you get in bed and then when you get in it's super warm and cozy like your bed feels after you've been in it for hours. It has a mode where it only heats up under where your body is (not super smart, I mean like if you're sitting up it only heats the top half, there are like 4 'zones' - you can probably buy fancier ones). It gets much colder here than it does in the UK (depending - I'm on the east coast so average winter temps are ~5C) so the mattress thing might be hard to find, but I would recommend it to anyone who wants to save on heating costs while staying cozy in bed.",0,1413698752,null,0,1413699645,0,cldivis,t3_2jmqd6,t1_cldivis,t3_2jmqd6,null,1426458129,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

But if you look at the number of passes he had, it was only 21. Usually he has more passes than anyone on our team by quite a bit simply because he controls possession. 

Today was not the case because we were attempting to play way too quickly and completely bypassing midfield in an attempt to counter-attack as fast as possible. Now obviously, counter-attacking can be extremely effective when used correctly and our best chances came from winning the ball in midfield and getting it up top quickly. Despite this however, we squandered possession far too many times which meant Capoue wasn't ever able to establish good positioning to stop the City attacking. 

We're used to seeing ourselves dominate possession and having Etienne stop the other team attacking before their move begins. That didn't happen yesterday because the game was bypassing him offensively and defensively. Maybe that is a fault in his game, but if we had prioritized possessing the ball just slightly more instead of playing passes that had zero chance of being completed, we would have seen better results.

If you have correspondence or evidence that other people were paid more once they earned an NVQ that would be useful evidence.

You can take them to the Employment Tribunal for unpaid wages.  However you'd have to pay £160 for the initial application and potentially another £230 for a hearing.  The problem here is that not only is that an upfront expense for you, but going back to the first point if you can't prove the money was owed it won't get you anywhere.

The other thing to bear in mind is that your employer might respond badly if you push them.  That's not that they're right to, just that they may decide to punish you for it.  Only you'd be in a position to make a judgement on that.

I'd be inclined to suggest you check in with the Citizens' Advice Bureau.  Chances are they have someone with experience of this sort of thing.

- Witnessed my mum and her friend get mugged (guess where folks!) in broad daylight; her friend shouted 'that bastard's stolen my necklace!' - he walked back, fingered her broken necklace which was hanging off her neck, said 'no I haven't' and proceeded to beat the living shit out of her in front of me (aged 8), my sister (aged 12) and my mum.

We first see Clara as Dalek Oswin Oswald. 

Then we see her involved with the Victorian-era Great Intelligence, which kills her. We first learn, along with Doctor, that she's ""The Impossible Girl"" - ""The Snowmen""

Then we see her - in the first episode of season 7 - sucked into the Wi-Fi of the Great Intelligence in the same episode as ""The Girl in The Shop"" (River? Missy?), the episode basically titled The TARDIS Phone - ""The Bells of St. John""

How do we end Season 7? Again, with Clara and the Great Intelligence! Clara enters the Doctor's time-stream and saves him (she was ""the girl born to save the Doctor"", after all). The Doctor wonders to River, why didn't Clara die? River replies, Spoilers. - ""The Name of The Doctor""

What does all of this have in common (skip Oswin)? The Great Intelligence. (No, there's no reason to believe it disappeared with Dr. Simeon.)

Lastly...

* Has the Great Intelligence ever been involved with the Cybermen? 
* Couldn't Missy be involved with the GI?
* Whoever was in charge of the Orient Express had the TARDIS phone number. (See ""Big Bang"", Season 5)
* Remember the mysterious ""The Impossible Girl"" ad in the newspaper in ""Deep Breath""?

I liked Mummy episode better. This one didn't really nail any of the aspects it was going for.

Bad guys didn't really have motives, they weren't really following any particular rules, and I really couldn't get that ""alien intelligence I can't fathom"" fibe from them either. It was CGI snakes running around the walls. But Clara was fun to follow as the Doctor, and that Rigsy character was really fun tag-along. I would've hoped more Doctor-cliches explored or parodied by Clara, now it was left quite shallow.

This seasons story arc didn't really go anywhere here, just some rather heavy-handed moments towards the end of the episode.

All that being said, I liked the episode. I was just a bit disappointed since this premise has now been visited and is unlikely to be done again anytime soon, and I really think there was more potential there to be used. Dimensions shifting, Tardis getting smaller, those are really intriguing ideas.

Whilst I agree that getting 'on the ladder' is very difficult, it is doable - like anything it requires sacrifice.

My partner and myself live in a touring caravan on campsites whilst we save up for a house deposit.
For over a year now, we have sacrificed having space, mains water, sewage etc...
Other than going to work, we rarely take part in any leisure activities which cost any money.

The result is, that we now have our 10% deposit together.
No, it is not easy. Yes we have sacrificed a lot, and even lost some good friends along the way. But, it is perfectly doable.

That being said, we have only just managed it - I used to think a teacher was a well paid job - it really isn't.

For comparison, I've spoken to parents, grandparents, my partners parents about what it was like getting their first house - their first houses were 2/3 bed semi / fully detached, with comparatively lower wages - not to mention the 100%+ mortgages that were available. Although at one point there was a horrific interest rate (15%+ I believe, I wasn't alive yet).

So, yes, it is difficult. But it can be done. I think it used to be easier than it is now, but that is irrelevant really.

Did people buy houses relatively young? Yes.

Was it all daisies and unicorn farts? Well.... No. Back then, the chancellor of the exchequer controlled interest rates and could manipulate them for political (rather than economic) reasons. Interest rates shot up to 15% almost overnight.

Fixed rate mortgages were much less common than they are today. So lots of people found their mortgage payments doubling over the course of a few months. No problem, move downmarket slightly and reduce the mortgage, yes?

Not really. Everyone had the same idea simultaneously, causing property prices to plummet. Suddenly many young people in their first home were in negative equity - they had a mortgage they couldn't afford and they couldn't sell up to clear the mortgage because the mortgage was now for rather more than the house was worth.

[Improper use of public electronic communications network - Communications Act 2003, section 127](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/communications_offences/#an11)

&gt;Section 127(1)(a) relates to a message etc that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character and should be used for indecent phone calls and emails

&gt;Section 127(2) targets false messages and persistent misuse intended to cause annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety; it includes somebody who persistently makes silent phone calls (usually covered with only one information because the gravamen is one of persistently telephoning rendering separate charges for each call unnecessary). 

&gt;If a message sent is grossly offensive, indecent, obscene, menacing or false it is irrelevant whether it was received. The offence is one of sending, so it is committed when the sending takes place. The test for ""grossly offensive"" was stated by the House of Lords in DPP v Collins [2006] 1 WLR 2223 to be whether the message would cause gross offence to those to whom it relates (in that case ethnic minorities), who need not be the recipients. The case also said that it is justifiable under ECHR Art 10(2) to prosecute somebody who has used the public telecommunications system to leave racist messages. 

&gt;A person guilty of an offence under section 127 CA 2003 shall be liable, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine or to both. This offence is part of the fixed penalty scheme

Here is the important bit

&gt;Section 127 can be used as an alternative offence to such crimes for example as hate crime (including race, religion, disability, homophobic, sexual orientation, and transphobic crime), hacking offences, cyber bullying, cyber stalking, amongst others. 

All they are doing is increasing the Tariff for the punishment of this offence, nothing new is changing, and it certainly is NOT Trolling

&gt;The __Danelaw__, as recorded in the *[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle)* (also known as the __Danelagh__; [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English): *Dena lagu*; [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_language): *Danelagen*), is a historical name given to the part of [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) in which the laws of the [Danes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danes_(Germanic_tribe\)) held sway  and dominated those of the [Anglo-Saxons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxons). It is contrasted with [West Saxon law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_law) and [Mercian law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadripartitus). The term has been extended by modern historians to be geographical. The areas that constituted the Danelaw are in northern and eastern England. The origins of the Danelaw arose from the [Viking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking) expansion of the 9th century, although the term was not used to describe a geographic area until the 11th century. With the increase in population and productivity in [Scandinavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia), Viking warriors, having sought treasure and glory in the nearby [British Isles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles), ""proceeded to plough and support themselves"", in the words of the *Anglo-Saxon Chronicle*, for the year 876.

false,the_thinker,null,null,"Sorry had slept off...and this is entirely too serious or delicate to reply while being half-asleep anyway!

Keep in mind while reading this...that I am actually Indian and only moved to the Middle East for a job and lived there for 7+ years...also I am most definitely not racist...in case it seems like that from my reply...but some stereotypes are most definitely true

I meant its funny that most people (certainly me) can have a much better lifestyle in a developing country in the Middle East than they can have in a developed country such as the UK...primarily because everything is so expensive here and life in the Middle East is in the ""easy"" mode...especially if you are a Westerner.

So I was not sure about the Mongol invasion of the Middle East and I quickly googled it just now...and it seems that they actually did not reach the Arab regions...but only reached the norther parts (what is modern day Turkey). The Arabs states (now Saudi Arabia , UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain) or most of them at any rate were ruled by the British at some point too....but by then they were not very rich anyway so the British probably did not manage to plunder too much wealth from this area. The oil here was discovered more or less after the British left and has been kind of a blessing to them since then in terms of the money it brings and the potential it is. However there is a common saying in the Middle East that locals were riding camels 2 generations back and while the current and the next generation will ride in Rolls Royces, the generations after that will be back to camels. It is unfortunate how true this is because they are quickly squandering all their oil wealth rather than using it to build a sustainable future (unlike Norway, which is actually using the Oil Fund to build its economy and its future). However, this current squandering of wealth is what makes it lucrative for people to work in the Middle East (note: there are no income taxes in the Middle East since the Government uses oil revenue for all its purposes).

The locals in the Middle East have seen far too much wealth far too quickly (although there are vast income disparities of course) and they obviously act like any ""new money"" person...they flaunt their wealth and the power it brings but are inherently lazy and stupid people (in general). Even the poorest of the locals will not do a menial job, but will expect to be paid good money by the Government simply for existing. The locals who are somewhat educated all want to be ""managers"" in a bank etc. though they do not have the skills for it and do not want to work at all. This creates opportunities for people from outside to come and do all the work and be paid for it. 

Again the locals are highly racist and to them being an Arab is a statement of pride and means being better than anyone else...They maltreat the people who they think are the lowest in the pecking order (people from Philippines, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka) since these are the people who do all the menial jobs, such as the maids, the cooks, the cleaners etc. (jobs which even the poorest locals will not deign to touch). The locals are still a little in awe of the  Westerners (White westerners) and that is why even an incompetent white person can get a highly paid job there and royally screw up things without having to face the consequences. This is ""easy money"" for all sorts of people from Europe, many of whom begin to think that they actually deserve this money because they are that good at what they do (most of them aren't good at all...but are milking the system). They have privileged lifestyles there with maids, cooks, drivers, huge salaries, huge bonuses and huge mansions which they could never dream of having here...and this is what brings out the ""true wankerish colours"" as you put it.",0,1413709437,null,0,false,0,cldl4ok,t3_2jmsie,t1_cldl4ok,t1_cldasuo,null,1426457020,1,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,1

Just pick a stream/ live TV if that is an option for you (maybe only do it for the ones you are able to do via live-feed?),that works for you and commentate to that stream. and tell people which/what you will do doing.

That way if people want to listen to your commentary (I'd probably give it a try), they can turn on their TV/Stream that you have suggested, and then mute it and play your streaming audio like a radio channel.

It also gives people a chance to just listen - I often just want to listen to a game cause I can do so while doing other things.

This is a classic trick from australia, where the channel 9 commentators were a little boring, so people used to mute the TV and turn on the radio in the same room for the radio guy (name/channel I can't remember).

I get it, they did well for the start of the game and somehow ended up 2 - 0 down, then a decision goes against them and they just stop trying.  

Phil Thompson's sky sports match round up summarizes it perfectly for me, a team just giving up, just playing at their absolute worst, vs a team that was hungry, playing at their best.

In most cases Doctor Who rarely ever features a unique baddie any way, what Doctor Who does best is to explore the rather old and almost expired baddie in a unique way. In Orient Express that was exactly the case.

But what got stuck with me most from that episode in general is the line Clara utters in the train's cargo hold,
""We’re stuck in this carriage all night and all we can talk about is some man.""

It just feels like a silly work around just to pass some Bechdel test.

In Flatline this happens beat by beat.

As for professions requiring masters degrees, your going to have to go into a lot more detail than that. Because it'll be rare for a career to require you to complete a B.Sc then a M.Sc for example and the path will normally be set out to move directly from one to the other without seperatation.

The problem: the average house price was £250,000. Even the cheapest property on the market was £90,000 - and that was a one bedroom retirement flat.

At the current rate of building, the Housing Needs Survey estimated it would take about 23 years to get everyone off the waiting list for affordable social rental properties - and this is assuming no-one new joined. The problems (besides the fact the council seemingly couldn't give a shit) are a chronic lack of non-protected land and the Lake District National Park Authority, the 'Friends of the Lake District' (they can fuck right off) and other assorted NIMBYs somehow finding a way to get every development proposal turned down by the planning committee.

I figure this is because it is much more fun to see yourself as a valiant underdog fighting to expose the truth than to see yourself as an unpaid employee of Rupert Murdoch and his sprawling news empire.

This is a more specific example, where they claim discussion is banned *on reddit*. This is charmingly idiotic because anyone can use reddit's search function to prove that they have no idea what they're talking about - this *very thread* is an example of a discussion of Rotherham - but they persist in spreading the falsehood; if they are the Brave Underdogs fighting the Entrenched Establishment they don't have to face up the the fact that what they're essentially doing is using the suffering of children as an obfuscating cloak to get across an anti-immigration message. Bravery debates generally are pretty toxic, but I dislike this one the most - everybody gets so caught up in trying to blame Pakistani men / defend them from unfair accusations of racism that nobody talks seriously about how to protect children and women from this sort of thing in the future - I've never ever seen anyone (left or right) in these threads say, 'There were major failings in the PC left in the police force and this needs to change, but we on the right made a horrible mistake with how we viewed social services and the police response to rape victims and we should own up to that'

Some background: Six months ago I started to suffer from panic attacks. You know that terrifying sensation of dread when you wake up from an awful dream? That's what a panic attack is like. But unlike a dream, the terror doesn't pass when you open your eyes. You're awake, you know everything is fine, yet you can't shake that horrible fear that something is terribly wrong. The first time people have panic attacks they often think they're having a heart attack and rush to the hospital. Panic attacks are a particularly cruel mental disorder because the more you experience them the more you fear them the more you experience them. But the trick to defeating them is accepting them. You experience the fear, you aknowledge your beating heart and your terrified state of mind... But you don't let it control you. You just wait for it to pass and do something else in the meantime.

So many people have so much goodwill invested in Soldado that they see things that aren't there. In one and a quarter seasons at Spurs he has scored two Premier League goals from open play. These would be disastrous stats if he were an unknown striker from the Dutch league who had been bought for £4m. But he was a club record signing who cost £26m. He was signed to score shedloads of goals. It's lovely that he has some neat touches. It's nice that he has ""plenty of energy"" but ultimately that doesn't really count for very much. He doesn't score goals for Spurs. 

Stop looking at him as loyal Spurs fans and start looking at him objectively as football fans. Let's compare him to a player who was regarded as a terrible flop: Afonso Alves was signed by Middlesbrough from Heerenven in 2008 for close to 20m Euros. Like Soldado, he was purchased as a ""proven, guaranteed"" goalscorer. A finisher. He is regarded as a complete flop in the Premier League, one of the worst buys ever. And yet he scored four goals from open play in his first season in the league, which is twice what Soldado has managed. If we look at Soldado objectively and stop making excuses for him, we see that however well he might have played in Spain, he's been absolutely terrible for us. Woeful.

For all Ade's sins (and there are a few), he has a proven track record as a Premier League goalscorer and has scored loads of goals for Spurs. Personally, I think we need someone more consistent than Ade to lead the line, but for now I'd always prefer him to Soldado.

So he puts it on and goes to the Halloween party but when he tries to take it off afterward underneath is no longer his own face but the face of the mask.

We all adopt roles to an extent, I've seen salesmen lose their own personality under the bluster of confidence they have to exude for their job and of course performers are always playing something else so its possible to lose track of who you are or were under all of that.

The other sad aspect of depression and suicide is those that hit a bump in the road. I remember going to see my friend's estranged dad (process of divorce). This was a guy that had a reasonably good career, a fucking lush house, a wife and of course a kid. But there we were in some pokey bedsit in a house share with some middle aged balding man sitting humbly on the edge of a bed in a room without any chairs. When you hit that kind of point I can appreciate the appeal of packing it in. Obviously its nice when they don't but I feel like that whole ""you still have everything to live for"" gets a touch disingenuous a times. Life sometimes sucks and one struggles through it not only ""because it gets better"" but sometimes just for the sake of others around you (in this case I imagine my friend). 
 
A friend of mine was less lucky in his state of mind and cashed in his chips. He had a family and three kids.... his wife became a heavy drug user and became completely impossible to deal with: constant lying, always painting herself as the victim, spending his money as soon as he got it and then running out of fuel half-way down the motorway multiple times, using the kids as collateral. He'd moved out and was living with his mum, he got laid off, his kids were somewhat off the rails and often skipped school (mum never gave a shit and often allowed it to gain brownie points with the kids) and the kids started to skip visits to him.... first a bit, then almost always. That obviously got to him.  
Of course we all now talk about how it was selfish of him to jump off that bridge and how it obviously would effect his kids.... his kids wrote on his facebook wall all the time... I was still friended to him so I saw all that shit.... stuck watching the macabre scenes of a bunch of kids struggling to cope with their dad's suicide. Fucked up but morbidly compelling.  

I dunno.... I think the way society just blithely paints suicide as bad and selfish and anyone who ponders it as ""needing help"" is just as selfish in a way. Perhaps in a kind of: ""thou must continue to live so I and others can keep experiencing you"". I think this simplistic notion fails to truly capture the struggle of man and mortality.... which is possibly why we still struggle with it so much. I mean death is the contract we're born into, its the trade-off of life... so why is it such taboo and such a difficult topic within our society?",0,1413714994,null,0,1413722574,0,cldm1f1,t3_2jnxgs,t1_cldm1f1,t3_2jnxgs,null,1426456595,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Well you're literally going about it in the hardest possible manner.. No one passes their driving test and gets a BMW. Baby steps. You buy a banger first, then you upgrade when you're more experienced. 

Same goes for property. 

Right now you're renting and throwing away money. 

If you're earning, say, £30K a year and you have a £25K deposit then you could buy a place for ~£160K. 

The mortgage repayments on a £135K mortgage are ~£670.38 per month, on a 5 year fixed FTB mortgage at 4.59% with 85% LTV.  This was literally no shopping around. Longest fixed mortgage on the natwest site..

Anyway, of that £670.38 mortgage repayment £154 will be going into paying off the debt. 

So if your current rent is more than £516, and you believe property prices will at least remain stagnant then you're better off buying somewhere. You will be able to save more money for the deposit on your next house and get that LTV down as much as possible. 

Assuming you had been saving £694.44 each month for the past 3 years to make that £25K deposit, if you keep up with that level of saving by the end of the 5 year fixed rate you will have saved an additional £41,666. Add onto that the £9,240 of paying down your mortgage you'd have paid off £50,906 of your mortgage and you'll now have £75,906 of equity in your flat. 

If its price remained stagnant, in 5 years you'll have a LTV of ~50%. 

Not taking into account the savings you'll make from paying £694.44 instead of whatever your rent is.. Usually rent is higher than a mortgage.

false,le-redditor,null,null,"I started watching a bit of Who again after a long hiatus since I am a fan of Capaldi. Things I thought the writer of the last two episodes nailed:

- Lots of civilians. The episode wasn't just about the Doctor and his weird companions. It featured a plethora of side characters thrown into absurd situation keep a stiff upper lip. Everyday people, honest wombles, the quiet batpeople.

- Morality. The Doctor basically admits to Clara in the previous episode, The Mummy, to being a utilitarian. He remarks that he would simply move onto the next person and the next person on the train to minimize the total number of deaths until he had failed to save any. It took Clara to get him motivated to try harder to save the individual who suffered a loss in the opening scene to solve the case quicker, which lead to him saving more people in the end. This directly sets up the Doctor and Clara's conversation in this episode. Clara is the one who begins to use utilitarian language, with her comments that although people died, because the Earth was not destroyed more lives saved ""on balance"". He warns her that while taking on leadership to prevent greater death is the role of doctor, it is not sufficient to make one's actions ""good"", hence ""good has nothing to do with it"".

- Clear Doctor-Companion dynamic. While the moral conversations in the past two episodes are not necessarily profound outside of television, what they did accomplish was to establish a much clearer dynamic between the Doctor and Clara. It reminds us of why the Doctor travels with companions. He recognizes that his leadership and judgement is fallible and needs a constant reminder to always try harder to save each individual in order to stay motivated to save the whole. It rests on the assumption that the values of the Doctor and the values of the companion are perpetually at odds. if Clara becomes more utilitarian like him, he may loose the check-and-balance he has imposed on his judgement.

I had a 650 Bros and it wasn't great on motorways so I bought a zx6r, looking back I probably did that a bit early, that little Bros was a great bike. 

I ended up meeting a guy at work who rode as well, we did a bunch of rides out to places like Aberystwyth (tiring there and back in one day!) and Banbury, there's a great road near Banbury with a good mix of fast and slow corners. Watch for tractors.. 

London isn't great for just pootling around, I commute on the A406 and it's either boring or terrifying depending on my rate of progress. Car drivers are very courteous though, as long as they know you're there. 

So either bite the bullet and attack something a bit boring like the north circular (call by the Ace and have a cup of tea) or set yourself some distant place to ride to and take a few days getting there.

He is one of our greatest comics, and for a man of his intellect, genius and importance to British culture, it is a terrible shame he seems to have such feelings of worthlessness.

However, it's worth remembering that he at least has a mouthpiece to express his views and feelings, whether that is by twitter or through media interviews, and an audience of millions of fans who are ready to listen to him, and if needed I'm sure many of them would offer to help him in anyway possible.

Unfortunately there are hundreds of thousands of people in the UK, and hundreds of millions globally, who suffer from similar mental health problems and feelings of despair and worthlessness in much the same way as Stephen Fry. However, many of them have none of the potential lifelines that he could (and possible does) use; they may be suffering from poverty, unemployment, social exclusion, a lack of any family or friends, no responsibilities to motivate them to live their life, no dates in their diary this week for them to get out of the house for. These people don't even have detestable parties to attend to or detestable white powder to put up their noses. They have nothing.

I know it's awful to compare the two situations - both are extremely bad places to be - however I feel that the anonymous millions are at far greater risk of being totally detached from society than Stephen Fry is. I would hope that by coming out in the press and talking about his experiences with depression he sheds more light on these anonymous sufferers, and offers them some sort of solace in that no matter how famous, rich or successful you are, you can still be totally broken down by emotional problems. However, I fear that this is not the case, and if anything these anonymous sufferers would feel more isolated by reading Stephen Fry's thoughts, as many of them will take the mindset that ""if he can't be helped, then what hope do I have?"".

I'm fairly certain I have never experienced such emotional depths that Stephen Fry appears to regularly, and I honestly feel sympathy for him and hope he can come through his battles, eventually finding a reinvigorated sense of purpose in life. I think my overall message to people is that while offering him sympathy in public forums is great, offering real help to an ""invisible sufferer"" would really be something special.

The thing about Islam is that it really isn't too different to Christianity in that there's so many different sects of people that believe different Parts for different reasons. Now in answer to your question earlier there's the part in the Koran about the prophet Mohammed marrying his wife when she was like 8 and he was about 60 (this was actually played on in that shit stirring movie your guys released called innocence of Muslims) this combined with the belief that men have and always will be above women and not to mention the belief that if your not Muslim you are kafir and or worthless could be a reason it is so widespread. Again I have to point out that this isn't the belief of all Muslims just as it's not only Muslims that are capable of paedophilia (the Catholic Church anyone) but with so many allegations coming out of so many different cities it's really hard to claim there's no smoke without fire.

So I went to my doctors. The first female doctor completely fobbed me off like I was making it up so I got a second opinion. 

The second doctor knew what he was talking about, gave me a course of Propranolol ( which really helps )  and immediately referred me to Psychology Services who then did an assessment and put me on their list. 

 I have my first session next Wednesday, well over a year later. I only get six sessions too. So basically I have six half hour session to get myself off Proprnanol ( which has its fair share of side effects ) and get a handle on the anxiety without it which is essentially my long term aim. 

It'll take two of those sessions to explain my damn problem. 

I will admit though that before I started having the anxiety attacks I didn't view it as a real issue either; as the majority of people who've never had them don't. And that's half the issue, people can't/don't/won't acknowledge what they truly don't understand.

Stand up straight, wash that grease out of your hair (and get a haircut while you're at it), shave, lose some weight, work on your skills and improve your CV and suit up. I can't be the only one who's noticed how unattractive and slovenly these protesters look? Then, ask for a pay-rise, if your employer says no, go and find another job where your talents are more valued. 

If you don't have the skills to find another job, either question what you're doing marching on a Saturday when you could be learning and developing, or accept that even on minimum wage, you're in the top 7.5% of the population and think yourself lucky to have the things you have:

Unless you are homeless, you are far wealthier than the average person, and you live in the richest time period in history. If you go back even 100 years, 0% of the world had a TV, 0% of the world took commercial flights, and a tiny percentage of the world had a car or a radio. Only 10% of the U.S. had a phone, and most phones only connected to a small network of phones, not the whole system.

If you go back even 25 years ago, 0% had cell phones, Internet access , blue tooth or ipods, and only 1.8% of the world had a computer. People paid $2,000 for a computer that was worse than a $50 used computer is today, and there were almost no apps. About 25% of Americans had cable TV with a maximum of 79 channels. Nobody had flat screen TVs or hi-def TVs and almost nobody had big screen TVs. People paid a few hundred dollars for a TV that you can buy used today for $30. Today, most of us have all of the above, yet have been persuaded that we still don’t have enough.

The person at the exact middle level in the world lives on $1,700 a year when adjusted for differences in costs of living, aka purchasing power parity, meaning it’s $1,700 US dollars that can buy the same amount we can with $1,700. The U.S. median is $28,567 or about 12 times more. It's actually quite a lot more because the $1,700 figure includes all consumption, while the American figure does not include things like free public schools, unreported income, and existing assets such as bank accounts, investments and real estate. People trying to live on less than $1,7000 a year typically don't have bank accounts or any assets.

Then I found [this](http://blog.abundancegeneration.com/2013/08/how-much-carbon-dioxide-do-solar-panels-save/) article that looks at how much CO2 solar panels save, and it says that it's a pretty complicated problem, of course. But one figure stands out for me - the saving of a household PV installation. Which is 0.9 tonnes of CO2 per year.

So, by my calculation, a household would need to eat 60,000 imported apples (by sea) to offset the CO2 saved by their PV installation, or 2142 by air.

Compare that to the triangle of streets outside Newcastle central station (and including anything inside the station) in the same month.

Number 25 on Hannover should have been this player, but that would have left a 2v1 with no keeper, which brings me to my next point: you can see the midfielders lazily jogging back as the ball goes into the net, a full 7 seconds after the ball was stolen.  If I were the keeper in this situation, I would be going all Tim Howard on the back 4 and the midfielders because they just made me look like an asshat.

If this were Chelsea, Terry would have picked up Thorgan's run in the unlikely event that Oscar or Matic decided to not track said run, allowing Courtois to stay in goal the whole time.  This is why Mourinho doesn't want lazy midfielders and it's also why Chelsea's GD is +15 and this club's is -6.

false,circuitology,eng-kent,Kent,"&gt;It's because the young don't vote in anything like the number the old do

Ive been thinking more about this recently, and come to the conclusion that it just doesn't matter how many young people vote, even if they had 100% turnout.

There's a range of 6 years between 18-25, which is start of voting age to the end of being a ""young person"". 

Given the age of the population is pretty evenly distributed up to the age of around 65, what we will always have is a scenario where the voice of those in the range covering 41 years will be competing with the voice of those in just a 6 year range.

So you essentially have one voice vs. seven. Or just over 14%.

Why would any politician care about 14% of the electorate, when they can care about 86% instead? And that's not even counting those over 65, of which there are many.

We will have to wait until we are older and still have virtually nothing despite working hard on the premise that things will improve, then we might be able to change things for future young people. 

Of course when that time comes it will be framed as a choice of whether to take from ourselves and give to the young, or vice versa. Will be interesting to see what we decide.

Furthermore, one average person does not buy one average house. Usually it's 2 people who buy together. In which case saving a deposit is far easier. 

It's really not that bad. Usually people just don't really prioritise saving and prefer to spend more of their salary than they should.

Divide and conquer strategies have been common in political contexts regarding labour for years. The *only time* labour rights have ever been improved is when there has been a significant majority of the workforce challenging the owners of production.

In the past you could have said this was race less and mainly rural, but this isn't the case today.

Like it or not immigrants are working people - and often the poorest most under represented group of working people. You cannot, simultaneously, proclaim to support the interests of the working class of Britain and exclude this group. It is a complete non-sense.

I agree with you that a lot of support workers in health care aren't particularly skilled and are easily replaceable but you obviously aren't aware that our country is currently facing a shortage or trained Nurses. 

I happen to work in theatres in the private sector (not in a nursing role) and you might be suprised to learn that majority of the jobs here, nursing or otherwise, are paid in line with NHS Agenda for Change. Having previously worked in the NHS I know I'm not really any financially better off here. And personally I'd rather myself or my family were cared for by someone who had years experience than by staff with little to no experience who know they are getting replaced within a year anyway. And if you honestly think supply and demand dictates that the NHS would increase wages if ""a few"" people were to leave you clearly have absolutely no idea how the NHS or the public sector in general works and should perhaps refrain from commenting on something you don't understand.

And as for ""they're paid what they're paid because they have no other skills"" so a nurse, whilst studying her nursing degree, should also study what? Quantum Mechanics? Why should someone who has spent their entire life thus far in education for a specific role, be penalised for that? Should we cut Doctors pay as they have after all only trained to be a doctor and not a tree surgeon as well? And of course they don't have a degree in Renaissance Art, better dock their pay for that.

""Even on minimum wage, they're in the top 7.5% of the world population"" that may be so, you haven't provided a source for that so I guess I'll just have to trust you (and you seem so well informed on this why wouldn't I!). As nearly half the worlds population is actually living in Poverty or Extreme Poverty, this seems a little less impressive. And at the end of the day, just because something performs better than another thing, doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement. 

Minimum Wage in the UK is currently set at £6.50. If you work an average working week of 37.5 hours then your yearly income after tax would be £11,574. Doesn't seem that bad does it? Thats rougly £964 a month. Now considering the average UK rental cost is now £768 (http://www.propertywire.com/news/europe/england-wales-rental-values-201410179717.html) that leaves around £196 to pay bills (council tax, energy, water, phone and internet etc) and also feed your family for the month.

Hijacking a thread about dogs by posting cat photos is trolling. Bloody annoying but at the end of the day it hurts no one.

Telling someone repeatedly you're going to rape them isn't harmless, the media have hijacked the term troll when what they essentially mean is ""bit of a cunt"".

Having said that I find the idea of locking someone up for saying nasty things crazy. Repeatedly targeting the same person perhaps, but I'd go down the harassment route.

But if someone got into legal trouble for telling someone on Twitter that they're a nonce and they're going to bomb their house then I'd be completely against it.

In the last ~5 years though with the huge influx of students from all parts of China standards have improved if you know where to look. You cant really say 'what's rare' because China is HUGE and has lots of different styles of cooking. Lots of natives from other areas have also opened restaurants and are making amazing food, although clientèle is mostly Chinese.

I have a choice of 3 real Cantonese restaurants/takeaways and a Szechuan takeaway, as well as about 30 of the aforementioned rubbish ones, in a mediumish University City. Search harder (and look where the Chinese people are going) and you will find much better food.

From the Cantonese places I'd go for a pork and aubergine dish, or maybe Pork belly or Beef with fresh veg.

From a Szechuan place, I'd go for cumin lamb, spicy aubergine and a big bowl of spicy chilli soup (I forget the name) with some fish or pork.

**Price of product:** $24 for 15ml

**Where did you purchase:** Essential Day Spa (US)

**Product claims:** *""Under eye 911! Dark circles - they can be a face emergency and they are often just a result of inadequate circulation to the fine and delicate under eye tissues.*

*DeVita offers the latest in cutting-edge technology providing the most effective level of vitamin K to assist in relieving the look of dark eye circles by encouraging circulation, as well as hesperidin for increased moisturization, and astaxanthin for powerful anti-oxidant protection.*

*This serum also helps to reduce the appearance of puffiness, fine lines, and wrinkles. It is the perfect under eye 911 treatment for those preferring a serum delivery system.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because I had a voucher and love that DeVita uses all natural actives in an aloe vera base.

**Your opinion:** I don't generally use products on the eye only so ended up using this all over my face! A watery serum that dries/ soaks in too fast, I felt a lot was wasted on my fingertips and, like most eye care products, it is outrageously priced for the size.

**Ingredients:** *""Aloe vera gel, green tea leaf extract, eyebright extract, vitamin E, zinc oxide, retinol, hesperidin, astaxanthin extract, vitamin K, hydroxymethylcellulose, potassium sorbate, grapeseed extract.""*",0,1413723050,null,0,1423013066,0,cldnish,t3_2jorf0,t1_cldnish,t1_cldnhn4,null,1426455904,2,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,2

false,electrikyle,null,null,"Sorry but this is one of my biggest pet peeves.  The term 'breaking the fourth wall' is a grossly misused figure of speech.

Breaking the fourth wall is when a character directly acknowledges the audience by looking in the camera, breaking the 'fourth' wall of the frame, the other three walls being the left and right sides and the background (like a stage play).  Examples could include the shower scene at the opening of Ferris Bueller, the projector room scene in Fight Club, or the moment in Hot Tub Time Machine where Craig Robinson says the name of the movie, *and then looks directly at camera.*  Deadpool famously does this all the time in the comics by looking/speaking directly at readers through the 'fourth wall' of the comic frame.  Or even The Doctor broke the fourth wall by wishing viewers at home a 'happy Christmas' in ""The Feast of Steven.""

But a fictional work referencing itself as a work of fiction does not necessitate a break of the fourth wall - unless the 'fourth wall' of the camera's lens has actually been acknowledged by any of the characters.

So, to be more specific - what we are seeing in this particular frame would be known as *metafiction* - of which breaking the fourth wall is one type - but this is not an actual break of the fourth wall.",0,1413723104,null,0,false,0,cldnj8h,t3_2jn3jw,t1_cldnj8h,t3_2jn3jw,null,1426455898,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

A Land Value Tax passed the House of Commons in 1910 led by Winston Churchill and Lloyd George but was vetoed by the Lords against the strong advice of the King himself that it should be passed.

false,BuboTitan,null,null,"&gt;Why is it no matter the nation, the people behind the medical claims are always dicks? 

One thing I have noticed, is that no one was a ""dick"" before they got this job. One physician came very excited about helping out soldiers, but after months on the job, got burned out (like the rest of us) after seeing so many ridiculous claims. Examples: one guy claiming PTSD because he was afraid he would be hurt in Afghanistan. But he had never even deployed!! Or a female claiming PTSD from sexual assault, even though the assault was only one incident of an unwanted kiss! I should add she also had numerous affairs with married guys while deployed, got pregnant, got busted for alcohol use on the job, and only claimed PTSD when she started to get in trouble for her behavior. The list goes on and on.

&gt;Did you ever experience war yourself? 

Yes, I have 21 years with the US Army and have deployed to Iraq twice, and Afghanistan once. I have been shot at, and encountered IEDs and suicide bombings. That experience is one requirement for being selected for this job. And it rubs me the wrong way when people who NEVER experienced any real combat, and where in no physical danger whatsoever, are claiming PTSD. 

&gt; mental health is complicated as fuck

Yes it is, and unfortunately a lot of people use that fact to help game the system. I should add that takes away significant resources from people who truly need help.

&gt;You seem to have some form of bias about it, excuses everywhere to why it isnt real or exaggerated.

If you were in my office I could sit you down and show you the case files (all online now) myself. Trust me, you would change your mind pretty quick. These claims in the UK Army could be a lot different, but my gut tells me they are exactly the same.

* *Proven anti-irritants reduce redness and soothe sensitive skin*

* *Helps fade red marks from past breakouts*

* *Enhances makeup application by making skin’s surface extremely smooth*

* *100% fragrance- and colorant-free*.""

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased as part of the PC Resist sample pack.

**Your opinion:** One sample lasted three or four applications (face and decollete) so a little goes a long way. I liked the short ingredients list: I have used all the other actives with no issue so this was a chance to test a known percentage of encapsulated retinol. Greasy on application, but the volatile silicone evaporate off leaving silky skin. I haven't experienced any irritation or adverse reaction even used twice a day or on irritated skin after microneedling. I will not purchase the full size because I am not keen on silicone heavy products.

OK, I'll clarify one thing. There is a difference between PTS and PTSD. **PTS** is a natural reaction to a stressful event. It happens to all of us, and it is normal. You see someone killed, or you even see things on TV that you don't like, you feel stressed. **PTSD**, on the other hand, is where the trauma is so bad, that you need treatment (and financial compensation of course) for the rest of your life. Because of the financial incentive involved, soldiers overwhelmingly claim PTSD.

Think about it this way. If, after just a year of hearing a few bombs go off in the distance is enough to claim PTSD (which many people do), then what about the Iraqis who live in the country? They see and hear this stuff routinely for decades, so by that reasoning, the entire country would be full of raving lunatics by now!

false,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"&gt; No group can claim to represent the entire working class.

This is true, but a group can exist to represent the *interests* of the working class even if working class individuals do not support that group. 

UKIP do not aim to represent the interests of the entire working class, therefore, to claim they are a working class party is part of their disingenuous PR campaign. The Tories are the same in this regard; historically by phrasing *the problem group* as benefits claimants or single mothers (targets that lack both the monetary and political capital to fight back the aggressive propaganda campaigns against them).

&gt; I'm pretty left of centre, and I agree immigration is good for the country. But if you're going to go to a small town (and they're not all in middle england there's plenty up north) where the influx of migrant workers with no sense of the local community, a different culture and often even a different language has been so great and rapid that local public services are strained and the inhabitants no longer recognise their own home town, and wages have been pushed down, and tell them there's no problem with the way immigration has been handled, and if they say there is then they're racist, then no wonder a party like UKIP starts to look attractive.

I agree with the reason UKIP exists, I just don't feel that its a fair assessment to say that they represent working classes - they have just managed to hit on reactionary views that become common as people become more sedentary and alienated.

I attribute a big part of the success with labour voters to the de-unionisation of working class towns. Unions used to be social clubs, cornerstones of the community that brought people together and allowed them to share common social and political goals. Where are they now? Sucked up into the official bureaucratic mechanisms of the corporate world and the modern labour party. Combine this with the fact that the labour party has, essentially, become another mouth for the corporate lobby and you have a perfect storm for trashing workers rights.

One reason labour is failing (and will either evolve or die) is because they adopted a liberal economic policy in the 1990s - the idea that business *in itself* can solve social problems. 

It can't because business doesn't exist to solve problems it exists to make profit. There is no reason an investor, given the choice of a making 20% profit on a housing plan in London, would instead try a more risky 6% potential profit in Hull, furthermore the market would quickly rule out any strategy that encouraged weak investment. As a consequence, after world war 2, the state used its enormous power to address this imbalance. 

To say that the lack of jobs and the imbalance in our economy is caused by immigration does far more harm than good because it makes people think there is a quick, easy solution to problems. There are other solutions  to improve workers rights that benefit just about everyone such as the introduction of a basic income and the reduction of the working week. Without strong community based political movements, though, this will never happened and instead we'll see an increase in illogical attack on workers rights as if it was slashing worker pay and reducing holidays that allowed the consumer spending boom of the 20th century (spoiler alert: it wasn't).

**Price of product:** ~90p for three 1.8ml samples

**Where did you purchase:** Paula's Choice

**Product claims:** ""*Contains a specialized complex of ingredients proven to remodel aging skin, bringing it to a healthier, more youthful state-really. The formula is packed with ingredients that work to build and preserve collagen, prevent moisture loss, restore essential ingredients to protect skin's barrier function, and reduce inflammation with potent antioxidants. The result? The skin you want to have, now!""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased as part of the PC Resist sample pack.

**Your opinion:** One sample lasted two uses (face and neck or decollete) so am applying more retinol with this than a serum. This is very light, yet hydrated my skin reasonably well when it felt a little tight after using an AHA product. Should be fine under make up. Have used all the other actives with no issue so this was a chance to test a known percentage of encapsulated retinol. I haven't experienced any irritation or adverse reaction even used twice a day or on irritated skin after microneedling. Love that it is not loaded with silicones but I will not purchase the full size because I am looking for a higher percentage of retinol.

**Price of product:** ~30p for one 4.4ml sample

**Where did you purchase:** Paula's Choice

**Product claims:** *""This treatment is one of makeup expert Wayne Goss' favourites.*

*RESIST Retinol Skin Smoothing Body Treatment with Antioxidants utilizes a specialized retinol complex, potent antioxidants, and skin-repairing ingredients to intensively smooth and firm skin all over the body. This silky, concentrated lotion has a rich texture that goes to work immediately to repair dry skin as well as give it the essential ingredients it needs to be silky soft. Soothing emollients and plant oils provide lasting, non-greasy moisture and an instant, healthy glow you’ll absolutely love.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased as part of the PC Resist sample pack.

**Your opinion:** The size of this sample combined with the percentage make it great value for money, especially since PC say it can be used on the face. Have used all the other actives with no issue so this was a chance to test a known percentage of encapsulated retinol. I really wanted to like this, but it stung the tiniest bit close to my eyes and subsequently made my eyes water. I suspect this is down to the pH of 6.

This is thicker than a regular moisturiser and I don't feel it would be that easy to spread if used on the body. Was surprised how matte the treatment went on, ended up feeling like a sunscreen, but that means it should work fine under make up and it did moisturise reasonably well. Sadly I will not purchase the full size due to the risk of irritation.

**Price of product:** ~£1.40 for two 1ml samples

**Where did you purchase:** Paula's Choice

**Product claims:** *""Skin Recovery Super Antioxidant Concentrate Serum contains a potent blend of antioxidants, cell-communicating ingredients, plant oils and anti-irritants. Each of these works quickly to revitalize lackluster skin so it can look and act healthier and younger. This elegant formula provides a barrier to help protect skin from everyday environmental damage.*

* *Effective for: Anti-aging, brown spots, eczema, redness, rosacea, wrinkles*

* *Helps repair damage and stimulate collagen production*

* *Your skin will feel wonderfully silky as dry, flaky patches vanish*

* *Formulated for use around the eyes*

* *Excellent as a foundation primer; helps makeup go on smoothly*

* *Clinically proven non-irritating*

* *100% fragrance and colorant-free*

* *No animal testing.*""

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased so I have tested all the PC antioxidant serums!

**Your opinion:** Most of the plant oils are present in tiny amounts (&lt;0.01%) so the description is somewhat disingenuous. This is a thick silky oil type serum, much more pleasant to use than the Resist Intensive Wrinkle Repair serum. It is easy to spread and penetrates quickly: I haven't experienced any irritation or adverse reaction. I will not purchase the full size at this time because I am looking for a much higher percentage of retinol, and I'm not 'wowed' by the ingredients list most of the antioxidants (including vitamin C) being &lt;0.01%.

**Ingredients:** *""Cyclopentasiloxane, dimethicone, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, olive fruit oil, vitamin E, retinol (0.01%), tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, bisabolol, astaxanthin extract, tocotrienols, adenosine, tetrahydrodemethoxydiferuloylmethane, tetrahydrobismethoxydiferuloylmethane, tetrahydrodiferuloylmethane, green tea leaf extract, grapeseed extract, German chamomile flower extract, uva ursi leaf extract, stearyl dimethicone, soybean oil, grapeseed oil, evening primrose oil, cranberry seed oil, raspberry seed oil, bilberry seed oil, palm oil, alcohol denat.

false,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"Its a shame you disagree with me about the working week.
Let me put it this way; if we reduce working hours as a state mandated rule (but keep pay just as high) companies are forced to adopt more optimal strategies of working. At the moment they are getting away with employing people for 8 hours or more whilst people are sat on facebook/reddit not doing a lot. This is partly because its basically impossible to sit at a desk and work for 8 hours solid on anything other than repetitive tasks. Furthermore, companies will have extra incentive to invest in mechanisation because the returns on said investment will be greater.

Combine this with the fact that every time there has been a historical reduction in working hours it has been followed by a huge consumer spending boom resulting in massive growth. Case studies include Henry Ford, inventing the 40 hour week which encouraged forms of mass production that resulted in the introduction of an affordable car. The secondary consequence was that people had leisure time and so bought cars.

Another example is the introduction of summer bank holidays in the Victorian era which allowed the explosion of British tourism creating seaside holiday towns like Blackpool, Weston-super-mare, Thanet, Brighton... (the list here is huge). 

When people say we need to work more hours there is no historical evidence to suggest that this will improve our economy, whereas working less has repeatedly improved the conditions and lives of working people. The bad news is that it has never happened without strong workers movements. 
I almost hope UKIP get power just to demonstrate how backward thinking their policies are and foster a strong workers movement that argues for the reduction of labour time.",0,1413728064,null,0,false,0,cldov5k,t3_2jm1ai,t1_cldov5k,t1_cldoajq,null,1426455277,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

He's much more than that. He's a very intelligent player, he makes space for other players with great runs off the ball, he links up perfectly with David, he has a great delivery on either foot, and he has actually developed the ability to beat his man with a trick or feint or two. And, he's strong on either foot. He also has great versatility, and the ability to play in several positions - again, due to his intelligence.

His dribbling is underrated. He doesn't have the eye catching pace of some wide players, or their ability to dribble at pace. But he's more than competent with the ball at his feet, and even committing a defender now and then.

But his greatest strength of course, is his work rate. When you couple that with his intelligence, ease of which to link up with other players, and his selfless attitude, always putting the team first, then you have yourself a very, very good player.

false,pja,cnty-uk,The middle bit,"I remember reading somewhere that motivation is a very finite resource - if you have to push yourself every time to do thing X, whatever thing X is, then you will run out of mental energy very quickly &amp; either quit doing thing X or find that having done thing X you have no mental ""push"" left to do things Y,W &amp; Z which are just as important.

Given that we all have this limited resource of ""mental push"", even those of us who would be regarded as being psychologically in fine fettle, if we had to make ourselves do stuff every day then none of us would ever get very much done!

So how do ordinary people do all this everyday stuff without draining their mental batteries? IIRC the answer is that for those people they're habits that don't require any mental energy to make them happen. Instead of pushing themselves to do every single task, they see themselves as people who ""do thing X at time Y"", whatever thing X is, so if it's time Y, then they must be doing thing X because what else would they be doing then?

It's that shift in self-perception that makes the difference in other words - reserving your motivational push reservoir for those times when it's really needed. It's a very Buddhist attitude really - don't worry about how you feel about yourself, or how others perceive you &amp; just live in the moment &amp; if this is moment Y, well then it's time to do thing X!

So don't be so hard on yourself for lacking the motivation to do all this stuff, because *nobody* has the motivation to drive themselves to do all the stuff they do every day. Thinking you can ""force yourself"" to do stuff is the short path to failure and a cycle of self-recrimination. Try and re-frame yourself as 'that person who does thing X' and do it despite yourself. I'll admit that this can be a tricky thing to pull off, but if you can manage it, the results might surprise you. Start with just one thing &amp; be the person that does that thing: Maybe you're the person that goes for a walk every morning?

I didn't have a problem with him until now, because at least he was trying and sometimes that’s all you can do but when someone doesn’t show the will to win or to even play in his case, well that’s just about all the support I can give him.

We were shite today. No pressing off the ball, bad decision-making on the ball - we spent the entire first half playing like Stoke except instead of a big target man up top we've got Balotelli on his own. QPR have been awful this season and deserve to be bottom of the table, and yet also fully deserved to win today. We were massively lucky that they missed the chances they did, because they really should have been 4-0 up and out of sight when we got our first goal.

Usually we're the ones wasting chances and losing games to stupid goals when we should have won by miles, not the other way around. In over 15 years of watching Liverpool I can't recall a game that we've won where I felt this much that we deserved to lose. We did well to fight back when they equalised twice, but that's the only positive I can take from that game. 

And the funniest thing is that if QPR had just let the ball go through to Balotelli instead of deflecting it in for two own goals, I wouldn't have put money on him to have scored either of them given how bad his finishing was that game.

This is a bit more complicated than that,

&gt;I understand that this is in response to changing demographics and a fear of Sinn Fein becoming the largest party, but it also highlights just how little choice there is in unionism.

Actually there is loads of choice in unionism, that's the problem with first past the post elections, if there is more diversity in one end of the spectrum there is a risk of an unrepresentative candidate being elected. And given Sinn Fein's policy of abstention it means that people actually have a say in the house.

&gt;The UUP could attempt to take advantage of a self destructive DUP by proposing their own unique policies and attempting to eventually replace them as the largest unionist party.

Which is why we are running candidates in open fights everywhere else, and have made a public pledge to bring in a private members bill that will create an official opposition at Stormont.

&gt;Instead, they're propping up the DUP, showing absolutely no opposition, 

In North Belfast, and only North Belfast.

&gt;and making the nationalist parties look good in the process.

Post Match Thoughts

Can we all just agree to ignore that first match performance? Okay cool.

Balotelli played *way* better after missing his sitter. He still should've have two or three goals, but he had some great chances and would've been there to finish the winner had Caulker not scored the own goal. Going forward, Coutinho and Allen were great substitutions to make. Allen was able to control the midfield and Coutinho... The little magician definitely performed a few magic tricks at the end of the game there. Sterling was great, wish he could've been rested but we needed him for this game.  Mignolet had a really good game in my opinion, had some great saves.

Okay, those are the good things. Bad: Our defense. Johnson was the best of the back four in my opinion, he set up the move for the first own goal. Lovren and Skrtel didn't seem like they knew what they were doing, and Enrique got beaten on the dribble repeatedly, and gave the ball away just from misplaced passes *way* too much.

In those last few goals you could see how much better and more natural the players felt all charging up the pitch together at lightning pace, and it resulted in 2 goals for fuck sake. Instead for 80 minutes we had patient passing, no imagination, and rigid structure. I'm not sure if it's a managerial decision by Brendan to stick tight and secure as if he doesn't trust the guys without Sturridge or Suarez in the team to play the lightning football, but they can clearly do it. The rigidity isn't even working anyway, we leak more than a crusty hookers cunt.

Raheem is back influencing games.

However, my interest in seeing him get an uninterrupted run of league starts before Kane stems both from my faith in his talents if he's given a *fair* shake, and my frustration with what I regard as the club's failure to recognize and supplement his footballing acumen properly over the past 16 months effectively risking a good footballer's entire career.

Soldado was a poacher brought into a system under AVB that had no use for poachers.  Now a player can (and should) be flexible enough to adapt his style to fit his squad's needs, and Soldado gamely spent much of last year trying to play the way AVB wanted.  But for better or worse, a 28-29 year old striker is not going to have the flexibility of style that a 21-22 year old might, and as a result Soldado languished while trying his hardest to do what was requested of him - and then, when we got rid of AVB, he spent most of the last half of the season on the bench as Adebayor (justifiably) came in from the cold under Sherwood.

Then we dump Sherwood, hire Poch, and Soldado still spends most of his time during league matches on the bench.  This was his first league start all season; before yesterday, he hadn't played more than 45 combined minutes in the league *all season*.  During that same period, Adebayor scored only 1 goal in 8 games, back in August.  I firmly believe that if Soldado is shown as much patience as Ade's been shown, he'll prove what he can give to this squad.  He has good link-up and assisting play, he's energetic, he's un-selfish, has good positional awareness about himself and other attacking players moving forward, doesn't complain or whinge about lack of playing time - and perhaps most importantly, he truly seems to love Tottenham.  I think he deserves another real, fair chance.

Now, I agree that Kane may be in the best form of the three of them right now.  A team's job is to win matches, and if Kane gives us the best shot at doing that, so be it.  But I think Kane is young, and patient, and if Soldado doesn't impress by the end of the year then I will be 100% on the Kane Train for match starts.  Right now my starting preference would be Soldado (most/all league matches) &gt; Kane (off the bench and cup matches) &gt; Adebayor (Europa and cup matches until he gets a fire in him again).

Balotelli: I've always supported him but today it was really hard. He always slows down play when he gets the ball, he doesn't just go after without over thinking. He shoots right away, from impossible angles, its extremely frustrating.
Not to mention his sulking and attitude, he doesn't just stfu and get on with it. If there's a 50-50 challenge, you can almost guarantee that Balotelli won't win because he never goes 100%. Yea its his style or whatever, but he has to be more aggressive.
The biggest thing is that he doesn't fucking score, he could be whining all day long as long as he scores. He's had a few sitters that he never even looked like scoring. 

Some players get angry when they miss and it motivates them more. But for Balotelli I feel like he gets all depressed and just ruins his performance more and more, every missed shot or pass builds up his frustration and he just shuts down. He wouldn't be able to score a tap in by the end of it, he needs to get his head right.

Enrique: He looks a lot slower and less impressive than last year, he's coming back from injury and we've been spoiled by the attacking skills of Moreno.

Migs: Some great saves and some awful mistakes, he's inconsistent as always.

Johnson: He's played really well, one of the better players out there today.

Gerrard new (old) role: Just bullshit, he doesn't have the legs to do it any more. He wasn't in the game at all until he moved back in the 2nd half. 
He looked good a few weeks ago in that position because it was the end of the game and Liverpool was already in control, he can't play there early on. 

Defense: Just can't handle set pieces at all, it really is a fucking joke. ANY TEAM can lump the ball into our box and they'd score, absolutely no confidence or authority at all, it really is disturbing how easy it is for other teams to score.

The housing will be a problem, and there's nothing I can do about it.

Coutinho was great. The commentators were slating him for the thing with the free kick at the end but I don't think that's really fair, he was giving the team the chance to get back and defend, there was logic to it. Hope he starts against Real. Sterling was also pretty good.

Negatives: 

Pretty much everything else. Defending was absolutely abysmal. No 2 ways about it, their 2nd goal was just all round incompetence on our defending. 

Gerrard in that forward role didn't work, you know why? It works when the other team are tired, he has more space then. Don't start him there, push him up with 20-30 minutes to go. 

Balotelli...fucking hell I've defended him from my friends criticisms for so long but today even I couldn't defend him. He should've scored, arguably twice. That open goal is inexcusable. Then the random runs and shots for no reason. I understand he's frustrated and wants to get a goal but you don't do it by taking awful shots from 30 yards out. You do it by taking your chances like the fucking open goal. So selfish, could've had a very good chance but instead looked for the penalty. Not a good day for him at all. I just hope BR sorts him out.

However, Balo can still prove to be a good investment. We've all seen the talent he has--we just need a way to tap it out of him consistently. I've never seen a striker with so much natural talent not be sure of how to use it. To begin, he needs to be more clinical and take less shots. There's nothing wrong with slowing down a fast counter if you've got no chance on goal. 

There were a few times today vs. QPR when Mario shot no matter what on a counter. Instead, he could have passed to Lallana, Hendo, or Raheem. I'm sure that part of it is just because he's so anxious to score in the league, but part of it is also because he's still a somewhat selfish player and that's an aspect that needs to be worked on. 

Mario himself has said he plays best with another striker alongside him. When Sturridge gets back, I'm sure Mario will also improve. His best game so far for us was probably vs. Spurs when Sturridge was there. Another problem is the 4-2-3-1 we're playing which doesn't fit our players AT ALL. We're much better in a 4-diamond-2 or 4-3-3, but BR seems set to play the 4-2-3-1 for some reason. 

I'm not saying we should drop him vs. Real Madrid, but I'd seriously consider putting Lambert in the starting 11. He's more selfless and I'm sure he'd be really motivated.

If you read past the headline and scaremongering about relative numbers of votes in Parliament and the Commission (I mean honestly - the EU has gotten bigger, it's impossible for everybody to keep the same voting power while allowing new members to exercise their rights. Think about it!) to the end of the article, you'll see this, which is long the lines of what I was going to reply with anyway:

&gt;But a spokesman for the Foreign Secretary disputed the methodology used by Business for Britain, pointing out votes against were usually only recorded when a vote was likely to be pushed through.

&gt;He said: ‘This report is not accurate. The Council of Ministers usually only vote when there is a qualified majority in favour so, by definition, if the UK is opposed on an issue that goes to a vote we are going to lose.’

&gt;The spokesman added: ‘The report doesn’t look at the countless times we have worked with allies behind the scenes to block proposals that are not in British interests, or to negotiate changes to turn them to our advantage.

**Product claims:** *An intensive anti-ageing gel, Overnight Wrinkle Fix works through the night to hydrate, smooth + revitalise the complexion.*

**About you:** Oily, closed comedone prone skin. Daily acid (AHA/BHA) user. So far I know I'm sensitive to niacinamide, but so far nothing else!

**Your opinion:** Um. This is amazing. I'd heard about 'the purge' with Vitamin A that could go on for months, so I stayed away. Then I saw this on offer and splurged having no idea what it did. Now I know it's amazing, it's no longer on offer!

I had a faulty one which I returned and I got the last one as a replacement. I wish so badly that I'd just kept the faulty one (the only problem was the pump). 

I don't know about all the anti aging because I'm not worried about that, but my god did it sort out my acne. I've been dealing with hormonal acne, stress acne, a skin reaction to a Benton product and a skin reaction to niacinamide (sobs), so while not actually horrific, it's been a bumpy (haha) ride these past few months. The moment I introduced this though, I could see things getting much much better. I've used it for two weeks now, and the results are amazing. I used it every other day for a week and only in the areas where I had active acne. It did get a little worse before it got better, but it was bad anyway, so it was a calculated risk. 

I would absolutely repurchase.

&gt;__A113__ (sometimes __A-113__ or __A1-13__) is an [inside joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-joke), an [Easter egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media\)) in [animated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation) films created by alumni of [California Institute of the Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_the_Arts), referring to the classroom used by graphic design and character animation students including [John Lasseter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lasseter) and [Brad Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Bird). [Brad Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Bird) first used it for a license plate number in the ""[Family Dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Dog_(TV_series\)#Original_episode)"" episode of *[Amazing Stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazing_Stories_(TV_series\))*. It has appeared in other [Disney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company) movies and every [Pixar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar) movie.

&gt;Bird said, ""I put it into every single one of my films, including my *[Simpsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons)* episodes—it's sort of my version of [Hirschfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hirschfeld)'s 'Nina.'""

However strikers can go cold and he was the one in position to cause both own goals (granted he didn't know what was happening on the first goal either).  You can tell he is in his own head and having the main striker go down and having to take the mantle so soon to getting to the club can cause that.  Trust me I'm just as frustrated but I'd prefer to keep him going and hope he can get it under control and get his confidence up.  I think if he can find the net it'll flip a switch and honestly just having a striker off shouldn't be causing us this much trouble versus teams like QPR.  The whole team is off and hanging it on Balo is a bit unfair.

Yes he missed a sitter and yes he took some selfish shots but the entire team played piss poor 90% of the game.  Honestly mignolet probably was man of the match as we should have been down by at least 3 goals.  He made a number of top saves and wasn't responsible for the two that went in.

On that note if you want to hang a player out to dry it should be Enrique.  He gave the ball away and put the cbs under pressure a number of times and then just left Vargas to run straight in and get a free header.

We have to get better all around but calling out Balo isn't going to make him start finishing.  He'll play vs Madrid,  or at least should.  Then maybe get a rest for Hull.  We need to stop playing on the back foot versus every team.  We should have taken it to QPR but we sat back for whatever reason.

RTD has stated out-of-universe that the Cardiff rift closed with the cracks (and by ""closed"", I assume that this would mean was never there, with the consequence that the reason for Torchwood 3 being there at all, and all the incursions through it, never happened).

One can infer (although without any definite statement, in or out of universe), that the Cyberking incident happened - and then did not - in London because the Cybermen returning through the breach was also dependent on the cracks being there or not being there, which in turn suggests that the breach was originally related to the cracks.

True, there were quite a few unionist parties standing, but I meant choice in terms of ideology. You're really just choosing between different shades of conservatism. That parties can agree an election pact based on the issue of sovereignty seems absurd, and highlights just how close together they are ideogically.

Personally, I've given votes to the Green Party, Sinn Fein, the SDLP and, occasionally, the Alliance Party over the years. I haven't voted for any unionist parties, not simply because they're unionist, but because of their ultra conservative stance on issues like equal marriage, amongst others. NI21 marketed themselves differently, but they never really stood for anything - at least nothing Alliance or the Greens haven't already covered.

&gt; Perhaps they should follow Irish nationalism and give voters two choices: murderers or non-murderers.

Because no members of the DUP or PUP were ever involved in paramilitaries....

We're meant to be in a post-troubles era. I try to vote for candidates who I hope will at least try to make society better.

false,Firefox7275,null,null,"The requirement for sunscreen in winter is dependent on a number of factors: how much exposure you get, how strong the AHA is, what the UV index is for example.

A weak AHA product will not appreciably increase UV sensitivity, and darker skin is always better protected than paler skin due to the extra melanin pigment.

Also consider your dietary intake of bioavailable vitamin D - see sidebar for our sunscreen Wiki.

**ETA** study of 10% glycolic at pH 3.5 *on Caucasians* increased UV sensitivity. Note that MED is 'minimal erythema dose', or 1.5 times what is required to get a light sunburn. Unless you work or do lengthy exercise sessions outdoors you would struggle to get anywhere near that on most UK winter days.

But to be honest, the two aren't really comparable; if they were, renewable sources would undoubtedly ruin the landscape. [We need a solar array the size of one red square](http://www.withouthotair.com/c25/page_179.shtml) *in a desert* using *concentrating solar power* to power the UK. Energy density and land use are very important factors to consider. 

If solar generation was a serious prospect for the UK's energy balance, people would be against it just as much. Serious generation from renewables requires an industrialisation of the landscape that people both aren't aware of and wouldn't want to put up with. To put into context, the size of that red square above is 21025 square kilometers. ~~The land area of England is [only 135 square kilometers](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_en-GBGB447GB447&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=size%20of%20england)~~ (well, I ballsed that one up. My point is, NIMBYs are going to be pissed whatever, the size of the red square is the same as the size of Wales). 

Arguably the most popular renewable source in the country at the moment is wind. A big resource, yes, [but it's nowhere near enough](http://www.withouthotair.com/c4/page_33.shtml). Again, serious industrialisation of the landscape is required if we are to replace those ugly power stations with renewable sources. 

Just to be clear, I'm all for clean energy and diversification from fossil fuels. But I understand what that entails, and I'm afraid a lot of people, including policy makers, do not. I highly recommend you read [Without the Hot Air](http://www.withouthotair.com/Contents.html), do not accept token gestures of environmentalism from government (as the page above says, covering 10% of the country in wind farms will not even provide us with enough energy to power half of the UK's cars) and use your vote appropriately if this is the kind of change you want to see.

Some people do!  Some people even have the BMW beforehand, but that's besides the point.

&gt; If you're earning, say, £30K a year and you have a £25K deposit then you could buy a place for ~£160K. 

You sure about that?  The amount you can buy for seems a bit generous, but the salary and deposit are about right for me.

&gt; The mortgage repayments on a £135K mortgage are ~£670.38 per month, on a 5 year fixed FTB mortgage at 4.59% with 85% LTV. This was literally no shopping around. Longest fixed mortgage on the natwest site..

Okay, I'm confused.  I'd be paying £154 pcm until the fixed period ends then it goes up to £670.38?

&gt; Anyway, of that £670.38 mortgage repayment £154 will be going into paying off the debt. 

Why's it a £670.38 repayment if only £154 is going into paying off the debt?  Is it the same as above?

&gt; So if your current rent is more than £516

Yup.  Mine is £580, but I also pay water rates directly on top and pay single occupancy council tax myself - so it's approximately £680 just to keep the roof over my head before any other bills.

&gt; Assuming you had been saving £694.44 each month for the past 3 years to make that £25K deposit

The £25K is money I've accrued up over a lifetime.  

I've had a full time professional career for two years now and am making big inroads myself by saving, but earlier parts of it were inheritance and various small windfalls.  Currently I'm saving between £350-£500 a month myself, and usually get an annual bonus of around £3000 or so depending on various performance factors.  The bonus is immediately saved 100% and I don't touch it.

Does that count?  I'm currently restructuring my finances and restricting my outgoings as much as possible to increase the amount I can save.  I also aim to acquire a female in the future and double my (our) buying power.

&gt; if you keep up with that level of saving by the end of the 5 year fixed rate you will have saved an additional £41,666. Add onto that the £9,240 of paying down your mortgage you'd have paid off £50,906 of your mortgage and you'll now have £75,906 of equity in your flat. 

By this, do you mean I could use the saved money to overpay a huge chunk of the mortgage at the end of the five year period and thus have more equity in the flat, to be freed up later if I decided to sell?

&gt; Not taking into account the savings you'll make from paying £694.44 instead of whatever your rent is.. Usually rent is higher than a mortgage. 

But my rent is less than that, so how is this a saving?

Sorry for sounding like a dumbass.

&gt; Previous to 2010 Solar Panel grants were paid in a grant format but now this has changed to a ‘feed in tariff’ payment for self-use and contribution to the grid

As I'm a private renter, I don't have much reason to look at the names. It would seem that the Feed-In Tariff has only been around for four years. Unless it was around before that, when the Gov't was issuing lump sum grants, I'd say that doesn't really count as always.

&gt; There are 25 million homes in the UK and a reasonable % of houses have south, south-west or south-east facing roofs. We have a couple of hundred thousand installations completed. 

Wouldn't that suggest the strategy is working? Even 25 million is a finite number. consider if solar was cheap and easy to install. Everyone and his grandson would be after a quick buck by slapping panels on everyone's roof. Then, when 10 million little installation companies had ripped the fur from their hides chasing their 15 customers each, they all go bust due to the huge and immediate lack of customers.

Because the bank needs to make money. £154 goes to paying off the £135,000 of debt, the rest is a payment to the bank for giving you the mortgage. It's the interest you're paying on the loan. 

If you seriously want a property I very much suggest you talk to an independent mortgage advisor. They'll help guide you through the process and tell you how much you can afford to spend on a property. 

Ask them what your budget will be if the mortgage payments are the same as your current rent. 

As for the latter part of my above post.. Basically, where you were throwing rent into a financial black hole and never seeing it again you will instead be paying a mortgage, of which a percentage of that will pay off your debt. That's money in the bank presuming house prices stay the same or go up. 

So in areas where rents are higher than mortgages it almost always makes sense to buy if you can. Assuming you don't buy a lemon that needs tons of repairs. ",0,1413735663,null,0,false,0,cldrorx,t3_2jn3ss,t1_cldrorx,t1_cldrayd,null,1426453907,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Solar panels are just one source of energy, which should be used in combination of others. To rely on one energy source would be madness so should be used along with wind, hydro, geothermal, energy from waste, biofuel, nuclear and coal (and any other sources which are a viable option). Depending on the geographical location and feasibility of each energy source in that location. But where possible we should reduce our use of the coal based  &amp; fossil fuel based energy sources as much as we can.

Also having solar panels at source for providing energy means less energy would be needed over all, as less energy needs to taken from grid and so less energy loss through transmission and distribution along the power lines.

Fer, Sandro and Henry looked to be exactly what the doctor ordered in midfield. With those guys playing we are comfortable with the ball, able to spread it nicely. And that was without Barton and Faurlin. Very auspicious, but also very foreboding that Sandro went off, as kinners said.

Playing with two strikers looked a formula for success as well. What we lacked in width we made up for with Zamora's ability to hold the opposition off and spread the ball.

Sterling is fucking young and Rodgers leans on him like a crutch. I saw my own baseball career ended because I was my teams best pitcher by a mile and my coach was only thinking about the present. And when you're that young you can't think about your future. You don't even realize your body has limits.

The good thing about Raheem is that it seems he does realize. The bad thing is he's currently being managed by two guys who are more, somewhat justifiably, more concerned with their job security than they are with helping the lad onto a great career. For England and us I'd argue it's inexcusable. We've just got young talented players who play in his position that we should be able to blood the way we blooded him.

The idea that Raheem needs to play against QPR is astonishing. But then you look at our performance and see that he was the reason for all 3 of our goals. Which is fucking ridiculous. 

When you consider how awful we're playing, we wouldn't be hurt by resting Raheem for the first 70 minutes and using him as an impact sub. 


As for the comparisons to Ronaldo? Ronaldo was able to slowly ascend to the mantle of club talisman. He was surrounded by the best players in the country and that allowed him to grow. He wasn't asked to do everything. If he had been I doubt he'd be where he is now. Rodgers and Co need to consider this. We need to bring more quality into the first 11. Whether that means we just take Gerrard off so that our team is more dynamic could involve not signing someone for midfield.

Re. closed comedones..I'm not sure they are because they don't linger. They will come up overnight and leave within a few days, and are red not flesh coloured. Still, its definitely a possibility. They also don't seem to have any correlation with my cycle either, and I can go months having lovely skin and then a couple where it isn't so good.

I use stridex which helps alot! And I have bought some Avene Cleanance K for an AHA, but I think i'll wait to introduce it until my skin has cleared up a little with the Zineryt. 

I find dermatology so fascinating, because your skin is an indication of so many things...your gut, your thyroid, hormones as well as influences from the outside. It does make it frustrating, of course, trying to figure out which of those or indeed which combination is causing an individual breakout and on an individual person! Still, we can try right?!

I had severe self esteem issues for a long time and I'd be lying if I said I don't still have some issues, but learning guitar provided a challenging experience which had various achievable goals I could reach to boost my self esteem as I progressed over the years (for free!!!), and then once you get to the point where you're really good you can walk away from a session and have something to feel good about yourself every day for the rest of your life and like +50 sexy points too

If I get into a self conscious mood I'll turn on the amp and shred along to some of my favourite tunes and afterwards I'll feel really high and chilled out and walk away thinking ""you know maybe I don't completely suck"" - no matter what I'll always have that guitar there waiting for me to give me a boost whenever I need it. So I didn't get that job, my date stopped replying to me, I don't feel sexy, my life is shit, but I'll always be able to pick up my guitar, do my thing, and walk away feeling good... at least for a little while 

Getting good on an instrument is a great way to boost self esteem permanently, or just a little pick me up if you're feeling deflated or defeated one day, and it's a great way to blow off steam and get high too. Low self esteem comes from feeling inferior, unaccomplished, average, not sexy, not charismatic, nothing interesting you can tell people at parties or job interviews. Learning an instrument changes all of that, and the better you get, the more effective it becomes . 

While you're working on losing weight and boosting your self esteem that way, you could try learning an instrument as well so if you feel like you aren't achieving your weight goals and seeing change there, you can at least feel good about progressing on an instrument or some other skill and achieving goals there, which might help keep your self esteem afloat as you work towards losing weight which is much harder and takes longer to see the results and subsequently makes it harder to maintain motivation to keep it up, whereas with instruments and other skills like programming or learning languages you can see daily or weekly progress and boost self esteem easily ",0,1413737293,null,0,1413737987,0,cldsdpt,t3_2jnxgs,t1_cldsdpt,t1_cldlk9d,null,1426453585,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

* *100% reported appearance of fine lines and wrinkles improved*

* *97% reported evenness of skin tone, and skin texture, improved*

* *93% reported their skin appeared vibrant &amp; healthy-looking*

* *90% reported skin appeared renewed and firmness improved.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because this serum has by far the highest percentage of encapsulated retinol for the lowest price.

**Your opinion:** US eBay seller pupin1 mailed out the package within a few hours of purchase which is pretty impressive, and I suspect they undercharged for postage and packing. Arrived well packaged and labelled as fragile, didn't get stung for customs so each 12ml bottle cost me an incredible $10.

I love the short ingredients list: cyclopentasiloxane is a volatile silicone so should evaporate off, leaving the remaining ingredients, most of which are actives. Was hoping it would lend itself to diluting to 0.5% or 1%, giving me five 24ml or 36ml serums/ creams.

Ended up using this serum at full strength over my entire face neck and decollete and I have not experienced any irritation nor dryness. My initial bugbear was that the texture is so watery that the serum is difficult to apply - I have ended up applying dropwise directly to the skin and spreading with fingertips of the opposite hand.

The first 12 ml bottle lasted around the six week mark with the last week to ten days of that being much more liberal including on the back of my hands. Second to fourth bottles lasted four weeks of liberal use. I'm actually appreciating the watery texture now, that makes it easy to be frugal and my skin doesn't feel overloaded with products. My skin is generally very soft and the tone has evened out substantially but bear in mind I am using other products loaded with actives.

**Ingredients:** *""Cyclopentasiloxane, squalane, retinol (1.5%), ascorbyl palmitate, vitamin E, water, pentylene glycol, polysorbate 20, lecithin, bisabolol, alcohol.""*

She was in hospital for 5 days before she died, suffering more than I've ever seen a person suffer. It was the worst 5 days of my life and when she died it was actually a relief.

Thought we were great in the opening ~25 minutes, then completely hit-or-miss for the rest of the game. I think that's what the Britannia does to teams. 

Deserved to go up 1-0, didn't think the second penalty was worth a penalty. Their second goal was class, and I think in the end, both teams deserved a draw.

Thought Tom Carroll looked out of his depth at times, but for the most part, played very well. We were lacking Jonjo's deep ball today though, and it showed. 

Upset with the way Fernandez performed. Seemed like he just couldn't play feet if they weren't within 20 yards of him. 

Thought Bony played well, but he showed some rust. Occasional first touch was off. Scored a great penalty, wish he would have taken some more chances.

Overall, thought we played well enough for a draw, not a win. I think the chances were there for us, we were just skeptical to take them. We had a few chances to hit the ball first time but instead tried to take another touch for the ""perfect hit."" Credit Stoke, they got a foot in there before we could get that perfect strike off.

Player of the day, for me, was Ki. Thought he commanded the midfield well, tracked back and saved our asses a couple of times. Made a bonehead foul that could've cost a goal, but that's the kind of day it was. Don't think anyone played better than a 7/10.

**Key Points:**

-We could have been 3-0 up in the first 30. We HAVE to be more clinical.

-Stoke is a team of cunts. Fouls, dives, time wasting. We are all guilty of all 3, but Stoke is more guilty than the rest of us. 

-I thought the ref lost control of the game at points allowing incessant fouling

-Siggy looked good at the beginning, I think fatigue got to him though.

-I hope Moses' hairline continues to recede. Abysmal decision, disgusting dive.

-Montero is dynamite

-Gomis needs to step it up, early hope is slowly fading.

-Our marking was simply unacceptable. Blocking shots saved us many times, but we can't rely on that. When we couldn't block the shot they simply scored.

**Conclusion:**

On the plus side our form seems to be consistent, on the negative we are not clinical at all. We squander 2-3 clear cut chances a match and seem to trail off every second half. If we can turn first half momentum to full game dominance and get our strikers firing we will be able to challenge for 7th or 8th.

Some good points about Gerrard though, and I agree Gerrard's performance as a number 10 did not warrant his inclusion in the side, not even close. Moved back to the base his passing was good but suspect defensively, similar to other games this season.

This week we have 3 games sunday to saturday. If Rodgers still refuses to consider leaving gerrard on the bench or evem subbing him off when we have good options to replace him it really would be getting a bit ridiculous.

Edit: I actually agree with rodgers when he said his long passing isnt as effective without Suarez in particular. Its not so much whether a player is available to receive the pass, its whether theyre in a good position to do something with it. Suarez thrived on being isolated, fighting for thr ball with defenders or running at players. Sturridge to some degree, sterling not as much, he works better with short passes and combination play which is better served by short passes through midfield and moving up the pitch as a unit. Balotelli doesnt suit long balls at all really.

So yeah I agree with both you and rodgers. I agree that gerrard playing deep is less effective without suarez, but really he should have just left him out and played Lucas instead rather than playing him instead of a better attacker.",0,1413738788,null,0,1413739778,0,cldt2ag,t3_2jpbbg,t1_cldt2ag,t3_2jpbbg,null,1426453206,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

The overall point being that the little red square is a pretty large area of land when you look at it compared to the size of the UK (we need to fill Wales with completely with solar panels to generate enough electricity for the whole country).

&gt;Funny I didn't say to generate all the UK power from solar sources alone.

I know you didn't. All I'm doing is pointing out that big generation is needed to make a dent in the generating capacity of the UK grid; microgeneration is no good. 

&gt;Just that using roof space would reduce the need for solar farms to be built in the first place.

Except it doesn't. My point was that it's insignificant in the context of the bigger picture. You can put solar panels on all the public buildings you want, a serious commitment in terms of money and land area needs to be made to make the switch to renewable energy. 

&gt;Solar panels are just one source of energy, which should be used in combination of others. To rely on one energy source would be madness

Which is why if you read [Without the Hot Air](http://withouthotair.com) you can have a look at the various renewable energy generation options available to us which actually add up. A mix is vital, at no point was I advocating purely solar generation. 

We need a balance, yes. But to do so with an emphasis on renewable energy requires a serious industrialisation of the countryside, and a few token solar panels on roofs will do very little to address the problem.

false,JB_UK,null,null,"I think Farage reflects the wider state of public debate in the UK, in exactly the same way as Boris Johnson. Political discussion is dominated by entertainment, whether that be the tabloids, HIGNFY, Spitting Image, The Thick Of It, Yes Minister, etc. Even 'high brow' news reporting is often glorified gossip about who's in, who's out. The discussion about what the real problems are and the different ways you can solve them is shunted to the side, or else heavily tied in with 'he said she said' pointing of fingers between political parties, which is really just done for form's sake, and very boring for everyone involved.

In this environment, personality is the most important factor - people like Farage or Johnson could come along with almost any political opinion, and become popular. The principle purpose of Farage's party is to do with Europe, but when asked, most people (including UKIP supporters) say they do not care much about Europe. Far more important is the way that denouncing the EU (which is by anyone's standard a tortured compromise, and for that reason somewhat incomprehensible and over-complicated) plays into Farage's symbolic role as a common sense man, someone who knows what he wants, and isn't afraid to say it, and who is a bit of a laugh, as an antidote to boring apparatchik politicians, mass produced at Oxford or in North London. He is a man who fits perfectly in the existing structures of political discussion - the superficial theatre of Question Time, the rough and tumble of the tabloids, even short, snappy rhetorical turns-of-phrase on Youtube. Farage and Johnson, it seems to me, are the sort of people who could feasibly stand in for their own Spitting Image puppets, which, at the least, means they are not boring.

Lambert is a poor man's Balo (someone coined that, so yes I'm stealing this from the WWW). Both Balo and Lambert are big physical presences who can make good use of space. The problem? There is absolutely no space creation at the moment. 

I personally understand the Borini dilemma because I've watched him play quite a bit. So the problem is we can't play Lambert alongside Balo because then we'd have two rigid physical attackers in front of Coutinho and being flanked by Hendo and Sterling. Sturridge works so well in here because his runs pull defenders in and out creating space for Coutinho, a winger, or the other striker, Balo. Borini doesn't have a tactical understanding of space. You can often find him out of position, maybe he's working hard, but working hard doesn't equate to working right. 

4-2-3-1 needs to work and I get why Rodgers is doing it. There are gonna be games where we'll need the extra player in midfield. There are gonna be games where we'll only have one option for striker. We need a stable go-to formation when this happens. Last season our 4-3-3 had 2 strikers and it worked well because it had two strikers.

Some particular points :
- not the 1st time the doctor use a companion as a human camera like Eleven did with Rory in ""The Girl Who Waits"" but I don't remember if he used the same nanothing. Like in this episod, the doctor remote direct the companion from its Tardis.
- the Doctor line towards the Boneless is reminiscent to 11 speaking with the Atraxis in ""The 11th hour""
- the siege mode"", never saw it before (even if he looked like a miniature version of the Pandorica) I don't know if it appears in the classic series but 9 has said to Rose than even Gengis Khan horde could not enter the Tardis if they wanted to
- the doctor saying that it's not always the good people who survive, call back to ""Voyage of the Damned""
- Clara still lying to Danny, I think it will soon become an issue for her
- Missy thinking out loud having chosen well Clara must confirm she is the one to have given her the Doctor's number
- soundtrack is very good, the 12th theme played at the very accurately dramatic moment 
- Clara is this episode's doctor. She insist that the doctor recognizes she has done very well but he said this has nothing to do with goodness, thanks for the various redditor I read to help me understand why

false,zombiesatemycat,cnty-england,England,"""I know you didn't. All I'm doing is pointing out that big generation is needed to make a dent in the generating capacity of the UK grid; microgeneration is no good.""

Microgeneration as a main source of energy would be no good. Which is not what's being advocated. Microgeneration can be used as a way of supplementing energy supply to businesses and households. Reducing their need to take all their energy from the grid, thus reducing some of the pressure for more solar farms/power plants. New technologies and increase in solar panel efficiency will reduce that demand even more. 

""My point was that it's insignificant in the context of the bigger picture""

Yes, but I wasn't saying that solar panels on roofs should be replacing all energy production in grand scheme of things. In bigger picture solar farms themselves probably generate a very small amount of energy for the UK.

""You can put solar panels on all the public buildings you want, a serious commitment in terms of money and land area needs to be made to make the switch to renewable energy.""

Yes I agree to the latter part to a certain extent. As a island we have plenty of coast line where we can harvest wind and tidal energy. Tidal can be based under the waterline so wouldn't be an ""eye sore"" as is often used as a compliant against renewables. But the solar panels on public buildings would be more actually symbolic that government is serious about the environment, than a major source or energy for the country. Also it circles back to those buildings would be drawing less energy from grid and points I made earlier.

""We need a balance, yes. But to do so with an emphasis on renewable energy requires a serious industrialisation of the countryside, and a few token solar panels on roofs will do very little to address the problem.""

Yes we need a serious emphasis and mix. But solar panels on as many roofs as possibly would lighten the load on any industrialisation.  After all there is 25 million households. That awful lot of roofs even if only 25% were viable for instillation of solar panels.

Can't see him EVER going for under £10-15m no matter how he performs at Liverpool.

I said in a thread in /r/soccer and have been thinking about it since that he works best with a long passing Pirlo like defensive midfielder spraying balls to him to run on to.  With the pace in Liverpool's attack, perhaps the hope is that they can exploit the trendy high line with pushing up fullbacks that everybody is playing now and take advantage of Gerrard's still sharp passing ability to release Balo into more countering situations than he is currently doing?

I tend to think that the current problem is that Balo is that he's a misshapen Plan A at the moment when he could potentially be a wonderfully packaged Plan B.

A lot of people who express concern for the environment are against nuclear power, for example, but very few other forms of generation can deliver power on the scale of a gigawatt per square kilometer. A wind farm delivers around a megawatt per square kilometer, a factor of 1000 smaller than a nuclear power station. For every large power station you build, you need to cover a land area the size of the West Midlands to provide equivalent generating capacity. (Typical Bavarian solar farms are only a factor of two better, meaning every km^2 of large power station instead requires 500km^2 of solar array).

It doesn't matter what you're mixing your wind and solar with; you need to cover a lot of land with renewable generation hardware if you want it to make a serious contribution. Otherwise we end up with the current situation where all of the generation is provided by large power stations (gas, coal, nuclear) and a few token renewable schemes pushed by the government to buy the votes of environmentally-concerned voters and lobbyists. 

Absolutely, we need a wider energy mix, but token wind farms and solar panels on roofs will not put us in a position where we can phase out large power stations, and we absolutely will need to ""ruin the landscape"" (in the words of /u/Pseudolus_Festivus) if we want renewables to be anything other than a symbolic part of that energy mix.

**Product claims:** ""a perfect blend of multi-vitamins and skin-loving ingredients to keep your skin clarified and refreshed. 100% alcohol free, perfect even for sensitive skin.""

**About you:** Generally dry skin that isn't prone to breakouts, but is prone to dehydration and PIH.

**Your opinion:** I've only used this product for a week but it is everything I wanted niacinamide to do. I've had horrible patches of dry skin on my face and this has helped to soothe them. PIH has faded faster, reduces any redness if I've been a bit rough with the cleanser and preps my skin for the rest of my routine.

Now UKIP is taking support from the Torys - normally the opposition party would be the Ives to benefit but Labour are being so very useless and badly organised that they are not picking up the support they should and are losing people to UKIP too. 

Now both parties feel they need to react to UKIP and Europe seems to be the issue that will sway people and cut off the flow to UKIP. Problem for them is that Europe isn't actually what people are worried about but the politicians set the agenda and decide what to talk about do now that's top of the agenda. 

That's how I see it - a natural swing in support, a weak opposition and an overreaction by the government has set this off.

You can get an idea of the motivation behind voting for UKIP by looking at the social opinions that commonly unite their voters across rich and poor:

**Higher Income voters UKIP and the Conservatives are competing for.**

&gt; These groups are once again overwhelmingly old and white and relatively happy with their standard of living. However they also exhibit some strong personal traits. For example many of these voters believe strongly that 'little can be done to change life'. Clearly a fairly disillusioned group. In addition they also believe strongly that it it is 'important to do your duty'. L52s and L54s also believe very strongly that 'a woman's place is in the home' and that 'real men don't cry'. They also overwhelmingly read one of either The Daily Express or Daily Mail. When asked if cannabis should be legalised they respond with a very firm NO! Seats like Norfolk North, Louth &amp; Horncastle, Totnes, St Ives, Norfolk North West, North Cornwall and Dorest West have very high proportions of these voter groups. 

**Lower Income voters UKIP and Labour are competing for.**

&gt; Many of these voters are struggling to cope financially. They should be ideal territory for Labour, and in many respects they are. As the chart for Labour support shows Labour does win the support of many of these voters. However UKIP have scored notable success amongst these groups in this years local elections, and also in by-elections across the country since 2010. Seats like Rotherham, Doncaster North, Nottingham North, Easington, Rhondda, Blaenau Gwent, Sheffield Brightside and Hills, and Washington &amp; Sunderland West have very high proportions of these groups.

&gt; Perhaps surprisingly given that many of them support Labour many of these households exhibit some of the same beliefs around a woman's place being in the home (M56, M57, M59, O67). Many of them also believe strongly that contraception is a woman's responsibility (M56, M57, M59, N61, O67). As with the other older households in Clacton these groups also state very strongly that 'real men don't cry', and that it is 'important to do your duty'.

There aren't actually that many unskilled labourers in the UK who'd be willing to do these jobs. We need immigration for both menial jobs as well as specialised jobs, because without them, we would be deficient in both. 

Additionally, we shouldn't be focusing so much on employment. The natural unemployment rate of the UK seems to be somewhere between 500,000 and 1 million. And that's just counting the unemployed who are actively seeking work. there's millions more dependents who are low skilled and dependent on spouses' or relatives' incomes. There aren't enough jobs out there for everyone to have one all of the time. Even during boom times there will be a high unemployment rate and there will be more recessions in future to put the unemployment rate back into the millions. 

So we can't not have low-skilled immigration for menial tasks, because that puts ridiculous price hikes on consumers and business owners due to the lack of labour (and therefor ability of labourers to demand more pay). We also can't have full employment, because it just never happens, whether there's immigration or not. It just doesn't happen. So we should allow people to have a decent quality of life whether they are employed or not. This could be either through a process of negative taxation, or an unconditional basic income.

This needs to be fixed. Quite simply.

I'm all for preserving any and all life but if someone has really had enough then that is their decision. It doesn't matter who or how many wish a person in such circumstances to survive (read: doctors), if they are of comparatively sound mind and are satisfied with the years under their belt, it is exclusively their decision. Sadly, i've come to the conclusion that such a leap is a long way from being actioned or accepted in the right circles to make a difference.

My grandma i'm sure also did something along these lines. I was too young and naive to recognise the signs but having recently (on the order of less than a year if memory serves) lost her husband, i'm sure she had resigned herself from life.

false,RedditMcRedditor,nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"I think a part of this problem is judging all nurses on the average of the country as a whole. 

£22k a year may not sound like much down south, but that's a pretty good wage in many other parts of the country.

While I'm all for giving nurses a living wage, I don't think that should mean massively overpaying people outside of London because all nurses want the same rates of pay, regardless of pay rates in the area.

And this is why a lot of people think nurses get a good wage as it is.

The living wage in London is far higher than the majority of the rest of the country. We shouldn't be setting a universal wage based on that high, but rather giving people a living wage based on the area. 

The problem with this is that people then get pissy because people doing the same job as them are getting more money. And then other people start arguing over where the borders meet for the differences in pay rates. And then everyone starts arguing because the next town over gets more because of some arbitrary line.

_____________________
**Trev-*nyad*-aith**
______________________

The Welsh letter ""f"" = the English letter ""v"", so the syllable ""tref"" is pronounced ""trev"".

The dipthong ""ae"" in the final syllable is pronounced similar to the English word ""**eye**"" and *not* like the ""ay"" in ""b**ay**"". I've rendered that sound as ""ai"" in this explanation - you'll see it pop up again later on.

________________

***Sale*-waith**
_________________

The first syllable is pronounced the same as the English words ""sail"" and ""sale"".

The dipthong ""ai"" in the second syllable is, again, pronounced the same as the English ""eye"".

__________________

**Am-*dhif*-in**

__________________

Short ""a"" in the first syllable - as in ""b**a**n"", not ""b**ar**n"".

The digraph ""dd"" represents a single sound in Welsh - a voiced ""th"" (""voiced"" meaning that the voicebox must vibrate to produce the sound). It's the ""th"" sound in ""the"" or ""then"" - not the unvoiced ""th"" of ""thing"" or ""thimble"". The double F later on is also a digraph, and represents the sound of the English letter F. Therefore ""ddiff"" is pronounced ""dhif"".

Short ""i"" in the final syllable - as in ""p**i**n""

__________________

**Man**
_________________

Man, as in ""**man** this is *hard*"".

_____________________
**Huff-*ordh*-ee**
_____________________
The Welsh letter Y changes in pronounciation depending on its location within a word. Here, it sounds like the English letter U. So Hyff = huff.

Another voiced ""th"" in the next syllable, preceded by a short ""o"" - as in ""**or**ange"", not ""d**oor**"".

Long ""i"" in the final syllable, as in ""k**ee**n"".
_______________________________
***Kair*-went**
_______________________________
The ""ae"" of ""Caer"" sounds like the English word ""eye"", again.
""Went"" sounds like ""lent"" but with a W in place of an L.

Oh, and every letter R should be pronounced and be [trilled](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Alveolar_trill.ogg) / tapped if possible.

**Price of product:** £24.60 for 45g

**Where did you purchase:** Boots Acne Clinic

**Product claims:** *Adapalene stops the formation of blackheads or whiteheads. It also reduces the inflammation that occurs with acne.*

**About you:** Dry skin type, prone to dehydration and PIH

**Your opinion:** Honestly, I started using this product for preventative anti-aging and fading of my PIH rather than any acne. 

My skin is pretty much where I want it to be, but I can't attribute it to Differin alone. In particular it has helped with unclogging stubborn closed comodones and fading new PIH quickly (I only have to look at my my skin and I get PIH..) If I have got one of those sore under the skin cysts coming up, layering Differin and Benzoyl peroxide overnight eliminates it too (makeshift EpiDuo?) 

I haven't found it drying at all. I bought some [Isotrex gel](http://www.doctorfox.co.uk/acne-treatment/#prices) recently (isotretinoin 0.05%) which I'll try when my Differin runs out. I'm a bit wary because it's obviously stronger and in an alcohol base gel  :/

You could still cross over the border when there wasn't a common visa. Disease screening and policy will have already been discussed in creating the common visa. These ""liasons"" have already occurred as a matter of course in those negotiations. Surely having a common visa with the ""other jurisdiction"" negates the risk.

There were a couple of questionable calls (our pen included), but we never really looked like scoring more than one goal other than Soldado's volley, whereas City tore through our midfield and backline time and time again.  We could've very easily conceded six again.

I was pretty disappointed with Poch's approach.  A commentator on the sidelines said initially we didn't set up pressing so high, but once we scored in the first half, Poch obviously sensed blood and thought we could go for the jugular.  For the rest of the match, he kept imploring the team to press higher and higher, and the fullbacks to get as high and wide as possible.

This was a mistake for me.  Poch must've figured there was another goal or two we could nick, but in chasing that, he left us wide open to get punished.  And we did.

There's nothing wrong with going to the home of the champions, sitting back and trying to hit on the counter.  We did it really well against Arsenal, and granted, City is a much better side than them, but is it any wonder that sitting deep for a change brought out Kaboul's best game in ages, whereas any time we've pressed high, he's looked vulnerable?  You've got to play to your strengths, and at the moment, our strength is not a high back line.

Had the last 12 months not been an abject horrorshow against top six opposition, I'd say fine, go for it.  But our team has been dealt enough indignities over the last year or so to deserve some protection against one of the two best sides in the country.

false,ZombieWomble,null,null,"&gt; Actually there is loads of choice in unionism, that's the problem with first past the post elections, if there is more diversity in one end of the spectrum there is a risk of an unrepresentative candidate being elected.

Isn't this a false narrative around Westminster elections? The unionist vote is not split in any substantive way in the marginal constituencies where they're discussing pacts. Belfast North as an example, given it's the seat the UUP are offering up.

From a quick look at Wikipedia, since 1990 there has never been more than two main 'unionist' parties in the Westminster constituency (UUP &amp; Conservatives, later UUP &amp; DUP), along with the two main nationalist parties and, on some years, a few 'others' (Alliance, Green, Workers party, Rainbow Dream Ticket etc). So the amount of diversity  is pretty much identical on both ends of the spectrum. 

Indeed, the degree of splitting in the vote is actually greater on the nationalist side than on the unionist side (here roughly defined as the ratio of lead unionist or nationalist party's vote to all votes on that side).

Running a unionist unity candidate in Belfast North would be an attempt to *create* an unrepresentative situation, not prevent one. The situation is even worse in FST, the seat the UUP want in exchange, where they're trying to paper over an ~8% defecit between unionism and nationalism.

I should note that I'm not actually saying they *shouldn't* do this - they're a unionist party, maximizing the unionist representation is basically their job - but that implying it's trying to rectify an otherwise unfair situation is deeply misleading.",0,1413752613,null,0,false,0,cle0fbw,t3_2jns7d,t1_cle0fbw,t1_cldp2ox,null,1426449700,3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3

So yeah, I think Borini - at least while Sturridge is out - is worth a punt due to the movement that he offers, Balo would thrive with someone to play off.

 Is it detached?

I'm spec'ing up a self build renovation and extension of an old house at the moment, it's pretty much derelict, nothing but four walls and a bit of roof but I'd like to keep as much of it as I can.  It was built by my great-grandfather in the 30's and I'm into maintaining the embodied energy as much as preserving the architectural heritage of the village.  It has solid walls and I'm probably going to opt for external insulation on it, that way I can preserve internal space and use the walls as a heat sink for passive heating.

The house I'm in just now is a semi-detached cottage so it all has to be internal here.  I gained a couple of square meters of floor from bringing down the chimney stack but lost 100mm all round with the insulation, plasterboard and skirtings.

Make sure you deal with any existing damp issues before you get into it.  I had to take down the chimney breast because it was funneling damp up from the founds.  It went 6 feet under the floor so I needed to replace solum and complete the damp course before laying the floor insulation.

Firstly, on the football side... I don't think his link play is good. It's pretty good when things are going well - when it's breaking to him between midfield and defence and he has time on the ball and can pick a pass. He did that well at times yesterday when City didn't get tight enough to him, and he hurt them with his passing (Mason chance, Eriksen goal). But when our backs are to the wall and we need an out ball - we need someone to put his back to a defender, hold them off, and keep the ball - then he struggles IMO. He fails to show for the ball (to create an angle to receive it), he is outmuscled too easily, he loses his temper, and his movement/energy levels/nuisance factor are not there.

And I don't think Adebayor is the perfect player by any stretch, but he is a handful for defenders - he's not easy to play against partly because he's quite unpredictable (both intentionally and unintentionally).

The other thing for me is this off-pitch persona. Adebayor is a mercenary who only cares about himself. Whereas Soldado loves Spurs. How do we know this? Social media. Their PR. We have, of course, absolutely no idea if this is correct. In fact, we know it's likely *not* correct in Adebayor's case since we know he does a *lot* of amazing charitable work. But many fans go along with what they're fed by the media and by fans who want to run him down.

This week I'd play Soldado with Lamela behind him in the Europa League, see what happens, and go from there.

false,crucible,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; The issue is, if you need more capacity you don't need to build a high speed line, you build a high capacity line.

You can have both though. France uses mostly [double-decker high-speed trains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNCF_TGV_Duplex) on the core TGV network now.

They've even converted four of them into a new low cost subsidiary called [Ouigo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouigo). It's copying the Easyjet approach and bringing it to railways:

* [brightly coloured trains](https://www.flickr.com/photos/125099625@N02/14562746812/)

* Less onboard staff.

* No buffet car - the fixtures were removed and most of it was converted for luggage storage.

* 100 extra seats were installed per train. They now have 600 seats as opposed to just over 500.

* Trains are used more intensively than regular TGVs. Up to 13 hours a day with quick turnaround at stations.

They [sold a million tickets](http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/high-speed/first-1-million-ouigo-tickets-sold.html) for the Paris - Marseille route within 6 months of launching the service.

They do have extra charges above the low fares though. As per Wikipedia:

&gt;Supplementary fees are as follows:

&gt; Children that are 11 or under, a flat fee of €5 is charged no matter the journey.

&gt; Baggage (per piece) is €5 if booked at the time of booking, €10 prior to travelling on-line, or €40 if purchased at the station immediately prior to travel.

&gt; Pets can be taken on board, however provided that they are under six kilos and they are in the carry case as part of the hand luggage they travel free. If not, they are charged a fee of €40 per animal, or €30 if they are booked at the same time as owner.

&gt; Seats next to plug sockets can be reserved for a supplementary fee of €2 per person.",0,1413756537,null,0,false,0,cle2f75,t3_2jpmi1,t1_cle2f75,t1_cldzish,null,1426448769,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17

false,strolls,null,null,"My understanding is that the traditional way (until Major?) of funding big projects was that the government borrowed the money from the international markets or the Bank of England, used it to pay for the projects, and then made repayments at about the base rate of interest.

Such debts showed on the national debt as government borrowing, so in order to avoid this (and look like they were spending less) Blair &amp; Brown started getting hospital trusts to arrange their own financing.

This means that banks and corporate financiers now borrow the money from the BoE at the base rate and then lend it on to the hospital trusts, over 25 years, at a profit.

The cost of building the hospital no longer shows on the balance sheet as ""Labour government gets Britain further into debt"", but repayments become an ongoing operating cost of the hospital, hence passing the cost of building new hospitals on to future generations and future governments.

This practice (called ""Private Partnership Investment"" or ""PPI"") has continued under the current conservative government.

I watched every game, and knew that I was lucky to experience that particular season, but that my first impression of real football was being skewed heavily. I'd watch the games with breakfast, and was always happy to go down 1 goal because it meant we were going to score at least 2 goals before the end of the game.

I'd have been happy to watch when Luis wasn't scoring and Downing would set Stevie up by bouncing the ball off of the goal. I'd be fine with a 3-2 against the team at the bottom of the table where we only score one goal if that one goal was scored by our Andy Carroll, but this just hurts to watch. I kind of wish I'd gotten to experience the manly ""my team is a shambles this season"" and it's ruined my morning and now I need a beer cliche earlier in my sports fan who watches sports life.

    ------------Allen----Gerrard-------------
    ---Sterling-----Coutinho----Lallana------
    ----------------Henderson----------------

I think Hendo could make a decent false 9, he does plenty of running and is strong and good in the air. Real Madrid are really unbalanced, they haven't a good deep lying destroyer since Alonso left, so I think that if Henderson played between the lines he could find a lot of space there and then do sexy cheeky backheels to the players running on, Lallana and Sterling. Think it would give us a very dynamic forward line and we could have the front 3 rotate fluidly in possession. Coutinho would have 3 dynamic runners to thread balls through to, Gerrard gets his babysitter in central midfield and also Allen is there to link up defence and attack and circulate the short passes which is something that Gerrard has not been excellent at doing in his single pivot role. 

I think this team would also be excellent for playing on the counter.

Once diagnosed, it is about six months to passing, give or take.

He was in a great deal of pain and was acutely aware of his fate.

When asked if there was anything that the McMillan nurse could do for him he told her to help him die.

She got rather stiff and bristley at him.

Instead we got unnecessary hospital treatments - some which caused him further pain and causing my partner to have to have time off of work pressuring her employment.

We had to fight to get him into hospital and were advised by a Keech nurse to call an ambulance for him and simply refuse to have him back.

Instead of a dignified and managed exit, (the man was a scientist, an industrial metallurgical chemist) we got to watch him slowly lose his faculties through the use of a morphine driver, initially to manage the pain but increased to hasten his end.

Eventually he was moved to a hospice once he'd gone far enough for them to be certain he wouldn't occupy a bed there for very long.

I had always believed one should have a right to die, this confirmed beyond all doubt.
