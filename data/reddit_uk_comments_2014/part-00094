Yes he needs to earn his place in a team like Liverpool but by the sounds of things here and in previous interviews he didn't get much of an explanation as to what was needed or expected to do. He did play well at times and was then dropped unfairly you could argue. He's cast off to Stoke and no one seems to be communicating with him.

The independent shop argument is popular, but not unconvincing.

Since supermarkets are obviously better than equivalent independent shops, the supermarket will win. But other shops might benefit from the extra people in the area.

The war memorial argument is pretty weak. The first world war was 100 years ago. There is a point where we can stop remembering it, just as we no longer commemorate the English civil war, or the Plague. If I died in a war, I'd hate to think that my memory was being used to oppose progress.

You'd lose some sovereignty, yes. Why that is such a big deal for any reason other than patriotism and nationalism is beyond me.

&gt;and our ability to fend for ourselves

If you mean to fend for yourselves literally, then the English Channel has done more to defend Britain than anything else in its history. If you meant it in a more figurative sense, then the days when Britain could punch well above its own weight are well in the past.

&gt;The deaths of the men in the two world wars would be for nothing

The EU is a direct product of the desire of European nations to make sure that they wouldn't go to war again. Failure to recognize this is a disservice to history.

&gt;Britain would be enslaved by the world banking scene

Are you implying that Britain isn't already host to the world's largest financial center?

Has the rest of the EU has got it wrong? What is it that British Eurosceptics know that no one else knows? Why is Euroscepticism so much more prevalent if not for a different, arguably more widespread, nationalism?

&gt;The National Insurance Funds are used to pay for certain types of welfare expenditure and National Insurance payments cannot be used directly to fund general government spending. However, any surplus in the funds is invested in government securities, and so is effectively lent to the government at low rates of interest. National Insurance contributions are paid into the various National Insurance Funds after deduction of monies specifically allocated to the National Health Services (NHS).

I got it running like this:

    add-apt-repository ppa:unit3/bfgminer
    apt-get update
    apt-get install bfgminer
    bfgminer -S antminer:all -o stratum+tcp://stratum.mining.eligius.st:3334 -O my1bitcoin1address --set-device antminer:clock=x0781

I have it running on a PC I use as a home NAS server / playing-with-Linux box. The system is designed to do lots of useful stuff while being always on and using not too much electricity. I use a Nofan CS 70 case and the Nofan fanless PSU. It's a weird case design but the Antminer fits nicely under the top grille.

There's an intel i7 3770T (the T means low power; basically I wanted to limit the max power drawn by the CPU so things wouldn't get too hot even with some runaway process using all the CPU). There's an SSD and the hard disks are usually spun down so it's completely silent. ASUS P8B75M motherboard, fwiw.

Anyway, all that, disks spun down, CPU idle (well, running bitcoin-qt full node at 1-2% CPU) is using 32.8W at the wall, according to my power meter from B&amp;Q.

Plug in the Antminer, red light goes on, immediately I am using 33.2W.

Run bfgminer (which seems to use 0% CPU) and it jumps to 35W.

So that's 2.2W extra power at the wall, which seems better than advertised.

I seem to be getting around 2 GH/s, though I'm not sure how to interpret the bfgminer output yet. Work is being accepted.

Little green light blinks irregularly every couple of seconds. Don't know what it means but it must be good.

The thing feels quite hot. I just plugged it straight in (no extra cooling; PC is meant to be silent). Measured 62C with a thermocouple pressed against the heat sink.

true,octarion,null,null,"Don't be judgemental - that 'homeless looking scary loud shouty man' was offering to do you a favour. He probably doesn't *want* to know that you have a bus pass.

Think of it this way - you're homeless, you don't have much cash. If you're lucky enough to still have a car, you probably live in it and any chance you get to fill it up will be from a dodgy character with a jerry can at bugger o'clock in some car park, if you're lucky enough to ever need to visit (or have the time to visit) any place deserving of a car park. 

So, you have very limited freedom of movement - not enough money for the train or a car, you totally rely on buses. Of course, you don't have enough money for a pass or even for any regular bus travel - the only way you have to get around is to beg, scrounge or (if you can find it) work yourself enough cash to be able to justify a few quid on a bus. That takes a lot of effort. Of course, you need some place to go, too - some goal, usually somewhere to sleep, beg or find work.

A day ticket is a pretty valuable thing. You found one, giving you free travel via buses for a whole day! Awesome! Now you've done all the travel you have the energy for or have a need to do for the whole day and have found the best place to set down for the remainder. 

You also have a valuable opportunity to do 3 things:

1. Have a relatively 'normal' interaction with a relatively 'normal' person
2. Do somebody a favour by giving away something *you* own
3. Maybe even help somebody else out who is in your situation

If you were homeless, wouldn't you savour the opportunity to actually do all these things? When else would you have a chance to help somebody out like that when the majority of them are much more fortunate than you are? 

Binning it is silly - you're disposing of something that is actually very useful and could really help somebody. It's like wasting a meal - anybody who has been through any real hardship will never want to do that because they know that even the *chance* it could help somebody else out is worth the small 'social deficit' of approaching a stranger to offer it to them. The shoutyness and loudness are probably due to some combination of hard hearing, impatience to settle down somewhere, salty attitude borne from time on the streets, anger at the rejection of the gift offered, anger at the unfairness of life that put them into this position, the fact that you can't appreciate the value of the gesture and finally, the annoyance of having to waste time repeating this process until somebody takes it or they get too impatient to continue and piss themselves off even more by wasting it.

You can't live very long as a homeless person if you aren't willing to approach strangers when it's required for your continued survival, but it doesn't make it any easier. Next guy that you see that offers you a bus pass, just take it, smile and say thanks. Give it to somebody waiting at the stop you get off at or pass on £2.50 to the next homeless guy you see. Sure, Romani beggars will give it to their boss and some junkies would just put it towards their next bag but that doesn't really matter when it could also mean a good meal or a chance at work for somebody. 

This post is totally unrelated to anything in the original topic and is also really, really long, but there you go - I think you touched a nerve.

And a footnote - I spent quite a lot of time with homeless people and various related street misfits when I was younger. Don't get me wrong - a lot of them are mentally ill, some of them are dangerous or even outright malevolent. Some of them will screw you over without a second thought, especially if you're a shy or weak person, because that's just how it is - others will see your naivety or weakness and try to cultivate it like a green sapling in the Sahara desert, relishing the opportunity to engage in some kind of relative 'normalcy' in comparison to their day-to-day lives as social outcasts. That doesn't, however, mean that they aren't people. I wouldn't suggest hanging around with potentially dangerous homeless people regularly or getting into deep conversations with them unless you're willing and able to take on the stigma and dangers that go with that but that doesn't mean you should dismiss them out-of-hand or ignore them either - just treat them like anybody else you'd meet, mind your manners and don't look down on them or make light of them or their troubles.

As for transfers in, I guess it just comes down to how good the youth we bring through are. I'm not opposed to bringing them through, far from it, but I wouldn't want it to be done too fast at the cost of club progression. I also don't know if we'd have a striker capable of keeping up top form from the youth straight away, and that is one thing we've really needed, so I'd like a striker in to replace Osvaldo, who I would rather we didn't even entertain the idea of taking back.

2. It really depends on what the discussion is, and what football culture you're talking about. All because you play for amateur football club doesn't really mean you know more than anyone. I can only really seeing it coming into play when it's an incident like diving, because arguably an experienced player has a sense of reality about it. Aswell as when fans of other sports call footballer soft for falling over the time. It's hard for them to understand that when running full sprint while keeping a ball at your feet, it's not hard to fall over.

Just came here to say that I know /u/therealhuthaifa personally, and he is in fact a phony. He has stated countless times to me that he “isn’t a Chelsea fan”, just a “Torres fan” and that if Torres was ever sold to another club, he would be a fan of that club and completely ditch Chelsea. 
You see, the truth is, he just started following soccer around the time of the last world cup, when Torres was injured, right before he was sold to Chelsea. He picked up a controller one day to fill in for a friend who was playing FIFA against another friend of mine, and the team so happened to be Spain. He barely knew how to play, but somehow, every time Torres touched the ball, he would take a shot and score miraculously. Mind you this was FIFA 10, when Torres was actually rigged in the game, and rightfully so. From that day on, he started watching YouTube videos of Torres, and started developing a man crush towards this “God of Soccer”, as he would refer to him. When Torres was sold to Chelsea, this guy quickly jumped on their bandwagon, and came up with millions of excuses as to why Torres was playing like shit. I’ve seen more “He’s back” statuses on his Facebook than on /r/soccer. Now as you can see, I do not have a problem with someone having a favorite player, or following a team just because they love that player, I do it too (I’m a United fan, but I follow Dortmund too because I love Reus, Lewa, Hummels, and Gotze (yes I still like him now)). The problem I have is when that person acts ignorant about the fact that their player is absolute shit, and constantly claims things like “Torres is the best striker in the world” or “Torres is better than Ibrahimovic” or “Spain needs Torres to win the world cup in Brazil”. Grow up and face the fact that this player will never be as good as he was or even as good as you describe him. You can’t ignore the shit performance he had today either.  
I know he knows who this is and I know he will call and curse me out for telling people the truth, but you seem like good people and you deserve to know what a fake scumbag he is. And /u/therealhuthaifa I was just want to tell you, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart: You cunt.

Having a player of Alonso quality is rare in modern football.

true,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,"&gt;Why? That's some kind of coalescent for marriage. It suggests that one should just acquiesce and not contemplate the possibility of alternatives.


Contemplate away, but don't mistake contemplation for reality. Also the ""for better or worse"" may have originated with traditional Christian marriage vows, but frankly I consider it appropriate since the Monarch is meant to be appointed by God...and who are you to argue with God?

Ignoring that, if your only counterpoint to all that was to question my wording then honestly you might as well just wave a flag that says ""I cannot argue this point and am trying to distract you""

&gt;Unproven. Disproven, in fact... 

Do you have a source? My reading into the Monarchy finances seems to indicate that the Queen and very few others were privy to something vaguely suggestive of a wage although not quite because wages are taxed. This, according to my reading, ended in 2012. The rest are on the Civil List...which also ended in 2012. 

In fact, looking at the Soverign Grants Act of 2011, it seems like the money the Soverign (IE: The motherfucking Queen) gets is directly linked to the revenue she generates...which kind of throws a spanner in your argument since nobody in the royal family is out on the street yet when according to you the idea that they generate a net profit is disproven.

&gt;hahaha the irony...

Irony indeed...that serves a purpose.

&gt;Diddums. The poor things. I suppose that's also justification for hardworking citizens to support their lifestyles? So dissolve the institution and let them get jobs and pay tax like everybody else...

Do you realise what it's like to be under national...no...international scrutiny 24/7? There's a reason that we don't see much of Elizabeth's husband, you know. In fact there's a reason why we don't see much of Camilla. The only reason we see so much of Charles is because he keeps insisting on putting himself in the limelight. You could equate the lifestyles of the monarchy to that of celebrities, I suppose. Being famous for some birth-given talent or ability or just...nothing at all. Being given extortionate amounts of money for this ability or lack thereof...except unlike the monarchy, celebrities can choose to stop their careers. Monarchs? Notsomuch.

&gt;The power of veto isn't an overwhelming concern to me. My concern is that we as a people cannot decide who has that power. 

Your apathy isn't an overwhelming concern to me. Answer the point or concede it.

&gt;I never used the word.

No, I did.

&gt;Republicanism isn't about hating the royals. It's not about them, it's about us - empowering the people, to choose who represents us, on the basis of what values. 

And pray tell, how does the Monarchy represent you more than, say, the Prime Minister? How does the Monarchy play a role in your government greater than, say, Home Secretary? Education Secretary? Defence Secretary? 

Short version: It doesn't. You've watched too much Johnny English and Blackadder. The Monarchy does not partake in Parliament save for a couple of largely symbolic acts such as asking the winner of an election to form a government. We kind of had a civil war over this. A fair while ago...did...did you not get the news?

true,ninjasimon,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"No one else has mentioned it, so I'd like to point out that e-cigarettes share one chemical in common with cigarettes and that's nicotine. We are aware of what chemicals are in e-liquid, the market is somewhat regulated and many people prepare their own; Vegetable Glycerine, Propylene-Glycol, and food grade flavourings.

Nicotine is addictive and poisonous, but it is not the most dangerous chemical in tobacco smoke. Nicotine is not cancerous, which means it does not cause the growth of new tumours, though I have heard it can accelerate their growth. The vast majority of the nicotine in e-cigarette vapour is absorbed in the lungs (e-cigs would be fairly useless if this were not the case). Cancerous chemicals like those with benzene rings are not present in e-cigarettes, nor are they present in their vapour. 

I can understand your desire for caution after we got it so wrong with cigarettes, but our understanding of science has come a long way, e-liquid manufacturers are a lot more open as to what their products contain and studies have been/are being conducted into the health effects.

Banning or unnecessarily restricting the sale of an addictive substance that is so much safer than the alternative is not just illogical, it's dangerous.

He plays the pauper (in comparison to City) to make it seem like his team should not be expected to do well. 

I think both of the above facts are well known. As also the fact that Rodgers has gotten the most from his squad with a few strategic additions and also it should be noted, a few strategic sales. 

I think it also states the very obvious fact that Liverpool seem to be the team with the most 'financial morality' among the current top 3 teams.

That said there were very strong and persistent rumours about both of them. Obviously that talk has died down due to pushing for the title. I don't think it's any coincidence that we've settled on a back four that the ship has steadied. If we don't win and a reasonable offer comes in for either of them it's not immpossible they're gone whether Rodgers likes it or not.

Willian's work in the transition from defense to attack is unheralded imo.  His first step is so good and he's tremendous at maintaining possession in tight spots.  If he had a striker to work off of with a bit of space around the box he would be scoring far more.

true,C0TT3NM0UTH,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"I am aware of what the situation on the ground was before we invaded. They still have extremists going around blowing up civilians, that has not changed.

The reason for the invasion was that the Taliban refused to extradite Osama bin Laden without being provided evidence of his involvement in terrorism, they asked him to leave the country, but because of their refusal to hand him over to the US without evidence, the US ended all negotiations and began Operation Enduring Freedom. The invasion had absolutely nothing to do with us helping people out.

The definition of crimes against peace is ""planning, preparation, initiation, or waging of wars of aggression..."", we (the UK and USA) were not attacked by the Taliban, or Afghan national forces, we initiated a war, to find a single (Saudi Arabian) individual, who was accused (AFAIK not convicted) of terrorism charges, in the US.

The 'stopping the bully' narrative has essentially been invented during the occupation to attempt to avoid any fallout for those involved in the invasion and occupation. There is a brilliant documentary made by VICE named 'This is what winning looks like', available on their channel on YouTube, watch that, then tell me if you think they (the afghan people who have endured years of conflict) are better off .",0,1396495921,null,0,false,0,cgirpc4,t3_21wn22,t1_cgirpc4,t1_cghua0c,null,1433187126,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Honestly not that concerned. Andy's movement off the ball is almost non-existent and I think our defensive line will know how to tackle him, literally. Maybe Rodgers will insert Sakho at some point in the game, though I can't see him starting because of his lack of playing time. 

I'm really more concerned about players not picking up any injuries, us maintaining or growing our goal difference, and Gerrard not picking up any Yellow cards.

And then they went back in time and created human civilization, eventually creating the Apollo program because they desperately needed a space suit, and this was more efficient than filling in the paperwork to requisition one from storage.

People don't understand just how complicated the paperwork gets when you break away from the parent church.

Either that, or the reality is that we haven't been given enough information yet, and in an upcoming season we're going to find out the connection between ""scary guys"", ""priests"", and ""guys who directed humans to go to the moon just because they needed a space suit"".

You can't say that one group is ""really"" called this or that, because there's a very large group that was showing up *everywhere* and entire species were fleeing their planets to escape (see Vampires of Venice for an example).

With that said, I find his lack of offensive traits as you mentioned another primary cause for our  lack of a strong offense against teams that park the bus. When Hazard gets marked or double-teamed we have noone to provide a creative assist or to score a goal. Especially with little room against busparking teams we just end up losing the battle in midfield and not doing much offensively against those teams (that chart about the 2014 dropped points shows proof of this. 1 goal in those 5 games..)

true,anitapizquik,null,null,"UK pupils score highly in problem solving


UK teenagers perform significantly better than most of their international peers in problem-solving activities, according to OECD analysis which highlights the importance of creative logic skills in the global jobs market.

The research, published on Tuesday, was carried out alongside the 2012 Pisa test rankings released in December. These initial results showed 15-year-olds in the UK lagging far behind their Asian competitors in Shanghai, Singapore and Hong Kong, which led the table across the core test areas of maths, science and reading.

However, the latest analysis, based on a comparison of 85,000 pupils in 44 countries, indicates that UK pupils are unexpectedly strong in problem solving, compared with students in other countries with similar academic abilities. England ranks 11th in the overall table, above France, Germany, the Netherlands and the US but below top problem solvers in Singapore, Korea and Japan.

During the course of the tests, students were confronted with “real-life problems”, such as buying tickets at an unfamiliar vending machine while abiding by constraints set by examiners.

The report authors noted that UK pupils, and particularly those performing well in maths, had “access to learning opportunities that prepare them well for handling complex, real-life problems”. In particular, they outperform their competitors in activities where they must “select, organise and integrate information” in order to understand the problem.

The OECD authors emphasise the growing importance of these skills and discuss the “marked increase in recent decades” in the share of jobs that require creative problem-solving skills.

“Fifteen-year-olds who today lack these skills thus face a high risk of economic disadvantage as adults,” the report reads. “They will compete for jobs that are becoming rare and, if they are unable to adapt to new circumstances and learn in unfamiliar contexts, they may find it particularly difficult to move to better jobs as economic and technological conditions evolve.”

But while the study showed UK girls and boys to have similar levels of problem-solving ability, immigrant students were shown to be performing significantly worse than non-immigrants. Researchers said that this gap – a mean score of 490 in the immigrant group compared with 523 in the non-immigrant group – was far larger than inequalities between the two in maths or reading.

Responding to these findings, the Department for Education drew attention to the link between performing well in maths, reading and science and high aptitude in problem solving.

“This connection between the core subjects and problem solving underlines why we are focusing on the basics in the rigorous new primary curriculum, and why reformed GCSEs and A levels will have open-ended questions which encourage lateral thinking,” a spokesman said.

“We are determined to eradicate poor literacy and numeracy so our young people have a solid grounding in the basics they need to secure a good job, an apprenticeship or a place at university,” the DfE spokesman added.",0,1396511804,null,0,false,0,cgiwd8z,t3_222002,t1_cgiwd8z,t3_222002,null,1433189371,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,doeboy73,null,null,"I can't dispute your first 11, aside from your omission of Banayoun. Who, in his last 2 games, looked the best player on the pitch. 

For the first half of the season BAE was the best left-back in the league, but went well off the boil; quite a surprise and disappointment.
Suk-Young is 24 and so is the type of player we should be moving into the 1st 11 on a permanent basis. He's one of ours not a loan player. Warnock was anti-loan players for a good reason.

For Saturday the back four pick themselves: Suk-Young (LB), Hill (CB), Onuoha (CB), Simpson (RB).

We should see Hoillet (RW), Barton (CM), Morrison (in-the-hole), Henry (CM) and Benayoun (LW) - I think Benayoun's rise in form at QPR is a good example of how it takes players a while to settle into a club. Both I and some others have been guilty of a lack of patience with some of our players.

I don't want to see Zamora start. He's a 2nd-half sub, who can help keep the ball at the other end of the pitch and perhaps assist in creating opportunities for other strikers. With no pace, he shouldn't start a game.

It'll have to be Maiga starting up front. There are rumours Austin will play. We'll see. He should not be played if it means he'll be gone again as a result.

Keeper: Green (of course).

Subs: Zamora, Dunne, Murphy, Kranjkar, Traore, Doyle, Carrol.

Next year I'd like to see a QPR first 11 that includes Austin, Suk-Young, Hitchcock, Philips... we really have an embarrassment of riches in Midfield, that would compliment a mid-table PL team, it's difficult to really choose our best 4 midfield players.

AFAIK that's illegal, and you should be calling the shopkeeper on it.  

We've got two big Tesco stores (one that is absolutely huge), and five or six of the 'corner shop' sized ones.  The nearest small one to me is pretty crap to be honest.  They never have the same deals that the large store does, only seem to carry branded items rather than their own (cheaper) lines - unless it's value thick-sliced bread which goes stale within seconds of opening the bag - and are more expensive than the local Nisa for 90% of the stuff I use the Nisa for (booze, fags, energy drinks, snacks).  I also know that if I'm a quid or two short the bloke in the Nisa will let me drop it off next time I'm in.   

I do use the smaller of the larger stores for about half of my weekly shop - the rest being split between the local market, Iceland and Farmfoods - but I hardly ever use the smaller stores, the exception when I need something after 9pm and before 10pm, the small window when the corner shops are closed and Tesco are still open.
  
**Edited to add:**  I'm not disputing that having a Tesco (or any other supermarket-owned small store) is good for competition.  The corner shops near me *do* decrease in quality and customer service as you get further away from the Tesco, just that for my needs at least the Nisa offers a better experience both personally and financially.",0,1396516960,null,0,1396517533,0,cgix6ak,t3_2238j3,t1_cgix6ak,t3_2238j3,null,1433189752,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;The U.S. does not deny entry to persons with a ""Driving Under the Influence"" (DUI) conviction, although if there are multiple convictions for this and or other misdemeanors, you could be denied entry.

&gt;Generally, any convictions for drug possession can result in denial of entry. If the conviction was long ago, you might contact the U.S. Embassy, Office of Consular Affairs in your country to obtain a waiver. Other misdemeanors may result in denial if they were recent

You also can't use the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) and would have to apply to the embassy for a visa through the full channels.

So whats the problem? Everybody wants stuff to be be cheaper right? 

Well not necessarily. If we lose lots of independent retailers due to big box and small box supermarkets we can lose the essence of a town centre, which has knock on effects to bars, librabries, coffee shops etc etc. as well as the sense of community (extremely hard to put a price on). Saving 10% on the cost of some food can lead (ultimately) to the destruction of small and medium sized town high streets. I'm not sure (as many) that its worth it. 

Add to that the impact that putting most of our food suppliers through supermarkets - they totally screw them on price, which leads to problems with quality, jobs and local production (we have been eating horse meat in part because we are buying shit from eastern europe to eat). 

tl;dr the impact of supermarkets is not only on crappy independent stores - its on decent ones as well as farmers and food suppliers.

&gt;A loaf of bread in a shop is priced at £1.20 but it comes up on the till as £1.50. The shop does not have to sell you the bread at £1.20. You can refuse to buy the bread. The shop might let you buy the bread at the lower price as a goodwill gesture but they don’t have to.

The primary purpose of the US government is to protect the interests of their citizens. The people affected by this policy are not US citizens so if its 'fair' to them is not really a priority.

The wider policy here is ""we don't want to let criminals in"" which seems like a fairly reasonable decision. Now when it comes to applying this policy the easiest way is to say criminal conviction = no entry. Anything else is going to become impossible to administer (eg. individually reviewing each case). This achieves both policy aims criminals can't come in and its not that difficult to make the system work.

Unfortunately this screws over some people but from the USAs point of view they have no shortage of people wanting to come over and there is a route you can appeal it (by going to the embassy) so they can individually review cases if they need to.

If it's really ""everybody in your community"", then maybe they have a good reason for it.

Your rant just reads like an ejaculation of pro-Tesco propaganda and, although you may be right, you're not showing us the other side. 

I shop at Tesco all the time, but they have some really iffy practices when it comes to planning permission and opening new stores.

There used to be a factory that was on the edge of my town when it was opened 50 or 60 years ago, but which is now surrounded by new build houses. When it closed it was demolished and the local council specifically rezoned the land as for further residential development - Tesco bought the site and, with no respect for planning permission, put up signs announcing the arrival of a new store.

You might say ""nothing wrong with putting up a sign"", but Tesco bulldozed the planning process - they knew it would be illegal for them to build a new store there, but they bought the land, anyway, because they knew that they had the resources and stamina to out-wait the council's objections. 

Tesco have massive corporate resources (and, you're right, this is usually to the benefit of consumers) and they have a team who are extremely practiced at the tactics of steamrolling planning applications. Probably have a dozen planning applications at any one time, and team-members who having been working on this stuff for a couple of decades. 

My town has a population of 15,000 and it's local council, on the other hand, are a bunch of oldies. There's simply no comparison - they can make round after round of objections to Tesco's plans, but after a few years Tesco will exhaust them.

I shop at Tesco, I'm glad to have one near me, but I'm glad there are people out there presenting the other side of things. It's their right to protest, and I don't see what your rant adds to the conversation that couldn't have been said by Tesco's corporate communications department.

In the case of something that is already marked, it is the manufacturer who has labelled that price.  Allowing manufacturers to dictate pricing to retailers is silly on its very face, which is probably why it's not illegal to charge a different price.

The example you gave was likely an accidental failure to update the POS records with the new pricing, which is not at all uncommon, because that £1-marked butter probably had the same barcode as it did before the price label was put on.

Even though it's not illegal, larger retailers will almost never try to charge you the higher price.  For independents, that 50p may be a significant loss/saving, but for larger retailers 50p might as well be zero and it wouldn't be worth the bad publicity or loss of business.  That said, you will occasionally run into some jobsworth who just wants to make your life difficult, but I very much doubt he's reflecting store/company policy.

Central midfield HAS to be a priority too. We are horrendously short in this position I think.

Rodwell's injury record speaks for itself though so we would need at least another CM as well. I rate that Ki from Sunderland quite highly as well as Fabian Delph from Villa.

Private medical insurance isn't tax deductible, so this isn't a way of avoiding your obligation to pay for the NHS. 

It does illustrate the sort of problems people will experience if the NHS is allowed to decline further and private medical insurance becomes more necessary.

Where private hospitals do get  a free ride is the use of NHS facilities when a procedure in a  private hospital goes horribly wrong. This is quite common, because NHS hospitals have incomparably better emergency facilities. In my opinion private hospitals should have to pay a  standing charge to the NHS to cover this.

true,KBOT3000,null,null,"&gt; Tesco isn't killing the concept of the corner shop, lazy and incompetent owners are.

Well, it's a bit of both.  Smaller stores just cannot compete on price, they have to buy from wholesalers rather than the producers, and the numbers involved mean that while supermarkets are able to negotiate big discounts, small stores are not.  A lot of small stores do try to avoid commoditisation by adding value in terms of service, or by stocking items which a supermarket doesn't, and this works to an extent.  But small store owners will lose business when a supermarket opens, otherwise the supermarket wouldn't open there in the first place.  They aren't creating new business, they're taking part of an already existent market.  

There are other factors involved as well.  Tesco, for example, are able to spend millions on advertising to entice consumers, small stores are not.  The advertising does have a big impact on where people choose to shop and smaller stores just cannot do this.  

Some national/ multinational companies will run promotions specifically designed to drive small stores out of business.  They may offer things at below cost, or even for free, until they've taken a big enough segment of the market, or gotten rid of the competition entirely.  Small stores do not have the capital to be able to do this.

The big problem that exists amongst our attacking options, is the lack of a left-footed winger. I couldn't understand why we have continued to buy right footed AMs.

Oh, and it's not as though our attacking talent are in the *habit* of creating clear cut chances for each other. We have had games where our attacking band is set to shoot on sight, and *nothing comes of it*. That's desperation in attacking, and exhibits a flaw in the way we go about our possession play. Mourinho seems to think a new striker will help, I'd agree. But, as is often the case, there's more to it than just needing a new striker (progression from DM -&gt; AM in possession is typically fumbly and awkward, Matic has improved this aspect of our play but it is still often meandering and lacking in purpose).",0,1396521153,null,0,false,0,cgixryu,t3_222d0c,t1_cgixryu,t3_222d0c,null,1433190036,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0

He seems a rare breed in the sense that he is so good on the ball but this is not at the expense of being a hard, tough-tackling physical defender. You often get ball-playing centre-backs who struggle with the actual defending part. As you say, his positioning has been a tad suspect at times but considering his age and his lack of premier league experience, this does not worry me in the slightest. I have already seen such a drastic improvement over the 10 or so games he has played to know that this lad has got the potential to be world class. World class is a term thrown around far too often but in John Stones I truly believe he will become one of the best defenders in the world at some point.

No. The reason for alarmism is to maximise newspaper sales today. That's it.

Rubbish. I'm fully aware that the dip in air quality over the last few days is a Bad Thing. I'm aware of the threats of climate change, and of the health risks caused by small particulates.

I'm also aware that attempting to dub this a 'killer smog' for healthy children without underlying breathing problems is a cynical ploy to sell newspapers that has nothing to do with the underlying health risks.

3) He knows Everton and he probably likes Martinez. That's a massive boost in a trasnfer.

4) London rivals with Chelsea make this extremely unlikely.

5) Eto'o iirc is on a 1 year deal so he'll probably be gone. Torres could very well be gone too so that means they need strikers.

&gt;On 3 April 1996, [Liverpool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.) faced [Newcastle United](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.) in a [Premier League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League) fixture at [Anfield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield), during the [1995–96](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995%E2%80%9396_FA_Premier_League) season. Liverpool won the match, scoring four goals to Newcastle's three. The winning goal was scored by striker [Stan Collymore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Collymore) in the second minute of [stoppage time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoppage_time). Before the match, both clubs had lost their previous fixtures but still had a chance of winning the league and wanted to close the gap between themselves and leaders [Manchester United](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.). Newcastle United, who were 12 points ahead in January, had suffered from poor performance throughout March, winning one match out of four that month. Liverpool had won six of their last nine league games during February and March, scored the most goals and conceded the fewest until this match.

1. scholarships. i know you say that these aren't available, but keep looking.  the anecdotal evidence i hear is that there are a lot of scholarships that go woefully underused and will write cheques to anyone who fit their criteria as a result. i can't help with this specifically, but ask/look around, there must be something surely?

2. get a job/more hours. you're starting this placement in 9 months time.  i don't know what commitments you will have between then and now, but there must be some spare time that you can use more productively?  i suspect you won't be able to earn everything you need over one summer, but you can make a dent. you can also look into getting some work once you're in France. 

3. look for corporate sponsors. again, not something i have direct experience with (so i might be making the concept up!), but perhaps there are some companies in your field of expertise who you could approach for funding? in return for getting to know you and perhaps employing a smart person in the future, they might give you a few £ today? i did a year work placement in the middle of my engineering degree, and the employer gave me £1,000 just to complete my final year and apply (not accept) for a role on their grad scheme.

4. go back to the bank.  i am somewhat reluctant to suggest it, because getting into debt is unpopular (not unfairly), especially when you won't be profiting from it any time soon.  however, it might be that your parents could act as guarantors for a loan, or you can get a personal loan that doesn't need explaining. this won't be cheap and i would urge you to be entirely sure what you'd be getting into and how you'd get out, but seeing as you applied for a commercial loan already, i hope that you already know the answers to those questions.

http://www.policymic.com/articles/71255/10-corporations-control-almost-everything-you-buy-this-chart-shows-how

Above is a good page that illustrates what happens when large companies are allowed to grow unchecked.  You're only given the illusion of choice.  This means all kinds of things.  Price fixing, for instance or bullying suppliers to reduce costs (suppliers can't sell to anyone else if you're the only one).  Tesco also have the clout to go further afield to source their supply chain meaning local manufacturers and producers can't necessarily sell to them unless they're willing to cut prices dramatically.  Tesco like to bulk-buy.  What if local firms can’t produce the goods in the quantity that Tesco want them?  They go somewhere else and it can be anywhere because they have the transport and logistics.

Sure, the decline of the high street is not entirely Tesco's (or Asda, Saisbury Morrisions etc) fault.  Online buying, and extortionate high street rents are also to blame.

Your local shops may leave a lot to be desired, but this could just as well be because the rot has already set in.  You said Tesco stores are popping up all over the place where you live.  Local shops can't source decent stuff because they can't afford it because no one’s shopping there anymore.  Producers that could sell to them can't because they've gone bust – Tesco have found a cheaper supplier hundreds of miles away - or Tesco has told them if they want their business and ability to bulk-buy they can't sell to anyone else.

I'm Norwegian and a obviously want him to succeed, but as the media in UK and Norway now point out, he brought in bout 7 players and only two are used and one or two are subs.

Two of the Norwegians are barely used and barely make an improvement. In hindsight it looks like he was  naive about how to turn around a club in an uphill struggle, a situation he has almost never been in, certainly not at this level.

I think that if anything the PSG game showed that he might get back to pre-february Ramires sooner rather than later.I think the main problem with him in PSG is that the two players that limit him the most, his brazilian brothers in Luiz and Willian, were both playing. Paired with Luiz, Ramires has an awkward responsibility of being more offensive, but at the same time he cannot actually do that fully as Luiz tends to do poor tackles and lose ball very easily aswell as not being a strong choice to pass back to (unlike Lampard or Matic). This means he has to be both offensive and defensive at the same time and basically babysit Luiz while the team doesn't gain much from it.

As for Willian, the problem is that Willian's role is almost identical to Ramires' old role, just that he can dribble in trade for some other qualities. Ramires loves to try and use his pace to get through from the right side towards the centre of the box in a diagonal. But as we play now, with Willian and Ivanovic camping there constantly there isn't really a place for him there so he is put more centrally, which is rough for a midfielder that isn't one that loves to shoot. You can see a clear trend in that Ramires' domination has declined in smiliar pattern to Willian's rise to almost guaranteed starter.

Ramires is simply too versatile for his own good (technicality not included in the package sorry!), but at least with Matic/Lampard(to some extent)/Mikel he gets a huge load put off his head and his role is very very clear for positional purposes and general decisionmaking which is what he is absolutely best at and is where he definitively shouldn't be impaired like he is now.",0,1396525340,null,0,false,0,cgiyhtx,t3_223ait,t1_cgiyhtx,t3_223ait,null,1433190375,28,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,28

Additionally, the moment a competitor opened near by, tesco would develop the land into a store.

Oh god, you are...I do so hate it when people just blindly repeat themselves under the apparent impression that they're adding something to the discussion (isn't this fun?).

I was making my original statement because I don't really give much legitimacy to prosecuting/ punishing someone for something they haven't been convicted of. We don't arrest people on arriving back in the UK for smoking weed in Amsterdam - do they do that in the USA too?

For a different example, how many people who have gotten married at the age of 17 have been prosecuted when arriving in California, where the minimum legal age is 18?

I grew up in an area where there was a chain convenience store named Bells Stores (A chain which was bought out by Sainsbury's). So for the first 18 years of my life there was a shop run/managed well and open 7am-11pm every day. It was just like a supermarket but smaller and slightly inflated prices, and I thought this was just the norm.

But then I moved to university... and the only shops in the area were run down corner shops. They had a number of problems:

1. Their opening hours were often 9am-9pm, meaning they were shut if I ever needed milk or anything on a morning. Their closing time wasn't bad, but they weren't open at all on a sunday.

2. They sold no frozen goods.

3. They were always low on bread and their fruit/vegetable section had really poor quality items. 

4. The toileteries were hugely overpriced (Like £3-4 for a small can of unbranded deoderant).

5. They sold loose individual toilet rolls (Seriously? Why the fuck would anybody buy those!)

6. The shelves stacked with groceries were often disorganised, cans riddled with dents in them etc.

7. They would retain out of date items simply until they sold, sometimes even covered in dust.

8. One of the staff members kept his open carton of milk in the same fridge as products for customers, taking a swig of it when he occasionally went past. If you did this in a Sainsbury's local you would be sacked.

There are a few more points, but they're probably just nitpicking or my perception of what a quality item is (Not liking their sliced ham, or their orange juice drink, probably isn't a valid critiscism).

The main problem in my opinion is just lack of organisation. Logistics is a big issue, they often don't get enough deliveries for Bread, Milk etc. throughout the week resulting in either a stock shortage at the end of the week, or a lot of leftover stock beyond the sell by date (depending on demand). Smaller, more frequent deliveries would obviously be beneficial.

Another issue is lack of adequate stock control (Sort of links with logistics). Often they would run out of a non perishable item I use, but woudn't re-stock. I sometimes had to specifically request that they order more in. It seems like they don't a) Keep track of what they sell, or how much and b) Don't track when things are nearing their sell by date (If there is rotten fruit in your shop, remove it from the shelf!)

Smaller shops are often family run and therefore have a staff shortage. This limits opening times, but it also has an impact whilst the shop is open too, with only one or two staff members in store at any one time, it means a lot of non obvious jobs go unfinished (Rearranging shelves, stock checking, general housekeeping, price labelling etc. all of which have a negative effect).

All of these issues result in more people choosing to visit larger stores further away. Simply being close to your customers isn't the only thing you need to be convenient. We pay a premium on products at your shop already, but you need to have everything else in order otherwise we will go elsewhere.",0,1396528080,null,0,1396534034,0,cgiz43d,t3_2238j3,t1_cgiz43d,t3_2238j3,null,1433190665,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

In certain situations, I feel having played before has influence your idea on the team. 

2 examples off the top of my head focusing on where personal experience alter view of the game 

1. In transfer debates, some talk about replacing pretty much most of the defense (seen many combinations of selling Agger, Johnson, Enrique, Toure, Skrtel) which I disagree and would rather keeping our defense with maybe ONE replacement/new players due to knowing how hard it can be to adapt to a new team with a complete new style. Similar to Spurs this year.

When we get new foreign players like Aspas, I seem to be a lot more understanding and give them a lot more time (2 years) before making a negative decision on them due to understanding how hard it is to play if you can't communicate or have time to settle with the players. I play for a Chinese team yet as they speak mandarin and i speak Cantonese, its near impossible for me to be half as effective as when I play with English speaking players due to language barrier.

My, touchy today, aren't we?

I don't have kids, wouldn't dream of inflicting the horrible little fuckers on a world woefully ill-equiped to deal with the numbers already here, but if I did and was given the choice of them smoking or vaping I'd happily encourage them to vape.

Nicotine is generally considered to be horribly dangerous, however there's [strong evidence](http://www.ecigarette-politics.com/easyblog/nicotine-high-toxicity-myth-destroyed.html) that it's not. Also, you have to bear in mind that nic is [very common in the natural world](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/15/nicotine-in-vegetables_n_1597087.html), so the chances of your kids ""ingesting even a tiny amount of it"" is in fact pretty damned high.

The previous poster was incorrect in saying ""nic is not harmful"". Like most things in life, if overdone it's harmful. 

I vape strong ejuices, drink alcohol in moderate qantities, drink tea in far greater quantities and occasionally smoke weed. In excess any of these can have a detrimental effect on my health, but in moderation they're less harmful than the bansturbators would have you think.

In short, [nicotine isn't the demon](http://www.ecigarette-politics.com/the-great-nicotine-myth.html) that so many people would have you think it is.

* Banks should not be allowed to create money

true,KultureShoque,eng-rutland,"May Be Foreign, Beware","Hmm, not easy to explain briefly but I'll try. 

My context - Reality is created by the stories we believe. 

Let's say there was a class of people who enjoy tremendous privilege and luxury due to the fact they have vast amounts of money. Let's say members of that class don't want people getting uppity about why they have that money and why having it gives you so much power. Let's say they realise their power will be least challenged if most people don't even recognise it exists. Let's say they don't want people getting all uppity about the fact that modern industrial civilisation is ruining the ecosystem and is threatening to undermine the planet's capacity to sustain life. 

Let's say those people own the media. 

If you want to minimise the likelihood that people will actually demand action be taken about real problems because the consequences would mean a loss of your power and wealth, there are many everyday psychological tools available. Making anyone concerned about the environment look like a hysteric is just one tool. In order to achieve this, you put out lots of clearly hyperbolic stories and then conflate more sensible expressions of concern with the hyporbolae you created. So now anyone expressing any concern about the environment is part of the group of crazy fuckers associated with the hyperbolic story and can be easily dismissed. 

Ordinary people quickly internalise this mode of thinking and what you then get is a population that furiously defends the prevailing orthodoxy (in our case that modern civilisation is the best  and only way for humanity to thrive and is not a destructive force that might lead to a mass die off in the next 50 years). You can see this in action here insofar as anyone suggesting a slight deviation from the accepted stories is told to put on their tin-foil hat. For instance, questioning the financial system is treated mostly with derision bordering on the abusive even though in 2008 the system almost collapsed which would have been catastrophic for many people. The instability is well known to have been caused by massive fraud, gambling, money printing and irresponsible lending, it's not even controversial.

Anyway, the ruling classes don't want a large number of people to feel concerned enough about issues that might undermine their power. They employ many methods to try to limit the possibility of a well informed population and, more importantly, a population that feels it can enact changes. 

The ruling classes own the media. 

One way you can squash an issue is to highlight it in a silly or hysterical way and then conflate anyone who talks about the issue with the silliness and hysteria. So instead of you reacting to the story about pollution by calling for us to do whatever it takes to minimise it, you think - this is just alarmism, I will ignore the problem and even laugh at people who try to talk about it. 

EDIT: The Big Agenda is to maintain and increase the power of the ruling classes while making the public think they are living in a participatory society in which they have a say in how it's run. I don't think the agenda is set by cigar smoking men in a room but it's set by a culture of power and privilege that is cultivated by schools, parents and the workplace. Jon Snow might think he's informing the public but his programming is to serve the powerful. No one has to tell him to do it and if he steps out of line, the culture will spit him out.

&gt;If service A costs more than service B to provide, but the law makes it illegal to charge more for A than B, then the price of B must rise to take account for the added cost of A.

Traffic is traffic. This is already accounted for in Peering agreements or 95th percentile billing. 

Peering agreements are between two network POPs (Point Of Presence) where both parties in the agreement think that the amount of traffic moving back and forth between the networks is about roughly equal. In cases where traffic is unequal (say BT connecting to Netflix's network, more traffic will go from Netflix -&gt; BT than the other way) then there is a discussion to be had with regards to compensation. Typically it is in the ISP's (BTs) interest to have lots of bandwidth connecting to popular services, peering agreements make accounting much easier and is often cheaper than 95th percentile billing.

95th percentile billing charges per mbit the average utilisation of your network port at 5 minute intervals over a month. The price per mbit varies depending on the network you're connecting to (Better connected = more expensive).

If *your* data is latency and jitter sensitive then you need to seek out a network provider which offers guarantees on latency and jitter, this would be a dark fibre network and not public internet. The data is important to you but not necessarily anyone else. 

The network providers are *already being paid* for delivering the data, trying to differentiate traffic and charge a premium for delivery amounts to them double-dipping and makes the internet more expensive.

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"It might be true that telecos will seek to put any theoretical cost on to consumers but there are 2 things which hopefully will mean they won't. 

1. The biggest telecos in the EU own subsidiaries in numerous other EU countries. [I found then re-coloured some maps](http://imgur.com/a/ej3CI) which showed where each company has subsidiaries and as you can see each company has a network in many countries. In many cases when I go to an EU country I'm using the network of my provider through a subsidiary but they charge me anyway. If they aren't using their own network they are paying one of the others to get access to their network. They then get that most of that money back when another company want's access to their network. The actual net-cost of no roaming fees to the telecos seems relatively low to me but it's a cash cow for them so naturally they want to keep it. 

2. Part of the reason why costs are often so high is the market for roaming licences has remained pretty unregulated. Big market leaders charge huge prices to small competitors while the whole process of being able to agree with your competitors what you will pay each other for access to networks just screams anti-competition. Part of the genesis for this idea was that there was a lack of national competition for roaming customers. Admittedly it's more of a problem for business customers and those on the Continent who cross borders every day and get fucked over because or it or have to buy two phone contracts. Either way, competition will be increased by limiting the ability to companies to collude to set roaming prices and the ability to smaller companies to develop without being charged excessive licence fees driving prices down. 

EDIT: Just for some context which I don't think the article gives - companies with excessive roaming costs will be forced to allow customers to temporarily switch to other companies with lower costs while they are abroad, thus incentivising companies to keep down costs until late 2016 or so when the costs should be lowered to the same as national levels. That one area where the competition will come in. Big telecos may even benefit from this if they can keep their costs down but the law should, I think allow smaller telecos to join forces in cross border alliances to benefit from the effect of scale and keep costs down hence more competition. That's why Vodafone has been lobbying the EU because they stand to lose the benefit they get from being so huge and they will be faced with something like 3 national companies joining together to offer prices in each state at cheaper prices than Vodafone can over all 3; they've been claiming they just want to ensure their customers are will informed but it's clearly bullshit.

There are similar issues with versions of Java &lt;1.6.

Both of these were major platforms for ""enterprise"" software.

There are also many web-based applications which use ActiveX controls and such that no longer work in modern versions of IE, due to changes in the browser's security model, etc.

Big organisations, like governments are used to using mainframe platforms where the same software can continue running for decades.

Torres' hasn't been all that bad, bar the lack of scoring. But again, the same could be said for our other strikers.

Most creative sorts tend to congregate in East London: Dalston, Hackney, Brick Lane, Shoreditch and Old Street (the latter two being the most central, Hackney's a bit stabby but probably the most affordable, Brick Lane is alright and I don't really know Dalston).

However if you're earning the UK equivalent of the above, you're only going to be able to afford to house-share in one of them. 

If you can't afford any of the above areas, try Bow/the Roman Road where you'll have easy bus access to them but probably pay less rent. Also Bethnal Green, which is a bit shit in terms of things to do but full of creative types and students because it's still reasonably affordable.

No more than any other day. I just don't like being talked down to... but who does?

As for the rest: I must admit I was of a mind that it was more harmful than it probably is, but I think I'd need to see more new research before being convinced it's as harmless as the commonly suggested caffeine – although I'm sure if caffeine was sold in such a concentrated form it too would have its dangers. The fact there are naturally occurring trace amounts of nicotine found in vegetables isn't really a compelling argument for declaring it safe. 

I've fully given up a 20+/day habit twice in my life. Once in my early twenties and once again in my mid forties after another several years of smoking – don't ask me why I started up again after a decade off, suffice it say I was an idiot. The first time I stopped used a combination of willpower and polo mints – taking a terrible toll on my teeth :( – and the second time I started off using patches, but eventually switched to chewing gums as I was getting palpitations on the patches. I could still get them from overusing the gums, but I felt I had more control over it. I've always assumed it was caused directly by the nicotine – there certainly seemed to be a corollary effect – but I suppose in hindsight it could just as easily have been a trigger to something psychosomatic. Anyway, I'm glad to say I'm done with all that now.

It *was* interesting to read that e-cigarette politics blog's argument about the lack of evidence for it being addictive, though. Although it strikes me as a bit of a disingenuous argument, because why would it be a helpful aid to quitting otherwise? It also reminds me a bit of the tobacco companies' similar denials in the past. I think we can all agree that there's *something* in tobacco that gets us hooked, but maybe it's not as clear cut what it is. Again, further research is probably merited, although it might be difficult persuading people who've never smoked to take part in a trial that could potentially set them off.",0,1396535946,null,0,false,0,cgj1tmo,t3_21zzkb,t1_cgj1tmo,t1_cgiziha,null,1433191943,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Sure, but 6 years ago there was no immediate problem. There was no issue with .Net 1.1 on XP. [According to Microsoft](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2489698) .Net 1.1 doesn't run on Windows 7 either (although Googling found some unsupportable hacks that might make it work). My main .Net experience has been with ASP.Net, so, admittedly, I'm not sure what client-side changes between 1.x and 2.x are important, but I know that moving a large web application to 2.x can be a _major_ pain.


With Java it's less clear. Oracle have updated Java 1.4+ (32-bit only, 1.5 is needed on 64-bit Windows) to work with Windows 7, but only 1.6+ to work with 8. Some corporate systems have rather ""fragile"" setups with multiple versions of Java for different applications, so this is likely to cause headaches. There is still Java 1.3-based software in use in ""enterprise"" environments.

Because Yashika was now over 18, she's treated as a single adult and therefore processed separately so if her mother's really that bothered she could leave right now as well.

She completes her A Levels... then what?  She gets into university... can't deport her now because she's aced her first year, wouldn't be fair.  She's graduated?  Got a job here?  Started a family?  LOL good luck deporting her now.

By the way, they have A Levels in Mauritius... accredited by the University of Cambridge and sat simultaneously with other A Level students worldwide just like in Hong Kong etc.  The idea of ""not being able to complete my studies"" is utter bollocks and this actually works out better than the distance learning option I proposed further up.

Mauritius is *not* a dangerous, war-torn cesspit with a broken justice system and no womens' rights; it's a modern functioning democracy which people spend thousands of pounds to visit as tourists.

He's scoring goals at a rate so much higher than any of our other strikers too. 29 goals in 59 games, in the Premier League no less, is pretty close to world class, and I think Mourinho is exactly the right person to take him to the next level. 

Anyone who doubts Lukaku should be ashamed. This is a man who LOVES the club. He cried the first time he went to Stamford Bridge. He has all the desire in the world to become the first team striker at Chelsea FC and I think he should be given an opportunity to prove himself at home, under the tutelage of Jose Mourinho. 

Anyone who claims selling Lukaku is a good idea is just daft. And anyone who is not irate at these reports should take a look at themselves in the mirror.

Diego Costa or Cavani for striker position, recall Lukaku, keep Eto'o as 3rd choice.

true,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;The internet was certainly designed on a principle of net neutrality, but it was also designed on a principle of lost/late packets don't really matter that much. In terms of stuff like video streaming or gaming, those things DO matter and exceptions have to be made as far as making sure this content gets there in a timely manner.

On the whole, yes. However the software designer would have picked the most appropriate / applicable traffic type for the application long before it reached the light of day. 

For fast-paced gaming (Counter Strike, Halo etc) there is UDP, which is a 'best effort' protocol. If the packet doesn't make it to it's destination within a given amount of time then it gets dropped and nothing more is done.

For video streaming (again, let's take Video Conferencing) these solutions may use RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol) on top of TCP. TCP is a 'reliable' protocol in that your packets will do their very best to arrive and keep trying until they do. Once they reach the other end, the packets are sorted into order and display a nice smooth video image.

UDP (best effort) traffic would suffer the most under traffic discrimination, because hey, it's not TCP (reliable) and therefore by it's nature less important.

&gt;Correct me if I'm wrong but AFAIK, there are two steps to that: provider -&gt; ISP and ISP -&gt; consumer.

For most traffic (without peering) it would be Provider &lt;-&gt; NSP (Network Service Provider, an ISP for ISPs) &lt;-&gt; Lots of hopping aorund &lt;-&gt; ISP &lt;-&gt; Consumer. 

With peering it would be Provider &lt;-&gt; ISP &lt;-&gt; Consumer.

&gt;As far as the second is concerned it's advantageous for an ISP to stick an artificial delay on less time-sensitive content if the network is under heavy use, yes?

Advantageous for who? is the question. 

NSPs are seeing content providers like Google and Netflix and Spotify make lots of money and are thinking ""Hey... We want a slice of their profits for using our networks. Sure they already pay us, but they have lots of money and we can hold them to ransom by making their service worse"". The situation descends into an arms race where the Providers are paying large amounts of money to make sure their traffic arrives when it should. Microsoft might pay more for Bing searches to have priority over Google searches for instance. That's bad for everyone except the NSPs.

The logical conclusion for the approach is that you end up paying for 'channels' of internet through your ISP. An extra £5 per month to get access to the Netflix link, £2 extra for Spotify, £8 per month for iPlayer, all on top of the basic cost of your subscriptions and connection. There is no tangible benefit except to the balance sheets of NSPs.",0,1396537455,null,0,1396537651,0,cgj2h94,t3_223fbz,t1_cgj2h94,t1_cgj1c27,null,1433192321,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I think the bigger issue with things like java is as you mention the configuration problem, you also have flakey installs that get you into DLL hell if you install software in different order.  Again this is mostly as a result of bad software, people not following the advice *fully*.

Back in 2012 I worked on updating an in browser ActiveX control for windows 7 use.  The only reason work was needed was really for the HTML to be updated, as it used features which have been stopped in browsers (title/border less popups).  IIRC all I did was sign the existing component and fix bugs in the code that were functional, rather than platform related.

I still find the big problem people have isn't the software, but the installation, configuration of it.  Larger firms don't make this easier by actually having a locked down default build for their windows 7 image.  The app on XP that requires admin privs doesn't work, it gets attributed to windows 7, rather than the configuration of the roll out.

&gt;Am I supposed to read everything you've ever wrote, before I reply to your comments?

Why, is reading the comments you're replying to that hard? Maybe it's comprehension that's not your strong point.

&gt;Except it was your original comment which didn't add anything. 

Yes, it did. And you're repeating yourself *again*.

&gt;It didn't make sense, because it was already covered in the article.

So why would I be stating it? And are you on repeat-to-fade, now?

&gt;apparently we're all supposed to read your mind and know know your intent before replying, too.

'We?' You're speaking on behalf of the whole of reddit, now?

&gt;Oh! Now you explain! Why didn't you do this in the first place?

Because of the point I was making - I didn't expect anyone to be a dick from the outset. And then repeat themselves, even after I've explained where I was coming from.

&gt;However, if America doesn't want to let her in, America doesn't have to - in turn, that's America's business.

Sure, anything that happens anywhere else in the world has no moral aspect, because it's not in the UK. Got it.

As I said before, I assumed you were more knowledgable on the subject and were one of the rabid anti-vapers. Had I known you weren't, I might have explained the points more patiently. As much my fault as yours.

&gt; don't ask me why I started up again after a decade off, suffice it say I was an idiot.

This is something that interests me. Whenever I used to try to quit and lapsed, I'd hate myself when I did. Now, with vaping, I've happily resigned myself to being an unrepentant addict. Indeed, I'll occasionally smoke to be sociable, and weirdly I don't give a damn like I did when I was trying to quit. I've learned that a lot of other vapers feel the same way.

&gt;  I've always assumed it was caused directly by the nicotine

It probably was. When I first started, if I was mixing my own ejuice and got some on my hands I'd notice my heart-rate would rise slightly for 10-20 mins. Obviously that was the nicotine. 18 months later I don't notice it because I've built up a resistance to it. If you were to take up vaping tomorrow you'd probably find that 6mg would be more than enough for you, whereas I find that anything less that 18mg isn't worth vaping, I prefer 24mg or more. That's usually enough to set my heavy smoker friends coughing their lungs up.

You're of a similar age, you probably remember the same adverts as I do from the 70s and 80s. The problem is that nic's not really as terrible as people make it out to be, yet it's the evil weed still to many folks.  If us vapers can convince them that it's not as evil as we were told by people who really didn't know better at the time then the chances are good that ecigs will become even more socially acceptable than they already are and, maybe, smoking tobacco will become a thing of the past.


&gt; although it might be difficult persuading people who've never smoked to take part in a trial that could potentially set them off.

Yeah, that might be considered a bit off.

Had the government (and councils) maintained investment in social housing, creating enough homes to meet the demand, the bedroom tax would have been a perfectly viable policy. Implementing the policy with such a housing deficit was completely stupid, both economically and politically.

If anyone has worked under a shit boss (and i mean truly shit, incompetent, condescending etc.) in any job knows the feeling of just trying to get through the day with their job. Just because the players are paid well doesn't mean they are exempt from the same reaction.

This is a group of professional athletes who have experience playing for some very, very talented managers (LvG, Scolari, Capello, Del Bosque, SAF for example) and in clubs with high end set ups (Real, United, Lyon, Ajax). These guys already understand passion and drive, they need guidance on tactics and strategy. Unfortunately for the players Tim doesn't seem to have a grasp on tactics and strategy.

So you have a group of players who are desperate for a plan and a direction and instead they have a manager who consistently plays players out of there best position, a manager who consistently changes lineups, who doesn't adjust to what the opponent does on the field. Even more frustrating is that they have a manager who bleets on about ""passion"" and ""fire"", who calls his players out in public, who says the players ""capitulated"", who refers to the team as ""them"" and ""they"", who talks about players ""playing for their future"", who watches the matches from the stands and states that he ""can't influence the match"" from the sideline (which by the way is his job to at least try and influence the match). This is a manager who despite all his passion couldn't be bothered to watch the match against LFC from earlier in the season to see if he could learn from previous mistakes. A manager who spoke about his lack of trust of his players, a manager who said he had never taken the time to watch 2 of his players extensively (Paulinho and Capoue).  All of this seems to stack up to a manager who doesn't understand how to appropriately prepare himself or the squad to succeed.

This is now a squad who have been left to drift by a manager who wasn't qualified to do the job in the first place.

Given all of this it is in no way surprising that members of the squad would be unhappy and dialling out on the manager and the season. Quite honestly, its amazing that they have lasted this long. 

We may not like it, but sadly it is somewhat understandable. Fortunately this is something that can be corrected, really the question is can it be corrected before talented players write off playing for the club in the future.

The reality of the software development industry is that sticking with one company -- unless it's a company that hugely values fair wages -- can have a big negative impact on a developers income, switching company every couple of years is *how* people in software development make the good money, sticking with one company is a sure fire way to stay on a shitty wage unless you found one of the few great companies.

If you put together a good cv and start speaking to recruiters and applying to jobs online you can get a very good idea of your actual worth and then you can approach your employers about it: either they give you a fair salary (because you *know* what you're worth based on other employment offers) or you're going to take a different job. Focusing on maximising your earnings doesn't make you a bad person or anything!

Although it's nice that you don't want to leave your co-workers in the lurch, think about it this way: if you can find a job paying £35k elsewhere and you stick with your current employer, you're paying £12k a year to keep your co-workers unlurched. I sure as hell would not pay £12k a year to keep my co-workers unlurched!

As an aside, I bet that the co-worker you mention who has never touched .net in his life is probably getting similar to your salary, if that's the case it's a pretty good demonstration of how unvalued you are :) I know people doing IT in the north making more than your salary, IT! Developers should be making more than IT! :p

My advice is just put together a good CV and start looking at new jobs, you don't *have* to take new jobs so there's no reason to not do it, and it'll give you a much better idea of where you're at (the value of your skills etc).",0,1396540464,null,0,false,0,cgj3vt3,t3_223jqy,t1_cgj3vt3,t1_cgj3g7r,null,1433192982,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

I figured people would be wondering what in the hell an article like this was doing in this sub, so I changed the title to reflect the content in the article. I usually don't do this because it looks like I am sensationalizing the headline, which I very may well be doing. Anyway, I found this article very interesting, and it's definitely worth the read. Here is a little tid bit from the publishers on their reasoning:

&gt;A defamatory statement—in this case, a potential libel—is a false statement that undermines the reputation of the person about whom the statement is made.   In a court of law, the fact-finder cannot just accept the writer or publisher’s assertion that a statement is true.   In England in particular, a libel claimant can require the writer and publisher to prove truth, which in the case of your book, would be extremely difficult to do for many of the claims you make.  We have no reason to doubt the veracity of what you say, but we believe the risk is high that those implicated in the premise of the book—that Putin has a close circle of criminal oligarchs at his disposal and has spent his career cultivating this circle—would be motivated to sue and could afford to do so.  Even if the Press was ultimately successful in defending such a lawsuit, the disruption and expense would be more than we could afford, given our charitable and academic mission.

Basically, the publisher (Cambridge University Press) refuses to publish this book, even though the people mentioned in the book are listed on visa sanctions by the US and EU, because said people could potentially sue over defamation. Even though they would probably lose, the legal costs would be significant.

I have never heard of a book being refused to be published in the UK for this reason, or for any other reason. The author is now looking to publish this book in the US.

I figured this topic is a little different from the usual topics discussed here, and wanted to gin up a little conversation on the merits of not publishing books.",0,1396540806,null,0,false,0,cgj41rq,t3_22408n,t1_cgj41rq,t3_22408n,null,1433193059,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

There is a marginal benefit of using gift allowances each year rather than making a one-off gift but this depends on how many years it will take to gift the whole sum. In your example it takes 13 years, which is a long time considering the 7 year taper relief which has been lost.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The general opinion of him seems to be shifting from underrated to overrated IMO. The guy is decent, he runs a lot, tracks back and passes well. But he isn't showing the promise he did second half last season when he was one of our best players in terms of getting goals and final passes. He seems to have gone back to his own shell, much like Sterling, but to a lesser degree.

He isn't very confident on the ball, the difference between him and Allen is like the difference between Agger and Skrtel, both reach 90%+ passing, but their confidence on the ball is very different. Henderson under pressure is great at one-two, but he doesn't turn players and move into space, obviously Allen is much shorter and has easier time turning and moving in small spaces. But nonetheless, I feel Henderson is great utility player, but the people saying he should start worldcup are a bit blinded by our current form.

He is a midfielder and probably 4 years off his peak, but I feel that until he combines his intensity with a better composure on the ball, he will become squad player much like Lucas and Allen. Great for certain tactical choice, but not complete enough to be used everytime. Saying that, he is probably as good as any of the big name buys people overrate, Paulinho/Sandro/Dembele for Spurs, Mikel/Ramires for Chelsea and Flamini/Arteta/current Wilshere etc. He needs to add finishing to his game, he fucked up couple of good chances this season that won't come again unless we score 90+ again.

Bittorrent isn't the only thing disproportinonately hogging the network though, we also have things like Netflix.

Netflix is different to bittorrent of course. In this case the network provider can not only charge the consumer for not throttling the bandwidth hogging stuff but the provider as well.

Now, as you say, the big players will pay more to get data onto the network, but what about the last mile to the consumers house? Isn't that where the bulk of the congestion is and where traffic shaping / net neutrality comes into play?

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"I wouldn't mind having a go. To save space, instead of quoting the bit I'm referring to, I'll just do 2.1 or something like that, the first number being the heading, and second being the bullet point under it.

1.2) UKIP constantly underplay the role the EU has in employment in our country, and our trade. The EU are our largest trade market, and leaving reduces the chance of companies making jobs in the UK, as it won't be as certain we will have tariff free trade. We can't just assume EU countries will all sign free trade deals with us. 

2.2) This seems widely unfair. At 18, without paying any taxes, I am entitled to benefits, free healthcare, and a plethora of other things, not including the free education and services I have had beforehand. If an immigrant comes here, and pays taxes, why should they also have to pay more on top of that, money which a UK citizen wouldn't have to pay? A policy like is not only massively unfair, but would discourage people from moving to the country, as the costs would be much higher and there would be no safety net if they became unemployed.

3.1) Again, overplaying the issue. It ignores the millions of British people who live and work in the EU thanks to these rules (I couldn't find a definite figure, but looked at [this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_diaspora)), doesn't mention the number of the jobs which are skilled (which UKIP wants to support, skilled migration), and exaggerates the effects of £55m a day, which is a drop in the ocean compared to total government spending. 

3.3) Workfare. I don't agree with that in principle, making people work for less than minimum wage.

3.4) Stopping all 'green' stuff is backwards looking. 

3.6) We are one of the richest countries in the world, and foreign aid helps people who are starving and dying in countries which are much worse off than us. Morally, I don't agree with cutting foreign aid. 

4.2) Rubbish rhetoric. I assume this plays on the 'life should mean life' spiel, even though 'life' has never meant 'life in prison', rather that's the maximum sentence. I don't agree we should keep people in prison for the sake of it, and if they are reformed, and have served a decent time, then let them out on parole.

4.3) I see no reason to stop prisoners from voting. Democracy should be a human right, and even prisoners deserve that.

4.5) Clegg mentioned the figures the other day of the number of criminals this allowed us to extradite, and it was in the hundreds. If you want figures, I can look them up, but it seems UKIP are only opposing this because it's got 'European' in it.

4.6) Looking at where our government and the ECHR come into conflict, I would much rather us stay in than allow our government to, for example, send people to countries where they could be tortured. Human Rights apply to all, even foreigners, and even suspected criminals.

5.3) Seems like a cheap way to attack migrants more than anything. If I have lived in an area for a while, perhaps was born there, I should not be shoved to the back of a queue just because I wasn't born there.

5.5) This has no real explanation of who is 'lazy', and how they would get them off benefits. I assume it is related to workfare, which I said earlier I disagree with. I also disagree with the bit about stopping foreigners getting it. Someone shouldn't be in a situation where, under UKIP, they have spent 4 years paying taxes, and for education and healthcare, then are forced to leave if they get made unemployed.

6.1) Political correctness gone mad, has it? Again, nothing more than rhetoric.

6.2) I assume that means UN international laws as well? I haven't seen anywhere that UKIP are planning to pull us out of that.

6.3) We shouldn't be indoctrinating children at our schools, putting blinkers on them and telling them how brilliant our country is. Children should be allowed to develop and think on their own, even if that means opposing the country, or its actions. This is one thing I am fundamentally against. 

There are some half decent policies in there, like not taxing minimum wage, not cutting front line policing and stuff, but I think the bad massively outweighs the good. If you want me to expand on anything, or think I'm talking bollocks, I'm happy to expand a bit.

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","There's a markets argument for net neutrality: a non-neutral net involves hidden charges, and there is never pressure to reduce hidden charge.

To put an example together I pay Netflix £9.99/month for their service, plus £5/month to my ISP for service. Unbeknownst to me, Netflix then pays my ISP £2/month for the service that I thought I was already getting, because otherwise, I can't have Netflix.

The market pressure on the ISP is to reduce the amount they charge me, not the amount they charge Netflix; beyond a certain size, an ISP can simply blackmail content providers such as Netflix into paying what the ISP deems reasonable, and Netflix has no choice but to pay - imagine having to say that if you use Sky, BT, TalkTalk or Virgin Media, you are no longer a potential customer for Netflix, and imagine what that does to Netflix's business model. Netflix's other choice is to pay £2/month per user, or whatever the big ISPs want. And there's no incentive for any ISP to charge Netflix less - if the underlying cost of providing service goes down, the incentive is to give me a reduction in what I pay.

Further, there's no room for an ISP who charges Netflix less to enter the market - who would sign up for an ISP that charges them more for the same service as the Big Four? Note that until such an ISP is larger, Netflix won't pay them - no point when you can pocket the £2/month as extra profit easily.

In a weakly neutral world, I pay Netflix £5.99/month; I pay my ISP £5/month for service. If my ISP feels that I'm not paying enough for service (say because I'm using Netflix), they make me pay more (e.g. by saying there's an £2/month supplement if I want to use Netflix). A competitor can come in and offer me better service for less money - for example, £6/month for the same as my ISP's £5/month service, but with nothing blocked). Of course, if the competitor's business model is unsustainable (e.g. because the service I need costs £7/month to provide), they'll go out of business.

This is the minimum point needed to make the free market do its thing. However, it doesn't prevent ISPs from using their ownership of big customer bases to victimise competitors in other areas - e.g. victimizing Netflix specifically because you have an existing VOD service you want your customers to pay for.

In a strongly neutral world, it's almost the same as in the weakly neutral world, but with one difference; my ISP now has to find a way to charge me that isn't targeting specific services. So, for example, my ISP can say ""you're throttled to an average of 100kbit/s per hour, but can burst at up to 100MBit/s for 10 seconds - pay more, and we increase the average throttle"" (targeting all services that need high sustained throughput), or ""minimum RTT on this service is 150 ms - pay more, and we'll drop the minimum RTT"" (targeting all services that need low latency).

Because you have to apply your restrictions in a service-independent fashion, you can't just say ""Netflix competes with our VoD product - let's add an £5/month Netflix fee to the ISP bill, and block Netflix if you don't pay"". Instead, you have to work out what it is about Netflix traffic that's expensive to handle, and then tell me that if I want traffic that matches the ""expensive"" profile, I have to pay more.

This is the world where the free market really shines - yes, the ISP has to spend some extra time working out why Netflix traffic is expensive to carry, but then it can charge me accordingly. If another ISP can carry my traffic for less money (say because they've got a cheap supply of 40G routers), they can outcompete mine and get me to move. And no-one gets to victimise a competitor by using their power in the ISP market to cripple competition in another market.",0,1396542328,null,0,false,0,cgj4sbs,t3_223fbz,t1_cgj4sbs,t1_cgj1c27,null,1433193406,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"BitTorrent is a bit of a network monster, and a great example for 'extreme' uses of networks. Firstly it gobbles up bandwidth. It's very efficient at distributing a lot of data to lots of clients. There is no practical way of caching those little chunks of data, so a large % of that data has to go out to the internet, rather than hitting ISP's cache servers. This costs money.

Secondly amongst those clients there's a lot of session initiation and teardown chatter which takes up memory in the routers which make up the internet. This pissed off the ISPs and NSPs because they were forced to finally upgrade their ancient kit.

It was a bit of a nightmare scenario for ISPs who only allocate a very small amount of bandwidth per customer (Sky allocate about 300kbit/month/customer, roughly 100GB). Suddenly all of their connections were lit up with huge amounts of data and sessions flying all over the shop. Hence the fairly fierce clampdown on BitTorrent-style services.

Netflix is less of a problem because content *can* be cached. You may only need to reach into your ISP's network to download the latest Netflix offerings (because they're popular they live in cache). The other aspect is that it barely uses any upload traffic, this means traffic patterns are nice and predictable. This makes the network engineers lives easier when they're trying to plan for future growth.

There's a reason that the majorty of cheap public connections are asymmetric (Fast download, slow upload). The industry want customers to be consumers because it's easier to manage.

&gt;Now, as you say, the big players will pay more to get data onto the network, but what about the last mile to the consumers house? Isn't that where the bulk of the congestion is and where traffic shaping / net neutrality comes into play?

If it costs the big players more to get connected, that cost will be passed on to the consumer. It's a barrier to entry and economics tells us this is bad. The EU is more committed to free trade than the US is.

Congestion in the last mile from the green box (BT or Virgin) back to the core network isn't what Net Neutrality about. That is the domain of OFCOM and a different kettle of fish.

Congestion inside the ISP core network trying to reach other networks is where Net Neutrality matters. BT's Wholesale Broadband Connect platform (WBC) is where all the residential connections converge and get routed from, aka, the backhaul. Here's a bit of information about Congestion inside BT's WBC today: http://www.thinkbroadband.com/news/6367-is-bt-wholesale-putting-new-connections-on-hold.html

Traffic Shaping is about maintaining quality for the majority of users on an ISP's network. What Net Neutrality is about is discriminating between traffic moving between networks, outside of ISPs (specifically between NSPs and content providers).

&gt;With it being made illegal to charge the provider more for un-throttled service, the costs must end up at the consumer side of the equation.

The actual wording is quite important. From the article:
&gt;Providers of internet access to end-users shall not discriminate between functionally equivalent services and applications.

That says that *all* BitTorrent based services must be subject to the same throttling. *All* Netflix-type services must be subject to the same throttling. *All* Spotify-type services must be subject to the same throttling. This prevents preferential traffic provisioning while maintaining Traffic Shaping as a useful tool for preserving network quality for the majority. We may see some wriggling about specific definitions and overlaps, but these will be hammered down quite quickly.

We may end up with internet services which offer different 'types' of bandwidth. Perhaps 10GB of gaming traffic, 10GB of Streaming Traffic and 10GB of Web-browsing traffic. It's not really desirable (in my opinion) but premium 'unrestricted' products will always exist for those who want them. It's the best of all worlds. :)

The working class were poor, and so looked for food stuffs which were cheap, in plentiful supply and easy to prepare.\nThe savoury pie had long been a traditional way of preserving food, as well as in its smaller handsized form a transportable meal, protected safe from the surrounding dirt by its cold pastry crust.

If we were having this conversation next year when he were on a free and Toure were retiring, then I might perhaps look at this differently, but as it stands he would be a waste of money better spent on a solid LB, a position where we actually lack depth.

I'm glad you eventually did. TIL. To be honest I didn't even know ""rabidly anti-vapers"" existed. If I had I probably would have phrased some of my responses differently. My only aim from the beginning was to disabuse people of the idea that nicotine itself was harmless.

&gt;I'll occasionally smoke to be sociable…

That's what set me off again, along with being a pisshead at the time. I had a friend who'd quit but still occasionally smoked the odd one or two on nights out and claimed it didn't bother him, so I thought I could probably do the same. But within days of trying it I was kidding myself with all the usual excuses: *'I'll just smoke this one packet and that'll be it', 'I've quit before so I can do it again... soon!', 'Ok so I guess I'll have to go through fully quitting again, I just need to be in the right frame of mind. Maybe tomorrow…'*, etc. Before I knew it I was back up to 20+/day and then suddenly six years went by! 

If I've learned anything from that experience it's that we're all different and what works for one person won't necessarily work for another. Also how you are with one drug is no indicator of how you may be with another. One of my old drinking buddies from that time is now a recovering alcoholic and can't even take a sip without going all out to get blotto.

As for the lights - all good signs! The red LED indicates power is going to the unit - the green LED flashes when the miner is in use.

As for power usage - the units can get hot. One of the big differences between the U1 and U2 is the additional of the built in heat-sink. Unfortunately there's no built in temperature monitoring in the units - but they should be good to run without any additional cooling at the default hash rate. If you've got multiple units - or they are kept in a hot environment - it may be advisable to invest in a cheap USB fan. When I was running 10 of the U1's - I got one of those cheap flexible USB fans and plugged it into a spare USB port to provide additional cooling.

My U2's have been running at their default hash rate since we received the stock and I've had no trouble so far. The one note of caution I'd advise is to leave the units to cool a little before you remove them -the heat sink can get quite hot to the touch.

Happy mining - and any questions just give us a shout!

And not sure you understand what Paedophilia means so let me [enlighten you](http://focus.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=53036&amp;resultClick=1).

&gt;Pedophilia is a clinical diagnosis usually made by a psychiatrist or psychologist. It is not a criminal or legal term, such as forcible sexual offense, which is a legal term often used in criminal statistics

&gt;By diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, a pedophile is an individual who fantasizes about, is sexually aroused by, or experiences sexual urges toward prepubescent children (generally &lt;13 years) for a period of at least 6 months. Pedophiles are either severely distressed by these sexual urges, experience interpersonal difficulties because of them, or act on them

See that important part there? Let me draw your attention to it

*a pedophile is an individual who fantasizes about, is sexually aroused by, or experiences sexual urges toward prepubescent children (generally &lt;13 years) for a period of at least 6 months. Pedophiles are either severely distressed by these sexual urges, experience interpersonal difficulties because of them, or act on them*

What you mean is this bit

&gt;Technically, individuals who engage in sexual activities with pubescent teenagers under the legal age of consent (ages 13—16 years) are known as hebophiles (attracted to females) or ephebophiles (attracted to males)

&gt;The term hebophilia (also spelled as hebephilia) is becoming a generic term to describe sexual interest in either male or female pubescent children

&gt;Distinctions noted in the literature between hebophiles and pedophiles are that hebophiles tend to be more interested in having reciprocal sexual affairs or relationships with children, are more opportunistic when engaging in sexual acts, have better social functioning, and have a better posttreatment prognosis than pedophiles

&gt;The term teleiophile applies to an adult who prefers physically mature partners

These are the sick ones

&gt;There is also a subclassification of pedophilia known as infantophilia, which describes individuals interested in children younger than 5 years

In part it is complicated because the ""NHS"" is actually 4 totally separate ""corporations"" - NHS England, NHS Wales and NHS Scotland. (Ireland has something called HSCNI). The next problem is that a lot of NHS employers are paid or staffed indirectly - such as via 3rd parties, including everything from temp/locum agencies all the way to entirely outsourced services. For example, most hospitals outsource their domestic and support services to 3rd party companies like [Medirest](http://www.medirest.co.uk). 

If you ignore this, then you can *sort of* conflate the NHS into the 5th largest employer in the world. But it's not really true.... although it is certainly fair to say a very large number of people **within** the UK work under the **NHS Brand**. 

It's also why politically doing things that make you **[unpopular with the NHS](http://www.conservatives.com/)** runs the risk of alienating a very large number of the voting age adults and their associated families in one fell swoop.

That was when he switched his tactics. CFC did a much better job of explaining it, but basically, AVB had set up a high line that would limit the room the opposition had to work with. Barcelona did this and he kinda did this at Porto but it requires a DM that can quickly transition the ball from defense to offense so that once you stiffle the oppositions attack, you engage a endless barrage of attacks. Unfortunately, he didn't get his deep laying play maker (Moutinho) and what ended up happening was not only did we limit the room the opposition had to work with, but we limited the room our team had to work with once we got into the opponents box. That's why, despite us dominating possesion and getting all those shots off, we were forced to take them in none dangerous areas.

So his plan worked half way, it achieved the strong defense it was supposed to achieve. But without that key role, it made us look boring and not scoring any goals. So he threw this (somewhat) working formula out the window, and started experimenting with more attacking formations. Remember when he was fielding Defoe and Soldado? 

By the time the Liverpool game came, our formation, game plan, and tactics didn't bear any resemblance to what we were doing at the beginning of the season. I'm guessing AVB just panicked when we weren't scoring goals. Such a shame because I think with the way Adebayor, Chadli, Eriksen and Bentaleb are playing, he might have had the pieces he needed to make his vision come true.

He's a leader on the pitch, watch any game where Gerrard isn't around and see him organise the defenders at set-pieces. He also has a vision for distributing the ball and likes to get forward when possible. He reminds me very much of the Gerrard of years gone by. 

I suspect he'll be the next captain and I imagine him being a dead-cert for a CM position for the rest of his Liverpool career. Obviously he's not the same world-class, fully-rounded player Gerrard was 7 or so years ago, but Henderson is industrious and talented enough to fill the same role. 

He'll just have to rely on other players giving as much as he does, while Gerrard would carry the team on his own at times.

But being objective about it, we here in the UK are basically going to follow every law we have to either way.

My personal view is that I trust the EU to make laws far more than I do the UK anyway.

Johnson and Flanagan bombing down the wings, overlapping (see Kaboul's OG), allowing for Sterling and Coutinho to be dynamic (either stay wide/cut inside/drift into middle). gerrard staying in that role just in front of the defensive line looking to keep possession, and when the opportunity presents itself, send long balls out to wings/forwards to start a quick attack.

*Notes:*

Can't see Johnson being a part of the first team the season after next, whether he's still at the club or not. Same with Skrtel, who will be 30/31 by then and I believe Rodgers will look for a younger CB to start developing a career-long partnership with Sakho. 

Flanagan will still be useful on either side. He may be first choice RB with a new LB taking the other spot, or he may have just developed into a predominantly left-sided fullback and we'll have a new RB.

Sterling will be one of the best players in the Prem by this stage. Henderson will be captain. We will bring in another CM such as Rakitic. We won't have anyone in the deep-lying role. Lucas will still be at the club but inevitably injured. Gerrard will be spending more time on the bench but when he does play, he'll revert to his role we've seen him play this season.

Suarez will still be at the club despite a world record bid coming in for him at some point between now and then.

He looked lost when he did against Man U, he again looked lost yesterday. He is just not a striker. Torres, while absolutely shit in the league, he has played well in CL matches. If not Torres, then Ba. 

Anyone with a pulse would have noticed that the team that came out in the second half was flat. Even Hazard who was fantastic in the first half, came out tired and lazy.

If the communist regime was good for something, it was infrastructure and most of it was built in the communist age (anther example would be Romania's massive railway network).             
           
What happened is that the big national telecoms started upgrading their infrastructure to FTTB/H in order to compete with the smaller local ISPs called ""Neighborhood Networks"" which cropped up everywhere and offered relatively cheap and high speed internet. They usually bought 100 Mbps or more dedicated speeds then that was shared between the members of that network. When I used to live in Bucharest in 2007, I was paying 4£ for 100 Mbps (which was more like 50 Mbps at night when there was high congestion, but overall it was quite speedy internet).                
If I were to point at something that helped the Internet speeds boom in Romania it would be the unregulated free market we had. Nowadays there are metropolitan networks and how ISPs lay down cables is regulated to avoid ugly cables everywhere, but it's still pretty much an open market. If you and a couple of your mates who live in the same area want to start your own ISP, no problem, just pool your cash, register a company, and then buy a couple 1 to 10 Gbps lines from one of the upper level providers.

true,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,"&gt; But being objective about it, we here in the UK are basically going to follow every law we have to either way. And that is why it's philosophical - it doesn't matter who or which companies are concerned. The only difference is how we justify following these rules to ourselves.

Outside of the EU the ""laws"" wouldn't be laws, they'd be standards. There is nothing that says the UK would have to impose these standards and it would be up to the individual companies to do so should they wish to trade with the EU (or anywhere else in the world) that has such standards.

&gt; My personal view is that I trust the EU to make laws far more than I do the UK anyway... but are they really bad reasons?

Yes, I am afraid they are bad reasons. First and foremost, the UK version of democracy, English Common Law, is one of the most successful models in the world, unlike Napoleonic law. Basically everyone is free to do whatever they want that isn't specifically prohibited, in other words there is a presumption of freedom. Most of our European partners have differing approaches to democracy i.e. that people are only allowed to do what the state specifies they are allowed to do. In other words, the opposite of English Common Law's presumption of freedom. This is in part why EU legislation requires so much and meshes so poorly with existing UK law (and before any pedants go on about Scottish Law and Northern Irish Law being different, yes they are, but they still spring from the same fount and have the same presumption towards freedom).

With regards to representation of the people, again the UK is more of a shining beacon than example of what not to do. Our biggest democratic deficit is the West Lothian question which only exists because regional assemblies have devolved powers. Our elections are some of the cleanest in the world (this in spite of postal voting and mass immigration from cultures where vote fraud is the norm). We have elections frequently and independents stand and sometimes win seats. Furthermore the monopoly of the big three is under serious threat from UKIP right now, showing that Britons not only care about representation but are prepared to vote for it in numbers if they feel they aren't represented.

On rights and privacy, the UK is singled out like Israel is in the Middle East for its shortcomings because these shortcomings are so apparent against the standards by which they are judged. In the UK people like Rebecca Brooks and Andy Coulson are on trial. In most other EU states they'd be protected from prosecution. As for rights, look at the seriousness which was given to the debate on 28 day detention. Most of our EU partners have indefinite detention before charge because they operate on a different legal system that is massively less focused on the rights of the individual. Even if the UK scraps the Human Rights Act UK citizens would still have all the protections that existed prior, which in practice far outweigh the treatment of citizens of most other EU countries.

As for trying to force countries like Romania to step in line with the civilized world, I'd much prefer an approach that encourages rather than forcing. Incentivising with carrot and stick rather than just stick.

&gt; I don't really like the idea of our idiotic government and possibly even more idiotic electorate being in completely charge of my future.

Do you realise that following the logical conclusion of your thoughts through you arrive at authoritarianism? With the greatest of respect, I find your analysis simplistic, your understanding of things naive and your conclusions utterly wrong, but I would never, NEVER countenance you not having a voice and a say in your future. But having lived and worked in Brussels I've seen first hand how your mindset is shared by many others who are paving the road to Hell with their good intentions. 

I've gone on longer than I meant to, but I think it's important to say these things as so many EU-philes seem not to be aware of them or to appreciate the seriousness these issues represent.

HMRC is currently moving desktops to Win 7 and laptops to Win 8.

I don't recall what the total rollout timescale was, but it runs most of this year.

The desktop PCs are having to be upgraded to actually run Win 7, which adds to the cost.  It can't just be installed over the network onto the same machines.

A major sticking point has apparently been that there were issues getting a lot of internally developed applications to run on anything more recent than IE6.  *(Seriously!)*

The underlying problem is that most everything is outsourced and it's well known that everything done through the outsourced contracts is horrendously overpriced.  *(There was an inquiry into this a couple of years ago that concluded the Civil Service was paying up to ten times the market rate.)*

Gaining admission to the standard five-year courses means you are entitled to receive student loans from Student Finance England for maintenance and tuition fees in the first four years.

From year five onwards, tuition fees will be paid by the NHS Student Bursary Scheme and you will be eligible to apply for a means-tested NHS bursary to cover maintenance costs and a reduced maintenance loan from Student Finance England.

Students starting from September 2012 will also have access to a non-means tested grant of £1,000 as part of their NHS Bursary award.

These funding arrangements will continue to apply if you are starting your studies in academic years 2012/13 to 2014/15 (universities can charge up to a maximum of £9,000 in tuition fees in 2012/13).

However, the arrangements for graduate medical students on a five year course are different. In the first four years of the course, they would not be eligible to receive a loan for tuition fees or a maintenance grant regardless of whether or not they have previously received funding. However, students may be able to apply for a full, income based, maintenance loan from Student Finance England. From year five of the training, graduate medical students receive the same support as undergraduate medical students (see above).

Then you have industrial revolution and the rise Unitarian and Methodists who move further away from it. By the end of the second world war religion and a lot of its traditions are on the wane as we all become capitalist consumers in the super charged American tradition

St Patrick day, its first recorded parade in the modern sense, was in Boston in the USA back in the 18th century. I guess a bunch of homesick Irish people wanted to have a bit of fun. Ironically many of the early St Patrick day parades were about temperance and restraint, not alcoholic mash up. 

And think about, so many Irish descendants in america, not to metion Britain, want to celebrate this Irishness and with the capitalist tradition, a company like Guinness is onto a money making wet dream!!

St Patrick day is just marketed as a day to get pissed, it about making money its got very little to do with irishness, or its original catholic feast day. To me, well where I grew up and when, celebrating St Georges day didn't really matter.  

Some people worry because it seems the perceived growth in celebrating St Georges day  has come from a reactionary sentiment within the working class of "" if they [ethnic minorities] get their holidays why can't we celebrate ours?"" which has the potential to turn a sense of patriotism into a darker sense of intolerance or narrowing of definitions of peoples identities creating a harsher them and us mind set. 

But there is a historical and social reason within the English themselves as to why St Georges day is not as mass celebrated holiday. And capitalist consumerism has long since lassoed St Patrick day into a day where drinks, brewery, pub and green dye companies can make money. I hope there is someone out there who can explain why it is like a 2hr BBC 4 documentary

Issues that are not directly related to the software's core functionality are frequently put on the back burner or even totally ignored.

Result: almost all business software suffers from at least one - frequently many - of the following issues:

 - Requires its own separate authentication (username and password) system and doesn't integrate with anything else. (This is how you wind up with a hundred different passwords to remember).
   - For extra comedy value, have the application run wholly and exclusively on Windows. Not only do you have an authentication system built right into Windows, it's actually easier to use this than roll your own.
 - Is expected to be installed on a couple of hundred PCs yet goes out of its way to make this process difficult. I can't think of anything I should like less than visit a hundred PCs and double-click on setup.exe, which is why there are dozens of ways to ensure I don't have to.
   - For bonus points, write the product so it doesn't make automating the installation difficult. It makes it impossible.
 - Is nominally web-based but requires the installation of four separate ActiveX controls, at least two of which can only be installed by visiting a website and require admin rights to function.
 - Requires admin rights to run despite doing nothing special that should require such rights.

They're not good for providing a base load of power because of the unpredictablity -  wind thresholds can go up and down hugely day by day as an example. Onshore wind is nowhere near as good as offshore but that costs much much more to build for obvious reasons Tidal power is better because of this, but again, you still have still water periods, and they can cause damage to ecosystems as they currently stand. If we want to reduce CO2 emissions quickly and in a way that meets our international obligations, we can't do it without investing strongly in Nuclear now, and in a big way because of the time it takes to build plants. As it stands the Government isn't currently doing that - they're trying to get private companies to put the money in which just isn't going to be fast enough. So really, the government ISN'T committed to Nuclear in any meaningful way. Also, the strike price deal to try and get private companies to build power stations is likely to be ruled illegal under EU law but currently there isn't a plan B. It's a real mess. 

Some interesting reads:

https://www.raeng.org.uk/news/publications/list/reports/Nuclear_Energy.pdf

We're also closing a lot of our coal power stations by 2015, and they need to be replaced by something, and quickly. I think this will have to be met by renewables but as it stands it could lead us to an energy crisis in 10-15 years where we actually might have blackouts.

I do think English Common Law is a better basis for law, I would not argue with that. But this doesn't stop any current government from imposing absolutely anything that overrules any specific freedom that we might have (or have had). So the issue I have with government unfortunately makes our superior basis of law irrelevant.

I am definitely not authoritarian, and would indeed fire that one right back at you - what's the point of having freedom by default when you have an authoritarian government who will happily overrule any freedoms without a second thought? Let's take cannabis as a popular example. Without public support, without scientific support, without consultation, without referendum, we just get laws made for us like this that are not democratically grounded.

Regarding representation, I am referring more to the old FPTP vs. PR chestnut. Obviously the system of law and government once elected has no direct relation to the way they are elected. I simply cannot and will not ever be able to reconcile the way we elect government. This is one of the major reasons I would take a European government over our own. Even if more flawed by other metrics, a better representation of the people is preferred and has a lot of weight to it when all things are considered.

But sure we can cherry pick examples from the EU like you did and the UK like I did.

&gt;

&gt;__Burnley Savings and Loans Limited__ trading under the slogan __""Bank on Dave!""__ is an independent lending scheme based in [Burnley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnley), United Kingdom founded by David Fishwick, a successful [minibus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minibus) retailer, in September 2011. It aims to offer 5% [AER](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_interest_rate) on savings and to [lend](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan) to local businesses at 8.9% to 14.9%, with no [bonuses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance-related_pay) for the staff of three. The company also wishes to be separate from regular [high street banks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail_banking).  

&gt;It was set up in 2011 by Dave Fishwick, who felt that the current [banking system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banking_in_the_United_Kingdom) was corrupt and needed change; he felt they weren't lending enough money to people or small businesses that needed a kick-start to get going, and that the rate of [interest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest) for savings was too low. As such, Fishwick decided to use an above-market 5% AER. All profits after overheads are given directly to charity.  The business does not [credit score](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating) but does visit every person or small business applying for the loan to see if it is needed, instead of doing it all on the paperwork.  In July 2012 it was reported that two percent of loans were in [arrears](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrears). 

&gt;There was trouble persuading the [Financial Services Authority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Services_Authority) to grant Fishwick a banking licence and name it an actual bank.  An [e-petition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_petition) to the [UK Government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom) appealing the failure to obtain a banking licence was unsuccessful.  The naming found a loophole as Bank *on* Dave, officially an advertising slogan. He found premises in Burnley and it officially opened to the public with a [ribbon-cutting ceremony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribbon-cutting_ceremony) with comedian [Ted Robbins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Robbins) in September 2011. Allegedly, the key to the safe was previously kept behind a bottle of cherryade in a cupboard.  Fishwick himself personally guarantees all money customers put in. The company has now reached its target of lending £25,000 a week and has a waiting list of new customers.

An example for Spurs might be that if things are going well, the defence might make the obvious decision to drop deeper because they already know their high-line is a problem.

true,djhworld,uk,London/Nottingham,"&gt; The UK government doesn't exactly have money to spare. Upgrading an OS on a government scale is a major project with (probably) a 9-figure price tag.

The 9 figure price tag stems from the fact that the civil service tend to favour big monoliths like Atos, Accenture, IBM and Fujitsu to take on these projects at a huge cost that usually fails to deliver.

I'm not saying the project won't be complex, as it will be, but I have a certain suspicion that these giants are big drains for public cash.

&gt;

&gt;An __oligopoly__ is a [market form](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_form) in which a [market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market) or [industry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry) is dominated by a small number of sellers (oligopolists). Oligopolies can result from various forms of collusion which reduce competition and lead to higher prices for consumers. 

&gt;With few sellers, each oligopolist is likely to be aware of the actions of the others. The decisions of one firm therefore influence and are influenced by the decisions of other firms. [*[citation needed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] [Strategic planning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_planning) by oligopolists needs to take into account the likely responses of the other market participants. [*[citation needed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt; The UK's libel laws are horrific and in serious need of reform.

They have been reformed; a new law came in in January this year. To quote s.2 of the Defamation Act:

&gt;(1) It is a defence to an action for defamation for the defendant to show that the imputation conveyed by the statement complained of is substantially true.

&gt;(2) Subsection (3) applies in an action for defamation if the statement complained of conveys two or more distinct imputations.

&gt;(3) If one or more of the imputations is not shown to be substantially true, the defence under this section does not fail if, having regard to the imputations which are shown to be substantially true, the imputations which are not shown to be substantially true do not seriously harm the claimant's reputation.

All the book needs to be is substantially true (not totally in every detail) and even if it's not true it must be shown that their reputations were harmed (which to be fair they probably would be). I don't doubt the truth of the material but the publisher is protected by the law provided the book is true. They are simply cowards as far as I can see it and I don't understand their position. They are probably scared of Russian oligarchs with lost of money to spend on lawyers but they shouldn't be.
