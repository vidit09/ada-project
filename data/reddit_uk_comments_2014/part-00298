Even think about his interactions with the little girl. Saying she isn't special.

 Comparing that to 11th quote ""Nobody important? Blimey, that's amazing. You know that in nine hundred years of time and space and I've never met anybody who wasn't important before.""

This doctor and the previous doctors we have met. 11 and 10.  They are night and day. 

I do agree that 12 was full of shit here though. I can see the previous doctors putting pressure on Clara to make a decision but not in the same method that 12 used. He just left and said he would be back. I don't feel like 11 or 10 would do that. I'm sure they would have emphasized the importance of the decision. Of life and the effects it could have on the future, even just a single alien popping up in the sky and the wonder of it.  And if push came to shove he wouldn't let them detonate the bombs. He has been trying to help guide humanity on a good path in the past. Why would now be any different? well it's not the previous doctors. He may be the doctor at the core, but he is also quite a different man at the same time. 

But I could be wrong. Speculating like that is almost the realm of fan-fiction. And I can't write doctor who worth a damn.

But this doctor. He isn't a ""hero"" or ""a good wizard"" he is a Timelord. That is what this episode seems to be getting at to me. That is the feel that I got form him. From how he has described Timelords in the past. This doctor feels more like a Timelord then the previous ones.

... 

&gt; Similarly, a study (2000) conducted by economic experts Claudia Goldin from Harvard University and Cecilia Rouse from Princeton University shows that when evaluators of applicants could see the applicant’s gender they were more likely to select men. When the applicants gender could not be observed, the number of women hired significantly increased.[69][70] David Neumark, a Professor of Economics at the University of California, Irvine, and colleagues (1996) found statistically significant evidence of sex discrimination against women in hiring. In an audit study, matched pairs of male and female pseudo-job seekers were given identical résumés and sent to apply for jobs as waiters and waitresses at the same set of restaurants. In high priced restaurants, a female applicant’s probability of getting an interview was 35 percentage points lower than a male’s and her probability of getting a job offer was 40 percentage points lower. Additional evidence suggests that customer biases in favor of men partly underlie the hiring discrimination. According to Neumark, these hiring patterns appear to have implications for sex differences in earnings, as informal survey evidence indicates that earnings are higher in high-price restaurants.[58]

Frankly you see it most in this context. It describes a person who is looking to pick a fight about something. They WANT to be offended and go out of their way to find something they think might be wrong and pick a fight. 


It's usually associated with feminism because well one there are just less MRA's.

and two these sort of people tend to use a jab and retreat tactic and feminism is a great shield.

What I mean by that is they will say something, lets use the comment in question as an example.

Lets pretend the person who said it was just some random person and not Niel Gaiman.

So they say there should be more female writers on doctor who. Lets also say you disagree with that. you say something like ""Well they should just hire better writers. If the best writer is a woman fine but if it isn't they they should hire the best person""

someone who is a SJW now will ""jab and retreat"" 

The ""jab""

""Obviously you hate women you misogynistic shitlord. "" (i may be going a bit too far here right off the bat but, you know making a point)

Now you are no longer talking about doctor who. You are now on the defensive. Now you are defending yourself against feminism. If you don't agree with what this SJW said you hate women, and feminism. 

And feminism is the retreat in this instance. They made their point, attacked you, and retreated into the shield of feminism. 

Now that it has been established this is about feminism and how mofatt and doctorwho fans hate women now this SJW has a fight to rally others around to the cause. Doctorwho in this case is now anti woman and anti feminist. Weather this makes any sense at all doesn't matter. Because doctor who hasn't had a female writer since 2008 when Mofatt took over. and AMY had the least amount of lines a companion has had in her run (and lets ignore the fact she was sharing the spotlight with Rory)

Again this is an approximation and possibly an over simplification of how I understand things. I can't really say for sure I am correct but this is sort of what it seems like to me.

Were you attacked yourself mate? Is it that specific incident I mention?

There was another one I heard about too, where there was a group of the Ajax firm lurking around the Red Light District, and they rushed some blues in a separate incident.

I was walking to the RLD and a group of middle aged Dutch men approached me asking me where I was from, I immediately got the impression they were going to kick my head in if I told them I was from Manchester, so I played it cool and told them I was from Birmingham and asked for directions to the RLD.

Fucking nuts. Lone guy on his own as well. Cowardly shithouses.

But that's the attitude of many other football fans in mainland Europe towards travelling football fans from England captured in microcosm.

I ended up watching the game on my own in some random pub full of average Ajax fans, kept a fairly low profile and spoke to some random Dutch lad in his late teens or early twenties. He was sound, but openly expressed his admiration for England's hooligan culture (he was dressed like an extra from the football factory, thought it was a bit cringeworthy in all honesty). But he was alright, then his mates bounced in, found out I was a City fan and spent the next hour or so giving me grief about it.

One of them in particular was trying to get in my face, but failed quite miserably with his attempts at intimidation.

But I still had to watch that game with several of those daft cunts celebrating in my face as we threw away a goal lead and lost 3-1.

Was alright though to be fair, might have ended up in a scrap if we'd won it!

Sad though really, but that's the hangover of the English hooligan reputation. Thing is, over here firms make distinctions between plain old supporters and other firms. As a travelling fan in Europe, it doesn't matter whether or not you're in a firm or not, you're fair game.

Tricia Sullivan has won an Aurthur C Clarke award, so maybe hire her, but she has no TV writing credits.
Sally Malcolm only ever wrote Stargate novels before 2012, no TV credits.

Six or so years ago I set off the alarm when I walked *in* to a large Tesco in London. Nobody asked me to stop, or even looked at me twice.

I put some stuff in my basket, paid for it, walked out, and set off the alarm again. This time a security guard came out after me, and demanded that I stop. I kept walking, and told him that I wouldn't stop. There was some to-ing and fro-ing, and he radioed for another guard to join him. Now confronted with two men, I stopped briefly, pointed out the receipt on the top of my bag, and explained that I wasn't going to let them go through my bags. Then the guards decided to give up.

The alarm definitely went off, I set it off. There were two of them, and they probably could have physically detained me if they chose to do so. AFAICT, they chose not to detain me, because they knew they were on very flimsy legal ground. The word ""theft"" was bandied around, but I assume they didn't want to take the risk, as they knew that the alarm itself wasn't sufficient evidence, so they needed my consent for any searches.

Her initial reactions were very interesting.

""The walls are painted,"" she said. ""I mean, really painted - not with bits peeling off everywhere. It looks like they painted it more recently than ten years ago, and have repaired it since.""

She has also noted that the library is amazing, the other facilities appear to be beyond her wildest dreams, and the standard of lecturing has changed her mind about higher education being a chore that one has to slog through on the way to a career. She went as far as to go up to and personally thank a lecturer after she gave her first talk of the term, telling her: ""thank you for showing that learning can be inspiring and fun!""

She came home that night positively glowing.

Being a foreign student, she had to pay the full £9,000 whack in fees. She tells me (initial thoughts - the course only just  started) that she definitely made the right choice, and is happily recommending a Masters in England to her German friends. This despite the course being only a year long, and thus not qualifying her to do a PhD in Germany without topping it up with a German qualification later (or so her University in Germany told her). But she's already talking about doing a PhD in London (and paying for it) rather than returning to Germany to do it -  which was a strong contender in the possibilities last month.

Now I stand against the fees, myself. I don't think they have led to an increase in quality here. I think they are unfair and unnecessary. But let's not be too hasty in basing our model on the German one by measuring a small subset of the metrics.


**EDIT** bonus info for more balance: she's a mature student in her 30s, who got a job after school, and then studied hard to get into the German university in the first place. Without the German government student loans (which includes, by the way, enough to pay the whole of the £9,000 fees plus enough to get by on every month) she would not have been able to get her degree in Germany *or* study here.",0,1412751128,null,0,1412751503,0,cl3l0ma,t3_2ik4fn,t1_cl3l0ma,t3_2ik4fn,null,1426630377,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I think he has a decent history of carefully building squads at Everton, keeping an eye on the future as well as the present. However QPR is somewhat of a stepdown from both Man Yoo and Everton so he might not be all that suitable. He'd have to recreate his Preston mindset, albeit with a little more financial elbow. Who knows what kind of ego damage the man suffered at Old Trafford too? Plus financially he never has to work again with his payoff.

I don't think Rio would be too pleased to see him, and we can't be upsetting him now, can we?

I'd happily take McLaren too.

I'm implying a woman has a different perspective on the world based on how she's treated, and that different perspective create diverse stories, which are more interesting than non-diverse stories. That's not sexism, and it's pretty insulting to actual sexism that you're calling it that.

&gt;  If you can make a statement about a woman, then switch the gender of the subject, and the statement becomes universally recognized as being sexist, the original statement is sexist as well.

""Men have been unfairly persecuted by women for millenium."" 

Yep that's a sexist thing to say.

""Women have been unfairly persecuted by men for millenium.""

Nope, not sexist. 

Not sure your theory works there buddy. 

&gt; Gender equality is about giving people a fair chance regardless of the person's gender. It is NOT giving one gender an unfair advantage over the other just because the position has traditionally been held by a different gender.

You're implying women have a fair chance. If they do, I have to question why they've only had 3 women writers over 50 years (only one of whom was in the last10).

&gt;

&gt;__Ursula Kroeber Le Guin__ (US /ˈɜrsələ ˈkroʊbər ləˈɡwɪn/;  born October 21, 1929) is an [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_people) author of novels, children's books, and short stories, mainly in the genres of [fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy) and [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction). She has also written poetry and essays. First published in the 1960s, her work has often depicted futuristic or imaginary alternative worlds in politics, natural environment, gender, religion, sexuality and ethnography.

&gt;Le Guin was influenced by fantasy writers including [J. R. R. Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien), by science fiction writers including [Philip K. Dick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick) (who was in her same high school class, though they didn't know one another), by central figures of Western literature such as [Leo Tolstoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy), [Virgil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil) and the [Brontë sisters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bront%C3%AB_sisters), by feminist writers such as [Virginia Woolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Woolf), by children's literature such as *[Alice in Wonderland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland)*, *[The Wind in the Willows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_in_the_Willows)*, *[The Jungle Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle_Book)*, by [Norse mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology), and by books from the [Eastern tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_tradition) such as the *[Tao Te Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching)*.      In turn, she influenced such [Booker Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booker_Prize) winners and other writers, as [Salman Rushdie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Rushdie) and [David Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mitchell_(author\)) – and notable futurism and fantasy writers including [Neil Gaiman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman) and [Iain Banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Banks).  She has won the [Hugo Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award), [Nebula Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula_Award), [Locus Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_Award_for_Best_Novel), and [World Fantasy Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Fantasy_Award), each more than once.

Like I was saying. This doctor is more like a timelord. At least that is the roll he's taken in this episode. He wanted humanity to makes it's decision without him. To decide their own future. That's not, not giving a shit, that's ""time to make a grown up decision"". Taking off the kid gloves with humanity.

It's a huge change. And it's likely because I THINK they are trying to make him closer to the first doctor. Though I haven't seen much beyond the first episode of him so I can't say for sure. So it's a huge change from what we have seen with little evolution and it is bad story telling. 

Frankly I don't like 12. The way he has been written. He's not the kind of character I really like much. So far I rate this a lot like I rate the Television movie. The writing is lacking, but the actor playing the doctor is fantastic. Only difference is I did like the way 8 was written, just not the script. I've been trying to figure out if the reason why I don't like the way 12 is, is because I'm suffering from ""regeneration grieving"" or not. I'm not quite sure, so I've been trying to hold off on forming a real opinion on him. But just from what I've seen it's too much of a leap from where we have been to where we are now.

Getting beaten 8-1 by Middlesbrough in May 2008.

It was the last day of the season and it was a beautiful day in Manchester. The sun was out, and there was that warm glow and anticipation of the beginning of summer among us Vitamin D deprived Mancs. We boarded our coach in excitement of a good day out getting behind the blues. Most people were decked out in t-shirts, some even in shorts.

After a couple of hours or so we neared Middlesbrough, and the police boarded the coach after we stopped at a service station. They gave this PC plod speech about alcohol, and searched the coach for beer. Came across as a bit totalitarian and unnecessary, and it set the tone for things to come.

The police then escorted us towards Middlesbrough in a convoy, and the sun disappeared.

When we got off the coach the temperature had almost halved, the sun had gone, and there was smog everywhere.

So, upon our welcome to this grey, smog ridden shithole we went through the turnstiles and then got a few beers in. The mood was good, and everyone was enjoying that end of season feel.

Then, the game started.

So we go to our seats, and myself and my mate notice an unusually large police presence to our left in a kind of utility corner of the stadium. There were dozens of police there, even a few police horses, peering over at us in the away end. I even noticed a plod recording us all with a digital camera. Was slightly odd, I recall thinking at the time.

The mood in the away end was good, there was a good natured mood about it, but also a defiant protest element over Thaksin's imminent sacking of Sven. Many a protest song were sung and there were a few SOS (Save Our Sven) banners.

The song was a classic too, I might add. To the tune of Pink Floyd's ABITW:

*We don't need no Phil Scolari, we don't need no Mourinho: Hey! Thaksin! 
Leave our Sven alone!*

But onto the game.

It was dire. Really dire.

We spent the opening few minutes mocking Stewart Downing, how he'd never play for England. Shortly after Richard Dunne tripped up Tuncay, IIRC, who was running to get on the receiving end of a diagonal ball - he would've been through on goal and the referee subsequently sent Dunnie off and gave the smoggies a penalty.

Downing took it and slotted it home.

The appetite of the players fell, and they lacked the bottle to fight with ten men. We went into the second half 2 nil down.

After half time we capitulated. Boro put pressure on us, and we fell to pieces. No-one had the appetite to fight for the cause, there were no leaders out on the pitch and we utterly collapsed. Boro scored everytime they went forward.

Downing scored a majestic volley with the outside of his left foot. Someone scored a worldy of a free kick from around 30 yards out which arrowed into the top corner.

Everything Boro tried came off spectacularly. Everything we did failed miserably.

After around the 4th or 5th goal, the away end became a carnival like atmosphere. We were not unfamiliar with drubbings, and we took a masochistic pleasure in our awfulness once one. We demonstrated our unrivalled support, and did what we always did best: self depreciating humour and unsurpassed loyalty.

We noticed Boro's cringeworthy goal music celebration they played over the tannoy following every goal. Boro fans would dance and sign along to it like some League One outfit, so we did the same.

We began celebrating their goals, and chanting we 'never win at home and we never win away' with gusto, while simultaneously singing that we were going to win 6-5 etc. The more we were drubbed, the more vocal we got. We out sang the Boro fans.

It might sound bizarre for some, but I've genuinely never been prouder to be a City fan. This was our fanbase in microcosm.

But in the midst of all this, I noticed every time Boro scored, the police would run across from the utility area in the corner of the stands, and form a human line in front of the away end. They would then briefly stand there, decked out with batons, facing the away end. I've never seen anything like this before (or since), and while I didn't pay that much attention to it at the time, it seemed particularly aggressive, almost as if they were seeking confrontation.

But nonetheless, the carnival atmosphere in the away end continued. After about the seventh goal the police stayed put. They ceased running back and forth and stayed where they were, facing the away end.

Not long after I noticed a growing group of blues doing a conga on the walkway in front of the stands, of which was flanked by the police forming the said human barrier - behind the already adequate barrier of railings and advertising hoardings behind the goal.

So, I suggested to my mate that we go down and join them. And join them we did.

Picture the scene: City being beaten 7-0, and a few dozen blues gathered on the walkway behind the pitch doing a conga as if they were on some kind of holiday resort in Benidorm - there was even a guy dressed as a banana among us.

Shortly after, the walkway became much more crowded, and we simply proceeded to watch the rest of the game from there.

What followed, was pretty fucking reprehensible.

Elano had come on as a substitute, and shortly afterwards he scored a consolation goal with a majestic solo effort. We all began celebrating it as if we won the league. All in good nature and a bit tongue in cheek.

A matter of seconds later I heard an indignant roar to my right.

The carnival atmosphere evaporated in the time it took one aggressive little pig to smash an elderly man over the head with his baton.

The walkway was really cramped at this stage and I looked across to see batons raining down on the blues a matter of several feet from me. I would learn later, that this was apparently the result of an old fella accidentally knocking off said pig's helmet while celebrating Elano's goal while pressed against the railing in the cramped walkway.

This old fella apparently collapsed and had a seizure.

What followed was a rage of which I've never experience before or since at the football.

I saw people trying to point out the pig in question, and I saw the police batoning people indiscriminately in the cramped walkway.

I saw people throwing punches at the police.

At that stage, I said to my pal it was probably best that we got out of the way. So we climbed up the first few rows adjacent to the walkway to avoid being battoned by a pig with a bloodlust, and to get a better view of what was going on.

Blues all over the stand had seen one of these pigs lash out and hit the old fella in question, and they were all raging at this cunt pointing him out. Broken chairs began raining down from the stands at the police, the blues on the walkway were still tussling with the police, and batons were still being liberally used. I saw an old fella lying prone on the ground with his head entirely busted open.

Boro scored an eighth during this, but no-one gave a shit, nor did the Boro fans. All the focus was on the away end.

Myself and my mate then watched this legless little old fella, run up to the police line and throw the tamest of pushes in the general direction of some policeman in the line. He got clobbered, and then three of the police dragged him over the barrier while his pretty distressed young son tried to intervene, and got piled on.

It was a pretty infuriating scene in all honesty. There were dads with kids on the walkway, trapped between violent little pigs and angry blues desperate for retribution. I recall seeing a little girl crying her eyes out.

It continued past the final whistle, and the announcer declared the day's other results over the tannoy while it was going on, including that United had won the league at Wigan with some gusto - to cheers from the Boro fans.

Myself and my mate then dropped back onto the walkway to get out of the stadium via the ground level exits, the police had brought the dogs with them at that stage and then they started rushing the remaining blues on the walkway with batons raised.

At which stage, a guy dressed as a banana rushed pass me, holding a massive bloody gash on his head.

We exited, scarcely believing what we'd just seen, into the dreary grey smog which had initially welcomed us, and jumped aboard our coach for the long journey back to civilisation.

What followed, was a police statement to the press demonising City fans. I recall them stating one officer had received an injury to his wrist (wonder how he got that? Probably sprained it cracking people's skulls with his baton), while making no reference to what had caused the incident. 

Instead, the implication was that the blues in the away end were merely violent scum, reacting badly to an embarrassing result on the pitch - which, as I've stated previously, couldn't have been further from the truth.

The M.E.N even ran a front page with the pictures of about 30 City fans the Cleveland police had given to them, a wanted list for all intents and purposes.

The M.E.N not long after had to release a public apology to the vast majority of the people's pictures it had published, as they'd done no wrong doing.

The police were never held accountable for their behaviour that day, which began with aggressive, draconian and totalitarian policing long before the incident in question ever transpired. If you ask anyone about that day who wasn't intimately involved, they'll tell you the party line that it was merely City fans spitting the dummy out at the poor result and behaving like violent reprobates.

Which couldn't be further from the truth, and that's one of the most frustrating things about the whole incident. The truth never got out. (1/2)...",0,1412753856,null,0,1412794503,0,cl3lm1e,t3_2il3i6,t1_cl3lm1e,t1_cl38zm7,null,1426630071,12,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,12

By definition, the LS funds are not ""in one basket"", they're globally diversified equity/bond portfolios.

They also automatically rebalance so you won't get asset allocation drift.

The main catch is that they're more expensive than an underlying set of different trackers.

One advantage for regular investment is that if, say, you're saving £100 per month in an ISA, and the platform will only allow a minimum of £50 per month per fund, you might struggle to get proper diversification across asset classes/geographies picking two funds.

There are advantages to spreading out the holdings in a non-pension/ISA portfolio, mostly surrounding tax and making use of CGT allowances. There is also potentially something to be said for taking a relaxed approach to rebalancing (as opposed to the daily rebalance on LS funds).

edit:

Also, you may find the LS funds used in pension may not be appropriate for ISA (if you have a shorter timeline, for example).

The whole sequence of events remains the most disgusting things I've ever seen at football.

I did a lot thinking after that match, and I was consumed with anger thinking about how I would've reacted had that elderly bloke initially batoned over the head, been my dad.

I can say with all sincerity, I would've instinctively gone at that pig with everything I had. And I wouldn't have stopped until he was unconscious. Which was an upsetting thought, because that would ruin my life, and all because some jumped up little cunt in a uniform thinks he can bestow violence on vulnerable members of the public because he's in a position of authority.

That day remains the worst example of police brutality I've ever seen, it still angers me thinking about it.

Thankfully things like that are very rare. I've since read a bit about Cleveland police, and they're regarded as one of the worst police forces in the UK, with a notoriously bad rep.

&gt;

&gt;___Jumping the shark___ is an [idiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiom) created by [Jon Hein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hein) that was used to describe the moment in the evolution of a television show when it begins a decline in quality, signaled by a particular scene, episode, or aspect of a show in which the writers use some type of ""gimmick"" in an attempt to keep viewers' interest. The phrase is based on a scene from a fifth-season episode of the [sitcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom) *[Happy Days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Days)* when the character [Fonzie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fonzie) jumps over a shark while on water-skis.   

&gt;The usage of ""jump the shark"" has subsequently broadened beyond television, indicating the moment when a brand, design, franchise or creative effort's evolution declines.

And the Doctor even comments on how strange it was that she didn't remember the Daleks. 

&gt; This is because the Dalek invasion of Earth — and presumably every other RTD-era alien encounter that made it onto the news — has been swallowed up by season five's cracks and forgotton by the human race.

That's nonsense. I don't necessarily mean you are wrong (you may or may not be), but whether that's the canonical answer or not it is a rubbish answer, nonsense on a plate with an extra helping of bullshit on the side. It's the mark of lazy writers. Oh yes, the earth has been attacked about 50 times in the last fifty years (Autons, three times, Sontarans poisoning the atmosphere, giant space ships falling from the sky, Cybermen, Daleks more times you can shake a stick at, Yeti, that nasty business with Torchwood and the children being stolen, and so on) but oh so conveniently ""nobody remembers"" *any of them*. Not one.

How is it that the Cracks only swallowed memory of the alien invasions, but not people's memories of (say) last years football results, or world war two, or who the Queen is?

If that's what Team Who are thinking, that's up there with ""...and then he woke up, it was all a dream"" for utter lameness. I actually hope you are wrong, because if you are right, Moffat and co are even worse at writing science fiction than I had feared.

I do think you are wrong. Danny jumped to the conclusion that the Doctor was an alien pretty damn quickly for somebody who didn't know about the existence of humanoid aliens. And Courtney too *immediately* suggested that the Doctor was an alien, as soon as she saw the inside of the TARDIS. Which is pretty weird, when you think about it. Why would you imagine that somebody who looked human was an alien unless you had been exposed to human-looking aliens?

Lol. I forgot the EU was a signatory to the Belfast Agreement, and the bit in it about the principal of consent was all a bit of a joke.

&gt;The British position to Northern Ireland has always been one of decoupling political links with it surreptitiously over time without adding fuel to Unionist suspicions. 

*Dougal-real-life.jpg*

&gt;A recent example is Cameron's commitment to devolving more powers to the northern assembly which nationalist parties welcomed but the unionist ones didn't.

That is not the reason behind further devolution lol. Does Cameron also want to get rid of Scotland? 'Surreptitiously'?

&gt;They used to say that the south of Ireland would never have a say in the running of the North. It's now constitutionally linked to the UK via Northern Ireland and it'll only get stronger on the path to Irish unity. Expect Joint sovereignty to be the next phase of that journey.

Under your definition, yes it's sexist. But your definition is vague and general enough to be useless. It ignores all the existing biases and the unfairness of the system that's already built in. 

By your logic, it's racist to create scholarships for black youths. But that's ignoring the fact that black people are more in need of those scholarships than white people. Black people are disproportionately poor, unrepresented in politics or upper management positions, and are both more likely to be victims of crime and face harsher sentences for equivalent crimes than white people. Treating everyone the same under all circumstances isn't a solution to prejudice, that ignores the fact that the starting position isn't equal yet. 

Most showrunners are men. Most network producers are men. Both of them grew up in times where men were viewed as smarter, more dynamic and more important then women. They may have a bias towards stories about men written by men. This doesn't mesh with the fact that a large percentage of the Doctor Who audience are women, who may like stories written from a women's perspective. If the goal is for the show to generate episodes for it's fans to enjoy, it needs variety. Variety that might not be represented in the tastes of the overwhelmingly male show runners and producers. That's why they should consciously go outside their own tastes to create content for their audience. 

&gt; It's a basic anti-bias technique that removes sex from the decision making process and ensures a selection based on merit.

Muddled and confused, it drags along and there always seems to be a little nod towards the previous Doctor. It feels like the Smith fans have separation anxiety, despite regeneration being a central theme in the show since day one. That aside, I suspect they maybe need some time to figure out where they're going with Capaldi. I want to like his stories. I really do, but they're bloody terrible.

My personal gripe largely has to do a lot with Clara stealing the show. I can't stand watching her complain, yell at, and even physically accost the Doctor. It grates on my nerves and it feels like she's a second rate and marginally more violent version of Amy Pond. There's no scene she can't ruin with her screeching.

I want to like this series. I really do, but the writing has been bad. Really bad. To me it feels like there's no sense of direction. They keep hinting at the existence of a metaplot with Missy but there's nothing to connect the dots after seven episodes already. I'm dangerously close to losing interest altogether.

That being said, I think Listen was the biggest steaming pile of the season yet. It had potential, especially after the whole debacle with the Silence editing themselves out of memory. Monsters under the bed of every sentient being? Yes, please! Oh wait.. it's just some ridiculous primal memory of.. Clara? Ruined. Ugh.

The recent episode with the moon was a little silly with the egg thing but I enjoyed it more on the level that the Doctor just decided to bugger off. Oh, you all think you know better? Fine. Let's put an end to all this companion jackassery. Give the man a companion, not a nanny. Hell, give him more! The one companion per Doctor thing is getting a little boring. Previous Doctors had more than one. They were interesting! They had history! They weren't all winners, but at least we had something to latch onto. Amy, Clara.. they're all just the same boring cardboard cutout. At least Rose developed over the course of her run.

You are allowed your opinion but the fact your nice and cozy in england makes it all the more ironic. You also are English why don't you improve england? Because it seems to me you are very interested on why you seem to think your heritage means you have a higher opinion than people who live here. Your just as bad as the ulster unionists who scream ""am Scottish"" cause there great grandfather came from Scotland. You are English it doesn't matter where your family is from you are an English guy who tries to stir the pot, who only goes on here to hear the smugness in his voice. You make fantastic points well..from what you read on Wikipedia.

It damn well matters where you are from. Best people to talk about  Scotlands issues are the people in Scotland. Best people to talk about wales issues are the people who live in wales. Best people to talk about Englands issues are the people who live in England. It matters a awful lot because you never have to face the issues that this assembly gives us. You see this as a internet game and point scoring contest. It damn well hurts the points of other nationalist leaning redditors. They make an argument about how unionists would be welcome in a United ireland. Then to their shock a English lad  (you) comes in and screams ""unionists are low uneducated scum"" and they have to explain you don't even live here.

You may even believe what you say but it all seems to me your a bored english person who goes on Wikipedia and says ""well golly gee! Time I paid those degenerates at /r/northernireland a vist and show them how smart I am! Im so down with the people!""

I don't give a damn about your comment  what I give a damn is that you have this nice utopia in your head in a United  Ireland happening  and if it goes crap then you can sit nice in your home in England and laugh at the people being effected.

Every day more you sound like /u/dontthrowstones. You can be right about unionist parties hell I agree what I don't agree on is you trying to  influence people's politics. Go and sort out Westminster if your so politically attuned. Leave northern ireland to be sorted out by the people who live here. But oh of course your great great grandfather living here means you can make that call. What a joke.

This Dan Harmon quote sums up my thoughts. It's about comedy writing but I think it equally applies to the boys' club mentality of mainstream sci-fi.

&gt;They’re harder to find. It’s definitely not because women ain’t funny, because I’m finding the opposite. It’s because there’s fewer of them. The statistical probability of picking up a shitty script, it’s compounded for women. There’s the same percentage of genius happening in both genders, but there’s less women writing scripts and out there looking for the job. So you dig a little extra-hard, and you end up with a staff that took a few extra meetings and a few extra shitty scripts to read. Now you have a staff that is just as good as the staff you would have had, but happens to be half women. And it seems like the greatest thing in the world, because the world is half women. And the male writers across the board, from top to bottom, in their most private moments drinking with me, when they’re fully licensed to be as misogynist, reactive, old-boy-network as they want, all they can say is, “This turned out to be a great thing.” 

&gt;The energy is different. It doesn’t keep anybody polite. We’re not doffing our caps or standing up when they enter the room. They do more dick jokes than anybody, because they’ve had to survive, they have to prove, coming in the door, that they’re not dainty. That’s not fair, but women writers, they acquire the muscle of going blue fast because they have to counter the stigma. I don’t have enough control groups to compare it to, but there’s just something nice about feeling like your writers’ room represents your ensemble a little more accurately, represents the way the world turns.

false,TechJesus,null,null,"&gt; I’m no believer in total redistribution of wealth, that would be the other extreme and both extremes are wrong – I know you’d agree with the latter case and hoped you would in the former, though you declined to answer. It’s not controversial to state that there has been a very substantial change in the division of wealth to the benefit of the rich. I think this is relevant to the health of a society (and a bad thing). Are you saying it has no bearing on society, it’s not a metric that matters? Or that it does, but you don’t care because your freedom takes precedence? 

I think it is relevant, but I also think that academia is by no means clear on what all the implications are, and at present this is not a layman's debate. When Wilkinson published the Spirit Level plenty of the left wing media leapt on it, just as they later would with Thomas Piketty's Capital. Both have turned out to be less definitive than the hype would suggest, which is not entirely the fault of either authors, but this has not stopped journos and politicians alike peddling them as the final answer to questions that are still open.

&gt; I also believe in equality of opportunity (who doesn’t?) but it’s simplistic to claim that it’s easy to achieve and just a matter of ignoring how wealth is acquired and distributed, or making the law blind to race, gender etc. Being born to rich parents, white, in a wealthy country, being the first born in a family, male, good looking and many other factors give unfair opportunities to a lucky few – they tend to do better than others. I’m guessing that, like me, you were born lucky in several ways and often discount that luck when we measure our success. Opportunities aren’t as equally distributed as all that and it’s certainly not as simple as there not being legalized discrimination.

See I think you've skirted over my point. I *don't* believe in the extended version of equality of opportunity, in which we seek to reduce the influence of those other factors you listed, at least as far as government policy goes, because I find the intrusions on freedom that necessitate such moves unpalatable, and many of the associated policies racist, sexist and blind to how reality works.

&gt; If you can only concede that it’s possible there’s a range of distribution of wealth which benefits everybody in society, then we’ll have found common ground. There’s no avoiding the authoritarian aspect of this since tax policy has a huge effect on it, and that’s not going away any time soon.

I distrust this rhetoric of ""better for everybody"", because I think politics is about trades rather than solutions. It might well be better for the mass to redistribute wealth, and perhaps even better as a net effect on society, but it often involves sacrificing somebody's interests. Clearly that's worth doing some of the time, but utilitarianism can sanction awful things if you let it. 

In general I prefer freedom to equality, but I guess that's an opinion. Some people view the bad effects of freedom as not worth the trade, and thus seek to restrict it, but I'm willing to trade bad consequences for more freedom, at least to a point.

Obviously it is which is why my post isn't about that it's about what the LSE could and couldn't do about it. It's basicly what I meant by putting ""privately"" in quotes because there's a distinction between personal behavior and public representation for a reason. 

It can get a bit murky when you are talking about teams but in the end how a bunch of people want to act in a bar is an issue between them, the bar, and the other patrons and I don't think it's a universities place to interfere no matter how despicable I may personally find that kind of behaviour. 

However in this case other students complained about the teams egregious behavior when the team was unquestionably acting in their role as an university club. This make it squarely something the university could and should address and it's good to see that they did.

Balo suits the 4-4-2 diamond system, because he'll have Sturridge (and hopefully the AM too) making runs off him for him to feed the ball to.

Not aware of any banks demanding continuous payment authority on a card to do the same thing, they just send you bills and red letters. But at the end of the day they respect the rule of law that it is your money to choose to pay your debts off or buy food, rather than making that decision for you. It would be like a loan shark turning up at your employer / benefits office and demanding your employer give the money to them because you're past due on your payments.

Additionally the reason wonga recently had to write off their loanbook is precisely because they were found to be deliberately giving these loans to people who could not afford to easily pay them back. There's a reason banks do credit checks and don't give loans to these people - they're so called 'judgment proof' - which means that even if you took them to court because they ignored your red letters, the CCJ would have a ridiculously low payment threshold say 50p.

Calum Chambers was a surprise to most of us, but again, we don't begrudge him his move to Arsenal - especially when we already had a better RB in Clyne.

Lovren and Lallana, however, have lost respect from the fans not because of the fact that they moved, but how they went about getting it.  They both threatened to go on strike (apparently), and Lallana saying that when he was playing for us as our captain, he was dreaming of playing for Liverpool, did not go down well - especially as less than a year earlier he'd said he wanted to finish his career at Southampton.

I think a fairly easy way of gauging how the club and fans feel about these players leaving is to look at the official statements on the club website; [Rickie Lambert, for example, gets a heartfelt article about how he leaves with the best wishes of the club](http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/02062014-statement-player-interest-rickie-lambert-1592309.aspx), [whereas Lallana gets four lines saying that he's left and the transfer fee will be used to buy new players](http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/article/01072014-adam-lallana-joins-liverpool-1708952.aspx).

Aside from that, I agree with thegnomesdidit, I figured it had to be slightly phased out of time until moments before birth. Otherwise humanity would have been picking up it's heartbeat and getting increasing heat signatures and all other manner of 'tells' along side the mass increasing.

Would also lend itself to why the creature lays eggs that look like moons, as we know real moons exist so they aren't all eggs. Perhaps it's a defensive measure, since the eggshell is the only tangible piece it needs to be camo as a result. 

All that said, I would have voted to kill it. As my main thought was how wasps lay their eggs inside caterpillars so that the heat feds the egg and they have ready to eat food upon hatching. I would've been to worried that the only reason such a creature would lay an egg in our orbit, would be so it's offspring had a meal waiting for it upon hatching. Thankfully that wasn't the case, but I would've voted that way out of fear personally.

A quick Google search led me to the following, which is brief and I thought it was a good start:    
a.  *[Developing a coherent argument](http://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/authors/guides/write/simply.htm?part=1)*    
b.  *[Using the paragraph effectively](http://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/authors/guides/write/simply.htm?part=2)*    
c.  *[Writing clear sentences](http://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/authors/guides/write/simply.htm?part=3)*    
d.  *[Avoiding wordiness](http://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/authors/guides/write/simply.htm?part=4)*

There are loads of resources you could look at, but these are brief and to the point.  As such I think they're a nice place to start.

As an absolute minimalistic basis I'd suggest:    
a.  Use short sentences.    
b.  Use the simplest words that mean what you need to say.  *(Bonus example:  I initially wrote this:  Use the simplest form of words that fully convey what you need to say.)*    
c.  Avoid technical terms unless they're actually needed.    
d.  Read it out *(ideally aloud)* after.  If you can get through the sentences without feeling like your lungs are about to explode and it flows smoothly, you're probably doing ok.

If you're using MS Word, under the Spelling and Grammar options there are things that will give you a readability score.  I'm not a fan of this, but you can use it to play with changes to a paragraph to see what it does to the readability score.

Edit: also, people keep saying they're plan was to blow up the moon. That was never their plan. When the Astronauts ask the Doctor why the moon is getting heavier, he says it's being caused by ""something alien"". Then, when the Doctor asks them what they're going to do with the bombs, she says ""the same thing you do with everything alien: blow it up"".

The bombs were there to destroy whatever was causing the moon to gain weight, not blow up the moon itself. By the doctor's own admission, the bombs aren't enough to destroy the moon, just to kill the creature. 

Why they thought they needed that many bombs to blow up the cause? I don't know, blame it on the bad writing. But they never claim they're going to blow up the moon, because that would be really stupid.

However!  

Some really good alternatives are;
   
1. If you'd like to support Indie - [fyrinnae Lip Lustre](http://www.fyrinnae.com/index.php?_a=viewCat&amp;catId=3) (lots of colours!, good reputation, you can buy smaller sizes to see if you like it)    
2. Another Indie brand is [PrettyZombieCosmetics](http://www.prettyzombiecosmetics.com/category/liquid-lipstick) (they have some pretty cool colours)
3. A low price brand that does dupes is [MUA luxe lip laqcuer](http://www.muastore.co.uk/lips/lip-lacquer) (not as many colours but pretty good quality for the price)  
4. A little bit more pricey is [Sleeks Matte Me lip gloss](http://www.sleekmakeup.com/lips/lip-gloss/matte-me-fandango-purple) (its matte don't worry) and they're really nice, its just finding somewhere that sells Sleek in store =/ but you can always order online!  
5. You could say [Nyx matte lip creams](http://www.nyxcosmetics.co.uk/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=110) are kinda similar but I dont think they are entirely, I find they go a bit funny after a few hours (could just be me though!)

false,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; Indeed, another problem with the assessments, is that people with mental health issues tend to want to fit in, to not be a burden etc, so they're likely to downplay their problems.

The government and the press have demonised anyone who needs the support the state *(by which I mean the people who pay the taxes spent by the state)* is supposed to be providing for decades.  

We all want to fit it.  The pressure to conform when you're told over and over and over that being ill, or needing help makes you lazy, or a shirker, or a scrounger must be horrifying.  It might be alleviated if you were told that the ATOS nurse had a target number of filthy scroungers to kick today and that saying, that you're not too bad today is cause to be flung on the reject pile.  We're all taught that nurses are there to help.  *(Pretty sure I was told the same about the police when I was a kid.)*

&gt; It's like how when you're asked 'how are you' you tend to say 'I'm fine' as you don't really think they want to hear your problems.

One idea worth investigating would be the Santander 123 current account which pays 3% interest on balances up to £20K. You need to ensure you pay in to the account once a month (e.g. ""pay"" yourself from a saving account) and you must set up at least 2 outgoing payment per month.

false,Firefox7275,null,null,"Are you using a sunscreen or any make up? Be aware that not all irritation/ inflammation is visible.

Don't scrub at skin that is already irritated/ dehydrated, use a chemical exfoliator or something gentle like a muslin cloth. There is no need to exfoliate daily anyway, the dead cells on the surface are part of the skin barrier (keeps water in, bacteria and irritants out).

I'd guess that foaming wash is based on a sulphate surfactant, research suggests these can thin and dehydrate even healthy skin so again too harsh. There are two face washes that are free of harsh surfactants: Boots Simply Sensitive and Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Wash Gel.

For moisturisers or spot treatment consider something with niacinamide (Freederm line, CeraVe AM or PM lotions (Amazon). The Simple Soothing Toner also has niacinamide and is super gentle. Niacinamide will help strengthen your skin barrier at the same time as fighting inflammation/ irritation and moderating sebum production. Nothing particularly wrong with the moisturiser you are using tho, I presume the antibacterial active is the zinc PCA.

What are you including the toner step for? You don't necessarily need one after a foaming cleanser, depends on the pH (should be acidic). I thought the micellar waters are supposed to be cleansers, in which case you are double cleansing which is unnecessary. That one contains zinc PCA, which duplicates your moisturiser's active. What happens if you use the micellar water as a cleanser *but not* the foaming cleanser or scrub?

That would be an interesting experiment since it means no new products or new ingredients and *hopefully* a chance for your skin barrier to recover a little. Do only change one product at a time, and patch test (you can do one product on each side of your face to speed up the process).

Diet-wise there are healthy convenience foods: canned oily fish (salmon/ pilchards/ mackerel), any frozen vegetables, frozen mixed berries or rhubarb, canned beans and lentils (count towards *at least* five a day), tomato paste, Loyd Grossman pasta sauces, steam in the bag fresh veggies, mixed nuts and seeds and so on. 

These all help reduce inflammation - whereas sugar, high glycaemic index/ white/ refined carbs, too much omega-6s (in many vegetable oils and nuts), larger servings of land animal muscle meat, excess caffeine and alcohol mess with your immune function/ trigger inflammation. Wheat is almost always eaten processed (pasta, bread, cereals) and most are on the medium to high end of the glycaemic index.

If you have a slow cooker and a stick blender you can make multiple healthy meals in bulk from scratch. It literally takes five minutes to throw a vegetable rich stew or curry together - no need to brown off the meat just throw it all in raw - I timed it for my nutrition clients.

&gt;There are men walking the street of Rotherham that have had just three years behind bars after raping little kids, who will be carrying psychological scars with them the rest of their lives.

and do you think those children will be any better off because those men aren't getting psychological help?

what do you think happens when someone enters prison with an idea on how justifiable a crime is, then leaves 3, 10, 30 years later with the same mindset? Are you seriously naive enough to think that they're going to do anything other than hide what they do better?

false,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"There is nothing wrong with the demographics of a nation changing. The problem is the speed at which it changes. 

One of the biggest reasons for this change is demographic is a result of the open door immigration policy this country has had.

The amount of change that some parts of the country have experienced over the last 20 years has undoubtedly caused tension and problems in many of these areas. 

The rise of parties like UKIP, and the possibility of the UK leaving the EU are two obvious political movements that have arisen in large part to these changes in demographic. 

Increasing tension and violence towards minorities are some social issues that have arisen because of these changes. 

A lack of compassion towards refuges in dire need of help as a result of a hardening of feelings towards immigrants in general, is another negative result of open door immigration policy.   

There are countless issues that the changing demographic of this country has caused, many of them negative, and almost all of them avoidable if people were willing to have a sensible discussion about the issues.

Top tip is to check out charity furniture shops . These will often deliver for a small fee. We got a massive kitchen table for £30 + delivery. It was just varnished heavily. Some sandpaper and nice paint and a weekend - we have a unique and awesome dining table.

In 3 years that's one of the only items we've genuinely been able to source cheaply that were pleased with.

This topic is of interest to me because the organization that pays my wages are into this ""promote women at all costs"" thing currently. I am more of the ""promote the best person - gender irrelevant - for the job"" school of thought.

So do you think that the fact that no woman has written for Dr Who since 2008 (Is this true first off?) is a major problem and it needs to be highlighted? How do you get a job as a writer on there? Do you apply or are you invited - I have no idea how it works. 

In my innocence I would think that if there were writers with the skill and imagination available to work there or looking for a job there that they would get it. 

So what do you suggest as a resolution? That they round up 5 female writers for the job and ask them to write an episode?

Or is the implication that Moffat - or whoever else - is anti-female and this is a genuine problem?

Again - not trying to troll or start a fight here - but genuinely interested. For me the gender thing is not a problem - Tina Fey did great work on SNL for example and look at 30 Rock. However I don't see the benefit in having someone in a team just because they tick a box - so a black person or an asian person or a female etc.... Hope I am making sense and not coming off as anti woman - I am not - just trying to ask a fair question.

In Germany, for every 10 MW of wind power added to the system at least 8 MW of back-up power must also be dedicated. Turbines also need power from the grid to work, leaving them useless in a blackout. Creating a wind farm creates jobs, like building roads and producing the vast amounts of concrete for the foundations. But they are only temporary.

1)Back when I was sixth form I got caught hoofing a lung outside st annes cathedral.  The police caught us rightly, I was still breathing out the smoke when they wandered over having been watching us for a bit.


They split us up and I was talking to a female officer. I was honest and admitted to what i was doing, apologised and handed over the small lump of hash when she said she would search me.

We get to talking and I explain that i'm studying atm and been accepted to a university etc. I was honest with my details, as were my friends so everything checked out.

They agreed to let it slide with an off the record warning cos they didn't want us starting off uni with a bad mark on us.


2) Another time, smoking a J on a park bench with a mate.  Cops were stood behind us on a ledge, again watching us and we were dead to rights.  They came over just as i'd finished and flicked it under me.  They start asking the usual questions, gathering details.  Again I was honest and upfront but didn't let on that I was smoking weed.  I'd said it was a cheap baccy that just smells a bit rough.

The ask to search me, which we'd consented to but they carry on checking the details.  Everything checks out so they explain that they had been called about some youths causing trouble in the park but we clearly weren't them.  They write up a stop n search explaining it was potential anti social behaviour.  Again nothing on the record.

Scary bit was I had a Half oz in my pocket.  Had we given them any excuse to actually properly search us ie. lying to them, then they would have 100% found it and they would probably not have let that amount slide.  We might even have been pinned for the damage that had caused to the park which is why they were called out.

Being honest, polite and civil is quite often enough to convince them that we're not the scumbags out there causing trouble even when your caught with your pants down.


3) Actually forgot bout this one but it's the best.

I'm a student in my flat.  GF had come over cos she was at a party that had turned nasty. Someone had stolen a mobile phone and some money. (We found out who it was later in the year when she robbed her BF's bank account and fraud squad were called.)

So my GF comes over and we're sitting for a bit, i'm having a smoke.  Police call to the door to explain they need to search for a stolen phone as my GF had been at the party.   I'm stood in my dressing gown at the door and without even thinking I say it's no problem, i can understand and we've nothing to hide.


They come into my room and I realise my mistake.  Bong on the table, half a joint, tub of ground weed, papers etc etc.    I sit on the bed and start bricking ing.

The 1st police officer opens with ""Have you anything you shouldn't have?""  I look around the room and can only laugh and smile at him.   He follows it up with 'Anything other than the weed?'

One of the officers goes into my mini fridge, opens the freezer compartment and pulls out an ounce of weed in a baggy.  I shit bricks........


He holds it up, gives it a good whiff and then says: ""keeping it fresh? That's what I like to see""

He puts it back, thanks me for being honest and says i'm clearly not involved in anything and can carry on with my night and off they go.

&gt;This was a narrative review that aimed to examine the changes in the available evidence on the adverse health effects of cannabis since 1993.
It was not clear how the author identified the studies used as a basis for the review. It may be the case there are other studies showing no effect or harm that have not been included in the review.


---
&gt;Also, although the author applied rules to the interpretation of the research, the conclusions are based on the results of observational studies.
It is difficult to conclude from these types of studies that cannabis causes the effects seen, as there are still potentially differences between people who use cannabis and people who don't that could explain the differences seen.

Really what we need is multiple power sources ready to be used, not just the cheapest, cleanest, or most stable. If we rely too heavily on one source of power, we're pretty much ensuring a single point of failure.

Rely too much on solar, and we're screwed if there's not enough sun. Same with wind turbines and not enough wind. Rely too much on oil and gas, and we have to import a lot of our fuel, raising costs and potentially getting fucked over if we piss off the wrong countries. And you only need to look at Fukushima to see what can happen when you rely too heavily on nuclear.

I personally think we should use nuclear for the majority of our electricity needs, with a healthy mix of wind, solar, hydro, and fossil fuels to back it up. That way, if we have to shut down a load of nuclear plants for some reason, we have enough reserve to avoid destabilising the grid and so won't end up in a situation where we have to rely solely on backup generators to keep the cooling pumps in the nuclear plants running, and hopefully keep blackouts to a minimum should such a situation occur.",0,1412776642,null,0,false,0,cl3qxgm,t3_2inbjd,t1_cl3qxgm,t1_cl3nqxm,null,1426627553,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

His MOTM vs Sunderland, his pressing which dispossessed the scum leading to the goal and his goal on the weekend completely undermine the article. The main conclusion of the article is rendered useless in this light and many of the other points made are just flat out wrong.

Some other points:

&gt;still working under instruction rather than playing by instinct.

Look at how AVB stifled the players creativity with his over instructive tactics (you must transition along this line, you must maintain this shape on attack). The free flowing (dare I say fluid) nature of our 3 behind the striker is well different. 

&gt;Either Eriksen works or he doesn’t play, and that’s a new situation for him.

This holds true for every player in the world. Also, ""That's a new situation for him"" is false. I'm sure any of his previous managers would have dropped him if needed.

&gt;Pre-season may have been punishing for Eriksen, but that in itself will not have conditioned him to play his new role in competitive Premier League games – the only way for him to adapt is to learn on the job and develop his match-fitness as the season progresses

This holds true for every player. Substitute any name in for Eriksen here (or elsewhere in the article) and it still reads the same, heavily implies this is mostly hot air.

In fact, that sums up the whole article. You could put in the name of any non-defender and it reads the exact same. It appears to be an interesting analysis of Eriksen going forward, but it is just a bunch of nice sentences without substance.

false,q_pop,null,null,"**Income Tax**

The dividends are paid net of basic rate tax, and carry a notional tax credit that can't be reclaimed.

What this means is as long as you are a basic-rate taxpayer you have no further liability, but you can't reclaim any tax if you're a non taxpayer. If you're a higher-rate taxpayer you have an additional liability of 22.5% on the notional gross dividend figure, and would need to settle this by Self-Assessment Tax Return.

**Capital Gains Tax**

This is only a potential issue when you sell the shares. You are liable to capital gains tax on any profits made, at a rate of 20% (if you're a basic rate taypayer) and 28% (if you're a higher rate taxpayer). You have an annual exemption of £11,000, meaning you can make £11,000 of profits in a given tax year and not be liable to tax on the gains. 

As you say the shares are worth £10k in total, you could sell the entire lot and not be liable to CGT (or need to let HMRC know about the sale), as long as you have no other taxable gains that year.

You could move the shares into an ISA. To do this you would effectively sell them at say 10.00am and rebuy them within an ISA at 10.01am. This would crystallise your capital gain, and any further gains within the ISA are tax-free. Also, you will never be liable to any further tax on the dividends, though you still can't reclaim the 10% tax credit.

There are other things to consider, though. Do you want to keep the shares? Are you comfortable with a single investment in one company? It would generally be considered pretty high risk and even ""safe"" blue-chip shares like, for example, Tesco can take a beating - the value of it's shares has halved in the last year.",0,1412777481,null,0,false,0,cl3rb2j,t3_2inqyf,t1_cl3rb2j,t3_2inqyf,null,1426627376,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

Cheap labour, more people wiling to work for minimum wage and a population with lower expectations of living standards are all fantastic for the economy, and I'm sure that the business owners who benefit from such things are thrilled with their ever increasing supply of cheap labour. 

Its the poor who suffer such circumstances. The people who benefit from a good economy most are the people at the top. 

&gt;Where there has been 'tension' there has also been increased multi-culturalism and awareness of other cultures.

Such as Rotherham for example? I'm sure that there is a lot of awareness about Pakistani culture there, but not in a good way. 

Greater understanding and awareness of other cultures doesn't necessarily mean greater tolerance, and does little to improve the situation when conflict does arise. In fact, as can be seen from the aftermath of Rotherham, often multiculturalism creates an ""us vs them"" mentality. 

&gt; mostly old white folks who will be gone soon enough....

&gt;maybe the creature uses photosynthesis or something

That makes no sense. Photosynthesis doesn't create mass, it just moves it around. Now, maybe you're talking about actually transforming the energy of the sun to mass. That sounds like a fun question, so let's do the mass.

Conversion is expressed by E=mc^2. We have the speed of light, we're looking for the mass, so we need to find the energy (in Jules). 

The sun's maximum energy at the earth (same distance from the sun) is  1737 Watts (which is J/s, so we're on the right track) per M^2. Now we need the area of the moon. Radius is 1737km, which makes the area (since only one side is facing the sun at a time) effectively 9,473,911^2. In meters (to match up our units) that's 9.473 * 10^12 m^2. 

Ok, so we multiply the area of the moon with the watts/m^2 to get 1.33 * 10^16 Watts(or J/s). Now, let's say we assume that the moon absorbs ALL of that energy, and transfers ALL of it into mass (meaning the moon would not reflect the sunlight at all, and I think we'd notice that). Divide the number above by c^2, and you get 0.148 kg/s of mass the moon could gain. That's 12,851kg per day, 4,690,677 kg per year, and 4.69 *  10^14 kg over 100,000,000 years (that number was mentioned for some reason in the show).

So, how much is that really? Well, that means that, over 100,000,000 years the moon would gain an astounding 0.0000006% of its mass. That would have a tiny impact on its gravitational effects on earth.

As for debris, the amount of debris that would have to hit it would pretty much guarantee that all life on earth would have been wiped out long ago (since we're dangerously close to the moon and all, and it's not going to gain that much mass without us being hit by some planet killing shit).

So basically, conservation of mass absolutely DOES mean jack shit as long as you understand the inputs and outputs. ",0,1412778325,null,0,false,0,cl3rpqz,t3_2iazo2,t1_cl3rpqz,t1_cl1rxm5,null,1426627186,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

There have been many examples of immigrants coming to settle in this country over its history, and up until now there has been very little problem with integration.

It is only over the last 20 or so years that issues about immigration and integration have become a real problem.

The last 20 years have also seen the greatest rate of influx of immigrants into this country that has ever been seen. That is not a coincidence. 

The speed at which immigration has occurred in the last 20 years has caused a great deal of tension between groups, and not just recent immigrants. People are now able to see the change in demographics much more clearly than in the past, when it was too gradual to notice. I think that this has caused resentment towards groups who were already here before the more recent influx took place, and also tension between immigrants who have been settle here a long time and those who have only recently arrived.

Especially if the character is only going to be in one or two episodes.

It's not just a problem with Doctor Who, but all television. It's why you can often guess who the killer is on a mystery show, just because of conservation of characters. In a real murder investigation, there's usually many suspects that have to be gone through. Family, friends, associates, etc. In a murder mystery, they only have time to to include the killer and a few red herrings to try and trip you up. And even then, the characters are usually tissue thin, being just deep enough to provide a motive and that's about it.

There is no known lethal dose for cannabis, it's estimated to be somewhere above 20,000 times the effective dose. 579 people died in the UK last year as a result of heroin/morphine. There have been no deaths as a result of cannabis worldwide. 

Heroin is chemically addictive, cannabis is not. The article didn't define ""regular use"" but I'm confident that the same ""regular use"" of heroin would result in far more than 1 in 10 becoming addicted. 

The withdrawal symptoms of heroin are (from wikipedia): 
&gt;The withdrawal syndrome from heroin (the so-called ""cold turkey"") may begin within 6 to 24 hours of discontinuation of the drug; however, this time frame can fluctuate with the degree of tolerance as well as the amount of the last consumed dose. Symptoms may include:[51] sweating, malaise, anxiety, depression, akathisia, priapism, extra sensitivity of the genitals in females, general feeling of heaviness, excessive yawning or sneezing, tears, rhinorrhea, sleep difficulties (insomnia), cold sweats, chills, severe muscle and bone aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramps, watery eyes,[52] fever and cramp-like pains and involuntary spasms in the limbs (thought to be an origin of the term ""kicking the habit""[53]).

And what wikipedia has to say about cannabis:
&gt;According to Delphic analysis by British researchers in 2007, Cannabis has a lower risk factor for dependence compared to both nicotine and alcohol.[102] However, everyday use of Cannabis can in some cases be correlated with psychological withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and insomnia,[96] and evidence could suggest that if a user experiences stress, the likeliness of getting a panic attack increases because of an increase of THC metabolites.[103][104] However, Cannabis withdrawal symptoms are typically mild and are never life-threatening.[105]

&gt;

&gt;__Michael Aloysius Tabor__ (December 13, 1946 – October 17, 2010) was an American member of the [Black Panther Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_Party) who was charged and tried as part of an alleged [conspiracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_(crime\)) to bomb public buildings in [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City) and kill members of the [New York Police Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Police_Department). Four months into the trial Tabor and another defendant fled to [Algeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria). Despite his ultimate [acquittal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal) on all charges, Tabor remained in exile in [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa) until his death, never returning to the United States.

&gt;Tabor was born on December 13, 1946, in [Harlem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem) and joined the Black Panther Party while in his teens. In 1970, Tabor and 12 other members of the Black Panthers were charged for their involvement in a plot to kill police officers and to plant bombs in New York City commercial and public buildings, including the [New York Botanical Garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Botanical_Garden) in the [Bronx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx). Support for the prosecution's case came from undercover officers who claimed that the defendants had developed plans for a series of bombings and had conducted classes to instruct those participating in the plot how to construct explosive devices. 

&gt;Together with fellow defendant Richard Moore, Tabor failed to appear at their trial in February 1971, forfeited $150,000 in [bail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail) and were declared fugitives. Blank Panther leader [Huey P. Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huey_P._Newton) called Moore and Tabor ""enemies of the people"" for evading justice while on trial and putting the other defendants and the party at risk.  Connie Matthews, Newton's former secretary and Tabor's wife, also left the country and was said to have taken valuable records with her.  The two finally surfaced in Algeria the following month together with [Eldridge Cleaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldridge_Cleaver).

It's a very complex issue on the macro level, as there are many different micro effects, [the governments own report looks at some of these.](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/287287/occ109.pdf) As I mention, my skill set (software engineering) is being held back by high wages, there are many opportunities that are simply not profitable when even a bottom of the barrel developer is costing 300 per day.  This is an oddity in some simple micro economics views because supply and demand is meant to be optimising itself, obviously that can not work well with second (or higher) order systems.

Think of the example as more websites became available, more people started using the internet, as those websites started letting people do more, more people were asking companies (or switching to those that did) do more.

Sure. But as Nigel Farage said (and people here in this subreddit are also keen to point out), what's good for GDP isn't what is good for people who live here.

If you were a low paid or relatively unskilled worker, immigration has made things much harder. It's a tough pill to have politicians on TV and students etc saying how immigration is good for you when you've lost your job.

For me, it just means I can get a cheaper cleaner. Or if I was running a business employing low skilled people, I can fire the British ones and hire much cheaper Easter Europeans. That sounds pretty awesome.

But for older people, they have seen their local area change very quickly. New people, wearing different costumes, their local GP now full of people speaking a different language, bilingual street signs. And people in those areas never asked for mass immigration, but they had it forced upon them. Again, is it any surprise that there is backlash now?

I think we should look at what is best for the UK as a whole - that includes the economy, but also British people who live here and grew up here. Their happiness should also be taken into account. We can have a sensible balance of immigration and quality of life. It doesn't need to be a free-for-all or a closed borders hostile nation.

You are the one who used the blanket statement that ""It's easily proven that immigration has been a benefit to our economy"". I am simply explaining that something that benefits the economy does not necessarily benefit the average person, much less the poor. 

&gt;Umemployment for instance has no correlation and avg incomes are inline with the western world.

How do you come to that conclusion? Almost any investigation into such statistics will be politically motivated, you it is important to be careful when coming to such conclusions. For example unemployment is officially quite low, but how many people are on zero hour contracts, or work part time and have to rely on benefits to survive? If a government wants to make the picture look better than it is, there are ways of doing so. 

&gt;Rotherham is terrible, but just an anecdote. I can give you plenty of other anecdotes but I'm sure you won't care....

One benefit does not cancel out one negative. You say that while there has been tension there has also been multiculturalism and understanding. I say that those two things are completely unrelated. Its great there is more understanding of different cultures, but that does nothing to solve the problem of increased tension, anger and violence between communities. 

&gt;No, racists and bigots create the 'Us v them' mentality with stereotypes like yours. They use any bad thing they can to further their preconceived notions.

No, putting two groups with different identity's, goals and ideas together creates an ""us vs them"" mentality. It is hardly reserved to bigots and racists. Have you ever been to a competitive sports event? Cricket, Football Rugby? The ""us vs them"" mentality exists everywhere, and that needs to be recognised. It takes time, patience and understanding to bring two groups of people together, especially if they may have conflicting principles. Simply announcing that we are now ""multicultural"" and that it is not acceptable to have any negative feelings towards any other group was bound to case problems. Especially between those who are less well off. 

&gt;I suppose I should have taken out the 'white' part from statement... odd that you take umbrage with that stereotype but use plenty with minorities...

My problems with Sinn Fein are numerous. I can remember members of the party using terms like ""Legitimate target."" That is the most sickening terms that were coined during the troubles in my opinion. Try telling an 8 year old child their police officer father in traffic branch was shot because he was a ""legitimate target.""

I don't like their double standards. They say it was a war, okay fair enough. Then wars are governed by the Geneva convention and one of the rules of that is not targeting civilians, which the IRA, dress it up as much as you want, did target civilians.

They are trying to rewrite history. When I was writing my Masters on the Civil Rights movement, not one person I talked to could remember SF or members of SF being of any major or significant influence. The way SF talk, they created the whole damn movement. 

I don't like how they govern. Look at the record of their Ministers and try and convince me they have been a benefit to the people of Northern Ireland. We now have 2 self regulating transfer tests. Northern Ireland is being dragged into the financial stoneage because they don't want to contradict their stance in the south, one Minister was sued because he denied an appointment and his decision was found to be based on religious and political background. One Minister went against Civil Service advice and got the department sued by the European Union to the tune of millions.

They want an Irish language act where every government and council body in Northern Ireland should provide their official documents in Irish. Why? How many people are going to request council minutes from Larne Borough Council in Irish? It's a waste of time, money and effort.

Should UKIP's £55,000,000 a day EU membership cost claim be correct, leaving the EU should save us £20,075,000,000 in membership fees alone. In fact, according to Fullfact.org, it is correct [although rebates and agricultural policies which benefit UK farmers in particular make the actual cost of being in the EU about £33,000,000 a day or £12,045,000,000 a year.](https://fullfact.org/economy/cost_eu_membership_gross_net_contribution-30887) It's still a pretty big expense and at the cost of border control and many other policies forced upon us that our citizens and politicians do not necessarily agree with.

A company like Virgin currently benefit from good public image because they only run modern, fast trains on modern, fast lines.

I can honestly say I much prefer RoSPA over IAM. The big differences I've seen between the two are attitude. Both are more or less the same when it comes to ""safe riding"", but RoSPA seems to consider _all_ factors when talking about ""safe riding"" and not just riding itself.

For instance, very few IAM guys within the blood bikers knew about pre-ride checks (or POWDDERSS) whereas every single RoSPA rider did.

Personally I prefer the graded result; no single ride is 'the perfect ride' so always having something to concentrate on to improve is beneficial.

Another major thing that others have mentioned is the 3-yearly retests with RoSPA (although I believe IAM are now considering this as well) - I'd much rather be able to say ""I'm currently a RoSPA Gold"" than ""I passed my IAM 25 years ago"".

In her younger days she was impulsive and did not take into account the consequences of her actions. As she got older, that changed, and she became a master of seeing the way cause and effect intertwined and lying (when necessary, and even at great personal cost) to preserve the timelines. 

River has effortlessly organized her life to juggle a career that she's passionate about, a marriage to an ageless god, and an extended prison term, changing the rules whenever they get in the way of what she wants. She is outwardly confident, boldly sexual, and physically tough, but hides a core of insecurity and vulnerability around her back-to-front relationship with the Doctor.

Clara is nurturing character drawn to jobs and situations where she can care for other people, often but not exclusively children. She is somewhat unconfident in the areas of romance and sex, since she fears letting anyone see beneath the facade of chirpy competence that she projects to the world, to the anger, hurt, and confusion that lies beneath.

She tries very hard to compartmentalize her life into neat boxes that never touch, believing that this is the only way she can have everything she wants out of life. The idea of those boxes spilling over and mixing is utterly terrifying to her, but also inevitable. 

She fails to understand that she cannot reach outward to control other people (forcing Danny and the Twelfth Doctor to like each other, for instance), but should instead look inward for ways to control her life by choosing to stay in situations that are healthy for her and leave situations that are not healthy for her. She is deeply, imperfectly human.

Honestly, I'm struggling to see the way in which these characters are similar, beyond the fact that they both have boobs.

I didn't say it did have anything to do with immigration. You are conflating the issues in your own mind.

The point I am making is that you believe immigration is a good thing because it is beneficial  to the economy. That was the first statement you made.  

I am saying that immigrations economic benefits are irrelevant, because it doesn't actually benefit the country in any way that will improve the lives of ordinary people. When a politician defend immigration by telling the public that it benefits the economy, he is being dishonest, he is implying that the benefits they bring will help their lives in some way, when they will not. 

&gt;And changed. Friendly banter about your favourite team is quite different thing than judging someone based upon their skin colour.

How do you change those attitudes overnight?  Like I said, you cannot just change attitudes so quickly. It is a long and slow process. 

And there is plenty of violence over sport results.

&gt;Especially between those who are less well off.
&gt;that is only anecdotal. I am very much in favour of progressive taxes, living wage etc. The poor are not worse off due to immigration and if you could prove it please do...

While the poor have undoubtedly suffered to some extent as a result of immigration, what I actually meant was that it is more likely for their to be tension between immigrants and the native population in poorer areas than in more well off areas. 

The poor have suffered as a result of wage suppression and  greater competition for jobs. You of course would call that a political issue, but with the majority of people in this country being in favour of immigration reform, and all political parties being in favour of cutting immigration, there clearly is a consensus on the effect that immigration is having on the poor.

If you build a power station far away from where the power gets used you end up losing quite a bit in transport. With solar plants you tend to get the limitation that they need to be ~50 miles to where the power is gonna get used - which is great for the states where you have cities in the desert. The national grid is considered ~90% efficent (I believe) and it is not recommended to run power from one side of the country to the other.

From what I recall there were energy companies looking at setting up wind farms off the northern islands of scotland. The problem has been that the cabling is expensive and it can be cheaper to build a self-sustained island. They are planning to lay the cable and now no one wants to build windfarms.

The other problem I see is long term maintenance. I was at a small energy conference and one of the PhDs I met was looking into the lifetime costs of offshore windfarms. This takes into account the fabrication and instillation but also repair and maintenance crews which need to be shipped.

And as for Hudd, we just couldn't fit him in.  We need our second CM to be able to contribute a lot defensively, and he's just not able.  Carroll is also shaky in terms of his presence in midfield.  And they ignore Bentaleb completely.

And on the topic of our defenders, they do realize that Daws was the only one who's severe lack of pace was an issue, right?  Kaboul is fine, Fazio is quicker, and so far better positionally, than Daws.  We don't have issues with our back line right now.

Didn't you read what I said about FPS? I never said they both run all games in 60fps I said they both could but some developers choose to cap games on certain consoles, there are also games on PS4 that are capped to 30fps. Without the cap both consoles could easily run most games in 100+fps. Also, the link you provided said nothing about Xbox One running Diablo in 30fps it only mentioned a difference in resolution which isn't the same thing and has since been [updated](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2014-diablo-3-xbox-one-1080p-patch-performance-analysis).

BF4 100% has timed content for the [Xbox One](http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Battlefield_4:_Second_Assault). Check the release dates, standard Xbox One users got the DLC 4 months before Premium PS4 users and a further month ahead of standard PS4 users.

Halo is definitely the messiah of console FPS and the only games that come closs are available on both consoles, there literally isn't a PS4 exclusive FPS that even deserves to be compared. 

I used to like GT when I played on PS and like I said, Forza was that good in comparison I simply can't enjoy GT anymore.

Yeah indie games may be popular but they also very easy to run and considering most people have a PC or Laptop in their house it really is pointless choosing a console based on indie games.

How is downloadable **content** a stange thing to put under content? Again, it has exclusively timed content for the most popular two shooters and has exclusive content for the biggest sports game in the world which is a big bonus for most people on a sports related sub.

Wasn't aware Now TV was on already and Youtube definately isn't it probably will arrive but it again is something that came to Xbox One first, not almost a year later.

I don't particularly understand the uproar caused by the franchise being awarded to a foreign company. I can appreciate that people don't want to see profit generated on our network being funnelled out of the country to invest in a foreign rail network however this is happening all over the UK. I didn't hear much mention of it before but as soon as it occurs in your neck of the woods, suddenly people are upset. Sure, we want investment at home but from what I have read in the proposal this sounds great!

The Dutch (NS) are already running Northern Rail, Merseyrail and Greater Anglia through Abellio.

The Germans (DB) are running Arriva Trains Wales, CrossCountry, Grand Central, Chiltern, Tyne &amp; Wear Metro and London Overground.

The French (SNCF) owns 30% of Govia Thameslink, SouthEastern and London Midland whilst holding 45% of the shares in First Transpennine Express through Keolis.

So to only start complaining quite so vocally now seems bizarre to me because foreign national railways running franchises here is an inherent part of the system and one of them winning the ScotRail franchise was always a possibility.

We are looking at 80 new trains for use between Edinburgh and Glasgow whilst we already have the EGIP program going on to invest in the infrastructure along with rolling electrification across the network. On top of this a brand new, top notch intercity service using refurbished HSTs at a cost of only £5 standard fare between any two Scottish cities when you book in advance. Even first class is only £7.50! Free wi-fi on all trains, improved catering, investments in stations, more carriages...

Personally I am really looking forward to the franchise change. You can bet that I'll be travelling between Glasgow and the North on an HST for only £7.50!",0,1412784752,null,0,false,0,cl3uzjx,t3_2io16g,t1_cl3uzjx,t3_2io16g,null,1426625628,4,false,uktrains,t5_2z9xu,4

Even if the PSNI were unarmed they would still be targeted.

&gt;I'd like to know just how often the PSNI actually use their guns

They actually draw their guns a lot but use them very rarely. [These] ( http://www.psni.police.uk/use_of_force_1_april_2013_-_31_march_2014_web.pdf) statistics show that the PSNI draw their guns hundreds of times every year. However they very very rarely every fire them at somebody. If I do my sums right it's 1.5 times a year on average going by that table. However [these] (http://www.psni.police.uk/firearm_usage.pdf) statistics show *every* time a gun was fired by the PSNI in about a 2 year period. These stats show that the big dopes accidentally fire all the fucking time and that they kill an animal every few months or so. And off the top of my head 3 people have been killed by the PSNI: a dissident in 2003, a joyrider in 2006 and a robber in 2011.

However the number of times the PSNI have fired their weapons is kinda irrelevant, they carry the weapons mainly as a deterrent. The dissidents know that the police carry weapons, so if they want to attack them they have to plan accordingly. If the police didn't carry guns however any old dissident could stroll up to an officer and shoot them dead, knowing there's no possibility they could be shot themselves. Of course there's other reasons too, it makes the officers feel safer and that if they do ever come under fire they can fire back for example, but the deterrent is the main reason.

Well, if my group was excluded, then firstly, I would check and inspect my worldview to ensure that I am truly right. Then if I am convinced that I'm right, I won't cry about it, since the university has no responsibility to endorse my views or be okay with them, and I would use other avenues (and band together with others who believe in the same thing) to broadcast my views, which the university cannot touch. They can condemn the views but they can't ban everything. The university has a right to free speech too, wouldn't you say? They also have the right to control what is being said in their stead.

Yes, this is not alien to me. I'm an atheist and LSE has banned the Atheist society from doing some things too.

And I think that's the key difference between our views.  In the hypothetical you answered, you perceive the university as playing the role of an 'endorser' of speech and you argue that no university should have to endorse any speech they don't like.  But, I don't see it that way at all.  I think the university should be taking the position that they're not necessarily endorsing *any* speech from the students or the staff.  Rather, they should be in the business of *protecting* the right of people to express their opinions.

Why is this important?  Because part of the role of universities is to discuss and evaluate ideas which are at the cutting edge.  Ideas which may be seen by many people as absolutely ludicrous or even offensive.  For instance, ideas which may offend the religious, or the political norms of most people.

If you take the position that the university can (and maybe should) remove the forum for speech it finds troubling, then you're placing unpopular ideas at the mercy of administrators, lawyers, middle-men, busy-bodies and so on.  People who can be nobbled by politicians or the wealthy.  I think that's extraordinarily dangerous.

When they went to arrest they guy he tried to set the officer on fire (don't ask me how). In the station they asked him why did he do it. Your man responded how every time something like that happens the hospital just drugs him for a few days and lets him out and that the cycle repeats. He even said that if he's arrested again the next month he'll probably try and set the officer on fire again. Every week or so after this the same officer who was nearly set on fire goes to his house and talks with him for a few hours, which according to the person I was talking to really helped the poor lad out.

On the other hand I've spoken to an officer who said they're happy when the homeless addicts die. They said all they do is steal and mug people and are the most frustrating people they have to work with. They said they're a drain on society and it's good when they die off.

So we go from one officer who takes time out of their life to help someone out to another who uses the same logic as the Nazis. I guess what I'm trying to say is while there's some real cunts in the police there's also some really nice and good people also.

They are also susceptible to all that you mention, so I've never thought of it as some kind of protective bubble or safe space. That is why I don't think it's dangerous - it's just the real world. As students, we will face such challenges to our free speech later on in life, and we need to know how to either adapt in some way (for example, using other methods, or just sucking it up).

I don't agree that universities don't get a right to say where they stand on issues. They are staffed by people, who like it or not, are actually hurt by public backlash. In an ideal world, sure, they can act like some bastion of free speech that just provides a forum for debate, but this is the real world. People will hate and leave the university, and our reputation will drop even further for no good reason. I don't think it's fair to the other users of the university. While you may think that the universities can be this fair unbiased moderator in a debate, the world does not work that way - if an individual in the university says something bad, people will think the university is supporting them if it remains silent - so I'd rather the university state where they stand so we can judge them on their own position.

Yes, that is part of their role, but with the advent of the internet, I think there are now better ways for people to share ideas without using the name of another party. I don't understand what's so important about university protection of freedom of speech in this day and age. People still can scream whatever they want on the internet. Oh, it has no respectability and will be ignored because it's on the internet? Well, if a person feels that way, then maybe that person is trying to make use of the university's name to lend more weight to their argument.

Well, I don't.  I think that universities should take academic freedom very seriously and I think that most academics would agree.

I completely understand your feeling that some speech should be beyond the pail and that universities should act if it's in danger of harming their reputations.  But time and again, what we see is that centralized authorities take the more conservative position about what is or isn't acceptable.  If you give committees and authorities the power to reject bad speech they will end up using it to restrict merely *unpopular* ideas.  Think of all the truly great literature which has been at one time subject to censorship, because arbiters of good taste thought it mind offend people.

Is it unrealistic to expect universities to defend free-speech?  Goodness.  I hope not!  If they won't do it, then who will?

I'm still not convinced that LSE should relinquish all their rights over what people can say as a representative of the school. (I'm not sure if it's LSESU or LSE that disbanded them - I think it's the LSESU which owns all the clubs and funds them).

&gt;I completely understand your feeling that some speech should be beyond the pail and that universities should act if it's in danger of harming their reputations. But time and again, what we see is that centralized authorities take the more conservative position about what is or isn't acceptable. If you give committees and authorities the power to reject bad speech they will end up using it to restrict merely unpopular ideas. Think of all the truly great literature which has been at one time subject to censorship, because arbiters of good taste thought it mind offend people.

The thing is, the universities have no control over what these students can do when they are not representatives of the university. They can only condemn them, but it's not even close to being a totalitarian state. So I think you're drawing a false analogy here. It's not being censored. Consider the recent case of a customer of Comcast attempting to use his company's name to force Comcast to take action. Is the customer being fired by his company an attack on free speech? He just cannot make use of others' names as he wishes, hardly draconian.

I come from an authoritarian state myself (Singapore), and believe me, this is nothing close to totalitarian censorship. Censorship is when you are not allowed to use a medium to express yourself that you have a right to use. These students do not have a right to use LSE's name; it is a privilege given to them by the school. Their real rights to express these views on redpill or whatever aren't being taken away from them. Their rights to play rugby aren't being taken away from them - they can join so many other London clubs or form their own independent one in the meantime.",0,1412788019,null,0,1412788918,0,cl3wqqv,t3_2iltod,t1_cl3wqqv,t1_cl3wkf7,null,1426624683,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Wonga is predatory. A hell of a lot of customers that just had their debts written off had multiple loans with Wonga.

This type of lending is predatory. End of. Sure, payday loans are not too horrible, if regulated properly (Like, I dunno, the way Aussies have done it, with interest rates getting capped so you cannot end up owing too much). 

Nobody should turn to Wonga. Ever. Crisis loans from the Government should be their first port of call.

I live in an area which, until recently, has experienced some extremely poor economic conditions and large scale unemployment. It's an area which now has a burgeoning tourist industry based around an unspoilt landscape and environment, employing around 10,000 people and gradually growing and improving the economic situation of the region.

It is also an area which currently has around 15 planning applications for wind turbine sites (largely driven by the onset of government subsidies).

Survey data, from various sources, has suggested that tourists would quite seriously not want to go to, and would stop going to, this area. People travel to the area just to experience the landscape and so spend money in the area using various services and attractions, which would then be put in jeopardy.

So, in this case, it's not particularly irrational that local residents, businesses and councils would oppose such onshore wind turbine sites. 

It's not always just a case of ""NIMBYism"". There can often be legitimate concerns, not related to political agendas or personal problems with wind turbines themselves.

One thing I dont get from Sundays game is, playing basically the same team we payed 3 days ago, and bringing on Griffiths when we have our new big signing in Scepovic on the bench.

Also, isn't he supposed to be some man all about youth? If so, where is Rogic, Henderson, Fischer etc? Yeah he gives McGregor a go but personally id really like to see him give other youth players a run in the team, especially Tom Rogic, I think he could be crafted in to a great player, but thats just my opinion.

Over all, Deila hasnt been impressive so far, not horiible but not anywhere near the standard he should be at, especially if we are in Europe, **but if we aren't top of the league come Christmas, I want him gone**.

The largest wind turbine I can find has a [10MW max rated output](http://www.power-technology.com/features/featurethe-worlds-biggest-wind-turbines-4154395/), realistically the average output will be 25 per cent the rated output. That's 2.5MW. The turbine has a 190m diameter. 

Hinkley Point C is a 3200 MW plant. It has an average output of about 90 per cent giving an average output of 2880 MW. 

It would take 1152 turbines to produce the same output as Hinkley point, that's about a 34*34 turbine square . With a blade diameter of 190m, assuming 50m between each turbine (way too low clearance between turbines but I'm making a point) it forms a rectangle of 8.1km by 1.7km. That's 13.787 km2. 

Hinkley Point C is on a 67 hectare site. That's 0.67 km2. That's 20 times smaller than an equivalent windfarm using the largest blades today. 

So to conclude wind power is inefficient compared to nuclear and takes far more space than nuclear (or conventional fossil fuels).

Sure NFL seasons are relatively short but it's divided up into two conferences and divided even more with localized divisions. Then you got wild cards and playoffs, so all in all there's a decent amount of breathing room for most teams. One game seems way more trivial in that regard.

NBA, MLB, NHL have a crap ton of games so one game being played abroad can get a pass since there's a huge cushion for error. 

1 game out of 38 is still a pretty big deal regardless of it not seeming like it.

I don't use sunscreen everyday, just in the summer (when I have to use it a lot because I'm so pale and burn easily), should I be wearing it all the time? I've been avoiding make-up since the acne started to come back (other than mascara) because I was worried about making it worse. 

I thought the Micellar water was a toner until stufstuf corrected me yesterday (told you I was dense about this stuff!) but I tried using it as my only cleanser this morning. My face didn't feel as clean as it does after a foaming wash but it's good for taking off make-up so might continue to use it for that. 

Having read your comments and looked at other posts, the wiki etc. I think I am going to change my routine to the following

Cleanse: the Boots sensitive foaming face wash and Micellar Water to remove make-up on the days I wear it.

Toner: Simple kind to skin soothing toner

Moisturiser: I'm going to stick with the Simple spotelss anti-blemish moisturiser because it is the only moisturiser I've found that doesn't make my skin feel greasy/break me out

In my opinion disarming them won't really make much of a difference to how the dissidents view them. The dissidents are incredibly stubborn. After all the reforms to the police, the end of Protestant control, a political means to achieve a United Ireland and the loss of support within Nationalist communities for violence they continue to ""wage war"".  Even if they were disarmed they would still do the mental gymnastics to see them as a sectarian and oppressive force that they really aren't. 

The PSNI are a very militarised force. We could disarm them and take away some of that aura of being an armed extension of the British government. However it wouldn't do much if they still drive about in armoured landrovers, have 20 ft walls around their stations and wear bulletproof vests. It would be hard enough trying to convince the officers to be disarmed, but there's no way they would except getting rid of all the protection they have.

While I agree it is important to have a neutral and impartial police service the police are intrinsically a side in this conflict. Whether Republicans like it or not at the end of the day the PSNI still administers British rule in Northern Ireland. The only way the police could be considered neutral is if there's no conflict in the first place.

But there are a lot of options that come to mind. Pull some of the writers from Bioware who worked on KoToR and Mass Effect, put them on a multi-parter or even overarching season script that involves the doctor building a team gathered from around the universe, with complicated and interesting back stories the doctor learns while gaining their loyalty before going up against a big bad (again I kid)

Really, person who I'd love to see write for who is alive but probably is no longer in any condition to do so even if offered is Terry Pratchett. I know his Discworld literary humor would fall flat onscreen, unless the doctor describes something outlandish before we see it looking exactly as described. 

Mix a bit of Sam Vimes with Rincewind (Main characters in two of the sub-series of the Discworld Novels) and you'd have a good idea of how he might portray the doctor.

Two examples I've personally enjoyed, though of course YMMV:

Dollhouse was a brilliant but short-lived (2 seasons) SF series with, I think, 8 women writers (Sarah Fain, Tracy Bellomo, Maurissa Tancharoen, Elizabeth Craft, Jane Espenson, Michele Fazekas, Tara Butters, Jenny DeArmitt).

Person of Interest, currently near the start of its fourth season, has 5 (Denise Thé, Amanda Segel, Amy Berg, Melissa Love, Ashley Gable). Personally I find its quality varies but when it's good, it's excellent.

Both are what I consider ""proper"" SF in that they create a world with certain rules slightly different to our own, then gradually explore the consequences of those differences over time. Both have an ""X of the week"" formula that masks this initially, because in both cases it seems like the SF element is sort of an excuse for the formula — but over time, it turns out, it's really not.

* They are low capacity (a problem at rush hour).
* The stops are usually close together (meaning slower journeys).
* Other traffic holds it up (again, a problem at rush hour).
* They are usually mostly tied to the road.

Now from my own personal experience where I live I have found it quicker to cycle. I'm not fit (size 18-20) but it's easier than most think and quicker. I shave 10 mins off my journey time when compared with a bus. This has it's restrictions, not everyone can cycle and the weather (wind especially) can be an issue, along with infrastructure.

In an ideal world, light rail would make longer distance urban journeys quicker, but not everywhere has the money or space for that, especially when we're talking about something off road. Rail fares have gone up higher than they need to be (which is a scandal) and in an ideal world bringing them down to inflation would be wonderful, but corporate interests are seeing to that not being possible.

If you want a cheap and easy option involving buses, having more limited stop express buses would be a good plan. These types of buses exist for services like airport journeys or sometimes linking places like massive shopping centres to the city centre, but imagine if you will a bus that has fewer stops, further apart, all day and all year round. Stops could be rebranded and given ticket machines at the stop so people aren't faffing about paying the driver (which takes up a lot more time at stops than you'd imagine. Enforcing bus lanes would also be a good idea, if an unpopular one.

A *less* cheap option would be dedicated roads/guided systems. This would work if there was a lot of green/brownfield strips and old railway lines and would separate buses from traffic for a section of the journey.

Ordered two different sample packs, both were dispatched the next working day despite no charge for postage.

My messages were responded to within two working days, addressed my concerns, offered replacement samples which again were dispatched swiftly. Professional customer service, recommended.

- [Superdrug]

Returned an own brand cleanser that was irritating my sensitive skin, had the box but no receipt. No quibble cash refund, recommended.

- Bodycare

Returned an eyelash/ brow dye kit that had a new formula: not only was it ineffective but it burned and triggered my atopic eczema. Whilst polite the store tried to say they'd have to return it to the manufacturer for them to refund. Luckily I knew my consumer rights (legal contract is with the vendor) and insisted on a replacement.

A lot of the time consultants in private healthcare work in the NHS as well splitting their time between the two I find so you may find the person you go to see could have been seen on the NHS. The difference being you would have to wait months on the NHS and private you see them next week, just as an example.

On top of that it and the staff are over worked, under paid and generally resent patients as objects who get in the way of them doing whatever else they think their job is.

false,duckalors,null,null,"Generally you will continue to go to your GP as normal. Some (expensive) policies might offer private GP cover as well but I think this is the exception rather than the rule. 

As with all specialist treatments the insurance company and consultant will want a referral from a GP - so you can't just decide you need to see a urologist for example, a GP still needs to think it necessary (although I suspect they are easier to convince if you  are being referred to a private consultant).

At the point that you've seen your GP (or indeed a private GP) and they think you need to see a specialist consultant, you let them know you have private cover and they will often have a list of private consultants to be referred to (you can pick) but crucially they need to be at a hospital or unit that is available on your health plan. When you get private insurance you will be given a list of all the hospitals covered / or access to their details on website etc. This is where the advantages of private cover kick in - you will likely be able to get an appointment very quickly (sometimes in a literally days) rather than the lottery of NHS which is usually just as good if not better care, but you may face a wait of weeks or months to see someone. 

The GP will fax or write a letter to the consultant (you might need to check who you can see and let your GP know who to contact after your appointment). You will now need to contact your insurer to let them know that you are making a claim, and who it is with (the consultant you have picked) and the nature of your claim. They will usually accept a referral like this no questions asked, and often will explain exactly what you can do (for example they might say that you can see the consultant, have whatever tests they deem necessary and a follow up appointment, but if you need further treatment or appointments to contact them). They will give you a claim number which is important so write it down! 

When you got to the consultant they will get you to fill in contact details and insurer details (crucially including claim number) and *sometimes* they will ask for a swipe of your credit card in case there is a problem with payments - I don't know how widespread that practice is, and may be avoidable if you contact them in advance. After that you will be treated in a similar manner to NHS and you just need to keep the insurer informed of stuff as it happens (so that they can clear the cost of any new appointments / treatments / tests etc.)

In summary:

1. Normally continue to see your GP as usual
2. If you need a specialist tell your GP you have insurance
3. Work with GP and list of approved hospitals to establish which consultant to see
4. Contact insurer to start a claim
5. Go to appointment (making sure the GP has contacted the consultant up front) with claim number

Advantages:

- it is all about getting to see a consultant quickly - often far quicker than NHS by months
- sometimes the hospitals are a bit nicer, often in respect of food!
- can be less pressures on resources (since everything is claimed for) so you may find it easier to get more speculative tests and treatment

Disadvantages:

- the actual quality of the doctors is the same - many will be both private and NHS consultants, all will have started out in the NHS
- some smaller hospitals may not have all the facilities of larger NHS ones
- emergency care and out of hours care at smaller private hospitals can be weaker due to smaller numbers of staff and less 24:7 nature",0,1412795082,null,0,1412795630,0,cl40nbv,t3_2ion0z,t1_cl40nbv,t3_2ion0z,null,1426622860,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

 I don't think that arguing that those people are losing out is a strong counter argument. What you're pointing out, that it's the English league, is a bit stronger. The nation's league should be played within it (special provisions for the Welsh teams aside). You can also argue how the travel disrupts player training and potentially form and fitness if they're traveling half way across the world for a game mid-season (although that's happens with the international breaks already). To properly orchestrate games abroad you'd have to take extra time off from the normal schedule to accommodate travel times, acclimatization to new places/timezones, etc too.

I'm in the USA and I don't think a match should be played abroad.

- Increases mental health risk esp in ppl w/ family history, but not by much for those without it

- 1 in 10 get psychologically addicted

- Stoned driving doubles chance of accident

- Various other relatively mild and unsurprising health implications.

That said, currently you can't guarantee consistency in quality, even if you're paying a premium and getting it online  (as I'm pretty sure /u/drugsbypost is...) since the supplier can fuck up pretty easily. There's also issues with taking it, since you can risk getting an infection or contract a disease from improper needle use.

...

For a sake of a nicer looking argument I wanted to suppose, anecdotally, that 'one of the heads went the easy route and hired one of their old time 'mates' instead of looking trough talented, newer candidates'... But it doesn't do the absurdly odious matter justice;

I've heard in interviews, from Joss Wheadon, Seth Green and Dan Harmon, amongst others, that though difficult it may initially to believe, female writers just get picked up less often. Dramatically.

As to while this harmful (as I'll keep heavier words to myself) state of things persists, we'd have to look much deeper and in dark and entangled depths of our society's inherent and multi-story problems, but harkening back to my first paragraph;

It's rather a symptom telling of an issue which may well mean that they're not fully tapping the pool of writing talent available to them, as an absolute situation should speak beyond coincidence, and it's a shame that the show is losing on talent and perspective, and that the assumption you've made is likely the last most people will spare upon hearing the news of the sort.

It has the best nightlife in Gloucestershire although that isn't saying much. It has quite a few bars and resturaunts and the good places are usually busy on a weekend but it's a lot quieter than a bigger city. Some of the bars in Montpellier (one of the nicest parts) can be very expensive.

It's been voted the best place in the country to raise a family so there's that as well. The schools are pretty good and there's a fair few places to take young children.",0,1412798120,null,0,false,0,cl42c5g,t3_2iohhp,t1_cl42c5g,t3_2iohhp,null,1426622013,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5

false,Yionx,null,null,"&gt; unspoilt landscape

Unspoilt landscapes barely exist in the UK, unless we are talking about the tops of mountains and stuff.  Hikers are generally not that bothered by paths, sheep, telegraph poles, and grassland where there would naturally be forest - why would they necessarily mind wind turbines?

&gt; Survey data, from various sources, has suggested that tourists would quite seriously not want to go to, and would stop going to, this area.

People really aren't very good at predicting how they would behave in hypothetical situations, though.  Were the people in these surveys well informed about where exactly the wind farms would be and what they would look like?  Would the wind farms be as near to the top of their minds when they are deciding where to go on holiday as when they are answering surveys about wind farms?  It's like how ""would X make you more likely to vote for Y"" questions in political surveys always lead people to overestimate the importance of particular policies in determining how people will vote.

&gt; It's not always just a case of ""NIMBYism"".

But this is literally what NIMBYism is.  People oppose wind farms in their local area purely because of the local problems they might cause, even though the global benefits often outweigh those problems.  There's nothing wrong with taking those local concerns into account, but if they are allowed to dominate everything else, then all kinds of infrastructure could not possibly get built (nobody wants to live next to a factory, power station, or prison, or have a public road or railway built through their property).",0,1412798209,null,0,false,0,cl42dxy,t3_2inh32,t1_cl42dxy,t1_cl3x62n,null,1426621992,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

It's funny how you never hear these concerns from actual electrical engineers or electricity providers.  Wind turbines are erected in places that have more consistent wind than the places where most of us live,  and there will always be some spinning at any given time.  All other energy sources have downtime too, and there has to be spare capacity to deal with unexpected faults or surges in demand anyway.  The unpredictability would start to cause problems if it formed a large enough proportion of the energy mix, but I think we're still a long way from that.

If I recall correctly, onshore wind isn't even that expensive any more.  It can't compete with coal or large hydroelectric dams, but it probably can with nuclear.

&gt; Tidal is more reliable

It's only suitable in a relatively small number of places and tends to have bigger environmental impacts, though.

Of course people who've experienced the PSNI at it's worst will have a negative opinion of them, in the same way that people who've had excellent experiences with the PSNI will have a positive opinion.

On a different aspect of your post though, using the article you posted, of around 500,000 incidents in the 2013/14 financial year, there were 3,734 complaints (and 6,089 allegations), which if my poor math skills are right, means that only %0.7 of all incidents resulted in a complaint. Obviously everyone wants that number to be lower, and certainly wants complaints as a percentage to go down instead of up, but %0.7 to me is still a mighty low number. If my math is correct (which, honestly, it might not be, I'm not 100% confident it is) then that means 99+% of people in this country, who dealt with the police last year, didn't complain, which suggests that the vast majority of people in the country have also not dealth with the PSNI at it's worst, and this subreddit is a reflection of that.

I understand from your post that you have seen the PSNI at their worst, and I hope you did file a complaint, if you didn't then hopefully it hasn't been too long since you witnessed what you did for you to file a complaint. However, that doesn't mean that the PSNI on the whole is bad, and I hope you bear in mind that everyone is human, and humans are imperfect, but it is highly unlikely that the PSNI is entirely forced by the same kind of people who you witnessed being brutal in their treatment of the suicidal homeless person that you mentioned.

I have no idea what to do, I recently started using Freederm Daily Complex in hopes that it will help.

Pretty much all I'm using atm is -
Boots simply sensitive foaming cleansing wash/Olay refreshing face wash
Freederm Daily Complex
Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturiser

For sunscreen, I was using [this](http://www.boots.com/en/Garnier-Ambre-Solaire-Sensitive-Advanced-Very-High-SPF50-200ml_1312641/) but stopped cause I was worried about the alcohol in it (any sunscreen recs? I feel like there's no good ones in the UK!).

I was also using Paula's Choice RESIST Super Antioxidant Concentrate Serum but ran out. I can't buy it again, it's too much but I'm not sure if it did anything anyway? Is it more of a ""preventive"" thing? Definitely want to use a serum though.

 I don't really like the moisturiser I'm using rn, or cleansers, I feel my skin is a bit tight afterwards.

From [this document listing planning applications](http://www.benjamindennehy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Weekly_List_2010_35.doc) in what I presume is week 35 of 2010, we can see that Mr Sohaib Anwar of 80 Noel Road applied for a ""Two storey side and rear extension"" which sounds very likely to be the house in question.

Annoyingly associated documents for the [planning application](http://www.pam.ealing.gov.uk/portal/servlets/ApplicationSearchServlet?PKID=128071) aren't shown to be online.

However, some Googling around yielded [this PDF](http://www.pam.ealing.gov.uk/PlanNet/documentstore%5CDC11115765-14-1_01_A.PDF) from the council, which mentions that at the time both number 80 and the house it's attached to (78) were unaltered, however the unattached neighbouring property had been extended already:
&gt;  It has been extensively altered and extended; with a loft conversion and rear dormer
extension; and a large single storey side and rear extension

The actual plans for number 80 are:
&gt; This current application seeks planning permission for a two-storey side and rear extension,
with a single storey rear infill extension. The two storey extensions would feature a hip roof
design that would match the existing roof. The rear element is stepped down toward the
attached neighbour, with a single storey element infilling the area adjacent to the boundary.

From the images in the PDF, I can see that it's the house part-covered in ivy in this Google Streetview: http://goo.gl/maps/kjuxP

The extension is the entire section to the left of the section that's densely covered in ivy - must've added about half again to the size of the house with the side extension alone, nevermind what got added to the back.  If you divided the side extension into two rooms front and back, upstairs and downstairs, that's another four bedrooms for a start; sacrifice the lounge and that's an eighth, and perhaps whatever's in the extension at the back is the ninth?",0,1412800637,null,0,false,0,cl43r4x,t3_2ioamp,t1_cl43r4x,t1_cl3yrk6,null,1426621353,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

The club was founded in 1878 and we are one of the founders of the Football League including 11 other historic clubs. In the early days and later on we were quite a successful club particularly in the 1950's-1970's where we were known for playing very attacking and attractive football. 

Our main rivals are Wolves which is known as the ""Black Country Derby"". We also have a rivalry with Aston Villa but nowadays is nothing compared to the rivalry with Wolves. As a club we are known for our prominent blue and white striped kits but this season Adidas went for a pinstripe kit. The blue and white stripes will return next year.

Our ground is known as ""The Hawthorns"" and was built in 1900, it is the highest ground out of 92 clubs in the Premier League and English football leagues (Championship-League 2).

Generally in the last 10 years we've been a bit of a yo-yo team, getting promoted, spending a year or 2 in the Premier League then getting relegated. We have been in the Premier League for 4-5 Years now and have done well barring last season. Consecutive 11th, 10th, 8th place finishes and then last season 17th. Last season was very bad for the whole club, lots of things went terribly on and off the pitch.

Currently our squad is probably one of our strongest in years, the board has spent a bit of money and spent quite well. Our longest serving players are midfielders Chris Brunt (Captain), James Morrison, Graham Dorrans and defender Jonas Olsson (Vice-Captain). 

Some of our key players are Ben Foster (England's #2 keeper), Youssouf Mulumbu, Joleon Lescott and young prospect striker Saido Berahino, who looks like he has a very bright future ahead of him for West Brom and England.

Yes, the Oxfam question was directed at you, as it was the most recent work experience on your CV. If you didn't enjoy that role have you looked for other voluntary positions?     

I don't mean to come across as rude, but as an employer, I wouldn't short list your CV as it is, as you have no real work history and no course is going to change that.

Edinburgh already has prepay systems.

The first, Ridacard, is insanely popular. For £17 a week you get unlimited travel on the Buses and trams, especially useful if you use them to commute and/or use multiple services to commute.

The Second, M-Tickets, is a shit load of fuck. It's basically buying tickets on your mobile. Basically you buy a minimum of ten pounds worth of single or day tickets that last you 30 days, at the end of which they get wiped. The app is buggy although it works as a bus tracker app, there are better bus tracker apps on the market.

The third is citysmart. Basically you pay for 10, 20 or 50 single tickets at once. If you are doing more than two journey's it's better to just get a Daysaver.

The fourth is really low tech but fiddly: Dayticket Scratchcards. It's basically a calendar scratchcard. You scratch off the day, month and year on the card and show it to the driver or the conductor when you start your journey.

Each tramstop has a ticket machine where you can buy singles for the tram or Daysavers for the bus or tram.

I think the reason it went well even though you think it wouldn't is to say that it would have gone well anyway. We know humanity will survive, we've seen that. The episode tries to say that no matter what choice a woman makes regarding abortion, it's the right choice. Maybe letting it hatch will destroy the earth = destroy the womans world, but what it really does is open up a whole new beautiful world; space or motherhood. Nice concept, but why the message? There seems to be a theme with moral messages in this season. Why? Doctor Who is not a show made to critique society. It's a silly Sci-Fi show. Does Moffat think he is Henrik Ibsen? I think it is a fine message, and the metaphors are solid, but the medium is as important as the message. Doctor who is not the right medium for this message, and quite frankly the excecution was bad too. 


The problem with these moral messages is that they are forced, and it seems like it's more important to have a message than to not have massive plotholes. 


First, spiderlike onecelled organisms. Bullshit. Second, bug spray. Third, where the fuck did all that mass come from? Fourth, we know the moon has minerals. It's made of rock. How does that much rock just dissappear? The spiders weren't even neccessary to the plot. Neither where the red shirts. 


Also the Clara getting mad at the Doctor is stupid. He has to make decisions like that all the time, remember the space whale episode? When he treats Clara like an equal and gives her responcibility she gets mad. He was probably trying to respond to the Clara-Soldier and Doctor-Officer comparison. Then she bitches about the Doctor not treating humans like equals. He has to make decisions like this all the time, but when Clara, a human, has to she freaks the fuck out. And she even has others to help her! The Doctor is all alone. If humans are equals to the doctor Clara sure isn't. I hope he leaves her and never sees her again. She has made her decidision, and it does not seem like the new doctor's personality to come begging. 




Also how the fuck does THIS show humanity that there is a whole universe outside of Earth? How many bloody alien invasions have there been? The line I am talking about is important to the Pro-Choice analogy, but it just goes to show how poorly it fits in Doctor Who and how it is poorly excecuted. This story could have been a great science fiction story, if it was independant from Doctor Who. 


How did all that rock just disintegrate? Eggs don't do that! I understand that the new moon is a referance to human ""eggs"" in the womb, but it still makes no sense. There should at least be a explaination, like it could've started out small and grown from sun energy, but that clearly didn't happen, as the alien spawned a massive egg.",0,1412802888,null,0,1412803308,0,cl44zvn,t3_2iazo2,t1_cl44zvn,t3_2iazo2,null,1426620703,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

Firstly, Most people have pension plans which are invested in pretty much every industry inevitably including the energy market.

While true (and an important point), that's not the point I was making.

&gt; If wealth is relative, and if everyone is better off, the proportion of people in this particular lower end of the spectrum should not be increasing.

Assuming all wealth increases identically. If the distribution changes, we can see a change in poverty.

The measure of poverty here is just ""the number of people below 60% of the median point"". The question is can we adjust the distribution such that the whole scale moves up but more people fall under this point.

For a simple example, assume a uniform distribution of wealth from 0 to 100 assigned to 100 people. The number in poverty would be 30 (60% of the median value of 50). If we scale this, then the proportion remains the same. Let's do something different with the distribution though, lets increase the poorest 49 people to wealth 50, increase the next two people to wealth 85 and the richest 49 people to wealth 101. Everyone is better off here, in that they have a greater wealth. However, our median is now 85 and the poverty line is 51. We have *more* people in poverty, but everyone has greater wealth.

We can also create something where *almost* all people have more, but the total amount remains the same. Since the median point is unaffected by the amounts most people have, and is only defined by the wealth of the person right in the middle, we could alter the first example to have a much richer ""upper class"", even a single person. The total wealth in the second example is 7569, so we could have the first 99 people having 0 to 99 wealth and the posh boy with 2599 wealth. The posh person would lose out, so technically not everyone would gain but it would be a fairer distribution with more people with greater wealth but *more poverty given this definition*.

This isn't a slight against the definition, it seems fairly sensible. All measures like this will be flawed.",0,1412806621,null,0,false,0,cl46x2h,t3_2ib9w2,t1_cl46x2h,t1_cl448dy,null,1426619806,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

NFL fans complained and still complain about the London game, having games on Thursday night, some of the recent rule changes,  etc etc. It doesn't really matter and for the most part our voices changed little. It's a business and having a game in London and on Thursday night created new revenue steams. So they did it...and we still watch (as they knew we would) because we love the game and our team.

It's kind of different for the NFL I'll grant you as they have a very generous revenue sharing set up between teams as well as a salary cap. So the new revenue is shared among teams equally so a couple teams can't hog the money and buy all the talent. Makes it easier to swallow.

Deeson's is on Sun Street opposite La Trappiste. The food is upmarket and of good quality. Markets itself as a 'British' restaurant. Eaten there once, more set menu style and expensive but pleasent.

false,cpitchford,null,null,"I recon its the hardware they use to block sites.

Back in the good old days, ISPs used information from the IWF to block certain dodgy sites from the internet. These sites were blackholed, meaning users simply couldn't connect.

Later, the sites were filtered using much more expensive equipment. Any traffic destined to the IP address(es) of the site were transparently filtered through these systems to see if you were trying to access something blacklisted, or if you were safe. This allowed part or parts of sites to be blocked. ([Like when a particular wikipedia page was banned](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/dec/09/wikipedia-iwf-ban-lifted))

Now, the arses in government decided that ALL internet traffic should be subject to blocks to protect the children. This means ISPs now need fucking huge systems that monitor and block massive lists... The number of adult websites is likely a million times larger than the IWF block list.

So, now we're in a situation that although we may have opted-out of the this rediculous filter, for imgur we're still relying on the same filtering system. It just so happens that this system is overloaded probably due to the massive file sizes..

for example, they may be blocking specific hashes of images on imgur (say celebrity images recently?) which may mean the filter must download the entire image from imgur, produce the hash and if it fails to make a blocked digest, send it to the customer.

This particular analysis is expensive computationally... it's hard for the systems to do millions of these compares at the same time. If imgur is serving 10000 hits a second, that could be eating a significant proportion of the blocking capacity.

I'm guessing that the filters have two methods of operation when at capacity. For adult sites that might be blockable to protect the children, meh... if you're flat out ""fail open"" and let a request through unfiltered... However, for an address on the IWF, if there's no capacity left in the filter then drop the request...

This might explain why 4 out of every 5 requests to the imgur IP for me times out.


It might also be a factor of the way Fastly's CDN is built. They run the IP address that you connect to when browsing imgur.com. The fault *might* be at their end, maybe affecting one of their nodes... but I'd have hoped they'd know about it now

I wish I could make this post (linked below) required reading before the thread could be unlocked for anyone new who shows up.  There are a few comments about statistics, but this is really the best in the thread I think.  It doesn't prove me right or anyone else wrong, other than to demonstrate that making a conclusion based on one number might be pretty suspect.

&gt; The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (Irish: Cumann Chearta Sibhialta Thuaisceart Éireann) was an organisation which campaigned for civil rights in Northern Ireland during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Formed in Belfast on 9 April 1967, the civil rights campaign attempted to achieve reform by publicising, documenting, and lobbying for an end to abuses in areas such as housing, unfair electoral procedures, discrimination in employment and the Special Powers Act. **The genesis of the organisation lay in a meeting in Maghera in August 1966 between the Wolfe Tone Societies which was attended by Cathal Goulding, then chief of staff of the IRA.** The hope of the IRA, which four years earlier had ceased military operations after the failure of its Border Campaign, was that out of the already-nascent civil rights movement in Northern Ireland begun in 1963-4 by the Homeless Citizens' League and the Campaign for Social Justice there would arise a campaign of civil disturbance which would assist its efforts to unseat the unionist government in Belfast, and that the creation of NICRA would enable it to direct that campaign's course. Although socialist republicans and one IRA member were among those involved in the creation of NICRA, the IRA did not direct it.^[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Civil_Rights_Association)

For further information about the initial meeting of the NICRA in Maghera;

&gt; NICRA itself originated at a conference of the Wolfe Tone Societies held in Maghera, County Derry, on the weekend of 13-14 August 1966. The societies had been created in 1964 out of the committees which were set up to organise the 1963 commemorations of the bicentenary of the birth of Wolfe Tone, the leader of the United Irishmen and martyr of the 1798 Rising. Their 'primary objective was a united, independent and democratic Irish Republic in accordance with the principles of the 1916 Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil'. Fred Heatley described them as 'an autonomous adjunct of the Republican Movement', and Roy Johnston called them 'a Fabian Society to the Republican Movement'.

&gt; The republicans were active in influencing the direction taken by NICRA as well as in its creation. Goulding himself was present at the Wolfe Tone Societies meeting in Maghera in 1966. To understand the significance of their involvement, however, and the direction in which republican influence took the civil rights movement, it is necessary to examine carefully the political strategy of the republicans in the mid-1960s. The abandonment of the 1956-62 IRA military campaign was highly ambiguous and from outward appearances it was possible to interpret republican actions as either preparation for a renewed onslaught or as a delicate operation to keep the movement together while its direction was fundamentally changed.
&gt; 
**Politics in the Streets:The origins of the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland by Bob Purdie (1990)** ^[Source](http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/crights/purdie.htm)

The IRA strategy was to mobilize people around social issues, but steered clear of directly controlling organisations it had helped create. Nobody said the NICRA had a military wing, that is precisely the point, peaceful demonstrations where met with the full force of the state. The Level of violence unleashed shocked even the IRA who were ill prepared for such an eventuality, in fact it split over what to do in response.

It was Bloody Sunday that led a vast bulk of people to leave join the newly formed PIRA. The swansong of the NICRA was a march directly after Bloody Sunday in which 100,000 people attended; it was the last thing they ever really did. 

&gt; Despite such attempts to continue civil disobedience, the civil-rights movement floundered during 1971 and 1972. In January 1972 British soldiers attacked a peaceful demonstration, killing 13 civilians in what became known as ""Bloody Sunday"". NICRA organised a protest in response, in which over 100,000 people took part. This was, however, to be the organisation's last significant march; Bloody Sunday had “immobilised NICRA from returning to the streets”. As clashes escalated, London suspended the Northern Ireland parliament. This marked the end of the civil-rights movement and street politics. The Provisional IRA emerged as the dominant force within the movement, and Irish nationalism became the foremost political position for those seeking radical social change.

As for People's Democracy who where much more radical than NICRA they had various splits, some Becoming the Left Revolutionary Group then the Red Republican Party, they were actively involved in the Internment and prisoners Rights campaigns and later the Anti H-Block campaigns. Some of them actively sought to dissolve the group and outright join Sinn Fein, they of course like many leftist groups split. With a lot leaving to join the newly organised shinners but what was left was a tiny rump who renamed themselves Socialist Democracy.

&gt; PD was especially active around the issues of internment and prisoners' rights. Following the formation of the National H-Block/Armagh Committee in 1979 to build support for the Republican prisoners then on the ""blanket protest"" in support of political status and the subsequent death of Bobby Sands and nine of his comrades during the H-Block hunger strikes, a number of members of the organisation, led by Vincent Doherty - then a member of the Political Committee and a former party general election candidate - argued that PD should join Sinn Féin, which had moved openly to the left in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
&gt; 
&gt; In 1981, two members of People's Democracy were elected to Belfast City Council. John McAnulty and Fergus O'Hare were elected in a joint campaign with the IRSP. Fergus O'Hare won the council seat of Gerry Fitt, a sitting Westminster MP. O'Hare had been a founding member of the National H-Block/Armagh Committee and had previously been chairperson of the Political Hostages Release Committee which spearheaded the campaign against internment in the early 1970s. 
&gt; 
&gt; When Sinn Féin ended its boycott of elections and gained mass support among the republican community, PD entered a political crisis. From 1982 on, a number of activists left them and joined Sinn Féin. At a PD national conference in 1986, a group including Anne Speed proposed the dissolution of the group and that the members all join SF as individuals. This position was defeated by 19 votes to five. A few weeks later the minority of five resigned from PD followed by their supporters and joined Sinn Féin. The remaining rump who continued to oppose this view maintained PD as a small propaganda group.
&gt; 
&gt;  In the early 1990s the remaining members of PD initiated the Irish Committee for a Marxist Programme as an attempt to regroup socialists and left wing republicans. This project ended in 1996, when PD dissolved and reconstituted itself as Socialist Democracy, adopting the program put forward by the ICMP. ^[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Democracy_%28Ireland%29)


Here are some of the personal recollections of Peter Cosgrove (Peoples Democracy Member)
 
&gt;  The struggle for “Civil Rights” was intended to change this state of affairs.  The “Civil Rights” movement covered a multiplicity of Catholic nationalists, republicans, communists and ordinary decent human beings who actually believed in “Civil Rights”.
&gt; 
&gt; It seemed clear to me that trying to march from Belfast to Derry would cause problems for the Orange State.   So, I swaggered up Royal Avenue on 1 January, 1969.
&gt; We were a motley crew as we set off up Royal Avenue.  Gery Lawless, Ireland’s best known Trotskyist had come over from London.  So too had Bowes Egan, a writer and publisher.  Rita O’Hare, later to become a well-known republican was there.  So was Johnny Morrissey from Tipperary.  None of these folk were students. There were students on the march but they were probably outnumbered by graduates and people with no university background.
&gt; 
&gt; We were preceded by a posse of Unionists waving the Union Jack. They were led by Major Bunting who was, at the time, Dr Paisley’s right-hand man.  Oddly enough, the Major’s son, Ronnie who later became a prominent member of the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) was on the march.

I think this is substantially overdoing it.
