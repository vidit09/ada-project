Bear in mind as well, each time the license is issued or renewed an individual policeman has to go to that person's house and have a meeting. I imagine the travel costs for that are considerable.

There was an idea to make licenses last longer but cost the individual more but that causes issues with not checking up on the license holder regularly.

true,Subotan,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"1. In the short term the costs and effects of leaving the EU are at best mixed, but the point is that in the long term - as in, forty, fifty, sixty years from now - it will leave us with lower living standards, and isolated and unable to protect our interests abroad. Free trade (and by extension, further economic integration) doesn't make everyone a winner, but it improves economic efficiency and output for the economy as a whole over the long term.

2. There are elements of people involved in the EU who see the appeal of a Federal Europe (including myself), but that doesn't mean that the nation-state will be left powerless in my vision of a federal Europe. I'm a big believer in subsidiarity, the idea that things in Europe should be done at the lowest level feasibly possible, but I also believe that the EU needs more democracy in the form of an elected European government. Other things such as foreign policy would be no-brainers to do on a European level were it not for Germany's squeamishness and free-riders like Ireland, Austria, Sweden and Finland mooching off the money France and Britain spend on defence. Other things like healthcare, education, policing, national environmental policies, generic public services etc. are no brainers to run on the nation-state level. A limited European government and a more democratic Europe aren't only compatible, they're necessary for the theory of a Federal Europe to be consistent - it's for this reason that saying that Europe is just going to snatch more and more power from the nation state is misleading.

3. For decades it wasn't so much a ""Great Deception"" (really? *really*?) as that the European public simply wasn't interested in Europe. That has now changed, but leaving Europe and putting policy in the hands of unelected delegates and lobbyists seems like a weaker solution to me than more democracy in the EU.

4. I'll give you that Farage has been consistent, but it's not fair to say that that's because he's ""right"". He's consistent because it's a simple, digestable message which is easy to communicate in a poor economy.

&gt; But those are forgivable I believe in my current estimation of him especially as they are bending rules not breaking them

People did not grant MPs the same mercy wrt their expenses. This aspect reveals the crux of Farage's appeal.

The reason why people like Farage is because he's like them. He's not an overly manicured, tieless, bland, focus group-obsessed blancmange. He is sharp, he does come from a non-political background (even if it is City Finance), and he is charismatic. In these respects, he's a complete vindication of British democracy. He's shown that it is possible to attract electoral support whilst not being a member of the middle-manager elite. It's a shame he's not a member of any of the main parties, but then he never would have risen far in any of them even if he'd had the right values and beliefs.

In terms of policy though? It's inconsistent rubbish. People aren't actually voting for UKIP's policies or even about Europe, they're voting for Farage and against foreigners. ",0,1398254782,null,0,false,0,cgztv7y,t3_23qyez,t1_cgztv7y,t1_cgzt4t4,null,1433482834,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

They don't want to pay for training, they want the driver to pay for it. You're looking at around £5000 to get someone to driving an artic from holding just a car license which very few people can afford to pay.

There's the recently (2010??) introduced mandatory periodic training, the Driver CPC. Whilst drivers who'd had their HGV license before 2009 were exempt from it until September this year they're all going to have it and without it they cannot work as a driver. The numbers going through training centres suggests that most of the haulage sector is burying their head in the sand or hoping the driver will pay for it out of their own pocket at £400 plus a week's lost wages.

I know quite a few antifa. It's a mixed bag - mostly decent people, some kids that are a bit too feisty. Obviously there's dipshits that take stuff too far and lob bottles for no reason which is dumb, but most people here turn up to demonstrate that racist thugs are not welcome in our town, and protect other protesters from EDL cunts who try and sneak round the back to hurt people (despite there being families etc. present), generally by chasing them off.

I'm not a huge fan of big organisations, and the UAF, being a SWP (ick) spin-off is not always popular with a lot of antifa demonstrators (who have pacifist and anarchist leanings). That said, stopping fascism is a good thing, and I've met a few UAF guys who are pretty sound.

I hope you're right, I'd like to believe that success in this league has to be maintained through the youth academy, rather than poaching the best players from smaller teams. The Spurs comparison is a great point, but I think United are at the same point now as England were during the last WC. Having lost the golden generation, they now need to shift out the dead weight and bring in new blood.

I can believe that they will get enough decent players in to challenge for 4th, even if the title seems far-fetched right now.

Talk about sidestepping the argument.  You cannot argue about ""Christian values"" applicable over 1500 years, if those values have changed; and you belong to a sect that rejected it's own contemporary Christian values.  I'll do you the favour of assuming you can grasp that concept, and are deliberately sidestepping it. 

&gt;Not a pedantic game at all. It's what you claimed, and it's what I corrected you on. Too bad baby doesn't like it, and is now trying to move the goalposts until he can score.

Not at all, I admitted the veracity of what you said.  However, the fact that you think that a technicality about which ""heretical"" text ownership people were burned alive for, ""wins"" an argument *is* pedantic and pretty sad. Score one for Christ eh?

&gt;As I've already pointed out, it was a period of massive state and social upheaval, and if you really think that Sir Thomas More (Lord Chancellor of England and noted Renaissance Humanist, btw) really burned people purely out of religious zeal

Purely or no, he had them tortured and burned as heretics; he saw Protestants as enemies in a war.  He acted upon religious grounds.  I understand Christians don't like things like this; but the fact is if you want to talk about the history of Christianity, you are going to spend a lot of time talking about evil wankers doing things in the name of Christ.

Well that's not as clear cut as you make it seem. 

Democracy isn't black and white, people have to decide for themselves how democratic they feel the system is. 

Personally I can understand how people would feel the EU system is not democratic enough. Having just one vote out of 28, and having no say in who the other 27 members who make the decision are does not seem very democratic. After all, only one of those 28 has made any promise to me or you that they will commit themselves to making things better for the people of the UK. The rest prioritise their own voters, as you would expect. So now you are in a situation where one person is voting based on what is best for you, and the other 27 are voting on what is best for someone else. 

Also, what do you do about countries block voting. Some countries have priorities which are more line line with each other, some countries will vote tactically, just like in any election. Is that fair and democratic.

Finally, how do the elections take place, are they free and open, where the discussions are broadcast like in the house of commons? Nope, the elections take place behind closed doors, hidden away, similar to how they elect the pope.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;How deep does that go? This is a public forum - not scientific research.

This is an answer along the lines of 'it's common sense' when asked for proof. There's no need for a dissertation on it.

&gt;I should be able to expect a minimum amount of research from the person asking the questions.

And so should they - but (in this case) he's not the one making assertions based on popular opinion, is he?

&gt;In the case of the person you're defending - that just didn't happen.

No, because he wasn't making assertions/ assumptions - you were. He just asked questions which you decided not to answer.

&gt;If you're going to do that it would be prudent to also mention factors discussed in the years that followed the invasion

Your statements appear to be based on those already, hence my pointing out that ignoring the *preceding* factors can't be dismissed because they can then cast subsequent events in a much different light.

&gt;from power in the region to the increasing number of cartoonists making snide jabs at Bush and Blair being oil hungry.

And yet it was France, with their already-signed oil contracts, who blocked further U.N. resolutions. So one could legitimately argue that it was *France* being oil-hungry that stalled the U.N. and led to the Iraq invasion. That's just one example of a preceding factor, easily verifiable, that completely changes the 'popular' outlook. But that doesn't sell newspapers, which is why a lot of the 'popular' commentary should be taken as just that.

&gt;Dismissing it all because I haven't the time to write about it seems nonsensical.

In which case, don't make statements that you 'don't have time' to back up.

true,the_ultravixens,null,null,"I'm sometimes quite sceptical about the trying to turn economics into one of the hard sciences, especially when it comes to using ""big data"".  I mean, the reason that certain methods work in regards to, say, physics is that it's possible to simplify and abstract most things in physics in such a way that you can realistically model or measure just a few key properties, which should allow you to accurately predict what will happen in similar situations.  Economics is pretty much the opposite.  You've got all these maddeningly complex systems, and it's very difficult to break down the complexity, since it's hard to know what factors you can and can't ignore.  Then there's the issue of data, there are only certain things you can measure economically, yet how do you know they're the important data points?  I know I'm basically paraphrasing von Hayek's nobel acceptance speech, but I don't think that the points he raised have ever really been addressed.  In fact I'd argue that people doing the exact opposite of the ideas expressed in that speech were a big cause in the last financial crash.  In all honesty, I think we expect too much of economics.  I don't think it will ever be like physics, with great predictive powers and uncanny accuracy.  Maybe it should be thought of a bit more like biology, more descriptive than predictive.

And as for big data, I don't know how exciting it is.  Lots of people who seem really into it are making a lot of claims that are borderline religious.

Even if the nuclear reactor was on a French beach such an exclusion zone wouldn't even reach our shores, let alone London.

Such a load of FUD. Size has nothing to do with it. Chernobyl won't happen again.. It was an archaic reactor design that was staffed by nuclear sub operators who had no idea how to manage it. It was a complete failure of procedure and technology which we've since learned from.

LOL! Do me another favour and point how citing *The Bible* is sidestepping a debate on Christian values. The only person who thinks there is inconsistency here is you, and that's purely because of your own ignorance.

&gt; Not at all, I admitted the veracity of what you said.

No you didn't. You attempted to broaden the argument to include *all* burnings, and acted like I was defending them all.

&gt; Score one for Christ eh? 

Score one for anyone who can see through your bullshit.

&gt; Purely or no, he had them tortured and burned as heretics; he saw Protestants as enemies in a war. He acted upon religious grounds.

So you acknowledge that it was a political act, and then state it was purely based on religion. Righto.

&gt;  I understand Christians don't like things like this

TIL all Christians think the same thing.

&gt; the fact is if you want to talk about the history of Christianity, you are going to spend a lot of time talking about evil wankers doing things in the name of Christ. 

You'll be doing that if you talk about history in general. What makes Christianity so special? Oh, that's right, it's convenient to your argument.

Oh my good such naivety. Have you ever thought its because victors write history and the victims generally don't? In the village my family originally comes from, people still remember the Empire as an utterly brutal and throughly evil thing. As a child I would still see some of the scars left behind. Like an old woman who couldn't speak because she had her throat cut as a child. Her father got the mad idea that the Empire had no right to rule them, tax them or steal their land. Since they couldn't get him, soldiers decided to rape and murder his wife and daughters and then dump their bodies in the middle of nowhere. She was lucky to be found alive by travellers. 

Did you think the Empire lasted for such a long time because the majority of people were happy being subservient? No, it's because they knew if they rebelled the reprisals would have been utterly brutal and they would have been decimated. I don't hate the UK or British people since I obviously live here. However to say that the Empire was a good thing is an incredibly insulting and naive. It's a dark chapter in British history and for the rest of the world it was their lowest point.

true,CNash85,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"But you could make the same arguments about the UK's own system of government. Each MP is supposed to represent the interests of his or her constituents; they've committed to make things better for the people of their constituency, prioritising their own voters. It's only the grouping of MPs into parties that forces them to look after the interests of the country in general, rather than going strictly by what their voters want.

To be honest, I'm not sure whether this is a good or bad thing. On one hand you don't want your MP to just use you as a vehicle by which they attain power - you want them to care about your issues, and if they're whipped into voting for something you disagree with, then I think you're entitled to feel aggrieved. But then, if every MP pursued the agenda of their constituents to the exclusion of all else, without devoting time to policies on a national level, we wouldn't have a cohesive system of government.

Anyway, I've gone a bit off topic here, but to boil it down: I can understand why people don't like that we only have a few voices in the EU... but then isn't that the point, that nobody has any greater or lesser of a say in how the organisation operates, to promote fairness? It seems to me that the ""undemocratic"" argument isn't really about the amount of influence the UK has in the EU, but a general rejection of the notion that any other country should have any influence over the UK.

You also made a point about tactical voting - I'll concede that that may be an issue, but it's not fair to paint the EU as a bunch of bullies ganging up on the poor, isolated UK. (Nor, for that matter, is it fair to immediately distrust the decisions made by the EU - to immediately focus on the negatives before considering why the decision was made and what positive effects it could have. But that's another argument.) We're perfectly capable of using tactical or block voting ourselves; we are not culturally or politically isolated from the rest of Europe.",0,1398259138,null,0,false,0,cgzv2za,t3_23qyez,t1_cgzv2za,t1_cgzun8z,null,1433483408,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,TJP343,null,null,"This is going to go nowhere, but I completely disagree with you, creativity in the middle third of the pitch in possession is not overly important, it is far more important when in the opponent's final third, the last phase of possession when the team is looking for incision into the opponent's area.

The first and second phase of possession, starting from the back and moving through the middle third is much more about recycling possession, keeping the ball moving, players moving into and out of space, proper positioning and spacing to beat any sort of press being put on by the opponent, it is about controlling the ball and not losing it. Taking players on off the dribble and playing risky passes from further back doesn't provide the immediate return of getting into goal scoring areas that it does in the final third. And loss of possession in the middle third or defensive third is risky and invites fast paced counter attacks from close to the possession team's goal.

If you look at typical, effective, deep lying midfield players, you find players like Lahm and Daley Blind(Ajax), Matic with Chelsea, players who can play a dedicated defensive role but can also play a high rate of passes safely close to their own goal, they act as a conduit to move the ball from flank to flank or up and down the team lines with the idea of moving possession forward, but doing so in a risk adverse manner.

The other type of deep lying midfielder is the Pirlo role, being played by Gerrard with Liverpool in their diamond and the master himself with Juventus in a 3-1-4-2, they are not fantastic defenders but they are protected by a hard working midfield and look to move possession forward with long but accurate passes in the first two phases of possession and then look for the killer pass in the final possession phase.

Dembele does not have these qualities, he is not an effective long range passer, there are few players who can play the Pirlo role. Nor is he a strong defensive midfielder in either his positioning, discipline or tackling. And when he decides to skip forward on the ball he may move possession forward 20-30 yards and may it look nice but he is vacating his defensive position and also slowing down the speed of the buildup, a 20-30 pass is always faster than a player dribbling 20-30 yards across the same area(unless it's Bale). 

Barcelona and Ajax do not beat opposition presses and retain high amounts of possession in the middle third to gain entry into the final third in an organized manner by having players take on others off the dribble from deep. Liverpool does not counter attack effectively by having someone pick up the ball in midfield and dribble through everyone.

Dembele's quality to beat a player off the dribble makes far more sense to be used in a wide area, where further forward, he has an ability to challenge the opponent's fullback, who if he beats he is now in behind the defense in a very threatening area. And if he concedes possession in these areas he is 80-90 yards away from his own goal, not 40-50.

Discipline, positioning, the interchanging of positions and high rate of passing moves is what allows possession based teams to advance from a goal kick situation into the opponent's final third. Dembele does not possess these qualities. ",0,1398259160,null,0,false,0,cgzv38i,t3_23omxr,t1_cgzv38i,t1_cgztiqc,null,1433483411,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,Subotan,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"Obviously economists aren't in the business of fortune telling, but that's what economic theory predicts. Either we keep opening our borders, physical and abstract, within Europe and reaping the benefits, or we become a closed economy and see stagnation.

&gt;What is clear is that joining the EEA, there is very little difference to our current Single Market access without the political union. The political CHANGE is huge however.

Which then raises the question of the political trade-off of ""sovereignty"" vs. ""influence"". I'm firmly in the latter camp, as I believe there is still a lot of potential for European democracy and that the Eurosceptic claim that there is no European *demos* is rather lame.

&gt;Referendums

And yet the EU has listened. The Constitution was scrapped, and aspects of Lisbon that worried the Irish were amended by Brussels (abortion comes to mind).

The problem with referendums on specific treaty questions is that they've historically become second-order national contests, plebiscites on the population's approval of the government. Given that these treaties are negotiated between 28 different national governments, there's very little that can actually be changed in the event of a failed referendum - that 95% of Lisbon was identical to the EU Constitution is proof of this, whether you're Eurosceptic or not.

The issue is that rejection isn't an alternative. It's stagnation. Lisbon has made the EU significantly more democratic than it was, as the EU Constitution would have been, but I doubt that most if any people who voted against either disliked the idea of more democracy in Europe. I would prefer a singular contest for this reason in countries where the EU is unpopular - In/Out rather than Yes/No.

&gt;And the fact in the UK the Pro-EU's never talk up the Pro-EU case for fear of revealing how much power has been transferred.

 Eh? I'm pro-EU and I'm speaking up for it right now. I mentioned earlier about what kind of powers I would like to see transferred and vice versa.

&gt;Farage has been consistent that there is a democratic deficit with the EU for 40 years there has been deception over the EU and no vote over the EU and lies over the EU.

 Farage has been consistent in his behaviour, but he's linking two very different arguments. One is that European integration is a bad thing for this country - not an argument I agree with. The other is that there is a democratic deficit in the EU, which I very much do agree with. The logical conclusion to the former is not a solution to the latter.

true,grotesquelyuglyfreak,flair7,,"I disagree with you on many points but find it hard to get across in words how I feel you play the defensive playmaker/recycler properly. You seem to think that a fast transition from defence to attack is important, yet seem to pretend like our other DM's are better passers than Dembele, they're not. Their control of the ball is too poor to get themselves set to play a pass, Dembele's the only one with the ball control to be able to position his body to play a pass through the midfield. 

&gt; Taking players on off the dribble and playing risky passes from further back doesn't provide the immediate return of getting into goal scoring areas that it does in the final third. And loss of possession in the middle third or defensive third is risky and invites fast paced counter attacks from close to the possession team's goal.
&gt; 

I totally agree with this, I just think you'll find that Dembele gets dispossessed in the middle/first third of the pitch less than Sandro, Capoue, Bentaleb and Paulinho. Despite making more risks, he's got such superior control that he's just so much less likely to get dispossesed than them. So from that you have a player in Dembele who's getting dispossessed less than the other options and is playing more important forward passes and getting the ball forward faster, quicker and more often than the other midfielders. He's literally so much better than the others at getting the ball forward and being on the ball than the other options.

You seem to be cutting the roles a bit thin into how you say one can play defensive midfielder (playmaker) but I've got to say I disagree than Dembele's dribbling is bad, it allows our midfield to stay composed when pressed as he is able to maintain possession where our other midfielders get dispossessed (in dangerous areas) and as a result the other team will step off and Dembele's superior ball control allows him to get the ball, pick a pass through midfield and find the attackers. He takes players on out of necessity, he doesn't look to take them on it's just that the other players aren't making the right run or whatever and so the best option is for him to beat his man and pick someone out. And whilst he's playing alongside Sandro it won't be a probem for him to vacate his position to take the ball forward.

&gt; Discipline, positioning, the interchanging of positions and high rate of passing moves is what allows possession based teams to advance from a goal kick situation into the opponent's final third. Dembele does not possess these qualities.

He has all those qualities. Maybe not to the extent of Modric, but more than Bentaleb, Capoue, Sandro and Paulinho. And I disagree with you that the role of DM is only limited to players with those attributes, but even under your attributes he's still the best player for the job (IMO).

You were correct when you said this was going to go nowhere because for me Dembele's at least in the top 5 midfielders in the premierleague if not top 3 and he's being completely wasted at spurs.

edit: I'll add that I think Dembele is severely under-rated here, in particular his passing, but also his defensive abilities which I'd put on a par with Capoue and above Paulinho.",0,1398260595,null,0,1398261324,0,cgzvkzr,t3_23omxr,t1_cgzvkzr,t1_cgzv38i,null,1433483644,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

From Wiki, but since its not political I don't think its to bad to use it in this instance:

""Established by the USSR military soon after the 1986 disaster, it **initially** existed as an area of 30-kilometre radius from the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant...

**The Exclusion Zone covers an area of approximately 2,600 km2 (1,000 sq mi) in Ukraine immediately surrounding the Chernobyl nuclear power plant where radioactive contamination from fallout is highest and public access and inhabitation are restricted.** ""

That exclusion zone is big enough for wolf packs to have their ranges within the the zone. There was even a documentary done on it, I know since I watched it.

&gt; Even if the nuclear reactor was on a French beach such an exclusion zone wouldn't even reach our shores, let alone London.

There are area's in Wales that have sheep farms that still require testing for radioactivity due to soil contamination from Chernobyl. The soil was thin enough that the radioactivity had no where to move to.  If the radioactive fallout can hit Wales from the Ukraine then it can and will hit from France to London.  

&gt; Such a load of FUD. Size has nothing to do with it. Chernobyl won't happen again.. It was an archaic reactor design that was staffed by nuclear sub operators who had no idea how to manage it. It was a complete failure of procedure and technology which we've since learned from.

* Don't expect the Kemlyn Road stand or the Kop to get expanded anytime soon. Both a bit more difficult than the other two stands - I read one expert say that they would essentially have to tear down the Kemlyn Road stand as expanding on it would be very difficult. 

* Saying that, FSG will see how demand is after the Main Stand and Anfield Road developments and then consider filling in the corners of the stadium. 

* Old bastards and history twats (both affectionate terms) may notice that the structure on top of the new Main Stand is a bit like [the old Kop.](http://i.imgur.com/4OQrtGi.jpg) Some see it, some don't.

I should also point out that the image I have posted is legitimate, but also from an early design stage (Stage C).

true,TurkishWaiter,cnty-wales,"Wales via Lincs, Oxford &amp; Essex","This practice has become the norm for so many industries. A former colleague of mine works for a company which installs broadband services on behalf of BT. He is classified as self employed, which means he has to pay an umbrella company to organise his pay. He's not allowed to do his own pay-cheque accounting, he has to use a specific umbrella company to get the job, which is a sister company of the one he contracts for. The terms are atrocious, he gets paid £15 per fibre broadband installation, yet £2.50 for each job is charged by the umbrella company. 

As he is self employed, he has no guarantee of work but he does have a van and tools provided. Being self employed, you'd think he'd have flexibility regarding his own working hours, but the contract includes penalties if you do not work, as you have a company vehicle in your possession, so for example if you were to call in sick on a Monday morning, or refuse to travel 100+ miles to get to your jobs the company charge £75 per day due to a fleet vehicle not being in use.

No holiday pay, no sick pay, no termination rights and even though he pays an umbrella company he still has to complete a tax self assessment as any normal self employed person would. It's not just the engineers in the field on these terms, many of the area mangers also have self employed status, but as they don't get paid per job, they're paying a flat monthly fee to the umbrella company.

I *could* inform the person you were talking to, but I got the impression that he was actually trying to inform *you* by allowing you to reach a conclusion yourself, unless you had info to the contrary (which is, after all, one of the ways we learn things), at which point you demanded he do it for himself - which is a bit of a cop out and reflects on your willingness to soundbite but not back up your assumptions (which I thought worth pointing out - there are already too many redditors who are happy to abuse tabloids and then act like they write for them).

Nobody is going to argue that the UK/ US invaded - I don't really remember that being contested (or why it would be) - but discussions still continue *generally* around the whys and wherefores, and your apparent conclusion that the most popular outlook must be the right is false, so your statements need vindication with facts and context - it is, after all, the fact that the subject is arguable from both sides that's part of the reason it's still a topic now; however, claims like 'Blair is a war criminal' do nothing other that belie a specific take on the subject, rather than demonstrate the why, or even how a claim like that can be legitimate - Blair could quite easily list the factors that informed his decision, and has done so on several occasions. It's easy to find a lawyer who will say X - but that doesn't mean much if they're not prepared to pursue it, suggesting that the people who highlight that issue simply want their agenda legitimised instead of it actually meaning anything. And sure, the natives will be jaded - but that's after the insurgencies and so on that happened after Saddam was toppled - they were happy enough to get rid of him, so can you categorically state that *less* natives would have been killed in the civil war that would have been required to remove SH (and all the family he had placed in positions of power) under their own steam?

[Better off out of the EU -- Norwegian Centre Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8GpzDDurR8)

&gt;*and that the Eurosceptic claim that there is no European demos is rather lame.*

Factually correct: There is no EU demos.

&gt;*The Constitution was scrapped, and aspects of Lisbon that worried the Irish were amended by Brussels (abortion comes to mind).*

* *""As for the changes now proposed to be made to the constitutional treaty, most are presentational changes that have no practical effect. They have simply been designed to enable certain heads of government to sell to their people the idea of ratification by parliamentary action rather than by referendum.""* — Dr Garret FitzGerald, former Irish Taoiseach, 123

* *""There’s nothing from the original institutional package that has been changed.""* — Astrid Thors, Finnish Europe Minister, TV-Nytt, 23rd June 2007

* *""They haven't changed the substance - 90 per cent of it is still there.""* — Bertie Ahern, Irish Prime Minister, Irish Independent, 24th June 2007

* *""In terms of content, the proposals remain largely unchanged, they are simply presented in a different way... The reason is that the new text could not look too much like the constitutional treaty.""* — Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, former French President and Chairman of the Convention which drew up the EU Constitution, addressing the Constitutional Affairs Committee in the European Parliament, 17th July 2007

* *""The good thing about not calling it a Constitution is that no one can ask for a referendum on it.""* — Giuliano Amato, former Italian Prime Minister and Vice-Chairman of the Convention which drew up the Constitution, speech to the London School of Economics, 20th February 2007

&gt;*Given that these treaties are negotiated between 28 different national governments, there's very little that can actually be changed in the event of a failed referendum*

This is why a political union won't practically work and is unnecessary and why eg Norway has MORE influence paradoxically out of the EU than in it. The system Treaties is flawed where no reform for the realities of particular countries in history, culture, society, politics, law, religion, geography and economy cannot be reconciled. It's too diverse.

&gt;*Lisbon has made the EU significantly more democratic*

Has led to the formation of the Federal USE = Centralization which is contrary to Direct Democracy eg Switzerland which is outside the Eu has had a referendum voted on by the people on EU-immigration. You won't see that in the UK in the EU despite 77% oppose no controls.

Tbh, I'm responding out of courtesy to your fairly put questions: Given the original parent post has been downvoted to oblivion (as usual in reddit) I am not sure it makes much more sense to further this conversation. But thanks anyway for reading. :)

Your wording implied that interpretation.  Not really my mistake. 

&gt;The turmoils during the reformation were as much political as they were religious

Say it's political all you like.  More himself says that he does what he does in the name of religion.  Gainsay that all you like, you're arguing with a dead guy.  Bet you don't go around defending Islamists by saying, yeah well, all they want is a second Caliphate.  It's all *political* you know.  Nothing to do with their religious convictions.

&gt;Ah yes, the noted anti-Catholic polemicist 

Ah yes, a man of *sense*.  Let's not listen to him at all.  Let's not believe More either, but let's revise shit so so we don't have to actually deal with the fact that religion is a huge problem to humanity.

&gt;You know theology is the study of religion, right? You know it's a legitimate field of study, right? You know you can still get a degree in it, right?

Yeah, alchemy was a legitimate field of study too.  Doesn't mean it wasn't all bullshit.  As I said, you're studying fairies, just with fancy names.  That's not wasted human effort at all.  Anyone who tries to ""prove"" anything with Theology isn't worth listening to. 

&gt;Ah never mind, when in doubt, go for an ad hominem,

I don't think you know what ad hominem means.  Pointing out a logical incoherence in your argument doesn't seem irrelevant to me.  And since when has relating a fairy story narrative had anything to do with values?

I'm not sure what it is you're trying to achieve to be honest - are you defending ""Christian"" values or are you simply trying to show off about how much you know about the UK's religious history and related theological claptrap?",0,1398262217,null,0,false,0,cgzw7bo,t3_23qw38,t1_cgzw7bo,t1_cgzvmu1,null,1433483939,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Not many people care about how many Bengalis were starved to death or how many Chinese people were murdered during their rebellion against western rule.

However the world is changing now. The dominance of the west is ending and the countries that used to be victims are getting richer and less depedent on the West. This is the perfect time to drop the whole Empire is good bullshit, make it clear that we condemn it and move on. If we end up in a war with China in the future for example.

The sanctions and the first Gulf War started before Blair's time, so he's not the only culprit but his adding another war and a military occupation on top of the damage didn't help matters any.

In the words of Salam Pax, the famous '[Baghdad Blogger](http://dear_raed.blogspot.co.uk/2003_03_01_archive.html)', writing just as the war started:

&gt;Do you know when the sight of women veiled from top to bottom became common in cities in Iraq? Do you know when the question of segregation between boys and girls became red hot? When tribal law replaced THE LAW? When Wahabi became part of our vocabulary?
It only happened after the Gulf War. I think it was Cheney or Albright who said they will bomb Iraq back to the stone age, well you did. Iraqis have never accepted religious extremism in their lives. They still don’t. Wahabis in their short dishdasha are still looked upon as sheep who have strayed from the herd. But they are spreading. The combination of poverty/no work/low self esteem and the bitterness of seeing people who rose to riches and power without any real merit but having the right family name or connection shook the whole social fabric. Situations which would have been unacceptable in the past are being tolerated today.

&gt;They call it “al hamla al imania – the religious campaign” of course it was supported by the government, pumping them with words like “poor in this life, rich in heaven” kept the people quiet. Or the other side of the coin is getting paid by Wahabi organizations. Come pray and get paid, no joke, dead serious. If the government can’t give you a job run to the nearest mosque and they will pay and support you. This never happened before, it is outrageous. But what are people supposed to do? thir government is denied funds to pay proper wages and what they get is funneled into their pockets.

I'd like to make it harder for employment agencies to take a cut of a minimum wage pay cheque ensuring that the worker gets less than MW for their work. I've met plenty of people doing part-time work catering/bartending who have much more experience than me and have much more time to commit and yet are still getting less than minimum wage while I'm getting more because I went straight through the employer and don't have to pay an agency. I once met a 17 year old, Indian kid who due to his age, non-EU nationality and agency contract was earning somewhere in the region of £4 an hour (maybe less, I can't remember) for long, hard work. Inevitably people realise they're being screwed but there's always a clause in their contract forcing them to leave at least 6 months between ending work with the agency and taking direct employment from a company they work with (something they know full well is not an option for lots of these people who live pay cheque to pay cheque).

true,Robo_Garlando,eng-yorkshire,Manc in Yorks,"Buy and resell seasonal stuff from the supermarkets. It's more of a long term(ish) investment, but basically: Buy things like swimming pools when places heavily discount them (in November / December) then resell them when they're in demand the following summer. You can easily double your money.

The second thing you can do is go around carboot sales etc and buy stuff cheap to resell on Ebay. People are generally willing to give stuff away on the carboot especially if you buy a job-lot from them. When I was 15 I made £100 in a month just re-selling SNES and NES games online.  

The last thing (but it's a bit more risky) is invest in buying things that relate to an old famous person. For example buy up like Paul McCartney / The Beatles related stuff and when Paul McCartney eventually hits the grave demand for anything related to him will go through the roof, you can then sell it on for a tidy profit (I did this when MJ passed away). I know this last one sounds a little unethical, but hey making money isn't always pleasant. 

The only thing I would suggest is if you do do any of these, make sure you don't fall into the rut of relaying on it as income.

true,yhkim1219,null,null,"I am A third year economics student! I've also done A level Economics so my story will hopefully give a perspective form a students view.

A level economics is mostly Classical (almost all Neoclassical when we go into topic 2) versus Keynes. However, they usually come out with very very similar results. It is all theory with very little maths. I honestly think it was one of the easiest A levels and could have been done for GCSE's. 

The current economics A level curriculum gives a very bad representation of what economics is in a graduate level and to be fair most teachers do warn us of this. In a graduate level there are three parts of economics you learn (in my case anyway): The maths, Theory and finance.

The Maths solely focuses on Core Maths and Statistics during the first and second year of study which are very similar to C3, C4, S1, S2 of A level Maths, but some other tools are introduced such as Lagrangian and some statistical ones like Moving Averages, Heteroscedasticity, etc (from econometrics), Also I would like to mention these were, quite rightly, compulsory in my University

Finance is just all the theory/maths on a micro (and some macro) level focusing on the industry. So things like how financial markets, institutions work, corporate finance, etc.. Those students who wants to go into Banking, Accounting, Consulting, etc would focus on these modules

The Theory as you might guess is all Micro and Macro - depending on the modules you choose went very deep into the subject. So after the obvious Micro/Macro 1&amp;2, you could study Macro Economic Policies, History of Economic Thought, Development Economics, Advanced Micro Etc. These were personally my favourite modules and was the route I took when studying. I think this part has been the centre of criticism amongst the economists. Many if not the majority of the texts books Micro and Macro books are based on are Neoclassical and Keynesian, Economics, with more weight on Neoclassical. The lecturers do know this and always do say to take the texts books with a huge pinch of salt as the assumptions and models that these schools of thought makes are nothing like the real world. It has been proved time and time again that religiously following either of these schools of thought can cause massive disasters. Most Economists know this and portray it to their students very well. **HOWEVER** this is crucial, I think Classcial (this includes neoclassical) and Keynsian is the best when teaching and introducing economics first to students. They are the most basic and makes strong assumptions that creates simple models that are easier to understand then you can open it up bit by bit introducing different schools of thought and scrutinise the models. For example Keynes vs Austrian vs Classical is the popular one now. (Austrian I stress on Hayek, but Austrian is the name of the School of Thought, Also Classical I stress on Neoclassical, Traditional Classicals and Marx, also Marxist Economics has become extremely popular lately)

Teaching the Austrian thought, Marxism and bypassing the traditional Classical Economics I think would be pretty difficult on the students due to the sheer importance it has had on economics, I mean that's when it all started! with Adam Smith! It's like teaching Quantum Physics without teaching the kids Newton because it's strictly not quite right. 

However I do think the pace of teaching economics is quite slow. In university, (its quite similar for all from talking to friends) the first year is basically a recap of all of the Maths, statistics and basic Economics. So it kind of wastes at least one semester in my opinion. This is I strongly believe is because the prerequisites of studying Economics is just Maths and also the A levels are inadequate. What you start studying in second year should start a semester early and to do this, the prerequisite should be better taught. I mean the universities shouldn't have to waste a semester teaching supply/demand, how to do basic calculus.

They should teach GCSE Economics, teach them Classicals and Keynes (topic one and two of A levels can be taught here), Then in Alevels go a little deeper into the theory part, But also bring in the maths part of economics!! &lt;- the most important bit. This means the universities doesn't have to waste a semester teaching basic maths and economics and can put Economics as a prerequisite not Maths. Same goes for the international curriculum but I don't know much about it except IB...

Anyway, this is my rant on Economics in general. thanks for listening! I'm going to make myself lunch now. Hope this gave some insight...",0,1398263853,null,0,false,0,cgzwvra,t3_23r81d,t1_cgzwvra,t3_23r81d,null,1433484322,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

2. Striker: Borini will be 3rd choice and so if another player comes in it would be someone who could also play another position (wide forward) or a young striker with potential. However romantic it'd be, I couldn't see FSG willing to pay the wages that an older player like Torres would want.

3. FB: I predict both a left and right back coming in who are both top quality. Johnson's playing level as of late has been terrible and deserving of no more than a mid table club, while Flanno looks decent but can still be improved on. The competition for Flanno should help his development too.

4. Fully agree here so long as Agger isnt sold.

5. CM. I think only 1 of these players will be signed. Probably more likely to be an AM as were quite well stocked in CM.

&gt;Actually, English clubs have a different structure in the area of ​​responsibility of the sports management than those in Germany. The coach also has the tasks of a manager in England. But at Tottenham is different. There Coach Tim Sherwood focuses on the care of the team, Franco Baldini is Manager, as we know it from most German clubs. However, after a regular season there is criticism of the former assistant coach of the Italian stars Fabio Capello. Tottenham standing on table in sixth place, which is not necessarily enough to participate in the international competition.

&gt;From England learned the WAZ that the Spurs are looking for a successor for Baldini, and Allofs is high on the list. A few weeks ago, the English seem to have asked the Wolfsburg manager. But how seriously should we take this interest from London? It attracts the Wolves manager, who had come only one and a half years ago from Werder Bremen, as already gone from Wolfsburg? ""No, there is no ambition to change me,"" says Allofs on WAZ-demand, without however denying the Tottenham interest. He adds significantly: ""I am responsible for the VfL, my contract runs for a while, and I like my job very area.""

I take it you didnt bother to read up on the political upheavals caused by the reformation? What a surprise!

&gt;  Bet you don't go around defending Islamists by saying, yeah well, all they want is a second Caliphate. It's all political you know. Nothing to do with their religious convictions.

Islam is irrelevant to this discussion. Nice strawman, though.

&gt; Ah yes, a man of sense. Let's not listen to him at all.

He's only anti-Catholic in the sense that he was massively pro-Protestant, which puts his credibility as a historic source in jeopardy. Most people learned about source bias in GCSE history. Are you really this dense?

&gt; Yeah, alchemy was a legitimate field of study too.

Yeah, alchemy *was* - past tense noted. Theology, the study of religion, still *is* in the modern age. 

And, by the way, alchemy eventually became chemistry, genius.

&gt;  As I said, you're studying fairies, just with fancy names. That's not wasted human effort at all. Anyone who tries to ""prove"" anything with Theology isn't worth listening to. 

Wow, you're a moron. Theology is the study of religion, not the study of god. If you really don't see the value in studying something that has been a driving force in human social development [since the dawn of time](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Wien_NHM_Venus_von_Willendorf.jpg) then I pity you.

Except you didn't do that though, did you. You implied that because I was 'defending what are maybe the values of the maybe son of a sky fairy' that my opinions are less valid.

So not only was your statement an attempt to discredit me, but it was based on a false assertion too. 

&gt; I'm not sure what it is you're trying to achieve to be honest - are you defending ""Christian"" values or are you simply trying to show off about how much you know about the UK's religious history and related theological claptrap?

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; it's only the grouping of MPs into parties that forces them to look after the interests of the country in general,

But they do in the end end up looking after the interests of the people of the UK, no matter which party gets to power. The Council of Europe does not force the members to look after the interests of the people of the EU, or the people of the UK.


&gt;but then isn't that the point, that nobody has any greater or lesser of a say in how the organisation operates

I think the problem is that the EU system means that you can get situations where just 28 people are making decisions that affect 450 million people, without having to be accountable to anyone on that decision.

In the UK, all legislation has to go through the house of commons, and everyone there has been elected and gets a vote. The PM's vote holds no more power than anyone else's. 

In contrast the European council can pass legislation using special legislative procedure, which means they do not have to be approved by the EU parliament. Those 28 people can pass whatever legislation they want. This is also why block voting could be a problem, get a few people to agree with you privately and affect the lives of 450 million people, most of whom didn't vote for you.

That is not what is being argued/motioned: Equality =/= equivalence.

They're not suggesting relgious beliefs for why marriage should be recognized differently: They're saying heterosexual and homosexual pair-bonds are fundamentally different: Eg as applied to scaling up into society via legal terms, insitutions etc: The scientific record tends to draw the number of 90% heterosexual : 10% homosexual (last I remember). You one pair-bond which is able biologically to procreate childen (those 2 people): This is the difference with which society should work from I think the paper more or less works from.

Unfortunately it's beyond my own area of expertise, to develop the argument further than that, but I think that definition is distinct to form 2 related insitutions in society that celebrate their similiaries and their differences.

Norway and Switzerland are somewhat awkward, not just because of their status as ultra-high income small economies, but because they rejected membership whilst still on the course to achieve it, and it's why the application process for the Central European countries was very different. It's unlikely that the UK would be offered a similar deal, because it would create a free-rider problem for other members.

&gt;Factually correct: There is no EU demos.

Which is a lame argument. Demos' are effects of elections, governance and statehood, not causes. Is there no Saudi demos because they do not have elections there? Would there still be three separate demoses in the Indian subcontinent if India had not been partitioned? Is there one Chinese demos, or two with an additional one in Taiwan?

That's why the ""No Demos"" argument is lame. It doesn't fully engage with the point that federalists are making about democracy and the EU - we can introduce more democracy, more legitimacy, more significance to elections to solve the democratic deficit. We can then have another discussion about which powers should be transferred over to Brussels, if any. If this goes well, a demos might arise, but one can't occur until more democracy is present in Brussels. It's a circular argument; there's no demos, so we shouldn't give more democracy to the EU, so no demos is created.

&gt;This is why a political union won't practically work and is unnecessary and why eg Norway has MORE influence paradoxically out of the EU than in it. The system Treaties is flawed where no reform for the realities of particular countries in history, culture, society, politics, law, religion, geography and economy cannot be reconciled. It's too diverse.

So European diversity can (supposedly) not be overcome, so your solution is ...what? To just turn our backs on other Europeans and not even try? Diversity in Europe is something that can be celebrated as well as a danger - sure, perhaps some Slavs up in the Balkans hate their neighbours in the next village and will do so for generations, but if Franco-German, Franco-English, German-Slav enmity can not just fade but be crushed utterly, anything else comes across as small beer in comparison.

I would put good money on us selling/releasing more players than we buy.

We have some very good players out on loan that will come straight back into the first team: Borini and Suso for sure, while Assaidi, Wisdom, Ibe, Ilori, will all get a look during preseason, as well as other youngsters like Coady, Rossiter, McLaughlin, etc.  Reina will definitely go and some of this year's loanees that won't find a place will be let go as well.

I'll say definitely a winger and centerhalf signed, likely an experienced international fullback and another striker to rotate (meaning players will be sold at fullback and striker).

I've heard people say central midfield depth but I think that's off the mark.  A proper winger will mean less diamond and when they do play one midfielder forward, both Coutinho and Sterling can fit that role.

I think it depends. The odds are stacked against most parties, but the LibDems managed it so there is a slim chance and development in the EU itself may increase/decrease the opportunity. But this line from the blog in particular is the important consideration:

&gt;*Without assurance that there is a detailed plan in place the public will not take the leap of voting to leave the EU.   Therefore details have to be carefully worked out and a compelling case made that the UK has positive reasons to leave the EU, and will have opportunities and benefits as a result.*

Having given enough lead-time to the Briitish public to be informed on the options in the event of a Brexit and otherwise staying in the EU (Federalization?), I believe this argument needs to be delivered more strongly.

For the last week or two, the media have been critical of our squad depth in terms of European football for next year (including Carra on Sky over the weekend), but we don't need as many signings as many seem to think. I said in August that we would do better than Spurs because they made so many signings and none of them know how to play together. Brendan won't let that happen. I would put good money on us selling/releasing more players than we buy.

We have some very good players out on loan that will come straight back into the first team: Borini and Suso for sure, while Assaidi, Wisdom, Ibe, Ilori, will all get a look during preseason, as well as other youngsters like Coady, Rossiter, McLaughlin, etc. Reina will definitely go and some of this year's loanees that won't find a place will be let go as well.

I'll say definitely a winger and centerhalf signed, likely an experienced international fullback and another striker to rotate (meaning players will be sold at fullback and striker).

I've heard people say central midfield depth but I think that's off the mark. A proper winger will mean less diamond and when they do play one midfielder forward, both Coutinho and Sterling can fit that role. So you've got Gerrard, Hendo, Allen and Lucas, plus at least one of Coady/Rossiter with the first team. Unless 2 of the last six are sold/loaned, I don't see another player coming in.",0,1398266103,null,0,false,0,cgzxvlx,t3_23r6ku,t1_cgzxvlx,t1_cgzspvg,null,1433484792,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

His side has taken points off the likes of Dortmund, Schalke and Bayern with more regularity than just about any other club.

Not only that, but he has an excellent record with youth players, as the likes of ter Stegen, Reus, Patrick Herrmann, Havard Nordveidt and Branimir Hrgota have all broken through and improved massively under his management, yet all the while he balanced it nicely with the older players in the side.

Which is?  If anyone's forcing anything down a filter it's you.  The thread has nothing to do with the reformation.  My original post simply used More's enjoyment of a good bonfire as an example.  What this is, is a tacit admission that you can't offer any contention to the real argument about Christian values, but that you'll drag the debate into pedantry on your chosen topic in an effort to score smartarse points.  More was burning people alive in the 1500's for religious reasons.  This does not gel with 1500 years of wonderful Christian values in society.  That's the point I was making; it's the point I continue to assert.  

&gt;Carry on tipping your fedora, neckbeard.

Fuck me that's droll from a guy getting hot under the collar and posting documents about political shennanigans during the reformation...

&gt;And, by the way, alchemy eventually became chemistry, genius.

Nope, it *contributed towards* chemistry.  Alchemy is philosophy and magic more than it's anything to do with chemistry, genius.  One certainly did not become the other.  

&gt;Islam is irrelevant to this discussion. Nice strawman, though.

No it is not irrelevant, because we are talking about how people see religious values.  A comparison to another religion is absolutely relevant for perspective.  Relevant to your hard-on for reformation history, agreed, not so much. 

&gt;He's only anti-Catholic in the sense that he was massively pro-Protestant, which puts his credibility as a historic source in jeopardy. Most people learned about source bias in GCSE history. Are you really this dense?

Nah, but it's fun to fuck with you a little. 

Here's the thing in a nutshell - Grieve is talking about this country having 1500 years of Christian values.  Christianity in the last 1500 years has been a litany of violence and abuse.  It has continually sought to ostracise and demonise those that do not serve its purpose or those whose beliefs differ.  If you can't see a problem with Grieve's comment in the light of that, I'm not going to baby-step you up it.

On the other hand I will make the argument that this isn't really something that the NHS should be paying for and it's up to the religious community to make those services available to those who need it by their own means. But for all millions seems like a lot, on something with a budget on the scale of the NHS it's not statistically significant.

His defensive work rate fluctuates and his positioning defensively (when on the wing) is usually very poor. When counter attacking with pace does often play good key passes, though teams have limited this against Villa, particularly since Xmas. His best position is probably 4-4-2 being one of the 2, with limited defensive duty and a target man to feed off. I would say possibly would be much better with a more supportive midfield, as Villa generally do not send many men forwards to help the attackers/ move defenders out of position unless on a break. I think his poor season is symptomatic of a generally very poor Villa season and poor team, but has not looked good all year and is usually one of the first names I think should be taken off.

If he equals the 72 points total that AVB set last season and continues to put together a team that can smash in a lot of goals (11 in our last 3 games, 33 in his 19 EPL games in charge) he can probably make a case for himself. I mean, it is hard to deny Eriksen/Adebayor have been in great form under him. He also has seemingly got something out of Kane and blooded Velkovic, surely Levy will appreciate the youth being used.

Defence is obviously the largest issue right now (Sherwood has 24% clean sheets, AVB had 44%) and if he can sort that out for the rest of the season he may be in with a shot.

true,kde01,king,,"&gt; Hmm, interesting for many reasons. Mostly because a DoF was requested by AVB and without him here I find it hard to believe that Levy would replace Baldini (rather than just do away with him).
&gt; 
Agreed. A DoF is very foreign to football in England, but i think (as long as you get a good one) it will really benefit the club as a whole.

&gt; Assuming Sherwood stays, I doubt he would want a DoF. Assuming he goes, it seems odd to snap up a new DoF before a new manager comes in. Which ever way you look at it there doesn't seem to be a great deal of sense.
&gt; 
 
Agreed again.

&gt; 
&gt; I can't help but look at the current Roma side and notice that Baldini had a large hand in building it (possibly had nothing to do with Strootman). Soldado and arguably Paulinho aside, the players brought in have not been unimpressive, injury and a bloated midfield make things look worse than they are.
&gt;

There was a really good article posted here around early August '13 talking about how Baldini has basically made a career/name off the successes of the managers he worked with. He worked off their success and went after the players they wanted. He just brokered the deals, and never necessarily brought in anyone special of his own accord. 

I really don't think we'll miss him.

If there's something wrong with his shoulder they'll have to decide to either gamble with it and attempt to use PT to get it more stable or to have surgery. If he has surgery he'll be in a sling for at least 3-5 weeks before being able to start range of motion therapy. After getting his motion back is a matter of strengthening the shoulder. With the resources of a big team he'll likely be able to spend more time/money and have a faster recover than I have.

social functions, from encouraging responsibility to strengthening the family unit as a whole. The essence of traditional marriage is its care and 
reach extends beyond mere partnership.""

Red herring. How does traditional (by which I can only assume these authors mean '20th century' marriage, unless they want to go back to betrothals arranged by parents for business purposes) marriage do these wonderful things but gay marriage not? Gay marriage doesn't encourage responsibility or strengthen the family? 

&gt;""But we believe that this cause is not advanced by destroying the speciﬁc responsibilities and institutions of those who are not homosexual""

How would gay marriage do this? Don't bother reading the paper if you want to know...just another red herring. 

&gt;""Better, we believe that there is provision for a religious recognition of civil partnerships – something far more radically inclusive than any attempt at equal marriage.""

How is separate-but-not-quite-equal better? Once again, a lot of empty words and no argument. But...and here's the thing...if you're already opposed to gay marriage but can't explain why without sounding like a bigot, this paper is full of things that sound almost like arguments.

I still think the *""burden of proof""* is on UKIP to provide one however and secondly given how monumentally complicated it would be to disseminate that plan in time, they have no option but to go ahead and start working on a Brexit plan and using their supporters to further divulge it to others and spread ""the good news"".

There are 2 plans I'm aware of that they have floated:

* [Out of the EU and into the World](http://www.ukip.org/out_of_the_eu_into_the_world_report) ~ William Dartmouth MEP

* [Cutting the Gordian knot: A road map for. British exit from the. European Union](http://www.iea.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/files/Entry23_Cutting%20the%20Gordian%20knot_web.pdf) ~ Iain Murray and Rory Broomfield

The 3 categories you can allocate Brexit plans broadly into:

1. WTO
2. EFTA
3. EEA

In order of distance (highest-lowest) of Brexit with the EU.

- William Dartmouth goes for the 1. which is high risk but high reward as it were.
- Rory Bloomfield goes for 2. but that is still high risk but less risk than 1. and high reward.

The blog actually mentions an eg of 3.: 

* [Flexcit: how we would actually leave the EU](http://www.eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=84857)

This is much much less risky but substantially lower reward also.

If what you are saying is correct:

&gt;*it'll get attacked, criticised and damage their potential negotiation position should there be a yes vote on exit.*

Then that would follow that the plan that is least susceptible to being attacked would be the most advantageous ie option 3. Flexcit. It then like the Scots Independence movement could focus on Nationality/Sovereignty/Independence/Democracy &gt; Economic fear-creating. I think the problem for the Scots is they don't have a clear economic plan that then leaves them open to attack?

I think it's more a case of building people's tolerance up to the point they used to the idea of Brexit and they are comfortable with the options on the table for Brexit as compared to EU (Federal?) membership ?

Initially the idea of the unknown is frightening, the opponents will be at their most fierce in even contemplating such as rash option, but reasonable delivery of the facts if the safe option is chosen and the promise of the returns of self-determination: I can't see but how that is the biggest rewards any party could offer the voters?

In actual fact if you can suggest the reward is ""Democracy, self-determination, sovereignty"" it is still a huge reward if the economic costs are either negligibly positive or negative or even 0.",0,1398268137,null,0,1398268367,0,cgzyu9l,t3_23rmhk,t1_cgzyu9l,t1_cgzxp5f,null,1433485246,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Ah yes, the filter of education. How terrible of me.

&gt; The thread has nothing to do with the reformation. My original post simply used More's enjoyment of a good bonfire as an example.

If you cite Sir Thomas More then you're talking about the reformation, genius. Also six people were burned during Thomas More's tenure, only three of which he was directly involved in. Sorry but the facts don't fit the frame you're making for them.

&gt; What this is, is a tacit admission that you can't offer any contention to the real argument about Christian values, but that you'll drag the debate into pedantry on your chosen topic in an effort to score smartarse points. 

You can't even decide what Christian values are, so I don't really think your opinions on them have much credence.

&gt; More was burning people alive in the 1500's for religious reasons. This does not gel with 1500 years of wonderful Christian values in society. That's the point I was making; it's the point I continue to assert. 

It's not the point you originally made, and it's not the point that I called you out on. Nice attempt to reframe the debate though.

&gt; Nope, it contributed towards chemistry. Alchemy is philosophy and magic more than it's anything to do with chemistry, genius. One certainly did not become the other. 

Nope. Alchemy is regarded as the protoscience that became chemistry. Feel free to prove me wrong. Don't worry, I'll wait.

&gt; No it is not irrelevant, because we are talking about how people see religious values.

No, you were saying 'I bet if it was muslims you wouldn't be saying that'. You weren't talking about 'people', you were talking about me specifically. It's just a few posts above this one if you want to go back and check.

&gt; Nah, but it's fun to fuck with you a little. 

It's not really working. I am confident in my knowledge and, like most people in this forum, I enjoy being right.

&gt; Christianity in the last 1500 years has been a litany of violence and abuse. It has continually sought to ostracise and demonise those that do not serve its purpose or those whose beliefs differ. If you can't see a problem with Grieve's comment in the light of that, I'm not going to baby-step you up it.

Well, when you tell me to look at religion 'in the light of that', then you're really asking me to look at it through your distorted prism. There have certainly been numerous low points for Christianity but to describe its influence over this country as a 1500 year-long ""litany of violence and abuse"" is untrue and ridiculously hyperbolic.

Also there's no way of knowing this. IMO if we managed to get Willian/Mkhitaryan for ~30m maybe there might not have been enough cash for Sakho/Illori.

Eriksen joining might have led to him and Coutinho constantly operating on the left leaving us with no Sterling-revelation. Sterling only got his chance when Sturridge got injured, any other option during that time might have impeded his chance to get in.

Salah/Kono might have helped but we're undefeated in 2014, only drawn once since the window closed so really all that we might have had would be 2 extra points, and that's IF Sterling managed to worm his way past any signing to play his part. (5 of his 8 goals came after the window closed, any winger in then would probably have come at his expense)

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;You just called our, now starting keeper terrible. He had a faultless game today, and now you're saying that keepers should be faultless all the time? No shit?

I'm not sure how to respond to this.  Do you disagree that keepers are expected to be 100% faultless?  I simply do not understand how anyone could disagree with that. 

&gt;Remember that David Luiz own goal against PSG? That was 95% Cech's fault. That ball came in through the six hard box and he say on his ass on the goal line. That ball MUST be the keepers ball, no fault to Luiz, just bad luck.

I disagree with 95%, but I would place the blame on Cech for that goal.  Like I've said, the *expectation* is 100% faultless play from your keeper.  Mistakes happen.  Cech has proven that he makes mistakes rarely enough to be on a team with a chance at winning the Premier and Champions leagues.   Schwarzer is not. 

&gt;You can't even spell his fucking name right. Schwarzer. Not Swarzer.

Don't see how that is relevant to a game analysis, but thank you. 

&gt;You say we are unappreciative of Cech, with literally NO backing of that whatsoever. Ask any Chelsea fan, they will sing his praises. You just pulled that out of your ass.

Yes I've explained this, no I didn't pull it out of thin air, but since you want to attack me and be rude rather than read the thread, I'll explain it again. 

Cech's plays, are absolutely not given the credit they deserve, and this happens very often.  Most recently, after Ba scored against PSG.  He made 2 clearances, as well as 1 massive save, that are rarely talked about, and were faintly celebrated afterwards.  It is my opinion that PSG should have scored on at least one of those chances, and he absolutely saved us. 

This is a relfection I make very often.  As a keeper, and a fan of keepers, I'm the first to acknowledge them, and the first to notice when they go unacknowledged.   I've admitted numerous times that this is an *opinion* and a *bias* one at that.  I'm sorry you disagree so wholeheartedly. 

&gt;You subtly (/s, you sounded like an arrogant asshat) say how you're such a high level keeper. Do you have over 100 caps for your nation? 

I have never said, nor claimed to be anywhere near as good as Mark.  Never.  In fact I've said the exact opposite.  

Are you, however, suggesting that I don't have a better ability than most to judge the play of goalkeepers?  Is there nothing you're rather good at that helps you inform opinions regarding those who do it professionally?  I'm sure there is.  I explicitly said I was obviously not at his level, and I've replied to your downright silly suggestion that I think I am in two other places here alone. 

&gt;Is that enough reason for why you're wrong, and why you're being downvoted you little shit?

Keep in mind we are fans of the same team.  I'm trying to be reasonable, please stop being so rude.  It isn't necessary.  I'm not scared of you, it doesn't make you seem tough, we're online chatting about the team we love.  Be an adult. 

Beyond that I still don't know what you're saying I'm wrong about.  Here are my claims, perhaps you can be more clear?

1.  The general expectation of a keeper is to be 100% faultless.  That is *not* to say ""don't get scored on"" but it is to say ""do not make a mistake"".   A very large proportion of goals that are scored cannot be reasonably blamed on the keeper. 

2.  Schwarzer was 100% at fault for the first goal by Sunderland, and made a rather large gaff on the second essentially ensuring Borini would easily score the penalty. 

It is my *opinion* that because of (2) , Schwarzer doesn't satisfy (1), and therefore should be replaced when possible.

It's precisely the point I originally made:

&gt;I think these idiots need to step back and make sure that they want to be associated with ""Christian"" values. Christians were still burning people in London for owning copies of The Bible in English not so long ago. Somehow I doubt that's what Grieve means by 1500 years of Christian input...

Any reframing has been done by you to get us onto your pet history topic.

Proto, as in ""before,"" as in, it wasn't a science.  Chemistry is.  Alchemy contributed some elements.  Alchemy did not become chemistry.  You might just as well say it became medicine. 

&gt; I enjoy being right.

Bingo, never mind the value of the debate eh, as long you feel you're right about something.

Answer yes or not to the following (on behalf of yourself or the authors, I really don't care):

Do you believe gay parents can raise children as well as heterosexual parents can?

Do you believe infertile heterosexual couples or heterosexual couples who choose not to have children should continue to be allowed to marry?

Do you believe divorce should continue to be legal? 

Syaing 'yes' to even one of these quite frankly makes a mockery that their (wholly invented) model of marriage is at all under threat from including gay men and women. If you reject the argument that marriage is only for this bizarre selfless procreation they seem to believe in. (and by the fucking by, having children for reasons other than having more workers? That's a VERY modern idea).They want to reject the partnership model in favour of something they can't quite define but are sure is better.

Thus many of the most prominant alternatives to it are really themselves simply criticisms of Liberal Economics, Marx himself famously wrote very little on what his alternative would look like, so to criticize these alternatives would really amount to a criticism of a criticism, which while a fine and important pursuit is a completely different beast than criticizing an actually existing system.",0,1398269321,null,0,1398269923,0,cgzzemq,t3_23r81d,t1_cgzzemq,t1_cgzxea5,null,1433485512,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

That's not actually true or at least, not in the way that most people will think.

A GP surgery gets their income from different places, including revenue that they have simply for having a patient on their list along with extra payments for managing chronic conditions like diabetes, smoking cessation, obesity and so on.

That income will go to the partners who will then have to decide how much to pay themselves, how much they want to pay the practice administration staff, what they want to spent on equipment and how much they want to spend on locum GP services along with salaried GPs (and what those GPs themselves will earn as a salary).

It's not like your GP gets a cheque each month from HM Treasury; they are more often than not self-employed and their duties will only cover what they negotiate with the partners.

Signing firearms and passport applications are not part of their NHS duties and that's why they are not paid for them by the NHS.

They might well do it for you if they have known you a long time or your family has a decades long association with the practice or that GP (my own mother saw her GP for 30+yrs for example), but they are still not obligated to donate their time for free.

What are these economic reasons, seems to me to be nebulous nonsense to obfuscate the parties underlining bias.

Does NI21 have a clear set of economic parameters on which they base this stance. If so publish them.

NI21 like all the other unionist parties has taken on the stance first put forward by Republican Parties that Northern Ireland needs control of our Taxation. That is a tacit acceptance that Union does not work for Northern Ireland even if the party members choose not to see it that way. London won't give Northern Ireland control over taxation within the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland can't compete with the Republic without it.

So how does NI21 justify it's unionist stance given it's key economic policy that Northern Ireland should gain control over taxation directly contradicts it?

Furthermore the Republic has now recovering, has implemented reforms and currently began prosecuting those responsible. The Republic produces more third level graduates per capita than any other country in Europe while conservatives in England are doing their very best to drive teenagers away from education. The Republic surpasses the United Kingdom on the Human Development Index. The Republic scores better than the United Kingdom on the GINI Index. The Republic runs a healthy trade surplus the United Kingdom a trade deficit. The Republic provides better benefits for the unemployed. The Republic was just announced the number 1 best place for investment by Forbes magazine. The Republic is committed to the European Union and European integration while the United Kingdom's membership is threatened by the continued rise of the United Kingdom Independence Party.

If NI21 is to stand on the economic case for Union they should be able to unequivocally prove that it's continuation is in our interests. If they can't build this argument then they should just admit to being another Unionist party and get on with it.

As a member of NI21 what are the economic Red Lines you base your Unionist position on? What would the Republic have to correct about it's economic policy before you would favour a United Ireland. What are economic policies of the current government of the United Kingdom that give you reason to support the Union?

I disagree with you on this one as it's a professional fee and not an NHS service; a GP will typically do this on a ""let me get back to you"" basis in their own time so that it will not interfere with their NHS duties.

They are entirely right to ant to be compensated for giving up their private time for that.

true,Chrisischan,flair8,,"I absolutely agree with you that Chadli should not be played over Eriksen, Dembele, or Sandro in any of their positions. I think for the moment Chadli is only playing there because Sandro and Dembele's injuries are worse than easily meets the eye. Chadli may not have the tact in the two CM positions as Dembele and Sandro, but he certainly has a quicker step at the moment and I believe that's why Sherwood feels safer playing him there for the immediate time being. But I certainly agree with you that he should not be the solution or plan for those positions, as well as CAM, going forward.

The last time Chadli played on the left however was his cameo against Newcastle. Of course we know how that went, but other than that I cannot think of a single game in which I'd rate his performance from the position above average. As I said, it's pretty clear to me why both our managers this reason have not trusted him with the starting position on that side. He has looked vastly short on confidence in his appearances there, and hardly ever looked for anything other than a quick pass away. 

I'd like to keep him however, since first of all I think he'd be a marvelous striker. I'm looking forward to having a manager come in and potentially utilize him there. I think since he also provides solid cover throughout the remaining attacking positions, such versatility deems him highly useful in a squad I think we need to reduce. 

So due to the instability of our LW position this season, I think there is absolutely no reason not to reward Pritch for the season he's had at Swindon and give him a look in. I see nothing from benefit from it, as the inspirational factor it could have with the other loanees and academy players is just too great to overlook.

Elancer here. Along with Odesk, Elance is probably the best of a bad bunch of websites. All online only freelancer sites are pretty seedy, and you have to watch you back on all of them. A local client base is always far superior. Elance does often take the side of freelancers, though a lot of clients try to game the system as it were, finding excuses not put put money into escrow before work begins which makes it impossible to get help when things go sour. 

Best advice is to sign up for an online webinar that will help you avoid common scams, and never work for a client that can't put his money where his mouth is before work begins.

The annoying thing is that it's not at all.. It's an easier issue to *understand* and adopt, but it's not easier than fixing the problem. 

We have 600+ employees we can delegate the task to and for some reason we're letting *them* tell us the problem and give the solution on how to fix it. Of course they're going to pick the easiest solution.. They won't be in power when it doesn't work. 

It's backwards. We should be telling them the problem, then it should be up to them to go fucking fix it.

In my mind 21 year old Ricardo Rodriguez from Wolfsburg has been playing outstandingly and would easily have my vote for Young Player of the Year. He's been ridiculously good and as a fullback simply puts Luke Shaw and Flanagan to shame. If I was BR, he would be my #1 transfer target, but I could see one of the bigger German or Spanish sides beating us on that deal. Chelsea and United are also suppposed to be after the lad.

Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim is another standout player. 14 goals and 11 assists this season from a midfielder who is also pretty good in a tackle. He's going to be a superstar.

Staying in the EPL, I don't think you can take away from the season Aaron Ramsey has had. Like Sterling, he has had some periods of great form, but for a player who primarily plays as a defensive midfielder, to have 10 goals is still noteworthy.

Sterling is already a special player, but their is a bit of domsetic bias here. I love the lad, but he's not quite at elite status yet.

true,Nowimnotalurker,flair-norwichcity,"Ruddy marvellous ","1) it was always going to be tough for moyes, and I'm sure it didn't help getting rid of a lot of the back room staff that knew the system etc. before he came. I don't think many expected United to win the title again, as the squad is really not on the same tier as he manchester city's, and it was really Sir Alex that was providing the boost to allow them to outplay themselves. However, I don't think many expected no champions league, let alone possibly no Europe, so moyes has definitely dissapointed. Having said that I would definitely have kept him for another season, and let him start to build his own team in the summer.

2) Like: Rooney - despite stealing tettey's goal of the month he's just a fantastic player, even if from an outsiders perspective he hasn't appeared to be playing as well as he could be recently. Also, Velencia: Pace and direct running is always nice to watch... Something we could really do with!

Dislike: Cleverly is the obvious target - I just think he's a bit useless, but that's about it really... I really don't mind united!

3) Hughton's incredibly negative tactics, every away match it looked like we were playing for a 0-0 draw, which did not go well, and after half the season had passed and we'd lost most of our away matches the players had obviously got it in their heads that they couldn't win away, so it was almost too late by the time Hughton started being a bit more adventurous. We were great vs. Fulham though in Adams first match, so I expect us to play quite well on Saturday 

4) ""A manager who got you to 11th last season playing good football"" - NO! Until the second last match of the season we were serious relegation candidates, and it was only two wins vs West Brom and Man City on the last 2 days of the season that catapulted us up a very tight table. Most of our problems last year (Negative approach, no goals, weak away etc.) were exactly the same last season, and the two fantastic performances under Adams have shown that the sacking was absolutely the right decision (although I don't think he has the tactical nous to be in charge for another... Yet!)

5) Although our performances recently have upped our odds of avoiding the drop, we  really are probably going down. We only (probably) need one freak win, so it's always possible, but I don't rate our chances particularly highly unfortunately.

6) No idea, sorry,

7) Liverpool - man city are the only proper contenders now and with their recent injuries I think they are too far gone. I would like to point out that Robert Snodgrass was mocked last year for suggesting that Liverpool would be serious contenders for the title this season... 

8) 1-1. I don't know if the moyes sacking will help or hinder you, but we played our best football this season in the second half vs. Liverpool, and the players will be desperately fighting.

His pace, size, physicality, touch, speed of feet despite his size, and ability to strike the ball are all textbook aspects of a top quality striker. You remember his first goal against Benfica? That was an exemplary case file on the topic. He checked to, received the ball, held it up alone despite pressure, turned 180 degrees against two defenders, went it alone, shielded the ball at pace from his defender, set himself up for a strike, and bended it perfectly into near post from range. Some of these factors are indeed a part of what makes a good winger, but the key differences are the eye for checking to the midfielders in the center by finding pockets admist congestion, top notch hold up play, ability to turn 180 degrees against pressure, and going it alone from the center.

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"But that's the whole point. Release clauses are generally only for the best players at a club, or the ones with the highest potential. As a result, they are extremely high in value. If you then need to pay a further 50% of that release clause, it becomes worthless to even have, as the buying club is pretty much forced into negotiations with the selling club or they can't buy the player. The idea of a release clause is to make negotiations painless and quick and upfront while allowing both the purchaser and the seller to be happy with the transaction. The way they actually work in the context of purchases from non-Spanish clubs accomplishes the opposite.

Honestly, I think release clauses only caught hold in Spain due to the ridiculous lack of parity in the league for the last 20 years. Real and Barca control the money and, without looking, I think it's logical to say they control the influence. A release clause allows them to poach pretty much anyone they want from the other sides, and thus repeats the cycle of their dominance.

true,OldManDubya,eng-hertfordshire,Hertfordshire,"&gt; because a lot of the 'non neoclassical schools' have a lot in them that's about appealing to justice, not a scientific picture of how human beings in an economy interact.

Isn't part of the problem with economics that it has found it difficult to separate doctrine and mechanics?

It seems to me that we should remember that economics is ""political economy"", and we should not forget that whilst we should not mix the nuts and bolts of economics up with our notions of justice and fairness, we should also not leave out applying principle to reality. The Standard Model is of little use without applied physics, and vice versa.  

Once we have proposed and tested general models for the economic behavior of humans *then* set ourselves to reconciling these results our desires. Of course we ought to acknowledge that what society wants is a very slippery concept. Far too many undergraduate courses make do with ""economics is the study of reconciling human beings' unlimited wants with scarce material means"", as if that said anything particularly useful. Far too may people say: orthodox economic theory suggests x, and therefore this outcome is the best outcome. 

Economics needs to be placed within the general environment of humanities, social science and politics. I'm still enamored with Mill's Book VI of the System of Logic, I think it really shows how all these sciences ought to link together in a way they simply don't at present. Economics should be embedded in social science when usually it stands almost completely separate. 

Economics must always be aware of politics as it does straddle the boundary between science and politics; an economic theory will always say something political, whether it means to or not (witness the debate about Thomas Picketty's capital).

&gt; Liverpool will submit their plans in June and are confident they will complete the first phase of their redevelopment by the summer of 2016.

&gt; That will raise the capacity of Anfield to 53k, and a 2nd phase (Anfield Road) will begin soon after that will raise capacity to around 60k.

&gt; **The architects KSS have found a way to complete construction without any reduction in capacity while work is underway.**
__________________________

**Ayre on redevelopment**

&gt; I can't comment on Arsenal but we've found a solution that had a return on investment as quickly as possible - there's no point investing hundreds of millions of pounds if it just burdens you with debt that prevents you from being able to invest in the team.

Aim high is not expect greatness. Expectations and aiming are different things. You strive to achieve something great, but you don't expect it. Expecting is what Man United fans do, it is an assumption of greatness.

We as a club should not be expecting to qualify for the Champions League each year. There is nothing wrong with realism. If you'd rather be deluded and think we are better than we are then go for it.

I have no problems with our club aiming high, I think that we should, but I think there is a problem among Spurs fans where we think we should be better than we are.

Seeing what rogers has done in his tenure at Liverpool makes me think that the best way to make a club like Spurs better is by getting promising Managers who are excelling in the Premier League.

Naturally negotiations would start with the assets and debt initially at the share of GDP. In each area there would be compromises by both sides and each side would have their boundaries.

If the Scottish Government were intending to negotiate on parts of the fleet and didn't get them then they would factor in a cost proportional to manufacturing and service life then either seek the cost from another area or take less debt. 

It's likely that the Scottish Government would not want a full sweep anyway as it gives them the opportunity to build some things in house and give the economy an artificial boost to give a bit of a feel good factor about the industry. They will probably seek a balance between cost effectiveness and creating some jobs.

I cannot emphasize enough his ability to turn 180 degrees and physicality. There are many excellent wingers in this league and others that do not have such traits, even the two-footed ones. Hell, the player I want us to bring in for the position is two-footed and I'm quite sure he wouldn't be capable of such skills. The better wingers tend to field the ball out wide, and use their quick footwork to be able to beat their man. Chadli can do this too, but has not looked confident in doing so in his appearances there and his striker's skills are a far rarer set in combination with his other features.

However, I agree with you for the time being that he would be more useful on the left wing than at striker, especially since as I said it's a weaker position for us at the moment. But with a hopeful new addition at LW, I'd like to see Chadli focus elsewhere while still providing cover for the left wing. Hopefully this will not only allow him to find his niche in the squad, but also allow him to relax a bit more when he does play out wide from reduced psychological pressure.

What I am saying is that even by the reasoning that the paper uses then homosexual couples still deserve the same protection under the law because they have the ability to do the same thing that the paper says is of a benefit to soceity.

I don't have a problem with ""strong marriage"", I'm all for strong marriages between both hetrosexual and homosexual couples. Again personal opinion time: If you want stronger marriages I think it would be of benefit to make actually getting married harder. I don't know how that would be manifest, but I'm sure we could think of something better than a national broadcast of ""The Newley Weds Game""(Ant &amp; Dec to host)

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt; Having just one vote out of 28, and having no say in who the other 27 members who make the decision are does not seem very democratic.

By this logic we shouldn't be part of any international organisation. Both Russia and China get a veto on who the Secretary General of the UN will be and there is certainly no popular vote. Neither do we get to chose the Director General of the WTO which has significant control over international trade policy. Now, withdrawing from the WTO, the UN, the EU, the Commonwealth and every other international organisation where we might be outvoted would mean a huge recovery of policy sovereignty and democratic sovereignty but I'm pretty sure not even the most passionate UKIPper is going to start advocating that because it would be international suicide for the country. So where do you draw the line. Why is being outvoted as to who the Commissioners are in the EU more important to us than the man who runs the United Nations, so much so that we need to think nothing of even suggesting reforms but throw up our hands in defeat and run away? In reality we need to cede some sovereignty and we have to accept that we can't have a popular vote for every person in every position of every international organisation and sometimes it might be best to allow the elected government's decide on behalf of those people. And yes we may be out voted in some cases but being outvoted is no reason to destroy the system. It may be a reason for reform but UKIP is not suggesting reform, it's suggesting we leave having not even suggested to the EU which reforms might improve democratic legitimacy. 

This is probably going to get off track but as far as I can see UKIP people don't want reform; they don't care that reform has not been tried because they don't want the system to work and they never have. It's not like they've given it a try and decided it's not for the best. The very idea of encouraging integration and harmonisation in a globalised world is repugnant to them because it means taking into account foreigners when we draft our domestic policy. Tony Blair said quite rightly in Chicago in 2000 that globalisation had changed the world. The idea that the events, politics and policy in another country are independent from us is non-nonsensical in the 21st century especially when you live right next to these countries. But UKIP don't want this world because it means coming to terms with the rest of the world and becoming part of a wider civilisation rather than part of a nation. For nationalists and for people with very little experience of the world this is outrageous; it's is everyone else's differentness that makes them special by definition. If they have to recognise other people are part of their civil society their parochial philosophy falls down entirely. If your entire philosophy rests on the particular aspects of your particular nation, as UKIP's does, then plurality and political co-operation is itself a threat except where you can make money off them and promote yourself. What UKIP seems to want is as Christopher Hitchens once said, a morose, mid-Atlantic Serbia; a country that has a romantic and disordered attitude to it's own past and a horrific suspicion and paranoia of it's neighbours and even of some of those that live within it's own borders. A country whose leader reacted angrily when it was suggested he was not free to massacre Kosovan Muslims within his own borders. We all know now what sort of a country and what sort of leaders that nationalistic attitude produces and although admittedly I don't think hardcore UKIP supporters are quite Milošević material you just know those would have been the people who would have said in the early days 'Finally, a principled politician who means what he says. I'll vote!'. I don't want anything to do with that corrosive ideology even in the watered down, spineless UKIP variety and it scares me how easily people are seduced by it.

I find a lot of the time people complain they are downvoted for an opinion they are really downvoted for how they express it. Might not be the case here though. 

We are definitely historically a Christian nation. I think the general trend is moving away from that though. While the churchgoers numbers decline the people who consider themselves areligious will rise. The public makes up the public opinion. 

We are historically a monarchy and on paper we still are. Don't expect a revolution before we don't identify as a religious state in the same way most people don't, in practice, consider us a monarchy.

None of the other organisations have the power to dictate laws and legislation in this country. They can say how things run outside of this county, or between countries, but they cannot dictate national laws like the EU or the European Council can. No member of those organisations is ceding any sovereignty to them. 

&gt;UKIP people don't want reform; they don't care that reform has not been tried because they don't want the system to work and they never have.

This is not true. You've gone on a long rant about all the things UKIP is against, but i'm not sure where you are getting your information from, because what you have said bares almost no relation to actual UKIP policy. 

UKIP wants to be a part of Europe, just not this Europe. UKIP is in favour of free trade and immigration of skilled labour. but there are many things which are forced on us by the EU which it disagrees with, like open boarders. Time and again the EU commission has said this is non negotiable. How can you reform something that is non negotiable? 

&gt;The very idea of encouraging integration and harmonisation in a globalised world is repugnant to them

It is the EU which prevents us from greater integration and harmonisation, as we are unable to run our own trade deals with out the consent of the EU. Again, you have a very skewed view of what UKIP wants, UKIP want the UK to trade with Europe, it also wants the UK to trade with the commonwealth, Asia, America and everyone else which we are prevented from doing by being a part of the EU. 

The main issue is this, UKIP wants the UK to make trade decisions by itself, the EU wants those decisions to be made by Europe as a whole. UKIP doesn't want the UK to hide away from the global economy, quite the opposite, it wants it to take full advantage of it in a way that it cannot do when part of the EU.

true,aldhelm,null,null,"To be honest I hope it doesn't happen. Political parties should be based on political ideas not ethnic/religious. If Muslims or Blacks/Asian/etc had their own political parties it would mean that other parties get weaker and they will have no reason to court muslim voters. Also people may have different opinion to the political party that represents their group. I prefer the way UK politics works now.

Let me give you an example of why the Tories don't get many minority votes. My constituency can be split into two. You got one area that is poor and mainly white working class, this area is close to a train station that goes all the way to Central London near Westminster. The other area is mainly Asian and there is a small muslim minority there like me. 

During election time, Labour and Tory MPs like to travel to the first one because it's right next to the train station. They can leave House of Commons, take the train station, hang around the high street for an hour, take the train station back to the city center. Everybody knows this so no one gives a shit. However Tories party workers do all of their campaigning in the white area. That's where they knock doors and have public meetings. All we get are leaflets promising us that they will curb immigration and keep Britain British. We're not for immigration but ignoring us and talking about that makes people in my area think they're closet racists.

Labour on the other hand is smarter. They get party activists of different ethnicies and religion to do the campaigning in both areas. This is an advantage for Labour because our area has old people who can't really speak English well. There will always be a second or third generation minority party worker who can speak to them in their language. They explain to them what Labour is and why they should vote for them. While conveniently leaving out some of the things Labour supports but a 80 year Indian guy wouldn't support. The Asian side always votes labour and the other side is usually split between Labour and Tory. Which means that Labour wins our seat easily. Even last time when our Labour MP was a thief and David Cameron was helping the tory candidate.

Sometimes the Tory party will attempt to win over minorities. However they usually end up shooting themselves in the foot. They usually get somebody who is from the same ethnicity that the majority of the people in the area are. That usually backfires on them. The people they field are usually rich successful businessmen who don't come from the same area. The local people will just consider them to be token ethnic minority and ignore them. We don't vote based on the ethnicity of our candidates. That is insulting. I don't know why they bother doing that since Labour never does. They'll field Asian candidates in white areas, they'll field white candidates in Asian areas. They win because most people who are ethnic minorites trust them.",0,1398278424,null,0,false,0,ch03vc6,t3_23qw38,t1_ch03vc6,t1_ch01pd5,null,1433487625,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Now, luckily the area has been changed a little bit, but still no cycle provision, but it is easier to see up and down the hill now.

Of course, that is only hypothetical, but honestly, it's a toss up a lot of time of ""staying alive"" or ""chance to be hit by car"", I use to cycle locally, and was safer, except on main roads, if we were to adopt the Dutch way with good cycle paths and such, I would gladly cycle more, but until then, I just walk everywhere.",0,1398279415,null,0,false,0,ch04dii,t3_23rzvd,t1_ch04dii,t1_ch02yxn,null,1433487925,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;You appear to be equating immigration 100 years ago to an entire continent which was resource rich, small population and infrastructure poor (therefore unlimited work to do) with an advanced economy.

I don't think the difference is as huge as you imply; it's not like the economy worked in a fundamentally different way. Money still changed hands and was used to employ people. There would only be a significant difference if jobs were in significantly shorter supply than the other. In that case one would have, as you say, unlimited work to do and the other would have more people than the economy was able to employ. In that case . But the period I refer to after 2004-7 was a period of economic growth where unemployment fell despite high immigration meaning the economy was employing people faster than they were coming in during the highest EU immigration period in history. Again if there was a connection between unemployment and immigration that is not totally out-weighed the effect of the economy in general I would have expected to see it then but we didn't. 

&gt; You appear to be advocating some form of Pyramid scheme

Well, the pyramid scheme would be simplistic but my point is that the idea that immigrants are displacing native UK workers 1:1 is just plain wrong. I've heard figures of 13:1, 1 UK worker displaced for every 13 immigrants but these are usually caveated to hell. Theresa May made a similar statement regarding wages and [this article picks it apart](https://fullfact.org/factchecks/immigration_jobs_wages-28674). They actually conclude she is right but only in respect of non-EU, temporary immigrants during recessions and only at the rate of 23 UK workers displaced for every 100 immigrants. EU migrants were not found to have significant effects on wages. We have control over non-EU migration and only allow in skilled people so UKIP shouldn't be worried about this effect. 

Besides I fail to believe that about 130,000 net EU immigrants (about 20,000 will be students) of which some unknown fraction of which will be unskilled labourers most of whom will work, will use money to stimulate the economy and who will pay taxes while claiming benefits at lower rates than UK citizens (given most immigrants are working age and come to work) can have such a huge categorically negative influence on an economy of 60 million people. So categorical in fact that UKIP decide to put it on a poster [like this](http://www.channel4.com/media/c4-news/images/730_wide_images/21_3poster.jpg). Well, I don't believe it and even if I did there is nowhere near enough evidence to justify such rhetoric, rhetoric so clearly meant to scare people. If I can't call bullshit on this I don't know what I would be able to call out. I mean, the poster rests on the direct assumption that EU immigration = UK workers being sacked and immigrants being taken on instead. Can we at least agree that that is a baseless implication and clearly misleading?",0,1398279539,null,0,false,0,ch04ft5,t3_23okc8,t1_ch04ft5,t1_ch00hjb,null,1433487956,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

But the NHS spending on religion has nothing to do with treatment, it's purely to do with *comfort*. It's about how humans are being treated during their stay rather than anything to do with the medical side of things.

Also we can scientifically prove that homoeopathy doesn't work, but likewise there is no shortage of evidence that someone's mood and overall happiness has an effect on their recovery times. So in that sense it's an entirely reasonable thing to do if it makes people *happy* rather than any direct result (which is what homoeopathy pretends to be)

true,inawordno,eng-westmidlands,Brummie,"&gt;Not at all. The danger with homoeopathy is that people may seek it out as a form of treatment and ignore proper medical advance, and the issue of it being on the NHS 'legitimising' it.

Can't the same argument be made of religious counselling? As long as neither are pushed as alternatives when they won't work maybe we can just leave them. 

&gt;But the NHS spending on religion has nothing to do with treatment, it's purely to do with *comfort*. It's about how humans are being treated during their stay rather than anything to do with the medical side of things.

And as long as Homeopathy is only pushed when conventional medicine does nothing, or is detrimental, I am fine. I would rather give someone with a sugar pills than antibiotics. 

&gt;Also we can scientifically prove that homoeopathy doesn't work, but likewise there is no shortage of evidence that someone's mood and overall happiness has an effect on their recovery times. So in that sense it's an entirely reasonable thing to do if it makes people *happy* rather than any direct result (which is what homoeopathy pretends to be)

We can scientifically prove that placebos help.

&gt;Edit: I'm going to heavily emphasise that the NHS doesn't mix 'religion' and 'treatment' at all - which seems to be what you're implying. This is purely about providing chaplaincy services and comfort to those who are believers.

Sorry, not what I'm implying. I was drawing a comparison to say that as long as we keep an eye on them maybe both are okay.

I personally am against the use of either both. I would rather psychiatric or palliative care than a religious bloke in almost every single case. Just saying that for the moment maybe as long as they are working there's no sense in making a fuss. 

I am essentially agreeing.

Could be I'm just getting unlucky whenever I go there but 3-4 times it's been this way so I gave up on them. So when I go into the city centre for footy (which is rare since I prefer my local in Beeston), I tend to gravitate towards smaller places a little further out like the Horn in Hand up near Rock City, which has a huge screen proportional to its size and a decent, quick bar service.

We should be. We should always expect that. That's my point, that's the crux of the argument. We should always expect our players to be getting better, to be striving higher. It's not enough to be ""as good as we are."" That's the entire point of ""It is better to fail aiming high than to succeed aiming low."" You talk about expectations as if it's the worst thing in the world when we don't get what we expect from our players. On the contrary, it's kind of the point.

true,apr400,null,null,"The two systems are very different things. Cleanfeed is entirely transparent to the user - you can not opt out of it except by moving to an ISP that doesn't implement it (one or two don't but the vast majority do). Cleanfeed only blocks material on the IWF list, ie deemed to be probably or actually illegal in the UK but hosted outside the UK (illegal material hosted within the UK leading to prosecution). If you try to visit a Cleanfeed listed page you will simply get ""website not found"". There are some problems with the implementation in that it routes all traffic to a domain containing a listed page through a proxy, so when something like a page on imgur gets tagged the entire imgur site runs like molasses in the UK. There is only one cleanfeed implementation which all the ISP that implement it use. Cleanfeed has been in place for about 10 years. 

The opt-out filters are a different beast entirely. These block all sorts of non-illegal material on the basis of 'morality'. Whilst the list is common to all ISPs, the blocking method is implemented locally by the ISPs. When you try to go to a page you are told that it is blocked and under which category. It is worth noting that whilst you can opt out of these filters, you cannot opt out of their logging of your traffic to blocked sites.

A Tory MP commented to similar effect the other day:

&gt; Tory MP Nigel Mills, a member of the work and pensions select committee, criticised the [Trussel] Trust’s views on benefits.

&gt; ‘For those in genuine need, the benefits system gives people a decent level of help,’ he said. ‘I don’t think any of my constituents are clamouring for us to increase benefits. [[toxic cite](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2606573/Food-bank-charity-misleading-public-Claim-1m-need-food-parcels-just-self-promotion.html)]

Even outside our ruling classes, the illusion that ""everything's all right with the system"" seems to persist.

There was a discussion on here about this a few months back and /u/FakePlasticShrimp started quizzing some guy on benefits - some guy with ATOS hassles - about his condition.

Now Fakie (I can't remember his new nick) is admittedly a fucking idiot, but he comes from north of Watford and describes himself as ""working class"" - I'd have imagined him to know, or have met, the odd person who depends on benefits.

Instead it was all like ""if you're really in that condition, we should be looking after you"" and ""if it's really so slow and painful and difficult for you to walk to the end of the street, then you should have some help"" - it was painfully obvious that Shrimpy's mind was blown, and that he couldn't imagine that someone genuinely deserving was being stitched up by the state. He was struggling to believe and resolve this guy's testimony.

I really think that most people's perception of the world is influenced more by their own illusions than by reality. You grow up with your mum telling you that you work hard and go to university then you'll get a good job, and that if bad things happen then there's a social safety net - when half of what you've been told turns out to be true, I guess it's natural to assume that the other half is, too.",0,1398284240,null,0,false,0,ch06yl8,t3_23o99n,t1_ch06yl8,t1_cgzt6j4,null,1433489144,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt; None of the other organisations have the power to dictate laws

The WTO does affect national policy in that we must craft our domestic trade and industry policy, our tax policy and our labour to comply with various agreements. In terms of the we have ceded our right to declare war to the UN - any war must be conduced in compliance with international law. They aren't quite the same as the EU but the same argument can be applied. The rules between nations are by definition domestic legal issues for both nations. The WTO has been working to erase trade barriers around the world using the same language and the same pattern as the EU. The EU has gone further but no EU law has no international significance. Every regulation and directive is made with an international element in mind, normally to ensure regulations are the same everywhere in Europe so that a product or service does not have be in compliance with two regulatory standards as this discourages trade. Nothing is done without international reasons: from a lot of people you would get the sense the EU passes special laws for the UK but nothing is regulated without an aim at improving trade and people's ability to live and work freely in the EU. I would like to see better definition of EU competencies but not the destruction of common trading regulations that have made the UK prosperous. 

&gt;we are unable to run our own trade deals with out the consent of the EU

And being part of the most powerful economic bloc weakens us how? Being free of EU safeguards with strong ties to the commonwealth didn't help us when our currency basically failed in 1967. Meanwhile in 2014, inside the EU, we are about to conclude the biggest trade deal in history with the US and the EU is negotiating another with India. Do you really think the UK on it's own would have the same persuasive power as the entire European continent?  I don't believe it would: it's a law of economics that size means more negotiating power. That's why public healthcare providers provide drugs cheaper than a private system because it can negotiate more aggressively because it knows it's the only game in town and it has the upper hand and the consumer gets a better deal. Is it any wonder that Australia and New Zealand want to create a customs union and a single market of their own. They understand the value of economic integration over isolation in the hope that something else will come along. That is a weak position. 

&gt;UKIP wants to be a part of Europe

As far as I can tell it clearly doesn't. If UKIP doesn't want the freedom to move around Europe and want's the EU to treat us like a anywhere else in the world that's does suggest a desire to remain part of Europe. If UKIP want to force companies to chose to headquarters their businesses here or in Paris because it want's a ban on free movement of capital then not only will companies chose Paris or Munich but they will see the UK no more as the helpful, English speaking, common law having window into Europe but instead a back water to the side. No doubt in a UKIP Britain we would abolish the metric system and remove any regulations that might make trade between the EU and a castaway Britain easier. From the last 10 years of frothing at the mouth about harmonisation of regulations I would hope they wouldn't just turn around and say 'Oh but were all for trade so let's keep all these helpful regulations that make trade with the EU simple, mostly costless and easy for small business' but that seems to be what some UKIP people are now telling me. We're all for making trade free and easy with the EU except when they come up with the ideas. 

&gt;UKIP is in favour of...immigration of skilled labour.

This is genuinely news to me. Wasn't it only a few years ago their manifesto declared that UKIP would shut the border entirely for 5 years? I guess they must have changed that to seem more electable. 

&gt;How can you reform something that is non negotiable?

The EU has stated clearly that it seeks to avoid negative economic effects of mass immigration. In fact when David Cameron made his silly accusations (that seem to have been forgotten now) about benefit tourism the EU asked the government to provide evidence and if such evidence was provided **it would act to change the law** and prevent it. But naturally no such evidence arose as became obvious because the government was largely making the whole thing up. Presenting it as if the EU doesn't give a shit is not true; no evidence has yet been provided of negative economic effects due solely to EU immigration.  In fact the government's own studies found that they were broadly positive for the economy because they worked, paid taxes, bought stuff and didn't claim benefits.

It'd be nice if new support would honestly say that they're just casually following football for the first time and that they really like LFC, but lets face it, when it comes to supporting a team, we all just want to be a part of something and share that feeling with others, and that's all these new fans are trying to do.

As a humanist, I assure you it's not. From a cultural POV I don't care if we are within the UK or UI. I want whats best for Northern Ireland: I believe this is within the UK.

You ask why we haven't posted information on our stance: it relates to the fact we want to discuss real politics, not the constitutional issue. Therefore: to post large pieces on the constitutional issue would be hypocritical (in my mind). However, we have attended a few debates on the issue set up by Sinn Fein: the main issue is the difference between the amount we give to the UK, and the amount they return. We live off the UK: with an over-sized public sector etc. I believe this is commonly accepted. It was within the debate I attended. You place forward many great stats about the ROI, which I applaud them for! But my issue stands that when I speak with people from the ROI: they inform me they couldn't afford us. Just because Ireland is recovering doesn't mean it can afford us with NHS etc being upheld. I'm selfish you could say: When they inform me that their would have to be cuts I back off! P.s. For me these are the best people to judge!

I will admit to not having your knowledge on the issue (I'm rather busy atm but will try create a more in-depth argument at a later date): but any information I have received to date has led me to believe that NI is better from an economic POV within the UK.

Let me tell you about SAINT George.  Not Mister George, not King George, not ""that bloke down the street"" George, but SAINT George.  The highest honour that could be bestowed upon him within his time period.

You see, one day the Roman Empire decided that their Gods were better than all other Gods.  St George, who was already a fucking hardnut Roman warrior general, decided that being told what to worship was fucking wank mate.  He thought that he would tell his trusted friend the Emperor that he was too hard for other people to dictate that shit towards him.

So do you know what happened?  He was tortured to death because he was such a hard bastard that he refused to lie despite people sticking pokers up his arse.

For a normal guy, this would be enough to cement them as an arse kicking bastard who isn't going to take any of your colonist shit.  But for St George?  Not enough.

When the Crusades happened about 1000 years ago and the English went to the Middle East to give some of those Muslim conquerers a damn good thrashing, there was a place called Antioch that nobody could sack.  Antioch was important as a trading post and gave some English lads food in their bellies.  Problem was, nobody could take it.

Nobody of course apart from arse kicking Saint George, who died hundreds of years earlier and even as a ghost inspired English lads to go and break their shit up.  St George was so fucking hard that hundreds of years after he died he became a ghost and was still giving those Johnny Foreigners a good spanking.

Over the hundreds of years since our Kings and army has always said that St George protects them.  He ain't some bullshit ghost like in your local pub, he's the type of ghost that leads fucking armies in Crusades.  

We now look at the cross of the Christ that he represented and the blood red for the life that he gave.  This is a guy who fought for freedom of worship 1000 years ago.  A guy who said that the powers that be can fuck themselves and we will be dignified in our beliefs.  The red cross of England is coloured red by the millions who shed blood for that idea of St George, that tyrannical political figures will never defeat that spirit.  The spirit of St George.  The spirit of England.  We look at our red cross and see the blood of hundreds of generations showing us the cost of our innocent white flag.  There's a reason why the red cross on white is seen worldwide as a symbol for the protection of the innocents in the Red Cross, an organisation that can cross any border in any warzone.  I don't see no fucking stars on their symbol.  

I see a Turk who fought for the Roman Empire and died in Palestine as the absolute symbol of our country.  Millions around the world look at the cross of St George and feel that they could fulfil their dreams by moving here.  I welcome every single one of them.  I welcome every single person who looks at the George's cross and wants to share in its values wherever they are from.  No persecution due to religion or creed or colour.  The adoption and welcoming of other's cultures and people's that we adopt as our own.

St George was a great man and England was built upon his myth.  You fucking people and your overly cynical attitude think it's ""cool"" to hate St George like you hate everything else.

I wear the colours of George and the message with pride and an honour that has stretched back for two thousand years.

true,PTRJK,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"I think there are other ways of going about it, rather than having 3 more *super* carriers.

We have 6 logistic/transport ships, of which there are 3 different designs each suited to a slightly different role:

1 x [HMS Ocean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Apache_Helicopter_Takes_off_from_HMS_Ocean_During_Operation_Ellamy_MOD_45153052.jpg) - Specialises in carrying helicopters

3 x [Bay-class landing ship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Govan_Shipbuilders_-_geograph.org.uk_-_465129.jpg) - Specialises amphibious operations/logistics

2 x [Albion-class landing platform dock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:HMS_Bulwark.jpg) - Specialises carrying troops and landing craft

Bare in mind that the general rule for warships is that half will be in maintenance for about half the year. So really, we only have 'HMS Ocean' for about half the year, one 'Albion-class' for the whole year and about two 'Bay-class' landing ships for the whole year. It would literally look like [this](http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/observation-post/BW09-0049-048.jpg).

The French have the right idea by building the ""Swiss Army Knife"" of ships [(Mistral-class)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistral_class_landing_platform_dock), which can do all those roles. So they can build half as many ships (cutting costs), while having the same, if not *greater* capability than us.

So, what we could do is replace those 6 ships with 4 Spanish ['Juan Carlos I' amphibious assault ships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra-class_landing_helicopter_dock), like the Australians did (bought 2). Not only would that save us money but we would effectively have four more aircraft carriers. It would *quadruple* the current number of ships that can launch (fixed/rotor wing) aircraft, increase the number of landing ships by a quarter and double the number of assault ships with landing craft.

I don't want this to get political but I do wonder what Labour were thinking, getting us such bad value for money? Was it ""more work for the ship builders""? 

Anyway, time to go outside.

I should certainly hope Daniel Levy has plans within plans anchored by strategies and iron clad assurances. I really couldn't care less how brilliant those plans are.  The only thing that matters is the finish.  Plans mean nothing.

 The game is about glory, and glory only comes when you execute your plan no matter how many times you get punched in the face.  Think Levy was planning on Moyes getting fired?  Doesn't matter if he did or didn't.  I don't want to hear about how great the plan would have been if it wasn't for...

true,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"I thought the report would be a lot shorter... Bugger. ;)

The report is critical of Neoclassical orthodoxy in academic study and in the profession as a whole.

It suggests moving towards a multidisciplinary approach, allowing other sciences and subjects to contribute. Social theory, behavioural theory and biological underpinnings of microeconomic activities should be defined by other disciplines. Not based on the assumptions of how people behave made by economists. Big data and quantitative method should be the cornerstone of informed economic theory.

Further to this, the INET group is working towards a discussion-based approach to theory presentation. It talks about what policy was implemented in various real world situations, the results and discusses them both with the focus on many different subjects to explain the outcomes. This builds a breadth of understanding as well as teaching historical context.

This breadth of understanding is converted into critical thinking when approaching economic problems, real or imagined. Again, a restatement of the idea that knowledge of many subjects is important.

This train of thought runs through the entire critique of Manchester's Economic syllabus, and is gently applied to the subject in both academic and professional circles. The evidence is compelling and [Picketty's treatise on economic equality](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Capital-Twenty-First-Century-Thomas-Piketty/dp/067443000X) should stand on it's own as a good example of unorthodox economic thinking - unorthodox in that it is based in reality.

I'm just finishing my degree and honestly, I feel ignorant of many aspects of economics. Perhaps my disengagement is down to studying so many theories that have literally zero grounding in reality - interesting but unrealistic. It's exciting to read that so many fresh eyes will be able to contribute to pushing it forward into a broader, more robust and cohesive discipline.

Yes. But you made it 5mil vs 53mil of England. This is a EU Parliament election. Why are you worried about England, specifically, in an EU election. There are other groupings of constituencies on much larger population areas.

&gt;The laws made, those voted into power, foreign relations, budget decisions and so on.

Thats largely Westminster, not the EUP, which is what this polling data is for.

&gt;With the English making up the overwhelming numeric majority what they vote counts most in a democratic country.

You've lost me here. The various seats awarded to the regions of England is very small within the EU. Again, there are larger countries to worry about.

&gt;so even if all of Scotland voted for one party to govern the UK all it would take to negate that is a third of London voting the other way.

But this isn't about voting for the UK. It's about voting for the European Parliament.

OP, I really do get your point but I don't think you needed to get so defensive/aggressive about it, it's a bit too ranty and heroic even though I agree with you. 

In my opinion I say welcome one, welcome all, everybody is a new fan at some point and those who truly have fallen in love with the club will stay and contribute and those who are only here to share in the glory will soon move on.

With that said though I do see what people are complaining about, I just think the newer members haven't had time to get a handle of the tone of the sub so they mistakenly assume this is like /r/soccer and you can say and post anything you want. I think the long term subscribers are just a little concerned that with the growth of the sub the tone will change and we'll start to become a cesspool like /r/gunners or /r/reddevils so its understandable.

The amount of cringey post and comments has sky rocketed, particularly Hillsborough which was ridiculous (like the guy who said he was a united fan but recently became a liverpool fan because it was the 25th anniversary and he was going to get the names of the 96 tattooed on his arm), or the crazy amount of 'former' united fans that suddenly realised they were actually Liverpool fans all along, or the 'look what this united/arsenal/chelsea/city fan said' posts.

I think the best thing to do is to maybe just create a New subscriber guidelines post which is just a quick list of things that new fans can quickly read to get a feel for the sub, just things like;

* This is r/liverpoolfc NOT r/anti-united/chelsea/city/arsenal
* Dont create posts telling people you are new fan or why you became a fan
* Reel it in, we get you are passionate, we all are, you dont have to over do it (in particular using YNWA and JFT96 at the end of everypost and sentence)
* *this*, *this* and *this* is considered cringey try not to post/comment like it

Yet, It is annoying to see Wilma Washing machine from Calcutta supporting Liverpool because we are close to winning the League, given I have supported Liverpool and not once complained about any manager or any player other than Babel and Torres all my life, even when Roy had the club, I still believed in him, I just stick by the club, and there have been bad times, very bad times where the players look like they want to be doing anything but kicking a ball, so now everyone jumps on the bandwagon you are like, WTF? But it is what it is I suppose, those people will probably stop supporting us if we end up in a poor run of form, and In general I detest being horrible to anyone, internet or otherwise. 

However.... You gotta be more thick skinned if you are bothered about being called names on the internet to be honest. I have supported Liverpool all of my life, but yet I joined this Reddit weeks ago, So there have bound to be people think I am just another glory hunter, but I really don't care, Nor do I care that I am not from the city, because if its not Glory hunting to moan about its fans out side the city, I think if you want to prove yourself as a member of the community you gotta stick at it you know? don't just shy away because a random person called you a glory hunter, prove them wrong and be here all season and next, add stuff to the discussions, because of course posts like ""YEAH MAN I AM WASHING MACHINE I LOVE LIVERPOOL I AM A NEW SUPPORTER"" are bound to get some negative response. 

It couldn't be more simpler really, If you are a red, you are a red, don't let any one tell you any different. 

There are two sides to this though as I said. For example I chose to support the JacksonVIlle Jaguars last season as I was getting into NFL and liked the look of their team from the game they played at Wembley(I think it was) And whilst they did not do so well, I still would not have gone on the  Jacksonville jags reddit and expected everyone to be warm to me.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"I was born and raised in and around Merseyside, grew up supporting Liverpool because my Dad did. But my Dad was the first person in my family to really follow football particularly - my grandparents either don't care for sport or follow rugby (granddad is a huge St Helens fan). Only reason my Dad supports the club is because his next-door neighbour started taking him to Anfield to watch the game when he was little, and he grew up supporting the club through the 70s and 80s when we were the dominant team in English and European football. I don't think he was a glory hunter, but it's hard to say for sure if he'd definitely have been quite as enthused and become a huge fan if we were the equivalent of Tranmere or something at the time. And even though I was raised as a red, I don't personally remember caring all that much until the year we won the treble when I was eleven years old. 

Fact is, even local LFC fans are supporting Liverpool over Everton or Tranmere - why? Probably because we were more successful and glamorous when they started following football. Or because their parents did, but even then it's more than possible that they're basically just second generation fans of people who started supporting because we were a successful club. A lot of people will make a big deal of the ""hurr I'm Scouse I hate all these glory hunting London fans"" or whatever but they're not necessarily any better except that they happened to live near the successful team they support.

Unless someone really does live right next to Anfield (and on the opposite side to Goodison Park) it's really hard to argue that anyone didn't first start supporting the club because they were successful. Maybe the only other reasonable argument you get a lot is along the lines of ""I support LFC because I'm Finnish and Sami Hyypia and Jari Litmanen were awesome when I was a kid"". But even then, the only reason we had the best players from a given nation is because we were successful enough to sign them at the time.

You're right in that why we became fans isn't what makes us fans. What makes us fans is going through the whole experience together, and keeping the faith and passion for the club even when the performances on the pitch are far from inspiring. Fans from the likes of Singapore and Australia who are having to stay up to ridiculous hours to watch us draw games with the likes of Wolves and Fulham in shit seasons - they're going to far greater lengths as fans than the vast majority of local reds that I know.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;The WTO does affect national policy in that we must craft our domestic trade and industry policy, our tax policy and our labour to comply with various agreements

The key word being agreements. The WTO cannot write legislation for the UK. Legislation being the highest form of decision making there is. 

&gt;In terms of the we have ceded our right to declare war to the UN 

The UN doesn't prevent anyone from declaring war, it just seeks to prevent wars being declared unjustly. such as in the case of the Iraq war, which did not have the mandate of the UN, and yet still happened. 

&gt;any war must be conduced in compliance with international law

""Must"" is a strong word, as I mentioned, the Iraq war happened without a UN mandate.

&gt;Every regulation and directive is made with an international element in mind, normally to ensure regulations are the same everywhere in Europe so that a product or service does not have be in compliance with two regulatory standards as this discourages trade. 

Any argument for compliance that can be made in the EU can also be made of the rest of the world. Why does Europe need to isolate itself? Why not work for global agreement on regulations? 


&gt;And being part of the most powerful economic bloc weakens us how?

Because we are not the ones at the trade talks, its an EU representative who doesn't have the best interests of the UK in mind, he has the best interest of the EU. What are those interests? Who knows, he's certainly not an elected official. Surely trade talks would be more prosperous for the UK if we could actually have an official in the room talking up the things we can do and focusing attention in particular on our country, rather than an unelected official talking about the benefits of 28 different nations?


&gt;No doubt in a UKIP Britain we would abolish the metric system 

Any source for that or did you just pull that from the UKIP election manifesto that you haven't read...

&gt;This is genuinely news to me.

Then you haven't been paying attention, but don't let that get in the way of a good rant. 

&gt;The EU has stated clearly that it seeks to avoid negative economic effects of mass immigration.

That's the funniest thing you've said here. You've just made the point that the EU exist to make trade more cost effective for the EU between other large trading partners such as the US and China. The EU exists to make it cheaper to do business within it. How do you make it cheaper to do business? you cut costs. What's one of the best ways to cut costs? Lower your labour costs. The low skilled worker flooding the EU, suppressing wages, keeping costs of businesses down. That's the EU working exactly as it is intended to. Don't be ashamed of these negative economic costs to the lowly poor people of Europe, this is your plan in action, be proud of it. Because of their sacrifice, the EU can now compete with far east sweat shops and slave labour.

true,nuyw,null,null,"&gt; Just so you know, UKIP are fine with gay marrage.

It was widely reported that they dropped their opposition to it after the law came into force, but this appears to have been down to a rogue spokesperson sending out statements on Farage's behalf without checking with him.  I believe some bigwigs in the party (including a couple of MEPs and the head of UKIP in Wales IIRC) have said they are against same-sex marriage in principle, but Farage has consistently refused to say whether he would support it if we left the ECHR.

&gt; They are just against religious places of worship being forced to marry gay couples or facing EU court action.

We have a long history of giving religious organisations exemptions from equality laws - they are generally free to discriminate on the basis of people's sex, gender, religion, sexual orientation and marital status in cases where other organisations are not.  Neither the EU nor the European Court of Human Rights has ever had a problem with this.  Many other European countries have had same-sex marriage for some time, and none of them have forced private religious organisations to marry same-sex couples.

If anything, the ECHR provides protection to religious organisations who are opposed to same-sex marriage, since the courts might well rule that if the government did try to force them to do same-sex marriages, they would be violating Article 9.

This whole thing about the ECHR was purely a convenient excuse.  It was the only remotely convincing reason anyone could think of to oppose same-sex marriage that wasn't plainly rooted in bigotry.  Anyway, even if there was a serious risk of courts deciding against churches, why should the right of churches to decide how they conduct their weddings trump the right of LGBT people to be able to get married at all?",0,1398287601,null,0,false,0,ch08qak,t3_23rdvw,t1_ch08qak,t1_ch00h1a,null,1433489978,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,Leonichol,cnty-uk,Geordie in exile (Surrey),"&gt;When talking about the EU you should bear in mind that Scotland only has a say as a smaller constituent part of the UK. 

Well that's not really true. The Scottish EU Constituency is entirely separate than the rest of the UK. Scotland returns its own MEP's. If said MEP's decide to join a cross-border party then that is their (and your) prerogative. Said MEPs sit inside the EU parliament representing Scotland... not anywhere else.

&gt;With talk of Scottish independence it's unsure of whether an independent Scotland would even be given access to the EU because of certain political ramifications

I'm not sure how this is relevant. If Scotland gains independence from the UK, then its 'access' is likely only a matter of time. Then, as now, it will elect an appropriate number of MEPs based on its population size. Again, as now, these MEPs are free to join any cross-border party, whether this is English, Polish, or even French.

I originally wanted to make a suit of maille but gave up when I ran out of money for steel gardening wire (to make the rings) so decided to butcher what I'd already made and put it to other projects. It's pretty neat, there are a bunch of different patterns and aesthetically pleasing items to make.

Aside from that, we're definitely better off today, I think.  As with most things in life, the internet makes it better.  Yes, there is a lot of discussion on this subreddit that someone having watched a lot of the classic series would roll their eyes at, but that's fine.  We were all new viewers at some point and it can be a lot to take in.

The access to news, the theories and debates, the availability of webisodes etc., the ability to revisit old episodes at will via streaming, it's all made for a much richer experience.

If there's one failing with the new era that concerns me, it's the lack of appreciation for the campiness that has been a primary element of Doctor Who right from the beginning.  Doctor Who has always suffered in the past from weak budgets, re-used props and slapped together costumes but we didn't care because we watched it for the stories and used our imaginations.

Nowadays, you have people saying only start watching with S5 because ""it's too hard to watch"" for new viewers otherwise.  I think this attitude seems to go hand-in-hand with everyone that wants to see every last detail about Gallifrey, every last detail about the Time War, every last detail about every element ever discussed in the show etc. 

Imagination has always been the most important element of the story because the Doctor lives in a world that we shouldn't even be able to comprehend.  The campiness was ok because it reminded us of that.

A serious answer would be Mascherano since he seems to send out some feelers our way and getting a broader squad to deal with CL and league cups might be a good move. Out of nostalgia I'd say Alonso, and somewhere buried deep inside is a small torch for Fernando Torres. 

I think Dirk Kuyt would also be a welcome reunion although he's a lot slower than he was and Henderson sort of fills his 'engine' role.

true,Turtle_Blues,null,null,"&gt; I really think that most people's perception of the world is influenced more by their own illusions than by reality.

Yes, I think that's a lot of the issue. People *believe* there is a system in place and, as long as it helps some of the people some of the time, it's easy to pass off the glaring inequalities and problems within said system as it being riddled with ""scroungers"" - or, as we've been talking about here, to rebrand poverty as personal failure, thus demonising the poor as idiots and/or feckless fools reaping their own whirlwinds.  

I've been below the poverty line for the majority of my life - before I got sick, we were home-nursing my grandfather, and I'm currently also caring for my mother (she needs help following cancer surgery, but she's also technically my carer, so it gets complex) - and I constantly find people really have no idea what it's like. Not trying to throw a sob story, but it is true that I lose most of the friends I make because I can't socialise like ""normal"" people do (it's either too expensive, or my health craps out), and I have little to none of the trappings in everyday life that many people take for granted, like new clothes, going to a hairdresser, having holidays etc. I can't even manage basic household chores properly, though that's beside the point... because that's something else the DWP don't take into account when deciding if you're ""sick enough"" to need help.

Money aside, the social exclusion thing is a very real blight associated with the benefits system as it stands, and the practical realities of that really are beyond a lot of people [in my experience]. 

Obviously, there isn't a limitless pot of cash to help everyone... but I believe there can be better management of the resources that *do* exist, and an improvement in the attitudes of people who deal with those of us stuck on the bottom rung. I remember trying to get help from SSAFA for my grandfather (he was an ex-sailor). He was on permanent oxygen, slowing dying of osteoporosis and COPD, and we had no outside nursing help at all. I learned to do lung drainage massage when I was eleven. There was little to no support for carers at all then - that's changing now, with more charity input and more public awareness of how unbelievably hard it is to care for people at home. 

But, of course, that doesn't extend to disability benefits per se, and when I see things like the DWP wasting huge amounts of money on their abortive computer system, the mess they've made of trying to roll out Universal Credit, and of course the sheer volume of appeals related to ESA and DLA that the Atos system is generating - last time I heard a statistic, there were over a hundred and forty thousand cases backlogged, each one of those costing several thousands in court hours, paperwork etc. - it appalls me that there is not more public outcry over it. 

The thing is, as you point out, people are comfortable believing that the safety net is there for the deserving, and the ones who complain must be entitled whiners and/or scroungers. The fact that the system is not just institutionally unfair but *integrally corrupt* is - as you say - mind-blowing for a lot of people. 

I don't know what the answer is. I like to think the idea of basic income might gain traction, because it would wipe out a lot of the nit-picking the DWP currently do regarding permutations of what is considered ""work"" and so forth... but it's a way off.

Face it, the idea of ""British"" culture belongs to the past. Where I live, the only reminder that this is Britain is the weather. Britain is a multi-cultural society now and it is about time that our minority views were given some representation under the law. 

I fear for what would happen if UKIP came to power, because look at how we are already treated now by the government; the houses we are given are small and dehumanizing, the money we get is barely enough for food, and even so it is low quality, and I have had relatives turned away at customs simply because they wanted to use the NHS.

In what way can you claim to be a multicultural society if you are turning away ill people at the border simply because they want treatment?

I am told ""well the NHS is for the British"". How racist is that? The UK has a history of plundering others resources and countries, as far as I am concerned the British taxpayer should pay for the treatment of people in these countries.

I look forward to seeing the population of my fellow muslims rise however. Hopefully we will be given representation under the law at some point. It is ridiculous that when we try to have a conversation about Islamic values we are told that they do not belong here because ""this is Britain"".

Again, more Islamophobia, more racism. 

Britain is a truly multi-cultural society and each culture should be allowed its own customs and religious laws. You can say this is Britain all you want but where I live English is rarely spoken and we celebrate our Pakistani culture because we are proud of it.

I am tired of being oppressed by these ideas of ""Britishness"". I have been here for 2 years and I am just as British as anyone else. It is racist to say that just because I am a Pakistani muslim that wasn't born here, that I am not British.

It makes our forwardline drop to our side of the halfwayline and it's hard to get control of the game. 

As I said, I think Skrtel is our best defender and I would rate him at about 6 in our last game. 6 being right above average. Wouldn't be right to rate him higher when we let Norwich score two goals.

true,LFCfanatic999,lfc99,,"I see what you did there. Perhaps I didn't make myself clear enough or didn't use enough foresight to anticipate this sort of follow up. My apologies. My reference to the United supporters is though my own personal experience and not typical. Maybe I should have put up a huge disclaimer to avoid confusion.


The funny thing is that I agree with what you say, but I think the direction of it is not quite aligning. I have zero problems with supporters of other clubs and enjoy good, solid, knowledgeable football discussion with the vast majority of them. I think you have to be an extremely closeminded fuck if you only talk about Liverpool solely with other Liverpool supporters. In regards to my own experience, Premier League football was very, very new at the time and ESPN2 just started to bust out with a regular ""Monday Night Football"" segment back in the day. That was their first foray into the US market exclusively besides Champions League which was also shown. I, myself, had Irish and English roommates in college which fed me a steady diet of Liverpool, in San Antonio, Texas of all places back in '96, to which my 'fanaticism' grew. The after seeing the second 4-3 match it was final. 


But I digress. People at the time who started to watch other teams naturally wanted to find out who their newly supported teams rivals were. Obviously with United making their Champions League run started to get more of a following and the byproduct of that was Liverpool getting more recognition for whatever reason. People who supported Manchester had no idea who or where Manchester were nor name five players in the squad no less, but were happy to take on the false persona of a yob who travels around in a firm and throw stick at anyone wearing a Liverpool top. The ""figurative tribe"" attitude that you speak of. Sort of like a wannabe who would have loved to been the subject of a Donal MacIntyre documentary. The shit just got old and when they started to throw out Hillsborough chants just because without any rhyme or reason that was the end of it. Fortunately, this didn't happen too often, but the aggressive territorial mentality to anyone in a different shirt was common occurrence for the naïve and unfortunately because Liverpool didn't quite make it to the pinnacle of the Premiership, the club was fodder to the ignorance. That's probably the reference of my bitterness. It's different now I think for a lot of people and that's probably a good thing.


I always felt that as Liverpool supporters we were different. In all of my travels around the US, Europe, and Asia, back then you'd get stopped for wearing a Liverpool top and kill from five minutes to having a heavy bevvy session with your new found friend just talking about the club. That was fucking magical. That was fucking support like no other. The citizens of Liverpool are top class and I never have a bad time when I visit. And yes, I honestly love to eat scouse and have way too many quad-vods at Slaters. Even when we played in the Official Supporters Club at Anfield last year, its just brilliant to see supporters from all over the world celebrate the club on the pitch. Of course, after Istanbul things changed and with each success the club grew. I'll be honest and I think some of the romance and connection is dissipating. The Liverpool tops on the streets that you see aren't uncommon anymore and some of the exclusivity is gone but I'll happily trade that for progress and growth of the club and I think all of us would. But I still bitterly miss how it was.

3) Relegation is a danger for every small club in the PL.
The league is made up of the top 7 teams:
 - Chelsea
 - Liverpool
 - Manchester United
 - Manchester City
 - Everton
 - Tottenham
 - Arsenal

These teams pretty much always finish in the top 7 and relegation is never on their mind. However, for the other 13 teams, it is always a fear.
The 3 newly promoted teams:
 - Hull City
 - Crystal Palace
 - Cardiff City

These teams usually most likely to go down as they are coming from a lower league and often bring in a lot of new players. Obviously the 3 new teams don't always get relegated but they are usually underdogs in the league. For the other 10 teams, relegation is still a fear as the league is unpredictable. 

Swansea specifically shouldn't be worrying about relegation but this has been a strange year. After playing in Europa League, we struggled to find our form in the league which is why we are not currently in a top 10 position. Losing our manager didn't help either although we have looked better since Monk has been in charge, even though we have not picked up too many points. Next season, with Europa League missing and only the league, FA Cup and Capital One Cup to worry about, we should be playing a lot better, and hopefully will have the players to cover our injuries.

&gt;

&gt;__Yomp__ is [Royal Marines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines) [slang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang) describing a long-distance march carrying full kit. The origin of the word is unclear (one suggestion would interpret it as an [acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym) of *Your Own Marching Pace* ). It was popularized by journalistic coverage in 1982 during the [Falklands War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falklands_War). It has been compared to the term *yump* used in rally-driving in the sense of ""to leave the ground when taking a crest at speed"", apparently a variant of *[jump](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jump)*. 

&gt;[British Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army) slang for the same thing is ""TAB"", of equally unknown origin (one suggestion would interpret it as an [acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym) of Tactical Advance to Battle ).

&gt;The most famous yomp of recent times was during the 1982 [Falklands War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falklands_War). After disembarking from ships at [San Carlos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Carlos,_Falkland_Islands) on [East Falkland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Falkland), on 21 May 1982, Royal Marines and members of the [Parachute Regiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute_Regiment_(United_Kingdom\)) yomped (and tabbed) with their equipment across the islands, covering 56 miles (90 km)  in three days carrying 80 pounds (36 kg)  loads.

No. This article title is misleading.

""Mr Coupland **believes** this was in retaliation after he asked for her to be removed from the case because he felt she had acted unprofessionally by contacting one of his character witnesses during the custody proceedings.""

She withdrew her allegations; we have absolutely no fucking clue as to why. You're asking the cps to prove something that is pure conjecture without a shred of evidence. Furthermore, the charge of misconduct in public office is seldom used because it's extremely difficult to prove. 

He feels she deliberately set out to persecute him, but there's no proof of that. He also wants to sue the police for arresting him. Sounds to me like he has a persecution complex.

This summer, BR will be given a transfer kitty of £60m (rumour) which (if true) is exceptional, but, Rodgers has to use that money wisely to not only make our starting 11 stronger but to add some depth to our team and make the bench stronger. I am terrified during games, not only because of our title hopes but because if we are ever in the situation where we need to score and Suarez/Sturridge/Sterling are not on form, we have literally no one to come off the bench and be a viable attacking option, no disrespect to Aspas but I don't think he's LFC standard. FSG and Brendan Rodgers need to act now and in the summer to challenge in the years to come, remember, our rivals will only get stronger as well. Now that we have guaranteed Champions League football next season we need to make sure that we retain it and that ""Top 4"" is a minimum requirement for LFC. Back in our glory days of the 70's and 80's finishing second was an absolute disaster, that's how high expectations for LFC were.

true,ricecows,lfc99,,"You can't choose who you fall in love with. Can you blame people falling in love with the club after this season?

Imagine a person, probably american, watching football for the first time this season. He follows the Premier League, the supposedly best league in the world. His mates told him that.

Then he sees the pre-season. The big teams are named and could win. Some clubs ""can reach 5th"", Liverpool being one of them.

He watches some games. Doesn't pick a team, but watches the games people tell him to watch, or whatever is on Sky.

One day he sees this team, Liverpool, play incredible football. ""Hey didn't they finish 7th and are fighting for 5th?"" he asks him self.

He starts to follow the team. Watches us win and lose. Watches the other games as well, with ""the big teams"". Watches the fall of United - something he can't quite grasp, but still finds odd. He sees Chelsea. ""They are title contenders?"" he asks his mates. ""But the games are so boring!"". He watches City, but can't feel like supporting them because ""they bought their success, right?"". Arsenal seems like an interesting team, but all his mates follow this team, and he likes to be ""the other guy"".. Plus, they lack that X factor.. The players are good, but no one is brilliant..

In comes Suarez, back from his ban. Our american is fascinated. Surely this guy must be better than Messi?

He watches us sit top of the table on christmas, only to lose to the two big title contenders. Suddenly we're fighting for 4th. ""Interesting, this dark horse called 'Liverpool'"" he tells him self.

He then follows us, the dark horse (or dog or whatever The Special One wants to call us). He starts to enjoy this, but won't call him self a fan.. He just watches the games, right?

Que our win over Man City. Our friend can't believe it - against all the odds, top of the table still, beating the big spenders.


How can you blame a guy, for falling in love with a club, that against all odds rises from 7th to their way to the league title. A club with rich history and amazing fans, that sing and chant at games. A club with fantastic players, who weren't super stars before the season, but sure look like it now.

&gt;

&gt;The __Fosse Way__ was a [Roman road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_road) in England that linked [Exeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exeter) (*[Isca Dumnoniorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isca_Dumnoniorum)*) in [South West England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West_England) to [Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln,_Lincolnshire) (*[Lindum Colonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindum_Colonia)*) in [Lincolnshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincolnshire), via [Ilchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilchester) (*[Lindinis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindinis)*), [Bath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath,_Somerset) (*[Aquae Sulis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquae_Sulis)*), [Cirencester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirencester) (*[Corinium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinium_Dobunnorum)*) and [Leicester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester) (*[Ratae Corieltauvorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratae_Corieltauvorum)*).

&gt;It joined [Akeman Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akeman_Street) and [Ermin Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ermin_Street) at Cirencester, crossed [Watling Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watling_Street) at *Venonis* ([High Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Cross,_Leicestershire)) south of Leicester, and joined [Ermine Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ermine_Street) at Lincoln.

&gt;The word *Fosse* is derived from the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) *fossa*, meaning *ditch*. For the first few decades after the [Roman invasion of Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_invasion_of_Britain) in AD 43, the Fosse Way marked the western frontier of Roman rule in [Iron Age Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Iron_Age). It is possible that the road began as a defensive ditch that was later filled in and converted into a road, or possibly a defensive ditch ran alongside the road for at least some of its length.

true,JohnPeel,null,null,"There's no affiliation between UKIP and the EDL. The EDL are also not a political organisation. But really the less said about them the better.

The hate is mostly fabricated outrage due to conflating an anti mass immigration sentiment with being racist. This view point is then ""supported"" by quoting people who claim to be UKIP supporters or are UKIP Councillors. However, you basically have to be a bit weird to be a Councillor in the first place because it's a totally thankless job. There was a Tory Councillor recently who made some bizarre comments saying people should enjoy being raped. Essentially this is akin to saying that the entire Tory party are rapists. There was also a Labour Councillor suspended for homophobic remarks, so therefore the Labour party are homophobic. You get the idea.

And then we have the Harman/Hewitt paedophile thing and the Lib Dems have the whole Cyril Smith thing. The BBC are also wrapped up in this so whilst reporting on these pedophile scandals among the political class is something very much in the public interest, the BBC do not want to mention it because of Saville. So instead they have to focus on the meteoric rise of UKIP.

Note how you won't see any mention at all of anything aside from UKIP in political news. Nothing about Maria Miller (Leveson by extension) or Cyril Smith.

So to conclude the hate is really an attempt to lump UKIP in with the criminal establishment but the worst they can come up with is the racism angle, I'm not sure where that falls in the hierarchy of Bad Things™ but I think they're assuming it is equal to being a paedophile.

You might also have noticed the ""no"" campaign for independence is being fought in a similarly negative way. Negative campaigns have failed every time they have been tried in recent history so I'm not sure why people are shocked that UKIP poll ratings are stable, or the Scottish discontent with the ""no"" campaign.",1,1398296995,null,0,false,0,ch0d5ia,t3_23s9f2,t1_ch0d5ia,t1_ch0bm8t,null,1433492121,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,L__McL,,Who would win us the Cup? Tim sure would.,"I love Weimann, I'm a huge fan and since he broke through he's been one of my favourite players.

Is Weimann good enough for Villa?

Yes. Definitely yes. Of course, he's had a poor season but on form he's great. In the win against City he was instrumental. He and Benteke crucified Liverpool last season. In the few occasions we get more than 1 minute discussion of MotD it's always about how lethal the front three of Weimann, Benteke and Agbonlahor are. Last season he was only bettered by Guzan and Benteke IMO. I mean look at [this](http://164.177.157.12/img/graphics/373.jpg) for how important he was. Yes he's been poor this year. But, remember, after Albrighton's amazing breakthrough in 2010/11 he was largely disappointing until this season when he's been great. I'm sure Weimann can bounce back and be a great asset again.

What position, team, and formation suit him best at Villa?

It's hard to judge his best position. He's not the CAM we need. He does however play best in part of a front 3 alongside Benteke and Agbonlahor. Either on the left wing or up top with Benteke seems to produce he's most influential performances.

Should he remain at Villa?

Yes. I'd be gutted if he left. One good season and one poor season under his belt. He's forced himself into Lambert's preferred 11. He' still only 22. He potentially has a very bright future and hopefully it'll be at Villa.

What, in your opinion, are his main strengths and weaknesses?

He's a workhorse. Without a doubt our hardest working forward. He also never gives up on a loose ball, something that has benefited us many times over the last 2 seasons. And pace of course, probably only behind Gabby as our quickest player. Weaknesses for me are finishing and disappearing from games. If he is going to be in the starting 11 he really needs to improve his finishing. He doesn't score enough for an attacker and that's mainly down to poor finishing, he certainly has the ability to get in the positions. Also, when he's not in form, you often forget he's on the pitch. He needs to have more consistent impact on games. Even when Gabby is off-form he still gets involved. Weimann needs to do that.

Do you think he has the ability to become a quality premier league forward?

Yes. He's 22. After last season he was linked with Liverpool. He certainly has the potential.

Edit: Seems like I'm the only supporter of him at the moment. Interesting.",0,1398298047,null,0,false,0,ch0dmyq,t3_23rlwq,t1_ch0dmyq,t3_23rlwq,null,1433492351,8,false,avfc,t5_2s569,8

It would leave me to believe you approached the topic with a preformed conclusion. That your Unionism is not based on rational judgement but rather formed by an emotional and cultural response explicit or subconscious and what little facts you do know have been molded to suit your preexisting bias.

Who are these people from the Republic you have spoken with, do you have a link to their economic research the papers they have published on this topic? If they haven't got scientific research to back up their claims it's meaningless to me. I'm not interested in pointless hearsay.

The constitutional issue is inextricably linked to the Economic one. To ignore that ignores the reality of our current economic system and undermines Northern Ireland's potential. At the moment economic policy for the United Kingdom is set firstly to benefit the City of London and secondly the Greater London Area to the detriment of everywhere outside of Southern England. This is the future NI21 wants for Northern Ireland it's depressing. A Northern Ireland living on handouts from London. A Northern Ireland tied to London and the country with the worst social mobility in the OECD. A Northern Ireland dragged further away from Europe by the anti European Union policies of the United Kingdom.

If NI21 was to achieve its goal and Northern Ireland got control of Taxation. It is my understanding, we would lose the income we get from the United Kingdom anyway. So your main reason for staying in the United Kingdom would be lost if you achieved your main economic policy. NI21 needs to clarify this.

Finally no Economics isn't simple, life isn't simple, the world isn't simple either. It is in fact complex. I except the people running a country to be able to deal with complex. If your party has based its Unionist stance on economics you must have a system to evaluate the economic value of the Union. The fact that this is the core difference between you and other Unionist parties would make one assume someone in the party would have undertaken a report or commissioned an independent report from people from outside the country from which your economic position could be derived and then justified. 

If you simply feel Northern Ireland would do better in the Union which no economic data to back you up your politics are just the same as every other Unionist party. If your party stands for a new kind of politics in Northern Ireland then this economic data should be made clear. I would expect a list of criteria A. B. C. D. and E. outlining your economic case for Unionism and clear outline of the needed change before you would support integration into the Republics economy.

true,harberton,null,null,"&gt; Alright, figured it out! I was assured by a USPS employee that a proper amount of US stamps on a piece of mail will still get send from the UK to the US as long as it's enough stamps.

This isn't true. Royal Mail will return it to the sender in the UK. If there's no address on the outside envelope this involves sending it to Belfast where somebody opens it and if there's an address there it goes to them. Failing that it'll be destroyed.

It is extremely unlikely they'll send an item onwards and expect USPS or any other foreign postal service to collect the unpaid postage, because chances are it wouldn't happen and the admin involved is too much.

Go on ebay and there's almost definitely UK stamps available in the US that can be bought individually, probably with very little mark up. Either buy one that covers the whole amount or buy a few 1st or 2nd class stamps to cover the amount. 1st class is currently worth 62p and 2nd is worth 53p. Or see if there's a stamp dealer near you. 

For example these are in California and could be used.

true,JohnShit,eng-wiltshire,Wiltshire,"Of course I read the article. You aren't considering how this would be likely to play out in reality if the CPS habitually prosecuted people who voluntarily withdrew accusations.  

As it stands, a person who makes a false accusation can voluntarily withdraw the accusation and sometimes walk away without punishment. Though I don't doubt that it's a deeply unpleasant experience for the person accused, they are not punished by the law.

If the accuser knew that they would stand to be prosecuted for withdrawing the accusation, it is highly likely that they simply would not withdraw it. Unless the accusation could be proved to be false beyond reasonable doubt (which it usually can't), they would still walk away unpunished.

By adopting a policy of prosecuting people who voluntarily withdraw accusations, it's highly unlikely that the CPS would achieve much aside from making the suffering of people who are falsely accused far, far worse.

Having barriers that force the cyclist to dismount and lift up their bike every few hundred metres is like having stop signs every mile on a motorway where you have to turn your engine off and get out and push. It just wasn't designed by somebody who uses them at all.

Also, a lot of the major national cycle routes are just gravel paths or muddy trails that just aren't fit for purpose. Firstly you can't pick up much speed on gravel or mud due to the lack of traction, especially if it's wet. Secondly, there is an increased risk of punctures.

more and more attention; broadcasters always go on about QBR, YPC, YPA, shit, I think last year for the first time, I even saw Yards/point and I thought to myself, what a useless stat lol. Fantasy football plays a big role in the growth of statics in the NFL.

104th minute due to Suarez's antics

Liverpool Corner

Cech punts it out to Torres, who even with his slowing pace is 1 on 1 with Brad Jones after Mignolet punches on with Schurrle.

He collects the ball at his feet with the grace of 2009, his eyes poised for destruction. With one mighty kick that'd make the gods cry he punts the ball back towards the Chelsea goal, the shot bursting the back of the net. Terry's dick explodes, Cech looks on in disbelief.

Torres pulls up his shirt to the kop to reveal a tattoo of Alonso, Gerrard and Masch. ""I did it for you"" he whispers, as he pulls a Samurai sword from his arse and commits Seppuku infront of the Kop.

**Alonso:** Absolutely, absolutely. Whenever I’m not on work duty, I keep an eye on the Reds. I’m really excited. It’s thrilling what’s happening in the city right now.

Is he good enough for Villa? To oversimplify - in a bad season for him and a bad season for the team I think he was still one of our top 11 players. And because he is still a young guy - and an admirable kind of player - I would be disappointed if we let him leave.

He doesn't score many goals for a forward though, which is a problem. There doesn't seem to be much getting around this.

I have a theory - I may be quite mad as I've never heard anyone else say anything similar - that he would make a very decent central midfielder. He has the legs to do the running, can chip in with the occasional goal (which has been lacking from our mids as well as our strikers this year) the ability to assist; and with experience will gain more and more composure and the ability to dictate the game. Himself and Delph in the centre (with a DM player behind them) charging forward would actually be quite exciting as an idea. And they're both just kids still! Stick Albrighton on the wing or even as 10, and see how we go.

Again, I am likely mad. And if/when Benteke leaves and we convert Weimann we're going to need another striker sharpish.

This meant that incomes for the year that the 50p tax rate was in effect were reported to be lower (To the tune of 16-18 billion [according the HMRC](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/budget2012/excheq-income-tax-2042.pdf)) and thus the tax revenue was also lower than you might expect. Before reported income levels were back to normal, the tax rate was cut to 45% again. This isn't a case of people being fine with the 45% rate, it's a case of people moving their income to the 45% rate instead of the 50% rate because, who wouldn't? It changes when the option is 50% or 50%, you can't avoid it like that anymore.

&gt; Once you go past a certain point, people will look into tax avoidance.

People do that regardless. From ISA savings accounts all the way to owning your own shell company in a tax haven, people will do anything economically viable to minimise their tax expenses. An extra 5% marginal rate on earnings over £150k is barely going to force people out of the country, or start avoiding tax where they would not have done before (Unless of course, there is a clear transition that they can exploit - like announcing a year in advance that the tax rate is going to go up so that people can prepare for it).
