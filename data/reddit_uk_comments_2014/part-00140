Plus, would a qualifier in July be so bad?  We have a lot of really good players not going to the World Cup, so we could field a hell of a team that would have been training together for more than a month(assuming they get about a month off after the end of the season):

                        Friedel*

        Naughton* - Dawson - Chiriches - Rose*

                    Sandro - Holtby

              Lamela - Eriksen - Townsend

                         Soldado

&gt;Now if a parent may own his child (within the framework of non-aggression and runaway-freedom), then he may also transfer that ownership to someone else. He may give the child out for adoption, or he may sell the rights to the child in a voluntary contract. In short, we must face the fact that the purely free society will have a flourishing free market in children. Superficially, this sounds monstrous and inhuman. But closer thought will reveal the superior humanism of such a market. For we must realize that there is a market for children now, but that since the government prohibits sale of children at a price, the parents may now only give their children away to a licensed adoption agency free of charge.[12] This means that we now indeed have a child-market, but that the government enforces a maximum price control of zero, and restricts the market to a few privileged and therefore monopolistic agencies. The result has been a typical market where the price of the commodity is held by government far below the free-market price: an enormous “shortage” of the good. The demand for babies and children is usually far greater than the supply, and hence we see daily tragedies of adults denied the joys of adopting children by prying and tyrannical adoption agencies. In fact, we find a large unsatisfied demand by adults and couples for children, along with a large number of surplus and unwanted babies neglected or maltreated by their parents. Allowing a free market in children would eliminate this imbalance, and would allow for an allocation of babies and children away from parents who dislike or do not care for their children, and toward foster parents who deeply desire such children. Everyone involved: the natural parents, the children, and the foster parents purchasing the children, would be better off in this sort of society.[13]

Further more ""the word in some cases could be used without **deliberate insult**"" this suggests to me that even when it was meant as a non offensive term it still had the power to offend due to historical and social context.


You argue that words only have the power that we give them and you are entirely correct.

If Raheem isn't tracking back, then Johnson isn't solely responsible for errors there, especially if his role in the system is to overlap whoever is playing on the right wing/right of the diamond. Our full backs, Johnson in particular, are often our furthest forward players and are our only source of width when playing with the diamond.

This is a fair criticism. Johnson's defending for crosses was *terrible* last year. I've bemoaned his inability to defend crosses and high balls from our left that come to his side plenty. But he's been better this year.

He *can* defend, it's just the system and role he is playing is not conducive to him defending break away attacks from the opposition.

Johnson hasn't been brilliant this year, but he's not been as bad as people are making out. He is not the sole player responsible for losses or conceding goals.

What I'm saying is that you're a little confused about is the direction of causation; your claim that the fact there are both a lot of jobs and immigrants in London proves that immigrants create jobs is far FAR more easily explained by assuming immigrants simply go where the jobs are, and nobody seriously disputes this explains a large part of the behaviour of immegrating families.

&gt; The guy killed someone because he was driving recklessly and way over the speed limit. If he'd been doing neither the other person would still be alive.

Nobody is disputing any of these facts.

If you want to go on a moral crusade and get emotional about this, then you are guaranteed to push for an unfair punishment. Unless you can tell me you have never broken a rule, and never made a mistake in you entire life then you have no right to damn this man to a life of imprisonment and brand him ""murderer"". The man is an idiot, but he is not a cold blooded killer.

edit:"" If he'd been doing neither the other person would still be alive."" is a poor argument, you're trying to provoke an emotional response to justify a change in the definition of the word ""intention"".

I'm not saying he needs to be tarred and feathered or branded for life. My point is that his actions resulted in the death of one person and serious injury to 4 others. At the last he should serve a reasonable amount of time for the death and be banned for life from driving.

Which means he isnt good for our system, as per your statement. So....what good is he? One of the top earners cant be a benchwarmer. He needs to go. 

&gt; If Raheem isn't tracking back, then Johnson isn't solely responsible for errors there,.... similarly

As a Right Back Defender, his first job is to show attackers on their weaker side or away from goal. He doesnt. His second job if the first method doesnt work is to tackle. He doesnt. His third job is then by hook or crook try to recover the ball (professional fouls / PKs conceded). He doesnt. What does he do then? Let players slip past. 

&gt;  But he's been better this year.
He can defend, it's just the system and role he is playing is not conducive to him defending break away attacks from the opposition.

He has not. If you run a simple Google search and dig out articles, there are his errors and lapses in concentration that have been talked about time and time again. He may be a good attacker. But his first job is to make sure the bag of wind doesnt enter the net. 

&gt; Johnson hasn't been brilliant this year, but he's not been as bad as people are making out. He is not the sole player responsible for losses or conceding goals. He's about as culpable as the rest of the back four. Criticise him for that, but don't make out that he's the worst player to lace up a pair of boots for Liverpool and a donkey could defend better than him.

This would imply that men and women are actually different races, and that sexism is a type of racism. It would also suggest, for example, that individuals with Down's syndrome are of a different race to everyone else. This seems to be very much at odds with the commonly-accepted idea of race.

Another unusual category is linguistics. Are we to consider Geordies, for example, as being a different race to the Cornish? What about languages that are used by geographically and culturally distinct people, such as Welsh - there are now more Welsh speakers in Argentina than Wales.

We aren't talking about that, we are talking about it not being his intent to murder

&gt; You, like others, seem to be treating this all like it was an unavoidable accident. Read the article, he was doing 130 down an A road and over taking multiple cars at a time and bombing around the bends in the road. Eventually skidding and crashing into another car. Does any of what happened as a result of his driving surprise you?

It was clearly avoidable, but it happened anyway, that doesn't mean we should treat it like he meant for this end result to happen, would you accept full responsibility and intent if you made a genuine mistake while breaking a few rules? I don't think so, you would be saying ""but I didn't mean it"". It's clear that he wanted to drive fast, that is the only obvious intent that I can see here, the rest is unfortunate but it clearly did not factor into his decision making at all, so unless you wish to change the dictionary definition of ""intention"" then your moral crusade is pointless.

&gt; I'm not saying he needs to be tarred and feathered or branded for life. My point is that his actions resulted in the death of one person and serious injury to 4 others. At the last he should serve a reasonable amount of time for the death and be banned for life from driving.

Nobody is arguing about the severity of the punishment, that is for the courts to decide. What everyone is arguing about, is that you and a few others have taken it upon yourself to twist the definition of ""intention"" to suit your moral crusade. 

It's like someone running quickly down the street and accidentally bumps into you and knocks you over, you're not going to accuse them of purposely aiming for you in an attempt to knock you over, because it's clearly not their intention (unless they have mental problems). You would call them an idiot for running down a busy street (which is the intention) and not looking where they are going, because carelessness and poor decision making can lead to accidents, like the driver who was intending to go fast and accidentally killed someone.

I don't understand why you're accusing me of being an apologist just because I won't join your moral crusade, I would rather look at the facts and have it dealt with fairly, not lash out emotionally and demand that he be treated as a murderer when that clearly wasn't his goal.

true,shotglass21,eng-GreaterLondon,London AKA civilisation,"&gt; Africa was a savage land of war before any europeans came, It had problems with disease and small populations, European countries came on brought irrigation, industry, medicine.

I find it shocking that people still believe these sorts of misconceptions in this day and age, to try and glorify the empire. The idea that Africans were a bunch of wild savages with no form and civilisation and culture, until the glorious white Europeans came along and gifted them with modern advancements, plays right into the racist colonial mindset. The European colonists suppressed the native population and prevented them from advancing as nation due to all its resources being drained and the wealth supplied back to the UK.

Personally, I think that's a reasonable way of thinking. Judging from the history of humanity, it does seem as if sex and race have similar problems. Conversely, I don't think you should be using this sort of logic to definitions of terms. The sex chromosome is a constant in all races; we all have (at least) one, and it holds it's own race specific differences.

&gt; It would also suggest, for example, that individuals with Down's syndrome are of a different race to everyone else.

Like with sex, this is a matter of chromosome level differences. They still carry the same information, just an extra copy.

&gt; Another unusual category is linguistics. Are we to consider Geordies, for example, as being a different race to the Cornish? What about languages that are used by geographically and culturally distinct people, such as Welsh - there are now more Welsh speakers in Argentina than Wales.

I'm not even sure what the linguistic part means myself, but I guess you could say that people have and still do discriminate based on language and linguistic differences.

&gt; Sorry, but I don't really trust this as a reasonable definition of race.

I do, since it means we have a term that accurately describes disliking people on a nationality basis.

It depends on the circumstances, did he see the mother and child and think ""I am going to murder them"" or did he not see them and accidentally hit them?

* The definition of *racism* as including culture and nationality etc is a very limited academic usage, only really making sense studies such as cultural anthropology. (In fact the only accepted form of this in everyday language seems to be when referring to Jews.)

true,ShanghaiNoon,null,null,"&gt;I think you're a little confused here; your claim seems to be that if it weren't for immigration unemployment would have risen because the number of jobs would have remained static but the population would have risen. I don't understand on what basis you're saying that; you seem to be saying that you know immigration creates jobs because otherwise no new jobs would be created, which is circular. I'm saying it is highly likely immigration creates jobs (although I know the academic literature is currently without consensus on the issue) but that the reason you see immegration to London is because there are jobs there (along with a couple of other reasons that aren't at issue here).

It's not a complicated subject, if x number of people live in an area and y number of people migrate to the area, zero job creation would mean the number of unemployed/economically inactive people in that area rises by y. 

Also, it's not an academically controversial matter that immigration creates jobs, it boosts aggregate demand in the economy which spurs job growth. This is basic economics.

&gt;What I'm saying is that you're a little confused about is the direction of causation; your claim that the fact there are both a lot of jobs and immigrants in London proves that immigrants create jobs is far FAR more easily explained by assuming immigrants simply go where the jobs are, and nobody seriously disputes this explains a large part of the behaviour of immegrating families. Whether immigrants actually create those jobs or simply 'piggyback' off general UK economic growth is tricky to say, and certainly not possible to say simply from comparing rates of immegration and employment.

This paragraph doesn't really make sense. Unless you're completely rejecting the fundamentals of economics: that an increase in demand doesn't create jobs, then this paragraph is redundant.

**GK (2, including 2 HG)**

* Hart (HG)
* Wright (HG)
* **Note:** I can't rationalize using a spot on Pants as a non-HG backup. 

**Defense (8, including 1 HG, 2 CG):**

* Clichy (HG)
* Kolarov
* Zaba
* New CB signing
* Sagna
* Kompany
* Richards (CG)
* Boyata (CG)
* **Note:** Originally had Micah leaving but we really need to keep him. Adding Sagna would be redundant but I don't think Pellegrini would sign him and then leave him off. Kolarov could be used more as a winger.


**Midfield (7, including 1 HG, 2 CG):**

* Nasri
* Silva
* Milner (HG)
* Toure
* Fernandinho
* Huws (CG)
* Lopes (CG)
* **Note:** Here's really where it comes back to bite us. I had to drop Navas and Garcia (and Rodwell, if he stays) because they are the least crucial and least versatile non-HG players I can think of. Jovetic/Kolarov can be used as wingers, if need be. Huws/Lopes are eligible for B-list but I'm using them as placeholders.

**Striker (4):**

* Aguero
* Dzeko
* Negredo
* Jovetic
* **Note:** Can't see any of the four behind left off, especially with Aguero's injury history. ",0,1400334024,null,0,false,0,chka4ug,t3_25s4q0,t1_chka4ug,t3_25s4q0,null,1433836410,6,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,6

What you're saying is that:

\- if it weren't for Europeans, Africans would still be the savages that they were and that therefore colonisation was OK in hindsight. 

\- the fact that imperialist rule was acceptable at the time means that it is not regrettable now. 

Here's why that's a load of bullshit. 

&amp;nbsp;

###Rich countries continue to benefit from the exploitation of poor countries. 

Colonialism involved force because it wasn't mutually beneficial. This should go without saying. The former colonies didn't welcome their conquerors because, believe it or not, sovereign nations prefer not to be invaded and all that that entails.

Once established, patterns of international trade and relations become entrenched. Developing countries lose more than they gain from foreign aid. 

&gt; [Developing countries receive about $136 billion in aid from donor countries each year. At the same time, however, they lose about $1 trillion each year through offshore capital flight, mostly in the form of tax avoidance by multinational corporations. That’s nearly 10 times the size of the aid budget.](http://www.newleftproject.org/index.php/site/article_comments/aid_in_reverse_how_poor_countries_develop_rich_countries)

The way that poor countries develop is not through charity, but through trade. 

&gt;[As it happens the only thing we know of that makes people richer is economic development. Trade. This is how Japan and South Korea did it, this is how China is doing it and we are beginning to see the effects in sub-Saharan Africa as well.](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/timworstall/100017273/trade-not-aid-is-what-improves-life-in-the-third-world/)

The current structure of world trade is what is keeping poor countries poor. This has in fact, been recognised by rich countries themselves following the Doha round of negotiations under the WTO. 

&gt;[There are both net winners and net losers under different scenarios, and the poorest countries are among the net losers under all likely Doha scenarios.](http://carnegieendowment.org/files/Winners.Losers.final2.pdf)

The IMF and the World Bank, which operate according to [the Washington Consensus](http://www.iie.com/publications/papers/williamson0204.pdf) have for the past 20-odd years been doing their utmost to privatise public institutions and liberalise trade and financial markets. 

What this has meant in practice is that (i) the state - the best means by which poor countries can become rich - has been broken up into separate parts and sold on to rich foreign investors and (ii) that poor countries have been forced to compete with rich countries regardless of their ability or readiness to do so. 

The countries that have successfully escaped poverty - South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and China - have all had strong states which have protected their own industries against unfair competition and exploitation by multinational corporations (MNCs). 

These countries did not grow rich through the benevolence of Western imperialist powers. Rich countries are not in the business of making poor countries rich, that is the last thing they would want to do. If European countries cared about African countries developing, they would abolish the Common Agricultural Policy which keeps African exporters poor. 

&amp;nbsp;

###The wealth of the richest countries in the world was built upon slavery

The wealth of the former imperialist powers was built on the slave labour of their colonies. This was the very point of colonisation: to take other people's lands and use their people in order to become rich. 

&gt;[The commercial capitalism of the eighteenth century developed
the wealth of Europe by means of slavery and monopoly. But in
so doing it helped to create the industrial capitalism of the nineteenth
century, which turned round and destroyed the power
of commercial capitalism, slavery, and all its works. Without a
grasp of these economic changes the history of the period is
meaningless.](https://ia600508.us.archive.org/7/items/capitalismandsla033027mbp/capitalismandsla033027mbp.pdf) ([Williams,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Williams) 1943: 210)

--

&gt;[The Dutch, British, and French introduced plantation
agriculture in Caribbean islands they seized from Spain in
the seventeenth century. The indigenous populations had
been virtually exterminated before they arrived, 3.8 million
slaves were imported in the colonial period, and
production became highly specialized.](http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/other_books/Growth_and_Interaction_in_the_World_Economy.pdf) (Maddison, 2005: 35)

The wealth of the West is built on unspeakable crimes that have been forgotten because it is easier to believe the more convenient myths of salvation by the nice white folk of the West who brought God, laws and machinery. 

&amp;nbsp;

###Colonialisation and neo-imperialism is the reason for the differences between rich and poor countries that persist to this day

Western capitalists have historically put so much effort into seizing Africa's natural resources, so that *they* would benefit from the continent's natural resources rather than the Africans themselves. This was the point of colonisation, and it is the point of structural adjustment policies. 

Historically, [up until about three centuries ago, there wasn't any clear difference in wealth between countries.](http://www.relooney.fatcow.com/00_New_2733.pdf) Colonialisation is why poor countries became poor and its legacy is why they stay poor - and [why WTO meetings have been protested the way they have been.](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/the-dark-side-of-globalization-why-seattles-1999-protesters-were-right/282831/)

I wouldn't claim that Northern Ireland was 'populated by' religious fanatics. The Protestant/Catholic thing that goes on there isn't necessarily a religious distinction so much as an ethnic one. People can identify as one or the other without necessarily being religious.

true,inheritedthrowaway,null,null,"Hey, similar position to you - I'm a first year Uni student and inherited ~£500k cash this year, though my income is well below yours. This is my opinion from dealing my own issues and is not advice. I'm risk averse and am doing a vocational degree with high starting salaries, so shouldn't need to touch the money until I want to buy a house.

**Student Loan**

This is not economical. You have the capital now and a stable sounding portfolio of income generating investments.

As pointed out elsewhere, you are currently - while studying - accruing 6.3% interest on your loan. Paying it immediately saves ~£3500 after a four year degree. For the following 30 years you'll then have an additional 9% ""tax"" on your earnings over £21k. On your current £25k - £35k income, that's an additional £350-£1260 a year (The interest is ~£2400, so the ""tax"" will stick around for the following 30 years unless you more than double your earnings).

Do you see yourself needing £40k of additional capital at the end of your degree?

**Cash + Funds**
 
I don't like bonds. They seem expensive and the interest rates are not at an acceptable premium over savings accounts to make it worthwhile to me. I use a mixture of cash in savings accounts and passive index funds.

Cash is minimal risk and most liquid. I like cash because if something comes up there's no risk of not being able to sell my assets. Passive index funds are normally good for about 5+ yrs. Definitely good for 10+ yrs. Diversify into multiple indices - high cap, mid cap, all share, international. Remember to watch the fees and yields. You want the fees to be as low as possible and the yields to match the yield of the index tracked. As a benchmark, HSBC do trackers for 0.27% pa.

**Property**

Property sounds good and I'm considering areas where yields are high (Southampton, Birmingham...) for my own portfolio. Fairly stable but incredibly illiquid. You have wealth tied up in individual stocks, property and bonds - all illiquid assets. I like to keep some cash, even if it's in a 0.5-1% instant access savings account, because I can get hold of it when I need it.

Since I lived overseas we almost never got Dutch Eredivisie Football on TV. But the EPL was on every weekend. My dad and my older brother started watching every week. So I started watching EPL around 2003/2004. Then the year after (04/05 season) I really started watching EPL/Champions League games on a regular basis with my best friend. But neither of us really had a favorite team. I really liked Arsenal (and still do) because of Henry/Bergkamp &amp; the Untouchables season, and because my brother and my dad were Arsenal fans. I like Arsenal so much that I know if I wasn't a Liverpool fan I would be an Arsenal fan. Because seriously who's gonna be a Man U/City or Chelsea fan. No Thank You. 

 I started to seriously watch football that season. I loved Gerrard, watching him play and just the type of person he is made me like Liverpool. When he scored that screamer against Olympiakos I went crazy. Then when we won the Champions League the way we did I just fucking lost it. I pretty much devoted myself to Liverpool fully that day. Loved Gerrard from that moment on. Then the year after the 2006 FA Cup final happened. So yea I fucking love Liverpool .

I have also been a big fan of Kuyt. One of my favorite players. He is probably one of the hardest working footballers ever. His determination and stamina is insane. He also seems like a nice guy.

Most of my extended family that still lives in The Netherlands are Feyenoord fans. One day back in late 2004 I went to my very first big football match (50+K people). We watched Feyenoord play in De Kuip in Rotterdam when Kuyt was their main striker. Feyenoord won 6-1 against Willem II. Kuyt with a hat-trick and Kalou with 2 goals.

You could maybe argue that they should have had a defender on the back post as well.

St Johnstone have been solid and dealt with most of what Dundee Utd threw at them, but could easily have gone down 1-0. Easton has been a good outlet down the left for them, and Wotherspoon has been very tidy in midfield. May has done nothing besides a couple of wild long shots, but he might find himself with some more space in the second half as Dundee Utd chase a goal. If he can get running at Dillon he might have some joy.

I wonder if we'll see Gauld early in the second half. I felt Armstrong wasn't great that half, but did improve as it went on. He'll need to get closer to Ciftci in the second half.

Opening up a bank account in the UK for an American 
citizen can be a pain, but it is doable. First, here are 
some things you will need:

Your passport.
Proof of your UK address – a credit card statement with your UK address will NOT suffice! Proof of address means a utility bill or a certified letter from your employer or school saying you do indeed live in the UK.

Once you have these you are ready to open your checking account. Please note that checking accounts are called current accounts in the UK.

Types of Current Accounts

Regular account. If you are not a UK citizen and have less than £2000 ($4000US) in your account at all times your bank will charge you a £5 ($10) monthly fee for a normal current account. If you go this route, you will be given a debit ATM card with a Visa or MasterCard logo that can be used wherever credit cards can be used. You also use this card to withdraw cash at ATMs, or as they are commonly referred to in the UK, cash machines. A regular current account will also give you access to online banking. 

Cash Card account. Those who won’t have £2000 in their account monthly or don’t want to pay a monthly £5 fee can apply for a cash card. This is simply an ATM card so you can make deposits and withdrawals at ATMs. You cannot use this as a debit card and you have no online account access. It’s strictly to get cash from ATMs.

true,TopdeBotton,null,null,"Naturally, whatever I do today is a direct result of historical progress. That's true in any case, because this line of reasoning is  a kind of historical tautology. 

Everything that exists today exists because this is the way that history turned out. The logic goes as follows: the past built the present, therefore we should accept the past, regardless of how it may otherwise have turned out. 

That would have been as true in the early 20th century during colonial times as it is today and will remain as true in a hundred years' time, whatever happens over the coming century. That's why it's irrelevant. 

If the Allies had lost WWII and Britain was under fascist rule, whatever future Britain had would have been the result of its fascist history by this logic. Fascism would have been responsible for technological progress, whatever that progress turned out to be, and it would have been legitimated by the very breathing of these hypothetical Brits because they would have had to accept however history turned out as fine. 

Whatever system of international relations or international trade that we have builds the future world that we inhabit. There's nothing deterministic about it and history doesn't justify itself. 

As it happens, the rich countries appear to be in a kind of long term malaise, or a so-called Secular Stagnation. China is gradually becoming the hegemonic power (or at the very least a global superpower) and Pakistan and India have nuclear weapons. 

There are a lot of people worried about these trends and they have good reason to be - in large part due to the legacy of the British empire. Rich countries stay rich through force and that force comes from economic power. The economic power of the West is dwindling because it's reached a point where free trade isn't going to make it any more of an industrial power. 

This is why we've had financialisation - the growth of credit, asset bubbles and the ubiquity of privatisation - which in turn has made financial crises more frequent and severe. When you can't grow through mainly physical production like Britain did up until the 1970s or so, you have to grow through other (financial) means. This leads to a different kind of crisis though. 

We don't have it figured out in the UK; we're not better than African countries. We're not especially ""modern"" or superior in any general way. History has hitherto served us well but it's no guarantee of future stability. The blind nationalism in this thread is really quite disturbing.

&gt;Usage

&gt;In recent years, the associations of race with the ideologies and theories that grew out of the work of 19th-century anthropologists and physiologists has led to the use of the word race itself becoming problematic.

If we were to use the party-list PR system similar to the European parliament, then I could imagine the following:

* The country would be partitioned according to a bunch of electoral regions (scaled so that each region would cover 10 constituencies in the current system).
* Parties would field candidates for each region
* During an election, the electorate vote for a party they would like
* Each party is then allocated seats for the region according to the electorate vote for the region (if there are 10 seats for one region, then if 40% of the electorate vote labour, then labour gets 4 seats etc.)
* Where there are borderline cases (such as a party winning half a seat), there would be appropriate adjustments, but done in a proportional manner so as not to give an unfair advantage (lots of options here, for example, flexible seat numbers but adjusting the seat allocation appropriate (ala the German system), or rounding down on the seats then using some ordering to allocate any leftover seats)

----------------------------

&gt; Do I pay 30 quid and not pay anything else everytime I travel? 

No, you pay the £30 and get 34% off rail fares with certain exceptions (see below)

* There is a £12 minimum fare before 10am *except*
 1. Weekends
 2. Public Holidays
 3. In July and August

thus if you plan to travel to and from uni a season ticket is likely better value. 

* You can use it get discounted tickets except for walk-up First Class fares (First Advances are permitted)

* A 16-25 railcard is also covered under Virgin's railcard easement allowing Railcard users to use off-peak tickets in the peak period as long as the journey is wholly on Virgin. Probably not all that useful for you in Sheffield but may be worth considering going via Manchester if you must leave London at a given time.

&gt; And where does the rail takes me to? Does it travel all over UK?

Anywhere your ticket is valid. It is valid in Great Britain but I am not sure about NI. 

* The railcard gives 1/3 off for £30 so it'll pay for itself if you pay more than £60 for travel with it. If you think you'll manage this go for it (or if you get the card for free)

* If you have an Oyster card you can get your railcard loaded onto it for discounted trips in London.",0,1400343311,null,0,1400348608,0,chkczow,t3_25squx,t1_chkczow,t3_25squx,null,1433837820,15,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,15

And it was all repaid with interest in 2012, and a nice little ""thank you"" to the Government in the form of 1.5 billion. Meaning it didn't ""cost"" the taxpayers a penny, in fact quite the opposite, it added around 1.5 billion to the coffers for basically a ZERO risk deal.

The Race Relations Act 1976 specifies nationality anyway, so it's a moot point!

Section 1:

&gt;A person discriminates against another if... he applies to that other a provision, criterion or practice which he applies or would apply equally to persons not of the same race or ethnic or national origins as that other, but which puts or would put persons of the same race or ethnic or national origins as that other at a particular disadvantage when compared with other persons,""

Section 3 also specifically states:

&gt;In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires racial grounds means any of the following grounds, namely colour, race, nationality or ethnic or national origins;

Also, Section 19 C and 19 D specifically states that immigration is exempt.

&gt;Section 19B does not apply to any act of, or relating to, imposing a requirement, or giving an express authorisation, of a kind mentioned in section 19D(3) in relation to the carrying out of immigration functions. 

&gt;Section 19B does not make it unlawful for a relevant person to discriminate against another person on grounds of nationality or ethnic or national origins in carrying out immigration functions.

I'm given to understand that it's not even about the funding.  The main correlation with academic performance is with things like your family stability and your health.  These correlations far outweigh any difference made by the type of school you attend.

This makes sense because if you come from a reasonably well-to-do family, that cares for you properly and supports you in your endeavours, then you're obviously going to be at an advantage compared to those who don't.

The correlation between private education and academic performance is mostly explained by the fact that most of the kids who are sent there have that supportive, stable home life.

[Sir Francis Drake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Drake), for defeating the Spanish Armada (despite the fact that even a brief glance at his Wiki page as an adult reveals that he wasn't in charge of that fleet, and as a slave trading privateer he seems a dubious hero)

Explorers like [Walter Raleigh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Raleigh), [Captain Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook), [Dr Livingstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Livingstone) and [Captain Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Falcon_Scott) (with Lawrence ""I am just going outside and may be some time"" [Oates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Oates)).

The [Suffragettes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffragette).

In the arts, I could maybe add [Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._W._Turner), and poets like [Wordsworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wordsworth), [Byron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron), [Shelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley), [Tennyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennyson), [Owen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfred_Owen), [Sassoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegfried_Sassoon), [Betjeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Betjeman) to the already mentioned.

You're talking about the meaning of a legal term as defined by law, and the meaning of a word as defined by every dictionary.  That's pretty objective.

In this debate, you are sourcing your ideas solely from your head, whereas everyone else is sourcing from something outside of themselves and their own prejudices/desire to win the argument.  That makes it inherently more objective because there is recourse is to some authority outside of the debaters.  If you don't understand why this is, then you don't understand what objectivity is.

The feeling you are feeling that it's all so unfair that all the evidence is against you and the law and the dictionaries must all be wrong, is what it feels like to lose an argument, nothing more.  I imagine if the situation were reversed and all the laws and dictionaries confirmed solely your definition, you'd think they were more important - you were the one who brought up the 1976 Race Relations Act after all.  That's why objective debaters respect authoratitive evidence whether it agrees with them or not - if you reject only the evidence which disagrees with your position, you are not being objective.  

Just to remind you though, you were the one who started a semantic argument, resting solely on the meaning of words, specifically resting on the assumption that the term race can be defined solely in terms of one of its determiners (physical characteristics) and never on any of the others.  Your definition is there, but then so are many others.  Here's the Cambridge Dictionary in addition to the Oxford Dictionary:

race:
[C, + sing/pl verb] a group of people who share the same language, history, characteristics, etc.:
The British are an island race.

And Webster:

a class or kind of people unified by shared interests, habits, or characteristics

http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/race
http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/race_2

You are trying to prove a universal negative in a semantic argument, and are disputing both its original meaning and one of its common modern uses!  You have set yourself an impossible task and are doomed to fail.

The EU, has just 28 people who have the right to propose legislation. And this represents 500 MILLION people.

The EU is significantly more anti-democratic than westminister because of the sheer concentration of power. Not to mention, you say

You are aware that some of these have never appeared on ANY PUBLIC BALLOT EVER? Catherine Ashton has never once been voted into ANYTHING. Yet she sits on a commission of 28 people who are the only people in Europe with the right to propose EU legislation.

You can't say that just because someone is appointed by member states, that that is democracy.

Would it be democratic if David Cameron said ""well, I've been elected as an MP, so I'm now going to appoint this random bloke off the street who has never been on a public ballot to an extremely powerful position""?

I think it is perfectly fair to say that people who are ""appointed"" are NOT elected. I mean, what is your logic here? That just because the commission is appointed by people who HAVE been elected ,that that is completely fine? That's such bullshit.

The EU IS anti-democratic. 28 appointed people having the SOLE right to propose legislation that represents 500 MILLION people is not democratic. 

It just isn't. The UK, with its 650 MPs and house of lords, who all have the right to propose legislation, is JUST about democratic. Just about. And even then, we need to improve the democratic representation in this country.

The EU is an order of magnitude less democratic than that.",1,1400345708,null,0,false,0,chkdw97,t3_25s5w2,t1_chkdw97,t1_chk9e56,null,1433838246,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

true,Froolow,null,null,"I think we're both in agreement that if x people live in an area and y new people arrive, zero job creation would mean unemployment would be some function of y. I also think neither of us disagree that jobs must have been created in London for the figures we see to be the case.

But you made a stronger claim than that; you said 'If x people live in an area and y new people tip up and unemployment remains unchanged, those y people much have created employment for themselves'. That is far stronger, because now you're making a causal claim.

Imagine the following scenario; x people live in an area and are highly economically productive, so that they are creating businesses which can support y additional jobs per year. Y additional people move to the area to take up the jobs. Unemployment remains unchanged, but the wave of immegration has nothing to do with creating the jobs, they just took up jobs which anyone in the country could have done. Given a choice between Xville (where there are lots of jobs) and Ztown (which is less economically productive) most of the immigrants from Ycountry will move to the more economically productive Xville, because despite what the *Mail* says I don't believe immigrants are desperate to throw themselves into the British welfare system. This will produce data that appears to support your conclusion (immegration increases employment because immigrants create jobs) but in fact the immigrants themselves aren't driving any growth because the economy of Xville was nowhere near capacity to begin with.

I understand that to an economist there might not be a difference between 'creating' a job out of nothing and filling a 'potentiated' job which is otherwise going unfilled, but that isn't a fair way out of your first comment; if immigrants are merely filling jobs rather than growing the economy then parties like UKIP can claim that states have a duty to protect their own citizens (or whatever) and therefore provide employment for Brits first. So in the head of the average UKIPper, a British company creates a new job opening and is just about to offer it to a Brit when an immigrant swoops in and offers to work for less. I doubt this is an accurate model of what actually occurs, but this is what they believe and is completely consistent with a static unemployment rate.

Another scenario is that the citizens of Xville are *really* productive, such that their unemployment is actually shrinking. But each Xville citizen who is successfully found employment is exactly counterbalanced by a Ycountry immigrant who refuses to work. In this example, Ycountry is *totally irrelevant* to the economic productivity of the country, but produces stable employment figures by accident. A belief in this model is extremely far-right, but is also consistent with the data you observe.

Unless you're only saying ""There must be enough jobs to go around because London still isn't at capacity"", which is more plausible, I think you have made a mistake between correlation and causation.",0,1400345735,null,0,false,0,chkdwmc,t3_25pdz0,t1_chkdwmc,t1_chka36t,null,1433838251,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I understand why you feel that way, but the danger with involving the public to too great an extent is that they are, largely, highly ignorant about what is and isn't possible, and about how bad the situation is right now.

&gt;but the public ought to be having this debate

That would require extensive education though, and there's a real problem in doing that. The public have no idea how fledging new types of renewable power are, they have no idea how long it takes to build a nuclear power plant, they have no idea about base load power, or about the fact that we've reduced our electricity generation capacity by about 40% in the last 10 years. They have no idea and they don't really seem to care, they just want to say their piece ""LETS FRACK"" or ""NO TO FRACKING LETS GET ALL RENEWABLES"" and feel good about it.

&gt;Ed Milliband saying, ""we should freeze all energy prices"" herp derp!

That's really more a consumer electricity issue than an electricity generation issue but obviously it would paralyse investment and is just one of the many reasons I can not see him being elected next year.

&gt;I really don't think that we should permit these clowns to just use fracking to avoid making the tough decisions

What would those tough decisions be? Also, why not? Expansion of the onshore gas industry would create tens of thousands of jobs, secure our energy, allow us to get off coal which is far dirtier, and enable us to see through the next 20-30 years secure in our electricity generation capabilities.",0,1400346651,null,0,false,0,chke96a,t3_25p13z,t1_chke96a,t1_chk6d5h,null,1433838416,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

That's me suggesting that you questioning the evidence which disagreed with you was perhaps a little less than objective, and was, perhaps, done because it disagreed with you and you didn't want to hear it.

But now I see that it was just a coincidence! You just though that recourse to the OED, the Cambridge Dictionary and Webster to determine the meaning of a word, or recourse to the law when determining legal definitions was genuinely and honestly an unobjective thing to do, and you would have said the same even if they'd confirmed everything you said.

I'm pleased you've changed your mind, but it's hard to see why given that you rejected all external evidence.

true,leviticusreeves,scot-Aberdeen,Aberdeenshire,"There's a third, larger category in addition to open and closet racists: people who are racist but don't realise it.

It's normal for people to be blind to their own prejudices, to make generalised assumptions based upon limited information (like attributing negative traits to whole groups of individuals based upon some set of beliefs about their nationality, ethnicity, religion etc.) It's also normal, even if hugely undesirable, to have some sort of innate concept of the 'other' - people who are different to 'us', outside 'our' group.

This means that people may just well be naturally inclined towards racism.

In the latter half of the 20th century, the western nations made huge efforts to understand what had caused the atrocities of WWII. This led to an attempt from within academia and certain quarters of the political classes to educate people against what the fascists had termed 'racism' (the similar term 'racialism' pre-dates this word) - the belief that human kind can be divided into 'races' like in Lord of the Rings. In the west we tried to inoculate people against it by attaching negative connotations to the term racism, and introducing into public discourse words like 'prejudice' and 'tolerance' - words that are themselves perfect little mini-arguments against automatic distrust of the 'other'.

But then in the late 20th Century individualism converged with certain ideas within neoliberal economics, and suddenly the attempt to use language and steer public discourse away from racism became termed 'political correctness', an aspect of the 'loony left'. People began to be told their their opinion, no matter how misinformed or ill conceived, was somehow valid.

Now, across the entire world right-wing parties are gaining ground, many of which are fascist in all but name, many of which are outright fascist. The people voting for them, by huge margins, do not consider themselves racist. Instead, they believe that their prejudiced conclusions are valid. The public will no longer tolerate attempts to use political correctness to steer them away from certain ideas, and are not interested in the renegotiation of cultural norms and values to accommodate people in an increasingly globalised world.

PACE was initially set up by the late William Siegel, who gave his three children roles in the running of the company for a period of time. Two left, whilst their brother Eric continued to maintain a keen interest in the assets of the business. However, having put Eric in charge of the US business, it became clear to William Siegel that the company was running into difficulties. So Siegel Senior asked Paul Dunham to transfer from the UK to the US to guide Eric in turning around the company's fortunes.
So in 2000, Paul and Sandra agreed to relocate to the US, for Paul to oversee Eric, on the basis that William Siegel would ensure the company funded all their relocation costs and relevant living expenses.
In time William determined that it would be in the best interest of the company for his son, Eric, to step aside. Eric had a spectacular falling out with his father as a result. Paul alleges in his sworn statement of proof to the UK court in the extradition proceedings, that Eric warned Paul that if he supported his father's removal of him he would take revenge. It appeared that Eric wrongly perceived Paul as having been a contributor to Eric's demise.
Following William's near-death experience in 2007, father and son reconciled and Eric succeeded in assuming control of the company with his father's support. Over the following 2 years, according to the court filings, it was clear that Paul, the management and Board of Directors were encumbered by Eric's decision-making. During this time, and apparently out of nowhere, both Paul and Sandra's salaries were cut by 40% by Eric. In May 2009, with Paul having tried hard to keep the company going despite Eric, which caused both he and his wife enormous stress, Paul and Sandra both resigned and returned to the UK, seeking professional medical help.

Shortly after the Dunham's resignation, Eric saw fit to try to claim that the Dunhams had improperly claimed expenses from the company and sued them in a court in North Carolina. Notwithstanding the fact according to the Dunhams, all expenses claimed had always been authorised and paid to them by the company's accountant, and all the books audited by professional advisors and signed off by William Siegel each year. Yet without the funds to defend themselves, the US court found in Eric/PACE's favour. This appears to have emboldened Eric into turning a civil matter into a criminal complaint over which the DoJ is now demanding the Dunham's extradition.
Far from assisting the Dunhams, the UK government is using UK taxpayers' money to fund a highly-qualified barrister to represent the US in court against the Dunhams. However when the Dunhams themselves first requested the same level of legal advice through legal aid, they were told they did not need the services of a barrister to defend their case! So much for equality of arms.
Eric, via PACE, via the DoJ, is trying to claim that Sandra aided and abetted her husband's wrongful expenses claims, and by using their money overseas, astonishingly the charges have been characterised by the DoJ as money laundering!

And neither us dispute that this is a problem (hell, as a gay man myself, I've received homophobic abuse from Jamaicans (the phrase ""You battybois will never enter the Kingdom of God"" came up..)).  I'm very much for an immigration policy that pretty much states that if you come to the UK, you need to need to respect that we hold a different set of values and customs to the ones you may be used to, and if you aren't willing to respect our ways, we are under no obligation to respect yours, and you can kindly leave the country. If you are a guest in another person's home, and trash their kitchen, expect to be asked to leave.

But it is difficult to deny the multicultural aspect of British culture, whereby you can go down the road to a Polish corner shop to buy Chinese tea.  There are ups and downs to our culture, but it is our culture.

The *Pax Romana* was established as state policy by Augustus, the first emperor. By the time of the transition from Republic to Empire, much of the Empire's eventual territory was already established, and many of the regions even outside Italy had been under Roman domination for centuries. The *Pax Romana* was a reason people who already considered themselves Roman stayed within the Empire, but it was not generally a reason for other people to submit to Roman rule. Indeed, warfare was so common to the Romans that the very concept of peace when there are still potential enemies to fight took quite some persuasion for the masses.

Finances, if you do go to Greenwich, you're going to need a decent budget, greater than if you were studying outside London.  A small room in one of Greenwich's student halls is £138.81 per week. After first year you'll likely need to move into private accommodation and be paying probably at least £500 a month just on rent, plus extra for bills like electricity and water (unless you have a landlord who does it for you), then everything else on top of that; transport if needed, food, going out etc.

You won't be able to get any money from the UK government for your living costs since you don't live here. If the Dutch government lets you get finance to use abroad check you get enough to live in London. In the UK students get a few extra thousand pounds per year if their university is in London.

If you search university guide you can find loads of articles about student life in the UK and at specific universities you're interested in.

Is it a wise move? I don't know. It's up to you to see if it's worth it. Since 2012 university has been a lot more expensive, £9000 in fees at most universities per year, up from £3300. Which I believe is a lot more than what it'd cost you in the Netherlands or many other EU countries. I moved to London to go to university and I love it.

Read up on the Convention rights, Liberty GB should remember that under Article 15 of the ECHR a state may be able to derogate from the  Convention in times of war or public emergency threatening the life of the nation, the only parts this cannot apply are for torture, slavery or retrospective criminal offences or right to life except for lawful acts of war. 

Section 1 incorporates and gives effect to the Convention rights.
Section 2: domestic courts must take into  account judgements of the ECtHr BUT ARE NOT BOUND TO FOLLOW THEM. 

Section 3: So far as it is possible to do so, primary and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights, this applies to past and future legislation.

Section 4 the High Court and other higher courts may declare an Act of Parliament to be incompatible with convention rights. Courts cannot act incompatibly with convention rights under section 6. 

Courts cannot question the  validity or continuing operation or enforcement of a parliamentary provision, but more or less puts political pressure on Government to change the law. 

It is not like a European Court issuing dictats banning Theresa May from ejecting the nasty preacher. It is an aid for our own UK courts to  hold our own government to account.

&gt;The point about it being an island is just an aesthetic point to hammer home the fact that we are a relatively small country and we do have finite space.

So you expect continental countries to expand into their neighbours when they run out of room? Russia might be making land grabs but they're hardly suffering population pressure. 

&gt;We can't keep on with net migration figures of 250,000 a year forever, you know. There will come a point where we have to say ""we just can't handle any more people""

Uh, no. That's what's under dispute here. 

And the population grew by more than 250,000 a year for much of the last century, without complaint. Of course, that was natural increase, not foreigners... 

&gt;Personally I think we should avoid that and restore a sensible immigration policy of 30,000 a year.

Why is 30,000 any more sensible than 3,000 or 300,000? A sensible policy would be based on economic benefit tempered with humane principles, not an arbitrary hard cap. 

&gt;I don't share your view that we should just keep building and building to deal with the influx of migrants.

I don't know what that this test exactly is. My university makes this reference to Cambridge tests if one of these is the same test you did:
Cambridge Certificate of Proficiency in English (CPE) with grade C or better.
Cambridge Advanced Certificate of English (CAE) with a grade B or better.
Cambridge English Language (1119) conducted overseas by the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate: B4 or better.
 
Most universities ask for IELTS scores around 6.0. But they all have their own requirements so check with them.

&gt; So, I am not eligible for any student loans at all from the English government? Because, if I move to London, do I not technically live there, or is it because I have to English citizenship?

You have to have lived in the UK for three years prior to starting your course to get maintenance funding from governments here.

&gt;The thing is, the quaran and haddith demand you pray 5 times a day, most Muslims don't bother. 

Some do some dont. Most of the muslims I know do. 

That comment hits upon one of the fundamental arguments behind islamism however.

There is one topic common to islamist movements and that is to recreate an islamic state where sharia is the law, and a caliph is nominated as a leader and ultimate legal arbiter. Different movements propose different solutions  on how to achieve that goal, but its a commonality.

The main political philosopher that defined the modern concept of the islamic state was a guy called Abul Ala Maududi. When he definef that concept, the Russia empire had just fallen to the communists a set of ideas literally took down the Russian Empire, the British Empire was dissolving and the Ottoman Empire was beaten in world war 1. So this guy maududi proposed the idea of a new islamic state ruled under sharia. He was very a smart guy, a big thinker, a brilliant writer.

The basis for his ideas came from the Hegelian dialectic of history. He wroted that history saw a battle between islam and jahiliyyah (the state of ignorance existing in the world prior to islam). He believed that muslims in the early 20th century were living in jahiliyyah, since they were born muslims but didnt act like muslims (he called them basically postcode muslims) therefore what was required was the implementation of an islamic state and that a vanguard of muslims create this state. 

His ideas were picked up and expanded by Sayyed Qutb, an Egyptian who wrote that because the world in a state of Jahiliyyah and only the vanguard striving to create this islamic state could really consider themselves the real true muslims, it was okay to kill not just kuffar but also other muslims too. This ideology is known as takfir.

So the basis of all islamist movements is the creation of the khilafa.

&gt;Well I believe many Muslims would like sharia or at least wouldn't stand in its way.

Sharia is the system of religious governance for islam, it is a highly complex legal and admistrative system for governing society. It defines the rules by which muslims abide by.It is far more than simply chopping off hands and executing apostates. Sharia law has never applied to non-muslims. Sharia law only makes sense where there is an islamic state with a caliph who is the highest legal body for the religion. Judaism has similar legal structures. It therefore makes sense that some muslims would prefer that to law made by non-muslims. 

&gt; As for why they aren't violent Islamists.  I would say that by default most people aren't violent. Most fascists have never killed anyone for instance.

Some are and explicitly so, these people are known as takfiris or salafi jihadists. Other islamist organisation such as hizb-al-tahrir propose to implement a caliphate by means of military coup, others like the muslim brotherhood in Egypt and Ennhada in Tunisia aim to achieve a caliphate via social movement and mass support. It is said the Fethullah Gülen is trying to build a movement of intellectuals.


&gt; As for a firm percentage, I think I have read hovering around 5-10%. 

[If we take this report](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/al-qaeda/10672455/Joining-Syrian-ranks-of-aQaeda-in-vogue-for-young-British-Muslims.html) there have been up to 400 muslims from the UK that have gone to fight assad

[There are about 2.5 million muslims living in the UK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_by_country)

true,Korporalo,null,null,"&gt;If this was really about population pressure, you'd be looking for the most effective ways to reduce population growth, not seizing on immigration.

Immigration is something we CAN control. What's the alternative? A Chinese style one child policy? Involuntary euthanasia of anyone over 60?

We can educate people about population density and correct use of contraception but ultimately the main way we can limit population growth in Britain is by immigration control.

There is no real way to stop people who are here form having kids, other than committing to human rights abuses that frankly don't belong in a civilized nation.

&gt;Really? Because the noontime of the Empire saw huge amounts of urbanisation. Britain led the world in the growth of its cities.

And there is still countryside. What you are advocating is continuous building in order to house more and more people, the logical conclusion of which is the complete destruction and bricking over the countryside.

The British countryside is one of the best elements of our country. I for one don't want to see it bricked over with council estates and housing complexes.

You can hardly compare the initial urbanization of Britain that resulted in SOME areas being built up, with the complete bricking over of the countryside.

&gt;I'm happy to have ideals

There are ideals and then there is blind idealism. The fact that you actually support and want to actively increase the population density of Britain is not something that I would consider virtuous. I consider it to be incredibly naive and in 200 years time when the countryside has been bricked over and your great great grandchildren are living in a Bladerunner style Britain, you and your ""ideals"" will be to blame.

&gt;Not a duty; simple common sense.

Yes, because deliberately increasing the population at such a rate that we have to brick over the countryside and spend billions of tax payer money on building new council estates, housing complexes, schools and hospitals, is something that appeals to common sense.

&gt;If people want to come here and can contribute to our common happiness and wealth by doing so, why turn them away?

How delusional are you? The vast majority of people in Britain do not want to brick over the countryside and increase the population of the country at an unprecedented rate.

&gt;""Crowding"" just doesn't seem a pressing enough reason, unless it's cover for something more sinister.


It is perfectly rational to want to preserve the British landscape and not have a country that is overcrowded. The fact that you seem intent to imply that there is some sort of racial or ethnic motive behind this is telling.

Not only because the UK has influence in the EU, and because most of the law is either made in the courts or by parliament. It's only wider issues like European standarisation that is important for the EU, and is absolutely a good thing for economy.

I can't see any reason to fear immigration from the EU bar xenophobia, especially with the new rules on benefits. People will come here and work contributing to the economy or they'll go back home. Honestly I think people have an unrealistic belief that people in other parts of the EU are just desperate to be here, frankly we're no more desirable than many other EU member states. Apart from Western Ukraine and perhaps a few other Eastern European nations with very small populations I can't see anyone else joining the EU, certainly not enough people to make a difference. Turkey certainly won't join with the political situation there. Beyond that there's no possibility of countries joining the EU because they aren't geographically in the EU. 

The pros of being part of the EU are immense for business, as well as for British citizens who want to work and travel abroad. To be honest I don't think there is a real possibility of the EU, it's just a bunch of political bluster. If we did the consequences would be disastrous, not only for Britons abroad but also for employment, companies would pull out of the UK and we'd be left as an irrelevancy whilst Scandinavia, France and Germany filled the void. Britain is already falling massively behind wealthy European members but holding on the outmoded ideas about how business works in the 21st century, virtually all our money is made in the City of London which is terrible for the overall British population, leaving the EU would do nothing but exaggerate this leaving us as nothing more than a relic of the past.

true,IAmNotAmerican,cnty-expat,I don't belong here,"I don't think sexual orientation is ""changeable"", I just don't happen to think it is ""fixed"" in any sense.

I don't actually believe in categorising sexual preferences - I happen to think it is a sliding scale that evolves and changes naturally over the period of our emotional growth and maturity.

Have you heard of the [Kinsey Scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale) for example?

There are, of course, many studies and no matter which side the results come down upon it's always going to be controversial because the subject elicits a lot of emotions from all sides of the debate.

Let's just say I don't think there's such a thing as sexual orientation, I don't think there's such a thing as '~sexuality', I just believe in  'sexuality'. All this categorisation based on self-diagnosis, followed through to it's logical conclusion leads to very tiny niches - which is what we see in recent times with the extension of LGBT to LGBTQIA+.

Of course the main contention to my perspective on the matter is the fear that by advocating sexuality is about choice and preference - then that legitimises the idea that gay people can be cured.

Let me make it clear that I'm not arguing gay people can and should be 'cured', just as I wouldn't seriously suggest that vegans should be 'cured'. I think there's nothing wrong with choice, people have a right to choose their own path in life and I consider sex to be one of those choices that I think people make (subconsciously or not).

People are attracted to people at the end of the day - that's why most people don't leave their partners when they have breast removed, hysterectomies or are even rendered sexless.",0,1400361880,null,0,false,0,chkjzz4,t3_25n96t,t1_chkjzz4,t1_chk4vgx,null,1433841188,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Hydron8,null,null,"&gt;Reducing the birth rate through tweaks to the tax and benefit system, on the other hand... 

The native birth rate is already in terminal decline. Half the reason why we supposedly need high immigration is that it ""props up"" the elderly population, but of course as immigrants get older too we will need even more to come in to prop them up. This is also known as a ponzi scheme. 

The only reason we have population growth apart from immigration is that people are living longer. If we had low immigration levels, over the long term the population would be declining. Instead of accepting this and investing in advanced technology and other measures, our governments have decided to go for the short term fix of importing millions of people. 

&gt;I think you're confusing people's preferences with their voting intentions.

The majority of people won't back a party like UKIP because of all the added stuff that goes with them, mixed with a bit of tribal loyalty to labour/tory.

However the will of the public is clear- even a majority of labour supporters want immigration lowered- nearly half of people want ALL immigration stopped, a policy only adopted by the BNP. 

Again, please explain why imposing upon people a policy of high immigration that may please big business but is deeply unpopular with regular people is going to improve public happiness?

- Economy: recovered by making london a tax haven, inflating housing market and printing money. He's essentially privatised the deficit, and paid for it by taking from services for the most vulnerable 

- Domestic: Gay marriage his 'biggest regret', defended GCHQ to the hilt, done nothing to regulate press, ideological cuts to legal aid, racist vans, wants to make people stateless, more power to the police when after scandals involving their own ministers, powers for local authorities to ban protests, asbo+

- Foreign affairs: Screwed our relationship up with europe, made america hate us after syria and in/out pledge, screwed up in libya, abstained on israel/palestine vote, no asylum for snowden, dodgy trade deals  with corrupt dictorships

- Health: Waiting times up, crowded A&amp;E wards, privatised services, failed up health and social care act, not responded to future demands for health care, refuses to exempt health services form the transatlantic free trade agreement, secretary believes in homeopathy, hospitals closing left right and centre

- Education: Thinks its good that teachers don't like any of his ideas, money wasted on bibles in schools, free school vanity project fiasco, teacher's strike, return to weird colonial tory curriculum, centralising plenty of powers, cheerleading academy programme 

- Welfare: Universal credit failure, atos sigmitising the disabled, benefit cap pandering to daily mail, housing benefit removed for under-25s, unemployment benefit virtually scrapped at a time when we should be moving towards a universal basic income, pensions age raised, tax credits cut, student finance cut, zero-hour contracts rife, ridiculous benefit assessments, 1 million under food banks...


That's just a snapshot and I could go on to and he has screwed up every sngle policy area.

Yes. 

&gt;Let's just say I don't think there's such a thing as sexual orientation, I don't think there's such a thing as '~sexuality', I just believe in 'sexuality'. All this categorisation based on self-diagnosis, followed through to it's logical conclusion leads to very tiny niches - which is what we see in recent times with the extension of LGBT to LGBTQIA+.

If you're going to posit that sexual orientations don't exist, then you are going to need a lot of evidence to contradict the massive research already existing on orientation. Yes, sexual orientation is a gradient rather than a binary straight|gay or trinary straight|bi|gay, but it's still fixed near whatever point of the gradient it's on.

&gt;People are attracted to people at the end of the day - that's why most people don't leave their partners when they have breast removed, hysterectomies or are even rendered sexless.

If this is true then why don't straight men fall in love with men they're extremely close to? I've had tons of friends who I mesh extremely well with yet would never be sexually attracted to.

true,[deleted],null,null,"European Council:

The European Council is made up of the 28 European Union member heads of state e.g. David Cameron, Angela Merkel, Francois Holland etc

They meet at least once a year to discuss policy and the direction in which the Union should take in the upcoming year.

The European Commission:

The European Commission is made up of 28 appointed commissioners; one from each member state. They are there to turn the policy the European Council proposes into proposed legislation that will then go to the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament which is known as the Ordinary Legislative Procedure.

The Commissioners form the equivalent of a European Executive and are there to promote the Union and not the country they originate from. Each Commissioner also takes charge of a certain area of policy e.g. the UK Commissioner is in charge of European Foreign Affairs.

The Commission also takes the role of being the ""policemen of Europe"". If a European member state is accused of breaking European law, the Commission will issue a warning where if the state fails to comply then they are taken to the Court of Justice of the European Union.

Council of the European Union (Council of Ministers):

The Council of the European Union is made up of ministers from member state governments. Depending on which area of policy is under scrutiny then the relevant minister will attend the meetings e.g. Ukraine - William Hague. Euro-crisis - George Osbourne. 

Along with the European Parliament the Council of Ministers will scrutinise the proposed legislation from the Commission. Both institutions have to agree before it becomes European Law. 

The European Parliament:

The European Parliament is made up of 766 democratically elected MEPs who represent European Citizens from their area. Depending upon the size of the member state depends on how many MEPs originate from the member states e.g. Germany have 96 MEPs, UK 73 MEPs and Malta 5 MEPs. (*These numbers are from the top of my head and may be wrong; the amount of MEPs are also being reduced in the next European elections*). Due to the fact that the amount of MEPs a nation has is proportional to the size, Germany, France and contrary to popular belief the UK dominate policy as these are the three largest member states; according to population.

Along with the Council of Ministers the European Parliament scrutinises legislation proposed by the Commission, and since the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament has enjoyed more power due to calls for the Union to be more democratic. Due to these reforms the European Parliament is now able to make amendments without the support of the Council of Ministers, providing the Commission agrees, and can stop proposed legislation in its tracks even if the Council wish for it to be implemented.

The Court of Justice of the European Union:

The Court of Justice is made up of 28 judges, one from each member state, and judge on European Law. Claims can be bought by (1) the Commission upon a member state or (2) a member state upon a fellow member state. 

If a member nation has been found to breach European law, then they are often fined. One example is Greece who hadn't implemented a European Directive on Waste Management. They were fined €20, 000 a day until it was made law by Greece.",0,1400363198,null,0,false,0,chkkgtn,t3_25s5w2,t1_chkkgtn,t3_25s5w2,null,1433841410,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;Immigration is something we CAN control. What's the alternative? A Chinese style one child policy? Involuntary euthanasia of anyone over 60?


Ah, the totalitarian mindset. Having children is a rational act and one which responds to economic circumstances. In policy terms: tax, benefits. 

And immigration isn't something that governments can control just by turning a knob. Policies have real consequences. 

&gt;And there is still countryside. What you are advocating is continuous building in order to house more and more people, the logical conclusion of which is the complete destruction and bricking over the countryside.

That's your logical conclusion. Not mine. 

&gt;You can hardly compare the initial urbanization of Britain that resulted in SOME areas being built up, with the complete bricking over of the countryside.

I'm not making that comparison. 

&gt;There are ideals and then there is blind idealism. The fact that you actually support and want to actively increase the population density of Britain is not something that I would consider virtuous. I consider it to be incredibly naive and in 200 years time when the countryside has been bricked over and your great great grandchildren are living in a Bladerunner style Britain, you and your ""ideals"" will be to blame.

We can preserve the countryside while accommodating modest population increase, some of that from immigration. 

&gt;Yes, because deliberately increasing the population at such a rate that we have to brick over the countryside and spend billions of tax payer money on building new council estates, housing complexes, schools and hospitals, is something that appeals to common sense.

Immigrants pay taxes. 

&gt;It is perfectly rational to want to preserve the British landscape and not have a country that is overcrowded. The fact that you seem intent to imply that there is some sort of racial or ethnic motive behind this is telling.

What difference does it make if the next million British residents are born here or abroad, unless your motives are racist? 

If this was really about overcrowding and greenfield build, then all solutions would be on the table. But it isn't, which is why ""overcrowding"" is legitimately seen as a code word.

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"But we'd probably be in a worse economic state too. Dealing with an economic crisis with a minority government would be impossible and international markets etc would have lost confidence in the government to do anything - after all the ability of a government to raise money cheaply entirely depends on whether the markets trust the government to be able to prevent itself going bankrupt. With a minority government there would have been a real possibility that the Commons would be too caught up in political infighting to be able to do anything in time. 

Also the Lib Dems in government have managed to pass some things they wanted to pass - they rasied the threshold for paying income tax, curtailed some of the government's counter-terrorism powers, stopped the police retaining the fingerprints and and DNA of people acquitted of crimes and had a referendum on AV (even if the public was unable to see the benefits of it). They've also done a lot for renewable energy and environmental policy like banning new coal power stations without CC&amp;S technology and setting new targets for cutting of greenhouse gasses because they've had control of the Environment Department. David Cameron has said before as well that he has a 'little black book' of policies that the Lib Dems opposed than he was unable to get passed. In other words this coalition has been better (if you oppose the Tories) than a Tory majority and more active economically than a Tory minority. 

It was probably stupid of Clegg to promise he would never raise tuition fees because he should have foreseen a coalition with the Tories where he might be forced to - it was in the Tory manifesto before 2010 after all. But that doesn't mean we should have expected him to both doom the country to passivity in the face of economic crisis while also passing up on the opportunity to get some Lib Dem policies passed for the first time in a century or so. What we certainly shouldn't do is let the Tories off the hook for the policies people haven't liked by deciding to blame the junior party in the coalition.

Andy, meanwhile, [has the second worst conversion rate in the PL.](http://www.statsbomb.com/2014/05/the-sodden-boot-the-worst-finisher-in-the-premier-league/)

Bearing in mind that those are measuring different stats, I also did some digging to determine how many shots Andy has made on goal during this campaign. I found a figure of 14 total, on goal.  Assuming that to be correct, and knowing that he added two goals for us the entire season, Andy successfully finds the net 1/7th of the time -- or a conversion rate of 14.2%.

Like I said in another thread -- 15M pounds well spent...

Edit:  The rate could be even worse for Andy; the [source I found](http://bit.ly/1jq4cVw) for Andy's shot total stated that it excluded 9 shots he made that were blocked -- that seems a bit shady, to me.  As the site gave no indication of whether those would have been considered on or off target, I chose to exclude those from my math.  However: assuming they were all **on** target, that would drop Andy's conversion rate to 2/21, or 9.5%.  If they would all have been off target, then the 14.2% figure stands.

&gt;The native birth rate is already in terminal decline. Half the reason why we supposedly need high immigration is that it ""props up"" the elderly population, but of course as immigrants get older too we will need even more to come in to prop them up. This is also known as a ponzi scheme. 

A Ponzi scheme is defined by excess growth rates. Immigration is far below the trend growth rate of the economy. 

&gt;The only reason we have population growth apart from immigration is that people are living longer. If we had low immigration levels, over the long term the population would be declining. Instead of accepting this and investing in advanced technology and other measures, our governments have decided to go for the short term fix of importing millions of people. 

You think immigration is decided by the government? I think you give the technocracy far too much credit. 

&gt;However the will of the public is clear- even a majority of labour supporters want immigration lowered- nearly half of people want ALL immigration stopped, a policy only adopted by the BNP. 

Which shows how utterly unfeasible it is. 

&gt;Again, please explain why imposing upon people a policy of high immigration that may please big business but is deeply unpopular with regular people is going to improve public happiness? 

Almost every premise of your question is wrong. Current immigration policy isn't imposed, it's decided by democratically elected governments. It isn't high or lax in any way; it results in families torn apart and people who've given decades to this country turfed out. Big business will move elsewhere if it can't satisfy hiring; it's small and medium businesses that will suffer if skilled people are kept out. And ordinary people are happy if they have a good, stable job with a bit left over at the end of the month; they don't lie awake at night worrying over the fate of a few acres of factory land or turnip field - or a line on an ONS spreadsheet. 

Any broad unpopularity is superficial; depth of feeling only exists among closet racists who've realised that immigration restriction is for now an acceptable face. 

Immigration levels are the result of many factors outside this country; a massive decrease would be impossible without highly damaging restrictions. The average voter might not be happy with that, but they recognise its essential truth.

true,spiz,null,null,"&gt; The problem is that because of the centralization of power, it IS anti-democratic.

I suppose that depends on your definition of democracy.  The US is a democracy, but it's more centralised than the EU.  Does that mean it's less democratic?  If you go the other way, would complete anarchy be more democratic?  There are different systems under which we implement democratic principles, the EU applies one which is appropriate for its role as a supranational body.  Fundamentally, the EU isn't a country and consequently can't really behave as one.

&gt; You are aware that some of these have never appeared on ANY PUBLIC BALLOT EVER? Catherine Ashton has never once been voted into ANYTHING. Yet she sits on a commission of 28 people who are the only people in Europe with the right to propose EU legislation.

That doesn't make a blind bit of difference.  We voted in our government, that, in turn appointed a representative.  You don't vote on all the people the government appoints.  As I mentioned before, the EU isn't a country and this measure allows the local governments an important stake in controlling the right of initiative in the EU.  This is important because local governments are ""powerful"" relative to the EU (e.g. as opposed to the States in the United States). Are you this upset about appointments to the House of Lords?

The EU could certainly have a directly elected commission, but then it would be accountable to the people and not the governments of the member states.  Do you see the diplomatic problem?

Having said that, the European Parliament (which is directly elected) can ask the commission to put forward a proposal, but having it go through the Commission keeps ""institutional balance"", meaning different EU institutions don't overstep their boundaries and it consequently stops the EU overstepping and upsetting member states.  I think that being a supranational body, rather than a country, makes this important.

&gt; Would it be democratic if David Cameron said ""well, I've been elected as an MP, so I'm now going to appoint this random bloke off the street who has never been on a public ballot to an extremely powerful position""?

That's how Italy's got its last three prime ministers (the papers ironically refer to this as being ""post-democratic"").  I don't recall electing the Queen, or any elected representative appointing her either.  A similar thing goes for the House of Lords (Bishops and all).  Also, refer to my previous point about the role of the Commission.

&gt; I think it is perfectly fair to say that people who are ""appointed"" are NOT elected.

Yes, it is.  It is **not** fair to say the process is not democratic.  Otherwise, by a simple extension of your argument, no government appointment is democratic, and by stretching it only a little further, no government decision is democratic either.

&gt; The EU is an order of magnitude less democratic than that.

At least you're consistent in your argument - I always admire that.  To keep the same ratio of representatives across the EU (1450 for 60M), you would need nearly 18,000 representatives.  Farage's brain might explode at the thought (and rightly so).  The EU doesn't perform the function of local government, and that's why we have local government.  The EU's powers are limited and it has representation to reflect a **very** different role.  There's heavier representation at local government level, because it can do more (again the balance of power lies with the member states and not the union).

I don't think the EU is ""undemocratic"", and certainly not ""anti-democratic"".  It could certainly be _more_ democratic, but I'm not sure how much it could do this without causing a lot of bother with member states.

He's been on the bench twice for the first team even though he's only 16, and from what I've seen he's a deep sitting midfielder with a great passing ability. 

He says he likes to get the forwards playing football, sounds like he enjoys linking up attack and defense more than getting forward himself, although [he does have an eye for goal.](http://gfycat.com/UnnaturalChubbyDonkey) I think we'll see more of him in pre-season, and since he's too young to go out on loan he might play a few cup or European games next season.

Jonjoe Kenny is also a regular in the England under 17s, he got his first goal for them the other day which is great for a defender. He can play RB or LB, although he's right footed so is more suited to right back.

Then there's Joe Williams who was voted under 18 player of the season. I haven't seen too much of him and all I know is he's a midfielder that got [sent off for a bad tackle during the under 18 derby](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iZ7SdyaubU) which is quite a feat, I didn't think they actually gave out red cards in those youth matches. He's made a few appearances for the under 21s so he's making good progress for a 17 year old.

Those are probably the most promising under 18s, Tyias Browning (CB) and Luke Garbutt (LB) are under 21s that have been on our bench for the last few months and recently got a call up to the under 21 England team, so they seem good prospects too.

true,Hydron8,null,null,"&gt; A Ponzi scheme is defined by excess growth rates. Immigration is far below the trend growth rate of the economy. 

I wasn't referring to the economy but the idea that we need more people in the workforce to care for the aging population. And when those people get old, we'll need more people to care for them...

&gt;You think immigration is decided by the government?

Err, undoubtedly. The government is responsible for the UK border force and should be responsible for who and who isn't allowed into the country. This is one of the primary purposes of government. 

&gt;Current immigration policy isn't imposed, it's decided by democratically elected governments

Who go against the will of the people. The government is supposed to serve the people, not the other way around. The fact most voters base their decision on the economy or tribal loyalty shouldn't hide the fact that if the overwhelming majority of the country want something, the politicians should act upon it. Labour made no mention in their 1997 manifesto that they would allow the numbers to hugely increase- in fact they hinted the opposite. Complete deception. 

&gt;It isn't high or lax in any way

Immigration is currently running at 532,000 a year, 212,000 net. Either you regard 212,000 people a year (a city the size of Norwich added to the population each year) as high or not. 

&gt;small and medium businesses that will suffer if skilled people are kept out

Are you saying that literally none of the millions of unemployed people in the UK are able to do these ""skilled"" jobs? Do you think it's better for the nation to train up unemployed young people to do the jobs or simply import workers from abroad? No-one serious is suggesting stopping ALL skill migration, but the idea that there are 212,000 jobs that NO British person could possibly do is laughable. 

&gt;depth of feeling only exists among closet racists who've realised that immigration restriction is for now an acceptable face. 

There must be a hell of a lot of racists in the UK then, myself included. Always nice to be told that I dislike people on the basis of their skin because I am concerned about high immigration.

true,TechJesus,null,null,"&gt; See, the sun is owned by News UK which is owned by Rupert Murdoch and, to a lesser extent, his son James. Rupert Murdoch is a man who has been known to add his own politics to his pages, not unlike the Rotherfelds, who own the Mail.

Nick Davies, a Guardian journalist, wrote in Flat Earth News that while proprietors did on occasion mess with the editorial line of their papers, the problem was much less prevalent than is popularly imagined. Indeed the main bogeyman in the book is public relations agencies, coupled with a factory approach to newsmaking particularly prevalent in the local press. In other words, money is a far bigger problem than ideology in driving proprietorial influence.

Murdoch does have opinions and interests, but anyone who has read up on his history would have to conclude that business is what matters to him. His main appearances in Private Eye concern puff pieces about films/TV his other companies are making, the hacking trial notwithstanding. Anyway, the misbehaviour of Sun/New of the Screws journalists was also fundamentally about money, not politics.  

The problem with the British press is not that that it cares too much about politics, it's that it cares so little about politics that it is willing to play ideology as a marketing gimmick.

You can't treat pedophilia as simply a part of someone's character that ought to be respected and understood because the expression of pedophilia means people are attacked and raped. Jeffery Dahmer was a reasonable dude in most aspects of his life, but he had a sexual compulsion that required murdering and mutilating the bodies of other adults. He's expressed in interviews that he really, *really* did need to murder those dudes to fully express his sexuality, that was just part of how he got off. Does that make it okay? Does that mean we should be understanding and accepting? No, because the lives and well-being of other people is more important than some dude's boner. Everyone has a basic right to not be raped or killed for simply existing in the same space as someone with a violent sexual compulsion. 

If you do have something inside you that drives you to hurt others, I feel for you. It's not fair that you have that compulsion. But you're burdened with having to fight it and never, ever expressing it, sorry, but that's the way it is. Where do you draw the line? Adam Lanza felt compelled to go on a shooting rampage, something in his brain told him that's something he needed to do. But people died and were seriously injured so it's *not* okay, no matter how important it was to him to do it. What about people who suicide bomb buildings? People who rape adults?

Still, better to not have them.

It's hard to say if we'd have more Green MPs. Without a proper multi-seat proportional voting system, I think in general, we wouldn't have more Green MPs. Other than Brighton Pavilion, there's nowhere where they have a significant proportion of the vote. AV would reduce tactical voting, so you might get a little bit of a stronger support, but I still doubt it would be enough to win a constituency outright. 

The closest is Norwich South, where in 2010, the Greens got 15% of the vote and came in fourth. They also have some support around Oxford, but they only polled around 2-3% in both Oxford East and Oxford West and Abingdon.

Having debuted for us in 2009/10 season (I think) he has gone on to be a constant loaned player but unfortunately, has struggled to stick with clubs for more than a season due to a number of circumstances. 

He marauds down the left for youth team incubator, Vitesse Arnhem at the moment and his form has led him to be called up to the Netherlands World Cup squad, even though at LB they are spoiled for choice. 

When discussing heirs to Cole's throne, why haven't I heard much of Patrick playing a part in the mix; he must be at least on par with Bertrand if he's in such form at the moment. He's younger than Bertrand and the Eredevisie has so far fostered many of our players to a decent standard (see Piazon, Kalas, Matic - to an extent) so we can't say it isn't a negative point that PVA plays there- though his experience at Wigan was worrying.

Next was Nacho Monreal for Arsenal, who won 82.6% of the 23 matches in which he played this season.

It's interesting to think about. I know I've been a big proponent of building the team and the defence to incorporate Sakho, and I still feel that way, but I honestly didn't think Agger would be the player with the highest win percentage in our side.

Where is any evidence of financial trashing? The NHS had consecutive, massive funding increases under Labour, but quality of care didn't really improve in line with those increases. In recent years, the NHS has had slight increases to match inflation and rising population. There haven't been any cuts to the NHS budget. Certainly nothing you could call ""financial trashing"".

Secondly, is there any REAL evidence of privatisation? Private services have been integrated with the NHS since pretty much day one. Bear in mind that your GP surgery is likely private (over 80% are), your pharmacy is private (Boots is owned by a huge American conglomerate, Walgreens), and all the companies making drugs are private. The NHS is about publicly funding healthcare and supplying it free at the point of use. It has never required everybody involved to be a government employee, and it has never meant that nobody is allowed to make profit from providing services.

Also yes, scalar analysis of filming images comes into play.

You also have seen it on screen - the 50th anniversary was the last time the season 7b box was used in its entirety, Capaldis was then used in the Christmas Special ""Time of The Doctor""

Capaldis is a lot richer. The season 5 smith box was metallic, it used car paint, specifically Subaru - ""Legacy Blue Pearl""

This continued up to Season 7A and then they swapped it for the season 7b model. Not shiny anymore a solid quite pale blue.

Now Capaldis is very rich in colour, quite a royal blue. If you can get down to Earls Court to see the original Police Box there, it's just been repainted in a similar colour to Capaldis - or so I'm told.

EDIT: here are some great images of season 7b vs season 8 boxes to play spot the difference with. Some bits like the colour and windows are obvious, others are less so like certain dimensions, but that's all part of the fun. Happy hunting!

Yes people should feel protected, but the person who does get drunk should also not be overly punished. He properly got to drunk because celebrating, this brought out some emotions. 

I can remember one time I got so drunk I started crying about my dead Grandad on the train, i was making sobbing noises and hitting the chair in anger, suddenly the guard came over spoke to me, that if i didn't stop i would be chucked off, I explained to him (as best i could as I was drunk), he sat me down, eventually I got to my stop and it was fine.

* Periodic proof of reserves and liabilities in bitcoin and cash

* Cold storage for majority of bitcoin reserves

* Publicised procedure preventing any one company officer from single-handedly stealing the coins in cold storage

* Option for a user to irrevocably lock a bitcoin withdrawal address to an account, and not be able to withdraw to a different address

* Optioinal 2FA to include yubikeys (this probably isn't worthwhile for you, but you asked for my wishes, and I don't have a mobile phone).

* Exchange to process transactions strictly in order (shouldn't have to mention this, but bitstamp doesn't seem to do it).

* Transparent order book, trade history and price history viewable by non-members

* Information about why my text is not appearing on the same line as my dots

My advice would be to work initially on building up market depth, possibly by having no charges at first.  Exchanges have a network effect: the more people that use them, the more they will be used, in the end there will probably be only one for each market (eg UK).

Other UK exchanges have failed because they aren't able to build up to a critical level of use, and you probably will too.  You need people to leave bitcoins and cash in the orderbook, but for them to be relaxed about doing that, you need to cover the security points above.

Also, possibly have no trading fees for limit orders to encourage market depth.

First things first, the restaurants list is still pretty much up to date. There might be some minor changes here and there, and a few new places have opened up since, but the rest stands.

About sightseeing, and since you have limited time, the one landmark you should definitely try to go visit is the Royal Pavilion. I think it's worth it, and the one thing you will not find anywhere else. The rest will depend on your tastes: there's the aquarium, the Brighton Pier, North Laine and The Lanes (which is mostly shopping), the promenade... There are two or three Brighton tourism websites where you can find information aplenty.

If you are arriving soon you should keep in mind we are in the middle of the Brighton Festival (until May 25) and its Fringe counterpart (until June 1), so there might be something there of your interest.

It's slightly naive to think that help to buy hasn't affected the rental market, but current evidence for this is anecdotal, sure. 

Either way, unless you're on a £25k plus income, it's difficult to find anywhere to live, and unless on a £60k plus income, pretty much impossible to buy a home.

I'm not saying he's done a perfect or even great job, but I think he's done pretty well. Who *that was also available and interested* would have done the *job* significantly better?

There's plenty of things I'm not convinced about. The sell off of the royal mail for one, but maybe that too will work out for the best. (In the coming future, is the government the right organisation to be running a parcel delivery service?).

Will I be voting Conservative at the next election? No, probably not. More than likely I'll vote LibDem, purely because I'd like to see what they make of it if they ever manage to get into power. 

We don't live in the the simplistic, black and white idealist world that most armchair political commentators seem to think we do. Overall, I think DC has navigated Britain through some challenging times and done so with wit, class and relative efficacy.

They have all made claims along the lines of 'we need to stay in the EU and transform it from within' Unfortunately none of them will be able to deliver, there has never been any wide sweeping changes in the EU and they're not likely to roll back any of their powers of our national affairs any time soon, in fact they actually want more control over sovereign nations affairs.

And then we turn to UKIP. It's unfortunate that most of the stuff I read on here or see on the main stream media is Ad hominem attack on Mr Farage and anyone in the party who says something stupid. UKIP are the only party who actively wants us out of the EU, which is the only sane and sensible course of action to anyone who has spent long enough looking into the current EU set up. 

This does not prevent us trading and having relationships with all other members of the EU. Nor does it prevent us from re-joining the EU should the massive and wide sweeping changes occur. 

I do not however agree with most of the UKIP policies when it comes to national government. They are conservative at heart and I am strongly against them, but when it comes to the European question they are the only ones speaking the truth.

A question to the EU fans. If there was such strong support for remaining in the EU why are we not allowed to have a say on staying in? The answer is simple.

true,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,"I could argue that I wouldn't trust a Guardian journalist to write anything accurate about the red-tops but honestly I think that particular point is a little bit moot. Murdoch's political affiliations are well-known, funding both the Conservatives in America and the Conservatives here in the UK, and I'm willing to bet if I looked into his activities in Australia I'd probably find evidence of political funding and attempted political influence there too.

The immigration issue has always been a right-wing thing. Left wing tabloids haven't banged that particular drum anywhere near as hard or as often. I don't consider it coincidence that over two countries with two very different political systems that both have two very different sets of values that one man's media outputs manages to maintain a consistent position on the political spectrum without direct interference if not from him then from someone high up.

In fact I decided to look up Murdoch's Australian activities and found a quote from the Leveson enquiry reportedly made by Tunku Varadarajan that quote ""Murdoch's name is synonymous with unethical newspapers"" and that his papers carried, among other things, massively politically biased headlines in the 2013 Australian Election in which it compared the then-left wing Prime Minister to a Nazi by photoshopping him into a Nazi Uniform and comparing the Labour canidate for the election to a clown. This from a man that according to Wikipedia owns 70% of the Media in Australia and...oh by the way the candidate that his papers backed won, and he's a Centre-Right candidate, despite the fact that his party is named the Liberal Party. (Looked at it on Wiki, apparantely the term refers to classical liberalism which today is more conservative than liberal, because apparantely those lines weren't blurry enough already.)

So, three continents, three media organisations, three political spectrums...all in line with this guy's beliefs. Yeah, I'm sorry. Nick Davies and Private Eye can write what they like, at some point this guy or someone this guy approves of decided to lean all his media to the right.

Actually I ought to thank you for bringing up the Eye since it jogged my memory some. The Sun, the New York Post and a few other Murdoch-owned rags have strenuously backed the act of fracking, and even mixed politics in with that when the Sun called David Cameron a hypocrite for opposing Fracking in his constituency but supporting it in principle. Fun fact: American Shale Oil, a company that wants to make use of fracking, has been backed by...Rupert Murdoch. This was reported in...actually I think it was the most recent Eye, either that or the penultimate one. So, thanks for that.

Honestly the more I look into this, the less dissent from Murdoch's desires I see. I'm not gonna claim the guy's micromanaging a media empire at the ripe old of age of 83, but it seems pretty clear that if not him then someone close to him or someone who shares his beliefs is influencing the direction of his empire. Even if all he does is demand that his editors and board members have right-wing beliefs, that's still interference.",0,1400409691,null,0,false,0,chkx5p4,t3_25s0sm,t1_chkx5p4,t1_chkmm5c,null,1433847458,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

What is vital is to renovate existing, unused homes and buildings, I'm sure I read/heard somewhere that there is a huge market of unused homes in London.

But ofc doing this will cost a lot of money and I doubt many people would enjoy living in apartments, unless they are well built. Badly build ones are atrocious if the people living above you is noisy and any form of renovation/DIY stuff is a big hassle.

true,Tearsofdrunk,eng-sussex,Celt in South Saxon land,"Yeah obviously everyone will have different perspectives so here's mine;

Labour don't seem to be saying much about the EU. They're broadly supportive of in but they've made it clear that it is not a priority and they're focusing on the cost of living and the NHS as their talking points.

Lib Dems are calling themselves 'the party of in'. They've made vague comments about reform being needed but overall are trying to position themselves as the party for those who want to remain in the EU (and in OP's case at least, we can see how successful they have been in the fact that they weren't even included in the title post).

Conservatives are a tricky one. David Cameron has committed to a straight up in/out referendum in 2017. The party itself is deeply divided on the issue with some members being staunchly pro-EU (see Ken Clarke) and a sizable chunk who are more in line with UKIP. It's my belief that the current party leadership is generally in favour of continued involvement in the EU and are going to seek some largely symbolic reform in the EU to mollify the party faithful. This probably wont be too successful in the long term. Honestly given the divisive nature of this subject within the conservative party it's a testament to their almost military like nature that they have managed to come up with a cohesive policy and campaign on it.

UKIP are the party of out and have managed to make themselves a serious problem for all parties. As always the negative voice shouts the loudest and they have received the lions share of media attention throughout this campaign. This was looking like the election that would change them from a protest vote to a party which can deliver policy. However, intensive media scrutiny, a rally from the conservatives and a recent very high profile gaff from ol' Nige has hindered their chances.

So in summary; Labour are the party of ""eh"", the Lib Dems are the party of ""in, but change"", the Conservatives are the party of ""lets have a referendum"" and UKIP are the party of ""out"", both in the EU sense and in the racist closet sense.

true,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,"It seems he's being worked at in stages. When he first came, he was a wonderfully gifted attacking player with a very keen eye for a pass and the ability to actually execute said pass (unlike a certain Mr. Shelvey). This year, he has turned into something more than that - an actual *team* player. 

I have to be honest here, it's a transition that I didn't quite notice at first until I read some of his defensive statistics - tackles, pressing and the like - and these really surprised me. They didn't fit the box I had him in. Since then, I spent a few games focussing on his play and really came to understand and appreciate all the unseen hard work he does. 

On paper, a midfield trio of Gerrard, Henderson and Coutinho didn't make sense to me (be it as part of a 4-3-3 or the DM/CM part of a diamond). Whilst both Gerrard and Henderson are defensively active, the former is still adapting to the role and the latter is a box to box player, leaving us somewhat vulnerable on the counter. Seeing what Coutinho does, I can now see how this midfield triumvirate can work, with Henderson and Coutinho almost operating as a box to box see-saw in front of Gerrard. Having said that, there is definitely room for improvement. 

I have watched Coutinho a few times when he was at Inter/Espanyol and obviously the first half-season after he came here. That Coutinho and this year's Coutinho seem to me somewhat different players and the latter Coutinho is certainly a great evolution of the former. 

I do think the next stage of development for him - and this really goes for Henderson as well - is finishing and decision-making in the final third. Both were lacking in this respect this season (to varying degrees) and I wouldn't be surprised if their pre-season routines are geared to help them improve in this area. Knowing the talent they both have and seeing the improvement they have made thus far, I am optimistic in what they can achieve and if both develop to be midfielders capable of scoring 10+ goals in a season (along with all their already delicious assists), we are looking at yet another way to boost our goal-scoring prowess. 

We cannot rely on Suarez/Sturridge always playing and always scoring goals, so this element of attacking reliability will be very important. And if Suarez/Sturridge remain here, uninjured and retain their form? Well... excuse me while I get some tissues for my sudden salivating problem.

You only get an average if 16% growth if your investments pay off and your company is doing well. This means investments, new and innovative ideas, finding new markets to expand into. This, in turn, drives the creation of jobs and increases tax revenue. Which is nice.

Hence, lots of new people on the list are from new media; internet companies, computer games and the like. Things where you actually have to do something to make money. People who could quite easily do their job on say, the Isle of Man or Dublin if we start trying to clamp down on them.

Now, with regards to the super duper rich; they tend to be there because their family is in a lucrative industry. Problem is that the industry in question is usually gas and oil, which the majority is not being extracted here. Clamping down on them would just encourage them to move to another hub.

When I was doing teacher training, we were warned to give special consideration to students fasting for Ramadan, and had to sit and listen to one of the Muslim student teachers ramble on for about 15 minutes about what fasting meant to her. She actually got special praise from the tutor for trying to decsribe it as a form of ['reflexive practice'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice). I remember thinking that I doubted many of the pupils we were training to teach would be likely to have had a proper breakfast before class on any given day, Muslim or not, and that we should actually be encouraging them to eat properly and understand the role of nutrition and regular mealtimes in learning, not pandering to peculiar religious practices such as fasting.

I'm politically left-wing, and I hate to sound like some Dail Mail reader, but I have to reluctantly say, I blame middle-class liberal / progressive / multicultural types in allowing religious 'tolerance' to run riot in schools to such an extent that some are now warping into faith-based institutions.

But O'Brien never really gave him a chance to explain himself either, instead preferring to bully him into saying more potentially racist stuff.

&gt; The immigration issue has always been a right-wing thing. Left wing tabloids haven't banged that particular drum anywhere near as hard or as often. I don't consider it coincidence that over two countries with two very different political systems that both have two very different sets of values that one man's media outputs manages to maintain a consistent position on the political spectrum without direct interference if not from him then from someone high up.

As evinced by the press in our own country, left-wing papers tends to sell less well than right-wing ones. You could argue about why this is the case, but I don't think the fact of it is in dispute. Television is more balanced, mostly because of Ofcom regulations, but if left to its own devices I'd wager we'd see the same swing on the box.

Murdoch may be right-wing, but his papers are right-wing because it sells, not because of his own opinions. That is what Davies' book argues, and if he'd seen evidence that the bias was ideological chances are he would have emphasised it. But it's not, it's about money.

&gt; (Looked at it on Wiki, apparantely the term refers to classical liberalism which today is more conservative than liberal, because apparantely those lines weren't blurry enough already.)

As an aside, you've got this the wrong way round. Liberalism has historically referred to laissez-faire governments, what you've referred to as classical liberals. The use of the word liberal to describe soft socialism is the corrupt version, and probably a better name for them would be social egalitarians.

true,Lluxx,null,null,"I'll be presumptuous and give you a quick summary of British unis and how people see them, because I remember how difficult this stuff was when I had to learn and I was born and raised in Britain.

Disclaimer: some people will argue that all this prestige is based on snobbishness and tradition rather than quality. How true this is is debateable, and there's certainly a lot of unnecessary snobbery going around.

Top place is, of course, Oxford and Cambridge, but always check to see if they're the best for your specific course rather than assume it. They have the reputation, but they're not the best for everything and employers know that. 

After that you have the redbrick and other prestigious universities. Universities of Birmingham, Bristol, Edinburgh, UCL (which includes a number of different colleges), Manchester, Southampton, off the top of my head, but there are more. 

There's also the Russell Group which is a group of top research-based universities who receive a load of funding from the government because, well, they're the top. [Here](http://www.russellgroup.ac.uk/our-universities/) is a full list of them. All of them are good places to go to, but worth checking out for your course individually.

Now there's the modern universities. Not massively prestigious like the old ones, but nothing to sniff at either. Universities of Bath, York, Sussex, etc are included here. They'll often be very good at a couple of courses (for example, Loughbourough is the place to be for sports and I imagine very difficult to get into for this course), so keep an eye out for any with a reputation for the course you like. Like I said, these tend to be pretty respectable. 

Now there's the ex-polys. They used to be polytechnic colleges until they were all given university status to stop people being snobby about them (as you can see, it hasn't worked much). University of West England, Cardiff Metropolitan, Sheffield Hallam, etc, are part of this. Despite the snobbery, they aren't necessarily terrible at everything so it's always worth checking league tables and looking at the course you want to do specifically to find out if it's for you. Greenwich is also part of it, but tends to do particularly bad on league tables. 

[Here](http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?s=Business+%26+Management+Studies) is the Independent's league table for business (I'm assuming it's business you want to do, right?) so you can get a feel. As you can see, the informal pecking order I've described above doesn't always reflect onto league tables. 

Pick five universities you like and apply to all of them. I'm not going to say don't go to Greenwich, but I'd definitely advise you to consider other options before setting your heart on it!

Ultimately they might see that having a more 'premium' agency, will result in a wealthier tenant.  That isn't to say I've not heard stories of very expensive places being trashed, but on the whole it happens a lot less than it does to cheaper places.

The problem is the whole estate agent business in the UK strikes me as just being strangely wrong.  Why on earth would I pay a flat 2% if I'm selling my house?   Say it goes for £300k, they get £6k.  But if they sell it for £50k less than it's market value, at £250k it should be fairly easy to shift, they still get £5k.  I've lost £49k.  But for the estate agents business, it's a lot quicker and easier to turn around all these properties at the quickest sale price they can.

Before when I was looking to move, I had a couple of agents value my place, when talking about the commission it was amazing how they reacted.  I offered effectively 33% of every £ they got above £300k.  Very interesting to see which agencies had flexibility.  Incredibly interesting to see how many agencies simply replied *oh that's not how things are done* as if there was some immutable business standard.

&gt;The evidence suggests that while the cost of living crisis has hurt every socio-economic group, it has been a disaster for the poorest households. The proportion of income that the poorest households spend on necessities rose by nine percentage points between 2003 and 2012, in the biggest rise endured by any economic group.

&gt;According to a cross-party inquiry led by Labour MP Frank Field, the disproportionately large increase seen in the poorest households is due entirely to rising housing and fuel costs – the proportion of income spent on food is the same as a decade ago.

So apparently we've this 'crisis' which is hurting every socio economic group.  But then apparently it's driven by fuel and housing costs rising.  Which if the latter, would benefit certain economic groups.

I've certainly not felt any kind of crisis, so fuel prices have gone up a bit, well, I never use the car for anything under 10 miles, we've had such a mild winter I didn't have the heating on much at all.  Food prices have increased a bit, but not that much.

But yes, immediately we're told that there is some crisis going on.

We've a rising in food bank use.

Some universities won't accept a BTEC, and at others it will vary between courses, so I'd advise you to do some research now to make sure you can get onto the course of your choice, at the university of your choice, with the qualifications you're taking.

Another big reason why people don't give away a lot of their money, is how would you actually spend it?  The Bill and Melinda Gates foundation is doing some great work, and it's very hard to not have the upmost respect for them.  But it is difficult.

They don't want to invest money in things that don't really make any difference, the issues in say Africa come not from a lack of money, money has poored into those areas over the last few decades, but from systemic corruption and poor management.

That's why when you look at someone like Bill Gates, who I honestly believe is wanting nothing more than to try and make the world a better place at the moment, he is funding things he believes in, these things are not expensive, and the foundation will be able to keep on going for many years at it's present rate.

The fact a lot of these billionares have the money tied up in companies that are trying to make or do things, which will create jobs if there is a demand for the services complicates things too.

I am a local, and generally if the weather is nice hit up the beach, pick a bar (they are all alright on the front, my fave is the Brighton Music hall as they have live music whenever the sun shines in the summer)! Also checking out the pier can be super fun! 

In the evening pick a nice pub for some grub if that's your thing, the locals are friendly and if you're the sort who likes talking to people you'll probably end up having a chat with someone, if not just soak up the atmosphere! 

The brighton festival is on right now, so if you want to do events pick up a fringe magazine, or head over the website http://www.brightonfringe.org/ buy yourself some tickets and have some fun! 

It's had to suggest places because I don't really know what you like, but yeah, there is something for everyone here in Brighton, so just wander around until you see something you like!

I think you have a bit of a chip on your shoulders, no where in the video did it state that someone who criticises Islam was a racist or a bigot. The whole point of the video is to take a satirical and mocking approach towards the fanatical EDL types who believe the UK will one day be an Islamic caliphate, where we all be forced to wear Islamic clothing and speak Arabic. The video wasn't trying to mock people who are critical of Islam.

I don't think that'd help, unless you live pretty much on top of the exchange. The reason for taking fibre to the cabinets is that then you've got just 100m of copper and can push a lot down it. Speeds drop off quickly as you get further away though.

Taking a couple of graphs, if you've got ADSL2+ (I'm pretty sure you will have) then this graph: http://www.broadbandspeedchecker.co.uk/guides/adsl_and_distance.aspx suggests you're about 2.5km from the exchange.

I've been going to many different gyms for the past five or so years, and while I've seen some improvement here and there, I think the confidence issue is a big thing. 

I never really got serious about making progress until this year. Even despite the years I'd put in, my knowledge and experience was still pretty basic. I had developed shoulders and calf's, and could lose weight when I chose to. 

In January this year I could only bench around 30kg too. I didn't know this before, as I'd never had the confidence to use the weights area much. I stuck to a couple resistance machines and a lot of cardio. 

I got my knowledge and confidence by signing up with a friend of mine. He's experienced it all: from overweight, to training himself thin and underweight, to training muscles and strength. He knows the food, the exercise, the routine and the machines. Imparting all this knowledge to me has been great, but the greatest benefit he gave me was confidence. 

He knew, on our first workout together, that I wouldn't even be able to compete with his numbers. But he encouraged me not to even try. He said to start, I should just do the same exercises and routines, but at my at a weight and resistance I'd find comfortable. 

It was a couple of gruelling weeks, but we found out what I was capable of, and how I could grow it from there. He brought enough confidence to the table for both of us, so I gave it my all. For what he gave me, the least I could do was give it a can do attitude and meet all challenges with a shit load of enthusiasm.

As I said, this is the first time I've really taken gym work seriously. It gets easier, you get stronger and you get more confidence. 

The hardest part for me was asking him. I was embarrassed. People assumed because I was a regular gym goer, that I knew what I was doing. In reality I was clueless. 

I'm currently benching 80kg on a good day. It's progress, and I'm pleased with it. 

TL;DR - For me, it wasn't about which gym, but about who you can train with and how you approach it. Get a buddy and some motivation. Push each other. It's a hell of an inspiration.",0,1400420256,null,0,false,0,chkz1th,t3_25sgea,t1_chkz1th,t3_25sgea,null,1433848418,1,false,nottingham,t5_2qmbu,1

And how do they intend to destroy them? How do Jehovahs Witnesses want to fight gay marriage? Do they want to do it via legal means, or with weapons and murder?

Thank you for illuminating the mentality of those who think its necessary to yell FIRE FIRE in the cinema to point out the people still smoking after all these years, but **its really not helping**.

Its the corruption of poorly regulated schools, to a religion with strong ties to the middle east and foreign cultures, this can only be fought with defending western ideals through law, and to do so with equal treatment of all religions and an **absolute minimum of hyperbole**.

Anything less will be ineffective and waste everyones time in ensuring the smooth evolution of british society.

Please channel your enthusiasm for preserving the progressive society we're building, by not being regressive towards the regressive, conservative religious people are not terrorists, when they want to fight with weapons or calling for violence or other such lawlessness, they fall under that banner, not until.

true,ImThe10Doct0r,tennant,Tennant,"Good list. I almost agree with it. I however, do not agree with what you said about Clara. She's a great companion, and on my list she's either 1 or 2 for me. And I'll tell you why.

First off, she's very clever, as shown in Dalek Asylum, The Snowmen, but especially in Bells of Saint John. And I'm not talking about the fact she suddenly got computer skills, I'm talking about how she found out where the bad guy is. By using the fact that everyone is connected through social media and that a lot of people post everything, including where they work. Now that's pretty smart. She's also eager to go on an adventure and go to see places, which gives her a perfect reason to go off with the Doctor. But, she's also cautious and carefull because she doesn't go running off with him instantly because she was unsure of the Doctor's weird nature. And because she's loyal and doesn't just walk out on the people she cares about. For the first time, a companion has made the Doctor wait for an answer. She's also very caring and a good listener, as shown by the fact she's a nanny and eventually a school teacher. Also when she helped the little girl from The Rings of Akhaten. She's also very selfless, giving up 2 things very precious to her, her mother's ring and the leaf, to help save the being on the Ringsof Akhaten from the evil sun god thing. Also, stepping into the Doctor's time stream, risking death, just to save him over and over again. She's also somewhat obedient, like in Cold War when the Doctor told her not to wander off, she didn't (a trait every companion needs, because that how they always get themselves into trouble). She also has the ability to be a good leader, as shown in Nightmare in Silver when the Doctor put her in charge. She's also incredibly brave. Just watch any episodes in series 7b, and you can she that she's brave even when she's terrified. Most notable is when she faces Grand Marshal Skaldak in Cold War. She's also very observant, like in Hide when she's the only one that realizes that the ""ghost"" is always in the same position, or that the guy and the girl are obviously attracted to each other. Another example is when she's the only one that notices that a chimney on a factory has no smoke. She's also pretty humble, when declining the marriage proposal from the emperor, saying that she just wants to see the universe, not own it. She also saw the truly good man the Doctor is even when he himself didn't see it. She believed in him. And she refused to believe that the Doctor, any version of him (including the Warrior) could destroy his home planet, persuading him/them to find another option. She believes and trusts in the Doctor. And despite going on adventures with him, she had yet to be his companion full time. She instead decides to go back home after each adventure, to continue to have a life outside of the Doctor, refusing to just walk out on everyone. She's also pretty relatable, as she lost a parent in her teenage years (I can definitely relate to that, as I had just lost my dad just before series 7 started). And even though it doesn't show it on screen, she definitely had to go through trying to deal with losing a parent that early in life, which makes her a deeper character. 

So, she may not be insecure about herself like Donna was, but Clara is a deeper and more interesting character than you give her credit for. And sure, she hasn't had much character development (if any), but she's only had half a season. Give her time. And now that the ""impossible girl"" story arc is over with, I think that she'll be even more interesting.

It took him about a minute or so (an eternity in radio time) for him to bumble through that simple point, then he was about to go on to talking about waiting for a bus, when they finally cut him off. They clarify his point then try and move the conversation on and let him back in. And he replies, ""Well, if I could just finishing making the point I was trying to make!

I can see with a quick google some people have already raised historical motions supporting nuclear power (apparently haven't been passed though).

&gt;I wasn't referring to the economy but the idea that we need more people in the workforce to care for the aging population. And when those people get old, we'll need more people to care for them...

As long as any such increase is below trend rate of growth, that isn't a problem. 

&gt; The government is responsible for the UK border force and should be responsible for who and who isn't allowed into the country. This is one of the primary purposes of government. 

I'm talking about immigration, not border control. 

&gt;The fact most voters base their decision on the economy or tribal loyalty shouldn't hide the fact that if the overwhelming majority of the country want something, the politicians should act upon it. Labour made no mention in their 1997 manifesto that they would allow the numbers to hugely increase- in fact they hinted the opposite. Complete deception. 

You're completely missing the point, or else you're being deliberately obtuse. Net immigration is the result of factors that governments don't control. New Labour fixed the economy and brought the UK out of recession, so of course net migration increased - would it have been better if they hadn't? 

&gt;Immigration is currently running at 532,000 a year, 212,000 net. Either you regard 212,000 people a year (a city the size of Norwich added to the population each year) as high or not. 

In a country the size of the UK? No, I don't. 

&gt;Are you saying that literally none of the millions of unemployed people in the UK are able to do these ""skilled"" jobs? Do you think it's better for the nation to train up unemployed young people to do the jobs or simply import workers from abroad? No-one serious is suggesting stopping ALL skill migration, but the idea that there are 212,000 jobs that NO British person could possibly do is laughable. 

How on earth would you cut net migration to 30,000 without eliminating skilled migration? Improving the education system is a worthy goal, but it will take years and in any case is solving a completely different problem; British workers need the jobs that skilled migrants create. Autarky in human capital is as self-defeating as any other kind. 

&gt;There must be a hell of a lot of racists in the UK then, myself included. Always nice to be told that I dislike people on the basis of their skin because I am concerned about high immigration. 

I've explained why I think that raising immigration as a spectre is a tactic unsupported by rational argument, which leaves only appeal to emotion - which must inevitably be racist in sentiment.

It was a real thing in times of higher wage inflation: after five years you'd have enough equity in your starter hovel, and a a much higher salary, everything was set.  Now you'd have the equity, but an identical salary that wouldn't be able to borrow any more; and you'd need the equity you already have to buy anything a similar size.

The relationship between rents and mortgage repayments is an interesting one.  If the housing market were completely stable (i.e. growing at an economically sustainable rate), then renting ought to be more expensive, after all if it isn't (and it's not - by quite a significant margin in some areas) then what is the landlord getting out of it?  The only reason people would rent in such circumstances would be in the example of recent graduates with uncertain career paths etc.

You could argue that renting is cheaper than buying is proof that there is a bubble, for the reason I gave above.  If the property shortage was equally distributed between wannabe buyers and wannabe renters then there ought to be a small premium to rent.  The fact that there isn't, is almost certainly down to speculators in the form of buy-to-let landlords.

1.  Interest rate rises are the obvious one.  Each rise would make property slightly more unaffordable.

2.  A decline in the London financial sector.  There's an outside risk of a new financial crisis, the accountability and behaviour of investment banks and hedge funds are still in doubt.  The 2008 bail-out saved it the last time, but there's only so many times we'd be able to do that sort of thing.

3.  A change in UK politics making it less attractive to outside money.  External investors are less emotionally attached to UK property than UK middle-classes are; the second something better comes along, whoosh.

Then towards the end of the season we started to see some teams kick the pieces out of him. We've seen it this year too. Other teams know (or think they know) that he is focus for our creativity and go at him. Hard. After his initial few games in Jan and Feb he cooled off for this reason I think. 

Brendan clearly has a vision for the boy, as he's clearly reacted to how he is training him. This year Coutinho's shown the work rate, mental and physical toughness, tackling needed to toughen him up and adjust to the Premier League game. Then Coutinho started to add shooting to his repertoire (though this needs to improve). He's being turned into an attack building CM; not a CAM that loses his position and concedes midfield or an inside forward/winger that doesn't add goals and cannot beat players using pace. 


I think we will see a much improved season from him next year. That's not to say that he's gotten worse over the season, just improved in attributes we didn't know him for. If he manages to combine the aspects of both seasons together, I don't think the league will know what hit them.

* It is a corporation, the Scott Trust ceased being an obvious tax haven and became [Scott Trust **Limited** in 2008](http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/the-scott-trust/). Corporations are designed like a monarchy, an iconic brand figurehead, under which there is a ruling class and hierarchy of increasingly powerless workers who don't own the value they produce.

IP is the foundation of the intellectual rentier class and capitalism. It's also why I say the Guardian is pro-privatisation in this case information via copyright—a ring-fencing or ""Enclosure"" of the intellectual Commons.

* It's a corporation in name, what's your point? They are not a communist paper, they are a left-wing paper that supports social democracy. They are also not run by shareholders but by a trust that changed its structure for legal purposes. 

* A successful business also needs a successful manager, these managers actually want paying. Sure in you socilaist utopian dream world people would work for free but here in the real world people want to paid for working so they can buy things like food and clothing.

* And yet they released information about a massive surveillance operation, about spying on German allies and how the NSA and GCHQ attempted to break SSL. They are all huge stories that the ""powerful"" would probably not want released. Your source is hilarious by the way, it reads like a conspiracy nut has read a thesaurus.

true,NotBaldwin,somerset,West Country,"That sounds like some exceptionally terrible cold reading. That's a large part of what appearing to be psychic is though; cold reading. There may be a few people that delude themselves into thinking that what they're doing is a psychic reading, but they're simply cold-reading a member of the public that usually desperately wants to believe that the psychic is genuine. 

A friend gave an amazing example of Derren Brown, who did a few shows on a cruise him and his parents went on when he was a bit younger. Derren Brown I find all the more impressive because he readily touts every part of his act as either psychological manipulation, outside trickery, or sleight of hand.

In one of his shows he straight up said to a member of the audience that this person desperately wanted to be a singer, and lo-and-behold he was right. The thing was though, that this aspiring singer had performed on the ship karaoke several times and had completely sung his bollocks off, and being on the cruise ship, Derren Brown was clearly aware of this.

I really hate those that claim to be psychic and offer readings of the dead because its such a morally corrupt lie. Cold-reading on its own is an incredibly impressive technique that should be a performing skill in its own right. Bad practitioners such as Sally shouldn't be able to lean on the crutch of having people believe in psychic powers to support her fraudulent business and poor stage performance.

Silence.

More silence.

""No.""

""Well he's been sick in the past few years, hasn't he?""

""No.""

""Not seriously, like. Has he been bedridden, had the 'flu, that sort of thing?""

""No, he's the healthiest bloke I know, hasn't even had a cold since I met him.""

""Hmm, perhaps it's not Peter then. P... P... Anyone else have a connection with P?""
