Behind every expanding industry is capital used to grow, hire, and invest, and that capital is transferred and facilitated by the financial services industry in particular, which of course includes various different subsectors.  

Britain has, for centuries now, not only handled that service for our own country, but has provided financial services to large parts of the rest of the world at a cost, bringing in tax revenue and employing British people.  The idea of some kind of objective 'productivity' as Marx loves is a fantasy- digging ditches in the sand all day is labour, but it isn't 'productive' or indeed valuable to society, and thus serves no purpose.   Financial Services is productive because not only does it, in facilitating capital movement, advance society, commerce and industry in general, but it also creates a service/product that can be sold in other countries at a profit, providing revenue which can be taxed and put to work supporting the British economy in other ways.

- Don't use a car, they are useless in Uni 7 just a an expense you'll ill afford. Get a 2nd hand bike &amp; backpack and do your shopping with those.
- Get a good small laptop in fresher's week or before you go (like a Macbook Air) that'll last you over the three years. Buying a good laptop is frugal as you have to replace it less, and it won't lose your work etc. Seriously, the number of people I knew that bought two shitty Dell laptops in the 3 years they were at Uni, ended up paying more than just one decent laptop.
- No you can't do proper work on an iPad, don't even try!
- It's already been mentioned here... but after rent, food will probably be the biggest expense. Buy in bulk, and ask someone that has a car (there's always one!) to do a run to Lidl every 6 months or so to stock up on orange juice, noodles, pasta, rice, lentils, tinned toms etc.
- The best thing money-wise I did with food was to share with someone else, cook and share the same meals together - it ended up being about 40% less per week on food, as you can make lunch in leftovers, and bulk rice, pasta etc costs pennies extra for another portion.
- The joining fees for societies and clubs are worth it, go and socialise with your kin, you'll never regret being too busy in the evenings (especially in your first year where marks don't mean a thing). 
- Find the local Christian Student's Union society, they always have free food &amp; drink social events, especially in freshers. Go along talk about god &amp; eat free food.
- Avoid corner shops and convenience stores, stick to the big supermarkets and Indian/Asian supermarkets. Markets *can* be good too, but you need to know the value of something first (i.e. roughly how much 6 oranges would normally cost)
- Drink before you go out, and then go find the cheap student places. Tbh, i didn't follow the last part much, as I like good beer and not cheap vodka, but hey.
- Instead of going out to restaurants to eat, get a cheap pizza from asda and pimp it with bought nice ingredients, like extra pepperoni, more cheese etc - SO much cheaper
- Keep a little bit of money back for the start of the term &amp; year, as books will be the biggest expense at the start.
- DON'T GET A CREDIT CARD. Seriously, just don't. Unless you have a salaried job, they are not a wise plan imo

&gt;In a shocking twist to the Patel murder enquiry, an inquest has returned a report that they consider thoughts - sometimes called ""brain ideas"" - to be the proximate cause of death. 

&gt;The coroner reported on Thursday that the brain ideas which have been detected in the mind of young Kunta Patel, ""significantly affected her behaviour"" in a way which ""could not have been possible without the presence of a brain mind in her head"". 

&gt;This news will deliver a crushing blow to pro-think activists, as MPs have begun discussing a motion to ban thought completely in response to concerns about psychoholism and brain binging. 

&gt;Douglas Carswell MP commented from his home this evening, saying ""I personally have been shown evidence, damning evidence, that brain thinks have been involved in the overwhelming majority of recent violent and nonviolent crimes.

The other might be if you are putting too much pressure through the bars and shifting them about, stay as loose as possible on the bars. Try and find somewhere quiet and practice, you'll need to for the Mod 1 anyway. Sometimes it can help to apply a tiny bit of back break while riding slow. With practice you should be able to go at walking pace without wobbling.

How would you even know if he's good enough? You can't even tell me what good enough is, let alone give me enough information on Tonev's performances and ability to convince me.

I mean, a quick check of stats and I can tell you now that Tonev gave the ball away once every two appearances for Villa, misplaced only two passes per appearance (of an average of around eight or nine), only made roughly two crosses per appearance and only took three shots every two appearances. Highlighting his inaccuracy or poor ball retention over such small samples of data doesn't hold enough statistical significance to constitute a trend or make it useful in an even remotely reliable appraisal of his current ability, let alone potential.

But hey, if you want to evaluate him as ""not good enough"" from that sample of data, that's cool. But I can also say that Tonev gave the ball away as often as Westwood, and only FOUR first team players were more accurate with their passing, for example.

If you insist on evaluating him from this small sample of data, you might want to suggest we sell Gabby to a Championship team too, though... since in the same season, he often played a similar role and had a lower pass accuracy, similar cross accuracy, took about as many shots per game (with just four goals from thirty appearances) and gave the ball away nearly twice as often. The only noticeable superiority is in the number of passes on average in an appearance... where Gabby averages almost double... however, I can't calculate passes per minute on the pitch with available data right now (which I suspect would be a much closer figure, given that Tonev made 11 of his 17 appearances from the bench, compared to one of 30 for Gabby). Let's also not forget that Agbonlahor is three years older, too... so he's ***obviously*** not going to improve. Don't even get me started on comparisons with Gabby at age 24. Or roughly half the rest of the team, in fact. It ain't good reading.

If he doesn't make the grade, that's cool. But don't write him off before he's even made 20 appearances for the club, ffs. It makes no sense at all to label him inadequate off a handful of appearances and a few missed shots, especially when you have no idea what happens on the training ground.

No - that's one woman who was an ex-nazi over 20 years ago and regretted it deeply. 20 years ago things were really different in the UK.

The second example I'll give you. But you'll need more than ONE example to build a case. There's 10's of thousands of Labour councillors, MP's and members. There's a fraction of that in UKIP. For every Ukip who comes out and says something bizarrely racist you need 20 Labour councillors to do the same in order for there to be a comparison.

&gt; Are the libdems terrorists for having a candidate that detonated bombs in his own constituency?

If one person counts as the whole party then yes - but lets be serious. No.

Let's put this on the table:

Ukip is part of the group Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD). The group includes representatives of the Danish People’s Party, the True Finns Party, the Dutch SGP and the infamous Italian Lega Nord – all of them far-right. Farage is co-President along with a neo-nazi guy who is an Anders Brevik fan. MEP Nikki Sinclaire, however, was expelled from Ukip for refusing to take part in the EFD because of their “extreme views”.

Ukip is the only UK party to explicitly ban BNP members from joining - why, because so many of them tried to join.

Farage asked his MEP's to oppose the vote that would pull funding from far-right parties.

Ukip's Immigration guide said it wanted to ""end support for multiculturalism and promote one, common British culture"".

Farage sent his Deputy Paul Nuttall to Bulgaria  to diffuse statements he's said about Bulgarians and was quoted as saying “Brits fear all immigrants, regardless of where they would come from.” Farage later said of immigrants “You’re welcome to come here and to have your children here… but if you’re coming here to take us over, you’re not welcome.”",0,1411407832,null,0,false,0,ckph6f1,t3_2h4o6j,t1_ckph6f1,t1_ckpg64l,null,1426876160,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

It could be any issue, the idea is that sociologically conservatism has a belief in positive functionalism e.g. 'Society exists the way it does, because this is the way it has historically worked.' so even institutions people clamour to reform such as the CoE relationship to parliament, or the Lords, they would argue they have historically served a purpose and have made the country successful.

So thats why conservatism generally supports hierarchial power structures and also why there is inertia on social policies. As someone else said ""if it isnt broke, dont fix it"" or equally ""it is the way it is, because that's how it works best"".

Tories by the way are a political party and aren't necessarily exactly the same as the political ideology of conservatism. For example the sweeping education changes we have had these last four years are not very 'conservative' policies, more traditionalist - e.g. rejecting evidence / consensus, going off ""enlightened leadership"" instead, dramatic changes rather than small incremental etc.",0,1411408123,null,0,false,0,ckphc83,t3_2h4o6j,t1_ckphc83,t1_ckpfwe6,null,1426876085,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

On the internet, you can choose where you participate and where you listen. This is the crucial point of what reddit calls a ""Circlejerk"" but elsewhere is known as an ""Echo Chamber"".

Because of the way Reddit functions, this effect is amplified to ridiculous levels. A tiny difference in the number of supporters (about 60% to 40%) will result in the smaller side being crushed and many of them giving up after being buried under downvotes or, more crucially, ignored. Due to the way the upvote system works, only content which is upvoted rapidly after it's posted gets widespread viewing. Content that goes against the majority, even if it still has a large amount of supporters, will simply be drowned out by the far more successful majority-backing content. This is what leads to reddit being a circlejerk-infested website.

Early on, /r/unitedkingdom became dominated by people who hate the conservatives, perhaps a 60% to 40% ratio. As time progressed, the 40% got drowned out and slowly gave up. They either leave the subreddit entirely, ignore related discussions, or hide their viewpoint.

I suspect that the difference between us lies in how we treat individual Muslims. There are a lot of Muslims, and when I say a lot I mean an overwhelming majority, who are ordinary decent people who love the people in their families and treat them well whether they are men or women.

These people will be influenced by the general attitudes of the non-Muslim people around them, so where they encounter normal people treating them the same way as they would everyone else they'll respond in kind, the attitudes will soften.

When people treat them unkindly because of their religion the attitudes harden. To attack every Muslim for the actions of the extremists plays into those extremists hands. It negates the possibility of the creation of a distinct British strand of Islam which is more cosmopolitan and able to accommodate different life choices.

There are problems within the British Muslim communities (I don't think it is correct to talk of a single British Muslim community) and some of these problems have some fairly horrific consequences. The Rotherham thing, to my mind was a policing failure. The facts had been placed before them and they decided to cover it up.

Here's another example for Labour.

http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-London/2014/09/22/Labour-cant-cry-ukip-racism-in-heywood-by-election-heres-why

&gt;The local Labour Party have already begun to demonise UKIP with untruths about the party's policy on taxation, the NHS, and more. But the 'raaaaccccissssttt' narrative will look desperate and hypocritical given McInnes's close working relationship with Maxfield. The former BNP man was welcomed with open arms into the local Labour Party – a cynical move predicated on the strong BNP vote in the area in 2005 and 2010. According to one source, the thought process was so deeply entrenched that Labour even made Maxfield the Mayor of Darwen in an attempt to whitewash (pun intended) his past.

&gt;The Nope Not Hope website states: 

&gt;Maxfield had a long history with the BNP. He was appointed local organiser by no less a person than then BNP leader Nick Griffin back in 2004 when he was described by his predecessor as being one of the 'drug dealers and football hooligans' who made up the local branch of the BNP. 

&gt;He didn't defect straight to Labour though - first he joined the white supremacist 'England First Party'. Of course, had he been a member of UKIP, we'd have read about all this on the front page[s] of the Mirror and the Guardian, and Hope not Hate and [Unite Against Fascism] would have been picketing his house. 

&gt;But, since he eventually joined Labour, that's alright then. As a fellow Labour councillor said when he was made cabinet member for culture, ""To be fair to Trevor, he’s quite a good bloke. I think his BNP stuff is in the past"". Not that far in the past, as he is pictured at a 'Heritage &amp; Destiny' meeting in Bradford in 2006 with various other luminaries of the far right, including Eddy Morrison and Dave Smith. 

&gt;[It is] a strange world indeed where Maxfield is not just accepted but promoted within the Labour Party despite his far right links, while he would not even qualify for membership of UKIP because of his past associations.

West Brom held their defensive shape well, but it was hard to tell if that was down to them being well-organized, or if we were not finding ways to disrupt that organization.

It appeared, then, to be fundamentally down to poor individual performances on our part, and probably equally some very strong performances on their part (Lescott). I always hesitate to blame individuals when the team as a whole seems to be operating inefficiently or ineffectively, but looking again I think it's the best explanation. Chiriches was a mess. Dembele was slow. Adebayor was lazy.

Trust that Jose knows this, bc you wouldn't see Bane on the pitch as much if he didn't.

false,[deleted],null,null,"At the heart of, or at least heavily implied by, the LTV and indeed Marxism in general is the idea that all labour has intrinsic value.  As soon as you start tacking things onto that like ""socially necessary"" or ""economically viable"" you start changing the rules to mean absolutely anything, because anything can be justified as 'socially necessary'.

As it happens I would *strongly* argue that the financial sector is 'socially necessary', because it manages the efficient allocation of capital and wealth to productive enterprise, which in turn advances the economy and society at large by creating and building new economic units/widgets/services, funding innovation, and encouraging productivity.  

""Socially necessary"" work is a vague, pointless term because it could mean anything.  Technically anything beyond basic shelter and food is not 'necessary' for the homo sapien to survive, but most people don't wish to live the life of a caveman.   On the other hand you could call something like Facebook socially important, because it provides a service people use and enjoy, and indeed find useful.  Financial Services too, help allocate economic resources and provide capital to those who require it so that economic units that people do require, like healthcare organisations and food companies, can expand and provide a better service to more people.

I use these examples as where people ignore the important components, because they do not appreciate their value.  One piece of foam padding misplaced down a space shuttle.

Try a slow ride later when the road is quiet, keep your head up and look where you want to go, maintain a loose grasp on the bars, grip tightly onto the tank with your legs. The wobbles will go.

In my interview (for maths) they didn't ask anything aside from getting me to actually do maths, but that will vary a lot between subjects and between colleges.

During the admissions process you can bring up extenuating circumstances - and having missed schooling due to illness would definitely be something to bring up here. I believe there is a form that your school can send in with your application (for things they will look at formally with your application, they want something from your teachers or a medical professional, although I believe they also ask you in the SAQ about any disruptions).

As for dealing with a serious health condition, obviously it can depend a lot on what it is, and I assume you don't want to go into detail on a public forum. If you tick the box on your UCAS form saying that you have a disability/health condition, they will pass this on and the disability resource centre (DRC) will get in touch during the application process. You can also contact them at any point, even as a prospective applicant, with and queries you have, and it is worth at least looking at their website. They're likely to have the best information about practicalities and similar when it comes to applying or living in cambridge. They might also be able to help with things like getting disabled students allowance (whether or not you consider yourself to have a disability, this covers extra things needed due to a long term health condition) which might get you, for example, a recording device to record lectures and play back later.

If you do end up here, I do recommend talking to your tutor near the start of your first term. They will be able to help with, for example, having a word with your DoS/supervisors on your behalf if work will be late due to illness, arranging special conditions for exams if you need them, making sure you get suitable accomodation for subsequent years if you need anything in particular. They do quite a lot, and they are generally the people who are supposed to be on your side.

You wouldn't be the only one dealing with a health condition at university by any means, although I obviously have no idea if you'd be the only one with your specific condition. I would be wary of cambridge if you have reason to think you'll be continuing being unable to work for lots of every term - once you get more than a small amount behind, it can be very hard to catch up - but if you think that most of the time during term you'll be able to manage lectures and supervision work, then you'll be alright (and remember, terms are relatively short and holidays relatively long). Generally if ask for it in the right places (usually your tutor), the university will be as accomodating as they can feasibly be to get you on the level with other students.

First you make the assumption that the things you listed were a) not in the interest of the public and b) opposed by everyone. This is wrong. There is at least an argument to be made for them (I support most of them - undecided on foundation hospitals) and the idea that there is significant public opposition is just the result of the internet echo chamber. In reality most people don't care or know enough to be well informed. This was particularly the case with the tuition fees issue. 

Second, backbench MPs are often zealous at protecting their constituent's interests. Why else do you think HS2 has had such opposition from Tories? It runs through Tory constituencies. The problem largely lies with MPs in government who, almost by design, have to ignore constituents. That can be solved through separating the legislature from the executive. FPTP doesn't impact that at all.

Finally, anything that affects the country as a whole will force MPs to decide how they feel they need to proceed. To what extent should any MP protect his or her constituency from something that is beneficial to the country as a whole. The electorate is largely sensible and can tell when a good decision is made for the benefit of the country as a whole (well - sometimes) but they can also punish MPs who refuse to properly defend their interests. 

Interestingly, the MPs who most need votes (in marginals) are least likely to be in government (because if they were tipped for it they would have been given a safer seat) so either way - backbench MPs will often fight tooth and nail for their constituents.

Where are you getting this from?  I refute it entirely until you can prove it.

I don't honestly see LTV as particularly relevant to my initial comment, but since you've decided to raise some of the old canards that people who haven't read Capital (or didn't understand it) generally use to attack the concept, I'll make a couple of points.

The idea that labour is the source of value isn't original to Marx, it's a view which people have held for many centuries.  Of course, it's not the only source, the bounties of the planet are often valuable too, sometimes before any real labour is put into them.  Perhaps picking an apple requires a minimal amount of labour, but on any sensible analysis a wild growing low hanging apple comes pretty much for free.  So, it's been said that labour is the father of value and the earth is its mother, and I happily acknowledge that, as did Marx.  But the reason you guys don't like LTsV (despite your inventing most of them in the first place to attack landed aristocrats - Marx only took them to their logical conclusion) is because they lead to that inevitable conclusion that profits belong to labour and not to the owners of property.

false,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; the bounties of the planet are often valuable too, sometimes before any real labour is put into them. 

I think you have a very strange definition of 'value', which solely means how much other people (or beings) believe a certain object or service is worth.  No more and no less.  If there is no one who wishes to eat the apple, or see the beautiful glacier, then it is, as relates to humanity- valueless. 

As to the video, which you and I have definitely discussed here before, the argument it makes is not only put in a patronising and arrogant tone, but utterly ludicrous.  Not only does it get many things wrong about capitalism (value, especially in the case of goods not needed to survive, is the price people are willing to pay...), but it makes a lot of statements that it refuses or neglects to justify in its battle.  ""Social labour"" isn't defined beyond 'labour that goes into the makeup of society', which is just about the most vague, blandest pile of bullshit I have heard this week, and the intellectual equivalent of the word 'um' or perhaps 'stuff'.   

The narrator then goes on to say that Marx doesn't want to talk about 'usefulness', but rather 'value', before then saying that value doesn't mean anything, which seems more than a little strange.  (Of course Value is simply the product of Usefulness and Scarcity).  Then he goes onto spout some schtick about how Marx knew that we were different from beasts because we can see things in our mind's eye (?) and as such that justifies his arguments....somehow, which goes beyond even what Marx says in Kapital, at least as far as I remember.  Of course we are animals, and are affected by (in large part) the very same decision making processes that other animals are.  Disappointing for an atheist, this is quite a religious argument, assuming that humans are in some spiritual, magical way superior to other creatures.  

Regardless (lest I ramble), the video manages to say a whole lot of nothing at all, except that Marx only meant some kinds of Labour are valuable, but does nothing to expand on that claim, or indeed the highly *subjective* nature of 'socially useful labour', because that would essentially be proposing the STV, which can be used to justify Capitalism.

But with that being said, I don't think you would find this subreddit much likes Labour given that they were the ones holding the ball during the financial crisis and their handling was less than optimal. 

I also think that you would find that there's a lack of faith in the Lib Dems given how they've acted in the co-alition government.

The Tories absolutely bear the brunt of a lot of the dislike as they are currently in power and whatever is perceived as being wrong with the country is being ascribed to the Tories. I think that if Labour was in charge then very little would be markedly different.

UKIP, for me is the outlier here. My personal reasons for disliking UKIP is that I find that they monger fear around 'immigrants' and place a lot of blame on them for problems that have little/nothing to do with them. They distort facts and figures (not that other parties don't do this) to further an agenda which I find short sighted and often xenophobic, of not outright racist.

Farage is a more powerful speaker and charismatic speaker than any of his current opposition, but I find his views to be exceptionally distasteful.

It was deep in the depths of British political apathy, before the Ukip surge, before the Scottish independence excitement, it was a time when most British people couldn't have cared less about politics. Voter turnout was only 42%. The Coalition had just won an election based on being marginally less odious than Brown's Labour. And the Tories did the dirty on Clegg by spending big to campaign against it even though AV was the only reason he'd agreed to a coalition with them.

If you look at the map in the wikipedia article you can see that the areas that most strongly voted against AV in 2011 are now considered Ukip areas, or at least places where Ukip will have a solid chance so a referendum now, paired with charismatic campaigns by Farage and Natalie Bennett would probably see a very different result.",0,1411414663,null,0,false,0,ckpkvaa,t3_2h4fo9,t1_ckpkvaa,t3_2h4fo9,null,1426874384,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I don't think they want *themselves*, as in UKIP, getting more power, rather they want the business classes to have more power in Britain. Their policies are based around class and wealth as much as they are around foreigners. 

* EU and ECHR? Removing the UK from both would allow the government to take the piss with workers rights and poor people, doing things like unfairly slashing benefits and workers rights. It also fits their nationalistic angle of 'bloody foreigners, offering cooperation with us'. 

* Army? Nationalistic dick sizing 'my fleet is bigger than yours' posturing, less about turning that army on the people, or using it to go to war.

* Immigration? Don't you think it's strange that UKIP consistently complain about poor immigrants, mostly from Eastern Europe, but you rarely hear them complaining about rich migrants? You don't hear them complain about rich Arab, Chinese, Russian or American business people buying up property and businesses in the UK like wildfire, depriving the British population of their full benefits. You don't hear them complain about the TTIP risking to gift the sovereignty of this country to rich foreign businesses. You didn't hear them complain about the proposed  sale of AstraZenica to Pfizer, risking to research capabilities of the UK. The closest they get is when they're blaming the EU for those things, but they never actually argue on the principle of keeping money in Britain. 

 They are a pro-big-business party, and only have issues with foreigners when they're poor. Their anti-immigration policy is class based, and, at the highest levels of UKIP, shows little about race or nationality. 

 In the grassroots of the party, however, I think their is more of this anti-foreign vibe, but at the core of the party is the older ideologies (the same ideologies that suggested a flat tax rate) of supporting the highest bidder.

 That's also one of the reasons why they want to leave the EU, as that's one of the stumbling blocks to them selling out the UK to the massive foreign investors in America, China, Russia and the Middle East, and stopping them lining their own and their biggest donors pockets.

&gt; I've honestly not heard any UKIP spokesman talking that language recently. Can you find any examples?

I was watching the Scottish referendum on the BBC live the other day, and they had David Coburn on, UKIP MEP for Scotland. He said he was a libertarian, complained Scotland hated people who made money, said the SNP wanted everyone to eat haggis and drive ferraris, and generally complained about the left (and I was lead to believe the new UKIP MEPs were more moderate!). You definitely still have members in that party with those libertarian views.

Only Mikel and Oscar can really defend and none of your players are particularly big. If Bolton press, they will just knock our players off the ball. Mikel likes to play short easy passes when he comes into possession, which means either Oscar or Baker would have to drop back to get the ball. Bolton will chase down who ever drops back until they force an error (Exactly like the first half of the Swansea game).

If we are going to play Mikel we need a mid along side him who can get the ball out of the midfield or players ahead of him who can physically create their own space by holding off defenders. This doesn't have either of those.

Mikel will get pressed and give it back to our defenders. Oscar and Baker will get bullied. Schurrle's and Salah's pace will be wasted because we have no one to play through balls to them (basically, no quick counter attacks) and Remy will be invisible because no one can get him the ball.

Back line is good. I'd pick Courtois over Cech in goal because I think he could use a clean sheet. I like Remy to start up front. Your midfield is all wrong. ",0,1411415965,null,0,false,0,ckpllhc,t3_2h4mho,t1_ckpllhc,t3_2h4mho,null,1426874044,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

No more and no less. If there is no one who wishes to eat the apple, or see the beautiful glacier, then it is, as relates to humanity- valueless. 

Sure.  To explain here, I'm using the Marxian sense of value - which has two forms.  Use value (and the use value of an apple is to eat it and be temporarily sustained) and exchange value (which is what I can get for it by way of exchange).  These are clearly distinct, and non-Marxist economists are often guilty of conflating them.  This is why we've got into such a disastrous situation on housing...

&gt;value, especially in the case of goods not needed to survive, is the price people are willing to pay...

Again, you are conflating use value with exchange value, which is something critiques of Marx who haven't read him are wont to do.

It's defined pretty clearly.  Social labour is the production of socially-validated use values.

Vote!  Don't spoil your ballot.  Vote.

Young people are ignored by the political class because you don't vote.  The older age groups are pandered to because 70%+ of them turn out.  Until analysts for the major parties look at the numbers and see young people are too big a voting block to be ignored nothing will get any better.

Register yourself for a postal vote and you won't even need to leave the house.  Vote Green, or UKIP, or for an independent, or BNP.

Even if there is public demand for a sooner referendum, the British government would be well within its right to deny it, citing the recent referendum result and the damage caused by uncertainty when a referendum campaign is going on.

That's a considerable stretch of time before the chance of independence is likely to come again. But the problem with the SNP is that they are, at their core, a pro-independence party. It is not in their interest to work with the UK government or campaign for change that improves the way the country functions because it would detract from the argument for independence and possibly remove the need for it altogether if a compromise is reached that the Scottish public are happy with. I have not seen any evidence of the SNP doing anything to improve the current political situation, just complain about it, possibly exacerbate the problem and say ""independence is the only answer"". Right now, Scotland's position in the union has been assured for the near future. Scotland needs a party that will help work toward political reforms that will make the best of the situation for Scotland, but people are flocking to the party that has every incentive not to do that.

On Friday I was optimistic, I felt there would finally be a chance for people to work together, discuss issues and reconcile differences, so that we could build a better future for us all. I felt the yes campaign had taught us all a valuable lesson, that by engaging in politics and caring about issues we can bring about change. They very nearly brought about Scottish independence which, only a few years ago, seemed highly unlikely. If they had embraced any other cause with such energy and determination, such as political reform, they bloody well could have achieved it. I was hoping we would see people mending bridges that had become neglected broken over the years but instead it seems they're burning them down.

I'm really worried about Scotland's future, I fear there might be a strong divide in the population and the galvanisation of serious nationalism that will be difficult to control. Scotland's in a very difficult position, they're caught between parties that have neglected Scotland and parties that don't care about making the UK work for Scotland. I'm hoping that this is just a short term reaction in the immediate aftermath of the referendum and things will calm down once reforms kick in. If the governing parties are stupid enough not to deliver on what they've promised to the whole UK, not just Scotland, then that will guarantee Scotland will leave and it would serve them right.",0,1411416569,null,0,false,0,ckplx9l,t3_2h4sob,t1_ckplx9l,t3_2h4sob,null,1426873894,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

&gt;
&gt;The Valeyard claimed that he was created during a period when the thirteenth incarnation of the Doctor was experimenting with ways to break the twelve-regeneration limit imposed on Time Lords by Rassilon. The Valeyard was created as a Time Tot on a mud planet orbiting Etarho. At the age of four the Valeyard was found wandering the mud swamps of the planet by a group of scavengers, who gave him something to eat. When they learned what race the Valeyard belonged to, the scavengers sent him to Gallifrey.
&gt;The Time Lords examined the Valeyard's biodata and found that it was an exact match for that of the Doctor's. Knowing that this meant that the Valeyard was a temporal anomaly, they sent the Valeyard to a Shadow House. In the Shadow House the Valeyard met a Time Lord who had been damaged due to temporal interventions by his future self and therefore had his regeneration permanently stuck in a paradox. The man told the Valeyard to study the science of regeneration, in order to gain revenge on the Time Lords for what they had done to every member of the Shadow House.

I asked every time I called to discuss the problem that everything was okay to go ahead on the day of my actual move and they reassure me that it's fine.

Dangerous mentality. Bolton is still a team full of professional athletes and the championship is a very physical league. The difference isn't as big as you would think.

&gt;We should hopefully dominate possession and Bolton may not commit players forward and sit in their half, so we may get away with it.

We should dominate possession, but that in itself is a problem. No one in your chosen team is really good at breaking down a dug in defense. We're going to end up with 700 passes around the edge of the 18.

We either need physical players who can create space for themselves, or tricky players who can take people 1-on-1 and force the Bolton defense to step out of line. I think Schurrle is decent in that 1v1 area, but that isn't enough.

I'd prefer Willian on the ~~left~~ right and Ramires in the mid over Baker. That gives us a second player who can take people on and adds some speed to our midfield for the few times Bolton do push forward.",0,1411417764,null,0,1411426123,0,ckpmkh5,t3_2h4mho,t1_ckpmkh5,t1_ckpm1nn,null,1426873592,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

This constant contrast makes me feel as if she is slowly becoming more distant from the Doctor, so in an attempt to fight for her attention, he turns up at random moments. A similar thing happened between the 11th and Amy.

As for the darker side of the Doctor, it makes him more of a mysterious character, everything we thought we knew was just the tip of the ice berg. The question the Doctor asked Clara, ""Am I a good man?"" sent a shiver down my spine, since it is becoming obvious he is questioning everything he has done and wants to make amends with himself.

My only problem is that some of the stories have been weak. The latest two have been great, but the Robin Hood episode fell flat. I felt as if it tried to be funny, but wasn't, and felt a lot like 'Deep breath.'

In short, I am loving Capaldi as the new Doctor and the subplot of Clara. My only problem is the stories don't feel as solid as before. ",0,1411418205,null,0,false,0,ckpmt5x,t3_2h3tdz,t1_ckpmt5x,t3_2h3tdz,null,1426873479,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

With regards to Europe many people in their 50s+ feel that they were misled over the whole thing. My father and grandfather do nothing but moan about it whenever we talk politics. Many felt it was an economic union and nothing more. Hence why the desire for a referendum - or simply wanting out - is a big thing for them.

As for gay marriage, much like divorce in the 80s it is one of those things that is much an element of its time and the culture that came before. For our kids and their kids it'll be a nonissue. But that's how civil rights often are.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""two companies closely in bed with each other"" - Vodafone and O2 aren't that close outside of a very basic site sharing agreement (3 and T-Mobile, now EE, have a much closer agreement - including full share of their 3G radio network).

3 aren't doing badly at all. They're getting quite a lot of custom from the people who want cheap, good and unlimited. Free roaming in lots of countries (including the US) is a big draw too. Vodafone and EE are going for the insanely expensive approach (Vodafone using none of that money to upgrade its tin can network), and no idea what O2 is doing (apart from continuing to underinvest)

Mignolet did have poor positioning, Moreno was equally at fault but that doesn't mean he is forgiven. Via extensive microsoft paint footage and references I've compiled evidence of this.

**Ball lost**

Balotelli loses ball, no one is covering Gerrard who is further forward.

**Just before the pass**

Moreno is watching the ball, not Sahko meaning he loses him.

**Sahko receiving the ball:**
 
Moreno is too far forward, Sahko gets a run at goal and enough space to try the chip with very little pressure. 

West Ham's #31 offside, assuming Lovren should mark.

**Sahko chipping:**

Moreno doesn't close him down quick enough, Sahko gets a free shot at goal and via a mix of vision and a brilliant finish he scores due to Mignolet moving too far forward to cover the near post, if he is intending to stop a cross I feel that he is in a poor position to do so anyway. Meanwhile before the ball leaves Sahko Lovren loses #31 for West Ham.

**Sahko scores:**

No. 31 for West Ham the closest too a potential off the post tap in, Lovren and Mignolet helpless to do anything.

Your best bet would be to go straight to [Hannah Khan](https://www.facebook.com/vpsocsandcomms) (SU VP Societies and Communications) and ask her, she's really helpful and enthusiastic about this sort of thing.

The first thing to do is to find three other people to form the committee (1 president, 1 Vice President, 1 Participation officer, and 1 treasurer). I found that getting people you're already friends with involved is the best way of going about this since committee members can get on anothers nerves quite easily similar to doing group coursework.

Once you have those people sorted and a vague idea of what you want to do you have to fill out some paperwork including a budget and a society constitution (you can get any help you need with this from Hannah or one of the societies executives).

Third, representatives from all the societies meet three times a year to discuss and vote on a number of things including the formation of new societies where if you get a majority yes vote you get officially ratified as a new society. This part is the easiest so long as you actually turn up.

This is all I can really remember from starting a society, sorry I can't be of more help but so long as you go talk to the SU you'll get all the help you need from people who actually know what they're talking about.

Actually, it isn't defined clearly at all, which is why it remains on of the greatest criticised parts of Kapital and indeed Marxist thought in general.  Indeed it is so often refuted as a bunch of pointless sophistry with no basis in empirical fact (as are various connections between 'individual labour' and 'social labour' which Marx himself made and which are even vaguer than the definitions of value, that [even Marxists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Cohen) have begun to disassociate themselves from that specific aspect of Marxism.

&gt;Sure. To explain here, I'm using the Marxian sense of value - which has two forms. Use value (and the use value of an apple is to eat it and be temporarily sustained) and exchange value (which is what I can get for it by way of exchange). 

This is a common rebuttal that has been roundly criticised for its suggestion that exchange has no value.  Indeed exchange absolutely has value, because the physical distance between a raw resource/good and the person who 'needs' it is almost never 0.  Exchange is socially valuable, because it facilitates complex supply chains, delivers goods to consumers (and secondary/tertiary producers) and manages the inherent risks and losses associated with those activities.   Exchange value and use value are not separate, but indeed deeply intertwined.  Exchange value does not negate use value- (the apple will still be eaten and provide temporary sustenance), indeed one might even go as far as to say that the exchange value is merely the use value of the product to another person!  Regardless, this sub-argument started because you said the earth has natural value. The difference between exchange value and use value (if it exists, as per your argument) does not change the fact that if you are never around to eat the apple (and thus give it value) then it has no value of any kind.

Also, if I may ask, to what degree do you reject Marxism?  I remember you saying several times that you are not a Marxist and disagree with Marx on many things (and that you are an anarchist or syndicalist of some sort iirc) but never any reason why.  :)

I am not the best at budgeting granted but I also didn't splash out and spend all my money on alcohol or clothes or whatever else.

There being a price tag on education no matter how well the finantial schemes to help poorer people will always push it in favour of the rich. Education at any level shouldn't be easier or more realistic to get because you have more money.

Imagine if the NHS cost you money but was capped per year at say £10,000 pounds. People poorer were able to access low interest loans which only began being payed off if you earnt a fair amount but somtimes the loans were late and such, would that be acceptable to you? I think most people would hate the very idea of that and so do I.

If universities were like health care being that it's free at the point of entry I think it'd be much better off.

Contracts aren't usually lenient on ending them early - it is purely up to the landlord. If he wanted to make you pay every month until the end of the contract, he could, after which time you would receive your deposit back. However, landlords often don't care *who* is paying them, as long as they still have their income. So usually a landlord will agree to let you end early, as long as there is someone who can take over, move in, to keep their rent coming in.

3 months is *probably* long enough that an agent could advertise the flat and find a new tenant to take over on your move-out date, but it's not guaranteed. If, say, no tenant was found until 2 weeks or 2 months after you moved out, you would be bound by the contract to carry on paying the rent for that duration until a new tenant was found. Then your deposit would be returned. Note that you must carry on paying rent even if you're not living there, as is probably stipulated in the contract.

I would find it pretty difficult to reconcile something as huge as moving away from FPTP to a very slim chance that we'll not have a coalition in some edge cases here and there.

A valid point, though, and while I would never consider it a good swaying point on the balance of pros and cons of AV, it is legitimate.

So back to actual democracy again, is it really a good idea to favour a strong government with power to do things if the things it is doing are not actually the will of the majority?

Before I jump back to that point, it's worth pointing out that our  current coalition is getting a fuckload of stuff done, and isn't even remotely unstable or unable to pass some pretty aggressive economic policies.

So - democracy again - do you at least understand how the majority of the population didn't vote in their own interest at all? You are clearly happy with the economic and other decisions made by a large powerful government that doesn't represent the people particularly accurately.

However for most people are are constantly complaining about the things the government does. Becoming disillusioned with voting *at all* for all the good it does. And these are people who voted against their vote having a more balanced influence. Hell, I think a lot of these people would be happy with a government that isn't powerful and can't pass any laws at all, for all the negativity about them!

And back to your argument... while you're citing strong and stable governments, this entire argument is not based on AV itself but simply the chance of coalitions forming. I wonder... how many situations will there be in the next 50 years where there would have been a coalition under AV and not under FPTP? (And also how many where there would NOT have been a coalition under AV where  there was under FPTP!!) The total, and especially the net total, is likely to be 0 or 1 at the most.

Ramires played this game to provide literally his only skill, running fast and tackling lots. He got injured when the score was 0-0. We had to take him off, and Mourinho decided swap out Willian and Ramires for Schurrle and Mikel because that keeps the team balanced what with Mikel Obi's extreme defensive tendencies and Schurrles lack of said tendencies.

Schurrle, the substitute, then scores a goal immediately after the red card, and Diego Costa hits the post soon after. We're up 1-0, we have one substitute left, and we're seeing out the game now.

I wouldn't have changed a thing either. The game was finely balanced, and we had the advantage. The striker who has already scored 8 goals is out, plus hazard, plus a freshly subsitituted attacking player. The only two players, minus Hazard and Costa (who, arguably, would not be taken off if we want to score a goal) that aren't substitutes are Fabregas and Matic. 

Matic is our best defensive midfielder and brought on the fastest footballer I've ever seen in Jesus Navas, plus Frank Lampard. I can't blame Mourinho for maintaining a defensive midfield when Man City reacted to their red card with more attacking players.

The only two criticisms I could possibly have would be that 

1) maybe Willian should have stayed on, and Jon Obi never brought on. But then how do you replace Ramires' defensive workrate? 

2) Ivanovic could have been benched or substituted, yes, but don't forget- time and time again he is shit on by this subreddit, and time and time again he scores goals and makes teams of the month, teams of the year. He's a hard man to bench.

Anger, depression, and acceptance are certainly all present, but panicked bargaining is conspicuously absent imo.

All the actions being taken by many yes voters are productive, such as working to maintain momentum, organising conferences and meetings across the various pro-independence organisations to discuss where to go next, and joining political parties.

I don't see anyone trying to bargain with the no side, and westminster. I DO see an attitude of resigned determination emerging. Acceptance of the vote, but a firm belief that it was the wrong choice, and the formulation of clear strategies on the way forward.

I think the deciding factor in the coming weeks and months is going to be whether these various organisations can maintain cohesion under a common banner as they did under the yes umbrella.

If they all decide upon different courses of action, it could fragment the movement.

The large focus on rallying around the SNP in the recent days is a good sign however, that there is a decent chance of the cohesion being kept.

&gt;

&gt;""__Space__"" and ""__Time__"" are two [mini-episodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials) of the British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*. They were broadcast on 18 March 2011 as part of [BBC One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One)'s [Red Nose Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Nose_Day) [telethon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telethon) for the charity [Comic Relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Relief). The two mini-episodes were written by the programme's head writer [Steven Moffat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Moffat) and directed by Richard Senior.

&gt;The episodes form a two-part story, set entirely within the [TARDIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS), starring [Matt Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Smith_(actor\)) as [The Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eleventh_Doctor), and [Karen Gillan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Gillan) and [Arthur Darvill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Darvill) as married couple [Amy Pond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Pond) and [Rory Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_Williams). Rory, helping the Doctor work on the TARDIS, looks up the glass floor surrounding the console and becomes distracted by Amy's short skirt, causing him to drop the thermal couplings he was holding. This causes the three to be stuck in a ""space loop"" where the TARDIS materialises inside of the TARDIS.

&gt;""Space"" and ""Time"" were filmed in two days alongside the [sixth series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_6\)) DVD *[Night and the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_and_the_Doctor)* extras ""Bad Night"" and ""Good Night"". The episodes are intended to show what life aboard the TARDIS would be like. Several editing techniques and doubles were used for the various shots where there were more than one of the same character on the screen. The mini-episodes received mixed reviews; some scenes were thought to be funny, but other jokes were criticised for relying on sexist humour. ""Space"" and ""Time"" were later released on the DVD and Blu-ray sets of the sixth series.

Although they used the Looms to make new Gallifreyans, there were a few womb born people born. Rassilon tried to wipe them out, and made a decree that any womb born person could not inherit The Legacy of Rassilon. Additionally, each Family (House) of Gallifreyan Nobility had their own Looms, and they were all related. No direct line family trees. They were lateral, meaning each member was designated a Cousin to the others. So in effect they sort of inbred, since they all shared the basic family / house loom structure, and only the differences were programmed in. Kind of like a variable clone.

The area where the idea was thought to be most popular was the NE.  So they had a referendum in 2004.

People in England don't generally crying out for another layer of government /bureaucracy.

However I think it would be fair to say they expect to be treated more or less equally to other nations in the uk.

  If some things are determined on a uk wide basis they can live with that.  If some things are determined on a per nation basis, they can live with that.  What is blatantly unfair is having a mix of both ways in Scotland/Wales/ni, but uk wide only in England.  Everybody knows it.  

So the solution needs to address the unfairness without adding too many layers to the cake,  and without creating a new level unfairness.  It's a difficult problem.

Regional parliaments appear to be a non starter.  I doubt you'd get a majority in any English region.  What are you going to do, impose it against the will of the people?

An English parliament also means an English first minister, and an English executive, etc.  Given that England is 83% of the uk population, it would inevitably clash with the uk prime minister if both were rival parties for example.  It also makes many of the kind of things that get promised in general election campaigns meaningless, so since there will be no uk parliament with control over income tax for example if every nation is devo maxed with its only parliament, policies, and electoral cycle.   

And English only votes in west minister would have to be very carefully done to avoid making the other nations second class MPs.  Would it really be feasible to have a Scottish pm if he couldn't participate in 2 days of commons business each week, or couldnt answer questions about english-specific matters during pmqs?   Can you imagine a pmq, where the pm (if Scottish) couldn't answer a question about income tax or the NHS, because English income tax and English NHS were a matter for English MPs?

&gt; If some things are determined on a uk wide basis they can live with that. If some things are determined on a per nation basis, they can live with that. What is blatantly unfair is having a mix of both ways in Scotland/Wales/ni, but uk wide only in England. Everybody knows it. 

So that's why a regional assembly would help. An English Parliament won't do anything to decentralise the country.

&gt;  Given that England is 83% of the uk population, it would inevitably clash with the uk prime minister if both were rival parties for example. It also makes many of the kind of things that get promised in general election campaigns meaningless, so since there will be no uk parliament with control over income tax for example if every nation is devo maxed with its only parliament, policies, and electoral cycle. 

Oh no, parties might have to co-operate to get stuff done. But I doubt that an English Parliament and the UK government would somehow have drastically different political compositions.

&gt; Can you imagine a pmq, where the pm (if Scottish) couldn't answer a question about income tax or the NHS, because English income tax and English NHS were a matter for English MPs?

How is that any different to Cameron being unable to discuss the Scottish, Welsh or NI NHSes? Or any matter which is devolved?

&gt; Regional parliaments appear to be a non starter. I doubt you'd get a majority in any English region. What are you going to do, impose it against the will of the people?

Did you see Henderson defend the corner on the first goal this weekend?  He's got the best defensive skill in the midfield....

Defenders have to run out of position when the midfield doesn't defend.  That is pretty much basic knowledge.  Counterattack means the entire midfield is forward, and completely out of position after a turnover.

It's also VERY DIFFICULT to sign world class players.  And for the record, the day Liverpool got Hendo, i liked him.  The only player from that season who deserved a signing ( from what i remember =/  ).  Excellent passer of the ball, hard work rate, high energy, maintains possession.  He had all those qualities already when they signed him.

It's pretty easy to work out the cost.  HMRC shouldn't have any difficulty calculating the total claims to film tax relief.  *(Which in case you care works on the basis of allowing a 100% deduction against qualifying costs in the year incurred.)*

The other end of it is a lot trickier.  Firstly there's not always an obvious correlation between someone declaring the income and the earlier film tax relief claim.  Secondly the relief is used in avoidance schemes which inflate the relief claimed or seek to mitigate the taxation of the income when it arises.  Finally there are peripheral benefits *(Jobs, hotel sales, food sales, tourism, all that jazz.)* that are more or less impossible to measure much more accurately than a guess.",0,1411423262,null,0,false,0,ckppfgr,t3_2h4v3s,t1_ckppfgr,t1_ckpigzq,null,1426872131,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

false,Gaz133,null,null,"The problem is tactical and it's only been in the games that Sturridge hasn't played that it's shown up. It's not tactical on defense either, it's that both Villa and West Ham man marked Gerrard out of the game and they were both able to do this because we conceded sloppy early goals off set pieces. He's playing the same as last year and when we won 11 in a row no one seemed to have a problem with that but those were games when we were scoring with the first 10 minutes mostly and he was able to dictate play from the back. 

If a team wants to man mark him that's really ok, it leaves other areas open. The problem is when a team can sit deep because they have a lead within 10 minutes which is down to set piece marking which is the biggest problem right now. If a team does this it's also really important to have another mid on who can hold the ball which is why playing Lucas in the first half was disastrous. I think we've proven so far that Gerrard and Lucas should not play in the same midfield, especially if Gerrard is deep. The other midfield spot has to be Allen, Coutinho or Lallana and we were much better in the second half after Lallana came on.

Really though I just think BR doesn't know his best 11 yet which is understandable given the amount of new players and the rash of injuries to hit already. I wouldn't expect the team to play like last year, and it will be maybe 2-3 months before we really start to see some cohesion here. So long as we stay close to the top 4 I think we'll be fine.

false,Silent_Ranger,null,null,"Moreno definitely gets caught ball-watching on this play however when you look at the space around Gerrard you get the sense that he might have shift inside and up-field to prevent a take-on in a dangerous area. Having said that I don't think he was actually in position to be the one to prevent that (Lovren or Skrtel should step up and collapse a potential take-on before Gerrard is beaten). However by shifting inside Moreno does push the play out wide. Perhaps Moreno should have closed him down quicker but he doesn't overcommit which is important (note that the cut-back for noble was on if Moreno gets turned).

Second point is that Mignolet choses to cover the near post from the shot which I have no real problem with despite the tight angle, but he fails to realize that the cross to Valencia was even an option (because the ""chip"" was actually a cross that was slightly overhit and happened to go in). When you look at Mignolet's body language he is preparing for a dive as Sakho is leaning back for the chip and this causes him to be flat-footed and unable to react to the chip. I think Mignolet should be faulted for a lack of mental awareness as he could have punched it over had he been prepared for the chip (having said that it would have been a highlight save if he had managed to save that shot but for a keeper at Liverpool those types of saves should not be unusual).

Lastly we must acknowledge the goal that wasn't scored on the cutback to Noble. This pass wasn't really open because of Moreno's postioning behind the play but had he closed down Sakho and not taken the ball Noble was wide open at the penalty spot. The issue I have with this is Gerrard is walking back and seems uninterested in tracking the run. However you could argue that Gerrard is also trying to cover the square ball all the way across to Downing who has nobody within 10 yards of him at the edge of the box. 

Liverpool need at least on more body in the box on this play and a better read by Mignolet to prevent this. In general they need more commitment tracking back as Gerrard, Hendo and Lucas are all in saunter mode while West Ham had 3 players sprinting out of the midfield. Lastly at the moment the cross/shot is played every player on Liverpool is staring at the ball and not at who is in a dangerous position for West Ham.

The issue being that Juve has a legitimately word-class defense whereas Liverpolol has a newly constructed defense that is still working out the kinks (that and Vidal and Pogba are significantly better than all of Liverpools CM except for Henderson).

I want to see Liverpool play a system more like Spain who had Busquets and Alonso sit in front of the defense to  offer cover on the counter and control possession.

1) We play a 4-3-3 with 1 striker and that's Sturridge and keep Balotelli as our second choice. Balotelli has a lot of talent and potential so I'm not sure how much I like this as a solution but it could be the right choice temporarily while we find a way to integrate Balotelli fully. I like him a lot as a player and you can see his ability but he just doesn't naturally fit our system, in my mind... He needs some work and coaching before we get the best out of him. 


2) We experiment and try to figure out a way to fit Balotelli in ASAP probably by messing around with the diamond when Sturridge is back and the like. I think this way means Gerrard has to go because I don't think both of them are mobile enough to be in the same team without us seriously changing our style.

-Buy rounds of drinks, as sometimes there are some unknown deals (3 for £5 or something)

-When you are already out and sober, buy the amount of drink that will get you to the level you want to be at within a relatively short space of time (accounting for the speed of alcohol intake).

-GET A RECEIPT for every single transaction you make. At the end of every week, I compile all my receipts, work out what I have spent for that week, staple and file them away, and upload the data to a spread sheet to assess whether I have to under spend for the next 7 days

-When I do have to under spend, social life is always the one that has to take the hit. Your a student and you need to eat well.

-Sometimes, its just a case of learning how to say no. This varies on your year, but occasionally you just have to accept that going out is going to break your budget and your work ethic (less so for 1st years)

The problem with that theory is that the SNP can, and will, change as [a result of this referendum](http://www.scotsman.com/news/marco-biagi-snp-must-now-lead-as-a-government-1-3548061).

&gt; I'm hoping that this is just a short term reaction in the immediate aftermath of the referendum and things will calm down once reforms kick in.

There's clearly a little bit of an overreaction from all sides - people claiming (incorrectly) that the result was rigged to politicians claiming (insanely) that future referendums [should be illegal](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article4212654.ece).

That's fine. Give it more than a weekend.

&gt;If the governing parties are stupid enough not to deliver on what they've promised to the whole UK, not just Scotland, then that will guarantee Scotland will leave and it would serve them right.

And this, I think, is the SNP's new goal. Their goal is not independence for its own sake, it is independence for the benefits it can bring to Scotland.

If those benefits can be brought closer through devo-max, great. If getting Scotland to devo-max makes the final step to independence seem easier, or safer, or more inevitable - also great.

Last week very close to half of Scotland was willing to walk away from the UK.

Not every party has to solve every problem.

Throughout the campaign the Labour party argued that there was nothing fundamentally different between the working class in Plymouth and the working class in Perth, therefore Scotland shouldn't walk away from those people. There's nothing fundamentally different about the working class in those two cities and the working class in Portlaoise so why aren't Labour campaigning for Ireland to rejoin the UK?

&gt; If the SNP actually decided to do this then I don't doubt that they'd see substantial growth in numbers within a decade and either be running the country or at least have scared the other parties enough that they'd buck their ideas up.

&gt; Of course, there are simple and relatively inexpensive changes you can make to your car that won't impact on your insurance premiums but will make it feel that little bit special. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

&gt; * Change your steering wheel, the gear stick head or the gear shaft gaiter
&gt; * Seat and seat belt covers
&gt; * **Change the style of your hub caps**
&gt; * New car mats
&gt; * A smart tax-disc holder
&gt; * Stickers for the outside, or inside, of your car
* Give your car a name
* Get yourself and your car organised with a boot tidy
* Fit a personalised number plate (your insurer may charge a one-off fee to change this on your policy but it shouldn't affect your insurance premium)

maximise

&gt; I wanna study either Computer Science or Physics (don't know yet). 

want to (don't use slang in your application, obviously this is fine on the Internet), also don't capitalise CS or physics, they aren't proper nouns. 

 &gt; Right now I'm in first (of 3) year of high school. If it matters, I'm student of V LO in Kraków 

Right now I'm in my first of three years at high school. If it's relevant, I'm a student of ....

&gt;  which is 4th best rated high school in Poland in this year. 

which is the ~~forth~~ fourth best rated...

&gt; 
&gt; And I will be writing Polish Matura, not IB, so I assume I will need to meet more requirements. 

*I'm not really sure what this is*

Declaring independence unilaterally without a refurrendum would be illegal as fuck. Trying to hold another refurrendum without a parliamentary bill would be illegal as fuck. 

&gt;Don't get me wrong, I firmly believe independence would be a mistake for Scotland and the UK, but I said it back in the '90s when Devolution was going ahead and I'll say it again: Once the ball starts rolling, it will eventually end up at the bottom of the hill. There'll be another call in maybe twenty years, maybe another referendum, more devolved powers, etc, etc, etc. Each step another move towards independence.

It's hit its high water mark. Full devolved powers and it makes no sense to go any further. 

And lets see how popular nationalist parties are in any part of the UK once they get into power and start setting taxes. 

People are running this narrative because they are bitter democracy didn't go with way, or they see it as exiting. It just not going to happen. The majority of Scotish people identify and are quite happy being British it appears. The refurrendum was a landslide.

It's bizarre! Dude was a geordie, he's in no position to judge me!

What d'you mean how was it? I just got in the way. It wasn't my intention. One of them grabbed me and shoved me to the floor, I got up and then another one shoved me into the corner behind the door, so I slammed it onto his ankle. PC who took my statement had a good laugh at that one. 

Had another PC take my statement once for a theft, he whipped out his phone and started showing me photos of his dog. Like, that can't be normal, can it?

Actually there's a girl still on the sick, claiming PTSD, from the armed robbery (knife) back in January. I'm well annoyed. She's been paid for doing fuck all this whole time, and I got *one day off*, and that's only because it was actually my day off!

I also have glasses, somewhere around here. I'll put them on if I have to!

Unfortunately i'm normally right with my football assessments.  Especially about players.  One example is, i LOVED Torres before he went to Liv, and said he would be good.  When he hit bad form at Liverpool, and hurt his knee, i knew it was over ( the game honestly moved past  him once possessioni based soccer spread around the globe ).  Sadly i was right.  Liverpool made off like bandits.  I have been told i'm wrong and he could still turn it around to this day ( but lets be honest, at least most people have realized this by now, but people still cling to that golden boot against Haiti  lol ).  Another example is that i thought the Carroll money would have been spent better on Javi Martinez.  MUCH more valuable a player. 

I don't look back and say i ""would have done"".  Hindsight is stupid, and easy to use.  Just like i supported Hendo right from the start, just like i said Shelvey isn't much, and just like i said Borini is overrated at Roma, i say these things beforehand and stick with them until proven otherwise.

1. Books - Didn't need them, they were at the library for free and the internet is a suitable resources, but it depends on your course really.

2. Unnecessary food - I ate really well, spent quite a lot of money on having the odd dominoes, nice fajita meals etc, I probably shouldn't have.

3. Girls - If you're set on marrying a bird you met at uni, fine, but I spent far to much on average relationships with nice days out etc. There's a line to draw between having fun and a relationship costing too much.

4. Clothes - Try and buy a bunch of club-worthy clothing before you get to uni, going out in the same shirt every week does show. A definite problem to solve with off-term job money, not your weekly budget.

5. Weed - I didn't myself but I saw many first-year-friends social life become non existent due to weed. When 'having fun' is buying a 20 bag and doing absolutely it's shit really, no memories will be made sat on your sofa getting high.

Things I wish I'd have spent money on;

1. Stuff that will make memories, course trip to China? Do it.

2. Being sociable in any way, i.e. going out. Friends aren't made at home cooking yourself a quality meal, buy a 4 pack and go out.

Random tips;

1. If you failed at making friends join societies until you find a suitable bunch.

2. Don't buy girls drinks.

3. Don't lose shit.

4. Do be a cool guy.

5. Find out what makes you different and work around that.

6. Working for a club is a top way to find birds.

7. Don't fail your course, from what I found, I could chill and not do a right lot for around 6 weeks, then knuckle down for a month, then chill.

8. Don't fail your course.

9. Make friends with nerds or girls to help you not fail your course.

10. Get peoples numbers, a text can tell you answer to tests, parties and shit, cool stuff.

11. If it's a campus uni, don't be a massive bellend because word gets around.

12. Fancy dress night? Do it. Charity shops are good.

13. Halloween is top.

14. Don't settle for mates you're not 100% friends with, there are plenty of people, revert to tip #1.

15. If you don't like a module, still pull your fingers out, a bad 40% can ruin your overall.

16. Second year definitely counts, try.

17. Don't be the 'I don't like pictures' guy, you end up with 3 years of university and no pictures as memories.

18. If you can do Erasmus, i.e. a year abroad, do it, unless you have amazing friends . You might lose your friends when you come back for 3rd year, and it might cost a year in tuition fees, but the government fund the shit out of you, and if you're in a place like Prague that government money will go a long way.

An Everton fan liked to amuse himself by scaring every Liverpool fan he saw strutting down the street in an obnoxious red shirt.

He thought he would do a good deed, so he pulled over and asked the priest, ""Where are you going, Father?"" ""I'm going to give Mass at St. Francis church, about two miles down the road,"" replied the priest. ""Climb in, Father. I'll give you a lift!"" The priest climbed into the passenger seat, and they continued down the road. Suddenly, the driver saw a Liverpool fan walking down the road, and he instinctively swerved as if to hit him. But, as usual, he swerved back onto the road just in time. Even though he was certain that he had missed the guy, he still heard a loud THUD. not knowing where the noise came from, he glanced in his mirrors but still didn't see anything. He then remembered the priest, and he turned to the priest and said, ""sorry Father, I almost hit that Liverpool fan."" ""That's OK,"" replied the priest. ""I got him with the door.""

It makes sense on paper, but actually makes little sense as it made Amy seem more important. However, Amy was more important than normal companions that season. Which is fine. The show needs to change up the formula every once in awhile. I think the season fell flat due to Moffat not taking direct control over the whole season. If he wanted a season arc like that he needed to tie each episode into the arc better. The filler episodes that season were more obvious than in previous seasons since they didn't tie into the main story. Each season has filler, and filler episodes play important roles, but that season was worse due to Moffat not forcing each episode to progress the arc.

Fri 17th - Arrive in London, jet lagged / tired

- Travel to Bath
- Depending on time of day, maybe have a few hours of daylight/energy to see Bath?
- Night in Bath

Sat 18

- Need to travel to Oxford at some point today.  So, leave Bath early, having seen little of it yesterday (it's surely worth at least one whole day), get to Oxford around lunchtime, to allow a 'full' half day in Oxford?  Or see a bit more of Bath first and have less time in Oxford?
- Night in Oxford

Sun 19

- Need to travel to London at some point today.  So, leave Oxford early, having only had max half a day there (it's surely worth at least one whole day), get to London around lunchtime, to allow a 'full' half day in London?  See a bit more Oxford first and have only the evening in London?
- Night in London

...etc, etc and Chester to Ayr is getting even worse, will you even see Ayr in daylight?!

It's not until Edinburgh you're 2 nights in the same place, giving yourself a full day to explore that place without having to lose half of it getting to the next place.  Which personally I feel is a realistic minimum to soak up a place rather than whistlestopping through to tick off the selfie and _next!_

So I'd still probably look to chop stuff tbh, particularly in England.  and why the the loop back to London, is that because you have fixed tickets for HP on that date only?

And Amy was consistent and necessary, so she gets a bit of a pass. But series 7 was basically a train wreck in my opinion. There were individual good episodes but the series as a whole left me feeling empty, like ""Is this what this show has become?"" I feel that has a bit to do with Moffat being so overly focused on the 50th, But the 50th was wonderful through and through. Then Smith's regen was okay, I wanted more, but I feel like everyone wanted something different out of that and thats why it was so disjointed. But so far Capaldi has sold me. It feels like he has the potential to be the wrath, the silly, the serious, the goofy all of it. I dont know how i feel for sure about series yet. The individual parts are really neat, we just have wait and see if it adds up to good whole. But Capaldi really really feels like the Doctor.

The style of play tends to favor wings playing in closer because they CAN. They're as dangerous as any striker, esp more so than when we had Torres. Look at ANY of our wings and you'll see the same. Under Jose, we tend to see our backs cross in much more than our actual wingers. There's nothing wrong with this. It's just a style of play. Enables backs to get back quickly and puts more striking into the box. Doesn't mean they CAN'T cross, it just means they do it less often than traditional wingers.

false,mkfffe,mcgann,McGann,"I'm with you on those episodes (Vincent and the Doctor, The Doctor's Wife, The God Complex, A Town Called Mercy, The Rings of Akhaten). They are good. However, I think you and I have different tastes. You would rather have subtle arc (Bad Wolf, planets missing) and I would love a season with a massive arc that is thrown into your face. However, we both lost in series six and seven. The cracks were more subtle than the following seasons, but they were nicely done in my opinion. 

My problems with series six was that Moffat didn't go enough into the season's arc. He put a lot of thought into the arc. It's a really cool story idea. However, he executed the idea the way Davies would. Davies arcs were small and didn't show up until the end. Bad Wolf is just a few words. Mr. Saxon was a politician. The planets are missing. Those were weird, but they didn't grab the Doctor's attention.

In series six, the Silence grab the Doctor's attention. They kidnap a little girl and experiment with her. Amy is both pregnant and not. That's not a subtle arc, that's a major story line. However, unlike what I was hoping for, we then follow up the premier two-parter with an episode about pirates and then the TARDIS taking human form. While entertaining (or not in the case of pirates), they did not continue the arc. Moffat should have put his foot to the pedal and drove the arc all season. Find the little girl only to lose her to the Silence. Discover that the papal mainframe has a splinter group that wants the Doctor dead for some cryptic reason having to do with Tranzalore. However, Moffat didn't do that. He treated the idea like Davies treated his arcs. You see glimpses of them here and there, but they aren't important to the episode. Which makes filler episodes feel worse. The Doctor's Wife is my favorite episode ever. However, it came in a weird space. The main plot of the season wasn't moving, even though the main plot concerned the Doctor directly. It's not like Saxon where he was trying to subvert the Doctor subtly. Amy is being affected by something.

Ok, so I'm rambling again. What I'm trying to say is that you may not enjoy season long arcs. That's okay. I really want a season long arc. However, Moffat mishandled the arc he had in series six and I doubt we'll get one like that again. It's a shame cause it could have been awesome.

-The main idea behind my selection is pretty much playing the first team barring stevie and sterling who could probably both do with a rest. We just need the lads to play together as much as possible and hope all the minutes translate into continuity

-Would want us to go with our strongest back 5, the quicker they can form an understanding the better

-Lucas in for Stevie because he needs a rest. Also gives lucas a chance to show what he can do when stevie isn't fit

-I don't think hendo has heard of fatigue so he should be fine

-Coutinho for Sterling. Will give raheem a rest and allow countinho to try work his magic against a lesser team and maybe find some form

-Borini instead of Lambert. Although i think Lambert is a better player, I'm not confident a front three of Coutinho, Lambert and Balotelli will work. There just isn't enough pace or anyone who really wants to make runs behind the defense. Them three would all want to come towards the ball, while borini should stretch the defense and create space

I very much deny that Soldado seems the better fit, to suggest it's undeniable is crazy when Soldado has continued to flounder in several ""systems"" under different managers. Missing sitters is not his only issue, he's just not that good with build up play, it's mostly fancy flicks which aren't required that often.

 [**Bootstrap paradox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap%20paradox): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The __bootstrap paradox__, or __ontological paradox__, is a [paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_paradox) of [time travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel) that refers to scenarios whereby items or information are passed from the future to the past, which in turn become the same items or information that are subsequently passed from the future to the past - this creates a circularity of cause-effect such that the items or information have no discernible origin. Thus, the paradox raises the ontological questions of where, when and by whom the items were created or the information derived.

Which is exactly what this is. Sure, it's a miniseries contained within another, bigger series, but that's basically what it is: Torchwood eschewed it's usual episodic stories in order to use a season as a miniseries. Much different than when Lost or Fringe did the same (i.e. eschewed episodic seasons), because this wasn't about leading towards finally paying off a greater plot in general that'd already been in the show since the start - it was basically one, long contained story that's almost like one long episode itself, just split into parts.

Whatever you wanna call it though, even if you don't wanna call it a miniseries, the actual word to describe it isn't even my point,so well done for trying to derail it. My actual point still stands:

Whatever you wanna call it - miniseries, non-episodic serial, extended-film-split-into-separate-episodes, behanemnipling (I coined it to mean exactly what I'm talking about, in case you try to argue again each of those, again missing my point), whatever - (and here's my point, pay attention:) British writers have been doing this style of television writing for years (nay, decades), where they take one idea and make an extended film out of it, split across multiple episodes while avoiding episodic plots that are only in one episode. This isn't anything different from that, bar maybe being like 20% longer than the average miniseries (and even then by far not being one of the longest examples ever anyway) and thus isn't that original.

I'm not saying it's not excellent television, I'm just saying it isn't totally groundbreaking. That's only an insult in your head, because I really don't mean it as one.

**Dave--Cahill--Ivanovic--Luis**  I honestly do not see Zouma starting based on the fact that we hardly saw youth last season in the defence. We also need work on the defensive portion.

**Mikel--Ramires**  Rami is out for the next game with 2 yellows so we can rest the others for the PL this sunday.

**Salah--Oscar--Schürrle** this will give Salah a chance to show us that he does deserve a starting XI spot. I think both Schürrle and him will be playing hard rather than others who would take it easy. Oscar needs to stay in top shape if he wants to regain his position on the team which seems unstable as of late. Some extra minutes should keep him up.

**Drogba** I am going to get some stick for this one but honestly, I think this is the team he should be starting against. It was wrong to start him vs Schalke but Bolton are  bit under schalke to say the least. He should be able to bang in a goal at least. If it's not working, Remy should be next up. Costa should remain on the bench and be rested. 

If we concede somehow, and are down, Remy and Hazard should be the first to come down. But honestly, we shouldn't need to worry.

if a player is going to beat you with a shot while being covered by a defender from that angle fine. You are taught from a young age that if a ball is swung out wide, you should be on the closer to the back post than the front post in order to deal with a cross. This is because it is easier to move towards the ball and catch rather than have to catch a ball while moving backwards.

not only is his positioning all wrong, but look how small he makes himself in the goal. he's crouched into a ball. I get that he is ready to make a save with his feet (recently caught out on a low shot from man city), but hes just making the target bigger and its like he hasnt even considered the idea that a player might actually fucking cross from the right side of the box.

now im getting all mad cuz its fucking SHITE goalkeeping.

there are other players to blame too, but mignolets inability to deal with balls in the air is infuriating. ",0,1411446312,null,0,false,0,ckq0r9m,t3_2h5ygq,t1_ckq0r9m,t1_ckpqfkl,null,1426866780,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

false,Kiram,mcgann,McGann,"You know, this season is really gearing up to be one of my favorites of the Moffat era, and it really all comes down to one thing: Pacing.

It was kind of hard to put my finger on it at first. Something that RTD's era seemed to have that was lacking in Moffat's run that made them sit kind of weird, and it struck me after watching this one: it's pacing. The episode moves along at a brisk pace, it wraps everything up when it needs to, and even though there were plenty of places where it could have been elongated, it didn't feel like much was sacrificed for time, and the concept never felt stretched, either.

So many episodes of 11's run, including some of the Specials, felt really, really poorly paced in retrospect. A lot of the episodes felt to me like they had enough material for 1.5 episodes, and either ran awkwardly long at a 2-parter, or felt clipped and cut-short as a single episode. Which is frustrating, because there were a lot of good ideas there. 

All of my least favorite episodes seem to have this problem: Victory of the Daleks seemed to be the first half of a 2-parter that ended in the middle. Meanwhile, the Wedding of River Song seemed to hit all the wrong notes at all the wrong times. The action was misplaced, the character beats seemed forced, just... everything seemed to be hitting off-key. Even Night Terrors felt like it couldn't decide what it wanted to be - it either lingered too long on what should have been fairly brief character moments between the Amy and Rory, or it spent entirely too much time explaining with the Doctor and the Kid, depending on what you wish that episode would have been.

____________________________________________________

Okay, that explination got out of hand, but basically, whatever it was that changed between seasons seems to have worked. The pacing is much, much tighter, and I even if the episodes end up being kind of forgettable (like the first episode of the season), they work as self-contained stories. They hit the action beats at all the right moments, the character asides are just the right size to advance the plot and color the characters without detracting from the action, and the whole experience feels *tighter*.

Just talk to your kid and if your child can't handle it, tune in next week.  For what it's worth, while it was always a kids show it also aimed to be educational.  Ie; assuming your kid isn't thick.

A man with no personality, who looks like a lost 16yr old wearing his dads suit for his first day of work experience. This message is doomed to fail because he is not an inspiring, uplifting leader. Simply, he can't sell Obama-style ""hope"" to the population.

Not to mention that the economy is actually doing pretty well right now. Unemployment down. Inflation under control. Stock market up. 

Yet he again refuses to say where they would get the money for ANY of these ideas. He loosely mentioned a tax on expensive homes, but even then Labour won't ""speculate"" on it - so what use is that?

&gt;The Labour leader will also pledge to halve number of low-paid workers and to create a million new ""green"" technology jobs.

How?

&gt;Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said in his speech to conference on Monday that Labour would not borrow money to fund spending commitments.

So, they're going to harvest the magic money trees they have planted?

Either you borrow more, or you tax people more, or you save money by cutting other things.

&gt;In another measure aimed at younger voters, he will vow to double the number of people getting on the property ladder by pledging to be build 200,000 new homes a year by 2020.

200,000 per year by 2020 isn't much of an increase. We are already building around 150,000 per year right now in 2014, and that number is growing. The number grew 20% since last year, so even if nobody does anything it would hit 200,000 naturally.

Source: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/house-building-in-england-april-to-june-2014

This just seems like a shit headline grab rather than anything of substance that would make any difference. Labour won't attack house prices any more than the Conservatives would.

&gt;He will also pledge to ""transform"" the way the NHS works, with improved GP access and better preventative care.

Let's not. We just had some changes in GP surgeries. Let's not just mindlessly jerk it back again with vague promises. And how is he going to have ""better GP access""? Are the government going to increase the number (costs ££), or pay GPs to work more hours (costs ££) or what?

I also notice that while whining about energy bills, he has dropped his mysterious proposal to fix the prices and freeze bills. And fwiw, the UK still has pretty average utility bill prices compared to Europe. So increased costs are due to the market, and not the Tory government policies.

So come on Ed - come up with some REAL policies, not just vague soundbites or things which are too good to be true. We'd all love to get extra services and perks without spending any extra money, but you've been criticising this government for ""efficiency savings"" and calling them ""cuts"" relentlessly. And what does he have to say?:

&gt;Mr Miliband is expected to outline money-saving measures to show he can build a ""world-class country"" with no extra money.

Ah. Money-saving measures? Not ""cuts"" though, right? And surely not the same efficiency drive that he has criticised the Tories for?

false,lepusfelix,null,null,"&gt; If you combine their polling numbers, they consistently get around 50% of the vote if not more, so why does this sub seem to be overwhelmingly opposed to them? To the point of outright spite.

I can't speak for anyone else, but I am opposed to them because of their overwhelmingly destructive policies. Also 50% of the vote does not equal 50% of people. It just means everyone else is too apathetic to bother voting against them, and you end up with low turnouts. Also, I haven't seen one instance of them getting 50% of the vote. If the Tories had, they wouldn't be in a coalition. If UKIP had, they'd have had a lot of trouble putting bums on seats in parliament because they'd have more seats than bums.

&gt; Why isn't there the same level of hatred towards Labour?

Again, only speaking for myself, but I dislike Labour a great deal. Labour were responsible for a lot of the policies that the Tories are now continuing with. It can be argued that maybe Labour had a grip on things and stopped them getting bad, but for me, 'it can be argued' does not a fact make.

&gt; Why does this sub love the greens so much?

They don't. Looking around on here, I think I see more KIPpers than Greens. If there was a Green bias here, I would imagine I'd spend a fair amount of time hearing about the success that is Brighton and Hove. Sadly, I know little about how they're doing down there, aside from the occasional rant about how well they're apparently not doing. The strange thing is that all the things I hear bad about the Greens in Brighton are exactly the same things being implemented in my area of London, which has a rich mix of Tory and Labour councillors.

I voted Tory in the last local election. I voted Green in the concurrent European election. I will be voting Green nationally in 2015. So why did I vote Tory? It's simple. I voted on promises and what's happening. You make a promise I want to see carried forward, you get my vote to do so. If you're currently in power and doing stuff I don't like, I vote someone else. My local Tory is actually quite awesome and got a lot done for my estate, which is why I voted for her.",0,1411448259,null,0,false,0,ckq1h9b,t3_2h4o6j,t1_ckq1h9b,t3_2h4o6j,null,1426866442,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

That's not saying I wouldn't take him because he's still a massive talent but right now, he'd find it difficult playing for most other Premier League teams. Honestly, I love both Schurrle and Willian but sometimes I think we need someone who's just a tier up; Reus, Draxler(probably around the same level but has far more potential imo), would have loved us to steal Sanchez. We don't necessarily need a game-changing winger because we already have Hazard but the more game changers we add to the team the less men teams can pile on Hazard.

I wouldn't mind having a squad like this.

**GK**; Courtois, Cech/Schwarzer
**RB**; Azpi, Iva
**CB**; Terry, Cahill, Zouma, Stones
**LB**; Luis, Ake(not English but HG)
**CDM/CM**; Matic, Chalobah
**CM**; Cesc, Ramires
**CM/CAM**; Oscar, Barkley
**RW**; Willian, Salah
**LW**; Hazard, Schurrle
**ST**; Costa, Remy, Bamford

Isn't much different to the team now but adds young English players as backup who have potential to become starters, Barkley could even challenge Oscar now(if he wasn't injured). With that team we would be able to field two completely different lineups and still have another spot available if we would like an extra squad player in there(Mikel). We wouldn't need to make any changes for the Champs League as Terry, Ake, Chalobah and Bamford would fill the Club Trained quota and imo it's all completely possible.

What you do is you go on the National Rail website and buy tickets to Liverpool Lime Street as soon as possible (usually, the earlier the cheaper). The train ride is about 2 hours long. From London, you go to Euston Station and take the train to Liverpool Lime Street.

An alternative: buy coach tickets (they are usually really cheap but the ride takes about 6 hours). In London you go to Victoria Coach Station and you take a coach up to Liverpool, which brings you somewhere near the University of Liverpool.

Liverpool is a great city albeit some parts are dodgy (particularly the north of Liverpool). The center is fabulous and the Albert Docks is really beautiful and relaxing. Bold Street is also very nice with lots of restaurants, shops and the UK's most prestigious store -- Home Bargains. 

It is true that people in Liverpool have a strong accent. It is called ""scouse"" and when I went there I had to have my boyfriend translate for me sometimes. But overall, the locals are really friendly and proud of their local culture. I've heard that Liverpool is very different from the rest of the UK. Also, be careful in certain areas like Anfield (where the football stadiums are).

When I stayed in the UK as an international student, I made quite a few mistakes and didn't sign up for health insurance, a bank account or a proper credit card. The UK uses credit cards with chips in them, so make sure yours has a chip. (Mine didn't :( ) My cousin in London helped me with the banking situation, and I was on my own when it came to health issues. But I managed to survive... somehow :)

I wish I could trade places with you. I miss Liverpool so much and I want to visit it again.

The Law isnt clear at all and quite contradictory and given its never been tested is an absolute legal minefield. 

If the Scottish people vote the SNP in with a clear majority then that is democracy and does give a mandate for either another referendum or a unilateral declaration.

How would Westminster justify saying no to the democratic will of the peoples government? They cant and would be seen internationally as pariahs.

Scotland votes SNP with a huge majority with a clearly stated aim of independence from the party. They declare independence and Westminster says no.

The SNP go in front of the UN and invoke higher powers. It would be a fucking disaster for the UK globally.

The problem with democracy is that the loser gets to try again and rally the vote and if they then win they are perfectly entitled to overrule anything that has gone before.

This fallacious argument that there cannot be another referendum and that all opposition to a no vote should end is a nonsense and a fundamental misunderstanding of democracy.

Political opposition has not suddenly been made illegal and people are perfectly allowed to voice their distaste with the next vote and openly state that in the event of a different result at the next elections or the ones after or after that that they will do things differently.

It seem that many in the no camp now advocate burying the will of 1.6 million people and turning the nation into a totalitarian state. 

You might not like the fact that people are allowed to continue pushing for independence but your liking it is frankly fucking irrelevant just as had yes won the no camp are and would be perfectly allowed to campaign for rejoining the union.

By winning you do not get to declare the oppositions position null and void and that it should cease to exist

I think there's a huge amount of wishful thinking from SNP supporters in statements like that. Here are some polls I found on the interwebs.


In the Scottish parliament elections, the last poll (from this month) has SNP at 38%, Labour at 34%. Labour have been ahead several times during the referendum campaign period. And it goes without saying that their side in the referendum (which, via Darling and Brown, they lead) won by a healthy margin.  
http://whatscotlandthinks.org/questions/how-would-you-use-your-constituency-vote-in-a-scottish-parliament-election#table


The same site has Westminster voting intentions, and they're coming out approximately the same. Interestingly, Labour's rating has not dropped dramatically from their 2010 figures (mid 30s)- the SNP have overtaken them by growing by about 10%, largely at the expense of the Lib Dems (down 10 points to 5%). *  
http://whatscotlandthinks.org/questions/how-would-you-be-likely-to-vote-in-a-uk-general-election#table

I'm not saying a Labour collapse *can't* happen, but I am saying it *hasn't happened yet*.

EDIT: * Having checked the fine print on this table, there is another interesting tidbit. All polls in the table since September 2013 have been Survation ones- which include 16 years olds. The last poll for 18+ only (i.e., people who will be eligible to vote in the Westminster elections) was one year ago September 2013- which put Labour some 19% ahead of the SNP. As soon as 16 year olds were included (4 months later), you see a big swing the other way. No way of knowing what that means now a year later, but judging by the previous polls that showed 16/17 year olds being significantly more pro-independence than older voters, one might expect these people to be skewing the polls towards SNP in a way that won't pan out in 9 months time at the ballot box.

It's just bitter yes votings grasping at straws frankly, you don't just get to rerun democratic plebicites over and over again until you get the result you want. 

It would be legal as basildon council declaring independence unilaterally.

You'd not get any major nations recognising simple because the U.S, Germany, Spain etc doesn't want to have their democratic sub units just declare independence whenever they don't like how things are going. 


There is no precedent and is definitely super illegal (indeed I just showed the example of British law regarding treason to another guy involving how the easter rising tried to go about it). It's just people in the SNP clutching at straws because their entire reason d'etre is indepenence these days and that ship has now sailed.

Ok why does that seal the deal. SNP is unlikely to ever get returned on anything north of 60% participation as well I might add. Let alone an outright majority of the total vote. 

Nor does 'democratic mandate', explain how Holyrood can ust invent laws for itself.

Nor does this, as Salmold actually was suggesting follow the precedence of any of the Dominion nations.

Democratic is irrelevant, legality is relevant. Your using democracy like a catch all super political principle that means eventually no matter what, this thing will happen.

One side will have to prove there is no sovereignty one will have to prove there is.
Neither can be done so immediately as there are contradictory laws and precedents already.

false,Auntfanny,english,England,"Here is an overview of what they did (from the FT)

Lets say the supplier is, say, Lex’s Liverworst (LL).

1) LL ships Tesco some liverwurst at an agreed cost of £100m (Tesco takes delivery, does not pay).

2) Tesco sells the liverwurst for £110m over the next two weeks or so.

3) After 60 days or so, Tesco pays LL £90m not £100M and assures LL that it will be made whole eventually – we will ship more of your goods next month, or we will pay you a little more later, or lets just renogiate the price, or something.

4) If Tesco books the extra £10m in the current period, that is “accelerated commercial income” (as in: “Tesco has identified an overstatement of its expected profit for the half year, principally due to the accelerated recognition of commercial income.”)

5) But if it becomes clear that the supplier will have to be paid, that recognition of income will have to be reversed...

This is clear manipulation and aggressive manipulation of revenue recognition rules.  Something that was clearly picked up by PWC in their last audit in 2013. They were aware that payments from suppliers needed to be handled responsibly. In Tesco’s annual report, where they state that the “recognition of commercial income” was a top priority for them 

City firm Cantor Fitzgerald reckon that Tesco’s CEO Dave Lewis may have had suspicions about accounting practices even before he joined the company last month.

Lewis was lured from Unilever; one of Tesco’s major suppliers.

Cantor also stated that ""We suspect Dave Lewis was aware of Tesco’s actions while at Unilever and from comments across the UK/Global supplier base so we expect he already had several questions for Tesco’s commercial team when he joined.""

Cantor has been raising concerns over Tesco’s accounting practices for some time.  Back in late 2013, they argued that Tesco had been over-stating its UK commercial gross profit by £200m+ per year, by deducting monies from suppliers’ trading accounts or extending payment dates without notice.",0,1411458598,null,0,false,0,ckq47nn,t3_2h3yad,t1_ckq47nn,t1_ckq3tmd,null,1426865167,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Why not, it peacefully succeeded along vaugely similar lines, but no one recognises or cares because the international community is committed to somali as a whole. 

&gt;Yes UN law is only followed when it suits but the notion of say Salmond addressing the UN asking for recognition of Scotland would be a huge embarrassment for the UK.

I think you reall over estimate how much cares the rest of the west would give. Or how free he'd be at that point, fi he tried this.

In reality a Holyrood that tried it, would a holyrood in a series of cells by the end of the day. 

&gt;2 years ago yes getting 45% was an impossibility and I am clearly a yes voter. Never is a dangerous thing to say in politics as it has a habit of happening with surprising regularity across the world and history.

You can beleive whatever you want pal, there's been too much of a conflation between my position that I think indepence (as a scot) is economic nonsense, with the idea that I don't think it's a position people should be allowed to have.

I think its stupid, but its not advocating dog rape. 


Even then, I really have to stress this, 45% happened but it was a landslide for Yes. And in reality we are really talking about a raise from what 33-38? Scotish independence has allways beeen a minority view in Scotland. It's likely going no where, but its also likely hit its high water mark.

Key parts of he argument, i.e economic prosperity and ability to spend on social welfare in access of the rest of the UK. Are running out of time, the latter will fade as oil fades (not the same as saying Scotland will become poor) and the SNP are going to have a hard time of arguging the latter once proper fiscal independence comes ni.

the 18th was the high water mark. Proper devolution will have it descend back into the realm of within a generation, simply being based on entho-nationalism.

But even worse as we saw this weekend, dont deploy him in a three man midfield with Lucas and Hendo. Im still trying to figure out why BR would play Lucas in a CM role as he offers nothing moving foward as its just not his role anymore and does not have the mobility for it.

Go back and have a look at the games were we have played badly this season(almost all of them bar Spurs) and the reasons above are why we are being overrun in Midfield and offer very forward with our link up play. In every game BR has corrected these issues with subs, but it is usually when we are a goal a 2 down and by then teams are ready to park the bus.

false,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; Scotish independence has allways beeen a minority view in Scotland. It's likely going no where, but its also likely hit its high water mark.

Alternatively, the transition from being an integral part of the British Empire to an independent country is a relatively gradual one.

The 1979 devolution referendum got 52% support, the 1997 devolution referendum got 74%.

The 2014 independence referendum got 45% support, who's to say what one in 2030 (for example) might have?

&gt; Key parts of he argument, i.e economic prosperity and ability to spend on social welfare in access of the rest of the UK. Are running out of time, the latter will fade as oil fades (not the same as saying Scotland will become poor) and the SNP are going to have a hard time of arguging the latter once proper fiscal independence comes ni.

I for one would welcome oil being exhausted, as I think it is an enormous red herring. Scotland doesn't have some window of opportunity where the only possible time it could be independent is in the 70 years that oil is being extracted from the North Sea.

We'll have to see what the future brings of course, but bear in mind that ""proper fiscal independence"" has not yet been proposed. What has been proposed is that Scotland can vary income tax by up to 10% from the UK rate - but has to vary all three tax bands in unison (if it wants to raise the higher rate, it has to raise the basic rate).

I suspect Westminster will find it hard to implement true fiscal independence, as per devo max, purely because that makes Scotland more likely to be come independent over time rather than less (by far the biggest objection people had this time round was that independence was simply too big a step - devo-max makes that step much, much smaller).

&gt; Proper devolution will have it descend back into the realm of within a generation, simply being based on entho-nationalism.

But also we need to play a high defensive line so that we are very compact and there is no space between the midfield and the defenders, making the DM per se redundant. This is where Gerrard can then play at his best.

Rodgers usually plays with a high defensive line. The reason we are currently not doing it is because Mignolet isn't a sweeper keeper. We need a better goalkeeper, somebody who's aware of the space between him and the high defensive line and who isn't afraid to come out. Ideally somebody like Manuel Neuer. Until then, we can't play a high defensive line and playing Gerrard with Allen and Henderson is sub-optimal if there is too much space between the defense and him. 

The other alternative would be to permanently switch to a 5-3-2 with the extra defender helping out Gerrard in midfield i.e. just basically taking the defensive responsibility of Gerrard. However for this formation to work, we need time and our players need to adapt. This isn't a solution right away.

So right now, because we lack the appropriate keeper, because we don't have time to prepare a new formation and because we have so many injuries, dropping Gerrard and playing Lucas is the best solution.

I suggest you [read the transcript](http://skynews.skypressoffice.co.uk/newstranscripts/murnaghan-210914-interview-alex-salmond) that this story is based on:

&gt; There are a number of political opportunities coming up Dermot.  You know, for many, many years a referendum route wasn’t the chosen route of the Scottish National Party of Scotland, I think a referendum has proven itself to be a wonderful thing, a wonderful participative, enabling, empowering thing.
&gt;
&gt;I think referendums are great, they have been my policy and even I have been surprised by an 85% poll and the degree of public engagement but of course for many years there was a gradual attitude to independence, that is to say you establish a parliament, you establish successfully more powers until you have a situation where you’re independent in all but name and then presumably you declare yourself to be independent, many countries have proceeded through that route.
&gt;
&gt;There is a parliamentary route where people can make their voice heard as well so a referendum is only one of a number of routes.  I think it’s the best route incidentally, that’s always been my opinion but my opinion is only one of many.
&gt;
&gt; What we have learnt from this process over these last few weeks is the power of a grassroots campaign, a campaign of the people, of tens of thousands of people engaging in politics and a lot of politicians – myself included – are going to have to get used to that new reality.  At least I understand that new reality, David Miliband – sorry, Ed Miliband and David Cameron, I don’t think they even understand the question, never understand that reality.

He was not arguing ""we're going to ignore the result and declare independence"", he was point out that the logical conclusion of devo-max is that a country may well find itself extremely close to independence - to the point at which taking that final step is a very small one.",0,1411461078,null,0,false,0,ckq4nt1,t3_2h4os4,t1_ckq4nt1,t1_ckpogrl,null,1426864958,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2

5. Cameron is a very unintelligent man, Osborne is a horrible slimy piece of work, IDS is a lair an idiot and seems to have no human compassion, Farage is a hypocrite.
6. Conservatives want to privatize EVERYTHING in their sight, the NHS, Education, the BBC, Royal Mail... They only see value in something if it is making profit for their mates.

Yea sure, Gerrard played as DM in the second part of last season.

false,LordMondando,null,null,"&gt;Alternatively, the transition from being an integral part of the British Empire to an independent country is a relatively gradual one.
The 1979 devolution referendum got 52% support, the 1997 devolution referendum got 74%.
The 2014 independence referendum got 45% support, who's to say what one in 2030 (for example) might have?

Well on a simple level, economic trends dictate that by 2030, the oil argument simply will not fly as it will be visibly scaling back and Aberdeen especially will be *really* hurting. The same factors will come into play as in Wales. Economic interdepdence on the rest of the country will go up to the point where most poeple don't consider it viable.

It's true what has been said, 1979 might have actually made some sense (specifically a Norwegian model), this time around it failed as the SNP's economics were non-existent because they knew it would be hard and nececarily involve tax raises and social welfare cutbacks. By 2030, not only wil lthe 'blame westmister for everything' line no longer work, when fiscal autonomy far more sigificant. But the arguments for will be 'FUCK THE ENGLISH' and complete autonomy at any cost. 

Given the enviromental challenges we face by then, I think people will prefer unity anyway. 

Not to mention, the older you were (i.e more pension) you had, the more the vote was no, aging population man, only going to get worse. 

&gt;I for one would welcome oil being exhausted, as I think it is an enormous red herring. Scotland doesn't have some window of opportunity where the only possible time it could be independent is in the 70 years that oil is being extracted from the North Sea.

Well, its not that much of a red herring, it was the implicit and rarely seriously examined by yes supporters justificaiton for maintaining or increasing social welfare spending. You can't have a very robust social welfare state without a strong economy after all. 

&gt;We'll have to see what the future brings of course, but bear in mind that ""proper fiscal independence"" has not yet been proposed. What has been proposed is that Scotland can vary income tax by up to 10% from the UK rate - but has to vary all three tax bands in unison (if it wants to raise the higher rate, it has to raise the basic rate).

That's pretty sigificant, stamp tax is also on the table, likely VAT before long. Tax raising powers allow a far more comprehensive ability to budget, you don't get a lot bigger in terms of autonomy. 

&gt;I suspect Westminster will find it hard to implement true fiscal independence, as per devo max, purely because that makes Scotland more likely to be come independent over time rather than less (by far the biggest objection people had this time round was that independence was simply too big a step - devo-max makes that step much, much smaller).

The only real stumbling block is Labour, they are scared shitless of EVEMP's Lib dems will be pro, SNP are pro, Conservatives are pro, for a varying array of Idealogical and pragmatic reasons.

SNP are just banging the drum with rhetoric about how 'its all lies'. It benefits everyone but labour and they are looknig like idiots on this issue with EVEMP's at the moment. 

It's going to happen.

Some discussion points:


**Fullbacks:**

Changed out the fullbacks as both of the first choice ones are pretty new and haven't played a ton of football so I think playing them every game will really burn them out later on in the season. Secondly their role means they are running nearly all game and they probably have put in the most back to back sprints out of anyone. 

Haven't seen Stewart suggested elsewhere yet but had look for any training photos/videos in the last week and saw [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y094Z26zgJw) video which seems to have Stewart (right hand side at 0:20) and Lloyed Jones (seen throughout best look is at 1:51 though) training with the firsts. I could be way off with which players are shown so please correct me if I am wrong.

**Suso:**

There has been rumors of Suso to Milan in January or at the end of the year. I don't want to lose him and I think many on here would agree but at the same time it seems he doesn't have much of a place. I can understand him going but for it to happen without him getting a go this season would really disappoint me. 

Suso is not a pacey winger but he is good on the ball and a good passer. So far this season we have struggled to create chance when the opposition sit back and I think a player like Suso could be good in unlocking these teams.

Look at Chelsea when they've had Lampard as a defensive mid. They'd still look like a brick wall and he's not as good as Gerrard defensively.

It's down to tactics and lack of mental fortitude. If Rodgers knew how to defend we would be solid by now. He's had three years and we still look absolutely dreadful at the back. This while he's had the time to add a few players he's wanted.

The same factors will come into play as in Wales. Economic interdepdence on the rest of the country will go up to the point where most poeple don't consider it viable.

That argument is simply that Scotland couldn't be independent without the rest of the UK to support it - I disagree.

40% of the countries in the EU are Scotland's size or smaller. Denmark is in a very similar position: similar population, similar GDP, about the same length of time left for oil.

Do you think Denmark will become economically unviable once their oil runs out?


&gt;By 2030, not only wil lthe 'blame westmister for everything' line no longer work, when fiscal autonomy far more sigificant. But the arguments for will be 'FUCK THE ENGLISH' and complete autonomy at any cost.

We'll see. I perhaps have more faith in human nature than you do - I don't think anti-English ""at any cost"" sentiments were really a motivating factor for people voting Yes.


&gt;Given the enviromental challenges we face by then, I think people will prefer unity anyway. Not to mention, the older you were (i.e more pension) you had, the more the vote was no, aging population man, only going to get worse.

Of course if future UK governments perform additional Gordon Brown-style [pension raids](http://www.ftadviser.com/2014/05/07/opinion/tony-hazell/savers-could-have-lost-bn-in-brown-s-pensions-raid-WTQAjLW5DSRp9HUxwNZN7K/article.html) then you may find that this demographic's opinions change.

The argument that ""old people vote against independence"" ignores the fact that tomorrow's old people are today's young people. Will generations that have grown up with less of a sense of Britishness, and who may well witness broken promises over devo-max, have the same view as today's pensioners? Probably not.

&gt; Well, its not that much of a red herring, it was the implicit and rarely seriously examined by yes supporters justificaiton for maintaining or increasing social welfare spending. You can't have a very robust social welfare state without a strong economy after all.

I think the argument was simply that while that revenue is available then it could be used to benefit Scotland. But one day, whatever happens, that revenue isn't going to be available.

Scotland's economy is not dependent on it, and Scotland will still be around even after it's gone.

&gt; That's pretty sigificant, stamp tax is also on the table, likely VAT before long. Tax raising powers allow a far more comprehensive ability to budget, you don't get a lot bigger in terms of autonomy.

If all tax powers were devolved then, yes, I agree, it would bring Scotland much closer to devo-max (and in turn much closer to independence in all but name).

I think it's an open question as to if they will be devolved to that extent of course. The current plans for income tax are clearly a poisoned chalice (we'll let you raise revenue by raising the higher rate, while making you be unpopular by forcing you to also raise the basic rate), and none of the three parties agree what - if anything - should be devolved beyond that.

&gt; The only real stumbling block is Labour, they are scared shitless of EVEMP's Lib dems will be pro, SNP are pro, Conservatives are pro, for a varying array of Idealogical and pragmatic reasons.

A short while ago the Scottish Conservatives declared more powers for Scotland to be a ""line in the sand"" that they would never cross, while David Cameron described it as being ""incompatible with being part of the UK"".

It's possible that they've had a change of heart, but I suspect it's more about devolving the minimum possible to keep both Scotland and their traditional supporters happy.

&gt;SNP are just banging the drum with rhetoric about how 'its all lies'. It benefits everyone but labour and they are looknig like idiots on this issue with EVEMP's at the moment.

I think the SNP are currently keeping an open-mind. After the referendum their position has changed from one seeking a referendum to one seeking to take devo-max as far as it can go (and pointing out when a promised timetable slips on its first day is hardly rhetoric about ""it's all lies"").

&gt; I didn't say everyone was, some were. I am Scotish with significant peroids in Scotland under my belt buddy, its not the majority, but it is a thing.

It's a tiny fraction; IMO there are more Union-at-any-cost Rangers supporters than there are ""ethno-nationalists"" in Scotland.

&gt;My point here is simply, given likely trends, it and 'AUTONOMY AT ANY COST' will be the only major ideogical currents for independence within a few years.

I would encourage you to read Marco Biagi's article in [the Scotsman](http://www.scotsman.com/news/marco-biagi-snp-must-now-lead-as-a-government-1-3548061) the other day. This is where the SNP are going:

&gt;Those of us who believe in independence for a purpose rather than in and of itself now must look at how best to achieve that.
&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt;
&gt; So as a party, however much we argue for more powers, it will be the coherent vision of what we intend to do with them that will decide our success in Scotland’s parliament. Together both will ­decide the kind of Scotland created in decades to come.

On a good day when he's not marked the ball goes to Gerrard who sets up our attacks, but with his chances of doing that limited our CB's are the ones putting the ball forwards, or even side to side until Gerrard has enough space.

It's telling that Lovren has (at least he did at the start of the West Ham game, not sure if he still does) the most passes of any of our players so far. With Sturridge out and Mario and Borini not being the fastest it's also been a lot harder to do what we were so good at last season- running in behind, which is where a lot of our attacking impetace has gone too. Allen being out has hit us harder than people realise too.

So I think it's not mecessarily so much our players playing crap, more that the players we have fit at the moment don't necessarily form a team that suits the way BR plays, at least until Sturridge is back.

What I was really 'betting' on was the correlation of the 'pound sterling strength' vs 'population'.

If Scotland voted Yes, to me it is undeniably obvious that sterling would drop a bit, and that many firms would suffer immediately on the back of that vote.  RBS for instance would immediately become a more risky proposition.

As a result, this means that I could take a view on sterling dropping, I did this just spread betting, because I had little money to gamble, if I had more, I'd use options (The right but not the obligation to trade an underlying asset at a pre-agreed price, at a point in time).

Now if my idea of the correlation is correct, that is to say a winning Yes vote fucks the economy a little bit (I can not fathom how that wouldn't happen in the short term) then yes, I had some free money.

1) You have correctly identified that 10 years ago the US and Britain invaded Iraq. You may also have noticed that the political situation is quite different now, with different governments in the US, UK and Iraq and that whereas Iraq in 2003 was fairly stable under a brutal dictator, it is now overrun by crazed Jihadists killing everyone in sight. You may also have noticed that there is now a broad coalition of Arab states all backing the US air strikes.

2) Yes, there is still plenty of money to be made in Iraq and I've no doubt that everyone who wants to make some oil money would prefer a stable, west-friendly Iraq. Coincidentally, most people would also prefer to see an Iraq that wasn't overrun by crazed Jihadists who are murdering everyone in sight, and who want to expand a caliphate to control the whole of the middle-east. 

3) Yes, it was a terrible mistake to invade Iraq. And you're suggesting that because it was a bad idea 10 years ago, rather than trying to intervene and stop a wholesale massacre of hundreds of thousands of people by crazed Jihadists, we should smugly bray about TONY BLIAR!!! and wink knowingly about oil as though you were a panellist on Have I Got News For You in 2005.

In my town last year we had to fight a battle with the local council to prevent a public nature reserve that wasn't technically 'green belt' being built over. In the end they built the new estate further down the road, somewhere the local families don't go to get outside, and I'm totally fine with that.

&gt; The London overcrowding could at least be partially solved by directly taxing companies with offices in London for their share of the environmental and infrastructure burden on the city, perhaps per person they employ within commuter distance. If being in London is so profitable for them they'll find the money.

As to Lovren. When the club goes out and buys Thiago Silva, at that time for record fee, and Marquinhos, for iirc a similar fee, you'd expect them to play. At least there would be pressure from above to let these signings play. Again I didn't watch AC Milan a lot or PSG so I don't know which kind of player Thiago Silva is. Maybe he's too similar to Sakho? Maybe that's the reason why he was picked ahead of him? FACT is: Sakho was very highly rated across Europe and touted to join many top clubs. FACT is: Sakho is a regular for France ahead of Koscielny, Varane etc. FACT is: Sakho is a beast. How come he's not so good now?

The British countryside is eerily, and unnaturally empty. I live in rural Shropshire, and I can drive for miles without passing a single significant settlement. Remember, the UK is one of the most densly populated countries on Earth.

It hasn't always been like this. [Mull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Mull) used to have a population of 12,000 or more, but today fewer than 3,000 people live there. It's the same up and down the country. As I drive around in rural Shropshire, I pass many tiny hamlets, isolated homes, or even crossroads with a place-name but no surviving buildings. Many of these places used to be thriving settlements, before the clearances and enclosures of the C18th tore the rural people from their homes and sent them to the cities. (Where they became ""city fuckers"" as you so picturesquely describe them.)

I used to feel the same way as you: How terrible to have more people come in and spoil the rural idyll. But there is no rural idyll, just the ghosts of all these people torn from their homes, and the unnatural emptiness they left behind.

""English votes for English laws"" is unsustainable within a UK parliament context because:

* Governments will be returned without a majority of English MPs, meaning that they will have no control over matters such as health and education anywhere in the UK.
* The West Lothian Question will not be *solved* so much as *reversed*, so long as the Barnett formula applies. Barnett allocates funding based on population share and the level of public spending in England, so budget cuts in England necessarily force cuts in the budgets of the devolved administrations. In this sense there are no ""English only"" matters, and barring MPs from the rest of the UK from voting on most domestic issues will only lead to budget cuts being forced on the devolved administrations without any sort of say being given to the rest of the UK.

Such a ""solution"" also does nothing to recognise political heterogeneity within England. We've heard often during this referendum campaign that the North of England has more in common, politically speaking, with Scotland than the South-east. Why not recognise that, and establish proper regional assemblies across England?",0,1411470155,null,0,1411470450,0,ckq6681,t3_2h7qhn,t1_ckq6681,t3_2h7qhn,null,1426864240,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

The education system is the single best example of why the Assembly simply can't be trusted with any more powers. All parties agreed that they didn't want the 11+ transfer test and voted to scrap it. None of the parties have been able to agree on what should replace it. That was 7 years ago. In those 7 years the government has still failed to make a decision on how it should be replaced.

In the absence of leadership the top schools took it upon themselves to reinstate the 11+ under a different name and privately run by the schools themselves. The government threatened them over this for a couple of years but now seem to have just given up on even doing that. So for 7 years the country hasn't had a formal process for transferring from primary school to secondary school but instead uses an informal process privately set up and run by the schools themselves because the government is too incompetent to do anything about it.

The first part I can partially understand. There are people in need of free or subsidised housing. They shouldn't have to live on the street. The housing should have a minimum hygiene and safety standard (although the size and quality level is open to argument. I personally don't think council accommodation *should* be particularly comfortable, merely clean and functional, but again, another discussion for another time).

But the second bit, the location. Why does it have to be in an incredibly expensive place? I'm sure the houses/flats could be bigger, better and cheaper in many other places in the country.

&gt; If more land is likely to be required for development, the question arises of where it would
be most environmentally sustainable to develop. Certain areas are in need of particular protection.
This includes those currently protected by a number of important land use designations, including
Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (15.6 per cent of total land in England), National Parks (7.6
per cent) and Sites of Special Scientific Interest (8.2 per cent). A survey conducted for this Review
confirms that these are areas that people would most like to see free of development (see Chart 1
below). Further, the recent Stern Review drew attention to the issues around developing in areas that
may be at longer-term risk from flooding

So assuming that 10% of total land is already developed, and 30% is ring fenced for environmental reasons, that leaves 60% of England (I'm assuming these figures are for England only). As the report points out you have flooding-prone areas and sheer hillsides and other areas which aren't suitable for building on. But let's say for arguments sake you had to double our existing housing stock over the next century we'd still be using just 20% of total land mass with plenty left over for wildlife and farmland.

Another issue is that we need houses where the jobs are, and we also need shops, schools etc near the houses, and roads, rail links, water supplies and so forth, so it's not just a simple exercise in how much space is occupied by a two-up two-down semi.

Of course an expert in planning/environment (or even basic arithmetic) should weigh in at this point as there's no doubt huge details missing in these back of the envelope calculations.

I'll bet you were told or led to believe that the Scots get an unfair chunk of cash and everyone is awesomely nice to them cos they keep demanding money so they can give people free education. Yeah?

Nope.

Not true. Total horse shit. 

They spend their share on whatever they want. The important bit is their 'share'.

Here's how it works:

I have 100. You have 100.

I want to spend 10 on education so I'm left with 90.

You want to spend 40. Leaving you with 60.

Can I turn around and say I had to give you 30 more than you needed cos you were greedy? 

err... no. not really.

The differences in educational spending is because the Scottish pay for it out of their 'share' and Westminster can't be assed paying for Englands.

Westminster in fact thinks it's a great idea just to sell your education to private companies so the year after instead of spending £10 like they normally would they'll only have to spend £5 (and you get landed with a 9K student fee).

false,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"Housing in London is a huge problem with multiple intractable causes. It would be beneficial to try to move some of the economy out of London, but that's easier said than done.

Your point about location makes sense, and lots of people move to find work or reduce their housing costs. I think it's trumped by a few other considerations:

* In the case of these specific people, why should they need to move when there are social housing properties standing empty?

* In the case of people who are looking for work, moving them away from their network of contacts might make it more difficult. (I don't blame  people who aren't looking for work: unskilled work is in decline and it's not coming back. We need to learn to live with large scale unemployment. But again maybe that's a discussion for another time.)

* In the case of people with kids, moving them away from their support networks of friends and relatives may reduce their opportunities. 

* You mention the injustice of house prices and rents in the SE. If local authorities and housing associations are allowed to cash out and sell their housing stock, we'll end up in a situation where people on a low income can't afford to live in whole large areas. That has a whole bunch of negative consequences.

One option is that we stop paying housing benefit and let the market sort it out: businesses based in central London will have to start paying  a realistic rate for their unskilled workers. I'm concerned that this would lead to a race to the bottom. 

My own solution is that we build lots more social housing. This will help in many places but won't be the whole answer in London.

But the truth is the opposite of that, people were simply fooled into voting for the opposite of what they actually wanted. And while that seems to be a legitimate thing to do in a referendum, it does by no means mean that people actually voted for the thing they wanted - only that people voted for the thing that they thought they wanted while being completely misinformed about what it all meant.

So yes it's a binding democratic vote, but it just leaves us with the usual disillusionment, low voter turnout, people complaining (quite rightly) that voting doesn't make any difference... because in truth a whole lot of votes DON'T make any difference under FPTP. And so we're left with our shitty sub-par democracy - one that was once an example to the world is now an example to our worldly peers of how *not* to run a democracy.

There's a reason why no one using AV or PR ever have a referendum on moving to FPTP - because it would have near zero support, as it would be a step in the wrong direction. Absolutely *no one* would dream of proposing such a referendum, supporting it if that did happen, or voting Yes for it.

false,Dirkinator,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"This questions been debated quite a bit. People seem a bit split down the middle on this. 

Answer a: it's Gallifrey. The Doctor turned off the safety locks on the Tardis, allowing something that had previously been impossible. The psychic interface brought him to his own past. He never actually gets out of the Tardis and so doesn't cross his own time stream. The events of the last season saw that Gallifrey was able to send help into our universe in the form of a new cycle of regenerations, so the ""time lock"" isn't as secure as it once was... The Doctor was unconscious so it's possible he's simply never thought to try it since he regenerated.

Answer b: it's not Gallifrey. It's the same Barn from Day of the Doctor, one that is on a planet that is not Gallifrey. Supposedly the sky seen in listen does not match the atmosphere of Gallifrey, according to some. The theory here is that the Gallifreyans can and do live on other planets than Gallifrey, which is how the TARDIS can take Clara there, because its not time locked. People also point out that when the entire sky is swarming with Daleks and the surface is being bombed to shit, the war doctor is seen standing under a calm and sunny sky, suggesting its not Gallifrey. The counter argument to that is that a huge planet could have areas where the destruction isn't seen, especially away from cities like the Barn.

There is an answer c: poor writing. Moffat may have written something that contradicts events set up in earlier stories.

Myself, I lean towards answer b. it's the one that makes the most sense given the circumstances. I hope they address it in the future so we have a definite answer rather than a debate",0,1411476756,null,0,false,0,ckq7tfv,t3_2h7uy7,t1_ckq7tfv,t3_2h7uy7,null,1426863474,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Less Bishops is a good idea, but the Lords Spiritual should remain. I believe they should actually extend it to include other faiths too, ranging from other important Christian faiths in the UK like the Church of Scotland, and different faiths that are well represented in the UK such as Islam. 

There is certainly a tough problem in deciding which religions receive representation, and to what extent (perhaps decided by the size of the population identifying with that faith). This is worthwhile though. Even though people are increasingly losing their faith, religion is still massively important in the nation.

Forget what it is called. I wish I'd never said miniseries as the name for whatever it is is totally irrelevant. It could be called anything or nothing at all, because the name for it is unimportant.

My point is that whatever you want to call it, British TV writers have been doing this long-form style of writing where one single story is split across multiple episodes for a long time before Miracle Day.

You want another example where it happened? The second season of Auf Wiedersehen, Pet. That took an established, episodic show and then instead of carrying it on, instead turned the second season into a ""one long mission where it was now decidedly non-episodic"". It was also roughly the same length in terms of minutes and episodes. That was over 20 years ago now.

Miracle Day is not anything new. THE NAME IS UNIMPORTANT, WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT LONG-FORM, NON-EPISODIC TELEVISION WRITING, WHERE ONE SINGLE STORY IS SPLIT ACROSS MANY EPISODES HAS EXISTED FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. Do you get it now, or do you keep wanting to be ignorant and try to pin a name to it, or derail the point with trying to ignore the bit I put in caps?

Once you've stopped trying to pin a name to it, answer me this: Why does Miracle Day (or anything) have to be new/unique in order to get acclaim? Why can't it rest on fantastic characters, dramatic scenes, believable dialogue and amazing storytelling? Because I'd personally rather watch something done before done better (as this did), than simply something new that doesn't have those things. So what if they'd done the same thing that's been done before - they did it BETTER, and after decades of long-form single stories split across multiple episodes, to come out on top of all of them, that is more than a high achievement in itself.
