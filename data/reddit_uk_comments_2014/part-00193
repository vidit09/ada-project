&gt;So as you can see, there are pretty vast differences.

The difference in details are vast but the **root issue** is exactly the same thing, ""social punishment"" for a ""victimless crime"". 

 


Illegality is a ""social punishment"", just backed up by law. 

Gay sex used to be illegal. Sleeping with multiple partners used to be illegal. Sex outside wedlock used to be illegal. The illegality is a social punishment backed up by law.... In this case the social punishment was public shaming backed up by media outlets.

   

 



I am not making parallels. I am stating that they are exactly the same thing. Not ""like"" or ""similar"" but exactly the same.


  


You are right....The ""social punishment"" is different, the ""victimless crime"" is different. But they are the same thing.

Look...The way I see it. (i hope I can articulate myself too.... text is a funny format)... The way I see it, you can strike at the branches or attack the root. The root is clearly ""social punishment"" for a ""victimless crime"" in this case.  As... it's the same root issue as a person drinking Alcohol in Saudi Arabia or a person having homosexual sex in Uganda...etc.. (the list of crimes is long and the punishment ranges from death to slight shaming)


**You are right**.... The argument I made will appear weaker to people who hate drugs ( authoritarians who think legal = ethical......... law should never be challenged ... ""drugs are bad mmmkayyy"", ""I'll have a pint of Guinness please"" ) But... **that is their problem, they have to face reality** .... they are the ones supporting ""social punishment"" for a ""victimless crime"". *""Oh...but but but it's illegal""* doesn't change the facts.(Killing Gays in SA is NOT ok because it's illegal to be Gay in SA) 

 

I do get where you are coming from. Though... hopefully I have convinced you that they are exactly the same thing, the details of the ""social punishment"" and the ""victimless crime"" are just different.

It's not our philosophy and probably a bit irrational, but I'd love to see us fork up a massive bid to bring in a world class replacement. Doing things the right way and not overpaying/spending absurd amounts of cash is great, don't get me wrong, but I can't see any amount of ""good"" or ""really good"" players that we can bring in to fill the gap Suarez is leaving us. 

I'm hopeful that we can bring in a top talent, and if we don't I feel like we're taking a step back next season. Guys like Origi, Markovic and Can might be great for us one day, but if we lose a step and drop out of the CL next season we all know what that means.

Yeah, he is. That's what makes him so much fun to watch. For similar passion and follow-through, watch Coleman, McCarthy, and Oviedo. I also see McGeady consistently playing with similar thirst, but he didn't hit his stride until late last season.

&gt; Can we please get Lukaku?…Please?

Eh, to be honest, I don't know that he's exactly what we need. I remember him as being pretty streaky last season; he was incredible for a few matches, and completely invisible in others. He also *cannot turn with the damn ball*. Can't stress that enough. I can't even tell you how many times he'd have the ball with his back to goal and would give it away easily or just shuffle around until it was taken from him. He's a lot of fun to watch and I have a ton of respect for him (he speaks five languages and understands six.

There is a slight risk of damage to health, of course, and there may well be reason to mildly admonish those involved for that reason, but what drives the uniform chorus of public outrage is not this, otherwise such hazardous feats as climbing between balconies would have attracted much more opprobrium. Every summer many people are injured attempting this craziness while drunk, and some ten or twenty even die. That really *is* shocking. (See [this video](http://vimeo.com/98757267) about 44 minutes in).

The outrage in this case, however, is clearly attached to the sexual nature of the action, both by those who slut-shame the woman and by those who condemn the men. Those who condemn the men share the view that cock-sucking is bad but attribute agency solely to the men. There is, however, no particular reason to condemn the men any more than the woman, even by the standards of the morally prurient. 

In fact, if the issue is consent, then the girl seemed more than enthusiastic in her consenting, even to the point of initiating the entire proceeding. Organizers say she wasn't even asked to suck cocks, just to make [""the wildest video in two minutes""](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/07/04/magaluf-girl-mamading-video-unrepentant-firm-performed-sex-acts-choice_n_5557467.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-news). Less than enthusiastic were some of the men, one of whom couldn't get his flies open in time, and almost none of whom appeared fully erect. 

No one has asked whether the men were intoxicated, or whether all of them had reached the age of consent. Think of what happens if some of them had not. The woman was committing child abuse. In forty years time, when Emily Gaythwaite is an old woman, perhaps she will be prosecuted as a vile pervert. Will those shrill moralists of today still find voice to condemn if the boys finally find the courage to come forward? The victims are always to be believed, don't you know.

While initially I thought it was just bias, I noticed that almost all (if not all) of those adverts contained at least one clip of a Spurs player or Spurs as a team... After wiping away the bias and realizing that statistically, yes, there were indeed more Spurs clips than any other team in the adverts. Not only that, there wasn't much of the scum... Also at the time, Bale was still at Spurs, and a lot of reports were still suggesting he'd stay, amidst all the Real pressure and heavy bids. It wasn't until very late August that it actually seemed like he'd leave (of course, you know, apart from the fact that we broke our transfer purchase fee *twice* during that window. I remember reading a top comment here that said, ""We are spending the Bale money."" anyways)

Not only that! (!) but I noticed that Spurs were on NBCSN more often than not during the season. During Survival Sunday, they certainly weren't featured, which is fair because why would they be, but even if there were higher profile matches going on, Spurs would be on NBCSN probably 60% of the time. Just enough to give them coverage and make sure there's no *clear* bias.

If NBC actually swears by this poll, then the bias is clear.

I hate to break it to you but 'recently became homeless' is not equivelent to functioning. It's the first step to permamently rough living, and start of a slippery slope to rock bottom.

Your family are making a smart move; an addict is an addict. You are allowing your brother to exploit your cousin. 

If your brother gets in shit, be it a car accident, missing a tax return, or forgetting to renew insurance he's going to bring down your cousin with him, and she really doesn't sound like she needs that aggravation. Not only that, but you're inciting fraud, and you could get in shit for it too.

You need to get your brother help dealing with his addiction instead of helping him find loopholes so he can continue functioning around his addiction.

As long as you're helping him get away from the problems, you're convincing that addicted part of his mind that he's actually perfectly fine living on the drug as long as he can find ways around it. Don't let an addict justify their addiction.

It won't be easy. He might lose his job. He might lose his car. But he will also lose the addiction, and that will give him a chance to rebuild his life. He's got a unique opportunity here where he can actually afford the help he needs.

Funny story how I became a Spurs fan. I friend of mine had asked me what my favourite soccer team was. I didn't have one at the time I was following TFC and my dad was a big Barcelona fan but I wasn't into English soccer. We were at lunch and the guys next to we're talking about basketball, so I mixed the two up and I said my favourite team were the Spurs (San Antonio Spurs for you outsiders) then he told me he was an arsenal fan and started talking shit about all these players I had never heard of. I though to myself what the hell is a Gareth bale sure enough I googled it wondering why a soccer team in England had beef with a basketball team in Texas. Sure enough I learned it was its team blah blah blah still hadn't gotten into English soccer. Rewind three months later I'm at my cousins house watching Manchester City vs QPR final game of the season and I thought to myself holy sweet monkey balls that's the greatest game I have ever watched, and decided then next year I would get into it. Sure enough I picked spurs I had heard they had hired a Portuguese as there manger (I am part Portuguese) they had loads of talent so I committed to them.

&gt;1.You are employing some one for a job that does not meet national &gt;minimum wage requirement of £6.31, which is illegal, great to see &gt;Edinburgh Uni throwing that one out there.

The key point here is the term ""employing."" As just about everyone else has pointed out, OP is not looking to hire anyone for anything. Participants are volunteers. It is as simple as that. The study which OP has submitted has been approved by the University and passed an [ethics review](http://www.psy.ed.ac.uk/psy_research/research_ethics.php) (as all studies conducted at the University of Edinburgh must). The study you proposed in the comments below is dubious in its research aims and I doubt it would pass such a review. Also, I am a little unclear as to what The University of Edinburgh  has thrown out there, would you care to elaborate?

&gt;2 The amount of money you are offering is ridiculous normal studies &gt;start off at £20 per hour &amp; that is for more than one petty hour, £5 is &gt;a total joke and not even worth the most bored over 50's time.

The time frame is quoted is 20-30 minutes, it's not an hour so OP is actually offering £10 an hour, though as you quite rightly pointed out, the minimum unit of employment is 1(one) hour. However, as indicated above this is not employment but rather volunteering and as such is exempt. You indicate that most studies pay £20 minimum and last longer than one hour. I would be most interested in a citation as to where you are getting those figures from. 

&gt;3 Get real.

I believe OP was being sincere, the burden would be on you to prove that she is not being ""real."" 

&gt;4 The only way that I could see anyone turning up is if you find &gt;someone working at a retirement home for people with dementia who &gt;manages to get a bus load of the old yins to your doorstep in &gt;exchange for £500.

You clearly state that this is your opinion and provide no rationale as to why you think it is the case. I put it to you that many people 50+ are willing to participate in such studies without payment solely to help advance medical research. 

I await your well reasoned and hate speech free response.

Thought I should include a couple of disclaimers here that I posted on the map's photostream page:

1. The meanings provided on the map should be taken with a pinch of salt. There is a very good chance that at least a few of the more obscure etymologies I've included in the map are erroneous. Multiple completing etymologies exist for a number of place names in Wales. Gwynedd, for example, here given as ""Land of the Wild People"", is derived from Proto Irish **Weidh-n-*, via Old Irish *Féni* and Brythonic *Vened*- to give Welsh Gwynedd. Or, perhaps, it isn't. Perhaps it's derived from the Pictish tribal name *Venicones* - Gwynedd's semi-mythical founders. Perhaps it's derived from Old Irish *fían*, meaning ""war band"". Perhaps none of these explanations are correct.
 
2. The map is, as of yet, unfinished. There are quite a few river names on the map (Gele, Mawddach, Aeron, Ogwr/Ogmore, Honddu, Tawe and Hafren/Severn), that I haven't been able to find any information on. If anyone can suggest a likely derivation, please let me know. If there are any towns or villages that I've left out and you would like to see included, get in touch! I think I've got room for a few more.

Finally, please note that this map contains etymologies of WELSH LANGUAGE names only. If the Welsh and English names for a given place differ, only the derivation of the Welsh name is given. Sorry, Port Talbot!

I know this sub will down-vote me and all for my opinion, but that's the best signing that anyone will make this season.

If there is one man in this world who could take United back to the top, it's him. Just look at his record - won the title with two clubs in the Netherlands, won the CL with Ajax, won the title multiple times in Spain with Barcelona and gave them a structure to build upon, while giving debuts to so many of their legends, won the title in Germany with Bayern Munich and gave them a structure to build upon as well. And now he's by far the best manager in the World Cup, prepared for every situation, and never afraid to do what's best for the team (so no Rooney's, or anyone else's, tantrums anymore, unless they want to get fucked up).

Tardis goes where she pleases. Simple as that. Queen. 

Cyberman only do things in a straight forward motion, just like rooks. 

Angel, (why would you make such an image) move about without trying to be seen, corner to corner. Bishop.

I'm tired of everyone sucking LVG's popsicle. he switched a keeper for pens. is that the first time that's happened? no. is that something they did on a whim? no. they would obviously have known beforehand that if it went to penalties, they'd switch keepers. and who have they bought? they've spent nearly 80m pounds on two teenagers! hate to tell you this manc, vidal's not walking through that door. your squad is still the same squad that finished 7th and you have no semblance of a style and no indication of any improvement all season. meanwhile, LVG had Holland whomp spain, who sucked all tournament. they beat chile, which was their best win of the WC so far. they had a scare against AUS. they needed two very late goals to beat Mexico, a team only in the WC by the grace of Graham Zusi. and they went to pens against Costa Rica, the worst team in the final 8. aside from a game or two, Holland has played shit football. the only exception is Robben and some flashes of brilliance from a few others. if LVG is so boss, he'll bench RVP next game because not only was RVP wasting clear cut chances, he was also blocking dutch shots on goal! when he starts huntelaar next game, then i'll be impressed.

Chelsea and city were always going to spend and strengthen. they do it every year. but what did they get? Chelsea added more in the MF and Costa, but unless Jose changes his tactics, Costa is going to be the next body buried in the Chelsea striker graveyard. city are going to be good again, just like always.

nobody is going to give us the title, we're going to have to earn it. this isn't la liga mate, we're going to have to beat some good teams. will we win the title? probably not. but we're in for a shout at the moment.

now to your points about Liverpool. we are weakened without suarez, sure. but he didn't score that many big goals, so those can be replaced. what will hurt us is his creativity in setting up chances and the attention that defenses had to pay, which freed up other players. if we bring in some good, interchangeable pieces like Shaqiri, Markovic, griezman, etc. and combine them with danny, Raheem, lallana, and coutinho, we are going to give defenses fits with our movement and interchanging. we can't replace suarez straight up, but we can replace certain aspects of him, get better as a team, and play good team football, and we will be fine. we scored 101 goals last year and didn't win the league. there have literally been nearly 100 teams that have won the English top flight title without scoring that many. we will be fine.

true,robdabank,JE,jersey,"World cup has been exciting, lots of goals in the group stage. No real upsets in the Ro16, and all the clubs in the Semi Finals are sort of expected to be there.

Spain flamed out of the World Cup in the group stages, so did Ivory Coast, Italy, and England.

Spain got BTFO in their opening game against the Netherlands 4-1.

Portugal got BTFO  in their opening game against Germany 4-0.

Mexican GK and Free Agent Guillermo Ochoa made a crazy save against Brazil.

Tim Howard is now an American hero and broke a World Cup Record for saves.

Goalkeeping has been really good this world cup

Xherdan Shaqiri scored the first left-footed hat trick in world cup history against Honduras.

The U.S. played well, exceeded expectations I think.

It's really hot in Brazil, couple enforced water breaks in games because of the heat. Particularly in Manaus.

Suarez bit someone again, 4 month ban from all football including Liverpool games at the start of the season.

Belgium played poor against Argentina and got bumped in the quarter finals.

Lukaku wasn't used for a few games, Wilmots played Origi instead. He set up the first goal and scored a brace against the US in the QFs.

Neymar injured his spine in the quarter final game against Colombia, he's out for the rest of the tournament.

Chile almost knocked out Brazil.

Costa Rica could have knocked out The Netherlands, van Gaal brought in Tim Krul for penalties and he sort of psyched out a bunch of their players.

**Club**

**Transfers in:**

Fabregas - £27m was signed in June

Diego Costa's buyout clause was met - £32m on July 1

true,retroshark,cnty-england,England,"i dont get DLA. i missed the deadline to apply for the old system by a few weeks, and am stuck with ESA and an ongoing assessment for PIP, the system im told has replaced DLA. honestly it all is quite overwhelming seeing as the council originally granted me the bedroom tax exemption and allowed me to look at renting a place myself. only after i signed a rental agreement did the council turn around and tell me that they could not grant the exemption now because i was not already in receipt of PIP, and even if i was, id have to be assessed at the highest level of PIP benefit in order to get the exemption i had previously been awarded based off of my medical evidence and doctors statements alone. So now I am stuck waiting to see if PIP will give me anything, because after this month my LHA goes from the ""ermergency"" £193 pw to only £86. my rent is about 210 a week and im already falling very short. if my LHA exemption is not upheld, regardless of getting PIP assistance, ive been told by the council that ill have to make use of the handy break clause in the rental agreement, because they will not cover it after explicitly telling me and my advocate present at both meetings I would be ""pre-exempted from""

its all bullshit and makes me very angry/worried/upset that i was mislead several times that only once i had signed a rental agreement that the council could put their original offer in writing. needless to say that somehow the notes and paperwork i signed in the meetings prior to signing my rental agreement ""dissappeared"" and they could not support the earlier decision to grant exemption. it really is a fucked up situation as im already on shaky ground deceiving my landlord to even be able to rent here. 

ill look into what you mentioned, but i doubt i will meet the criteria for a severe disability premium, but i will find out what i can. this new system of bennefits is even more complex and difficult to navigate than before. now the 40+ page DLA application i stressed over filling out for weeks seems like a good alternative compared to all these bonus benefit packages and various schemes i have to apply for just to meet my basic needs.

Now for this to even happen this person (or group of people?) would need to have access to mass media.  The internet is good and all but the majority of people we need to bring this information to are sitting infront of the tv every evening, and the news can be quite selective.  This is a very difficult medium to gain access to, as it is tightly controlled for obvious reasons.

To convince the masses though..

People need to feel afflicted for them to act, the problem is the subtle changes that occur year in and year out which take a tiny piece at a time do not resonate with the people.  It is like the toad being brought to the boil scenario.  We need someone to poke the toad, but for the right motivations.

I believe the changes that would be brought about by such a person/group should be open and transparent to the population affected and i also think the population involved should be consulted, which is something that can not be carried out on a short time scale, and only after the truth has been told.

Chances are though, we could end up with a interim government which nobody voted for and a long power struggle followed possibly by civil war.  That is if the middle east is any thing to be considered.

Different plug types can be fitted but the bulky psu remains. Though the proposal is good, the designer didn't meet their initial aims by coming up with a design compatible with the macbook air (which would require replacing apple's proprietary cable altogether), though that's not at all an issue with the design itself. But considering how all laptop mains adaptors have fairly chunky psus on them, not just the apple one, even with a more slimline plug on the end they're still bulky pieces of kit, so is it really of much help in these cases?

A design like this has its problems, having so many moving parts means many points of failure, a step down from our sturdy design at present.

She told me to pick someone else in the same league and not be Barca or Real Madrid so I was scrolling through and I came across this team, Tottenham Hotspur. I was like huh. I'll use these guys. Teams came onto the field, we started playing (Let's just say she crushed me. I have 2 younger brothers but at the time, they didn't play video games so I didn't really know what they were) I enjoyed the team (Especially Ledley King. He was an absolute beast from what I remember) and everytime I went over, we stole her brothers ps2 and played FIFA. Skip ahead 2 years I'm 16. At this point I've given up on Hockey, all the hockey players at my school were total dick wads so was never dating one of those people, I met this boy lets just call him Tim. Tim was a very excellent soccer player who was destined for NCAA soccer (college soccer, basically U21 before pro) and he really loved Liverpool. So there I was at his house on Sunday afternoon watching soccer with him and I see Tottenham was playing. I was like oh! I know these guys! We watched the whole game and they won (can't remember any of it, bad memory but they won by a lot) and I just fell in love with the team.

true,retroshark,cnty-england,England,"you are absolutely correct. foresight, planning, transparency and involvement of the greater public are essential. 

still though, in my mind there is a very large demographic of people who know not what they are truly angry about, but will damn well pick up arms and fight the fight anyway. look at the madness that ensued during the riots a few years back. sure, looting and stealing were the most likely reasons, but a large mass of otherwise unconnected individuals got together and certainly made a scene. its those people who i feel could be most instrumental in this kind of movement. every rebellion or uprising needs muscle of some kind. im not talking a group of people that can be scapegoated at the end of the unrest, but rather a group who could be motivated by little or nothing at all but used to brilliant effect. 

like i said before, i dont think there are enough issues as we know of them, which would help to galvanise a very eclectic nation. this is why i believe that waiting to find the right issue, the right scandal or the right figure to lead this movement will ultimately just stand to slow down possible progress. it is the most simple demands and issues that when made by enough people bring about the most change. 

when protesters marched on washington in protest of the vietnam war, there was little need for complexities as to why the war was unjust, unamerican or uncivilised. it was enough that enough wars had already taken place that the people knew the ultimate truth that another war would solve nothing. Looking at the civil rights movement, although more complex, it still faced one major issue which was the segregation of Black's in america. there were deeper issues like the police corruption and the jim crow laws and all that... but it was all secondary to the greater issue of equality in american society. 

i feel that the more we look to galvanise ourselves, the more we will end up splintering off into special interest groups and causes. we need basic fundamental ideas here, it need not be too complex. 

i completely agree with all that you say, and as a thinker, i know that what you say is true, but in my gut, where these feelings of anger and hatred are born i feel the biggest appeal to the people can be made. we all know that things are very very wrong with this country. we all know that politicians and power elites are getting away with murder at the very least. we all know something has to be done but nobody really knows what. to me it seems more than ever that only a basic human response can be used to solve these most basic issues in our society - the lust for power and money, what the power and money are allowed to do to people and that complete and utter disregard for the every-man who is caught up in an almost constant avalanche of scandals, political inquiry, bribery, debauchery and almost complete disregard for every law, ideal and philosophy laid out by even the earliest of philosophers and political minds. none of these are new issues, many of them in fact are referenced in our oldest forms of written or oral histories. it seems so obvious what the problems are, so why not the most obvious of solutions?

personally, i do not want to see the state of europe become that of the current middle-east. i do not wish for civil war but at the same time, i dont truly believe that it would be a factor. i dont even see the political system as inherantly bad, just those that already hold positions of power holding the ability to usher in new members to their secret clubs and fraternities only to continue to perpetuate the same government racketeering we have seen throughout our history. i feel that simply stopping and removing every person involved in all levels of government and replacing them with new alternatives that the greater and more specific issues such as how political oversight, internal or external monitoring of the workings of these systems can actually be addressed. 

i know i am not the wordsmith i would like to be, but i think all of that makes some sense. i just see the issues as too many in number to address in any kind of reasonable manner, that is until massive political shakeup has been achieved and those responsible for the current state of affairs to be ousted from government positions indefinitely. its upon this new foundation, even one only meant to be temporary, can a new system be built. regardless of any greater ideals, we need a system, and the system can in fact work FOR us. we just need to lay the foundations for the new system in such a way that we will not be constantly building on the unstable ground that is currently extant and available to build on.  we need to create new societal real-estate, as the current planning is so cluttered and dilapidated that no work could ever be accomplished without the entire map being levelled first.

I can see our '3rd string' CB's like Coates and Ilori (provided they aren't sold/loaned) playing the early rounds of League/FA cup depending on the teams we're drawn against.

2.  I think selling Agger would be a mistake. The man has YNWA tattooed on his knuckles ffs. However if he does go, then obviously are shoddy defense will take a blow unless we replace him with quality.

3. We all do. Look at Markovic, he runs back to play defense and win the ball back and Sterling does that too. The club is always targeting versatile players.

4. I think with Suarez gone, we will concede less goals. I think we will go to a 4-3-3 instead of a 4-4-2 diamond and we'll be more defensively disciplined. I'm actually very excited to see how we play without him. I think we won't be scoring 4-5 goals every other game again but I can still see us with plenty of threat with Sturridge/Sterling/Markovic up front and support from midfield Lallana/Coutinho/Henderson.

true,riglet,null,null,"1. I think Brendan will stick with Skrtel and Sakho next season, just because that is the combination he preferred at the end of last season when all centre backs were fit. I think in the long term he'll be looking to put sakho and lovren together as those are the two who are coming up to the peaks of there career, being 24 and 25 respectively. So I'll think we'll see lovren being used in rotation next season, with a view to being a first teamer the season after. 

2. I'm still a big fan of Agger, but it seems brendan is not as at the end of last season when we were pushing for the title, he stuck with sakho even though he and skrtel had a poor defensive record together. I think eventually that combination will get stronger, especially with better full backs on either side but if agger goes we seriously need those two to stop shipping goals, and for the centre backs on the bench to be reliable eg not kicking the ball straight to the other teams striker!

3. If by wing defensive play you mean full backs then yes, reinforcement is needed. Flanagan played great last season but I think I'm not 100 percent on him being a first teamer just yet. Kelly seems to be nowhere right now, and Johnson has been frankly shite the last couple of seasons. Hopefully Enrique can come back strongly and some young lads like Wisdom and Robinson can be folded in but I think a new full back is needed.

4. Suarez helped us defend from the front, and was a big part of us closing down teams in midfield aswell last year, especially in *that* aresnal game. But without him, the rest of the team is just as willing to put a shift in and our signings so far, Lallana especially, seem willing runners, so hopefully it wont be a massive problem",0,1404776390,null,0,false,0,cir3vu7,t3_2a3ehh,t1_cir3vu7,t3_2a3ehh,null,1434600379,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Reina's biggest weaknesses were his errors, and aerial ability. Mignolet does not improve either of these. Mignolet has slightly better reflexes, but made more errors from crosses/high balls.

Having watched Napoli closely this season, Reina was very good overall but he still made those ridiculous mistakes which seem to come from nowhere, such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPbhV58M16A). Maybe he's lost his edge, his concentration levels are questionable.

In the long run it doesn't make sense to keep Reina given his wages and that he is declining, but I think it is important to recognise Mignolet's limitations. 

I really would look to sign a young keeper to push him because I think we can do better.

&gt;The __National Flag of India__ is a horizontal rectangular tricolour of [deep saffron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron_(color\)#Deep_saffron), [white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White) and [India green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variations_of_green#India_green); with the *[Ashoka Chakra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoka_Chakra)*, a 24-spoke wheel, in blue at its centre. It was adopted in its present form during a meeting of the [Constituent Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituent_Assembly) held on 22 July 1947, when it became the official flag of the [Dominion of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_of_India). The flag was subsequently retained as that of the Republic of India. In India, the term ""[tricolour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricolour_(flag\))"" ([Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_language): तिरंगा, Tirangā) almost always refers to the Indian national flag. The flag is based on the *Swaraj* flag, a flag of the [Indian National Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress) designed by [Pingali Venkayya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingali_Venkayya).

First off.  Modern feminism can be highly ideological.  Some feminists claim it is simply about equal rights for women, which is fair enough, but there are also many feminists who push highly divisive gender theories.  And that's their right, but it doesn't mean it should be taught in schools.

This push to 'teach boys how to be feminists' certainly seems to be of the more ideological kind.  It appears to be based on the contentious theory that boys are raised to hate women and that there's a widespread culture of misogyny, in which  men tolerate violence against women.  (Also, see claims about the existence of a 'rape culture'.)

I think my position on this is the same as my attitude to religion.  Believe in anything you want, but please stop trying to indoctrinate children, especially in state-schools.

and

&gt;Abdull said the beast was a white Scottish male, in his mid 30s, around 5ft 11in and of medium build.

&gt;He was wearing a blue hat and dark blue clothing. The predator had the letters “LOVE” tattooed in dark green ink on the knuckles of his right hand.

amazing how at 2am in pitch blackness, no lights and all these fine details of the attackers are known.

almost like a made up PR story. like some of George Zimmerman 'hero' news events they staged to make him look good.

'George rushes to the scene of a car crash with fire extinguisher in hand'

forgetting the fact the pretend fire was already out and George was late to the 'crash'

&gt;“I fly-kicked him in the face and knocked him out.”

and the attacker didn't die or get a broken neck, a miracle.

Now if the story just said he pulled him off her and shouted at the attacker, the attacker then ran off.

that would be believable, but they have added too much details to pad out the story, that screams made-up, and a PR piece.

There's an audio story called ""Project: Lazurus"" that has the sixth doctor and the seventh doctor in it together, but separated in world time by dozens of years, in doctor time by hundreds. But with that, you might just cut it when 7 shows up and listen to the rest when you get to pre-1995 7. 

But then you have Charlotte pollard and DI Menzies. See, Charley travelled with 8 for freaking forever, then was stranded on a planet, and 6 answers her SOS. So she goes with him, but the episodes only mean things to the listener if you've already met 8. So then Charley and 6 meet Menzies, and do two adventures with her. Charley eventually leaves 6, and 6 forgets her and moves on. However, earlier in 6's time stream, he had met Menzies, who helped him track down an old companion, Thomas Brewster, who then went back to wreak havoc on the 5th doctor. 

In ""Nowhere Place"" the sixth doctor says ""when you think about it, all time happens at once"" or something similar. That's the approach you have to do for doctor who. Some episodes depend on what the viewer knows, some on what the doctor knows, some on what people in the doctors life knows.

The first episode seems to be a mix between Sweeney Todd, Jack the Ripper and the robots from Girl in the Fireplace. Tons of references to past episodes and quite funny in places. It's not amazing but it is decent. 

The second episode reminds me of the Rick and Morty episode where they go inside of a hobo so at first I couldn't take it too seriously but as it progresses you can see this dark undertone beginning to form eventually leading to the Doctor realising he is not a good man but a bad dalek. I really liked this one and can't wait to see how they create the inside of a dalek. 

The Robin Hood episode was weird in the sense that I have just finished reading a book called Time Riders-The Doomsday Code which is about a group of time travelers going back in time to 1194 in Sherwood forest to find the cause of a disturbance in time which ends up being a robot and Robin Hood was there as well. The premise for this episode is so similar I wouldn't be surprised if Gattis read this series. It was enjoyable but not amazing. 

Listen was one of the scariest Who scripts I've read in a while. The time traveling was fantastic and the weight of the fragility of time really hits you in this one. I liked that they found a reason to reuse the galafray barn set from the anniversary episode. 

Episodes five's premise is brilliant and imo it was executed pretty well until the end. The ending felt very tame and less daring than the script asked for. Yes he saved an entire species from extinction but when you are robbing a bank you would hope for something more insane to match the scale the script attempts. Other than that I really enjoyed the episode and can't wait to see what's next.

The Lake district has some beautiful mountains and valleys with lakes. My favorite part is probably Derwent water. Especially in the mist with the sun breaking through. It can look like a place straight out of fantasy. Wast water is also nice as it is more remote and quiet.

Devon has a wonderful coastline for walking. High towering cliffs. caves, blue sea and waves. I once found a big chunk of silver ore on the beach. There is also moorland with some nice walks.

Cornwall has lower cliffs, but lots of hidden coves and small fishing villages and more moors.

If you want to stretch to Wales, then Snowdonia is my favorite spot with high craggy slate mountains. Pembrokeshire is a close second with some gorgeous coastal walks. The Brecon beacons are also very nice with high rounded mountains and some lovely valleys.

Then there's Scotland with more choices than you can shake a stick at. The Highlands, the west coast and the islands being favorites.

Perfect example was when I was on Bleacher Report many moons ago, a little before the team was scouting Rasmus Elm, I casually mentioned how he was having a solid season and obviously would be attracting the likes of many bigger clubs. Then when the word came that Liverpool reps went to an AZ match to scout him(despite being a match he didn't play in due to his wife having a kid), everyone instantly thought I was magically in the know and knew everything about it. I just made a well educated guess that the team would scout him.

This instantly resulted in writers for the Bleacher Report LFC page asking me if I had more info and how they'd keep shit confidential. I eventually stopped going to the site and I remember that time there were idiots making up ""Likely starting 11 for the season"" with Rasmus Elm in the mix.

As for people abusing it, or having unacceptable comments (""yer ma"" stuff, sectarianism, general rude/offensive shite etc.), those users could be reported and have their custom flair revoked, if that's possible.  I know on other subs you can message mods to have a custom flair.

So did Azplicueta but we still love him so dearly. Yet Lukaku has a bad World Cup and it completely disproves everything he's done the past two seasons? So I rightly I assumed you was judging him off that alone but you remove the World Cup and you have a proven Premier League striker who scores goals, holds up the ball brilliantly, has ridiculous pace and raw power for someone of his size and age. His technique is good, again for his size. The one thing he could work on is passing and decision making but it's not like we've had strikers with better decision making than him since Drogba.

Once I saw you had already been criticizing him prior to the World Cup and read some of the criticism you gave him, I then came to the conclusion you clearly hadn't watched him enough if that's what you came up with. Isn't a great finisher? His ability on the ball isn't all that? Then you talk about how we need someone more proficient in tight spaces, again, did you watch him? His raw power and pace more than make him proficient enough in tight spaces and again, his first touch and technique are pretty good. 

So there was no baseless, cliched retort. It genuinely seemed like I was reading an analysis of another player, maybe you've been watching the wrong Lukaku?  Are you sure he wasn't playing left back?

At the end of the day Torres has scored 20 league goals in 110 games for Chelsea and has somehow remained the starting striker for three seasons. Meanwhile Lukaku has scored 32 in 66 between West Brom and Everton, I wonder why he thinks he deserved more of a chance at Chelsea?

3.  Not really sure what is meant by that?  Sterling does an amazing job defensively when played wide, as did Coutinho.  Markovic also looks like he has a good work rate and with Henderson and Lallana pressing that seems like a great deal of defensive work from the midfielders forward.

4.  Playing something more like a 4-3-3 with just Sturridge up will improve our overall defensive posture versus 2 at the top.  We'll score a bit less perhaps, but also concede less as effectively it's sort of a 4-1-4-1 on defense with another player added to midfield to help cover in front of Gerrard.

His passing and decision making is so poor, that it renders his physical advantage redundant when it comes to holding the ball up. He doesn't nearly fall into that category, so I find it ironic you're the one suggesting I haven't watched Lukaku enough.

Lukaku isn't nearly the finisher he's made out to be. I'm not denying 32 goals in 66 games isn't a great return, but there's still a lot to be desired from him with regards to all the chances he misses (which, I'm surprised you haven't noticed seeing as you evidently watch Lukaku so much). I never said he didn't deserve a chance at Chelsea, merely that he's not entitled to be first choice with us, especially since we've signed Costa. I suppose we'll agree to disagree; I just see him as a promising striker that requires some amending to his game before he is what he thinks he is.

Edit: Also, the World Cup was another manifestation of his lack of proficiency in tight spaces. Belgium frequently dominated their group stage games, and played immediately outside the opposition's penalty area, leaving Lukaku with little space to function with in the box. And guess what? He struggled. And when did his best performance come?

true,elarq,capaldi,Capaldi,"Call me on it if I'm wrong, but judging by your comments about Supernatural, I assume you and your sister came to Doctor Who when Tennant was in the role?

Why do you think Capaldi is an awful choice? Have you seen anything else he has done? He was Caecilius in ""The Fires of Pompeii"" from series 4, John Frobisher in Torchwood Children of Earth, Malcolm Tucker in ""The Thick of It"" and ""In the Loop"", Cardinal Richelieu in ""The Musketeers (arguably the best character in that show), and has experience as a writer and director. 

A huge chunk of fans, myself included are excited not only because of his experience, but because he is an older actor, more in line with the actors who played the Doctor in Classic Who. What makes the Doctor unique as a protagonist is that for the most part the character is played by an older actor, and by extension uses his mind to solve problems.

In addition, Capaldi has been a fan of the show (very nearly) since its' inception. And that quality is wonderful to have in an actor who plays the Doctor. As seen in his interview when his casting was announced: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Zim8zL3Q5k

And in case you haven't been following the (non-spoilery) filming stuff, take a look at the way he is with fans:

Evidence of ATOS's contract ending is not evidence that people who are dying from starvation due to being unable to lift a spoon have been found fit to work.

Evidence of a blind person being found fit to work is not evidence that people who are dying from starvation due to being unable to lift a spoon have been found fit to work. Blind people can work, the fact that that one committed suicide after-the-fact, though unfortunate, changes nothing.

Evidence of a woman with a history of depression being found fit to work is not evidence that people who are dying from starvation due to being unable to lift a spoon have been found fit to work. The fact that she committed suicide after-the-fact, though unfortunate, changes nothing.

Evidence of a depressed insomniac being found fit to work is not evidence that people who are dying from starvation due to being unable to lift a spoon have been found fit to work. The fact that he committed suicide after-the-fact, though unfortunate, changes nothing.

That last link is probably the closest to backing up what you are claiming in that that woman has seriously debilitating mental and physical disabilities, however she is not dying from starvation and can certainly lift a spoon. It does however say in that article that they carried out nearly 750,000 face-to-face assessments in 2011 though. 5 ""bad"" cases in 750,000 really is not bad going.

Lille has qualified for the 3rd round of champions league qualification, with I believe a best placed playoff spot, so even if they lose they will still be in Europa league, hence the club plays twice a week almost every week and players become accustomed to playing in the domestic league on the weekend and travelling/playing in a knockout European competition on Tuesday/Wednesday or Thursday.

The gulf in managers, tactics and prestigiousness. I will admit I don't follow either leagues as much I would like, but do watch when I can as I do know a bit of French. There are many managers in the Championship who simply would not be able to make it in the Premier League, and if you look at Lille's last coach/manager he guided Roma to a formidable season this year, their current coach in Rene Girard http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard_(football)#En_tant_qu.27entra.C3.AEneur) who won the league with Montpellier for their first time in their history with Giroud as the main striker. This can be extended to their trust in youth in general, and the players who have achieved high standards in France and for other clubs, Hazard and Gervinho exploited space in and behind defences and using the false striker we saw so successful with Spain to such a degree that Hazard stayed an additional year as the team was built around him and he learned to be a false nine himself as well, but Chelsea have yet to deploy as this explicitily, I'm sure it contributed to his passing ability we see in the PL.

With European competition guaranteed, I can see Lopes developing a starting spot in the team and having a backup, playing at least once a week and often twice. The tactics and possible lack of physicality compared to the Championship is drastic imo and he could be able to develop a lot more to fit into a Pellegrini/Manchester City side than he would in most leagues, I hope more of players are loaned to French clubs in the future.",0,1404794436,null,0,false,0,circ1eo,t3_2a07s1,t1_circ1eo,t1_ciqsbxa,null,1434604458,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1

true,jjones217,num23,,"American here. I played in high school and college but had never really followed any clubs teams closely since the MLS was mostly shit and other sports had far more exposure on TV.

When I was deployed to Iraq again in 2010, our fitness center had TVs that would show nothing but football. I got into watching some Bundesliga games but I always liked going on Saturdays and Sundays when they would air live PL games. I naturally hated Arsenal, United, and Chelsea and Liverpool and would root for their opponent in every match they were featured.

After the 2010 world cup I got really invested in the game and decided that with my freshly purchased internet connection to my trailer in Basra, as well a shit ton of free time each day after 6 pm, I should start watching premier league games and choose a team.

During the playoff qualification round of the CL, i noticed spurs playing and I had seen them play before and enjoyed watching them beat Arsenal back in April. Plus they were only English team that wasn't one of the big four. That plus their annual underdog status, which I found via research, made me decide to follow every game that year.

And damn was it a good year. From Bale's breakout into the Champions League and hitting the quarterfinals. Plus the fight to the last month or so with Arsenal for 4th - it was exciting.

I'll never go back. Spurs for life and, crazy as it is to say for an American - I much prefer the PL season now to the NFL simply for it's depth.

Don't get me wrong. NFL gets me more excited at the time, but it lasts a mere 17 weeks and offers between 16 and 20 games, whereas spurs give me 38 games plus FA Cup, League Cup, and Europa leauge.

If we'd just cut out 50% of the individual mistakes we made last season, we'd have won the league handily.

Not having Kolo Toure playing will also help, I think.

Similar, if not the same, situation is happening with Lovren. Whatever be the situation, he's a Southampton player first and you don't go about bitching to the press about it. 

But you know what mate, if he's successful in forcing a move to Liverpool, nobody would mind. Because people remember you for the performances. That being said, he can do this to Liverpool too if Barcelona comes calling sometime in the future. 
I might not like him as a person and his bitching, but i do like him as a player. I don't support his antics per se and i sympathize with Southampton and their supporters. I mean, they are in their rights to get good deals out of an important player. 
But they have not been playing right, have they ? Not telling him about offers is not done. Ignoring his phone calls is infuriating if they consider him an important player. 
They can reject the offer but they must tell him/must take his calls.

true,AStandardAmerican,flair3,,"I grew up not liking soccer in the midwestern USA (surprise).  After years of brushing soccer aside I became interested in FIFA and soccer. Constant exposure from two or three of my friends subdued me. They had had favorite teams they had followed all of their lives. I wanted one too because I liked the sport but wasn't emotionally invested. Yet the emotion of soccer seemed so gripping and passionate!... I had to try it. 

So, years ago, I'm looking through the clubs on the FIFA kick-off menu's PL list. I wanted the PL because I knew I could watch it, it was in English, it was competitive, and seemed the best. And I knew I didn't want a sell out like United, Arsenal, Chelsea or Liverpool. I wanted a club I could call my own.  I had never heard of Tottenham, they looked cool, they weren't a juggernaut by any means, and no one I knew liked them. So I figured, why not? So there, right then and there, I selected ""Spurs"" as my FIFA team of choice. I began to follow them and here I am today, a die-hard fan interested in this sport and this club more than anything else. 

You could call it cliche, but what other choice did I have? Even a soccer naive fan like myself knew the MLS was shit. I wanted the real thing. And I'm so lucky I chose the beautiful roller coaster that is Tottenham Hotspur. 

Now they're my main sporting interest. It's unreal how much it's changed for me. This is what I read up on, this is what I watch, it's become my love and my passion. I've gone from some stupid American distant fan to a fucking Spur and can't wait to see them this summer.

Go further away to the East and you have Northumberland and Lincolnshire, two very under-rated counties for their rural charm. Those of us who know how pretty they are don't tend to tell too many others because we don't want them to turn into the Lake District in the Summer.

In the South, almost everything South of Birmingham and West of London is near somewhere pretty. It's amazing how few people neglect the West Country around Gloucester and instead head straight down to Devon and Cornwall (which are also gorgeous).

Obviously most of Scotland is very pretty if you avoid the bits everybody knows are a bit grim: that's just a few bits of the cities. The rest of it is lovely. I personally love taking the train up to Edinburgh and staring out of the window.

true,ppphhh,null,null,"I finished uni a few weeks ago. This last year I've been living alone, in my second year I lived in a shared house with some guys, and I was in halls for the first year.

I would highly recommend going into halls for your first year and seeing how you get on. I was extremely apprehensive, I'm a bit of an introvert and not a big drinker so I was worried about being kept up at night and having to deal with everyone else's shit just like you are. I won't lie, there was a fair bit of that, but it was worth it. If I hadn't lived with those people I'd have never made any friends at all. Plus, there are no neighbours worse than students, it will toughen you up for drama later on in life. Sharing a bathroom wasn't as bad as I thought, people's first lectures weren't always at the same time so there was never a huge wait in the mornings. It got cleaned professionally every two weeks, as did the kitchen, I don't know how standard that is. I did have to deal with mess in the kitchen quite a lot but I just moved people's shit and cooked round it.

My second year was basically the same, minus the regular cleaning, and plus bills. We did have some issues with one of the guys not paying rent and not having bill money on time, but it never got out of hand. In your first year be sure to pick your housemates wisely, I moved in with a guy I knew was flaky and he was the one who gave us trouble. Get to know everyone you plan on moving in with. The reason I went on my own in the end was due to that, noise, and honestly just wanting to try it.

Living alone *is* better in that there's less noise and more privacy, but you can still have noisy neighbours. Living solo in a house next to students isn't going to be an improvement. I'm in charge of the bills and rent, which is nicer, but of course they're way more expensive. The main downside though, is loneliness. I'm a pretty introverted guy, but I now live an hour's walk from all the people I used to hang out with. I've only seen them a few times this year, because I either have to walk an hour each way, or not have anything to drink so I can drive to see them.  If you lived alone from the start you'd better be very good at befriending people on your course, and willing to put the effort in to maintain your social life.

Ilori has potential, Wisdom will need to kick on this season, Coates needs to be sold and poor Martin Kelly's time with the club may well be running out.

I firmly believe that if we had Vincent Kompany last season we would have been league champions and not Man City.

For every argument that this subreddit shouldn't have editorialised titles because this or that place doesn't allow them, there's an equally valid argument that they should remain allowed because they are allowed on other subreddits. So citing other examples in itself doesn't actually legitimise the argument for a ban at all. 

I don't know, ultimately I think it's a non issue and haven't been persuaded by your argument. Which is fine, we don't all always have to agree. I don't think there's a very strong argument for banning editoralised titles - people should be allowed to write what they like and if other people don't agree with it, they can either ignore it or provide a counter argument. I think the notion that banning editorialised titles is done to help those who create editoralised titles isn't worth taking seriously, to be honest. 

&gt; Not when it's relating to news. In fact, the big news subreddits strictly prohibit it. 

We aren't a big news subreddit, and frankly, those places are shitholes anyway. We shouldn't aim to emulate them.

Look, I agree that downvoting is a little out of control on this subreddit, but that's a completely separate issue from editoralising titles. I think trying to slap a ban on that kind of thing is like putting a sticking plaster over your eyes because you've cut your knee.",0,1404804444,null,0,false,0,cirf2vp,t3_2a32q1,t1_cirf2vp,t1_cirewj5,null,1434606130,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2

Move to Dubai, United Arab Emirates and set yourself up as a one man LLC corporation in a Free Zone. (total cost ~$10k.)

This will allow you to grant yourself a long term residence visa, and makes [you liable for 0% Capital Gains Tax and 0% Income tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_Arab_Emirates).

Then, you stick the remaining $700k into a broad portfolio of index funds and bonds.

As per the [trinity study](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study), you can afford to pay yourself 4% of the portfolio a year and never run out of money (in theory)

You pay yourself $28k a year from the portfolio at 0% income tax and CGT.

[UAE residency visa allows you to remain out of the country for up to 6 months](http://www.visaprocess.ae/details.php?page=out_of_country).

Spend 6 months a year living in Thailand, 6 months a year in Dubai (retain residency visa an 0% tax rate).

Find a hobby you enjoy and pick it up as a side job, (maybe blogging or starting a small business) to supplement your $30k a year tax free passive income.

Enjoy your new life, work out what you want to do with your life and follow your dreams with a solid financial standing to start from.

Living with strangers is a massive gamble. It *can* go well but you just don't know. It didn't go well for me at all; I had a horrible time.

Having said that, you should live yohr first year in halls just for the sake of meeting people and getting into university life. You'll have your own room and will probably make more and better friends from halls than at your course. I made my two best friends in halls.

Live by yourself afterwards though. It's amazing. I would never go back to living with other people if I can help it. But I also wouldn't change the year I had in halls.

He's a complete striker, yeah he's still got a lot to learn but he's only recently turned 21. Lukaku is a great finisher and that's proven, a lot of the chances he misses aren't down to his finishing either and more to do with his decision making, which we've already established needs a lot of work but this often improves with age. 

He isn't entitled to be first choice, but that's this season and he hasn't even moaned about it this season and I'm sure he'll be happy fighting Costa for the striker position. It's last season when he complained and when he should have been the first name on the sheet. Imagine being Chelsea's youngest, most prolific striker and having the biggest flop in Premier League history, Demba Ba and a winger start the opening three games of the season ahead of you... 

Again you go back to the World Cup to back up your points like I care. He had a bad World Cup get over it. So did Hazard, Shurrle has had a good one so far but no fans are calling for Shurrle to replace Hazard are they? They hardly dominated their group games either, did they? They won all three by one goal. They made a two goal comeback in the last 20 minutes against Algeria, scored the only goal of the game in the last few minutes against Russia and scored the only goal against South Korea in the last 15 minutes. If anything, both Russia and South Korea played better than Belgium. Belgium as a whole wasn't very impressive and had they actually had a tough group they probably wouldn't have progressed.

Guess who else had a terrible World Cup and struggled in tight spaces? Costa, the guy you so seemingly so fit to be our starting striker. Don't get me wrong, I think Costa is a wonderful player and should be our starter, I'm just using him as an example to point out why you're being completely unfair to Lukaku because if it was down to World Cup performance's despite how bad Lukaku was, he'd still get the nod ahead of Costa.",0,1404809311,null,0,false,0,cirg2d8,t3_2a17o1,t1_cirg2d8,t1_cir83fy,null,1434606447,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0

I went recently for an issue that's taken me years to get diagnosed (it was only because I broke down crying in a Locums office that I got sent for scans) and even now I don't really understand the condition or what I can do to help myself other than ""lose weight"" (which is difficult when the condition directly affects the ability to lose weight). 

As far as I'm aware my diet is probably not the best, but it's not quite fizzy drinks and pizza. I've asked for help losing weight (being sent to a Nutritionist etc.) and was told that Slimming World does a course every Tuesday (I'd rather change my diet than start a faddy one) and that I can join up but wont get any help with that kind of thing from them.

I was also mis-diagnosed with Septic Tonsillitis with Glandular Fever. It was only because my mum came in from work one day and could smell how bad my throat was (rotting away) while I was crashed on the sofa that she rushed me to the Walk-in-Centre, who then told me to get myself to hospital ASAP. The day before my doctor had taken a look at me and given me some antibiotics to use for a week. I was in hospital on intravenous everything for at least a week.

IMO, he used the diamond to better fit Studge and Suarez in their favoured positions.  When one wasn't fit, he played that 4-2-3-1.  Without Suarez, he can play Studge up front by himself and have any of  Sterling/Coutinho/Llana/Markovic/Can/Henderson behind (beginning of the season, before Lucas' injury, Henderson was playing wide right in that system... he moved into the center when Lucas got injured).

Fairly large.

Yes.

Try Java in London. You could probably get double £ what you get in Cambridge. PM me! I have a contact with IBM and I could pass your CV on.

example: http://www.technojobs.co.uk/search.phtml/java/searchfield/locationlondon/radius/salary

General engineering salaries peak at around £50K, and it's a hard barrier to break through unless you move in to management. If you're after a good engineering salary, don't go to the UK. Salaries have stagnated here for the last 15 years. Try Australia!  You can generally start on 6 figures if you know your stuff.

Benefits are pretty good. I get 25 days holiday, possibly more, can't remember. Free lunches, health insurance, extra pension, salary sacrifice, share options, annual bonus, etc. It's no Google or Apple but it's pretty good.

Cost of housing in Cambridge is stupidly high though, and the quality of houses is generally fairly low. 

There are loads of foreigners where I work, so working visas must be fairly easy to obtain.

PM me if you want me to put your CV forward where I work.

EDIT: I contacted my friend (senior consultant) at IBM. He's not currently hiring for his project, but you can check the IBM website for current vacancies and he can review your CV and recommend you.

I remember hating London. Just utterly despising it from afar. I realised all I really knew of it though was Euston, Old Street, bit of TCR. That isn't London, I know that now. But back then, I thought all of it was like that.

One year I decided I needed to get used to it - clients down here, I'd be travelling down regularly, I needed to come to peace with being here etc. - I just needed to get over my ""phobia"". I booked a hotel for a few days up near Bayswater/Queensway. About 10 minutes from Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens. No business trips, just ""enjoy"" London. I didn't think it would work.

I remember one Summer evening that week walking through long grass in Kensington Gardens after a long walk up from The Serpentine in Hyde Park towards the Round Pond. The sun was dipping, and all you could hear was a few birds and the wind in the trees. I remember thinking to myself I was completely and totally relaxed. More so than I had been in years. Then it hit me: I was still in London. The hatred went.

That was about 8 years ago. I've lived here for 2 years now. Sometimes I need to head to the parks, sometimes I zoom out to Greenwich (the boat is fun) and get some air, sometimes I need to get further away and have some peace, but it's much easier to do that than I found it when I lived in the centre of Manchester for about 10 years.

No, it isnt because of sexual orientation.

But they arent doing that, they're asking this firm to specifically go against their beliefs in producing material which is against their beliefs. Fundamentally this is no different to going to a Halal butcher and demanding pork. 

And lets be real here, do we think its any accident that of all the bakers that these 2 boys could have chosen, they chose the deeply christian one?

There's plenty of time be sensible in your own house after you graduate. Use your house to fund a student lifestyle for a few years!",0,1404812561,null,0,false,0,cirgmny,t3_2a4p6b,t1_cirgmny,t3_2a4p6b,null,1434606712,7,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,7

true,andthisiswhathe,null,null,"By ""different"", OP, did you mean ""the same old shit we've been reading for three years""?

&gt;Romelu Lukaku was a Chelsea fan. He dreamed of playing for Chelsea. We purchased him when he was barely 18 and he was thrilled, he said something along the lines of the only time he would cry is when he would play at the bridge. He was rather expensive given his age but this is a player that just led his native Belgium league in scoring at the age of 17, an immensely gifted player.

Something we already know.

&gt;After his great season in Belgium he came to Chelsea where the club kept him out of the team almost the entire season. The club didn't loan him out and we didn't play him ourselves. He was an 18 year kid and he seemed to be crushed. He even said he didn't feel like he contributed to the champions league win, which to be fair he didn't.

Because Drogba was better than him. Again, we already know this.

&gt;The next season Romelu is now 19 and after his wasted year he get's to go on loan. He goes to West Brom and has a fantastic season. There was optimism among fans about the loan but nobody expected him to play as well as he did. He showed that Chelsea had made a wise decision to purchase him for a big sum the year before. At the same time as Lukaku's terrific season Chelsea's strikers were floundering. Drogba was gone, his prior season far from prolific, and Torres and Sturridge remained. By January a frustrated Sturridge was sold and Demba Ba was purchased. Demba Ba and Torres failed to impress at chelsea but Ba was great at newcastle before arriving and sturridge was great for liverpool at the end of the season. It can easily be argued that Lukaku outperformed any striker in a Chelsea shirt that season and this at the age of 19.

Again, same old shit. I'm yet to hear anything different.

&gt;After his great season Lukaku returned to Chelsea for preseason where he was our best striker. The season started and Lukaku barely got a look in. Torres Ba and even Schurrle got starts ahead of him at striker. Likely fearing a repeat of his first season at the club Lukaku, now 20, opted to go out on loan after chelsea bought at 4th striker (Chelsea play 1 striker at time) in Eto'o. A lot of you consider Lukaku doing this a failure to fight for his place. Lukaku was just making the decision that was right for him. There was no indication he would get a chance, and it wouldn't have been the first time. With the world cup approaching he couldn't take the chance and I wouldn't blame him if he saw the purchase of eto'o as a sign the club didn't trust him.

Again, we've heard this before. 

&gt;Lukaku went on to play very well for Everton and helped them to 5th in the league, two spots behind Chelsea. Again he easily outperformed our strikers

I'm not sure about that. 33 year old Eto'o scored some pretty important goals for us.

&gt;and he established himself as clearly the best young striker in the world.

LOL.

&gt;The World cup comes and Lukaku, now 21, is the starting striker for Belgium. Chelsea sign Diego Costa, the 3rd striker signing since half way through lukaku's great season at West Brom. While Lukaku showed flashes of brilliance he ultimately had a disappointing world cup, as did a lot of Belgium's young players including our own Eden Hazard. While he gets bashed a lot for his poor world cup here he was certainly better than 25 year old Diego Costa.

Again, we've heard this all before.

&gt;If you look at Lukaku in perspective you realize he is a special player. The best young striker in the world by far

No.

&gt;I am so sure that if he played for a smaller club we'd all want the club to sign him. There would be links in the papers linking him to all the big clubs, but mostly Chelsea even if there were no tangible links or sources similar to our link to Paul Pogba.

I wouldn't want to sign a player who is yet to show me that he can play effectively with his back to goal, can control a football with ease and generally doesn't just look like a bodybuilder who can play football a bit.

&gt;Romelu lukaku is currently one of four first team strikers (Again chelsea play one up top unlike say Man City who play two at a time) at the club. He is going into his fourth season at the club and he has never been given a chance despite being our best striker the last two years. He doesn't want to go on loan again and he might even want to leave and at this point can we really blame him?

Then he should fucking fight for it, the cunt. All we hear from him is moan, moan, moan. Chelsea haven't given me a chance. Blah blah blah. If he's so confident in his ability (as he's always keen to remind people) then why isn't he up for the challenge? Look at Azpilicueta - he wasn't in the team at the start of the season and what did he do? Sulk and demand to go out on loan, or work his nuts off, seize his chance when it came and end up displacing the greatest left back the Premier League has ever seen as number one choice?

Lukaku is an entitled bellend and nothing you've said is different or offers anything new.

&gt;We support the club and most of us support Mourinho. He is a Chelsea legend but he isn't perfect. If Lukaku is sold and he goes on to become a top striker elsewhere that would be a huge mistake by the club's management, Mourinho included. It would certainly be worse than Pogba and united, especially if Diego Costa doesn't impress and we're in the market for a top striker again in a couple seasons.

If if if. Paul Pogba is currently a lynchpin in one of the strongest teams in the world. Lukaku has scored lots of goals for Everton and West Brom. Completely incomparable.

The problem with Lukaku is thus: he is nowhere near as good as he thinks he is. The one time he's come up against a load of teams who play like opposition do against Chelsea - this World Cup with lots of teams sitting very deep against Belgium - surprise, surprise, he's been useless.

Nothing of what you say is different - it's the same old emotional shit repackaged in slightly different wording, albeit with the somewhat hilarious notion that Lukaku is ""clearly"" the best young striker in the world.",0,1404813645,null,0,false,0,cirgtao,t3_2a4gn4,t1_cirgtao,t3_2a4gn4,null,1434606799,28,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,28

true,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,"This is a tricky point to adopt. Homosexual marriage is only a political issue for as long as it takes for politicians to stop talking about it. After that it just becomes a personal issue. You can't force someone to adopt a political stance, admittedly, but how much of a political stance are you taking by baking one cake for a private customer? How many people are going to see it and be against it? Chances are that cake was meant for people who were for homosexual marriage and equal rights for same-sex couples (something that still doesn't exist, by the way, in terms of health insurance, some pension plans, shared bank accounts with specific banks and family employee benefits for certain companies) and not by those that continually lobby for the opposite. 

The fact that they're Christian is a prickly issue. Not all Christians believe that gay marriage is sinful or if they do then they do it extremely passively. This is something more active. 

Hell, the bakers themselves could have just said ""we'll bake your cake, but we'd appreciate it if you didn't tell people where we got it because we want to remain as neutral as possible on the issue"" bam. Business concluded, no hurt feelings, no boycott, no BBC article.

If they're willing to take a political stance against gay marriage, I would argue, then they were likely prepared for the backlash anyway. They had other options, they elected this one.

I'm actually somewhat with them on this one. If a BNP member wandered in and wanted a BNP cake, they would probably think twice and possibly refuse in case people felt taking that business construed them supporting those ideals. 

Same with this. They don't support gay marriage, and think that making that cake might be seen as supporting it. It's fair enough if they didn't turn away the people based on their being gay, they turned it down based on the political message. If they don't want the business, fine. 

On the other hand, being pro-equality I'm just as free to refuse to buy from them in the future now that I know what their position is. Pity, they aren't half bad.

true,AboveAllBeKind,null,null,"I do respect the alternative view on editorialised titles, but I agree they should be allowed rather than censored. Sometimes (often?) the original titles themselves are misleading, confusing or biased. Editors/sub-editors often change the original title submitted by the journalist, and it's not always an improvement - I'd a column with an NI paper for a while and some headlines sub-editors slapped on my piece were cringeworthy - when I scanned and uploaded to my website, I lopped the headlines off 'cos they looked so amateur, or changed the angle of the piece.

When you share news articles to other social media sites, you're free to post with your own title, showing what you think the important angle is (why you're sharing it) - and yes, you can do that in a comment here, but as the OP you should be able to share your thoughts as you post, not in a separate comment that could itself get buried in the noise. (I wish Reddit would just add a 'comment' field when you make a link submission anyway, and maybe auto-generate the original title as it does on FB, for example. Then you could add your thoughts and leave the original title all in the post itself. There is of course the option to post a link as a text submission instead of link submission, and add your thoughts, but that's a clumsier option.)

Plus, sometimes the point of posting a news link is to comment on the ignorance/bias/ridiculousness of the news article/headline itself, so editorialising the title is entirely appropriate and entertaining.

TL;DR Don't over-censor; sometimes the original title of a news story is sketchy and could be improved; if someone posts a news link giving it a very misleading/biased/inflammatory title, call them out on it (or ignore) and move on.

true,thespeedoghost,lfc68,,"That's a pretty good article. I don't really think anyone expected Suarez to stay if there was a chance Real or Barca came in for them. they're a huge draw for any player, especially South American or Spanish.

Same goes for Torres. He left for the wrong club, maybe, but for all the right reasons. Now, we're in much finer fettle than the dark days of Hodgson, and it's a shame to see Suarez leave, but again, he couldn't turn down Barca.

All that said he did try very hard to leave last summer too, in search of European football with Arsenal, so it makes this move even less surprising.

But I am pretty sure the club and player - new fancy contract notwithstanding - were thinking that a move to La Liga this summer was always on the cards, bite or no bite. Hence the clause.

So I'm very disappointed. Just as I was when Torres left, and Owen, and Xabi and McManaman. And it's very possible that Suarez is better than all of the above, and more valuable to the team.

But family? Nah. Not Luis.

But it does exist, in rare cases. In players like Aldo, Rush, God, Gerrard, Kenny, Cally, Jocky, Sami, Digger and Carra. The ones who truly do feel like they are part of the club's DNA.

Perhaps it's just because they spent most or all of their playing careers at Anfield. Or served the club in other capacities. Or stayed loyal for longer. Or were Scouse - or adopted as such.

&gt;""If you are a company that is trading out there in the market place and someone comes to you, you can't pick and choose whether or not to fulfil that order based on their sexual orientation""

Which is clearly untrue. This could have been a straight person ordering this cake for a function or for something else. The sexual orientation of the customer doesn't come into it, it's a political/religious stance that they don't agree with and I'm sure they've served plenty of gay people before. Try to get a cake made that says ""Jesus smoked the ganja"" and see if they make it.

The B&amp;B one is a bit more complicated. They weren't refusing to let gay people stay but they *were* essentially placing restrictions on what they were allowed to do by not giving them a double bed. The sexuality of the customers *did* matter (if they said they were brothers there may not have been any issue which is a problem).

However, it is still their own home probably and something they don't feel comfortable with. At the end of the day if you open a B&amp;B you expect to be able to turn away clients, you're clearly not forced to let anyone in if you don't want them, but obviously to discriminate isn't ideal. However, there are places for straight people, gay people, men, and women, often where exclusion based on gender/sexuality is applied with no penalty of the law.

&gt; 
&gt; I'd like an answer to this specific question. You say scientists have an agenda, astronomers are scientists. What is the agenda of someone studying supernovae in distant galaxies?

My suggestion is not that astronomers have a specific agenda as a group, any more than I would suggest historians or social scientists have an agenda as a specific group. My point is that the institutions that conduct academic research are not neutral in how they incentivise the work.

Universities are not purist knowledge pursuing machines, and indeed could not be because there is far more potential knowledge out there than we could ever collect. Academics will pursue given studies and even modes of thought (more common in arts degrees) on the basis of where grants/tenures are awarded, which ideas attract more interest or prestige, and on the basis of peer pressure. 

This is not to suggest there aren't many good scientists and much good science done, merely that to claim the scientific method sanitises the work of everyone who claims to operate under it is crap.

true,Shicchan,lfc99,,"1. I think the favoured option will be Skrtel and Sakho, but we will see a lot of Lovren. FA Cup I think could include any of the 3 with say Ilori or Toure. 

2. It'll definitely have a really big impact on the team, but Brendan obviously does not see Agger as good enough. Selling our vice-captain, a true Red (YNWA on the knuckles!) would sadden me but our alternative is to sell Skrtel, who Rodgers has favoured as first choice, in order to fit Lovren into the side. 

3. Hopefully we can sign Alberto Moreno. Kelly's time at the club sadly seems to be running out and I think Wisdom will go on loan. A dream scenario for me would be selling Johnson to a QPR/Monaco who would be willing to pay wages for someone who's sort of past it but has a big name. I would buy Atsuto Uchida from Schalke 04, I think he's a very good attacking RB and would do a great job. Arsenal were pretty heavily rumoured with him but that seems to have cooled with them nearing Debuchy's signature. 

4. Signing Lallana and improving the defensive efforts of the first team in general I think will be markedly improved from last season's already quite stellar performance. I'm confident of Coutinho, (hopefully) Shaqiri and Markovic's defensive efforts really showing next season. 

My dream window would probably include getting Lovren, Uchida, Shaqiri, Markovic, Moreno and Julian Draxler (improbable but I'd say more likely than Marco Reus, and someone who would really do wonders at around 38m). Selling Suarez, Agger, Johnson, Assaidi, Reina and Aspas as well. ",0,1404817493,null,0,false,0,cirhh1v,t3_2a3ehh,t1_cirhh1v,t3_2a3ehh,null,1434607110,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,retroshark,cnty-england,England,"i think ist pretty obvious at this point with PM's being named as well as real celebrity convictions, that the scale of this may reach through all areas of government, big and small. what keeps unrully politicians in check? blackmail material. 

its not uncommon for a candidate for major seats of power, i would imagine, to be first looked into as to what blackmail material already exists and can be used to leverage votes.

what i feel is being overly looked past is the fact that this may be more than just some twisted sex crazed peadofiles. it may in fact be quite the common thing in parliament or government wide. i would not be shocked to hear in the coming years that nearly all MP's are implicated, as it takes a very certain type of person to run, win and sit in those seats, often times with a massive overlap into the realms of highly abnormal psychology, such as peadophillia. to me it is obvious that this is not to do with the children, not jimmy saville, but rather a systematic means for blackmailing and entrapment for politicians who need to be kept under control. 

how many times has there been major scandal involving these outrageous claims of satanic cults, child sex rings and other dodgy dealings within the government or high societal elites? there is a reason why these same type and magnitude of claims are made over and over against the same types of people in the same positions of power. Special branch have been recorded on record to have intimidated witnesses, child protection officers and social workers, especially regarding the Elm Guest House affair in the 80's. I highly suggest reading some of the following pages and articles.

(i) The US may be one country but in its behaviour its more like 50 little countries that never acts uniformly.
(ii) When picking a team of a secondary sport in your home country  unusual rules apply (I initially picked Real Madrid in Spain because their kit looked like a Spurs kit)
(iii) In my experience in the US, NYC was Arsenal country, Boston was Celtic/Liverpool Country, DC was Liverpool country, New England was Spurs Country and Man Utd was liberally splashed around everywhere. Rather strangely, of late my relatives that live there speak of the huge influx of Chelsea and Man City fans - but many of them are *new* football supporters.
(iv) These allegiances aren't only formed on state lines but break across nationality lines as well. So, often you find the ""Park"" effect driving Korean interest in Man Utd, Tevez drove a lot of the latino crowd towards Utd as well. But as rightly pointed out, you'd find a poor Fulham fan who was simply following Dempsey. Or a Friedel fan, that has a number of different jerseys. A Brazilian friend of mine would comment about how Spurs games were featured on local TV this year because both Paulinho and Sandro played here. I expect the same to happen in Argentina this year with Poch, Lamela, etc (although we've had long links with Argentina.) This drives awareness and association.
(v) Lastly, from me its Bill Nich. Basically men (mostly) of a certain age associated with either Busby, Shankly or Nicholson and passed it on. Arsenal didn't get a look in back then as they were in the dark age of Crayston, Swindon and Wright, Chelsea were a nothing club and Man City apart from the magical 67/68 season didn't have a football brand they could export.

I was pretty down about moving away from my buddies at school and was channel surfing in my parents house when I caught the pre match handshakes between Spurs and Chelsea. At the time I'd never watched a full soccer match. Ever. I remember the camera panning around WHL and seeing ""The Game is About Glory"" and ""To Dare is to Do"" written on the balconies. I was intrigued. I'd also heard of Chelsea from a friend and knew their recent Big-Russian-Oil-Money success. Being a Kansas City sports fan, I had no business casually supporting a financial bully like Chelsea. The game ended in a draw, but not before a brilliant Bale cross to Ade and a sloppy equalizer from Daniel Sturridge. I had no tactical knowledge of the game, but I knew that what I was seeing from Spurs was beautiful. The rest of that season was blissful. Waking up at the break of dawn to catch Spurs v Norwich (and Bale's brace) solidified my football affection. After that I read every book, visited every website, and watched every video I could find. That Summer I drove 18 hours solo to catch Spurs v Liverpool in Baltimore. This team has brought me as much frustration as adoration, but I've learned that Spurs fans couldn't have it any other way.

I am antiauthoritarian by nature, and any time I see rules or I'm bossed about I tend to think ""you'd better have a good reason for that"". I tend to believe that mods should have a duty to the community they serve.

However, I've come to realise that it's inherent to the internet that moderators have to make judgement calls and act on their own initiative. It's inevitable that they're unfair sometimes, and there's no point in arguing about it.

You can't have trial by jury in internet forums like this, and whatever mods say or do [there will always be someone accusing them of being wrong.](http://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/2a164q/meta_commercial_interests/ciqlsj9) Mods can be completely fair and transparent and, with thousands of subscribers, there will always be someone who feels persecuted and will twist their actions.

Mods are volunteers with limited time, and frankly it's unfair to expect them to spend hours (I know that this isn't what you're asking) on discussion ""proving"" their openness and transparency. A good mod apologises when they're shown to be wrong, and is reasonably fair - IMO that's the best we should hope for.

Well, I live in Glasgow and we have a huge number of Muslims here and I can't remember ever hearing such sentiment. But that may be because we have our own inter-Christian discrimination thing going on, the minorities are being discriminated against by not even registering on our discriminationometer!

&gt;  bring me 3 where an Islamic business has been punished by the Equality commission. 

No, the onus is entirely on you. I'm not even convinced that the original problem exists, so how can I prove that it is being addressed by the government? You might as well ask ""bring me 3 examples where the government properly dealt with invaders from Mars"". :-)

Where are the actual original cases of discrimination? I buy beef from Hindus and pork from Muslims via a variety of fast food outlets. The ""worst"" complaint I've heard was the recent decision from Subway to allow certain franchises deviate from their regular set menu. Any business setting up in this country knows that it has to deal with the demands of their customer, lest they go bust quick style. In Subway's case they were responding the fact that pork products weren't selling in certain areas which was losing them potential income. That's business. 

It's the more established folks like the Christians who feel entitled to discrimination. This isn't a uniquely Christian failing, it's purely because it's ""their country"" and they are in the majority which makes them think their attitudes are palatable. That's perhaps why you might perceive an imbalance in the ""punishment"" of such acts as there are far more Christians in the news regarding it e.g. the B&amp;B case from a couple of years ago. How many Muslim-owned B&amp;Bs are there in the UK? 

&gt;  i have a problem with the ""Liberal elite"", the Islington dinner party champagne socialists. The people who have turned this country into a shitstorm of leftist rhetoric and social engineering. 

I like how you use ""champagne socialists"" as a slur, that always amuses me. The criticism there essentially is ""ha ha, you aren't full blown communists"", as if wanting a slightly fairer society without going full-Stalin is a bad thing. OK then...

I think you have a very warped view of who runs this country and their motives. The UK civil service are not ""champagne socialists"", they are old-guard Etonians. Everything they do that you consider ""leftist"" has been about profitability. We fund higher education because it's needed in order to compete globally. We fund a national health service because it's cheaper overall. We fund social housing because it's cheaper than the alternatives of homelessness, disease &amp; crime. We fund the unemployed because it's better than getting mugged in our cities. Pure ""leftist"" programs which don't improve our bottom line don't go through.

A vulnerable couple in need of support. You can't take away their right to a family life but they could have been supported. Unfortunatly, the money for that kind of care and support just isn't available.

It'd be an ethical and moral minefield to sterilise them, and so they have children that are taken away from them after birth because they cannot cope.

&gt;After previous pregnancies, DD had suffered seizures, haemorrhaging - and even a stroke - whilst giving birth.

&gt;All five children had been taken into care and four of them had been adopted.

&gt;After hearing that she is pregnant yet again, Mr Justice Cobb opened the way for the intervention by medics and police.

&gt;The judge authorised ‘forced entry’ into DD’s home and restraint and sedation if necessary to keep her in hospital for the birth.

&gt;The senior family judge said DD’s ‘undoubtedly unwise’ past behaviour revealed she was unable to make rational decisions for herself.

&gt;He ruled that her ‘best interests’ - and those of her unborn child - lay in her undergoing a hospital caesarean whether she liked it or not.
Recognising that his order impacted on DD’s “most precious and valued human rights” - including her right to liberty - the judge ordered that all reasonable steps be taken to minimise her distress and “maintain her dignity”

I aced the theory test, no problems whatsoever, in fact twice as I had to redo it when I gave up with trying to pass for a while.

My first test I went in confident and I did extremely well and had no minors.  Unfortunately on the way back to the test centre I had a major relating to a red light on a roundabout fitted with multiple lights that got me confused.

After that, my confidence was shattered.  I got back on the horse though, booked my test again but everytime I got back in that car for the test the nerves would take over.  

I ended up changing driving instructor too and on 2nd attempt with him I passed.  He helped me control my nerves and got me through it.

Oh, just to point out, one of the failures was that I had a headlight out!  Night before test instructor called to say his car had a problem and was in garage so had option of cancelling or using my own car.  Used my own car but failed to realise headlight had blown (my own stupid fault) and sure enough one of the first tests was ""show me how you turn your headlights on"".  

I also had a suicidal elderly lady jump out on me during one test.  I braked in time but still got marked for that one as had to veer slightly!

I've now been driving 7 years, have no accidents, been a confident driver, driven multiple cars/vehicles, taken on porche training days/ice driving experiences with no problems.

All I had to do was get through that god damn test.  The positive of this struggle is that I would never want to have to retake that test again, won't catch me touching booze/phone when driving!

My sister however, passed 1st time.  Has already written off a car.

My wife, learnt for quite some time and wasn't put through for a test as she struggled with gears.  She switched to automatic and passed first time.  She still struggles with knowing how close she is to objects and I often have had to help her park the car!

Did you just want to have a general rant about public schools? Go ahead but we're so deep in this thread I don't think many people will see it.

For the record though, as is perfectly clear on the link I've posted, the bursaries are means-tested. That means the school only charges you an amount it is reasonable for you to pay based on your income all the way down to 0%.

Also from that link:

&gt;Eton's aim is that finances will not be an obstacle to any boy who is offered a scholarship.

Harrow also offers means-tested bursaries (for which you don't necessarily have to have a scholarship).

Or see this from Charterhouse, one of the other original public schools:

&gt;Charterhouse aims to provide bursaries for boys and girls who fulfil the admission requirements of the School but whose parents cannot afford the fees.  All bursaries are means-tested and are subject to funds being available.  They are reviewed each year to take account of any change in financial circumstances.  Awards may cover up to 100% of the school fees.

What might be a better bet is some form of trigger for ongoing extra training or a way to get your license reviewed (Maybe if you scrape by with a pile of minor errors), but this should apply to more drivers than just those new to it. Another thing is that regular 'real' driving and gaining experience is a bit different from tuition and learning to pass a test.",0,1404822102,null,0,false,0,cirihsf,t3_2a4u6z,t1_cirihsf,t1_cirhgvc,null,1434607759,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"I think you're not giving Arsenal anywhere near enough credit. They have a hugely talented midfield, even if those players are made mostly out of glass and bits of string, and one of the best defences in the league. They conceded 41 goals last season, but 20 of those came in just four games from playing us, Everton, Chelsea and Man City away and getting battered each time.

For the majority of the games they were good for points, and basically got let down by the fact that they didn't have anyone to reliably score goals for them and turn 0-0 and 1-1 scorelines into wins (same issue we had under Benitez when Torres was injured or misfiring). They were only 5 points behind us at the end of last season. Sanchez gives them that player who can reliably create goals, and I think he's easily worth five or six points to them given the rest of their set-up.

Maybe he's not going to single-handedly turn them into Man City, but I think Sanchez is easily good enough and fills the biggest deficit with their squad last season to make Arsenal a massive threat to us if he joins them. I don't think they'll be winning the league, but things are tight enough behind City and Chelsea that I think it's a big concern to us and our ability to guarantee top three next season if he joins them.

&gt;Thirty respondents [of 32] were the first members of their family to have adopted the full-face veil.

&gt;Most interviewees of Arab or West African descent grew up in what they considered traditional Muslim households and wearing the full-face veil was in most cases alien to
their family. One interviewee said her parents had never heard of a niqab before she started
wearing it and genuinely believed that it was a religious innovation.

&gt;Twenty mothers initially disagreed, sometimes vehemently, with their daughters’
decision to wear the full-face veil. To avoid tensions within their families many young
women started wearing the niqab/seetar secretly. Only five fathers and four mothers sup-
ported their daughters’ decisions to wear the niqab.

&gt;Many parents considered the full-face veil as an extremist, radical practice, something
unrelated to religion. In this sense, Muslim parents’ perceptions of the full-face veil seemed
not to vary much from the view promoted by the mass media. ",0,1404822687,null,0,1404823083,0,cirinjt,t3_2a4v1s,t1_cirinjt,t1_cirihan,null,1434607843,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Markovic looks like a tremendous prospect and could be an amazing buy.

Given the opportunity I would have liked Sanchez here but if he wants to go to Arsenal, fair enough. We have other options and exciting times ahead. 

Lallana, Markovic ( going by the rumours ), Sterling, Sturridge, Coutinho    are a seriously exciting attacking line-up. Who knows who else by the time the transfer window closes, it's only the start of july ffs.

It all seems to come down to bragging rights during the transfer window for some people and admittedly it is easy to get carried away. 

The only bragging rights that matter are when the games are rolling on and with the talent we have and CL football back at Anfield, it's all good.

Unless it is on a discriminatory basis. 

&gt;think about pubs refusing to serve intoxicated punters for example.

That is a health and safety issue. Pubs are obliged not to serve intoxicated customers. 

&gt;You can't refuse to serve someone because they're gay, **but that isn't what's happening here;** they're refusing to catered to a specific desire from a customer, which also includes a political dimension.  

We don't know what is happening here beyond a tabloid style article. If this counts as discrimination is for the courts to decide.

&gt;private businesses shouldn't be forced to have their names associated with political statements.

Private business should do its job and not impose bullshit on customers. People should be allowed to go through their lives as they want without facing interference and discrimination.

Leeds is really very friendly, very close to the countryside, green itself, has lots of students and a vibrant music scene.  It's also slightly stuck up in a weird way (I think Harvey Nicks did it) and quite dressy but coming from Down South I'm sure you'll be confortable with that!

Manchester is much bigger, it's sprawl goes on and on and although yeah, you can be in countryside &lt; hour by train, in Leeds to you can walk/bike to it easily.  It rains more and is a rougher, more aggressive place.  However, there is even bigger music scene, there's lots of independant stuff it's also a common stop on international tours, the art/alternative scene is much bigger too, generally there's just a lot more going on that is original and it's really vibrant.  Of course, though, that likely includes stuff you don't like and wouldn't even approve of!

People get shot weekly in Manchester (source: friend who is an A&amp;E Doctor) whereas that is not the case in Leeds.

Both cities have areas you would NOT want to live in but plenty of reasonably priced nice places too, Manchester may be a little cheaper but I don't think there's much in it.

*Personally* I would rather live in Leeds as Manchester is only a wee train ride away for gigs and stuff but then again I'm not really a city girl.  If you like the pressures of the big city then Manchester is a very non-boring one and you can have lots of fun, if you like your life quieter and less threatened then Leeds still has stuff going on but is a bit less *heavy*.

Incidentally, if you like festivals then Beatherder is very Manchester and Beacons is very Leeds and I highly recommend both!  Beatherder is technically sold out but people are selling tickets on their Facebook page.  These would be excellent introductions to The North and you'd meet lots of people from both cities!

So you now agree businesses do have rights and obligations as legal entities then?  Pubs aren't the only example.  Any private business has the right to refuse to serve someone, as long as they don't fall foul of discrimination law.

&gt;Unless it is on a discriminatory basis.

&gt;People should be allowed to go through their lives as they want without facing interference and discrimination.

You're missing the finer points of this argument quite spectacularly.  They're not refusing to serve gay customers, they're refusing to make a cake for any given customer with a political slogan on it.  Most people would agree that they're within their rights to refuse to sponsor political statements.  If a gay couple came into the shop and just asked for a cake and were turned down, that would be a different issue entirely. 

Would you be this upset if they'd refused to deliver a cake with anti-Semitic slogans on it to a group of neo-Nazis?  Would you be outraged at the bullshit they're ""imposing"" on said Nazis?  I doubt it.

&gt;Private business should do its job and not impose bullshit on customers.

They're not imposing anything on anyone.  Declining business is hardly an imposition.  It's not like they're the only cake shop in the world. 

TLDR:  They're not wrong, they're just dickheads.

Avoiding the argument completely by fudging the issue.  Nicely done.  What's your actual answer to the question though?  If you prefer a different slant, how about bakers writing pro or anti abortion slogans on cakes?  It's got fuck all to do with discrimination, and everything to do with businesses sponsoring / not sponsoring political ideas.

Your argument is predicated on this being seen as a political stance and not an expression of homosexuality and that the bakeries response was a political one, and not discriminatory against homosexuality. Many in this thread are equating homosexuality as a political opinion. This is obviously nonsense. 

What if a bakery refused to print an anti-racist message? Is this a better comparison and the anti-abortion cake? I don't know, this thread does not know the details and all those offering opinions are not lawyers.

Although if I'm honest, it's always nice.

Sure it may fall in value but who cares if you plan to live in it forever. It gives you some level of safety and something to fall back on.

You mention no girlfriend / wife and anxiety. Thats gotta be tough but the money you have is a really great thing for this kinda situation. You can afford to get professional help for the anxiety and start dealing with your issues, on the NHS you can probably get some free.  Take some of the cash and join a gym, hire a personal trainer for a couple of months and enjoy working out, it will make you feel better about yourself.

Blow some of the cash on a new wardrobe and start trying to feel good about yourself.  Check out the reddits like Fitness, Nutrition, MaleFashionAdvice and start to work on self improvement and making positive changes.

Right now you can pretty much do whatever you want with your life so what are you interested in?

You don't have to work so you can dedicate yourself to study and getting those GCSEs you need to do. With the internet and doing some college courses you could easily get those GCSEs in like 6 months to a year. Or take a full time college course. I did one that is worth 2 A levels and it got me into uni, I have like 2 pretty poor GCSEs and now im a software developer with a  BSc (hons) degree so you can turn things around. If you wanted to go to uni eventually you have the cash available to pay for your tuition right away, I'm pretty sure your parents would like you spending the cash that way.

Try taking up hobbies too and see what interests you, when you find something you really like you have the cash available to really get into it and it can be a fun way to meet people too. 

As for making the money work for you, I think you should consult a financial advisor about any of the ideas you get from reddit, go along with a list and see what they suggest. You should probably start by breaking up the cash into what you would want to keep as cash for things like education, living costs etc. and then how much would you be willing to put into low / medium / high risk investments. With the amount of cash you have available you could invest or even look at buy to let properties. 

And people mentioned renting your house out and going backpacking for a year, if that kinda thing interests you do it while you're young man, with the interest you're making on the money and the rent from your house you could backpack fairly comfortably and have a great time. 

If you want someone to talk to or chill out and play games with etc drop me a PM.

It's not an expression of homosexuality, it *is* an expression of a political stance.  No-one is arguing homosexuality is political.  Pro-gay marriage slogans are political though.  Just like pro or anti marriage slogans for straight people would be.

No that's not a good comparison.  If you want to use race it's more like a business promoting affirmative action.

I'm not sure you know which side of the discussion you're on.  I'm saying that this doesn't infringe *anyone's* rights.  You're the one arguing that it's an imposition / bullying / infringement of rights.

Read through it again. 

People were complaining that this goes against the ""rights"" of the bakery. I said that they didn't know what they were talking about, that this trope of referring to your rights was very American and that people should wait for a court judgment. 

I've also tried to point out the hypocrisy in /r/uk threads. 

1.  When it comes to ""rights"". When an ECHR stops some black kid being deported to a country which plans to torture them, these ""rights"" don't get half the love.

2. When strong, uninformed opinions formed on the basis of a daily mail eqsue article are upvoted. 

&gt;You're the one arguing that it's an imposition / bullying / infringement of rights.

I'm saying that is for the courts to decide.

You can't say that, for all you know Lukaku will never improve on his passing enough for it to be considered good. His linkup play isn't just bad, for a PL striker it's awful.
 

&gt;Welbeck is 23 turning 24 and has never played as the main striker for a long period of time

But when he has he's shone. He only got 9 goals last season but mainly played as a winger, he had half the shots Lukaku had. 


&gt;and the goal scoring ability that the others just don't

How do you figure that? Welbeck had 9 goals, Remy 14, Bony 16, Rodriguez 15.. 

It's not like Lukaku is miles ahead of them.


&gt;He mightn't have the build up play of the others 

And maybe if Everton didn't play like they do, he might be fine, but Everton cannot afford to have their striker lose the ball when the fullbacks have bombed forward.

Lukaku's pass completion is 66%

Compared to Welbeck 87%, Remy 81%, Bony 74%, Rodriguez 77%

It's not just about keeping the ball though, Lukaku is not intelligent in his passing at all, which is something Everton needs there players to be. He misses what's happening in front of him. The other players I mentioned are very intelligent passers. 

Sure Lukaku could turn into a superstar when he's 24/25.. But can Everton afford to spend £20 mil odd on a player that *might* turn into the player they need in 3 or 4 years time? 

If you already had a good striker or were going to buy one of the others I'd say it would be a great buy, but the fact is you don't have that kind of money. 

I think Welbeck/Rodriguez/Remy would all be cheaper, and Bony although more expensive is basically the striker you'd want Lukaku to turn into.

Basically, it's a matter of judgement. Some dual carriageway roads are basically motorways, others are just main roads passing through towns.

Indeed, I'm one of them. I have Bipolar disorder. I'm not quite sure why you wrote what you did, perhaps you didn't understand what I wrote, or perhaps I wrote poorly.

I didn't claim mental health issues don't affect working people, I said that to use your terminology, ""high functioning"" depressive (by the very definition) are more able to deal with the illness than a low functioning depressive, however these labels are not static.

An example would be your father while he wasn't able to work (no longer be considered ""high functioning""), being forced back into it by Atos. Clearly a situation that would put him under severe duress.

To quote my previous post, *""98% of WCA appeals taken up by its advisors on behalf of mentally-ill clients were successful.""* How many of them were of people in danger of ending their own lives isn't clear, but since it's (depression) the most common mental illness, it's fair to say a large number of them were not ""high functioning"" at the time of their assessments.

&gt;The make a proper claim backed up with (more) solid evidence.

I don't need to make a case against Atos, that's already been made by disabled rights groups and charities (you can see a trend in the quote above).

There are two issues here, a gay rights issue over gay marriage in Northern Ireland, which actually has nothing to do with the bakery, and an issue of preserving the right of those who produce goods to determine what they actually sell. It's not a refusal to serve gay people. It's a refusal to actively endorse a political opinion by producing a product tied to their brand with an explicit message on it - and that *is* voicing an opinion.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;I fully understand your argument but companies will also locate where there is talent, by bringing in talent you can also bring in industries.

To an extent yes, it very much depends on the industry. Manufacturing is utterly different to services here, since manufacturing has logistics of input and output to think about, while services don't. That said, services companies generally, ultimately, are servicing manufacturing companies, and so there's the question of whether those services companies need to be based where the manufacturing companies are, or vice versa. It's very complicated. I can think of lots of different examples instantly, as there is no immediately obvious trend.

&gt; Especially given the high amount of foreign students the UK has, why bother setting up in other nations if a large majority of their high flyers are located in the UK.

The thing is, we used to allow most foreign students who graduated here ages to look for a job (I believe it was 2 years a while ago, then it was 12 months, now it's pretty much graduate and GTFO).

Now, this seems stupid if you're trying to attract skilled labour, but then immigration has to be managed somehow and as it is we already have free access (and vice versa) to a 500 million person labour market, and a highly skilled and educated one at that, so the question is, do we really want to be taking even more people on top of that?

These are complicated questions, without easy answers. Immigration policy *should* be based upon huge quantities of data and created by people with a good understanding of economic theory and human motivation.

I don't think we can be certain they'll have the same injury problems this season. I think signing Sanchez fixes their problem of lacking a top striker - even if he is a wide forward, he scored 20 goals last season and at the very least he'll give them more potency up front than Giroud does on his own. I don't think they were so far behind us last season that they're still miles away even with Sanchez. 

He was replying to a ""anywhere but Arsenal pls"" comment, with a tone that suggested we shouldn't care if he goes to Arsenal. I totally disagree with that, because I think it's perfectly reasonable to worry about a very talented player going to a club who are rivalling our position in the league. I don't think it makes them title-winners, but I'm certainly more worried about him going to Arsenal than I would be the likes of Everton or Spurs, or a club outside the Prem.

Go to my original reply to his original comment if you want my actual opinion.

Their motivation in moving here is about seeking opportunities to move beyond the need to be dependent on welfare. 

Think of the Ugandan Asians for example, who arrived as refugees in the 1970s and set up small businesses. That's a model that many, many others want to follow. 

The UK is seen as a country where it's possible to get ahead and to make a future, even if there's surface discrimination. 

There was a BBC radio documentary recently where new immigrants to the UK were interviewed, one Somali man who'd been in Sweden for over fifteen years and who was living a comfortable middle class life in Stockholm explained his motivation to move to the UK in these terms.

He talked about how his kids were constantly being asked 'when are you going home?' despite the fact they were all born in Sweden. He talked about how people corrected him when he called himself 'Swedish' despite the fact he had Swedish citizenship. He talked about how he'd been refused business loans because the local bank argued that he could shut down the business at any time and move back to Somalia. 

It's not that his Swedish neighbours were overtly racist, but the unconscious, insidious assumptions they made meant that he never felt accepted. 

And he talked about how his relatives in the UK, despite facing some racism, felt that the UK was their home, that they could talk openly about being British and Somali, that they felt comfortable with both identities. That although many aspects of settling were challenging, they felt that hard work would be rewarded and that their futures would be better.

They have a lot of holes, and if they sign just Sanchez (and I don't think it'll be just him) they'll still have holes. As much as the Ozil signing was a clear case of buying the talent when it's there, it didn't fix their issues. Nor will Sanchez. He certainly will help with goals, you're right about that. But, unless he's played in Giroud's position, they still aren't as good as they'd need to be in the striker department in order to maintain a title challenge, in my opinion.

What they really lack, for me, is some midfield balance. They have a lot of technically gifted, attack-minded players. And Flamini. Flamini was much better last season then I'd ever have guessed, but he isn't their answer in the long term (not sure if he is even their short term answer).

I don't have stats on skilled vs. unskilled migration, but net migration to the UK tends to be somewhere in the region of 130,000 per year (accounting for migration out of the UK in that figure).

&gt; why would you move if your not going to be better off.

Buddy, take a look around the EU. The east is still recovering from communism and the south is destitute. Most of the EU population can become better off by moving to the UK. I've met poles with masters degrees working as lunch ladies in the UK because they're better off doing that. There's plenty of skills we have access to in the UK from within the EU.

We have to remember the standards in which we would also like to be judged.

I also want to make it clear that no Muslim country I've ever visited have tried this on us, nor their own residents, it is just a hypothetical example.

If a tourist chooses to wear a full veil or strips to a bikini on the beach, what's the problem?

If a British resident chooses to wear one in their own country, what's the problem?

If a recent immigrant chooses to wear one, what's the problem?

If we ban the veil, do we also ban traditional white wedding dresses? Do we ban all face coverings including masks, dust/infection masks, Guy Fawkes masks?

I was just making sure we get something if we both:

a) want to absolutely sell Suarez

b) have to do it on an installment plan.


It is not just the 4% rate though - they have to be within UEFA financial fair play (FFP) thresholds so they cannot just go to a bank and get into more debt. They had the player transfer ban (which has been suspended) for exactly FFP issues. It is the suspension of the ban that allows them to bid for Suarez. I think it is really tight for them on how much they can spend this year and somewhat odd that they are allowed to purchase on such a large scale if they are having FFP issues.

There may be some reasons why a woman may chose to wear the veil, but in the majority of cases it will be because of coercion from family, religion and the community. 

In that case the reductions in personal freedoms are small compared with the good that can result, for example greater inclusion in schools, and better integration for minority communities. 

It's the same reason we ban everyone from freely owning guns, in order to protect society from the small minority who would use them for crime. A small reduction in personal freedom in order to benefit society as a whole.

Huntelaar, as mentioned, does not just stand in front of the enemie keeper and waits for balls to shove in - actually he contributes pretty much in a pressing at S04 and while attacking he is always (!) beeing tightly guarded by at least 1-2 defenders, due to his high quality scoring ability - from pretty much anywhere in the box. He manages to cut spaces for the rest of the offense and is a permanent threat to the defense.

While I'm not the most sociable of people when I go out in public for whatever reason to my bank or doctor etc, talking face to face with the individual I'm interacting with feels like the natural way to go about things.

If I was being seen to by someone who was covering all of their face in a context where one to one interaction is required I would feel pretty uncomfortable if I did not know them. To me it just feels similar to eye contact, if you are again in a situation that requires one to one interaction then if you can't engage me while looking into my eyes it feels both rude and disrespectful.

I'm not sure what the actual situation is regarding full face coverings and public employees but I'd think if you have to interact with people face to face as part of your job then all items which cover your face should be disallowed in that context.

Because in the interest of balance it makes no sense to just talk about all of Arsenal's downsides and none of their strengths. It'd be like someone saying we'll never finish top four again next season because we have the defence of a mid-table club, ignoring the fact we have one of the best attacks in the league. Or saying we'll be nothing without Suarez's 30 goals if he leaves, ignoring that the likes of Coutinho, Sturridge, Sterling and Gerrard (now plus Lallana and Lambert) still give us plenty of firepower and attacking options up front. 

If you don't think they're going to be a threat to us, then fair enough for you to have that opinion, but I completely disagree. I don't think they'll be challenging for the title, but I don't think we will be next season either, especially if Suarez leaves. I think City (if Aguero stays fit) and Chelsea (now that they have a striker) will be way out front and we'll be scrapping for third with Arsenal, in which case it's perfectly reasonable for people on here to worry about them signing a fairly big player. Like I said originally, sure they have weaknesses but they're still a force to be reckoned with as a squad and we barely finished above them last season.

Another issue, one which merits discussion though, I think nations such as our own must seriously consider polices which lead to higher birth rates of the ethnic population to keep a even balance with immigration.

I think City basically only struggled last season because Aguero was out for ages. Maybe that'll happen again, but I don't think we can count on it and I think it'll be harder for us to match City for points compared to last season. Likewise I think Chelsea are going to be pretty hard to beat now that they have Costa, a player who can actually get them goals on a regular basis, rather than relying on their midfield to score most of them while Torres and Eto'o didn't get a great haul.

I don't think Arsenal have much of a chance of winning the league, but I think our chances aren't great if Suarez leaves either. In a couple of seasons we'll get there as key players mature and maybe we get some solid signings, I just feel that in one transfer window we're going to struggle to replace a 30 goal a season striker.

I feel our realistic target next season is just to do well in the CL and to build on where we are now and keep ourselves in the top four. Maybe I'm being overly pessimistic and we will be challenging for the title, but I think if we do with our current squad it'll be because Brendan is working miracles with our younger players, rather than because we have a squad with the same amount of quality as Chelsea or City.

Sahko and Agger both seem rather injury prone, Kolo is Kolo (is a good CB but not a week in week out player anymore) and Skrtel is good but with that many games ahead of LFC he will need rest.  Coates is way too slow for the Prem and I think he leaves this window.

llori needs to be given a chance to play ball in England.  BR needs to see him deal with the physicality and speed.  However I believe his fate live in Martin Kelly.  If Kelly impresses this preseason llori could be loaned (hopefully to an English club southhampton maybe?) but if Kelly fails to impress I could see him sold and llori given the chance.  


Joao Teixeira is almost a shoe in to be loaned out again.  Last year it was much more likely for him to play with our threadbare bench but with Sterling Coutinho Lallana (markovic?) coming in he may find himself struggling for game time.  Especially since Ibe has looked really good.

Is there some kind of directory of homophobic bakers I'm supposed to check before I order any kind of gay-themed cake?

Why is everyone in this thread so confident they know how equality law works while having so little understanding of it?  If this particular political belief you had a problem with was closely tied to one of the protected characteristics defined by equality legislation, you would be on very shaky ground.  For example if you had a ""no black supremacism"" policy but not a ""no white supremacism"" policy, I doubt whether the courts would have much sympathy with you.  In addition to that, in Northern Ireland (but not the rest of the UK), political opinions are themselves a protected characteristic.

One thing that gives me hope is that I truly think a decent amount of the goals Suarez scored would've been scored by Sturridge or another good striker in that instance, as we scored a lot of team goals. The attacking power is still there without Suarez, but I am a bit worried we may end up tying some of those matches that we so pivotally won last year.

In any case, I wanted to point out that we ought to compare ourselves to City and Chelsea, not to Arsenal. Not that Arsenal are a bad club, but we want to be winning the title and we finished closer to City and Chelsea than Arsenal, so that's who we ought to (optimistically) aim for.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"Before you lose your head, keep in mind that the writer isn't necessarily saying Sturridge is going to easily replace the ridiculously amazing production of Luis Suarez. *And* the writer also states that much of Daniel Sturridge's success is based on the creativity, movement, threat and space created by Luis Suarez.

However, could the same not be said about Luis Suarez's success? If Sturridge was not on the squad, would Suarez have the same level of success? Probably not, I'd argue.

It is growing increasingly clear that Luis Suarez won't be in a Liverpool shirt for much longer and while we all seem to talk about marquee-striker this, bona-fide-goal-scorer that... I wonder if it's really *that* bad.

Sure, sure. I'm not trying to make light of the fact that we're losing a 30+ goal scorer... but a highly disproportionate amount of goals were scored by Suarez last season and maybe the unintended silver lining in Suarez's departure is the creation of a better-balanced team with goal-scoring threats from everywhere rather than just a couple players or so.

Of course, a lot of this depends on the ability of Daniel Sturridge to shoulder the burden of being the main goal-scorer, the ability of Raheem Sterling to continue his progression, the ability of the likes of Jordan Henderson and Coutinho to score more goals, the ability of Lallana to show that he can not only thrive but succeed for a big club in the Premier League.

A lot of what ifs. But, ultimately, we shouldn't dismiss what the 24-year-old Daniel Sturridge can bring to us now and in future seasons.

Your reasons are all hollow and most of them miss the mark so completely they aren't even worth arguing with. Just because you're on a subreddit where people are frustrated with Barca in the short term you're going to get away with it, but anyone with an ounce of perspective will realize you couldn't be missing the point any further.

Their soccer is beautiful, their academy is great, their footballing philosophy builds on the best that 1970's Dutch soccer had to offer and turned it into something unique, forming the basis of the great spanish teams that we've seen over the last decade. Barcelona really and truly is something special on a level that few other teams have ever been, and I say that as a huge Liverpool fan.

I see a lot of people saying that their homosexuality was not a reason for them being turned away, however, what if a hotel owner said they would refuse two heterosexual men sharing a bed therefore it's nothing against gay people specifically?

A lot of people are using clearly offensive (not objectively so, but bordering on illegal messages) to show how you could be turned away from certain establishments, but what harm would it have done to write a simple message on a cake?

If they refused to do a wedding cake for an interacial couple would that be okay? because they disagree with the wedding, but they'd probably serve the two individuals a scone and some yum yums if they asked for it?

This is discrimination, plain and fucking simple. Had they simply said the couple were rude and as such they refused to serve them, I can't imagine anyone coming in saying they weren't within their rights. But they took a political stand and they're being rightly hauled over the coals for it.

I wouldn't have thought so, the people downvoting you and telling you you can are idiots.

Obviously, if you refuse to paint a customer because they are black, that is illegal [direct discrimination](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/13).  If you only paint, say, historical figures, so that kind of direct discrimination is not an issue, someone could still probably make a strong case that by refusing to paint black people you are putting black customers at a particular disadvantage, in which case you are engaging in illegal [indirect discrimination](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/19) unless you can demonstrate that the policy is a ""a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim"", which would probably be an impossible task.

People somehow haven't noticed the bit in the article that says that the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, whose whole purpose is to advise people about Northern Irish equality legislation, have already said they think the bakery's actions are illegal.  The courts wouldn't necessarily agree with them, but they are still more likely to be correct than random redditors.

EDIT: also, the idea that you can discriminate against whoever you like as long as you don't tell anyone you are doing it is nonsense.  To prove discrimination, you don't need evidence that someone explicitly said they were discriminating against you - various forms of indirect evidence can be used, and discrimination cases are civil cases, so you only need to show that you were most likely discriminated against, you don't need to show proof beyond reasonable doubt.",0,1404839696,null,0,1404841206,0,cirq5ag,t3_2a4o8a,t1_cirq5ag,t1_cirh91h,null,1434611356,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Sturridge is a great central striker and offers a lot to the side and I would not be surprised to see him win the Golden Boot himself next season.

As for goals, we now have 5 of the top 20 goal scorers last season in the side in Sturridge, Lambert, Gerrard, Lallana, and Sterling.
