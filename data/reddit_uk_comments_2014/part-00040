At present we've got Cissokho (27), Brad Smith (20) and Robinson (21) in the frame for the left, and while Cissokho has been decent lately a permanent deal seems somewhat unlikely. Robinson meanwhile hasn't been anywhere near our first team in the league for 2 seasons now. Suggesting that while he burst on the scene early on for us he's stagnated somewhat lately. He might do well with a few more loan spells until he is first XI ready.

I'm sort of kneeling towards Bertrand because he is 25, and could potentially bridge the gap between Robinson and Enrique. Simultaneously offering a good back-up option and giving us a chance to loan out Robinson for a whole season to give him that much needed experience.

As far as the right goes: we've got Kelly (24), Flanno (21) and Wisdom as options although Wisdom is supposed to be a CB. I'm not really sure what's up with Kelly, he has shown he can be a good option at RB although lately he's struggled for time. That said Flanno is progressing really well and has already proven himself to be a decent deputy for Glen.

We might need to get another option in for the right but imo the left should be in good stead if we get Bertrand.",0,1392013558,null,0,false,0,cfbimkc,t3_1xfcmo,t1_cfbimkc,t1_cfb22ca,null,1432331368,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,lemongrassgogulope,null,null,"I think Suso/Alberto can do enough to backup Coutinho if we play 4-2-3-1/4-3-3 where Suarez and Sturridge interchange between the wing and upfront.

I don't get why some people were puzzled about us going after Konoplanka though and saying we already have plenty of attacking options. We have 1 good natural winger in Sterling and a good player playing out of position in the wing with one of Suarez/Sturridge (obviously not in a 4-4-2). Coutinho out left is at best a 2nd option so we need a class winger.

Our central midfield is strange in that we have 4 players for 2 spots but we have missing skillsets. I don't think Allen has been particularly bad but I don't see where he fits in. Glen/Flanno/Enrique is a decent fullback combo to have so the best way to improve that would be to spend on a legitimate class LB.

So what I think is:

1st Team LW

1st Team LB

Return Borini (ST backup), Assaidi (wing backup), Suso (AMC backup, worst case RW backup like last year)

Maybe get a high energy runner at DM that doesn't expect to be a 1st teamer

Maybe sell Allen if he's too expensive but 5 CMs should be ok if we have European football",0,1392018513,null,0,false,0,cfbjz61,t3_1xggou,t1_cfbjz61,t1_cfb4l33,null,1432332005,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

As an equity loan it's interest or fee-free for 5 years, but when you want to pay off the loan, you have to pay the loan back based on the current market value of the house (for example if the house was worth 100k new, you put in a 5% deposit and borrowed 20k to give you 25% deposit, if after 5 years if it was worth 120k, the loan amount you'd pay back to the gov would be 20% of 120k; £24k)",0,1392018537,null,0,false,0,cfbjzdl,t3_1xgb1q,t1_cfbjzdl,t1_cfb3f8s,null,1432332008,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3

true,violatedchimp,null,null,"&gt;Likely more progressive and open minded than you

Progressive and open-minded are not synonymous in the least bit.  It's like saying you're more open-minded when it comes to music because you like country.  The idea is to be open to other opinions, not to declare one opinion more open-minded and then only listen to that one.  Being so proud of where you fall on the political spectrum is in most cases the antithesis to open-mindedness.

&gt;I've changed my mind on issues plenty of time, going so far as to completely change my political and belief structure over the course of my life.

You're speaking in past tense about changing your opinions, and that's the trap a lot of people fall into.  They changed their opinions early in life until the settled on an ideology.  Now that they've found one they are happy with they become intransigent while still convincing themselves that they are flexible.  I might as well say I'm in shape because I ran a marathon 10 years ago.

&gt;And so, I never said everyone who disagreed with me needed to be educated. Just that if you are disagreeing with me on certain issues I happen to care a lot about, I will be doing my best to educate you on the matter.

Please read those two sentences again.

&gt;And much like in school, there will be very little dialogue on the issue until you are educated on the basics. I have little interest in debating someone on an issue they have no business discussing. 

See, here's your problem.  You assume that we disagree because I'm ignorant.  In fact, I would assume that most disagreements you have you view as ignorance on the part of the other person.  Now, how can a mind be open to new possibilities when it views dissenting opinions as inferior?  Your mind will never be open again until you stop convincing yourself that you're done learning from others and that you have to teach them.  I'm sure you have a lot of information to offer, but simply sharing a differing opinions is not ""educating"".  

Again, this is for your own benefit, because it doesn't affect me in the least bit, but if you want to gain a broader perspective of the world, you have to stop thinking of yourself and your opinions as better than other people's.  You can have your own valid arguments, but you'll never hear another person's valid arguments if you're always talking down to them like they're a child.  And if you can't hear another person's arguments, their thoughts, their opinions, you can never grow.  And when it comes to growth by differing perspectives, dissenting arguments are probably the most valuable, because only brain-dead idiots want to hear someone agree with them all day.",0,1392018628,null,0,false,0,cfbk046,t3_1xe5my,t1_cfbk046,t1_cfbjlm1,null,1432332020,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I've watched my wage stagnate since 2000. I probably peaked early because I job-hopped a fair bit with contracting, so I was able to demand a high(ish) wage fairly early on. What I've seen in the last 15 years is my wage stay the same but the price of housing and living effectively doubled. Now it's at the point that I'm at the edge of what I can afford when renting a house. see [Housing Stress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_stress)

Discuss your wages with your fellow workers. You'd be surprised what other people earn in comparison to you. It's probably against company policy to do this, but that's what they want. Divide and conquer. 

I recently went through interviews and negotiations for a fulltime job in the UK. What interested me, and what was different to Australia, was the *lack* of salary negotiation. It was assumed that you wouldn't negotiate your salary! From what I've experienced, this is fairly common in Australia.

I know it's not the English way to discuss money but the people who employ you are business people and they discuss money all the time. If they can get you to *not* discuss money, then they will get a good deal by employing you on a lower wage and save themselves money. i.e. make more profit.

If you've just sat through hours of interviews and meetings and they want to hire you, they're going to try and hire you. Stand your ground, ask for more. Firmly and politely. Round the figure up to the nearest £10K, or argue cost of living in the local area. Don't be afraid to squeeze another 5% out of them. It's a business deal. You're selling yourself at this point, so ask for a fair price.

I think the problem with wages is that there are certain psychological limits. e.g $100,000 and £50K. Beyond which employers (and possibly employees) feel that the wage is ""too high"" or ""high enough"".

After a given amount of time and inflation, everyone will eventually be on a 6-figure wage or earning more than £50K. It's inevitable. I think what's happening is that wages are squashing up against this psychological glass ceiling.

INSERT EDIT: So even if you don't earn close to £50K, there will be several levels of people above you earning close to £50K, so your wage will be squashed downwards in a series of pay level brackets. e.g. £50K/£40K/£30K when it should be £60K/£50K/£40K to keep up with cost of living.

I think it's absolute bullshit when companies blame the economy for low wages. If your company sells to a foreign market, who continues to buy the product, then they are still earning the same money and they should be able to pay you a decent wage which meets or exceeds the cost of living increases.

'Pool never fell from power. We just haven't been the top dog for some time.

If you are referring to Liverpool's end of league dominance in comparison to United's situation right now, then perhaps the answer is loss of Manager. 

Simply put: The *retirement* of Kenny Dalglish after the unfortunate Hillsborough disaster ended our dominance. Alex Ferguson's retirement impacted United.

But be sure that Liverpool still have power, and are getting stronger. United is not dead either for the matter. Leeds United - now that's an example of falling from power.

&gt; the council tax

This is essentially the bill the local council for wherever you live sends you for the functions they perform - street cleaning, rubbish removal, road repairs, ~~junkets to barbados~~ fact finding missions to other councils to improve services, etc. A portion of youre council tax also goes towards the local police service and fire service.

&gt;what the hell a TV license is.

A TV license is a legal document permitting you to have a device capable of recieveing TV or radio signals within your home. This includes live TV/radio broadcasts on computers from the internet, but not ""catch-up"" or non-live services.

It's a holdover from the days when the BBC was the only broadcaster in the country which was nationalised and funded by the people who used it's services. 

Your average TV license costs in the region of £140/year for a colour TV. Black &amp; white licenses still exist and are cheaper, and radio-only licenses also exist and are about £50/year (see what I said about holdover ;-)?)

The money from the TV license goes to the BBC for them to make their content. As a result, the BBC show no commercial adverts on any of their services within the UK.

&gt; So the NHS will apply to me on a work visa etc?

I'm not sure it will, unfortunately. I remember reading somewhere that the NHS requires a three-year term of being resident in the country as a non-citizen before they provide free treatment.

&gt;Expensive

 Less so than roads, by quite a large amount in fact. Then you have the lower maintenance costs (did you know a bike is about 6-900x less damaging to a road than a car?)

In addition you have all the other savings - health, environmental...could go on but you get the idea..

&gt;takes up a lot of space

Well ofcourse - but so do roads and so do drivers in their single occupancy cars. One of the purposes of introducing cycle lanes is to get people out of their cars. Not just to benefit would be cyclists, but to benefit pedestrians and car users.

&gt;distances between towns and cities are much larger here than in the Netherlands?

A bit of a non issue - most (lets say 90%) cycle within the confines of towns and cities.
While it would be wonderfully to have a cycling freeway I don't think its high on anyone's priorities right now.

I would personally budget about £25 per week per person for general groceries, although as a couple this might be closer to £40/week for the pair of you.

Bear in mind that the UK might use different phone signals and frequencies from Australia, and your current phones might not be able to switch between them.

Rent in the South East is generally higher than the rest of the country, and London (inside M25) is higher than the South East.

For example, I live in Finchley, in North London. I currently pay £888/month in rent for a single bed apartment. This is about average for the area.

Around Heathrow, near Staines, this is likely to be lower than my figure, but I would expect to pay over £500-600/month in rent.

Public transport wise, it depends where you need to get to. Staines is on a railway main line from London, so you should be able to get into London if you need to, but I personally have no idea how much that will be.

With money being pumped into football and big names coming in from everywhere across the world Liverpool got left behind and things got worse. Go back 10 years to the 04/05 squad and you get a real view into how relatively poor the team was compared to the rest of the big teams around the world.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"Coutinho from deep has worked great; you can make a very valid comparison with Modric, another lightweight playmaker who initially played out wide or in a conventional #10 role, before finding his best position as a CM pulling the strings.

It's also solved the problem of our midfield sometimes being toothless; for all of Henderson's improvement, Coutinho's passing range and penetration is obviously superior, and Coutinho's improved defensive work has meant our pressing game doesn't rely on having Allen and Henderson on the field together.

&gt; But in terms of signings for our first team I don't know why we'd sign any midfielders unless we're talking about putting Gerrard and Lucas on the bench.

We're now playing 4-3-3, Rodgers' ideal formation (and justifiably so, given how well we've pressed and countered in it). 2 of those 3 midfield slots are very energy-consuming with the level of pressing asked of them. We have 5 players for those 3 slots; one of those players has been injury-prone for 3 seasons now, another is 33. We're almost undoubtedly going to be in Europe next season (hopefully in the competition worth being in Europe for). We absolutely need depth, and we absolutely need to get used to benching certain players - especially Lucas and Gerrard.

Also, there's a fallacy about signing ""a capable striker off the bench"" - if they're a capable striker, why would they be happy with being on the bench? Hernandez types are rare as fuck. Given his form at Sunderland I'd be happy with Borini as a backup, and interested to see how he does in what is now a much more potent Liverpool team than the one he left. 

Assuming Suarez stays, what we need in the summer is:

- Two new fullbacks, one for each flank. The right-back is based on speculation Johnson won't be getting a new contract and will be made available for transfer (wages don't match performance). 

- At least one new CM option. And not an ""all-rounder"" like Henderson/Allen - either a true DM, or a CM that can provide end product and a goal threat. 

- 2 wide options: Right now, our legitimately good options for the front 3 in the 4-3-3 are Suarez, Sturridge, Sterling, and Coutinho - who is now playing better in central midfield. That's absolutely not enough depth. Add Borini back in next season and we're still short.

true,DerGregorian,lfc68,,"The meaning of #10 has changed a little recently due to the more attacking nature of some players. I prefer to use the italian terms because they're more well defined. 


Take Oscar (Someone who Coutinho is compared with) who plays more as a trequartista, sitting further up in the hole and provides a more direct threat whilst still being able to act as a playmaker is what most consider a #10 now.

Coutinho of late is playing more of a regista role, sits deeper with Henderson and is allowed more time and space which is when he's able to pick out those brilliant through balls and make use of his smart footwork and vision. He's seems to enjoy getting more involved in the play and is more physical. 

Out wide he tended to get lost and looked isolated which is why I think his form nose dived as much as it did. One of the main reasons we were after Kono and Salah is because of this, gives us more wide options with Moses playing like arse and frees Coutinho up to play in a much better suited central role. With the likes of Allen and Lucas of late being asked to play more attacking it seems BR has found his formation of choice.

On a side note, it is actually questionable whether this new upper class/wealthy elite *are* actually subject to the same legal stringency as poorer people, for example the Expenses Scandal, the fact no one has really been prosecuted for the banking crisis despite some *very* deviant things going on, or, what I feel is the main one, tax avoidance (whilst it may not be illegal, I feel it is certainly deviant, being morally equivalent or at least comparable to straight up tax fraud.)

I hate that the moment someone says ""I am a student and I drink the cheap bottles of cider"", people jump onto the whole mentality of ""BOOO, binge drinking! BOOO, students only go to Uni to get smashed every day!"" but they're missing the point.  

When I was a skint student and there was a flat party with friends, obviously a cheap bottle of cider like White Ace is going to be more attractive than ""expensive"" booze. Why would I spend £12 on a crate of beer when I could spend £4 for pretty much the same amount of alcohol?  

It's the stigma attached to cheap booze. I had Uni friends joke around that I was an ""alky"" because I drank Frosty Jacks, yet those same people drank the same amount of alcohol, even more sometimes, than me but they drank nice bottles of wine instead. What's the difference?  

In fact, the worst binge drinkers and the students who got in a complete mess the most, were the students who spent a fortune on booze. £20 bottle of vodka, £16 on Apple Sourz, and an £8 bottle of wine - £44 for one night. *And that was just pre-drinking before their night out*.

true,evilcleverdog,wales-pembrokeshire,Pembrokeshire,"&gt; Correct me if I am wrong, but (even though i think it's a good thing to pay more) if everyone starts paying workers more, wouldn't the prices go up again and they would be stuck in the same situation?

Correct. That is usually what happens. However, raising wages as the government presently does can increase an individual's ability to afford imported goods. Then again there is another problem; buying imported goods causes jobs to dwindle.

I personally think it would be better to make minimum wage based on a company's revenue. Let's say 10% of all products sold would be split amongst workers evenly based on hours. So, companies who make less can pay a little less, and those who make more (revenue wise) can reward their employees. A long time ago this would be very unrealistic, but since accounting is computer based it's entirely possible.

There are several advantages to this idea...

1. It does not create a greater burden on smaller businesses. Since wages can vary, a business owner who isn't doing as well can pay less, but percent-wise the same as others.

2. There is ""upward mobility,"" meaning as a company becomes more successful employees will too. You won't have to ask for pay raises or promotions.

3. If the prices of stuff goes up, so does an employees wages, so it balances out.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Less so than roads, by quite a large amount in fact. Then you have the lower maintenance costs (did you know a bike is about 6-900x less damaging to a road than a car?)

Yes but roads are more valuable than cycle lanes. Cycling is not really that popular here.

It's a massive risk to spend all that money when you don't know that there will be a reasonable takeup in cycling.

&gt;Well ofcourse - but so do roads and so do drivers in their single occupancy cars. One of the purposes of introducing cycle lanes is to get people out of their cars. Not just to benefit would be cyclists, but to benefit pedestrians and car users.

But again, many many more people drive, and cars are much, much faster.

I've no doubt that there would be benefits, but the majority of people in this county would I'm sure rather the money be spent on more infrastructure for cars.

People don't want to get out of their cars.

&gt;A bit of a non issue - most (lets say 90%) cycle within the confines of towns and cities. While it would be wonderfully to have a cycling freeway I don't think its high on anyone's priorities right now.

What I *don't* understand is how that affects our matchday approach. We go out every match and try to win it. There are very few games for Liverpool where we would say ""eh, lets just settle for a draw"" but if there was such a game, it would be against the league leaders. Instead, we go out like a rocket, throw caution to the wind and demolish them. 

At the Etihad - arguably another game where we ought to be a bit less expansive - we took them on and it nearly paid off.

I don't think Rogers is playing for a position in the league. He is assessing every team we play on an individual basis and trying to work out how to *beat* them. The fact that we have a target of 4th clearly doesn't come into his thinking.

Immigration is a vital component of the economic strength of a country, especially in the case of the UK where there is a growing demographic bulge toward older (non working age) people. Simply put, we need immigrants of working age to move here, pay taxes and support our economy.

The counter to this argument is that 'many don't pay taxes and take welfare' but this is a very small minority isn't it?

So you are left with the ideological opposition to immigration I was talking about. To me this ideology just reeks of xenophobia ... perhaps that's being a little unfair to those who vote UKIP and clearly, genuinely, feel that their identity is being threatened but is that worth effectively reducing the labour pool?

&gt;**The work-related activity group**

&gt;If it is decided that you do not have a limited capability for work-related activity, you will be placed in the work-related activity group of claimants. You will have to adhere to strict work-related conditions in order to continue receiving the benefit in full. This may involve attending further work-focused interviews in addition to the initial work-focused interview.

&gt;These interviews will normally take place each month and at them the personal adviser will try to help you back into work. The adviser will draw up an ‘action plan’, which will outline the activities that you could undertake to help you move into work.
You cannot be required, as part of a work related activity, to apply for a job, undertake paid work or voluntary work or undergo medical treatment.
You will also not be required to take part in work related activity if:

&gt;you are in the ESA support group
you are a lone parent and you have a child under the age of 5
you receive carers allowance or a carer’s premium

&gt;If you are a lone parent and you have a child under the age of 5 or you receive carers allowance you will still have to attend an initial work focused interview (see paragraph 7).

&gt;If you are a lone parent with a child under the age of 13 you may only be required to undertake work related activity during the child’s normal school hours.

Historical records show that the current batch of weather events have occurred in the past and were just as severe.  It's a cyclic event that occurs every 3-400 years and the guilty culprit is entirely linked to our elliptical orbit around the sun. Our planet is in a constant state of flux with the global temperature going up and down all the time.  Anyone who denies climate change or fails to see the connection between weather patterns and this change is just plain ignorant.

Our magnetic field and atmosphere work together to redirect most of the sun's energy away from the earth but when Aphelion (furthest point from the sun) and Perihelion (closest point to the sun) align up with our magnetic poles as they have done this year (July 5th Aphelion and Jan 4th for Perihelion) they aren't as effective as normal so absorb more energy than usual.  This is why the gulf stream has moved.  All that extra energy the northern hemisphere absorbed 6 months ago is being radiated back into space making for some very odd weather.  There is absolutely nothing that can be done about this kind of climate change other than blowing up Jupiter, Saturn and every other astral body that effects our orbit.

The sad fact is that this weather is going to be with us for another couple of years yet so better brace yourself.  I feel sorry for Australia in about 6 months time when they start radiating.

Build it and they will come and all that..

In towns and cities that's debatable - over long distances I agree.

But the bike is perfect for short distances. No one expects a cycle network that connects London with say Scotland. No one would cycle that (other than numpties like me of course).

&gt;People don't want to get out of their cars.

Cambridge disagrees - And so does London ....As do kids who would like to cycle to say school but cannot because of the dangers.

But realistically there is truth to both of our statements.

But consider London - In parts of London 25% of traffic is cyclists. They cycle in one of the most dangerous cities in the UK with little/no good cycling infrastructure. Imagine the numbers of cycling uptake if infrastructure was made safe for all.

Now the child is a bit slow (I've literally *heard* how they raised him and it doesn't surprise me). So they get benefits for that which is fair enough but then, as the father doesn't live there they are able to claim excess benefits as there's no household income. Bare in mind, the father is there *every single day* and has his own job. Yet, as he doesn't stay the night there, he leaves at 2am every morning and goes to work in the early hours.. Eats all his meals there and so on. He's not a registered tenant. So, it's clear his money is going into this household as they have a sky subscription, eat takeaways virtually every night and god only knows what else but they are able to claim more benefits because he is nowhere on the tenancy agreement.

These aren't an isolated cases. Guarantee this is happening many places. I'm not saying they lead glamours lives. Nor that they should be left to rot either. I feel the whole system needs better assessment as I feel it does loads of good, for people who **genuinely need** it. For the fraudsters and obese people, well there's schemes like the food bank and other stuff we spunk our taxes on which is more what we should be encouraging in those scenarios. I also think obesity shouldn't class as a disability. They should just get a free gym membership.

Man Utd have incredible spending power (still) and even if they are to finish 7-8th in the league this season, this doesn't mean that they won't be able to attract top playes. We've seen with the likes of Sigurðsson that even if you know the manager, a slightly higher figure on the pay check will get the signature.


If Ferguson (and I hope he does) sticks to his stubbornness and still insists Mediocre Moyes is the way forward for Man Utd, we might see him do some real damage to the club, but in terms of squad and reputation. I'm personally relishing the thought of the star player exodus that is bound to happen in the summer. Nobody is going to tell me that Rooney, van Persie or Mata WANT to play the style of football we watched against Fulham. And without Champions League, what is there to keep them from leaving? Loyalty to the club? We've all seen Rooney hijack the club for a wage demand more than once, what loyalty.

The signs are all there, but with Man Utds' immense global stature, big stadium and excellent sponsor backing, they will surely bounce back much quicker than Liverpool. Only in dream-bizzarro world does Man Utd go 24+ years without their next league trophy.

The AI specialism is pretty unique and pretty much the forefront of modern search and data mining.

Not caring might as well be opposition though. Nobody seems to be interested in cyclists.

Congestion just isn't a problem in most places.

Driving is the most comfortable, most practical, most fun, fastest method of transport for just about every journey that I'm likely to make. The only time I don't drive is if something is within reasonable walking distance or if I plan on having a drink.

For me right now Reddit is the most effective information and media sharing platform, and you can easily bounce one level higher to /r/championship or /r/soccer for wider discussion. Plus Reddit users are more likely to stop off here whilst checking out their other stuff.

[Here is a reasonable Twitter list of QPR related accounts](https://twitter.com/KakoLDN/lists/qpr) (players and fans etc.). You will occasionally/often have to grimace through some of the non-football related opinions, but it's a good source for the flavour of fan reactions after a game or noteworthy club event.

[There's a weekly podcast called Open All R's](http://playbackmedia.co.uk/podcasts/qprpodcast/). Usually pretty good. I prefer it when the Northern Irish guy is presenting.

[Loft for Words](http://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/queensparkrangers/) offers pretty entertaining pre- and post- match analysis. The head honcho there does live text football commentary online for one of the bigger papers here. He also sometimes writes for the official matchday program and appears on the podcast above. I find the forum here reasonable too, and good for fans attending matches' feedback.

In terms of other resources...

[qpr.org](http://www.qprdot.org/viewforum.php?f=12) is fine, reasonable activity levels.

[We Are the Rangers Boys](http://www.wearetherangersboys.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?11-QPR-FANS) is...an acquired taste. Reminds me of pubs back in the 80's, for some reason. Still worth checking out for post-match reactions from attending fans' feedback.

[QPR Report](http://qprreport.proboards.com/board/3) - I don't check this much but it appears to be pretty active and civilised.

[Not 606's QPR forum](http://www.not606.com/forumdisplay.php/51-Queens-Park-Rangers) seems to attract a lot of the international crowd.

[IndyR's](http://www.indyrs.co.uk/) - Match reports, history, seems like a decent crowd. Forum slow compared to the others.

Potentially I agree.

The issue though goes back to government making long term plans for the betterment of the nation that the average Joe knows little or cares little about.

&gt;Congestion just isn't a problem in most places.

Sure - but it's a massive potential elephant in the room that someone will need to tackle. Cycling/walking/public transport are the 3 main initiatives to solve the problem - before it becomes a problem. 

More cars for example is not the right approach.

&gt;Driving is the most comfortable, most practical, most fun, fastest method of transport for just about every journey that I'm likely to make.

And is (like it or not) comes with a great many negative effects on society. And some/many simply cannot afford it anymore.

Does the average person think about this? Probably not, does that make it fair or right though? No I don't believe it does.

That's what we've been doing till now; I think the reason we're now looking at moving him on is that his contract will have 1 year left on it at the end of this season, and talks thus far have not progressed satisfactorily (I imagine we're trying to reduce his wage and/or get a performance-based contract in place, and he's less than keen on this).

&gt; Left back, maybe someone like Shaw?

I'm resigned to Chelsea getting him, but yeah he'd be fantastic. Alberto Moreno at Sevilla is another name that's been doing the rounds, but again other teams will be interested. Think he might be more likely than Shaw, though. Also, quite frankly, I don't think we've any particular need to pay British premiums for players - we've got plenty of England-grown and home-grown players, both in the current squad and coming through. Ricardo Rodriguez at Wolfsburg looks good...

&gt; Midfield - Rakitic?

Yeah, he'd be tops, huh?

&gt; On the flanks, perhaps Assaidi deserves another go?...Or maybe he couldn't get a sale, so loan was lesser of two evils

I think that was the reason - I mean, we loaned him out and then replaced him with Victor Moses, so it's clear Rodgers didn't rate him, even for depth. I also don't think we should be looking for backup/squad players - Konoplyanka looks a player who is potentially of genuine top-4 / CL quality, and that's what we should be after.

Evari answered this one, but to add a bit:

If you're saving for a pension, then there's also a SIPP. You don't pay capital gains on the return, and your income tax liability is reduced by how much you put in (so it's functionally the same as investing before the first round of taxing).

However, there are a lot of limits on withdrawing (most importantly that the money is locked away until you're 55). As far as tax goes, you're taxed as though it's income when you take money out, so you're kinda deferring the tax (although since you're likely to be withdrawing less than you currently earn, it'll save you money).

I understand your concern but there are certain things you can be fairly certain based on the survey statistics. For reference you can read this - 

http://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm

Other than that a sample size of 200(as of now) is fairly good in estimating even for a population size of 10000(size of our sub), at 95% confidence intervals. This is more true for questions that have a huge portion of answers for certain answers (you can think of country of residence, rival, gender etc). 

There are some biases and certain things to consider as well - 

* The average number online in this sub at any time is around 200 at best (with a few exceptions).
* Most of such people are the same people.
* People tend to have selective biases.
* The post only stays relevant if it is in the vicinity of the front page, otherwise it is as good as dead, and there is no point to wait for more responses.
* The survey cannot be 5 pages long with  a lot of subjective answers. That will take a lot of analysis and time for one person to compile.

I tried my best to do as good as i could. I originally did not intend to do this survey. I saw other surveys with questions like who do you want to buy, and a very constrictive option choice; So, I just made this to give ourselves a brief but a more objective idea of what things we like or what we don't.

I do invite any of you to do a better job as it surely can be done. I am happy to offer my services if you need it in any sense.

It sucks for the minority, but it's better the money gets spent somewhere it can actually do some good rather than being wasted on initiatives that probably won't work to help a small number of people.

Spending $40k to protect a dozen houses and a farm from *the sea* is not as effective spending as the same amount to protect four dozen houses and twenty businesses from a small river.

* Feels sorry for United, Moyes has the experience to get through it.

* Liverpool are in a similar position with us. They didn't start the season as favourites like us. Similar team. The fact they don't have CL football makes a real difference.

* [Knows Mel from Spain. He likes to play football.](https://twitter.com/chelseafc/status/432882870986612736)

* If Toure isn't suspended it sends the message you can do what you want as long as the ref doesn't see. Doesn't matter about cameras.

* The individual awards should be for the winners. Bale was special last year but normally it should go for a United player. Jose always votes for a player from the champions.

* Football is about teams, not players.

Teams will be locked in their boxes, breaking under constant pressure. 

Did you see the game yesterday, can you imagine what this man can do with 200m when he settles down, integrates his vision into the club, brings the right kind of man. You can laugh but do you remember the start of the legendary Alex Ferguson or for more recent examples even this Brendan Rodgers. 

Man with a vision and this kind of determination to succeed need time and full backing. We, as Liverpool fans, should know better and hope for the sacking or the history might repeat itself.

Sturridge has always been a great player but, in the past, his skill has definitely been masked by poor tactics or less quality teammates. The kid is amazing. With the right psychology (possibly attributable to Peters but also his renewed religious faith*), he's a complete monster up front.

Why is it wrong?  The alcohol industry dictates social policy through advertising and costings, hence their vehement opposition of MUP.  Is liver-damaging behaviour something we should be promoting by lack of condemnation as a society?

&gt;Education and healthcare are the proper tools for this kind of thing. 

Fair viewpoint, but I think it's quite naive.  Alcohol education programs are historically useless at getting drinkers to drink less, and they cost a lot. 



Liver disease is silent until you turn up at the doctors feeling like shite and are told you have irreversible cirrhosis and you have to stop drinking immediately or die/get a transplant within 18-months.  Healthcare is definitely NOT the place to deal with alcohol-related disease - it needs to be dealt with far, far sooner.  Ergo, preventive measures that aren't overly reliant on education: curb advertising and promotion of booze and raise the price.

A bottle of spirits is now ~3x cheaper than 3 decades a go. It has never, ever, been cheaper to get smashed than it is now.

&gt; This leads me on to another thought, would £10k, for example, be better invested in ISAs (mix of index tracker and cash as mentioned above) or better paid off as overpayment against my mortgage, currently at 4

Tricky. 4-5 years is a reasonably short timeframe for investments, so you could see the figure go down or up. A 4.1% guaranteed return is pretty decent though.

Could go either way. If you're splitting it as cash/trackers then you'll need your tracker to make something like an 8% return over the next few years. Could easily beat that, but it's also not guaranteed. The decision will depend on your plans and attitude to risk.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"As you said, when you lay out a team on paper you give it a formation (e.g. 4-4-2, 3-5-2, 4-3-3), this captures the roles and positions of the players. Note that formations are different when attacking and defending, in the 3-5-2 you run 3 centre backs and 2 wing backs (winger/defender hybrids, I think Rose would fit this style as he is quick and aggressive). On defence it looks more like a 5-3-2. Another example, AVB's 4-3-3 would really change to a 3-5-3 on attack, one of the midfielders (Sandro or Capoue) would drop back splitting the CB's allowing the FB's to push up the pitch and 'unlock' the wide men (Lamela/Eriksen/Chadli/Siggurdson could then drift inside). What is important is that depending on formation, player roles change. A CM in Sherwoods 4-4-2 behaves differently to a CM in AVB's 4-3-3 (touched on below), thus, the attributes valued can change multiple times in a game.

Now, depending on the formation each position will require different attributes, a 3-5-2 doesn't have a full back, AVB's 4-3-3 had two aggressive fullbacks and in older formations the fullback rarely pushed forward. AVB tried to make the players fit his formation (for the most part), you can probably call this tactical inflexibility, he was going to run some variant of 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 regardless of who he had (e.g. Soldado persistence, inverted winger persistence, loss of stability after Sandro injury), another philosophy is to pick your best 11 and base the system on that (e.g. City, they have revived the 4-4-2 to some degree in order to accommodate the striking talent they have). At the moment Sherwood has spurs running an attacking [4-3-3](http://outsideoftheboot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/FORMATION-11.jpg) but has also used a 'lopsided' 4-4-2 (Eriksen drifts in, Rose provides width). 

Rather than AVB's textbook 4-3-3, which had movement patterns for players to follow on transition, Sherwood emphasises a 'don't be an idiot' strategy. If Dembele goes forward, Bentaleb should drop back to accommodate and vice-versa. If Rose pushes forward, Eriksen should come inside (also same movement in reverse pattern). This makes the most of the fact that Paulinho/Dembele are both astute defenders AND attackers, it would be a terrible game plan if you had Modric/Parker in midfield as one is clearly defensively minded and the other a rat-faced attacking God.

Thing is, Sherwood isn't really a formation kind of guy, with AVB you could easily say ""we neeed a sweeper keeper to fit the high line and an inverted winger to play the Hulk role"". Sherwood seems happy to pick the guys who are best in training and giving a formation afterwards, it makes it a little harder to rate players because it is tough to easily nail down what we need and what attributes are valuable. For example, I consider Lloris among the best sweeper keepers in the world (his willingness to come off the line), he works wonderfully in AVB's formation, but I think he wouldn't be rated as highly if he played for Man U -who tend to sit deeper, proving more space in front of defence.

What is your strikers conversion rate? Aerial ability? Hold up play like? Can he drop when required? Can he play the lone role? Some of those questions aren't important depending on your system. Lone role doesn't matter in 4-4-2, aerial ability doesn't matter for Arsenal who like to weave it along the ground etc. It's pretty hard to say who is good/bad currently, but I will try below:

Lloris: Amazing shot stopper, committed in aerial disputes and quick thinking. He is succeptable to brain explosions (see City away). One of, if not our best players. Friedel is adequate cover. 10/10

Walker: Pacey, willingness to support the RW on attack, can take free kicks, strong defender (able to shield the ball well), known to have bad days where he throws the game away for the team (vs Chelsea at home last season). Naughton is adequate cover. 7/10

Dawson: Strong in the air, good captain, can rise to the occasion at times, slow, mental lapses. Kaboul is poor cover due to injuries. 5/10

Vertonghen: Wonderful positional awareness, strong in the air, strong in the tackle, strong going forward, can be outpaced by certain players (Navas, Walcott etc). Chiriches is wonderful cover. 10/10

Rose: Great at attacking/crossing, good tackler, alright in the air granted height, over commits on attack at times failing to track back, suspect positional awareness at times. Fryers is poor cover. 3/10

Sandro: Strong interceptor of the ball, good short range distribution, decent in the air, strong in the tackle. Mediocre going forward. Capoue is good cover. 8/10

Dembele: One of the best dribblers in the league, strong passer, strong defensively, very hard to dispossess, doesn't shoot/score often, long term injury concern. Siggurdson is decent cover, but could be improved. 7/10

Paulinho: Can be anonymous in games. Able to pick a pass ~~and can shoot~~. Bentaleb is decent cover. 5.5/10

Eriksen(-sen-sen): Creative attacker, can thread a pass, set piece threat, can play in multiple positions, can score, weak in the air and not strong defensively. Holtby is good cover. 8/10

Lennon: Tracks back on defence, pacey, poor end product. Lamela is expected to snatch this position. 4/10

Adebayor: Strong in the air, amazing hold up play, can drop deep and hold the ball up, decent striker, serious attitiude problem. Soldado is inadequate as backup in the league. 4/10

Based on this I see the need to strengthen at LB and striker. It is also important that we retain Lloris and Vertonghen and integrate Lamela.

The Gerrard/Henderson connection could be key in a team that wanted to be aggressive and press high. If you were to add players like Rooney, Townsend, and Lallana, that'd be a very aggressive side. (Not sure who do play at CB. Cahill's form is too inconsistent for me. And Terry is far too slow to play out from the back.)

However, I expect Hodgson won't begin to consider that. He'll revert to a 4-4-2 (or similar) and have flying wingers (Sterling, I hope, being one of them) charging down the wings, with the goal of flinging balls across the box for headers or tap-ins. We won't see him use Sterling's speed, Sturridge's ability in tight spaces, Henderson's aggression, or Flanagan and Johnsons' ability to overlap.

It's like ""dentist endorse..."" - we've got two dentists, and we paid him fifty grand apiece.

And when it's used in newspapers it isn't much better; tabloids use ""research"" or ""surveys"" to generate non-news stories to fill quiet days.

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"There are no cut and dried metrics to evaluate how a player does, at pretty much any position, even goalkeeper and striker (though those positions are easier to describe what ""good"" players do there). Here's a quick run down of positions and what attributes those players should have.

**Central Defender** (aka Center-Half, Center Back, CB)
   The most defensive players on the field; rarely go forward, except for corners, where they use their height to try and score headers. Need to be physically large (6' or taller is usually considered a must for CB's) and positionally sound, as they are basically the last line of defense. Tackling and Marking ability is also needed. As their name suggests, they play in the center of the park, and in England especially, generally as a pair.
 - Notable players; [Ledley King](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lptxqIEIHKc),[Fabio Cannavaro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV9bhPBPBKk)

**Fullback** (aka Right- or Left- back, FB, or RB/LB)
   Similar to the Central Defender, they are primarily defensive players
who guard the flanks in defense. They are generally smaller, faster, and more skilled with the ball at their feet than Central Defenders. They are also more often encouraged to get forward, though their primary responsibility is still defensive. They are generally played as a pair, one on each side of defense. *note* Some teams prefer to play what are called ""Wingbacks"" - fullbacks who generally play without another wide player in front of them. Wingbacks, strictly speaking, are wide players, nominally defenders, who are responsible for one whole flank of the field by themselves, and are less defensive than fullbacks. Often, very skilled attacking fullbacks will be described as wingbacks, though this is rarely strictly true.
 - Notable players; Kyle Walker, [Philip Lahm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cou-CLnH0KU)

**Defensive Midfielder** (aka Holding Midfielder, DM)
   A Midfielder whose primary responsibilities are defensive. Unlike other midfielders, he rarely joins the attack, instead sitting back (holding) behind the rest of the midfield to provide support once the opposition has possession. He is often seen tackling and intercepting passes in midfield. Like central defenders, needs good marking and tackling skills, as well as stamina to run constantly. However, he also needs to be able to play with the ball at his feet, as he is still a midfielder. Holding Midfielders are generally deployed alone, and centrally. 
 - Notable players; Etienne Capoue, [Claude Makelele](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63WojjZy7QE)

**Central Midfielder** (CM)
   The “quintessential midfielder, has too many roles to realistically address in one paragraph. The best have nearly every quality needed of a footballer; speed (pace, in british terms), skill with the ball, passing vision, tackling ability, size, a good shot… the list goes on. Instead of trying to talk about everything in one paragraph, I’ll simply break down some of  the most common roles of a CM.

- **Box-to-Box midfielder**; A more attacking central mid, the box-to-box player needs boundless energy to gallop up and down the field, making runs in attack, winning the ball back in defense, and generally appearing everywhere on the field. The Box-to-Box midfielder is often less adept as a creative passer, preferring to do most of his work off the ball making runs. - Examples; [Paulinho](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f86d9NZCUU), Michael Bradley, [Yaya Toure](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOt1P9yJrLs).

- **Deep-Lying Playmaker**; the opposite of a box-to-box player, the Deep-Lying Playmaker prefers to sit centrally, not moving about the pitch as much. However, as the name implies, they are responsible for the creative passing that can quickly turn defense into attack. He anchors the team and helps control the middle of the field. - Examples; [Luca Modric](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB0sJA6SK5I), [Xavi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45G0egeyK20).

- **Ball-Winning Midfielder**; similar to the defensive midfielder, but much more focused and often deployed further forward, the Ball-Winning midfielder sits back in attack, supporting but not taking an active role. However, in defense, he is a homing missile, attempting to win back the ball as quickly as possible and restart the attack. The main thing that separates him from the holding midfielder is that he is more involved in the attack, as a “safety valve” and ball-mover. Examples; [Sandro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ-1M0ACt8M).
 
These three roles are by no means the only ways a Central Midfielder can play, but they are three of the most common archetypes. Other notable players include [Zinedine Zidane](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7mXGMcpA0g) and [Steven Gerrard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3offv9FL79Y).

**Wide Midfielder** (often, Right- and Left- Midfielder)
 Wide midfielders are basically a cross between central midfielders and full-backs. They are responsible for both supporting the attack and covering in defense. Like Central midfielders, they are generally skilled in most aspects of being a good footballer, but more emphasis is placed on passing ability and pace, with a premium on crossing ability; the ability to play long passes from wide areas into the box, providing width to the attack by pulling defenders out to the wings. **Wingers** are similar to Wide midfielders, but have fewer if any defensive responsibilities, focusing primarily in attack. Wingers are to Wide Midfielders what Wingbacks are to Fullbacks; a more attacking version, though Wingers are almost never deployed as the only wide players on the field. Examples; Andros Townsend, Aaron Lennon, [David Beckham](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqaLBYcBi1E).

**Inside Forward** (aka Inverted Winger)
   More of a role than a true position, inside forwards are wide players who are deployed on the flank opposite their strongest foot; right-footed players play on the left flank, left-footed players on the right flank. They, like wingers, are primarily attacking players, but instead of providing width in attack, they cut inside of fullbacks and wide defenders, attempting to either shoot on their stronger foot, or receive passes coming through the defense. This role has become more common recently; it was very rare even 10 years ago. Inside Forwards have few, if any, defensive responsibilities, and require speed, a strong shot, and good dribbling skills. Notable players; [Gareth Bale](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHsIzHLctgI), [Arjen Robben](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY6CVJfbaSY).

**Attacking midfielder** (Trequartista, #10, CAM)
   A version of the central midfielder, but they play further up the field, and contribute much more to attack than defense. They are often expected to be the creative force in a team, playing passes to unlock the defense and getting other attacking players involved. There are a variety of ways to play this position, just like the Central Midfield, but they are all creative players who look to score goals and/or create opportunities for teammates to score. Must have good skills on the ball, as well as good passing skills and vision. Notable players; Christian Eriksen, [Rafael van der Vaart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_wpaVQjZrk), [Juan Mata](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZnRP_AcBi4), [Cristiano Ronaldo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S4XVJeern0), [Leo Messi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cBIAwh4EjA)

BBC and Chanel 4 producers for years have been trying to get women on their panels whenever they can as an internal rule. The problem is that because there are so much fewer female comedians in the industry, all the funny ones are a sought after commodity. Booked up with tours, writing scripts, filming shows or otherwise unavailable for whatever reason. 

High level male comedians however are over saturated in the industry. There are simply too many. So no matter when you will always have access to dozens of top level male comedians available to do the show. And they will take it because unlike their female counterparts on the same level most of them dont get 20+ offers a month.

How many great female standup comedians are there right now in the UK? one-two dozen? ( three??).  How many have a comedic style that lends itself to a panel show rather than monologue, sketch or crowd interaction? 10? 15? How many of those are available to film on next Tuesday in London? How many of those have already appeared on this season or have a contract with another panel show? The pool keeps shrinking fast.

You can tweak the numbers to some degree, but thats how it works. Meanwhile you have several hundred experienced and talented male standups to choose from at the same time. Is it any wonder panel shows are made up of mostly men?

Its a game of priorities, would you rather have the funniest level comedians on the show or always have at least one woman on the show even if we have to scrape the barrel to get it. Because right now you cant always have both

There's absolutely no reason for this to be true.

&gt;especially in the case of the UK where there is a growing demographic bulge toward older (non working age) people

Sounds like a mix of longer life and a move to less population growth in younger people, neither of which requires mass immigration to ""fix"", or even implies that anything is broken in the first place.

&gt;Simply put, we need immigrants of working age to move here, pay taxes and support our economy.

Why? Have you seen the unemployment figures lately - we don't have a problem with unfilled jobs crippling the economy, and going forward further automation will continue to reduce the demands on the workforce as it is. Even if asll that were false, why would immigration be the answer instead of promoting childbirth in the existing population?

&gt;Surely a logical cost/benefit analysis would always come down on the side of increasing immigration to benefit the economy?

Not at all. We're not an unskilled nation by any means, and the majority of immigration workers are performing unskilled work that literally anyone could do.

In response to what you've said, I'll have a stab at explaining how satellite piracy works. (As I understand it, cable piracy is much harder ever since Virgin Media upgraded its encryption to system called Nagra 3). What I write below is a brief summary and parts may be slightly incorrect as it's been a while since I last looked into this.

---

Satellite piracy uses a system called 'cardsharing' which is exactly what the name suggests.

To begin, you'll have to fork out on a custom satellite receiver. Usually, these are Linux based satellite boxes that can handle third-party plugins.

After that, assuming you want to access pay TV services, you'll have to buy yourself access to a cardsharing server where the CS server owner is essentially uploading data from their card onto a webserver, sort of. 

Access to these servers can range between £52-120 a year for the entire HD package 'with the full shebang'. You can acquire a sub package with a CS server for as long as you want (i.e. weekly, monthly or yearly)

Once you've done this, you set up your Linux based set-top box to connect to the aforementioned c/s server via the internet where it periodically receives card data that provides you with the entitlements to access pay TV services.

---

There are some risks associated with using CS servers. The biggest being you pay for access to a server which later stops working. The last thing you wan to hear is the guy you've paid has just done a runner with yours and everybody else's money.

As I've mentioned, this whole scheme relies on a working internet connection so if your connection drops out, you'll lose access to your encrypted channels.

You'll also face problems if your CS server goes down or is over-subscribed.

So i'm going to speak very very simply. [Use this formation template to understand who and where i'm talking about.](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PYGgU.png)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Goalkeeper (GK):** Literally, the Goalkeeper has to keep the Goal clear. In other words, he has to stop the ball from getting into the net. Allowed to use their hands, Goalkeepers are fundamentally shot stoppers. Look at [Lloris' save yesterday](http://gfycat.com/NervousSafeAmbushbug) to see what this means. Goalkeepers take goal kicks, command their defence during corners, free-kicks etc. and they can also play an important part in strategy, as they have the best view of the field. GKs are often captains because of this reason.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Defender:** I'll look at each position in more detail, but the primary role of the defender is two-part: 

1) Stop the opposition from scoring a goal

2) Support the midfielders and forwards

**Centre-back (CB):** The 2 central defenders simply have to stop the opposition players, particularly the strikers, from getting into the area and scoring. They are often tall and strong, with good jumping, heading and tackling ability. They also need to be able to concentrate, read the game well, and be brave in decision making. Take a look at [this famous tackle by Ledley King.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjxmyjLp9tg) Because of these attributes, CBs will often go forwards for set piece corners or free-kicks to provide an aerial goal threat. [Watch Vertonghen score this header against Inter.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkLaZkqlpIE)

**Sweeper (SW):** A sweeper, as the name suggests, 'sweeps up' the ball if the opponent manages to breach the defensive line. The sweeper's ability to read the game is even more vital than for a centre-back. The SW is not used much anymore because most teams opt to play the Offside trap instead.

**Full-back (LB &amp; RB):** The full-backs play a similar role to the CBs but are responsible for stopping wide players (Wingers, who we will discuss later) rather than Centre-forwards. Full-backs tend not to go up to support the attack like CBs do, but Wing-backs do.

**Wing-back (LWB &amp; RWB):** A wing-back is, essentially, an attacking full-back. Kyle Walker is an excellent example. The wing-back is one of the most physically demanding positions in modern football, and Wing-backs need to have exceptional stamina to run up and down the field all day. [Watch some Leighton Baines to get an idea.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RYnTrmmdY)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Midfielder:** Midfielders are the players in between the defenders and the attackers. It is often said that games are won or lost in midfield, because a midfield that dominates is able to dictate the game. Their role is extremely versatile, and there are many many different types. Their main duties, however, are:

1) To get the ball

2) To keep the ball

3) To pass the ball to the attackers

**Centre-midfielder (CM):** Steven Gerrard. Yaya Toure. Bastian Schweinsteiger. CMs provide the link between defence and attack. They play right in the middle of the field, so have an all-round view of the match. This means they are often team captains, and you'll see them shouting a lot. Steven Gerrard is the best example. CMs need good vision and have great stamina. They sometimes run back to help the defence, and sometimes run forward to help the attackers. 

**Defensive midfielder (DM):** Sandro. Etienne Capoue. Scott Parker. A defensive midfielder is a CM who 'hangs back', infront of the defenders, to provide more defensive protection. DMs have to win the ball back before the opposition gets near the defence. They need to have a good work rate, good anticipation and be big. Very big. They are the 'anchors'. [Watch some Sandro here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ-1M0ACt8M)

**Attacking midfielder (AM):** Luka Modric. Cristian Eriksen. Moussa Dembele. The opposite of a defensive midfielder, the AM has to be creative, have great vision and have excellent technical ability. They can also often shoot from range. [Take a look at some Luka Modric to get an idea, as he is probably the best AM in the world right now.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA4CCs4kvTo)

**Wide midfield (LM &amp; RM):** Gareth Barry. Adam Johnson. David Beckham. Also know as 'wingers', these players play a similar role to the CM, but on the wings. They are also similar to Wing-backs. They are typically fast and excellent crossers of the ball. [Take a look at some Adam Johnson to see some typical Wide midfied play.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFvca4UlSOI)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Forwards:** Forwards are the attacking players. Their role is either to score goals, or to create scoring chances for the other attackers.

**Centre-forward (CF):** Sergio Aguero. Luis Suarez. Jermain Defoe. A CF, or striker, has one job: score goals. He is the focal point of attacking play. He is the target man. He is the finisher. [Watch Berbatov's time at Spurs to get a good idea of what a CF is meant to do.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnz6_NvSWPk)

**Winger (LW &amp; RW):** Gareth Bale. Cristiano Ronaldo. Erik Lamela. These are wingers. A winger is an attacking player who is stationed in a wide position near the touchlines. They are 'outside forwards', or advanced wide midfielders. They are fast. Very fast. And excellent dribblers. [Just watch Gareth Bale destroy Inter Milan. And try not to cry.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvF1VvKopHg)

He hasn't played 4-4-2 once with England... It's usually 4-2-3-1, which is the perfect system for us because it allows Sturridge to sit up top and Rooney to play behind him, as well as having two wingers/cams.


&gt;We won't see him use Sterling's speed, Sturridge's ability in tight spaces, Henderson's aggression, or Flanagan and Johnsons' ability to overlap.

No we won't see flanagan or Johnson, because Walker has been a lot lot better this season, and is probably the best attacking RB in the league on current form. 

The reason we might not see Sterling LW very often, is because Welbeck is a quality LW for England, and this season for United he has 9 goals in 12 games, and linked up with Sturridge brilliantly in our qualifiers. Sterling will be a great player, but he's only 19, and his finishing is not good enough at the moment.

You mentioned inverted wingers a few times. Sparklesnap discussed Wingers, but not specifically inverted wingers. Could you explain the role of an inverted winger?

What is the Hulk role? Would I not like the person in the Hulk role when they are angry?

You mentioned that Holtby is good cover for Eriksen. My understanding is that he's currently on loan to Fulham. Can he be recalled from his loan at any time if Eriksen were to be injured? Is there some penalty to Spurs if they chose to do so? There isn't a direct equivalent to loans in American sports and I am still somewhat unclear on the rules.

Could you expand on why you feel that Soldado is inadequate even in a backup role? I'm as frustrated as anybody with his lack of production from open play, but surely there must be some talent there for us to have shelled out such a large sum of money for his services.",0,1392046115,null,0,false,0,cfbpqkn,t3_1xinap,t1_cfbpqkn,t1_cfbogyh,null,1432334776,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

We didn't execute that successfully (or even really try to do so) and once the PL began were in a poor position to compete with others who better anticipated the revenue shift from gate to things like TV allocations and commercial dealings.  The rest as they say history.

The issue I see at United is good news/bad news.  Good news for you lot is you make a lot of money.  Bad news is you have the Glazers who are your own Moores' (to some degree) and are lining their pockets with your clubs money as well as having a poor manager and an aging squad massively in need of some serious investment.

[Hulk](http://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Photo/competitions/Comp_Matches/01/55/11/88/1551188_w2.jpg) is a Brazilian player who now plays in Russia but made his name at FC Porto in Portugal. He was a stand out player in AVB's undefeated season at the club. When I say 'Hulk role' I mean someone who fills the same role Hulk did at Porto, an inverted winger.

I doubt Holtby can be recalled under any conditions. If it was a year long loan then there likely would have been an option to recall at the midway point, but with it being 6 months I imagine there are no options. 

Soldado is about to turn 29 and has one goal from open play in 1600 minutes playing time. He clearly isn't working out and due to his age there really isn't much reason to persist with him. I would be happy to bring him on at the back end of games and start him in the EL if he was 22, but the guy is supposed to be in his prime now. Sometimes you just have to cut your losses.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I've said this before and I will say it again, Moyes was not the best man for the Man U job. The players that they have are not the ones that he can use for his system. Moyes plays classic direct football, United didn't 90% of the time under Fergie. The United players are completely different from the ones at Everton. They are more technically gifted, they have very good qualities that I don't think Moyes knows exactly how to accentuate. 

Moyes is still a very good manager. His work at Everton was admirable and I hope that he does something better than working at United. Also, I see United as a working project for the next few years. With more clubs getting more money, losing out in the transfer market, and falling behind clubs like City, Chelsea, and Arsenal, I can see United becoming like Liverpool over the past few years. 

Don't expect United to get close to administration or anything like us. They just need to rebuild a squad and hit a reset button on their clock. A year or two without Europe might be the best thing for them. Focus on the league, build up the tactics and youth, and fucking use the good players you have (Kagawa). 

I can honestly see Liverpool becoming like Arsenal over the next few years. Always challenging for the top 3 spots and then securing fourth in the last few matchdays. Chelsea and City are going to be unstoppable for the next few years, barring ownership issues, financial issues, or drastic managerial changes. Arsenal and Liverpool are going to be duking it out more often than not as the teams are in similar quality, but Wenger is a genius and may have the advantage. Without Champions League, Tottenham will always be challenging the Top 4 but will find it very difficult to break through and the same can be said for Everton as long as they keep hold of Martinez.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"This old canard.  Actually, if you unpackage share ownership in the UK the picture is very different from the one you paint.  You're right of course that many pension schemes invest in shares, but let's break this down a bit.  Firstly, individual share ownership has been falling since the sixties, and [currently amounts to just 10% of shares, with by far the largest chunk held by overseas investors](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8482601.stm).  In fact, the percentage of UK shares owned by overseas investors is now [well established as a majority, at over 53%](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/5dcf0dbc-25f9-11e3-aee8-00144feab7de.html#axzz2svqmpZZU) (a quarter by the US, an eighth by EU investors, and 5% by Asian investors).  [Insurance companies own 6.2%, down from a high of 23.6%.  Pension funds holdings have also fallen, from a high of 32% to **a new low of 4.7%**](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pnfc1/share-ownership---share-register-survey-report/2012/stb-share-ownership-2012.html).

So basically, unless you are one of the lucky 10%, or personally invest in a unit trust or something, your interest in the antics of the stock market is marginal at most (at least unless your employer goes bust).  Even if you do invest and/or have a pension, for much of the population, the amounts involved are [tiny](http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/dec/03/richest-10-uk-households-40-per-cent-wealth-ons).",0,1392048655,null,0,false,0,cfbqp76,t3_1xiaho,t1_cfbqp76,t1_cfbomvi,null,1432335230,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

When he arrived at the club, especially in AVB's formation, he was asked to be more of a link-up striker, which is something he's not remarkably good at(although he isn't horrible at it, either). He struggled early on with this and  as a result, it completely thrashed his confidence, which he has clearly not regained.

In his recent interview, he spoke of his anxiety when it comes to shooting when he's around the likes of Suarez etc. This might be a part of it - where he is in a position to shoot, he might consciously or unconsciously choose the more conservative option by focussing on hitting the target, as opposed to placing his shot in order to score. 

Anyone who has seen him in a Reserves game or playing for the U21/19/17 national teams knows that he can place shots and score goals. He just needs the experience/confidence to do this in the Premier League. 

Once he establishes his credentials and cements his confidence as a pacey dribbler, I would expect shooting will be the next big focus in his development.

Lifesaving clubs exist to train youngsters (and not-so-youngsters) up in the art of lifeguarding. Depending on which club you join there could be training every morning, twice a week or once a week.

Lifesaving consists of running, swimming, and use of rescue equipment such as rescue boards (big surf boards), small floats, boats, and kayaky-type-things (malibu boards). You have to have a very high standard of fitness to compete at high levels, but as long as you can swim and run you can participate no problem. 

All the clubs around bournemouth take part in summer events called twilights in which they compete to have the fastest competitors in events like the run-swim-run, beach flags(google it!), a 2K run, board races, surf-ski races (again, google!), relays, and sprints.

I'll link you to some of the bigger clubs:

http://www.oecd.org/els/mig/imo2013.htm

This is the OECD annual report on international migration. If you go to the 4th tab at the bottom you can compare the financial impact of immigration in all OECD countries. Including pensions, immigrants make a 0.46% contribution to the UK economy (this is essentially the cost/benefit analysis I spoke of); if you exclude pensions that figure increases to 1.02%.

The most interesting thing about those charts is how beneficial immigrants are to the Swiss and Luxembourg economies (due to how educated immigrants to these countries tend to be). Germany is also very low because of an amnesty on Turkish workers in the late 60's who are now reaching retirement age (note how the figure changes by a lot if you exclude pensions) - but communism and the East/West paradigm make Germany a special case in many ways ...

I also like to look across the Atlantic to the US to see what happens when you try to [restrict immigration](http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2012/05/17/the-law-of-unintended-consequences-georgias-immigration-law-backfires/) highlighting how important it is to large 21st century economies.

&gt;Sounds like a mix of longer life and a move to less population growth in younger people, neither of which requires mass immigration to ""fix"", or even implies that anything is broken in the first place.

The demographic bulge in the UK is a [well documented issue](http://www.un.org/en/globalissues/ageing/) that not many dispute. Whilst you are right in one sense; it is the symptom of success in medical advances and nutrition/living standards, it also poses many problems. In the media the term 'pensions crisis' is one way to characterize it, but it also has implications for our already creaking NHS and welfare system. [This FT article goes over some of the things society needs to change in order to solve the problem](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9ac81946-fae0-11e2-a7aa-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2sw44A7Kf) - it omits immigration but the argument for getting more women into the workplace is essentially the same: **Increase the tax base**.

&gt;Why? Have you seen the unemployment figures lately - we don't have a problem with unfilled jobs crippling the economy, and going forward further automation will continue to reduce the demands on the workforce as it is. Even if asll that were false, why would immigration be the answer instead of promoting childbirth in the existing population?

I can't really comment on this as it is a little speculative, but your last point regarding increasing levels of childbirth sounds a lot more difficult than you realize. Birthrates are at historic lows because of the cost of raising children, this is a real problem in the 1st world, one you can't really combat without extensive structural change in the economy. Immigration is significantly easier, 1st world countries can leverage their strength to attract people of working age.

&gt;Not at all. We're not an unskilled nation by any means, and the majority of immigration workers are performing unskilled work that literally anyone could do.

This is a bit of a stereotype. Around 32% of recent (2011) EEA immigrants and 43% of non-EEA immigrants had university degrees, compared with around 21% of the British adult population. I have heard people question the level of 'education' that non-EEA immigrants may have, but I'm not in any place to dispute the figures cited. Source: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24813467 or http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/11/04/uk-immigration-_n_4212431.html

NB: Those sources also highlight how EEA immigrants actually contribute, on average, more tax to the UK economy than UK nationals.

Sorry for the lengthy reply, I studied economics and statistics at university (boring, I know). I go back to my initial point though, opposition to immigration is based on ideology, because of this I can't agree with it.

Coutinho looks to have a hard time getting the ball as much as he'd like as a no. 10, and also it's clear that he's not a fully-formed player in final third yet -- far too wasteful around the opposition's box. Meanwhile, he's shown he has the workrate and tenacity to go with the best of them in midfield, especially with the likes of Stevie and Hendo around him.

He probably will be a terrific no. 10 one day, but don't let the jersey number and diminutive stature mislead you.

true,IntellegentIdiot,flair5,,"Just a word of warning: Amoung fans, at least in England, there's a sort of knowledge one-upmanship that goes on and people get hung up on saying things like ""you didn't know that!?"". It wouldn't be problem but those people often don't know themselves and a lot of misunderstandings occur as a result. It doesn't help that often pundits and commentators don't even know the rules themselves but speak with authority.

I'll give you an example from last nights MOTD2 regarding the penalty claim in our game yesterday. Martin Keown (ex-gooner) believed it wasn't a penalty becuase the Everton player was going down anyway and that's why the ref didn't give it. Robbie ""Lilly"" Savage (ex-journeyman player) yelled ""Why wasn't he booked then?!"" which was ignored because they were moving on. Perhaps I'm being unfair on Lilly but it appears he was suggesting the Everton player should be booked for diving. There's a strange myth that fans (and pundits) seem to believe that if a player goes down in the box it's either a penalty or that player should be booked for diving. This ignores the most common situation which is a player was tackled fairly and simply went down. Going down isn't automatically a foul, a player can trip over the opposing defender who has won the ball legally.

We have a vicious cycle where people don't want to be referees or quit refereeing because they are on the receiving end of abuse from people who don't understand the rules themselves and don't understand the job of a referee because they don't want to be on the end of the same abuse.

I know you didn't really ask that but I thought it was worth pointing out the mentality that exists when it comes to knowing about the game. To answer your question, roles for players are fairly loosely defined because you're either a goalkeeper or an outfielder. Most of the time you're doing the same thing no matter what your position.

We group players into three broad categories, defence, midfield and attack. Generally the players that are better at shooting will play in attack, those better at tackling and positioning are defenders and those who are best at dribbling and passing are midfielder. If they're midfielders that are good at shooting they might be attacking midfielders and if they're good at winning the ball they might be defensive midfielders. If they're good at crossing the ball into the box they might be wingers. Of course you want every player to be able to pass, shoot or tackle to some degree but no one will really care if you can't tackle if you're a striker like Suarez or Van Persie.

In the event of injury, players might be moved into a position that suits their lesser strengths. An attacking midfielder might be pushed up front or a defender who's good on the ball, like Vertonghen or Chiriches, might be pushed into midfield, but it's usually better to keep them in defence and play a weaker midfielder than play a weaker defender and play them out of position.

Judging players is tricky. You can't judge them statistically most of the time because a good pass and a bad pass is subjective. When BAE first joined, many fans didn't rate him but I thought he was excellent, mainly because our previous left-back (young-pyo Lee) was literally afraid to cross whereas Benny was an excellent crosser. I didn't think there was much difference between them defensively. While left backs are nominally defenders, these days they are essentially wingers who also defend. While we might play as a 4-4-2, in the game it's often 2-6-2 since two of the defenders will spend most of their time separated from the two centre backs",0,1392051998,null,0,false,0,cfbs3r6,t3_1xinap,t1_cfbs3r6,t3_1xinap,null,1432335892,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Opinion being the operative word. Comfortable you're usually right, but I'm not that old so comfort isn't high on my list of priorities. Convenient I mostly disagree, I've never had to buy a tax disk or fuel for my bike, I don't need to get it MOT'd. It would be a lot more convenient if the government were willing to spend some of the money I give them in taxes on bike infrastructure rather than just giving it back to motorists.

&gt; No, I said small children i.e. children who cannot cycle.

Ah cool. You can get baby/toddler seats and tailors for them.

That's not really anything to do with convenience is it? That's about expense.

&gt;It would be a lot more convenient if the government were willing to spend some of the money I give them in taxes on bike infrastructure rather than just giving it back to motorists.

Motorists contribute well over £30 billion in fuel and car tax, and less than a third of that is put back onto the roads.

And you agree that everywhere that it has been tried it's worked?

&gt; Not necessarily. Some people just like cars.

Yes. Some people do. Myself included. But it's pretty clear that given the option far more people will cycle than they do now.

&gt; How does the slowness of a bike improve wealth?

How does not spending money on petrol, car payments and insurance not improve wealth?

&gt; Roads for cars provide massively more mobility.

Sometimes. For longer journeys, yes.

I am getting that. I'm not sure why you're not getting that I get that. I'm not saying all people will stop driving. I'm saying far more people will cycle.

Also he slowed down every counter attack that went through him, we counterattacked with more forward range along our flanks , but our final crosses from lennon are still not up to premierleague standard. The major issue with the 4-1-4-1 formation as it was played in the first half was twofold, 1/miscommunication with player assignment (osman was free to shoot , no one from midfield tracked back with purpose) and 2/ because of the deep positioning of the midfield, adebayor had to come back to get any service through the middle of the park, and then have to beat 2-3 everton defenders to be in any position to score.

 [**Harrowing of the north**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrowing%20of%20the%20north): 

---

&gt;

&gt;The **Harrying** (or **Harrowing**) **of the North** was a series of campaigns waged by [William the Conqueror](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Conqueror) in the winter of 1069–1070 to subjugate [northern England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_England).

&gt;In the autumn of 1069 [Sweyn II of Denmark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweyn_II_of_Denmark), had invaded England, in support of the forces of [Edgar the Atheling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_the_Atheling). Edgar was the last remaining member of the House of Wessex with a claim to the throne of England. The Danes with their English allies were able to break the Norman hold on the north. William's response was to systematically devastate the countryside west and north of York, with the intention of isolating his enemies in the city of York. William made peace with the invading Danes and paid them off to return home. With the Danes gone, William continued his 'harrying' through the winter as far north as the river Tees.

&gt;It seems that the main objective of the harrying was to lay waste the northern shires and eliminate the possibility of further revolts. To this end William's army carried out a campaign of general destruction of homes, stock and crops as well as the means of food production. Men, women and children were slaughtered and many thousands are said to have died due to the famine that followed. According to the Domesday Book large areas of Yorkshire and other northern counties were still lying in waste in 1086. Although it is evident that William's army was responsible for a large portion of the death and destruction in the north, some historians have suggested that the damage incurred by William's forces may not have been as extensive as once thought.

true,JimmySevere,eng-berkshire,Berkshire,"This is not what the study says.

1) This study is in regards to persons feeling subjectively poor and not about people who are actually poor. Point being that this study attempts to make those with an income below ~£60,000/year feel poor while most everyone would agree that someone with a personal income above £30,000 is not outright poor. The statistics are easily skewed by the fact that ""the poor"" includes people with a large amount of disposable income who clearly have far smaller risk when buying tickets and coaxes these people into buying tickets by encouraging them to think they are poor.

2) The lottery tickets are ""prepaid"" in a sense as participants are given the money required to purchase the lottery tickets. That is, there isn't the sense of loss that would occur otherwise. (This, I think, is especially relevant when comined with (1)).

3) This study took place in the US where attitudes are quite different - e.g. the American dream.

I probably could go on picking holes but I want to move on to say how their conclusions are false.

&gt;Some poor people see playing the lottery as their best opportunity for improving their financial situations, albeit wrongly so

This is not what the study shows at all. No evidence is given for this claim. Nothing has said that poor people see it as their best opprotunity, just as an opportunity (though even this could be argued as an invalid conclusion by point (1)). Further, nothing has indicated that poor people would be wrong to think this. I shall even argue by analogy that it could even be considered a prudent move:

*A man (A) is stranded in a desert (you can choose the size of the desert) and has run out of water but has a single penny. Another man (B) comes along with a large flask of water. A wishes for some water, you know, to not die, and B says it's a penny per thimbleful. Now, a thimbleful isn't going to last long and A informs as much. So, B proposes a coin toss gamble; if A can guess heads or tails correctly 18 times in a row then B will give the whole flask to A, else B keeps the penny. Despite the fact a penny is the entire sum of A's wealth, it's obvious that the probability of either the penny or a thimbleful of water facilitating his escape from the desert doesn't even come close to the likelihood of winning a coin toss 18 times in a row. Mathematically, A should gamble.*

I tell a lie, the prudent decision is for A to kick the shit out of B for playing such a sadistic game.

&gt;The hope of getting out of poverty encourages people to continue to buy tickets, even though their chances of stumbling upon a life-changing windfall are nearly impossibly slim and buying lottery tickets in fact exacerbates the very poverty that purchasers are hoping to escape.

I refer back to the analogy - impossibly slim &lt;&lt; nearly impossibly slim. Nowt is saying that the small amount of money it costs to buy a lottery ticket will especially be of any use for escaping future poverty if spent otherwise.

*Whinge time*

People I work with seem to have become incapable of recruiting anyone who isn't a muppet to share an office with me these days. Today's newb is the fifth in a year. She:

- Turned up 20 minutes late and didn't say a word about it. Turns out her journey is all of 45 minutes. Later when discussing journeys she implied that not being on time was due to her 'needing to be more organised.' No shit you do. First day. Late. What?

- Asked me if Boss Woman is in today, three seconds after we'd passed and said good morning to her in the hallway. Then stared at me like I'd just crapped in her mouth when I told her such.

- Asked which of the three keys was the one to our office rather than just getting up and trying the fucking lock.

- Had no idea there's another tube strike this week, then later asked me when from and until, rather than just fucking googling it. 

- Asked if we have more meeting rooms whilst looking at the full list of them.

- Asked my permission if she should go and see her own new boss.

And my personal favourite:

- Asked 'is there not a black and white printer, because it's cheaper?.' Apparently she thought colour printers can't print in black and white. 

She has been working in offices for 17 years.

*Sigh.*

Thanks for listening.

true,Sasakura,eu,European Union,"Yes motorcycles go faster but you can both be hit by a car doing 60 and the relative speed is much higher for a cyclists.  Helmets protect from impacts; both cyclists and motorcyclists are vulnerable to them.  The leathers that motorcyclists wear (which are not legally required) are to reduce injury from high speed dismounts so of course that is something a cyclist doesn't have to worry about.

&gt;Also, the health benefits of cycling far outweigh the risks and helmet laws have been shown to reduce the numbers of people cycling.

That's interesting and taken with the relatively low cycle fatalities in the UK I think is a strong argument against mandating helmets.  From the perspective of increasing the nation's health it would seem any restriction on cyclists would be for the worse.

As to why I find it odd; it's that you have licence and safety requirements for everyone who's permitted to use the road network aside from cyclists (and horse riders?).  I'm for improving the safety of cyclists which I think could be done by mandating the use of larger BMX-style helmets, although motorcycle crash studies suggest the chin bar is the most important feature which is only found on race style downhill helmets, would be an improvement in cyclist safety.

I also separately believe that requiring a form of licence would reduce the occurrence of dangerous cycling behaviour (of course we can see that licensed car drivers display dangerous behaviour it's not perfect) which should also increase the safety of cyclists.

Many of the people who have been flooded live in places that haven't flooded in recorded history and the floods usually recede much quicker, causing far less damage.

I'll quote a letter my dad wrote to the Independent, he's not a farmer and wasn't effected by the floods, but he's surrounded by those who were.

&gt; We are a densely populated island. In order to supply our nation with vegetables, fruit, milk and meat, we have learned to farm more difficult landscapes. They may be the harsh uplands of Exmoor, Cumbria or Scotland, the flood-prone East Anglian Fens, or the Somerset Levels.

&gt;The farmers of these regions do not exist in isolation - they rely on their stockmen and women, their tractor and combine drivers, and their fruit and veg' pickers to assist their businesses. These workers typically live locally to the farms, and these small communities may have a local shop, a pub, a garage, a school, and residents who work for these businesses and other support industries. 

&gt;It is no more valid to criticise people for living on the Somerset Levels, where land drainage has become a finely tuned infrastructure over many generations, than it is to criticise people who live in the upland areas, where snow and ice are a frequent hazard, and occasionally in extreme weather extra support is needed from emergency services. When nature tests our defences, and a community is in need, we should all rally round to help.

The surrounding countryside is stunning - get a good coat and some decent boots. There are some very lovely small towns in the area - especially Knighton, Clun and Bishop's Castle.

If you're ready for hard outdoor work there are jobs available in farming and forestry - not very well paid but there is work.  The Hergest Estate employs a few landscape gardeners etc for their formal gardens.

There are quite a lot of tourists through the area - many on foot - and so I'd expect there's seasonal work in hospitality and catering.

It is a long way from other places - I know Americans are used to distance, but a few miles in Britain is a long way, and you can't rely on public transport in rural areas.

Other places: You seem to have a preference for places in beautiful countryside?

York is a small/medium medieval city with a lot of tourists and a large student population, near moorlands and wild beaches and cliffs.

Canterbury is a small place but very lovely. You can certainly get work packing fruit (e.g. for NewmaFruit) at one of the large farms within 6 miles of the city.

Norwich is laid back and friendly - at least it was to me. Get a small boat and look around the Norfolk Broads. Probably best to wait a couple of months for the floods to recede.

The nicest small city/town in Wales *in my opinion* is Caernarfon. In walking distance of some pretty wild and tough mountains (I know, don't laugh, we do have mountains. Not huge compared to Mount McKinley, but some world-class rock climbs and great walks.

Lancaster is near to the Lake District, which is at least worth a google image search. Moving to the Lake District is also possible. There's a lot of seasonal work in pubs/restaurants etc.

Also consider Brighton. It's essentially a place for London to go when it wants a drink. A lot of night life, a world class university and art college, lots of bar and hotel work, lovely hills (the South Downs) and chalk cliffs.

Harmful drinking is very much more prevalent in economically disadvantaged groups.  Your solution is to make them less poor?

&gt;do you think that the reason towns are packed to the brim every weekend is because ""hurr durr people don't know how unhealthy drinking is!!1!1!1!!""

Constructive.  A lot of these people on the weekend aren't the problem; it's the people consistently drinking 5 drinks a day throughout the rest of the week.  This law would have no impact on drinking in establishments, as they are already far above the MUP.

&gt;This law is wishful thinking, good on paper, shitty in actuality.

Why?  I appreciate a couple of arguments, namely individual freedom to drink untaxed (although I think it's a flimsy argument) and the inability of this intervention to target wealthy problem drinkers (which is a problem very hard to target).

If a car hits you at 60 a bike helmet will do sod all. They are rated for collisions under 12mph.

&gt; That's interesting and taken with the relatively low cycle fatalities in the UK I think is a strong argument against mandating helmets. From the perspective of increasing the nation's health it would seem any restriction on cyclists would be for the worse.

Indeed.

&gt; As to why I find it odd; it's that you have licence and safety requirements for everyone who's permitted to use the road network aside from cyclists (and horse riders?).

And pedestrians.

&gt; I'm for improving the safety of cyclists which I think could be done by mandating the use of larger BMX-style helmets, although motorcycle crash studies suggest the chin bar is the most important feature which is only found on race style downhill helmets, would be an improvement in cyclist safety.

As I've said, you'd lose far more than you'd gain. A few less head injuries, way less people cycling. Plus you then need to factor in risk compensation to see if the helmets would actually make the people still riding safer.

&gt; I also separately believe that requiring a form of licence would reduce the occurrence of dangerous cycling behaviour (of course we can see that licensed car drivers display dangerous behaviour it's not perfect) which should also increase the safety of cyclists.

Would be better though if you tweak so Sandro sit's more in the hole, Eriksen comes a little deeper and Paulinho is free to push up a bit. It means Sandro no longer has any offensive responsibility and can focus on utterly dominating the space in front of the back four.

Eriksen can play deeper because the wide forwards will actually support the striker instead. This makes him harder to mark out the game as his movement is less predictable and gives us a far greater quality of distribution from the back. There are questions over whether he's enough of a presence to play deeper but he was 'ok' playing with Holtby in a midfield two so should definitely be fine with Sandro covering and Paulinho next to him.

With Sandro covering Paulinho is freed up to get closer to the striker and that's when we've really looked dangerous this year.  ",0,1392060544,null,0,false,0,cfbwa47,t3_1xjg47,t1_cfbwa47,t3_1xjg47,null,1432337861,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

It really disturbs me though that either you're pro independence or you are expected to shut up. From the big names who've said they've been pressured into saying nothing by the SNP to the common occurrence down the pub of anyone who speaks against independence having their loyalty/scottishness called into question. A lot of pro - indy people really do seem to consider it to be the case that a vote for the union is inherently anti scottish, and I've seen people pretty much denounced as traitors for openly opposing it.

As I'm still on the fence I tend to stay quiet in such discussions, but the tone of the argument is quite upsetting for such a profoundly serious issue.

As to the 'what kind of people'  thing, I kind of agree again. While Im sure that most pro-indy people arent like what ive described above, as a guy from the highlands who finds low landers to be really quite different to people from my area, I do feel like there must be a much higher percentage of the central belt supporting this than the highlands, and I wonder would I really rather be ruled by them than by Westminster?

It's well documented that [Hodgson has frequently played 4-4-2](http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/4961/international-football/2013/06/02/4019817/the-demise-of-4-4-2-hodgsons-reliance-on-the-formation-is) but, as [Michael Cox has commented](http://espnfc.com/blog/_/name/tacticsandanalysis/id/1477?cc=5901), that isn't necessarily a bad thing because it's a *fluid* 4-4-2. Formations aside, though, my point is that Hodgson has to be far more conservative in his tactics with England than Rodgers can be with Liverpool because at the international level managers don't have the time to instill complex tactics such as we saw on Saturday.

&gt; Hodgson isn't some dumb manager, he knows what he's doing.

I agree; he's no mug. But he tends not to use aggressive tactics, which is the point I was making. (Note: At no point did I say Hodgson was a bad manager!)

Add to this, you have a huge coordination problem for the defenders in this situation, about who covers who which is made worse by the way our top three are interchanging positions.

After moving to the US, I dealt primarily with bandwagon fans. Aside from my good friends, who have been supporters of their respective clubs since they were young, most of the people in the US seem to hop on the ""best team wagon"". It was really annoying to see a lot of Barca/Messi statuses on fb during their reign. And it was soon followed by riding ze German Bayern train. 

I had a couple of ass clowns tell me we didn't deserve to win in 2012 because Bayern dominated the match. 

Rivalry with bandwagon fans is not worth it as they are very misinformed and don't care to educate themselves.

Not sure I follow that logic, though fair enough if you don't want to live there - I don't either. Expensive and too cityish for me. 

If you don't want to live in a city, that's fair enough, but it's usually a good idea to live in commuting distance of one, for job reasons, or at least a lot of towns. What's a commutable distance depends on the city - some of our cities are NOT car-friendly, hence my comment about considering what the rail links are like. A lot of places in central Bath don't have any parking at all, and the carparks are extortionate. Other option is a motorbike, as you can usually find somewhere to park one, but tourist season does result in a bunch of idiots wandering across the road without looking :/. 

Haven't worked in Bristol, again, central could be a pain in the ass, but there are quite a few warehouses and office blocks out of the centre that potentially have their own car parks. However, it's a lot cheaper to live in than Bath, so you could choose to live local, but I suspect you'd want to live further out for the green (fields n' trees that is... not money). 

If you're looking for manufacturing type jobs, there are some manufacturing towns/cities in Wales. You'll probably end up looking around the Southern coast - you've got Cardiff and Newport there, apparently Bridgend and Port Talbot have some stuff too. Shouldn't have to live too far out to be living in green areas. Can't comment what it'd be like to work there, though.

As you say it's a fluid 442, Gary Neville pointed out that lots of teams including Bayern and PSG recently have played exactly the same, [link if you wanna see the clip](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1BAF4QSo-gcZGJFZlFCd08zQWM/preview), skip to 29:50.

Moyes supposedly has £200M to spend in the summer...but it won't help either. 

Why? Because he wants to implement his long-ball &amp; crossing a la V Fulham. That kind of football doesn't win the league anymore. 
You hit teams on the counter-attack like us, or you just pass the ball around and dominate the game, like City/Chelsea/Fergie-United. Moyes plays old-school hit &amp; hope. Not quite Stoke-ball, but certainly not beautiful football like the Barcas, City &amp; Liverpools of the world. 

Honestly, they need a basically new squad, not even £200M can fix that (Tottenham tried with £120M ish and it didn't help them improve their position). RVP is getting past it and far too injury prone. Their whole defence needs overhauling, Mata &amp; Januzaj are their only decent players in midfield, and to be honest Januzaj isn't as good as Sterling. 

Without CL, and especially without any european football, very few top players will be attracted to United. Moyes shows no sign of competency, and sure they're a big name, but so are Liverpool. Doesn't mean players would sacrifice playing in the biggest competitions in the world to play for you. 

It won't annihilate them. The money won't be much of an issue because of their gate receipts and how rich the Glaziers are. But the damage to their reputation will hurt. They won't be able to attract the players they want and it will mean it just takes longer for Moyes to rebuild. They may challenge for top 4 next year depending on how wisely Moyes spends this supposed £200M. If he goes and drops £30M+ on more average Everton players (ie; Not Coleman, Barkley or Baines) then they'll struggle even more. 

I reckon while Moyes is in charge they won't win anything. They may get back into top 4, but more likely fighting with Spurs/Everton for 5th/6th. The United board will get frustrated with his poor signings and low-quality football and fire him when they're 15 points off 1st by Christmas 2014.

Notwithstanding that, even if it does have a ""new"" meaning, there's a reason ""gay"" now means ""uncool"" and not a meaning with positive connotations, and that reason is homophobia. The same is true of ""fag"".

This is a good scene that explains the symbolism of language in racial politics, something similiar is also true in sexual politics. While you may not agree with the black nationalist aspects of it, it does show how things like the way we describe people or use words can re-enforce discrimination or perception, in this instance how the word black has almost entirely negative connotations that then affect how we describe or think about black people and even how black people think about themselves. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE84dHl5Nr0

Language is our way of making sense of the universe, and yet it's a curiously undervalued tool in how society functions and how it perpetuates that society. There are elements of society that are homophobic and there are elements of society that are harmed by that homophobia, both active and in the legacy of the words used by even the mildest of remaining homophobia. It's not a major imposition to not use the word ""fag"" or ""gay"" and it's a nice thing to do, so i dont understand the opposition to people saying you probably shouldn't do it. It's just being nice, which I think is the basic minimum standard to expect from anyone, no matter your belief system or moral code.

The problem is that you haven't considered where the 70 or 100 m^(3)/s *goes*. When the ground is already saturated with water after prolonged heavy rainfall, if the water level rises above the natural river bank it isn't actually useful to think of it as the river 'bursting its banks.' When heavy rainfall upstream swells the river which then floods the surrounding area, that's one thing. When the entire water table rises above the river bank, you have a problem that can't actually be solved by dredging rivers.

Given this, all you actually accomplish by dredging the river is make it mildly more efficient at shifting water downstream. The thing to consider is that if you have flooding at point A, then points *downstream* from A will already be experiencing *even worse flooding* if it's raining just a heavily there. Further, unless your river ends with a waterfall pouring into the sea, there's a practical limit to the amount of water you can dump downstream before the whole thing backs up and floods anyway.

Lastly, even if we suppose that downstream from the flooded areas there was just a wilderness and wouldn't mind it flooding (not the case) - it wouldn't actually matter in this case anyway. The amount of water which *continues* to fall on Somerset and the state of the already saturated water table means that this was inevitable.",0,1392066851,null,0,1392067108,0,cfbzd4q,t3_1xjj9f,t1_cfbzd4q,t1_cfbwyot,null,1432339384,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

None of those things are true. The medical team found no evidence of penetration, which does not mean no evidence of police. Per [Vanity Fair](http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2014/02/woody-allen-sex-abuse-10-facts#/livefyre):

&gt; ""The panel consisted of two social workers and a pediatrician, Dr. John Leventhal, who signed off on the report but who never saw Dylan or Mia Farrow. No psychologists or psychiatrists were on the panel. The social workers never testified; the hospital team only presented a sworn deposition by Dr. Leventhal, who did not examine Dylan.
&gt; 
&gt; All the notes from the report were destroyed. Her confidentiality was then violated, and Allen held a news conference on the steps of Yale University to announce the results of the case. The report concluded Dylan had trouble distinguishing fantasy from reality. (For example, she had told them there were “dead heads” in the attic and called sunset “the magic hour.” In fact, Mia kept wigs from her movies on styrofoam blocks in a trunk in the attic.) The doctor subsequently backed down from his contention.
&gt; The Connecticut state police, the state attorney, and Judge Wilk all had serious reservations about the report’s reliability.""


Mia Farrow did not go to the police:
&gt; 
&gt; ""Her lawyer told her on August 5, 1992, to take the seven-year-old Dylan to a pediatrician, who was bound by law to report Dylan’s story of sexual violation to law enforcement and did so on August 6.""

There are a lot of details about this case online, including [most of the text](http://www.scribd.com/doc/205403621/Allen-v-Farrow-Custody-Ruling-June-7-1993) from the conclusion of the Allen/Farrow custody case in which Allen was denied any visitation to Dylan. It's not hard to find, yet people still put forward obvious untruths about the Yale/New Haven investigation (also [online](http://amradaronline.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/yale-new-haven-hospital-allen.pdf), but only two pages) the court case and the custody settlement.

There is also an extended profile of the investigator of the case [here.]

Appropriate I think.

However it's not all the government/EA fault, just mostly.

Personally, I'd consider the farmer who readily increased their subsidies by grubbing out and felling to increase productive area to be, in part, also culpable. It appears to me that whilst the NFU are the first to claim their members are the ""custodians"" of the countryside I've seen quite enough to know that they want to be thought of as conservation champions but actually, that would only be ""convenient"" if the responsibility that comes with it doesn't affect profit / productivity (badgers, neonicotinoid pesticides, flail cutters, clearing hillside of scrub / trees etc) Unfortunately, government and EU policies have encouraged / incentivised some of the most irresponsible and short sighted behaviour.

Whilst ""benefit street"" created an outcry over so called inappropriate use of taxpayers money, it would be an interesting expose that highlighted the level and areas where public money is pumped into farm subsidies!

I don't mean any offence to those currently suffering, but I always laugh at the example that plays out in the football world - a team performs badly, sack the manager without considering the performance of the individual players.

We're like Arsenal, in that we can't get results against the top-of-the-table clubs.

I think we'll end up in the play-offs and unfortunately right now it doesn't look like we have the type of team required to fight our way out of that situation.

BAE &amp; Kranjkar are great. We have lots of individually skilled players, what we don't have is a well-developed team. The Championship is particularly about team ethic. With the exception of Hill &amp; Green our team has been cobbled together during this season and continues to be added to.

When McClaren went, it was just a few games before our defence started losing it's shape. We've slowly let more goals in since then. There is a popular idea that McClaren's coaching was responsible for the great results early on in our season.

Harry is great at attracting relatively big names to our club, but what we are not seeing is the formation of a QPR team.

We are usually predictable. In the first half we wait for the opposition to come to us, we often go a goal down. At half-time Harry gives everyone a bollocking, then we get a goal back for 1 point or we manage to win. That can work against poor teams but won't get you anywhere against an organised group of players.

Also: Don't get any QPR fan started on the ridiculous way we started the season with only one predictably fit striker, after letting 4 strikers leave the club in the summer.

Everyone will tell repeatedly tell you you need a bike. I have been mostly getting the buses but the cost stacks up unless you invest in weekly/monthly tickets, and I haven't found them to be that reliable. Several times I've waited 20/25 minutes for a bus that is meant to be every 10, and on the last time I got one (again, supposedly every 10 minutes) home from work I waited ages and overheard people at the bus stop saying they'd been there 45 minutes, and another saying an hour! I gave in and bought a bike yesterday. None of the shops seemed to have much in the way of second hand/ladies/road bikes and they arent that cheap, so again I went for gumtree.

To be honest I have found Cambridge to be less multicultural than I was expecting, and much less multicultural than the last city I was in, but it's relatively friendly nonetheless. It seems less rough than my last city, but maybe I just haven't seen that side yet. And of course, London is only 55 minutes on the non-stop train.

true,Calavera190,scottish,Fife,"Well, I thank you for providing these, they are illuminating, and have confirmed (in my mind, at least) something which I had suspected, that Mia Farrow was bitter enough and vindictive enough towards Allen that, I feel, meant she would have been capable of coaching Dylan to accuse Allen of abuse. For example, Mia:

Physically abused Soon-Yi on at least one occasion; ""gave Allen a family picture Valentine with skewers through the hearts of the children and a knife through the heart of Ms. Farrow [herself]""; had accused Allen of being a child molester [in reference to his relationship with Soon-Yi]; destroying family photos with Allen and/or Soon-Yi in them.

However, these incidents seem to be motivated not by a prolonged or organised campaign against Allen, but by fits of passion.

That being said, it is clear Allen was far from an ideal parent, in comparison to Mia's attentiveness. *That* being said Allen's unsuitability, I feel, stems from a simple ignorance of good parenting and lack of social skills, rather than a lack of interest to be a good parent. Much is made of Allen's relationship with Soon-Yi, however with the benefit of hindsight we can see that whilst this relationship was possibly deviant, and did not take into consideration the feeling of the other parties it was genuine. They did love each other.

In regards to alleged sexual abuse, my view has changed. Whilst I had thought that both sides had strong arguments to back them up, resulting in stalemate, I now think that both sides have very weak arguments to back them up, resulting, again, in stalemate.

I don't know about that. He started his career as a CAM and when he plays for Nigeria he is an offensive playmaker. That is just not his role at Chelsea. His role is to protect the defense by breaking up the opposing offense and getting the ball to our playmakers. [This article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/nigeria/10571250/World-Cup-2014-John-Obi-Mikel-Nigeria-has-loved-him-hated-him-now-they-love-him-again.html) gives a rough overview of his career from a Nigerian perspective.

Personally, I think it was a sublime move by Jose in his first tenure to move Mikel, an attacking prodigy, back to the defensive midfield. I'm not sure his attacking style would have worked that well in England, but his strength and composure on the ball works well in his position. No he doesn't get the ball forward that much, but he is strong, cool in possession (I love it when he gets the ball and it looks like he is about to get harried and lose possession, but then he calmly does a simple turn that opens up his passing lanes), and makes the smart pass.",0,1392072569,null,0,false,0,cfc25xh,t3_1xibh3,t1_cfc25xh,t1_cfbpmov,null,1432340699,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; Education, training and innovation is the way to salvation for the working poor.

It doesn't really work that way in practice.

There are less jobs than there are people who need employment.  The Thatcherite Conservatives believed that if they cleared out all the ineffective employment new jobs would come.  They didn't know where from.  They didn't consider it their problem to deal with that bit.  *(If you want a source for that, see if you can find a copy of the documentary Tory, Tory, Tory and watch Nigel Lawson explaining that people asked him where the jobs would come from and chuckling as he explained that it wasn't his job to know.)*

Even ignoring that rather important practicality imagine our economic system if everyone of working age was fit, motivated, willing and well educated...  Someone's still gotta man the tills in Asda.  Someone's still gotta deliver the pizzas.  Someone's still gotta clean out the toilets in McDonalds.  Unless you have a benevolent employer *(and those are in short supply these days)* you're generally worth the lowest amount your employer can get away with paying for you.

Poverty will stick to the people at the bottom of the pile.  Education and training can help individuals lift themselves out of poverty, but only by displacing someone else.",0,1392077369,null,0,false,0,cfc4b2q,t3_1xiaho,t1_cfc4b2q,t1_cfbltza,null,1432341776,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I'm behind the purchase of Shaw, I think a lot of people are. But Ross Barkley? I can see why you would *want* to purchase him, but why do we need to?

McEachran (English, Homegrown, 20 y/o)

Baker (English, Homegrown, 18 y/o)

Loftus-Cheek (English, Homegrown, 18 y/o)

Bertrand Traore (Homegrown, 18 y/o)

There's a really good chance Loftus-Cheek will be a part of the first team within the next 24 months. Read his scouting reports and other articles profiling him, watch his play with the youth team and in the previous pre-season against Manchester City. He's better than Barkley.

Willian being 25 is irrelevant. What, do you think his legs are going to fall off when he hits 26? 

If he dips in form due to age the club should incorporate the droves of academy/reserve/loanee talent we have in the midfield and wide areas, specifically the English talent we have. Mourinho's long term strategy seems to be more centered around turning Chelsea into a institution rather than one that buys players whenever there is a gap in the system.

Lampard is in contract until the end of the season, but if this campaign is showing anything it's that the squad is relying on him less; 4 starts and full apps. in the last 10 games. We do have depth in the positions /u/Critzor has mentioned.

true,missmichellini,null,null,"I know I'm late to the thread, but I'm just now rewatching the Martha Jones episodes and remembering how much her character got on my nerves. Personally, I hated her because she not only fell in love with the doctor in literally 2 episodes, she felt *entitled* to love in return. She bitched and moaned that the Doctor had already taken Rose Tyler to New New York when she should have been grateful that the Doctor wanted to take her along through *all of time and space* at all. She frequently pouted and huffed that the Doctor never noticed her, completely ignoring the fact that he is still grieving the woman *he* loved whom he literally can never see again. This seems incredibly selfish to me. 

I will say this: Martha Jones was smart. Practical. Strong. But these things do not entitle her to love. This is classic friend-zone thinking - ""I have x, y, and z traits and I have done x, y, and z for you. Therefore I deserve your love."" That's not how love works. The Doctor was still deeply in love with Rose - whom he had *years* of history with and still never told he loved her - and Martha just waltzed in expecting him to shower her with adoration and affection he couldn't give. This was extremely annoying and actually took away from a lot of character development that could have happened, I think. Donna and Rose both saved the Doctor just as much as Martha did and they never asked or pushed for anything in return. Martha was selfish.

 [**Y Gododdin**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%20Gododdin): 

---

&gt;

&gt;**Y Gododdin** (pronounced [ə ɡɔˈdɔðɪn]) is a medieval [Welsh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language) poem consisting of a series of [elegies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elegy) to the men of the [Brittonic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britons_(Celtic_people\)) kingdom of [Gododdin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gododdin) and its allies who, according to the conventional interpretation, died fighting the [Angles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angles) of [Deira](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deira) and [Bernicia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernicia) at a place named Catraeth in c. AD 600. It is traditionally ascribed to the bard [Aneirin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneirin) and survives only in one manuscript, the [Book of Aneirin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Aneirin).

&gt;The Book of Aneirin manuscript is from the later 13th century, but Y Gododdin has been dated to anywhere between the 7th and the early 11th centuries. The text is partly written in [Middle Welsh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Welsh) orthography and partly in [Old Welsh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Welsh). The early date would place its oral composition soon after the battle, presumably in the Hen Ogledd (""Old North""); as such it would have been written in the [Cumbric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumbric) dialect of [Common Brittonic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Brittonic). Others consider it the work of a poet from Wales in the 9th, 10th or 11th century. Even a 9th-century date would make it one of the oldest surviving Welsh works of poetry.

&gt;The Gododdin, known in [Roman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Britain) times as the [Votadini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Votadini), held territories in what is now southeast Scotland and [Northumberland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northumberland), part of the Hen Ogledd (Old North). The poem tells how a force of 300 (or 363) picked warriors were assembled, some from as far afield as [Pictland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picts) and [Gwynedd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Gwynedd). After a year of feasting at Din Eidyn, now [Edinburgh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh), they attacked Catraeth, which is usually identified with [Catterick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catterick,_North_Yorkshire), [North Yorkshire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Yorkshire). After several days of fighting against overwhelming odds, nearly all the warriors are killed. The poem is similar in ethos to [heroic poetry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry), with the emphasis on the heroes fighting primarily for glory, but is not a narrative. The manuscript contains several stanzas which have no connection with the Gododdin and are considered to be interpolations. One stanza in particular has received attention because it mentions [King Arthur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur), which, if not an interpolation, would be the earliest known reference to that character, as outside this poem, Welsh Arthurian legend is known to develop only from c. the early 12th century.

Lukaku: If we don't buy, he will play for Chelsea. If we buy, it all depends on the rest of this season and the pre-season. Could be loaned again, but I feel he might be a bit frustrated at that possibility. He is injured right now. I don't think we will buy Cavani (or Falcao, or Diego Costa, etc.)

Courtois: Unlikely we will sell. We do not hurt for money. He is 21 and already a top 5 keeper in the world. If he goes, we would receive at least 20 million pounds. At 12-15, we might as well just shoot ourselves in the foot. Not to mention, if we sell Courtois, we will have to buy a replacement as good as Cech is and that will not be cheap. Other clubs will charge Chelsea high, and rightly so, we have deep pockets. It will definitely be more than the sum we will have sold Courtois. He must at least split games with Pete

Piazon is harder to judge. He will be behind many great players, but I doubt he will play where Oscar does - he is a winger, and probably will be more suited to it. Probably will be loaned again. Likely will not be sold.

UEFA had an article a while ago which has since been taken offline or something which explained it really well.

My understanding of FFP is as such, and someone is more than welcome to correct me if I'm wrong.

Club funds outgoing through transfers, employee benefits, and employee wages are **counted over** income from ticket sales, TV revenue, advertising, merchandise, player sales, and prize money.

Outgoing Funds/Incoming Funds

FFP rules state clubs must keep losses to an aggregate of €45m (£37.2m) across the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seasons ([Herbert &amp; Scott-Elliot, 2014](http://ind.pn/1bkCYXH)).

The rules say that if you exceed the aggregate losses that UEFA establishes, they can punish you through the sanctions they've established.

For Example:

Across the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seasons Football Club X Spends €150m through transfers, employee benefits, and employee wages, but only generates €100m in income. They're €50m in the red and could be subject to punishment by UEFA.

This is ~~probably~~ over simplification (as it does not take into account certain wage exclusions and permitted exclusions UEFA has established) but the nuts and bolts of FFP seems to be that UEFA wants to rein in clubs that could effectively afford to operate at a loss year after year given their ownership situation. 

Clubs are given a maximum permitted loss that they can operate under. There are acceptable thresholds of loss which clubs can operate under without penalization, but going over the threshold means the club would fail the FFP Break Even test and be subject to FFP sanctions. These include warnings, reprimands, fines, point deductions, prohibition of registering new players in UEFA competition, etc...  

It's worth pointing out that UEFA's FFP rules only apply to clubs who wish to compete in the Champions League or the Europa League. Clubs have to apply to UEFA to take part and will only get a license if they meet the FFP rules.

true,Thapricorn,lfc-08-09-grey-kit,null,"I agree that Moyes is going to get better, but I think you're being way too paranoid here. Sure, he dominated the league for decades, but Ferguson is not infallible. Not at all. It doesn't matter how domineering or bullying his style of play was, it doesn't mean he's some sort of God who knows how to pick a Messiah. Here's why: 

Moyes picks up from that bullying, physical powerhouse ideal behind Scottish temper. This turns the game into a physical battle between two sides, where usually, the mentally tougher side will always fight it out. Ferguson picked him because he most emulated the style of play United had in his reign. He is, and was, hoping that he will continue with this. And that looks like the path United is heading towards: Trying to rebuild the domineering side they had the past 20 years.

Rodgers picks up from something totally different. The Spanish style. Tiki taka, pass and move, total football, whatever you call it. It's been under development for the last 20+ years, and Pep Guardiola's Barcelona *perfected* it. It has only been 5 years since it was fully unveiled but this style of play is starting to slowly, but surely take over the league. Look at the league leaders minus Chelsea (who counter on fast breaks): Liverpool, Arsenal, City. They all play a fluid, dynamic style of football that focuses on pinpoint passes and strong off-ball runs. Besides teams like Bayern or Madrid, there are close to zero clubs that have even come close to beating this. 

Do you remember what happened the last time these two styles of play met? Ferguson got thoroughly, and handily beaten by a Barcelona side who controlled the tempo of the game, pressed high up, and did not allow United to get any sort of rhythm. Twice. This is the side that Rodgers is basing his play off of. 

In the long haul, I believe that Rodgers' style of football is more modern, more proactive, and more suited to the future of football, than the tactics of Moyes. You seem to have Ferguson on some sort of pedestal, which is understandable considering his success, but you need to also realize that in modern years, the game has been changing to where I am fully confident that a United squad even under SAF would be struggling against how teams of today play. You saw how he struggled in Europe these past 5 years, which I expect to be echoed by Moyes in the future, unless he changes something drastically.

But if you're english-speaking anyhow the cultural gap isn't as significant. Leicester is pretty nice and well-placed within the UK with Birmingham and the rest of the midlands nearby, and London not all that far off. 

Leicester's most notable for being the first city in the UK to have a 'white minority', that is to say that less than 50% of the population are white. It has a large Indian and Pakistani community - which on the one hand means you can get some of the best Indian food in the UK from its ""curry mile"", but on the other means there is still some problems between the communities in Leicester.

If you look at both Spurs and Arsenal starting* teams there is really only a handful of players who truly understand exactly who they are playing. For example do you really think Özil or say Paulinho or Eriksen is all out for blood and glory when they play Arsenal/vice-versa. Yes I'm sure they want to win but there isn't the drive and heart like in more experienced premier league players such as Ramsey or Walcott with his banter or I guess maybe a spurs fan favorite who displays a lot of heart is Sandro or Michael Dawson (correct me if I'm wrong). But so yeah I think this is definitely an issue and one both fan groups I'm guessing aren't  fans of. I can honestly say the most exciting spurs games were the ones with Harry Redknapp at the helm.

Source: my dad was Brit, and not just any type: full-on Cockney.

""Cockney"" means basically ""poor white trash from a bad part of London"".  It's a bit more complex than that but it's a starting point.

See, where America has racial issues, Britain has class issues.  Who has money and who doesn't (preferably via inheritance) matters.

If you're from a lower-class area, and that's identified more or less entirely by accent, then the only thing you're going to be doing on TV is comedy of some sort, and you're probably the joke.

In the US we did a little bit of that in terms of Southern accents but not near as deep, nasty or pervasive as happened on British TVs.  We often had characters on American TV that had Southern accents but were otherwise likable and intelligent - ""Matlock"" comes to mind, many others.  There is no Cockney equivalent to ""Matlock"" in British TV.

Now, the exact reasons why northern farmland accents in Britain came to be associated with lower incomes probably has a lot to do with what Wosmo is talking about above.  But he left out the fact that Cockneys (who as Londoners are SouthEastern) are treated worse than holders of the northern farm country accents.

In my dad's case, he came to California to get away from the London pub scene that turned his dad into a drunk.  Once he came to the US he laughed his ass off when everybody thought he had a ""cultured British accent""...without realizing it would happen he had escaped the massive limitation in British society that his accent had burdened him with.",0,1392086688,null,0,false,0,cfc8g7s,t3_1xcwgp,t1_cfc8g7s,t1_cfaitq4,null,1432343728,-10,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,-10

Major differences:

- Undergraduate degrees take 4 years, Masters take at least 2

- US degrees (at least at Columbia) take a ""liberal arts"" approach, and you are required to take courses from a range of subjects, not just your major. 

- You are generally not required to declare your major until your sophomore year, giving you time to figure out what you want to earn your degree in. 

- Tuition is *extortionate* - Columbia University tuition (including average cost of room and board) is $65,000 (about £39,500). Keep in mind though that many scholarships are available. 

- The legal drinking age is 21 in the states, so on-campus pubs aren't really a thing, but party culture and drinking happen just about the same in the states as they do here, I've found... 

Otherwise socially, going to uni (college) in America is very similar to going to university here in the UK. Columbia in particular is a campus school with beautiful architecture, and a pretty large population of international students. Because of it's reputation and cost, there are a lot of rich kids there, and courses are generally very demanding (in the states the school, like other ivy league schools, has a reputation for being pretentious). The quality of education is compared to Oxford and Cambridge, but it's in NYC, so you have access to literally everything a big city has...
