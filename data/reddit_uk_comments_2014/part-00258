I placed an order for a couple of bags of Jolly Ranchers and noticed a small error in the checkout for the site, no probs, new site and all that.
I emailed them, got a reply with a big thank you and placed my order. This was at 10pm.
About ½ hour later I hear a nock nock at the door and upon opening it I find a guy holding my order plus a couple of other goodies as a thank you.

I was a bit flustered and forgot to get his name but I must say that's rather impressive service.

The fact that it is followed up by his awkward hug with Clara makes it even better.

true,TheAndies,null,null,"Well it would be more accurate IMO to say that two officers is more *typical* for an arrest, based on a compliant detainee and no outside factors such as public order, additional suspects &amp; so on. It's also the minimum required for prisoner transport - one to drive, the other to supervise the prisoner. It doesn't take much to bump that number up at all. 


It's not the same scenario as yours, but a few years ago I had a bystander demand to know why so many officers were in her street, when only one ""poor boy"" was in handcuffs. My answer was basically:

- three officers to supervise the prisoner, because he has been violent and assaulted at least two people this evening. 

- two officers to search the route he took, because he threatened someone with a knife and is believed to have discarded it close by. When done they will go door-to-door to try to find more witnesses. 

- one officer to sit with the victim around the corner, getting their first account. 

- one officer to take statements from the three known witnesses. 

- two officers to deal with the prisoner's father, who lived nearby and had heard his son was being arrested again, so had decided to give the police a piece of his mind. 

- one inspector to supervise/moan about the overtime he was having to authorise. 

- one sergeant to try to placate the inspector. 


Obviously the last two weren't necessary at the scene, but that's still 9 officers for one arrest. It could be done *safely* with about 5 (3 with the prisoner, 2 for the father), but that still leaves some vital jobs undone. And all that with still only one suspect.

It looks like your apprenticeship will cover your monthly outgoings and then some, which is great. Probably the best thing to do with your lump sum is to put it into a savings account or ISA that enables instant access. 

This means it won't be burning a hole in your current account, you'll have to make a conscious effort to get at the money, but at the same time you won't have to wait long periods to get to it if you needed it, like you would in some more complex investment accounts. It's not a fun or sexy answer, but it's probably the most sensible (which is what we're here for!). 

If you need to spend some of it, then decide how much you're happy to blow on fun things in advance, take that amount out of the savings account and into your current account and stick to it. 

Cars are money-sinks. You have to pay for the car itself, which is a big lump sum but hey, it's only once right? And you lose about half that money as soon as you've bought it and added another owner onto it's history. But then you commit to buying road tax, insurance and breakdown cover every year, as well as having an MOT done every year (and fixing whatever is wrong with it so it will pass). Tack on petrol, parking, congestion charge if you're in the London area, non-MOT repair work, etc.

If you need a car, you need a car and there's nothing to be done. If you think you could hold out a while, your insurance will drop exponentially the longer you leave it between passing your test and getting your first car (ridiculously) and your wallet will thank you.

true,LocutusOfBorges,,Liberal Democrat  | /r/LibDem,"PE lessons are part of the problem, obesity-wise.

Overweight kids have a *horrible* time in the things, and end up associating exercise with being screamed at by sociopaths-in-teachers'-clothing, bullied to hell and back by classmates, and generally feeling terrible about themselves. As a result, they're substantially more likely to view the whole ""getting active"" thing negatively. 

Offer kids access to a school gym with exercise machines, and *fund the provision of those facilities*. Offer the option of simply going there to kids in lieu of their thrice-weekly hour of pointless kicking about of a ball. 

I looked forwards to the exercise back in the day, but I saw overweight kids having absolutely miserable times of it. Result? They're, by and large, still overweight- and look back on those times with disgust. 

Of course, that takes huge amounts of funding- and space for the facilities in question. Doubt it'd be feasible. But it'd be superb if it were possible.

If improving the health of students is the reason we throw kids out into fields/racquet courts several times a week, then why are sports necessarily part of that? I can't imagine how many kids would be in better shape now if they were given nutrition lessons and gym time instead of being forced onto a muddy Rugby pitch with people they hate.

&gt;The new __first series__ of [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_television) [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) programme ___[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)___ began on 26 March 2005 with the episode ""[Rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_(Doctor_Who\))"", which marked the end of the programme's 16-year absence from episodic television following its cancellation in 1989, and the first new televised *Doctor Who* story since the broadcast of [the TV movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(film\)) starring [Paul McGann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McGann) in 1996. The finale episode, ""[The Parting of the Ways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Parting_of_the_Ways)"", was broadcast on 18 June 2005. The show was revived by longtime *Doctor Who* fan [Russell T Davies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_T_Davies), who had been lobbying the [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) since the late 90s to bring the show back. The first series comprised 13 episodes, eight of which Davies wrote. Davies, [Julie Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Gardner) and [Mal Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal_Young) served as executive producers, [Phil Collinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Collinson) as producer.

Nu-Who episodes seem to portray the ""controls"" as being symbolic rather than literal, their effectiveness is dependent on conditions that are not logical from a purely physical point of view.  Like when Amy has to take a step to the right and repeat the same motion to perform a task.  And the doors in interior passageways can be unlocked with a series of thoughts rather than by physical means. 
I think this Doctor is so different from the others, he doesn't need the ""gimmicks"" of spaceflight to control the TARDIS.  He simply focuses and the TARDIS knows his intent.  I do not mean to imply this makes him superior in skill, just his particular psyche is different from previous versions.

I just loved the way he moved, his energy was undying and beautiful, and he was so incredibly human in a way. That made Smith's Doctor a very relatable one for me, especially with how emotional the show began to get.

Now, after seeing Capaldi, I am stunned. The man is INCREDIBLE in the way he handles the role. I had my doubts at having an older man follow up three fairly young men in the role, I didn't really know how well it would carry over. But Capaldi has blown me away with his outstanding manner. Everything he does is so suave and cool, exactly as the Doctor should be. No more running about throwing levers and holding on for dear life. He is all about cool.

Also, he's growing so dark now. We finally get to see a side of the Doctor that has only been hinted at and tossed around. The man is dangerous, and we finally get to see that.

Also, I'd like to say that as true fans of the series, one has an obligation of sorts to respect and cherish every incarnation of the Doctor. After all, that's what the show is about- embracing the changes! Sure, he's got a few more wrinkles now, but he's the Doctor! And no matter what face he may wear, he's still the same wonderful Timelord that we've all given both our hearts to.

I hate to sound like I am complaining after eventually benefiting from the marking system although it has inconvenienced me a large amount. Obviously a small margin of interpretation is acceptable when marking subjective exams but not 1/5 marks in a 120 mark paper. 

However the whole experience did, for me at least, raise the issue that one paper was viewed with a disparity of 20% between two different examiners. This is not necessarily either of their faults and is perhaps more the fault of the exam board for not providing a more rigid approach to marking, in some cases, according to my teacher at least, you may not be marked by somebody who has even read your texts... 

It is a problem that should be addressed now so it doesn't happen again to such a degree (and probably already should have been addressed).

I don't know if you are familiar with the marking methods of OCR. These are the necessary attributes for a top band answer:

&gt;-well developed and consistently detailed discussion of effects of language, imagery and verse form

&gt;-excellent and consistently effective use of analytical methods

&gt;-consistently effective use of quotations and references to text, critically addressed, blended into discussion 

&gt;-consistently developed and consistently detailed understanding of the significance and influence of contexts in which literary texts are written and understood, as appropriate to the question 

&gt;-excellent and consistently detailed understanding of poem and question
 
&gt;-consistently fluent and accurate writing in appropriate register

&gt;-critical terminology used accurately and consistently

&gt;-well structured, coherent and detailed argument consistently developed 

To do all of that you can achieve 26 out of 30 marks at the examiners discretion. Now lets compare it to something 20% (6 marks) below that:

&gt;-generally developed discussion of effects of language, imagery and verse form

&gt;-competent use of analytical methods

&gt;-competent use of illustrative quotations and references to support discussion

&gt;-competent understanding of the significance and influence of contexts in which literary texts are written and understood, as appropriate to the question 

&gt;-competent understanding of poem and question 

&gt;-clear writing in generally appropriate register 

&gt;-critical terminology used appropriately 

&gt;-straightforward arguments competently structured 

The difference between those two descriptions is rather obvious to me yet that difference is allowed to be interpreted by two different examiners, often unregulated. 

Our coursework is marked by our teachers and then externally moderated. If the moderator does not agree with the marking then the entire set is marked up/down accordingly. Guess what? 99.9% of the time nobody is ever marked up/down because the teacher and the moderator agree on the marks. 

In this instance two individuals manage to agree on the mark of a subjective essay. Maybe a similar system should be applied to the actual exam?

I think this gives us strength and control in the middle with Jan, Fazio, Capoue &amp; Dembélé. 

It also gives us incredible speed down the flanks. 

Walker, Rose, Lamela and Chadli running at defenders would give them nightmares. 

Eriksen would add the creative touch and help facilitate movement. 

Soldado would have less pressure on him when I there's are rushing forward. He could wait for the Eriksen pass, a cross from the side or a lose ball off a shot. That's his speciality. He knows where to be when the ball is in the final third. 

Adebayor is great but we can't have everyone be used to him and have him leave for the African Cup. We need to start working Soldado into the lineup now.

The pressing and energy that Lallana/Hendo/Allen in the same team gives is fantastic, but you lose Balotelli as a striker, and Sturridge seems to play better with a secondry striker...

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"It's not possible for Salmond to do it any other way though.

Salmond always had to come to this with a vision, if he didn't he'd have been crucified, who the hell says we should go independent but doesn't have idea what that might look like? So he lays out what he's going to go after. Obviously he lays out the best possible outcome, like all politicians he's not going to concede defeat on any point before he's even started.

The NO campaign won't pre-negotiate though, they never gave any inclination what so ever if some ideas were more possible than others. As is their right of course (and was good political strategy, just keep it light, remind people of the olympics, beer and tunnels or something then let the status quo remain). For a long time it was working, about 6 months or so ago Salmond did seem to just be touring around having one side of a conversation.

*Then* the no currency union statement came, they finally spoke back. It was assumed outside of Scotland that this would be some giant hammer blow, it would be Osbourne coming up and just destroying all the talking Salmond had been doing up until then.

It wasn't *really* taken that way though, instead people seen it as NO getting scared. Why break the silence? Why this issue? Why now? See the SNP hadn't actually spent the previous year and half *buttering people up* for some land of milk &amp; honey as the media claims. The town hall meetings, the speeches, the TV interviews were all about how there are challenges, how splitting will be a long complex process. Everyone knew there's every chance we'll have to give some stuff up to get other stuff, everyone knew it would be a *negotiation*. 

Meaning everyone who'd been interested in YES before then just kind of went *""Oh, well we think we can come up with an offer they like""* and just carried on as normal. It's not *dictator Salmond* or *braveheart nationalists* it's simply everyone already knowing spanners would be thrown into the works but we'll press on anyway and try our best.

So YES went after the perceived weakness, they spent more time talking about where the union fails us and how the NO side wasn't interested in *improving* anything they were just sending up suits with instructions to stamp out the discussion. 

If NO weren't rattled before the no currency union speech, they certainly were after it and after YES switched on them. This is when the negative campaigning really began in earnest, this is when we started being told the oil was running out, we wouldn't get into the EU, we couldn't afford the NHS, we won't have a military etc etc etc. Not to mention the extremely patronising ads aimed a women. 

Now here we are with a few weeks to go, with something like a 15 point swing towards YES in the polls. If you set aside you may or may not believe about how the issues will go you can't deny that as a purely people-convincing political exercise the NO campaign has done quite spectacularly badly.

It cannot possibly be cheaper to provide meals and staff to cook them for every child than it is to pay for someone to sit in an office and filter those who need them.

&gt;It removes the impact of poor students having to show a ""poor person card"" to get their free meal

Easily solved with a sensible smart card system.

&gt;It allows them to get greater discounts on bulk buys and have a more accurate knowledge of what their budgets will be and how much food they will need.

Whoa there. You think buying school meals for 100% children will provide bulk buy discounts making the cost less than providing for 20% children? This is bonkers.

Why would they have greater knowledge of what their budgets are? They're going to know one way or another who they are providing for and how much they can use.

&gt;If wealthy children are eating free meals too then wealthy parents will campaign for higher quality meals benefiting everyone.

I look forward to seeing that. A marginal benefit at best. If you actually want to improve quality, just use some of this magic new budget to improve meals for the children who actually need them.

&gt;Despite all that is it so bad if some wealthy children get a free meal?

It's not a question of 'so bad' it's a question of cost v benefit. There's a huge cost here but no identifiable benefit.

Nope. Sorry. You've been duped. They did not die in the plane, it was not a dream. And not in a Sopranos it's-up-to-your-own-interpretation way. It was clearly established as having happened ""for real"" (in the tv sense of course), and confirmed multiple times by Lindelof and Cuse afterward. I can't get much more specific than that without going into spoiler territory but the final episode quite clearly states that everything that happened in the series was the characters surviving a plane crash, and it's not up for debate. But a handful of idiots who didn't pay attention have made a lot of noise and non-watchers were manipulated as a result.

I clarify because I care, and Lost was one of the paradigm-shifting experience of my life, and that's not hyperbole. So anytime I see a conversation heading in this direction I nip it in the bud.

You can start at the beginning, but that can be... rough. There's some great stuff there, but at times it can be slow and feel dated. It might be best to wait until you get into the show and want to explore the history of it. It's worth watching, but the barrier to get into it is higher than the more recent episodes.

The show was rebooted in 2005, so it was pretty much created with the explicit point of drawing in *new* viewers after a long hiatus.

If you aren't feeling it, skip ahead to season 2. Each Doctor is a bit different, and the next one might be more your style.

If you still aren't feeling it, try season 5. They had a new Doctor *and* a new showrunner, and with all that changed in the show, it was kind of a soft reboot. (Note, when I'm saying ""reboot"" I don't mean the whole continuity is restarted, so much as a shift in the show.) Honestly, I might even recommend starting here, but I'm a bit biased, since I got on board with the show via the 11th Doctor and like those seasons better. :p

I'm tempted to say the 50th anniversary special is a great introduction, as it's big and sweeping and moving, and it also pays homage to the history of the show... but it can be hard to follow if you go into it as a new viewer, and some of the story elements won't have quite the same impact.

*Reporter 1*: Diego it was said that you had a minor muscle injury has that healed completely?

**Diego**: It feels great I played all 90 minutes so that should tell you something about it.

*Reporter 2*: You seem to be adapting well to the Premier League, where you expecting for that to be the case?

**Diego**: Well yeah it's a fast paced and physical league but I'm doing great but we've only played 3 games so we will see if I have really adapted to it as the season progresses.

*Reporter 3*: How is Mourinho?

**Diego**: What do you mean?

*Reporter 3*: how is he individually?

**Diego**: He is a great manager me and him get along great shows you the type of person he is.

*Reporter 4*: Diego, how are you coming into this friendly are you happy to be back?

**Diego**: Of course I am happy it seems like I have a debt with the team I wan't to play great and score many goals and I think I owe that to the fans.

*Reporter 5*: Diego, are you ready to be the leading scorer for this Spain's national team. We see that Torres is not here, Villa retired and Negredo picked up a knock how do you feel about that any pressure?

**Diego**: No pressure you tend not to think about things like that so they won't get to your head all you need to do is play to your strengths and if you do that work hard you can achieve many things to give me this opportunity is great and I will do the best that I can.

*Reporter 6*: How did the team react and you especially about the teams performance during the World Cup:

**Diego**: I'm going to be honest and say that we and I especially did not expect us to be eliminated so early in the tournament. I believe that the team we had was special and could have been better or reached further. 

*Reporter 7*: What was the reaction like:

**Diego**: Shocked more really but it's football and in football there are no scripts anything can happen and unfortunetly for us it did not go as planned and we did not have a great tournament but what we can do now is pick ourselves up and be better than ever that's what great teams do.

The thing about Lost is that the experience of watching it in real-time and the experience of watching on Netflix or DVD can completely alter how you view it. When we watched week-to-week and season-to-season we had all this downtime to compares notes on the internet, look for clues in each episode, and plot our theories out. Some were so elaborate and complicated that it became painfully obvious there was no way it could be deconstructed on a tv show. And so people went into the endgame with absurdly high expectations that they expected to be met, and I'm guilty of that too. But it could never happen, and when those expectations weren't met there was blowback. 

On the other hand, I've heard from many people who binged it once the show was over and there has been a lot more positivity, considering they didn't often form theories or focus in on one intriguing aspect. They just played the next episode and took the journey. There's still little pieces to the puzzle not explicitly stated but can be put together if you have a good memory, pieces that enhance the mythology but are not directly relevant to the main characters of the show. And it's a character show first and foremost, and your stance on the characters alters how you view the finale.

With the HMO, that probably meets the old regulations, I doubt it meets new regulations though (I think you're supposed to have an alarm in every room now but im not 100% on that).
However, if there's less than 3 people living there a HMO certificate isn't required.

You should do this with every house you rent anyway, but spend a few hours taking photos and making notes on the current condition of the property in case the landlord gets fussy about it.

Yes the landlord may have charged for the missing freezer drawers and marker pen etc... on the other hand for all you know the last tennants could have skipped on 3 months rent. However even if he did charge for the damage he's not really under any obligation to fix it, as long as it's functional.

Don't worry about the meter men - they have tourches (how else are they going to work in a basement if for whatever reason they have to turn all the power off?).

Worst case scenario, you have an extremely lazy landlord that isn't interested in spending any time or money on a property that has a good probability of being wrecked by students (I'm not implying you are, just maybe that your landlords had bad experiences in the past), in which case you're likely to run into a lot of resistance in getting anything fixed that he isn't legally obliged to resolve. For this case, if anything breaks at least report it to them and keep a your own record of it to cover yourself.

A few friends of mine have neglected to even watch this season due to Capaldi being The Doctor, but being open to new things and loving The Thick of It, I was excited to see him. After finishing the first episode Capaldi reminded me of Hugh Laurie as House (whom I actually thought/hoped would be The Doctor when it was revealed).

This same thing is even more reminiscent of Greg House as a character, who would often do things that would be morally unjust and often harmful to his patients just to prove his own theories about them. In the same way, The Doctor wanted so badly to fix the Dalek to prove his own belief that Daleks can never truly be good people, Clara even picks up on this and gives him a well-deserved slap. 

I think in the back of his mind The Doctor wanted to Rusty to still be a 'good Dalek' once the crack had been patched up, because that would be the most logically beneficial for him, but his egomania made the proving of his own theory more lucrative.

In addition, I think that maybe initially The Doctor was pleased to hear Rusty say ""Daleks must be exterminated."" at the beginning of the episode because it coincided with his own hatred of Daleks, and perhaps for a moment he saw Rusty as an ally or a weapon to be used against Daleks, but this very thought later disgusted him when he reintroduced hatred into the Dalek.",0,1409714360,null,0,false,0,ck7phzu,t3_2f113q,t1_ck7phzu,t1_ck5djwk,null,1427225800,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

&gt;

&gt;""__The Bells of Saint John__"" is the sixth episode of the [seventh series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_7\)) of the British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_television) programme *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*. It premiered in the United Kingdom on 30 March 2013 on [BBC One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One); the episode was the first of the second half of the series. It was written by [Steven Moffat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Moffat) and directed by [Colm McCarthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colm_McCarthy_(director\)).

&gt;In the episode, alien time traveller [the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleventh_Doctor) ([Matt Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Smith_(actor\))) is looking for [Clara Oswald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Oswald) ([Jenna-Louise Coleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna-Louise_Coleman)), a woman whom he has met by chance on two previous occasions only for her to die both times. He manages to find a third version of her in the present-day London, where Miss Kizlet ([Celia Imrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celia_Imrie)) is helping the [Great Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Intelligence) use the world's [Wi-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi) to upload people to a datacloud via robots known as Servers, casually referred to as Spoonheads.

&gt;""The Bells of Saint John"" was designed to be an ""urban thriller"", in that it is taking ""something omnipresent in your life and making it sinister"". It was watched by 8.44 million viewers in the UK. The episode received generally positive reviews, although several critics felt that the plot and threat were lacking.

He disappointed a lot of people because just like last season people hyped him to potential POTY and put him and Sterling in the same level.

We have a number of football pubs in the city, but the two best ones are The Globe and Fado. As others have mentioned, The Globe is in Lakeview, and if you're coming from Old Town, it is only a short ride north on the Brown Line. It is about a block west of the Irving Park Brown Line stop, located on the north side of Irving Park. There are a number of Hammers that watch matches there, and your best opportunity to watch with fellow Hammers. I can send out a quick message to some friends to see who will be watching there that day.

Your other option is Fado Irish Pub, located in River North. Coming from Old Town, it is an even shorter Brown Line trip south to Merchandise Mart, and only about 2 blocks from the stop. There is the occasional WH fan that watches there, though they are fairly quiet about it. Fado will be quieter as well, but the overall quality of the fans are better.

Comparing the two, you'll have a better chance of meeting more Hammers at The Globe. Fado will be closer by about 10 minutes, Fado has better food and Guinness, though it is more expensive. The Globe's environment is more of a pub where American soccer fans go to watch their BPL club, while Fado is where ex-pats (with some Americans) go to watch some football, whether it is their club or just another match. Having been to both over the years, I prefer the environment of Fado, even though I'm far more likely to watch a match with more WH fans at The Globe.

I don't think the doctor pushed off the machine guy. He only influenced it. But all in all it was his choice. Like the soldier girl, it was her choice to die. They both decided to die for the greater good. Like saying whatever the Doctor did is only secondary to their choice to die. They chose to die for the people not the Doctor but he was greatly affected by their cause. That idea makes it to the Doctor's mind to save them subconsciously to his little pocket universe that exists either in one of the many rooms of the TARDIS that has a different Desktop or the pocket Universe.

Try qualifying for mobility benefit under the new 'improved' system.

I can walk 30 meters, maximum.  I won't qualify for the upper rate when the new rules are applied to me.  I will lose my mobility car and be housebound.  I've had 4 heart attacks, so I have rampant heart disease along with a myriad of other issues.  I was declared fit for work and had to go to tribunal (which took a year of having no money, and being housebound - they declared in my favour in less than 5 minutes)

My ""spare"" bedroom, is used to store my oxygen tanks and mobility scooter.  Even though there is nowhere else to store them, it was deemed as not applicable for the bedroom tax to be waived under the disability rules.

My best friend has two prosthetic legs.  Due to her joints being fucked, she can't use them outside and must use a wheelchair.  She doesn't qualify for the upper rate and will also lose her wheelchair adapted car when the new rules are applied to her.

The same person was turned down for care allowance because she needs help at night.  At the tribunal the DSS representative suggested she should not drink any fluids after 4pm and then she wouldn't need help for bathroom.

A family friend has only 1 arm, metal rods in his spine, legally blind (he was in a car crash hit by drunk driver).  He was declared fit for work.

Under the old rules, if you could only walk up to 200m you would qualify for upper rate mobility.  The govt consulted over 300 charities their opinion - only FIVE agreed that the distance should be shortened.  Guess which decision they went with? (hint, it wasn't the other 295+ charities that disagreed)

--------------Guzan

Hutton- --Vlaar --Senderos -Cissokho

------Cleverley----Westwood

--------------Delph

Agbonlahor------------Weimann

I personally don't think Delph has enough quality to play in an advanced role (and I don't think he's positionally disciplined enough either) but Westwood having someone else (anyone else) to look up to, pass the ball and know it isn't going to be lost, would be a huge improvement. Cleverley is nowhere near as incisive as Westwood but at least he is tidy on the ball. 

He and Westwood could control the tempo whilst Delph runs every blade of grass (as usual!) chasing lost causes.

I'd imagine if/when we need more steel in MF (like running down a game) then Sanchez could be brought on to replace Cleverley.

Actually, the more I think about it, and from what I know of Lambert, I can't help but get the uneasy feeling that he'll only ever play one of Westwood or Cleverley. That would be a travesty.",0,1409725812,null,0,false,0,ck7tk83,t3_2f9l7j,t1_ck7tk83,t3_2f9l7j,null,1427223109,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1

I've had 4 heart attacks, so I have rampant heart disease along with a myriad of other issues.  I was declared fit for work and had to go to tribunal (which took a year of having no money, and being housebound - they declared in my favour in less than 5 minutes)

My ""spare"" bedroom, is used to store my oxygen tanks and mobility scooter.  Even though there is nowhere else to store them, it was deemed as not applicable for the bedroom tax to be waived under the disability rules.

&gt;My best friend has two prosthetic legs.  Due to her joints being fucked, she can't use them outside and must use a wheelchair.  She doesn't qualify for the upper rate and will also lose her wheelchair adapted car when the new rules are applied to her.

&gt;The same person was turned down for care allowance because she needs help at night.  At the tribunal the DSS representative suggested she should not drink any fluids after 4pm and then she wouldn't need help for bathroom.

&gt;A family friend has only 1 arm, metal rods in his spine, legally blind (he was in a car crash hit by drunk driver).  He was declared fit for work.

&gt;Under the old rules, if you could only walk up to 200m you would qualify for upper rate mobility.

true,APeacefulWarrior,null,null,"I have a theory on Doctor Who over the ages, which I jokingly call the Two Doctors theory.

Starting with (arguably) Three, there have only been two doctor types.  Jokey ones in lightweight 'comic book' stories, and darker ones in more detailed or politically-heavy storylines.  And they seem to consistently go back and forth.

(Three sort of straddles the line, since it was the first time the show really dealt with darker ""What happens when Earth finds out it's not alone?"" themes in the way Davies later would but, of course, with the  campiness also associated with the era.  Maybe that's one reason Three is so universally agreed to be a great Doctor - he appeals to both sides.)

So, someone who naturally  prefers one type or the other is going to enjoy other Doctors in the same style.  Like, I'm guessing fans of Moffat are also fans of the Graham Williams years.  OTOH, fans of Davies or later JNT are going to largely dislike Williams or Moffat.

And they tend to flip-flop over the years.  I can only imagine how jarring the Tom Baker years were to people back in the day, going from gothic horror, to high camp, to dark moralism in the span of 4-5 years.  Tom Baker got to be BOTH Doctors.

And it's the same flip-flop for us.  Davies was heavily dark and political, Moffat a lot lighter and ""comic bookish.""  At least so far, with Eleven, who was probably the most ""fantastical"" Doctor ever.

What I think will be interesting about this season is that Moffat is now, himself, trying to move from one style of Doctor to the other.   I'm curious to see if he can pull it off.

(Edit: For that matter, even the jump from dour One to clownish Two illustrates the principle, although I wouldn't tend to think any Two stories -besides War Games- as being particularly heavy or non-campy.  Then again, the  War Games was *really* fucking dark by the end, and I think still has the most disturbing regeneration.)",0,1409727416,null,0,1409728723,0,ck7txtd,t3_2f63ki,t1_ck7txtd,t3_2f63ki,null,1427222840,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

The Police are already covertly stealing our private communication data [without a court warrant](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/30/metropolitan-police-mobile-phone-surveillance), and they are also most likely getting access to our stolen private data, without a court warrant, from GCHQ. I say most likely, because this is happening in the United States between [law enforcement and the NSA](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/08/25/icreach-nsa-cia-secret-google-crisscross-proton/). The American government agencies have chosen to violate the constitution (their supreme laws), and have ditched probable cause in favour of our laughable, lower standard, of 'reasonable suspicion'.

Given the Communications Bill is constantly peddled around Parliament, our governments past mass violations of our privacy, legislation like RIPA and the Terrorism Act, and their co-conspirators in the NSA, then it's pretty likely, judging on past performance, GCHQ is routinely sharing our stolen data with Police Forces.

Thus I would go further than just body cameras. What's good for the goose... right? Record everything they do, including private conversations, personal and on the job correspondence, and the people they interact and have relations with, record them too, record EVERYTHING! Then make it accessible to private investigators and lawyers working on behalf of anyone charged with a crime. I can hear them now, 'But... but... we need that secrecy to be able to do our job effectively', or 'any defendant could destroy a police officers reputation through bad character, unproven allegations, and hearsay gleaned from private conversations'.

&gt;

&gt;Since the acceptance of the [Big Bang theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_theory) as the dominant [physical cosmological paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology), there have been a variety of reactions by religious groups as to its implications for their respective [religious cosmologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_cosmology). Some accept the scientific evidence at face value, while others harmonise the Big Bang with their religious tenets, and others completely reject or ignore the evidence for the Big Bang theory.

true,CaptainRaj,lfc99,,"@Matcht and @Helpopotamus - I totally agree with you both.  I was surprised to see you weren't heavily downvoted on here as people seem to love Mignolet disproportionately.  I often avoid commenting on him as some people get their rage on.

My main problem with Mignolet is, demonstrated again Southampton and City (along with many games last season), his distribution from simple back passes.  He gives the ball away a lot and that gives the opposition more confidence and a head of steam.  They keep getting the ball back so can keep attacking.  He also ""floats"" the ball behind the intended target so the player has to turn to face goal to receive it and so we're on the back foot again.  This was, imo, the reason why Southampton came into the game.  Mignolet did this multiple times last season.  I suppose it doesn't help my case when Mignolet makes a utterly brilliant reflex save at some point in a game.  But 1 brilliant save does not make up for 3 or 4 mistakes in each game.

As was said, I don't think Mignolet is close to one of the best in the league.  Valdes would take a little time, but I think he could get very close to his best again, making his potentially the best 'keeper in the league.  Having a great 'keeper behind you gives the entire team a lot of confidence.  ",0,1409732356,null,0,false,0,ck7uwuy,t3_2fao1f,t1_ck7uwuy,t1_ck7gfwo,null,1427222066,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

* An England u-21 international (Chambers, 16m) who has held his own thrown in the deep end out of position and won us 3 points singlehandledly and scored 2 (who knows how valuable that will be come 38 games). . Educated at arguably the top 3 academy in the world (Barca, Ajax, Sporting - imo) for the price of Falque

* A left back that has earned Rose a England call up, competition, and is a solid British LB with EPL experience/great potential and a more defensive minded full back for us to flip things around

* A second choice keeper that fits our system perfectly. Unlike Brad, who REALLY is getting on now

* To early to call on Yedlin. He held his own against Hazard 1 on 1 (albeit in the World Cup), didn't look overawe'd at ALL and will raise our profile. Who knows, he could be the first GREAT American player (Dempsey, Donovan etc were very good, but not insane). Yedlin I don't think is a novelty - I might be proven wrong, but I feel he can raise his game to any level needed and is a Walker-lite. 

* Stamboli comes from a much more prestigious background club wise than Schneiderlin - who was at Strasburg (sp?) and then played in League 1. Stamboli has top European football under his belt and seems a tidy player for like 1/4 of the price. Comes across well too and has some tasty stats for his club. Could also form a nice French partnership with Hugo, Capoue &amp; Bentaleb who I presume speaks fluent French. 

* Fazio is a EPL defender through and through. Musacchio was a Chiriches v2, we have Jan/Vlad, Fazio/Kaboul then Dier once Kaboul falls apart/leaves.

The result is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights."" - Albert Einstein

""Do you want to live in a country where a handful of billionaires control our economy and our political life while the middle class disappears? That is the question of our time. We've got to stand up and fight back"" - Sen. Bernie Sanders

""Welfare state capitalism . . . rejects the fair value of the political liberties, and while it has some concern for equality of opportunity, the policies necessary to achieve that are not followed. It permits very large inequalities in the ownership of real property (productive assets and natural resources) so that the control of the economy and much of political life rests in few hands...

A second reason for controlling economic and social inequalities is to prevent one part of society from dominating the rest.

true,p7r,uk,United Kingdom,"The Oyster scheme is great, but it has flaws, particularly for visitors who do not know how it works in detail. 

There are *many* people in London who *do* know how it works and exploit those flaws in order to get free travel. 

This annoys ticket inspectors a great deal. It annoys me as somebody who pays £120/month for a Zone 1/2 season ticket a great deal. TfL employ an army of inspectors, and I'm glad of it.

So to be clear, unless you have a season ticket (you can get a day ticket which does the same thing):

1. You must scan in before you start a journey

2. You must scan out at the end of the journey

3. If you only do one of them or you do both at the same station on the same journey (so you enter a station and then immediately leave it), you will be charged a maximum fare automatically. You might be able to ask for this to be refunded if you can explain how it happened.

4. If you are on transport and have not scanned in and do not have a season ticket on your card, you are travelling without a ticket.

5. It is therefore your responsibility to make sure you always scan in, and the police at stations should immediately understand if you say ""I haven't scanned in, I can't board this train, I don't have a validated oyster card, I need to go and do that"". If you are calm and polite, they'll give you the chance to scan in.

6. Most tube stations have barriers preventing you from getting near a train without scanning in, likewise scanning out on the way out. Bus drivers are there to make you scan in, you don't need to scan out (fixed fare buses are great). The two big gaps are the Overground and DLR, but also some out of the way tube stations, where at many stations it is up to you to remember to do all this. At those stations *it is your responsibility as a condition of carriage to remember to scan in and out*.

We have all forgotten to scan out at Greenwich DLR or something. It happens. There are processes to deal with it.

The inspector on finding you had not scanned in, and seeing you did not have a season ticket, will immediately have his training kick in. 

That little beeping toy in his hand? His superiors might get data off that for all we know, and see that he scanned you without a ticket and his job might be on the line if he can not explain what he did about you being on a train without a ticket. By not doing his job with you, he could lose his home. See it from his position.

You understandably think he over-reacted. From his perspective though, you were on a train without a ticket. You were as far as TfL policy is concerned, fare-evading. 

It was something you could easily avoid (you had enough money on your card), so in his mind he is asking why had you not scanned in? They are trained to assume that you are a long-term scammer and to issue you with a deterrent from future criminal behaviour in the form of a fine.

It does not excuse him grabbing you, it does not excuse him being hostile and it does not excuse him not listening to you. But it also sounds like you over-reacted to the situation a little. Your calmness might have been seen by him as criminal coolness, and when you lost your calm a little bit, that re-enforced his view you were a bad 'un. Good job your Dad was there to cool things down.

Next time, I suggest getting a day ticket when you arrive in London. Then it doesn't matter if you can't scan in, as you have a valid season ticket at all points.

Otherwise I would go for the tactic of self-effacing humour. Push up your brummie accent and be all ""These London coppers wouldn't let me scan in mate, I feel like a right idiot. Is there anything I can do to appeal it?"" and take the fine. If you're nice they might let you off. If they don't, you can appeal it.

true,Suttreee,lfc99,,"**Aston Villa** will be our next fixture, at Anfield. They've had a good start to the season and they've bought Cleverly, but I still think we should be pretty confident of a win here. Villa has beaten Hull and Stoke so far, and drawn to Newcastle. If this was an away fixture I'd be more nervous, but at Anfield this should really be a sitter.

**Last meeting at Anfield**: 2-2 with Villa going two up before Sturridge and Gerrard made it even.

**My guess**: 3-0, Balotelli, Sterling, Sturridge


**West Ham** in London follows the week after. West Ham currently have 3 points from nine possible, beating Swansea away but losing to Tottenham and Southampton at home. Before they play us they will play Hull away.

This is again a game we really should be winning. So far this season West Ham lost both home-fixtures against teams we've beaten already. They're a tough side but I think we'll be to good for them.

**Last game at Boleyn**: 1-2 (when Carroll assaulted Mignolet). Two goals from Gerrard and a goal from Guy Demel.

**My guess**: 1-3, Sturridge x2, Henderson


**Everton** at home isn't going to be an easy match for sure, but we crushed them last season and it seems likely we just might do it again. Everton have an exciting team, but haven't fared all to well against big sides lately (although they were better than Arsenal). They have 2 points out of 9 so far this season, after drawing with Leicester and Arsenal and losing to Chelsea.

**Last game at Anfield** 4-0, Gerrard, Sturridge x2 and Suarez

**My guess** 4-0, Gerrard, Sturridge x2, Balotelli


**West Bromwich** will be the next time to arrive at Anfield, having 2 points from their 9 possible so far and with their fixtures in between being Everton, Tottenham and Burnley, they might not be much better of by the time they get to Anfield. They may also be distracted when they visit us, because their next game will be a relegation battle six-pointer; WBA-MU.

**Last fixture at Anfield**: a 4-1 victory for us, with Suarez bagging 3 and [this fantastic little chip from Sturridge.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcUt44tYz8w)

**My guess** Harder game than it looks, 2-1 to us. Lovren and Lallana.


**QPR** then awaits us in London, with 3 points currently after losing to Hull, getting smacked by Spurs and beating Sunderland 1-0. At this point it'll be pointless to guess what their form will be like, due to four fixtures being in between our last and this one, but even away I think it's safe to say that fans, players and BR alike will all expect a win here.

**Last fixture at Loftus Road**: 0-3: Suarez x2, Agges: However, this was in the 2012/2013 season.

**My guess** I feel Hendo's gonna be scoring a bit more forward. 1-2, Hendo, Sterling

This makes the PAAMS system particularly difficult to swamp during a saturation attack, even against supersonic targets.[37] The US Naval War College has suggested that the SAMPSON radar is capable of tracking 1,000 objects the size of a cricket ball travelling at three times the speed of sound (Mach 3), emphasising the system's capabilities against high performance stealth targets.[35]""

He is a box to box midfielder - i.e. he is good at defending and attacking (tackling, passing and shooting). One of the issues he is facing is that the coaches he has worked with so far at Spurs (i.e. AVB and MP - Sherwood wasn't a coach) have systems that divide the midfield into defence (2 holding) and attack (3 attacking/creating).

AVB's system was very different to Poch's system in that the creativity/threat came from wide so the middle player in the front three was supposed to shuttle between the defending pair and the attacking three. I think AVB had his eye on both Dembele and Paulinho in this role as they are able to run both boxes. Their interchangeability was a plus point. Sandro or Capoue was to be the anchor.

MP's system is different in that one of the defensive anchors that shuttle into the centre of defence (a bit like an old fashioned sweeper). So in reality you need a ball playing defender (like Capoue) and some serious legs (like Bentaleb/Stambouli). I don't think Paulinho is a good fit for either of these roles.

That's not to say that MP won't find a use for him.

When everyone in the local area speaks your language, when everyone in your school, and all the local shops and public services speak your language, there really isn't any need to learn English.

The trouble with that sort of a situation is that if it's a man hitting a woman, if you call them out on it, you're likely to have one potentially violent individual against you, but it's relatively unlikely that he'll go at you because firstly, you might hit back, and a secondly, because he probably knows he was acting shamefully. If it's woman hitting man though, you're not only insulting the woman by calling her out, you're also insulting the man, because you're making him out to be some sissy little bitch who can't handle his woman. It's pretty well established that people who are being shat on tend to reestablish their alpha standing by shitting on others, so intervening in that sort of a situation can be dangerous.

&gt;

&gt;__Apple cider__ (also called __sweet cider__ or __soft cider__) is the name used in the United States and parts of Canada for an unfiltered, unsweetened, [non-alcoholic beverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_beverage) made from [apples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple). Apple cider is easy and inexpensive to produce.  It may be opaque due to fine apple particles in suspension and may be tangier than conventional filtered [apple juice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_juice), depending on the apples used. 

&gt;This untreated cider is a seasonally produced drink  of limited shelf-life that is typically available only in [fall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn), although it is sometimes frozen for use throughout the year. It is traditionally served on the [Halloween](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween), [Thanksgiving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving), [Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas) and various [New Year's Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s_Eve) holidays, sometimes heated and [mulled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulled_wine). It is the official state beverage of [New Hampshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire).

But there is no doubt air traffic is being routed around Southern Wales, take [AAL87 ](http://uk.flightaware.com/live/flight/AAL87/history/20140903/0915Z/EGLL/KORD)for example, usually flies over Wales but it's taking a route like the one I described above. 

Funnily enough the flight would normally go far closer to Malvern than it currently is, so I've really not helped OP at all.

AAL87 took the same path I described in the end. I seem to be getting down votes because people are sceptical that all transatlantic flights don't fly over Wales, which is a bit of strange one.

One of the key components of the original cold war 1980s defense against a Russian invasion of Europe was based on fast moving mechanized infantry units in vehicles just like this.

**[Check this video out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMDdsXmkshA)**, its an army educational video from 1982 going through the strategy at a unit level. 

At any rate, its easy to get blindsided by the seemingly obvious ""single biggest threat"" - Russian expansion in Europe, which in reality are very unlikely to actually result in a straight up war... whilst simultaneously missing the less obvious but perhaps more likely threats like a limited sino-japanese confrontation in the Pacific or aggressive expansion of the Islamic State.

Just because you can't specifically envisage these being used doesn't mean they are useful. Clearly, the army composed of actual soldiers who will actually have to fight and die in future conflicts decided these would be useful... so they probably had good reason for thinking that.

It was only a few decades ago that there were no DV shelters in the UK. Any feminist worth their salt will tell you that violence against women wasn't taken seriously and that feminism achieved a great amount in changing attitudes. If feminists were as passionate about violence against men as you would have us believe why would they be giving up at this point?

Tories? No chance. The last four years have been pretty grim and theyve removed a lot of workers protections and the welfare state that did a pretty good job of evening out the effects of low pay.

UKIP? Lol no. Stand a good chance of tanking the economy if they withdraw us from the EU because of increased taxes on trade. Developing enhanced links with the commonwealth is bloody useless as apart from New Zealand, Canada, Australia and South Africa, most of the rest arent first world countries and there is no way they could absorb the trade surplus we would have.

Green: No. While I want to vote for a lot of their good socialist policies, they come packaged with a lot of things that are simply unworkable or based on bad science. We *need* nuclear power because we *need* intense amounts of energy. Nuclear power provides gigawatts per square kilometer while wind power only a fraction of that. Dont get me wrong, we need green energy, but there is no way to get the energy we need without carpeting huge swathes of the countryside with wind farms - and that land could be used for housing, farming etc.

Lib Dem - Eh. Im very indifferent to them. I still hold a large amount of antipathy for their tuition fees bollocks. 

Labour - Least terrible of a bad bunch. They have done nothing to distinguish themselves and have steadily crept further rightward with only the token left wing policy to keep an increasingly disillusioned voter base onside. 

In the same way that UKIP is splitting the conservative vote, the Labour party itself will probably split in the next two years or so as the labour party is set on going right to meet tory policy while the Unions, representing the people getting fucked by conservative politics (cost of living, stagnant wages, rising inequality etc) are keeping a firm anchor in left wing politics.

As far as Remy goes I really haven't seen much of him but people seem optimistic. I'm happy that we got a replacement in for Torres quickly and cheaply, but have no idea whether he's a good signing on the pitch. Time will tell I suppose. I'd give it a 6 just out of my own uncertainty.

Also, I noticed that I was in the very small minority of those who didn't want to get rid of Cech. I can't believe so many of you thought we should have done so. If he's happy to stay and fight, there's no reason why we shouldn't allow him to do so. It's not as if we needed the money to finance other transfers that didn't happen. And anyway, we've proven with the Mata and Luiz sales that even if our highly rated players aren't getting consistent playing time, we can still sell them off for inflated values if necessary. 

I think he'll be a great resource for Courtois to learn from even if he doesn't manage to get much game time. And if he doesn't, he'll leave in January.

true,primal_buddhist,lfc68,,"Agreed (with your /s). We won't use the double pivot until/unless we start to develop Can as that sort of player instead of Stevie, perhaps next to Hendo. That would potentially work against superior teams where we need extra cover. 

This could work if it meant allowing more pacy creative players ahead - so marko, lallana and sterling with a striker. 

But what is the scenario?

If we are on top, against bus-parking, then the 4123 we played against Spurs is fine - in attack it morphs to 3 4 3 with the full backs in midfield and Stevie deep between the two CBs who are wide. 

If we are against a superior team, then our FBs will stay back (cos our three in attack can counter at will with enough numbers to achieve overload) so I am still not sure about the need for two deep midfielders. 

And I think we will see two strikers a fair amount, so again, one holding. 

I think that both Stevie and Lucas both perform better alone - they know what falls to them much more obviously than if there is someone else who might also be covering. The whole when to go when to stay dilemma that also plagued England when they tried to play two centre mids that could also attack.

Similarly, we could capture far more crime if we covered absolutely every inch of the UK with a camera, but that would be a higher level of surveillance, which people may not be happy with.

Guildford as a town is quite expensive to live in. It is great for shopping for clothes and things like that. There aren't that many cheap shops in the town centre though. You have a Tesco as your main supermarket next to the campus.

- There are a ton of nice restaurants in the town centre, ranging from the usual chain fast food places to some more expensive places. 
- There's quite a lot of pubs and bars, with a good live music scene. 
- The night life is ok, not amazing. The clubs are normally just full of 18 year olds, but maybe that's just when I normally go out. It's probably different during uni term time. 
- There is a SU club on campus but I've never been.

The part that disturbs me the most is the implication that *we simply don't care* about certain parts of our population that we consider a burden rather then an asset.

A while back during a (regular media) scandle around NHS nursing it became clear that nurses were ignoring some of their elderly charges. Although reports and reviews pointed fingers at various nusing groups, the subtext was that empathy isn't something easily trained into people; if society in general doesn't care much for the welfare of the elderly, then why would we expect nurses too?

He's an alright player, but I really can't see him offering much in many of the positions we have available, apart from maybe in Bentaleb/Dembeles position, but does he break up play enough? He doesn't seem to put the effort in to press and follow the ball. 

I'm still unconvinced by him and what value he can bring to our team, and whilst he'll probably shine against lower teams, I don't think he's good enough and I would have preferred to keep our other Brazilian in the squad or that Icelandic genius that would have played in probably all the positions that Paulinho will get a chance this year to play in.

I pirate things because I can. I have more than enough money to buy any entertainment I want (and I do subscribe to Netflix, Spotify and buy things from iTunes etc).

doctors - made a judgement in the balance of treatment vs available options and child's suitability, but too unwilling to consider the parents views and allowed relationship to breakdown, potential lack of second opinions (its not clear how they arrived at their conclusions and whether they were really considering proton options or had been dismissed). 

parents - perhaps they are correct that proton therapy will help their child - or at least are willing to take the chance that it is, against prevailing opinion / cost benefit . probably wrong to run away abroad unless they genuinely exhausted a less drastic way to make it happen (if they were planning on selling a house and paying for treatment, could the child have stayed in the hospital whilst they did that?). 

so neither party is totally right or totally wrong - add into that a fairly blunt reaction from the police, local council and CPS and that catalogue of problems created the crazy situation.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I completely agree with Jack Straw. Ironically it was Tony Blairs (Middle East peace envoy!) war that has made this entire country weary of military action, even when it's really needed.

I agree with you here, I sometimes thing we have the worst possible military policy, going to war when we shouldn't AND staying at home when we should.  Worse than either being too aggressive or pacificstic.

That said, I think a lot of these decisions are much more complicated, specifically Osama Bin Laden stated repeatedly that his plan was to draw the US into a protracted ground war that would radicalise and unite Muslims and bankrupt the US.  Sept 11th was supposed to achieve that.  It seems his plan worked at least in part because the US was so predictable.  In fact he was relying on that predictable attack-&gt;war-&gt;occupation-&gt;insurgency pathway.

So when I see ISIS acting un-acceptably, actively attempting to incite the west, before I go straight to the (much deserved) military option, I wonder if that is what ISISs actual cheifs and backers want and whether we are letting them lead us to somewhere we can't win (occupation of Iraq/Syria?, radicalization of our own Muslim populations by heavy handed policing?).

I don't think /u/Azzah is saying it does, just that refusing or be slow to adapt is not helping their case.  I pirate pretty much all the TV I watch for the following reasons:

 * I can watch US shows within 24 hours of them airing there rather than waiting weeks, months or years to catch them here, assuming they are shown here at all.

 * I can watch them when and where I want,  If I want to spend a weekend watching an entire early season of *Mythbusters* on my tablet without having to jump through DRM hoops or not being able to watch anything other than the latest season I can.

 * There's far more choice.  I'm not limited to whatever show happens to be doing well in the US ratings, someone somewhere will have uploaded the latest episode of *Massive Aquariums* even if only 200 other people download it.

 * No Ads. Yes, this is how the networks make money, but once you've seen one talking animal selling insurance you've seen them all.

 * I can keep the shows for as long as I want.  If I really liked that episode of Doctor Who where Billie Piper had a nip-slip I can leave it sitting on my hard-drive indefinitely. 

The downsides are that I have to mess around with either proxies or VPNs to use my favourite torrent sites, and I have to check them daily to keep up to day.

None of those actually excuse pirating, but they all make my life slightly less stressful.

Give me a service where I can pick and choose any show from any season from any network, watch it on my TV, my phone or my tablet without having to stream it off the net to each device and I'll throw money at them.

Every time we appeased him it just made him stronger and more difficult to topple.  

Not to mention that the Russians had been trying very hard to link up with us to combat fascism or some considerable time and we'd merely played them, to the point where they were pretty much forced into their non-aggression pact with Hitler as their only means of giving _themselves_ time to prepare and rearm for a lone stand.

true,tomisthemovie,null,Recruiter,"To be perfectly honest with you, the proof is in the pudding. The most impressive developer I ever placed back when I was working in an agency was almost entirely self taught, and last I heard he was being courted by a couple of Silicon Valley companies. So it's definitely not a detriment to a candidates abilities if they're self taught. The main thing to remember is that hiring managers will look for evidence of ability. That means having some examples of your code to take along to interviews, or being able to competently pass a coding exam. I know Sky is a proponent of paired programming, something that an online course like Treehouse or Code Academy can't recreate. Therefore, if you can meet the initial requirements of the tasks you're expected to perform, a lot of hiring managers won't mind where you began your journey.

A couple more things to keep in mind when you're looking round for work. The basics can be learned from online courses, but having some experience working in an office with a team and working out problems together will be invaluable. Start ups will take a 'gamble' on someone raw and in need of tuning, but you're going to have to be able to work with people in those kind of environments. When the shit hits the fan, that's something an online course won't be able to tell you. Recruiters will use these sort of things to weigh up a candidates suitability more than they will wherever they learned to code.

And a comforting thought: IT recruiters aren't developers, or at least most of them aren't. A lot of crap/lucky ones wouldn't be able to tell you a Ruby script from a Visual Basic one. There's a lot of people that just do word matching from job specs to CV's. Therefore, save the tech knowledge for the interview unless your recruiter knows his salt. If so, you know you're in safe hands.

true,CastrosExplodinCigar,,Randalstown,"I hate it to break it to you but as I said to/u/suicidegame, many Christian denominations do not subscribe to the literal interpretation of the bible. 

For example; in the OT when God flooded the earth in the story of Noah and he got 2 of every animal. If you interpret that literally, Noah got Pandas and species not native to the middle east on that boat. However, let's interpret that realistically. The known world at the time of Noah was only about say 500 square miles. That's what they knew the world to be. They did not know about Europe, they did not know about China, America, Australia simply because their knowledge did not extend beyond what they couldn't walk/ride to. So when ""God"" flooded the earth, it was just a big flood of land that used to regularly flood because of ice caps in the Ethiopian mountains, rising sea levels in the dead/red sea and quite possibly, the ice age at that time coming to an end. The animals that Noah got on his big boat were simply the animals that were around him at the time from his world. He did not get Giraffes, lions or penguins because they did not exist to him. That is a realistic interpretation of the bible as opposed to a literal one.

Also, many believe in evolution, there's a theory that used to be called the Missing Link. Evolution of humans can be traced up to a certain point and then evolution leaps. Some Christians believe that's when God came down and zapped a certain primate making them smarter than the average ape, made them walk upright, made them conscious etc.

I know over time as scientists, archeologists and geologists discover more ancient remains of our ancestors, this theory will just go out of fashion. ",0,1409749336,null,0,1409752047,0,ck7yh89,t3_2faqkl,t1_ck7yh89,t1_ck7qtba,null,1427219860,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1

Poch never had to play in Europe at Southampton, so doesn't necessarily have on-the-ground knowledge of what it takes to manage a squad across two competitions.  As the author says, you can more or less start the same XI every week at Southampton... you can't with us.  The fact that he got rid of Holtby when there was no real need to and no adequate replacement on hand is puzzling.

I don't know that a manager should necessarily put out the same XI to face Liverpool as QPR.  Obviously it's early in the season and I'm sure he's prioritising the team settling over chopping and changing every week, but it is fairly naive to think what worked against QPR was going to yield similar results on Sunday.

That's where Rodgers has really proven himself... not just changing personnel, but changing shape frequently within a season.  The very fact he started Balotelli proves that he's a very progressive thinker in that regard... very few managers in the EPL would start a new striker with a history of volatility the week he arrives whilst away at a potential top 4 rival.  And yet... Mario should've (and easily could've) had a hattrick.

[Premier League squad list 2014]

Explanation:
Relevant part of rule A.1.85: ""...three Seasons or 36 months prior to his 21st birthday (or the end of the Season during which he turns 21) and for the purposes of this definition of “Home Grown Player” a Season will be deemed to commence on the date on which the first Transfer Window closes and expire on the date of the final League Match of the Season;""

Schneiderlin's D.O.B is 8/11/89 date of transfer was 27/6/2008 - i.e. he was 18 and 7mth old.

3 Questions:

(i). Does he serve 3 seasons (i.e. end of window to last match) before 21st birthday?

No. Last season ends 14 May 2011. Where he is 21 years and 6mths.

(ii). Does he instead serve 36 mths prior to his 21st birthday?

No. He serves 29mths at Southampton before his 21st birthday.

(iii). Does he instead serve ""36mths prior to end of season which he turns 21""?

Yes. Due to the fact that he turns 21 in November during season 10/11 he is under 21 until the end of the season May 2011 meaning that for the 6mths he is technically over 21 he is still under 21 for the purposes of the HGP rule and therefore qualifies as home grown.

I have included the link to the squad numbers for season 13/14 to show his HGP status.

I also heard that in some areas, the restaurants only have German menu's. I think when you head to the southern areas/islands, the entire economies are completely economically depressed and dependant on regional subsidies and tourism so there is a natural incentive for the locals to speak English/German.

Most people speak English in the area where I lived, and if they see you putting a slight bit of effort into speaking Spanish or even better, the local dialect, they are always very happy to help once they realise you are stuck. 

However, if you don't make an effort you get no love.

Moving spending from a recurring service over to empowering somebody and helping them contribute more to this country would be a strong and confident move.

But he isn't suggesting that at all. He's just saying ""fuck 'em, I don't care if they rot"".

He doesn't actually want them to learn English. He wants them to fail at living in the UK and to return to their native countries, or if they can't afford it and can't figure out how to claim benefits, great, they can just curl up over there in a corner and die: result!

If he had the balls to just say that's what he wants, I'd at least have a modicum of respect for him for at least being honest. The fact he won't is just typical of the hidden agenda racism of UKIP councillors all over the country.

He is prepared for families to go hungry and homeless because they can't access basic services they are entitled to receive if they are struggling. That's pretty fucking low.

&gt;Britain has a native population.

The phrase  ""native British"" is racist when used in the context of modern  Britain because no such thing exist any more, it is a historic term.  Especially when used to *explicitly* exclude people with brown skin as you have done. 

Indeed, in the wiki article you helpfully link to on the 'English People', it even says:
&gt; Today some English people have recent forebears from other parts of the United Kingdom while some are also descended from more recent immigrants from other European countries and from the Commonwealth.

So, the Britons ( the original *native* population of these Islands) ceased to exist as a distinct group in around the 5th Century (again, from your own link on The Britons). They have been replaced with the current English population who have ancestors from all over Europe and the commonwealth. 

This includes [dramatic music] people with dark skin. 

So when you said earlier:
&gt;English/Scottish/Welsh/Irish people with white skin are native to Britain.

with reference to the current inhabitants of the UK, you were being either ignorant or racist. I don't mind which.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;The point of instructive and informative literature is not to test whether people are worthy of living in the UK, it is to instruct and inform everyone so that society can function.

In order to enter this country legally you need to already have a certain level of English language skills, certainly enough to fill out a form, everyone in this country should already have the ability to fill out a council form in English. 

The problem is that after they arrive many people lose these language skills, they might join isolated communities of immigrants which do not integrate into the rest of society. Where everyone around them speaks a foreign language, including the local shops and schools. This creates an environment where there is no incentive to learn English, and so makes the chances of integration even less likely. 

If you live in this country legally you will already have a basic grasp of English, and we should be doing everything we can to encourage people to use these language skills they are developing. If we don't provide any reason to use them, they are going to lose those skills, which is why there are some people in this country who have almost no ability to communicate in English. 

We shouldn't create an environment where is is possible to live your life without every having to interact with anyone or anything in English. Many countries across Europe do not provide translation services for this reason.

But bear in mind the Challenger is over a decade old and MoD has no plans to replace it 

&gt;A British military document from 2001 indicated that the British Army would not procure a replacement for the Challenger 2 because of a lack of foreseeable conventional threats in the future

The battle legends (bear in mind the IED was not using CHOBHAM)

&gt;During the 2003 invasion of Iraq the Challenger 2 tanks suffered no tank losses to enemy fire, although one was penetrated by an IED. This was, at the time, unprotected by ""Dorchester"" armour. The driver was injured. In one encounter within the urban area a Challenger 2 came under attack from irregular forces with machine guns and rocket propelled grenades. The driver's sight was damaged and while attempting to back away under the commander's directions, the other sights were damaged and the tank threw its tracks entering a ditch. It was hit directly by fourteen rocket propelled grenades from close range and a MILAN anti-tank missile.The crew survived remaining safe within the tank until the tank was recovered for repairs, the worst damage being to the sighting system. It was back in operation six hours later after repairs. One Challenger 2 operating near Basra survived being hit by 70 RPGs in another incident

One that few people know about

&gt;In August 2006 in al-Amarah, a Soviet RPG-29 damaged the underside of a Challenger 2, detonating ERA in the area of the driver's cabin. The driver lost part of his foot and two more of the crew were also injured but the driver was able to reverse 1.5 mi (2.4 km) to an aid post. The incident was not made public until May 2007; in response to accusations, the MoD said ""We have never claimed that the Challenger 2 is impenetrable.""

More form Wiki:

&gt;Two Challenger 2s have been damaged in combat, one of which was destroyed:

&gt;25 March 2003 – A friendly fire (""blue-on-blue"") incident in Basra in which one Challenger 2 of the Black Watch Battlegroup (2nd Royal Tank Regiment) mistakenly engaged another Challenger 2 of the Queen's Royal Lancers after detecting what was believed to be an enemy flanking manoeuvre on thermal equipment. The attacking tank's second HESH round hit the open commander's hatch lid of the QRL tank sending hot fragments into the turret, killing two crew members. The strike caused a fire that eventually led to an explosion of the stowed ammunition, destroying the tank. It remains the only Challenger 2 to be completely destroyed on operations.
&gt;6 April 2007 – in Basra, Iraq, an IED shaped charge penetrated the underside of the tank resulting in the driver losing three of his toes and causing minor injuries to another soldier.

&gt;To help prevent incidents of this nature happening again, Challenger 2s have been upgraded with a new passive armour package, including the use of add-on armour manufactured by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems of Israel. When deployed on operations the Challenger 2 is now normally upgraded to TES (Theatre Entry Standard) which includes a number of modifications including armour and weapon system upgrades.

We should also bear in mind that not *everyone* who comes here is to get work and integrate. There are the families of immigrants, especially very old parents or grandparents, who may need to be near their kids so that they have emotional and physical support when necessary. Elderly people understandably find it very difficult to adjust to the different culture and almost impossible to learn the local language to a fluent level at their advanced age. I think it's a shame to essentially force them to have to get their children to do everything for them when it comes to interactions with the government. If they are brave enough to venture out to the local council offices or whatever to fill in their whatever form, they should be helped if language becomes an issue.

Encouraging immigrants to learn English is a good thing, and your heart is in the right place. But this kind of blanket measure is not an effective way of reaching that goal in my opinion.

When ever I have been in Europe and observed 2 people from 2 different countries communicate, it's always in English. i.e a French guy in Germany will talk English to a German. I think for the most part everyone does have at least a basic grasp of English, and the majority speak it pretty damn well. [edit] Most of Europe tend to learn it from quite a young age, and pick it up from US TV and from music etc

Having lived in several different European countries for most of my life, I can tell you that the level of English is for the most part terrible and dealing with local councils, magistrates etc. can be hell on earth. Sure the occasional worker will speak some broken English, enough to work it out, but it's far from most of them. All of their American tv and films are dubbed in their native languages which is why their level of English tends to be poor. By far the best non-native speakers of English tend to be the Scandinavians and the Dutch (Flemish Belgians, too) since they don't dub their television and they learn it from a young age.

I’m entirely in favour of making a safe space for children and the elderly and the less confident to also cycle – but I’m certain that plenty of existing cyclists (myself included) would also use it. 

What remains to be seen – and we’ll have to look at this 20 years down the road and one of us can say ‘I told you so’ – is whether, given the infrastructure, people really do start cycling like we assume they will if only they had a safe space to do it – or if car and road use will remain level / only show a slight decline.

I know someone who was involved in the 10 o'clock live production they told me that the biggest problem was that there were too many egos in the room and often good ideas would get shot down because people didn't work together well. So they ended up with a show where each presenter had a segment each. In their own style and presentation, this resulted in different stories delivered in different styles. The show ended up looking like a mishmash with nothing really gelling together. The show was the last thing on their minds.

That said, The Thick of It, a UK show that had a team of writers displays all of the things you get from TDS. It's very very good, world class in fact.

And... Let's not forget John Oliver. He has gone from TDS to HBO, created Last Week Tonight (The name screams homage to TW3) and if you want to see what The Daily Show doesn't do well, watch Last Week Tonight. It's very, very good.

However Chelsea did recruit Spanish players and even Benayoun, now were they best friends with Torres I don't know, he did seem to have good on field chemistry with Mata just couldn't finish. We did get Benitez in briefly which saw a slight improvement in Torres' form albeit against lesser opposition. And the fans were pretty decent to Torres.

Now bearing in mind I've got 7 years work experience, an NVQ level 2 in business admin and plenty of payroll and IT certificates from courses completed in my time in work. 5 of those 7 years were in payroll for the NHS, the final year of which we switched to a new payroll system, which involved all sorts of testing and upgrading old systems we had in the office.

The unit titles of the course I was sent on were;

Using Email

Using the internet

Spreadsheet software

Word processing software

Introduction to business and administration

Reception skills

Teamwork.


Want to know why I got sent on such a course? (Which lasted a gruelling 2 weeks.. It could have seriously been completed in a day were it not for shitty pub quizzes and literal colouring in and poster making). I asked for my advisor to have a quick glance over one of my job specific CV's before I started sending it off. She didn't look at it, just sent me straight to that course with the threat of being sanctioned if I refused. I now know not to say anything to them other than what is necessary to get out of the place knowing that I'll still be able to afford rent at the end of the month.

Although saying that, it didn't stop them from trying to pass through 9 separate sanctions for me in the span of the last 6 months, all of which have been overturned after jumping through appeal hoops and spending hours upon hours chasing it up, all for them sending my post out to wrong addresses and the times they did the the right address, sending appointment letters out 2 days before a meeting using 2nd class postage.

The whole thing felt like it didn’t move things at along at all. They went to a Dalek… went inside to fix it / broke things more / put them sort of right… and that’s it. At least the Dalek actually shot things but they still don’t feel like the threat they ought to. 

Meanwhile I don’t know what to make of Capaldi – it feels like he hasn’t finished regenerating yet or something. He has some great one-liners but it feels like he’s very disconnected from what’s happening around him (which may be the point – but there’s nothing ominous about it, it doesn’t feel like The Doctor – just that he’s not settled into the part).

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"There's a lot of bullshit from the fashion industry in advertising, but American Apparel somehow manages to be consistently worse than the rest. It's not just that they employ deliberately ambiguous images suggesting the sexualisation of children and that they treat female models as sex objects, it's that the adult male models by contrast are allowed to wear clothes in a normal way and to adopt natural poses. 

It's the same issue as with comic-books, no matter what a woman is doing you have to see her underwear or a load of skin, even if she's fighting zombies in the apocalypse it'll be in a string bikini. 


They also had a hiring policy based on looks, not sure if that's still current though. 

I don't choose to spend my money there, using soft-core porn where only women are used as sex objects, to sell clothes on the high street isn't 'provocative' it's sleazy, their images are more sexualised than the lingerie brands for goodness sake!  

This isn't about porn, this isn't distributed as porn, it's high street advertising that people have to walk past everyday and we wouldn't let M&amp;S or John Lewis or any UK brand get away with it, so American Apparel shouldn't either. 


-----

Also, this is just a personal complaint, but the public sexualisation of school uniforms bothered me as a teen because some local prostitutes wore them so I would get bothered by sleazy men when I was in my school uniform when I was only 13/14. I don't mind it in controlled contexts where everyone's an adult and that's clear, like in a school-uniform night at a club that ID's people entering, but when there's ambiguity as to ages and whether someone is a child or an adult it's just creeeeepy as creeepy can be.

was  referring to a picture of some dark skinned children donating food to a food bank.

&gt;

&gt;The __Commonwealth of Nations__, commonly known as __the Commonwealth__ (formerly the __British Commonwealth__), [(https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations#endnote_a) is an [intergovernmental organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_organization) of 53 [member states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_Commonwealth_of_Nations)  that were mostly [territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_evolution_of_the_British_Empire) of the former [British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire). The Commonwealth operates by [intergovernmental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmentalism) [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making) of the member states, organised through the [Commonwealth Secretariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Secretariat), and [non-governmental organisations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization), organised through the [Commonwealth Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Foundation). 

&gt;The Commonwealth dates back to the mid 20th century with the [decolonisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonisation) of the British Empire through increased [self-governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-governance) of its territories. It was formally constituted by the [London Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Declaration) in 1949, which established the member states as ""free and equal"".  The symbol of this free association is Queen [Elizabeth II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II) who is the [Head of the Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_the_Commonwealth). The Queen is also the [monarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch) of 16 members of the Commonwealth, known as *[Commonwealth realms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_realms)*. The other members of the Commonwealth have different persons as head of state: 32 members are [republics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic) and five members are [monarchies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy) with a different monarch.

&gt;Member states have no legal obligation to one another. Instead, they are united by language, history, culture, and their shared values of [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy), [human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights), and the [rule of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law).  These values are enshrined in the [Commonwealth Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_Commonwealth)  and promoted by the quadrennial [Commonwealth Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games). On 3 October 2013, after 48 years of membership, [the Gambia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gambia) became the most recent nation to withdraw from the Commonwealth.

If there was one book most worth reading I would argue it's Smarter Investing by Tim Hale. It gives you all the basic grounding that you need to know in an easy-to-digest manner.

Another good source for information is www.monevator.com, though the writers are very opinionated and not great fans of people in my profession.

You could potentially seek financial advice, and pay a fixed fee for some recommendations, or even pay Hargreaves Lansdown directly for advice (they offer telephone-based advice for a fee), but at your level of savings the costs may be disproportionally high.


#Recommended Reading

###Books about investing

**[Intelligent Investor - Benjamin Graham](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Practical/dp/0060555661/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394958083)**

This book was written by the father of ""value investing"", and the mentor of Warren Buffett, who is widely accepted to be the world's most successful investor. 

It was originally published in 1948, but Ben Graham updated it periodically over the years, and it stands as true today as it ever has.

**[Beating the Street - Peter Lynch](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beating-Street-Peter-Lynch/dp/0671891634/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394958226)**

Published in 1994, this is arguably showing its age more than Intelligent Investor. Either way, valuable reading from one of the best managers of money in the past few decades.

**[Naked Trader - Robbie Burns](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Naked-Trader-anyone-trading-shares/dp/0857191705/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394958400)**

Subtitled ""How anyone can make money trading shares"", this is an entertaining, tongue-in-cheek account of one financial journalist's attempt to quit his job and make £1,000,000 using a short-to-medium term trading strategy. Not very scientific, but an interesting counterpoint to the previous recommendations.

**[Smarter Investing - Tim Hale](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Smarter-Investing-Simpler-Decisions-Financial/dp/0273785370/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394958561)**

The ultimate counterpoint to attempting to ""beat the markets"" - after spending 15 years working in active fund manager, Tim Hale concluded that the best outcomes for most investors in most situations would be a simple portfolio of ""passive"" investments (that is, funds which attempt to track a market, rather than outperform it). This style is favoured by the likes of Monevator, and many of the subscribers here.

**[Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder letters - Warren Buffett](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html)**

Not a book, but a series of essays over the years from the world's most successful investor. Makes interesting reading! Notably, the 2014 letter (not published in the above link but published [here in abridged form](http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2014/02/24/warren-buffett-berkshire-letter/)) implies that he now feels most investors would be best served by low-cost trackers.

**[The Financial Times guide to investing - Glen Arnold](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Financial-Times-Guide-Investing/dp/027372374X)**

A great starter guide, going from the very basics (why businesses need shareholders) to more in-depth explanations of different types of investment, and step-by-step guides on how to execute trades.

true,HeartyBeast,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; So you might need help understanding the odd word in Spanish, would you actually need the whole document translated into English for you?

Well, lets look at a typical paragraph from HMRC's tax guidance document that comes out with a self asessment form:

&gt;The amount of benefit on which you will pay tax is:
• for land and buildings – the annual open market rent you could obtain if you let the land (including buildings), less any rent you actually paid in
2013–14; for guidance read the Inheritance Tax Manual at IHTM44010
• for chattels – interest at the prescribed rate on the capital value of the
chattels, less any rent you actually paid in 2013–14, for guidance read theInheritance Tax Manual at IHTM44016

Yup, I think having that translated in its totality would be useful.

&gt;By the way, when you give in your tax form in English, who do you expect is going to read it? They will have to employ someone who can understand English,

Well, no. Actually the point is that the person filling it in does the work; the tax office just has to process a nice series of figures. If you do it online, no-one 'reads' it.

&gt; Why is it fair that taxpayers pay for that extra cost, who shouldn't you?

These days it's hard to appreciate just how much they hated communists, to the point of quite happily getting in bed with fascists. 

My argument is that appeasement wasn't necessarily the wrong path to take, when facing an unpredictable leader - especially one who had turned Germany around so comprehensively from the Weimar days. Hitler was a rising star in Europe whereas the UK was still pretty battered from the war and resistant to getting involved. The UK was quite happy to throw any number of European countries to the wolves provided that we avoided another war; if in the process we created a strong buffer against the soviets then even better.

The use of appeasement by politicians fails to take into account the situation at the time, as does any presentation of Chamberlain as a coward or a bungler. Hindsight is 20/20: at the time appeasement absolutely made sense, and even if it were the wrong call at that time, it doesn't mean it's the wrong call now with Putin.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;You learn a language by being engaged by a culture; if you fear people of that culture will be rude to you it probably makes it quite difficult to stump up the courage to start a conversation and learn a language.

If you are going to live in another country, you learn the language **before** you move there. Its as simple as that. If you come to a country and you have such a poor grasp of the language that you cannot read a simple council form then you have woefully under-prepared yourself for living here. It is your fault, not the fault of the rest of society. 

My friends from France spent months and months attending English class before they moved here, and they have no problem filling out forms in English. 

In order to legally move to this country you need to show you can communicate in English to an appropriate level, which would cover the ability to fill out forms. If after a few months living here you cannot fill out a form, it is because you have chosen not to practice theses skills, and not to maintain the level of language communication you had. It is your own fault, your own choice, and taxpayers should not have to cover the cost of that. 

To blame the native population of the UK for being too rude is idiotic, and a terrible excuse for not being able to speak English. 

&gt;You're doing literally everything you can to avoid acknowledging that maybe, just maybe people that don't speak English probably aren't the richest and the reason they haven't got any money is because their is a richer class of people directly benefiting from cheap labour.

So if we were to work out many people would die if the same ratio of deaths per person was maintained across the country it'd be:

Actual number of cyclist injured across the entire country: 109.

So I am failing to see why we should spend disproportionately on Londoners based on that alone.

He was born to a former music hall performer, went to a Grammar School (which later turned into a comp), left with just 3 O levels, later gained 3 more by correspondence course.  Got a job as a clerk with an insurance brokers but hated it and went to work for his dad's garden ornaments business.  He later studied banking via correspondence and got a job in the banking sector - which the rose fast through the ranks.   Doesn't even look like he has any A levels or a degree. 

Got voted in as an MP and rose through the conservative party, ended up winning an election outright, and now holds an hour of the Most Noble Order of the Garter - which is one of the highest royal honours you can get - for his help dealing with the affairs after Diana's death and being financial advisor to the princes. 

I'm not a conservative, but I find his rise from ""son of retired music hall performer"" to becoming Chancellor, Prime Minister and confidant of members of the Royal Family pretty impressive.

...

&gt;""See, that's the type of response I expected from a cyclist.""

You put me (and everyone else) in a box.  That's how.

&gt; But you got to admit regardless of your views on the subject, that £913 million is a lot of money just for cyclists.

You keep saying ""cyclists"" as if it's not just people on bikes.  Your mum, your nan, your little sister.  It's a sensible investment into the main UK city. 

It's not about ""cyclists"", it's about most urban joineries being under **3 miles**.  Which should not at all be encouraged to be done in a car.

Here are the figures from [Transport For London](http://www.tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/corporate/technical-note-14-who-travels-by-car-in-london.pdf).

http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2013/08/journeys-in-london-are-no-longer-and-no.html

&gt; 2/3rds of the journeys that Londoners make by car are under 5 km (3 miles) in length. Half of these car journeys are less than 3 km (2 miles) in length and a third of the total are under 2 km (1.25 miles) in length.

This is a common theme across the country.  Short journies are done by car.  It's time to stop that.  Cars should not be as welcome as they are in city centres.  My house mates, work mates, mother and father would cycle more, but they're scared.  I don't blame them.

£913 million is a **start** to improving roads.  No it's not a lot of money.  It's what's required.  As /u/scoutisimba put it:

&gt; Great, but not nearly ambitious enough in my view. That's £100 per Londoner however it is also over a 10 year period (not mentioned in the article). For reference the Dutch spend more than double this per head and they already have years worth of investment. Not just in Amsterdam either.

&gt; What I would really like to see is a spending level edging towards £30 per capita by 2020, across the entire country. Although £10 per head would still be vast improvement as we only spend ~£2 (countrywide) per head currently.

Remember, the more people that don't use a car, means less motor traffic jams.  It's a win win.

In my experience most such people have a basic level of English or a friend who can translate. We also have to consider people who have arrived as refugees and quickly pass through NAS accommodation and into 'normal' society. They have not had the opportunity to learn, nor have umpteen people fleeing domestic abuse, brought over here in arranged marriages and kept form society by abusive partners. More than most, these people need to engage with council services and lack, through no fault of their own, the ability to do so. 

I'd also make damn sure there's not over subscription on English language courses in an area where translation services are being curtailed. There were huge waiting lists for English courses in my neck of the woods a few years ago, not sure how it is now but I can't imagine it'll be much different given all the cuts. 

tl;dr - as with all money saving cuts, it's the most vulnerable who will suffer and that suffering costs more money elsewhere. A battered wife who can't advocate via translation costs a damn sight more down the line in NHS or police costs than if you get her sorted out in an afternoon with the housing/DV officers.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"&gt; If you are going to live in another country, you learn the language before you move there. Its as simple as that. If you come to a country and you have such a poor grasp of the language that you cannot read a simple council form then you have woefully under-prepared yourself for living here. It is your fault, not the fault of the rest of society.
&gt; 

You can only learn a language by engaging with people of that culture. Language and culture are inseparable things. If you're a cheap labourer who moved half way across the world its probably because you didn't have access to the best education systems or western television.
These people are doing the shitty jobs for fuck all money and you think they'll afford to pay for translators.

&gt;In order to legally move to this country you need to show you can communicate in English to an appropriate level, which would cover the ability to fill out forms.

This is great. Who's going to pay for all the cheap labourers to be proficient in English? Oh, the labourers themseleves that have no money? If this is the case there won't be a soul left to pay our pensions in our ageing society.
You want skilled labourers who are language proficient, fine, I agree everyone should have access to education. My point is just this:

*The people that benefit from cheap labour as a consequence of immigration should be the ones that pay for it* i.e. the wealthy that benefit every single day as a consequence of cheap labour.

Attacking the immigrants themselves is a fools errand that looks great in headlines designed to manipulate you into thinking that immigrants are a threat to your way of life.

&gt; My friends from France spent months and months attending English class before they moved here, and they have no problem filling out forms in English.

Probably because they could afford *a language class* books written in English and had enough time to engage in culture. This is the product of rather nice economic conditions. 

&gt; Why they are here is irrelevant

No it isn't, its entirely relevant. They are here, by and large, for economic reasons. We have an unequal society in which we are constantly told, through our propaganda mechanisms, needs to grow. Immigration allows growth because he keeps wages low. When wages are kept low capitalist make more money and inflation is kept low. This means that the assets of the wealthy increase in value. This means that the wealthy benefit, disproportionately from immigration.

If you can read English to a reasonable level I don't see why you would have a problem reading this. 

&gt;Well, no. Actually the point is that the person filling it in does the work; the tax office just has to process a nice series of figures. If you do it online, no-one 'reads' it.

We are not just talking about tax forms, but even in a self assessment or limited company tax form there are parts that need to be explained with words. 

&gt;Why's it fair? Because we live in a pluralist society where people who aren't necessarily English speakers are nonetheless asked to pay tax.

It is reasonable to expect everyone who lives in this country to be able to speak English to a reasonable level. If you don't want to learn, that's fine, but when your refusal to learn the language starts to cost other people money, it is fair that you foot the bill.

If a licensee reports an aggregate break-even deficit that exceeds the

i) It reports a positive trend in the annual break-even results (proving it has 
implemented a concrete strategy for future compliance); and 
ii) It proves that the aggregate break-even deficit is only due to the annual 
break-even deficit of the reporting period ending in 2012 which in turn is 
due to contracts with players undertaken prior to 1 June 2010 (for the 
avoidance of doubt, all renegotiations on contracts undertaken after such 
date would not be taken into account).

We know this, we experience this, and this is well known evidence. But governments, school boards, or our peers do not care. Even slogans like ""it get better"" ignore the fact that going to university will not magically make your life better if you can't enjoy it. 

Society completely ignores the mental impact of bullying/peer abuse has on the mental self and society is willing the pay the price daily in money and dead bodies instead of having the political will to solve it.

The same thing happens to Japan as we have a generation of hikikomori who will never completely integrate into society.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"&gt; So the millions of people who are suffering wage depression because of this cheap labour certainly shouldn't be paying. And yet they are, through their taxes.

The immigrants aren't to blame for the quality of life of British people.
The minister of this country is a millionaire who went to private school, as is the chancellor and the mayor of the largest city. 
Just about all political donations come from wealthy individuals (*UKIP are dreadful for this*).
Practically all lobbying is done by wealthy corporate investors.

Any UKIP supporter will tell you that the Tory's talk a hard line on immigrants whilst not actually doing anything.
This is because immigration does create problems for ordinary people (as would any mechanism designed to keep wages low), but they don't want to have to raise taxes on the wealthy in order to pay for it. In fact, they never ever will raise taxes.
As a consequence they need scape goats because their entire economic model - that which gives them wealth and power - would be under threat if you started to question it.

This country *is run by capitalists in the interest of capitalists*. If you want to solve the problems created by immigration you should demand that the capitalists pay for solutions. 
Blaming immigrants and making them pay won't do anything except raise tensions even more; furthermore they don't even have any money - so how can they pay?
There is no way that the business elite of this country will allow any path that changes from this strategy; if UKIP (or anyone else) had any chance of influencing immigration rates (for example) they would be corrupted or destroyed by the capitalist class in a snap of their fingers. 
Do you understand what I'm saying?

&gt; You can get very far with lessons in your own country before you move to your new country. You don't need to be an expert, but you should be able to fill out a form.

Yeah, but laws can't target individuals they can only target groups. And if we hamper immigration we cut growth - its bad for business - and they only shit down the train.
You can instigate this sort of policy all you like, but as long as the country is run by big business it will act in the interest of big business and than means cheap labour.

We will have poor immigrants as long as the rich wants cheap labour. It's either that or make ourselves poor just to satisfy our dislike of people that can't speak the language.",0,1409761566,null,0,false,0,ck83zbi,t3_2fcdyb,t1_ck83zbi,t1_ck83f8c,null,1427216654,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"bockers7 is comes across as talking nonsense in that he doesn't back anything up, but at the same time it's definitely not a great financial decision to buy a house that expensive if you might not want it in a year's time.

Even ignoring mortgages, solicitor's fees, estate agents and all that, he's going to be paying 7% stamp duty on it, so that's £330k just getting thrown straight out the window in tax, even if he can sell it on for what he paid for it. That's money Balotelli can afford to lose, sure, but if you're going to rent somewhere for 3 years instead then £330k would work out at £9000 a month which would still get you a [pretty swanky place](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-to-rent/property-32010966.html).

Plus if he *does* have £4.5m cash lying around and spends it on a house, then the money is locked up in property and he can't do anything else with it. Spending £330k on rent over three or four years and investing £4.5m into stocks, shares, company bonds, gilts, whatever, would almost certainly net him more money across the four years than putting £4.5m in the house and losing £330k in tax. 

Talk that it'll bankrupt him is complete hyperbole, but at the same time even if he's paying for the whole house cash-in-hand with no mortgage it's a pretty dumb financial decision just from stamp duty alone. You're only ever going to get good investment returns on property if you're buying long-term to live in or rent out, or buying a shithole to fix it up and resell - even if you don't directly lose money you could probably have made more investing elsewhere. Even without a mortgage, seven percent of stamp duty plus legal fees is more than enough to wipe out a natural rise in value over a couple of years unless it was undervalued to begin with.



Also your statement that ""The value of that house in not going to decrease, if anything it will go up."" is pretty baseless - house prices over the last few years have gone down across the UK except for in the south-east, and for a very minor general rise in the last 6 months or so.

In the fact the problems you cite, mostly come down to gerrymandered consistencies and first past the post. Now the latter you might escape in the hypothetical Scotland. However the former, well... to hand the SNP a minority government in a unicameral system.

*FULL ARTICLE COPIED BELOW*

HE REPORTS are as follows: QPR agreed a fee with Liverpool for Fabio Borini that is approximately ten million pounds. They offered him a salary in the vicinity of double his current money. This was rejected. Borini has said to QPR that it would take triple his money and, crucially, a clause which allows him to move for less than ten million pounds next summer for him to be interested in the move. Both those things.

Earlier in the window, after what I would argue was a moderately successful loan move, Sunderland made it clear they thought it successful enough to offer fourteen million pounds for Borini’s signature, yet Borini didn’t seem to entertain this offer.

Let’s accept the reports because it is these reports which have led to Borini getting down the banks.

In short, this seems clear – Fabio Borini doesn’t want to play for Queens Park Rangers. He’d do so if:

1. He got crazy money.
2. He could see how he could leave at the end of the season to then go and play for someone else.

Further, Fabio Borini doesn’t want to return to Sunderland. He went there last season. Did well. But perhaps he believes it to be a dead end. He’d have a case to think that. He did well, we can all agree he did well, their supporters were massive fans of his, he showed huge commitment and scored goals in big games but now, after that season, his only offers are Sunderland and QPR.

In terms of usual conversations about footballers, there’s a complexity here, perhaps an uncomfortable one. Fabio Borini clearly isn’t motivated solely by money but from reports we can accept we can see he would allow himself to be consoled by it for twelve months. He clearly sees QPR as nothing more than a stepping stone in his career and as a stepping stone he’d like to feel he can more easily step off as quickly as possible. If he was solely motivated by money then he accepts the highest bidder and goes.

There are other reports, other rumours. Borini is supposed to like Liverpool. He has a life here that he enjoys. He may well also think he can break into Liverpool’s set up. There are precedents for that. A long season beckons and Liverpool suddenly look a lot better playing two forwards and the third on the list, Lambert, looks short of the pace required to play in this Liverpool side. Other reports suggest he’d like to go back to Italy. Getting back to Italy when clubs in England will pay over ten million pounds for you is hard. Only five transfer fees over eight figures were paid in Italy this summer.

Borini has also never been settled – he’s 23 and he has played senior games for five different clubs. It wouldn’t be unlikely if he’d like his next move to be one he can properly get behind. A club to settle at. Sunderland was sold to him as a springboard and he doesn’t want QPR to become a prison. His next move could define his career. The next four year deal he signs takes him through to 27.

All this is very human. We are, as humans, motivated by a variety of factors in our career. We can, if given the opportunity, be motivated by material gain, by career progression, by location. Some of us don’t get that opportunity, we aren’t fortunate enough to be put in that position. But those of us who are trade off one motivation for another constantly. We may place money at the centre of our career, we may trade off short term gain for long term gain, we may choose location over salary or we may embark on a difficult path we believe to be eventually rewarding. There’s no definitive right answer. Everyone’s circumstances are different and different choices suit different people.

However, coverage and discussion of Borini is exceptionally negative. Borini gets slaughtered as greedy and/or delusional. His decision unfathomable. His demands unreasonable. People are “disappointed in him.” Disappointed in what exactly? That Liverpool Football Club didn’t receive fourteen million? Well they weren’t going to reduce the ticket prices using that money. (By the way, if they did it would be 14,000,000 / 19 / 45000 which is 16 quid off a game). That money isn’t getting taken from you. What are we disappointed in? That a young man chose to stay at a football club for the next four months. He would definitely play more for Sunderland or Queens Park Rangers than he will at Liverpool. We can all agree on that. But what happens next for him?

A lot of this is about what the gap between the top seven and the rest actually means. Wilfried Bony scored sixteen league goals last season. He’s a good player. He remains at Swansea City. Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea and Everton have all signed centre forwards, he has a release clause, yet he remains at Swansea City. How many league goals would he have to score to get a move? How many can he and Swansea City score? Swansea scored fifty four goals in the league last season – the most scored by a side outside the top seven. Bony contributed almost a third of them. If he wants to play for a bigger club – and possibly he doesn’t – what does he have to do? What is possible for him to do? His only option is to do it again.

Borini is at a top seven club – he’s at a top three club – and if he moves from this top seven club then when does he next get his chance? Maybe never? Probably never. So why throw it away for Queens Park Rangers? And if he does choose to throw it away why not ensure that he gets weighed in for it? If you are going to sell out your dreams, how much do you sell them for?

Lastly, then, the question becomes “should he accept his level is Sunderland?” Perhaps he should. They are one of this country’s great historic clubs with a marvellous fanbase. Perhaps he should accept the most he can be is a big fish at that sized pond. However it might be that he’d rather be any size fish back in a Serie A or La Liga sized pond but knows that a move to Sunderland or Queens Park Rangers without any clause allowing a reasonable, effective transfer fee sees him stuck in a location he doesn’t want to be in having simultaneously abandoned his ambition.


The real life financial existence of elite footballers is something we can’t really appreciate. Their lives are, in comparison to ours, gilded. They should never have to worry about money. Few of life’s luxuries should be out of reach for them. That doesn’t equal happiness though; don’t get me wrong, it can make happiness a hell of a lot easier, but it doesn’t mean they will always be happy in their work. We know enough about their lives to know that by now. Playing football is brilliant. I can only imagine being brilliant at playing football is brilliant squared. It being your job is brilliant cubed. But if you’ve made playing football your job the idea you should be entirely subject to its whims reduces you simply to that occupation and to exterior perceptions of it.

To say he’s rubbish, he’s delusional, he’s taking Liverpool for a ride is disrespectful, not simply to him as a footballer but to him as a human on a career path. It demeans him not to respect his decision to expect Liverpool to honour a contract they agreed with him and it demeans him further to reduce his life options to two job offers and call him greedy for not choosing to go to either despite both offering to double his money. The tone of the discussion around Borini reduces all parties – footballers, football journalists and football supporters to judgemental, money-obsessed, nosey parkers, when instead he’s being what he is – a 23 year old lad with a career choice. He might make the right one, he might make the wrong one. Let’s not rush to crucify over what’s a complicated situation. We say we want our footballers to be more human. Here Fabio Borini, semi-incomprehensible tweet and all, is in a very human situation. He isn’t lucky enough to be Falcao, few of us are in our chosen profession, so he has to get on with being Fabio Borini. It isn’t as easy as we make it out to be.",0,1409764165,null,0,false,0,ck85b0g,t3_2fdayi,t1_ck85b0g,t3_2fdayi,null,1427215783,15,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,15

Too often we just treat players as just, well, pieces of meat, trained monkeys out there to perform tasks, indentured servants to a club, and disposable when they become surplus to requirements and deemed 'not good enough' for the club. If they dare complain, then they are crucified because of the amount of money they are paid for performing a highly specialised task.

Fabio Borini is only 23-years-old and he has bounced around *a lot* and that could weigh on a lad just looking for a bit consistency in his professional career:

* 2009-11: Chelsea
* 2011: Swansea (loan)
* 2011-12: Parma
* 2011-12: Roma (loan)
* 2012- : Liverpool
* 2013-14: Sunderland (loan)

That's a lot of moving around, a lot of starting over, trying to make friends in a new city with new teammates, new managers, new clubs, etc.

Can you blame the guy for a little consistency? I can't.

Only a 'Godfather' - one he can't refuse - could probably push him to a place like Sunderland or QPR where the weight of his contract would make him the most expendable when they inevitably falter or try to fight off relegation. And then that's another move.

At Liverpool? He has a relatively long-term contract. He has a manager he knows in Brendan Rodgers from the Chelsea and Swansea days. He now has a fellow Italian friend in Mario Balotelli. He is on an incredibly exciting team on an upward trend. He eyes our striking situation and knows that Daniel Sturridge can sometimes have issues with fitness, he knows that Rickie Lambert only has a season or two of regular and consistent play.

Borini realises that if he continues to work hard, prove himself in Cup matches and in sub appearances, then next thing you know, he may emerge as a solid third striker for years to come.

Ultimately, I think just for business reasons on the LFC side of things, I wish Borini would have moved on. But I won't blame him at all for staying with the club.

true,bockers7,lfc99,,"I typed out a response and realized it was extremely long. So long I didn't even want to read it lol. But see below if it interests you, but you have been warned haha

Yeah, seriously.

For starters, 6 month salary isn't like a week worth of salary. For a footballer, 6 months is quite a long time if you compare it to their career. You might laugh, but footballers play until they're about 34-38 years old. Let's say he plays until he's 36. He started at 17. That's 19 years as a footballer. After some quick research which may totally be wrong, he's worth about USD 35m today. (big junk of it was the payment City had to give him for the Milan transfer I believe) He's only 24 now, so he has 12 more years at a career.  

Now here's the catch. Unfortunately for Balotelli, he has played in 4 clubs in 3 different cities in 5 years time. He has been hopping around without cementing himself in any real team for his whole career. Troubles have followed him and his value has taken quite a hit. He already dropped a lot in salary in order to come here. But now, what if he gets hurt this year? What if he destroys one of his knees? What if he wants to play in Spain? What if him and Sturridge hate each other? What if? If he's worth USD 35m and gets hurt, you are asking him to spend about 1/3 of his net worth on a home which he will definitely not make his permeant location for the long term. Let’s also add that he already owns a house in Milan. A USD 5m dollar home if I'm not mistaken. Worst case scenario he gets seriously injured.  Now he's hurt, paying bills for two luxury homes plus all of his other fancy toys, and will never get a new large contract again. His money from Liverpool will run out in however long the contract is. His Puma contract will end in the same fashion. What will he do? He will have to sell at least one of his villas. Which one? This one. 

Now comes the headache that comes with selling a home. Selling a house is not like selling lemonade at your corner stand. It could take months, especially if he wants to up the value after just one year. 

And I disagree with your view on renting. To me renting is not just throwing money away. It's hedging your risk. If you rent, you typically don't pay for a lot of the expenses that come with owning a home. For example, taxes, insurance, lawn care, maintenance/repairs, appraisal fees + closing costs which tends to be quite a bit. You sell a £4,750,000 home? 3-4% goes to the broker (£142,500-£190,000). If he rented this place he would spend about £19,000-£26,000 mnth (15-20 years tends to be how long it takes to make back your investment on a rental property). Now £22,500 (halfway between £19k-£26k) would give you 6 months of living without having to spend a single dime on all the above costs I mentioned compared to JUST the LOW closing cost (£142k) he would have to pay if he sells the house. If it’s the high £190k, he could live there for 8.5 months. And I don’t believe the house will go up in value by a large amount after a single year. And yes, you can say, what about the remaining 4-5 mnths he would still spend on rent?  Well that’s the hedge I’m talking about. For 1 WEEK’S INCOME, he can live in that house for 5 months (5 mnths = £112.5; believe he is on at £110k). Do you see what I’m talking about here? And he wouldn’t have to pay taxes or insurance or all of that other jazz which would probably be pretty big figure. It’s a no brainer for the first year of being at a new club. 

Also, the house you own, in my opinion, is not an asset. It does not make you money but it does cost you a lot of it. The home you live in is a liability. Look for costs above for reference. If you sell your house, you will have to buy another one. Could you make money on it? Sure you can, but you will always need a roof over your head. Real Estate other than your primary residence are assets. That's just the school of thought I believe in. And that's why I stated the above. There are others who think it is in fact an asset, but I don't agree with it. You can argue that it's a long term asset, but in this case you can't use that argument bc we're discussing Balotelli's situation which is short term. 

Lastly, I can almost guarantee you that he does not buy a home in the first 12 months. He has already experienced moving around and only an idiot would buy a house right away. I guess we will wait and see but I have a pretty big hunch that I'm correct.

Edit: But you're right. I'm not an expert and there is a lot I missed. It's just what I have come to believe after paying attention a bit to the realestate market. See U/Rosti_LFC response below. He mentions quite a bit I didn't even think of. Also would like to add that I'm 100% pro Balotelli and I believe he will do great for us. But if I was him I wouldn't buy just yet.

true,eckingbottom,null,null,"It's a somewhat facile statement for a number of reasons. 

1) The Conservative government has already stated that it wants councils to stop translating documents for everything a number of years ago.

2) All public authorities are subject to the Public Sector Equality Duty under the Equality Act 2010 which means they need to evidence due regard to advancing equality of opportunity,  removing discrimination and fostering good relations between communities. Therefore to meet their legal duties they will have to make a language based interventions and provide interpretation and translation services to ward off the threat of legal challenge. 

3) It's not cost effective to not provide translation services in many instances. Not properly informing people of changes to services means that they'll become more costly. Bins won't go out correctly,  people won't seek out correct social care interventions early enough or won't understand how to pay their council tax for example. This means public services foot the bill for tidying up messes, people end up unnecessarily in expensive critical care or council's chase debtors at a higher cost.

4) Most public authorities have slashed budgets for this anyway and implement more creative policies such as using online translation, using pictorial information or engaging with local community and voluntary sector groups to disseminate messages.

5) Proportionality is used in most cases these days. Councils monitor the number of requests for information in lots of different languages and balance out the most cost effective approach. If there's few requests they'll use services such as language line to deal with a 5 minute conversation.  If there are 100s of requests then forking out a few hundred pounds to have something translated is a more proportionate response.

There are many sensible ways to encourage people to learn English. Making it difficult for them to access public services is not one of them. ",0,1409765220,null,0,false,0,ck85tzf,t3_2fcdyb,t1_ck85tzf,t3_2fcdyb,null,1427215478,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

That is my point you linked to a site, I am talking about Sourced links from yourself, like saying Quran 1:1 and linking to the verse that you have allegedly read from the Quran.

&gt;Well, you did ask me for evidence. 

I asked evidence from your reading, when you linked me to the website it seemed you have made no constructive criticism instead me the opponent of your argument am arguing against a wall. Also you showed no evidence that you agree with them a simple googling and a copy and past anyone can do that.

Example: Arguer A hates Germany Arguer B persuades Arguer A that Germany is not to be hated, Arguer A Googles ""I hate Germany"" then copy pastes the work of other people who hate Germany and give it to Arguer B http://compendium.travelvice.com/reasons-to-hate-germany/

And leaves for Arguer B to argue with that website's claim.

Instead Arguer B would expect some constructive criticism, for example Arguer A hating on German customs of spitting on trees that he has witnessed, or Germans lack of humour when he joked around in Germany.

You need to show you know what you are talking about.

&gt;It's irrelevant what my frame of mind is. 

It is relevant because it shows if you already had a pre-disposed hatred towards Islam or you had no hatred and tried to go in with clean rational mind. Basically your opinions are shaped by others not by you.

Example do you hate the Country Nauru officially known as Republic of Nauru an island country in Micronesia in the South Pacific just northeast of Australia. One with an open mind would have no hatred of a subject like this country because he doesn't anything about it excluding external factors that maybe be biased like Nauru having children behind bars

Basically, they turn up to their depot in the morning in their van, see if there's any packages, and they're paid based on how many packages they chose to agree to delivery

The implications of this are that as soon as it's left the depot, it's in the hands of some random person who can do with the package as they will. 

AFAIK, DPD actually employ their drivers, they are provided with a van, and a load of packages, a route with which to deliver those packages, and specified time constraints. Because they're employed, if the driver messes up, they can actually do something about it, as they own all the equipment and effectively the driver.

Google Yodel though, they are notoriously incompetent.

However, I'm obviously happy to abide by the rules of the site, and as I'm sure you know, there are other ways of following the site if you enjoy the posts (Facebook, Twitter etc).

&gt;

&gt;__John White__ (born 1950) is a former leading [loyalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_loyalism) in [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland). He was sometimes known by the nickname 'Coco'.  White was a leading figure in the loyalist paramilitary [Ulster Defence Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Defence_Association) (UDA) and, following a prison sentence for murder, entered politics as a central figure in the [Ulster Democratic Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Democratic_Party) (UDP). Always a close ally of [Johnny Adair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Adair), White was run out of Northern Ireland when Adair fell from grace and is no longer involved in loyalism.

Absolutely, and that's one of the reasons I wanted to share this. It's a perceptive article, though it deals with an issue in which both sides have a good case. Yes, Pochetino was a bit naive to think that the same squad that lined up against QPR would do against Liverpool, two teams as far apart in terms of quality as the League offers. But, it's also easy to understand why he'd go with the same lineup: you want to build continuity and stability, and reward players who have done everything asked of them to this point.

1 - Henderson is a typical box to box-midfielder. In a heavy possession game versus a side lying low, like this game, how effective is that kind of player? I can see that him making runs through the Norwegian defense that creates space, but would a playmaker like Gerrard (for instance) be more effective given the lack of a need for defensive runs in this game?

2 - What does Rooney do exactly? He pressures the defense on the ball but to be honest he's never really impressed me. What makes him so good?

3 - Sterling moves inside a lot, which opens up space on his side of the pitch. Chamberlain stays much wider, which seems to do very little. Would it be better to play a right winger that moves inside as well? And if not, does that have anything to do with Stones being a less effective wing-back than Baines?

Given the lack of response from the council and police, I'm willing to bet he's probably right.

I get that a lot of taxi drivers hate Delta for ""stealing"" business, but frankly I think it's just business. It's literally half the cost to get a Delta as it is to get a Hackney. Often the price of a Delta is where the bloody meter starts in the hackneys. 

If Delta can operate so cheaply and if delta can have so many drivers on staff, it must be doable.

You can either do 10 or 20 credit modules in my course - 10 are less contact hours and generally a lot simpler whereas 20 credit ones go into a lot more detail and therefore have much harder (albeit less) exams.

I'd advise taking modules that synergise quite nicely, for example I did three on different aspects of a very similar topic (pest control, parasitology, crop disease). It makes the exams easier plus gives you a better knowledge of what it is you're interested in. 

You should definitely go over your lecture notes and learn it all during the year though when you have a ton of free time instead of trying to cram everything at the end. ",0,1409773136,null,0,false,0,ck89w5r,t3_2f5qhm,t1_ck89w5r,t1_ck88tfe,null,1427213012,2,false,leedsuniversity,t5_2v2sx,2
