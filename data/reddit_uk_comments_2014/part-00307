false,TechJesus,null,null,"&gt; However, in the UK in particular when compared to other countries, we have a political system that polarises people around one of two extremes and which doesn't allow for any nuanced conversation. Politics has two parties (Sorry Lib Dems but it does), papers take one of two sides and normal avenues for political activity you find in other countries like strong local government are so weak in the UK that they are essentially governed by the national level politics. Not one person in 50 here would votes for a Labour/Tory local councillor if they were a Tory/Labour supporter even if they had good ideas that could help out locally. 

Pretty poor analysis of the situation, imo. Unlike the States the problem here is not partisanship, but a lack of choice between the two parties. The difference between the opposing front benches has collapsed since Tony Blair was elected leader of the Labour party, and it is the front benches that dictate policy. As for Tory and Labour supporters, they are few and far between, as evinced by the collapse in party membership. This is again due to the fact that the leadership of the parties controls everything – another Blair trick inherited from Thatcher.

&gt; A classic example of this was the panic in this country over having a coalition government because it would make the government ""weak"" - that view was in nearly every paper and even reflected in the financial markets but think what that actually means, a government trying to respect the views of the majority of the voting population for the first time in my lifetime is ""weak""! 

This was based on this country's previous experience of coalition, which was far less stable than this government has been. As it happened it was the Lib Dem economically liberal Orange Book crowd which hopped in bed with the Tories, which under Cameron's leadership have erged more towards the socially liberal side of things (see gay marriage). The real differences between Clegg and Cameron's respective cliques is how to spread the pain, with Clegg favouring pain for the rich, while Cameron favours pain for the poor. Were they to split off from their respective parties the platform would be pretty coherent. 

One of Ukip's major contributions has been to push the two main parties further away from one another. It will be nice to have a proper two party system again.",0,1413440228,null,0,false,0,clavnpc,t3_2jayfz,t1_clavnpc,t1_cla1i27,null,1426504177,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I think it's quite unfair to place the blame solely at the governments doorstep, when it is quite clear that other things were going on in the rest of the world (recession in the eurozone, collapse of american banks, recession in the USA, stagnation in Japan, slowing growth in China). Considering that Labour left the economy growing from late 2009 until 2010, I don't think it's fair to say they wrecked the economy.

I'm afraid I have no idea about your third point! But the Labour party has moved so far to the right in terms of its policy approach, that I would guess a 70s Labour government would have a very different approach to a 97-2010 government. I think the same goes probably applies to final couple of points you make. The Labour party of today is very very different from that of the 50s and 60s.

- Both Brown and Solanke look really comfortable in front of the goal, but I expect Bamford to get the chance as our third option first, probably next season - when Drogba retires.

- Lewis Baker and Ruben Loftus - Cheek are the kind of players that aren't really available on the market, and I think that one of them will certainly develop in a first team player - Baker will probably get chance next season.

- The thing I'm confused with is Christensen who is member of the first team second season in a row, but hasn't got a chance yet. I think the plan is for him to work closely with Terry, so he will jump in when John retires.

- Ake looks promising on DM position, and with his versatility I can see him getting his chances this season. Playing either DL, DC, or DM.

- Ones that don't make it in the team will probably make it elsewhere: Take a look at Tore (Bešiktaš), Cork (Southampton), Bruma (PSV), van Aanholt (Sunderland), Mancienne (HSV to Ntm Forest), Bridcutt (Sunderland), de Bruyne (Wolfsburg), Lukaku (Everton) and basically that's not a bad thing, to have a bunch of good team players around the league that Chelsea produced.

So I'll say again, for the 3rd time, but spelling out the context for you.

In the context of quality of goods received, ordering off Amazon Marketplace is the same as ordering off eBay - Amazon/eBay have no control, contact or interaction with the actual product sent out. Can you refute that? That was my first and initial point.

My second point that I added (again, in response to you taking my first point out of context) was regarding refunds - refunds with eBay and Amazon Marketplace are practically the same - you're expected to deal with the seller first, and if all else fails, eBay/Amazon will step in. Sure, you can say ""well someone in Amazon said they'll always refund"" but if you look at the eBay Money Back Guarantee, that says exactly the same - they'll always refund. This reinforced my second point that refunds on Amazon Marketplace are handled in practically the same way as eBay (contact seller, if that fails, refund off Amazon/eBay). Can you refute that? 

I'm sorry, but you've taken my points out of context, and then used out of context points to make quite harsh comments and accusations of spreading FUD. I don't really appreciate that. Now I get the feeling you're backtracking and trying to save face by making it out that I'm wrong. Fact is, if you take all my comments in the context presented, I've not actually said anything factually inaccurate.

So just use common sense when it comes to any sort of electronic information. The point of spoofing numbers is to mask your real number and to instil confidence in order to steal information. But no legitimate company will call and ask for personal information out of the blue without being able to verify themselves properly.

In a few occasions I've had calls from banks, credit card companies and the like. To be safe I've asked if I could call them back - checked the actual customer service number for the company and called that, asking for the person who called. If you ask to do this and they get funny about it, hang up, it wasn't legitimate.   

Most when calling with only check a minor detail from you (such as postcode) then offer information that only they would have (such as the last 4 digits of your card number) so you can be happy that it's legitimate. If they call and ask for your full bank details then it's going to be a scam. If you're still not happy then ask for their name and call them back, simple

I train at a place called 'the gym group' on westover road. It's £12.99 a month and would take you ten minutes to reach by bike (assuming you do move to charminster.) There are loads of treadmills, rowers, ellipticals etc.. It has a semi decent free weights area which can get very busy at peak times. They often have classes on - I think you'll find they're quite cheap and the staff seem cool.


There's two other very similar gyms, closer to charminster - one being fitspace, below the asda superstore. The other is pure gym which is right in the town centre. I can't say much about then as I've not been in to either but they cater to the same crowd as the gym group. Expect them to be v busy after working hours.

If you want something more luxurious, you'd be looking at 'the village' which is in castle lane near bmth hospital. They have a smallish gym in terms of machines and weights, but loads of room for classes and whatnot. There's also a big swimming pool, sauna, spa and steam room- the facilities are good but it'll cost you about £50 a month. 


The middle ground is fitness first - there's one basically 2 minutes from charminster which has similar facilities to the village. I'd say I actually prefer their equipment and weights area - there's also a pool and a sauna but they're not quite as nice as the village. Heaps of classes on there though if that's your thing.

Hope that helps you make a decision!

false,KapteeniJ,null,null,"I honestly don't care about the role of the companion. It's all about the Doctor, and there are multiple ways and styles the Doctor can be focus of the show.

The main point of companions has remained the same: They're supposed to be stupid and ask a lot of questions, which in turn makes Doctor seem like very smart and charismatic. Fans like seeing Doctor be smart and charismatic, so this role is essential, and has not changed. This is pretty universal, many TV shows and fiction in general has characters that similarly exist to support the main character, make them look better than they actually are. In Doctor Who this role however is codified into the word ""companion"".

But outside of that main role, companions also serve smaller roles. They are always representations of the best of the humanity, serving as a foil to the alien nature of the Doctor. Doctor is occasionally blind to moral aspects of things, and occasionally his decisions depend on what's the best humanity can do. Companion is the one that represents that. It's been highlighted a couple of times, mostly during time Amy was the companion.

In case of Clara, I thought that they were going for Peter Pan style of disillusionment. After Orient Express episode, I'm however kinda struggling to see where they are going. My original theory was that Clara was going to undergo similar fate as Pond did, where they need to start living in the ordinary world instead of chasing after these fantastic worlds with the Doctor.

Which would've been kinda consistent with Moffat. He does like to portray companions as stable ones, while the Doctor is kinda ADHD type, unable to live in one place or time, deriving tension from this difference.

false,Cainedbutable,eng-buckinhamshire,Buckinghamshire,"I love this review for it on Amazon:

&gt;My last two umbrellas have ended their days after being blown inside out and being irretrievably damaged in the process. Enter centre stage the Fulton Stormshield. This is a battleship of an umbrella: a Forth Bridge of an umbrella: an umbrella that Brunel would have been proud of. It laughs at the wind's feeble attempts to attack it: it sheds rain with contempt. One day, all umbrellas will be built like this. Just two downsides: it is relatively heavy for an umbrella and, because of its Gargantuan canopy, it needs a strong arm to hold on to it when the wind is strong. Make no mistakes; this is the stormproof umbrella that you've dreamed of, but it won't fit into your bag and you'll know that you're carrying it. For staying dry when you're out in the raging storm, it has no equal.

&gt;Its now 19 months since I bought my Stormshield and I have to report that my admiration for it is undiminished. If anything, I now hold it in even greater esteem! I have used it in 'Amber Alert' winds and, although it has often been difficult to hang on to, it hasn't let me down. On at least 3 occasions I was expecting it to fail but, with a fairly loud 'pop!', the vent between the canopies opened to release the pressure and the day was saved! As a former scientist, now retired, and with no connection to Fulton (although I have owned one of their collapsible umbrellas which served me well on Pyrenean hikes), it is my considered opinion that the Stormshield is brilliant. I can report a few hiccups: the little Velcro patch that retains one of the straps is coming un-stitched and it has closed on me twice, although maybe I hadn't operated the top catch completely. If someone had said to me that they could guarantee to keep me dry through the worst of storms for 19-plus months for £20-odd, I'd have made the deal with no hesitation.

I agree so why haven't bothered to do anything about it yet. It's only now that UKIP have started to gain some ground that the Conservatives are having to shift their policies in reaction. It's no coincidence and obviously a knee jerk reaction to UKIP and UKIP alone. If UKIP weren't making so much ground on immigration then I'm pretty sure the rest of the parties would continue to ignore this issue.

&gt;I don't see where you have got this from? There's a difference between an immigrant who is already here and an immigrant who isn't yet.

I am considering options that would appease the electorate and there are none short of going full retard.

We can't stop EU citizens coming here without pulling out of Europe. We can't tell the ones already here to leave. The only thing we can do is tighten up existing immigration controls for non-eu citizens which is already a tough enough process anyway so the net change with any of these changes? Almost fuck all.

Cyclists feel obliged to cycle aggressively and at speed because anything else will earn them the ire of drivers. 

Cycling in the UK is fast and most regular cyclists use sport-specific clothing. In countries like the Netherlands and Denmark, cyclists are dressed more or less just like everyone else, because the infrastructure and culture of the country makes it easy for them to do so.

The mayor's office has previous for this, too.

In 2012, Boris claimed [2/3rds of crashes involving cyclists were the fault of the cyclist](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2012/may/25/cycling-governed-dimwits). When pressed for a source of these figures, he admitted 'A member of the public had told him'

The UKIP person makes it very clear in his complaint that the damage to the phone was limited to the case. He even repeats it.

The statements from both sides make it clear that he only got his phone out after three people were filming him and yelling at him.

The article is mistaken about what constitutes (common) assault. I doesn't matter if his arm was just 'brushed' (have extreme difficulty believing this anyway ) or if the phone was forcefully snatched.

At the heart of it is a neutral, humanitarian issue.

And by keeping interview notes, records etc they can ensure that if a tribunal comes around they can point to these notes and say: ""It clearly shows here why we didn't think person x was the best person for the job. So we offered it to person y, who was.""

There is a common sense issue, such as hiring a wheelchair bound person on a building site, but considering that most disabled people have enough common sense to know what they are capable of it needn't necessarily be a problem.

Finally, the concept of a minimum wage is not necessarily fair, but it is fairer than what came before.

If you had to pay £44,000 to enter university I would be completely against it. But that's not the way it works. Repaying your student loan works like income tax, so the more you earn, the more you pay into the system.

I left university around 8 years ago and still have a massive loan to repay, but because university has lead to me earning more money, it seems fairer that I pay it than expect people who didn't even go to University to pay it. The repayments are manageable and it works like a slight increase in my income tax.

------------------------

**Raheem on fitness**  
'I’m always active, always working out, so you do get an athlete's body. I'm a bit skinny at the moment so I'm working on that, not too much [muscle], as I don't want to be too top heavy. I'll be in the gym working, trying to get internally stronger.  
'I try to not lift too many weights. The people at the club [Liverpool] have been trying to get me to do core as much as possible - that's been a big factor for me so I try to do that at least a couple of times a week.  
'I have the odd day where I do work on upper body and stuff like that and try to get myself stronger and fitter. There are specialists at the club who are always working on this stuff with you, and are always working on all these ways to improve, and how to get to the next level. That's one of the steps that I'm taking - at this moment in time, I'm just trying to work hard in the gym, and on the pitch as well, to try to get as better as possible.' 

--------------------------------------------
 
**Raheem on England**  
'I think everyone in the England team can play. We've been unlucky in certain games and tournaments but I do see a bright future for England.'  

--------------------------------------------

**Raheem on his skills**  
'I do keepy-uppies literally every day on the training field but I don't do as many skills as I used to do when I was younger. I used to have 10 yards of space and no-one around me and used to do six or seven stepovers, but there's no point if you're not putting the ball in the back of the net.  
'You've got to realise that if you do little tricks, you're going to get kicked in the Premier League. You've got to really know how to pass and keep the ball moving without getting caught and getting silly injuries.'

--------------------------------------------

**Raheem on footballers unfairly getting stick**  
'I don't think some people realise the journey that some footballers have come on. Most people have started aged 7, 8, 9 or 10 and some make it to the last important step and some don't, so it's really [a] make or break [situation] initially that we're in.  
'We work for it from a young age and people don't see it until we're in the public eye, so they're probably just thinking that we're born into playing football really, but it's a journey we've come on.  
'We do put hours in off the field as well and try to give back as much as possible as we do on the field.'  

--------------------------------------------

**Raheem on his friendship with Jamaican sprint stars**  
'He's [Warren Weir] a good friend of mine and when I go to Jamaica, I try to see him or Usain as much as possible. If we're not out together, we're just having a laugh.'
Would he ever take on his friends on the track? ""No, no! That's something I wouldn't fancy doing really - that's why they're in the sport they're in really, because they're the best at what they do.'  
'I haven't had a chance to get a kickabout with them yet, but I heard Usain thinks he's a big player,' he says in response to Bolt's claims that he'd like to play for Man United. 'Yeah, I've heard that quite a few times.' 

-------------------------------------------- 

**Raheem on ignoring the hype**  
'It's nice to hear the things people say but I don't really take it in too much. I just try to block it out and concentrate purely on football, to improve and try to make people talk even more.'

--------------------------------------------

**Raheem on his unique running style**

Of course Sked is not a neutral source. However, the fact that Farage hasn't sued for libel is interesting in itself.

[This article](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/oct/13/race.world) makes that claim, and it predates Sked's claim by several years.

No, I didn't mean to imply it was full of swindlers, I'm simply stating that due to there being multiple providers on Marketplace, there's inevitably going to be less consistency than when ordering off a single retailer (Amazon). This is a relevant comment and question in the context of OP. I could see how, if you were to ignore the context set out by OP, you could infer that as ""warning people away from Amazon marketplace"" - if you want to take replies to a post out of the context of that post, then that's your issue.

Even the ""fulfilled by Amazon"" listings, they don't open or check the products. In fact, the don't even track specific instances of products, only barcodes. This leads to the situation where a retailer in e.g. America ships a product to a US warehouse, a retailer in China ships the same product to an EU warehouse, but when an EU customer orders the product from the American retailer, they actually get the product the the EU warehouse from the Chinese retailers. People have complained about this in the past. This illustrates that Amazon have no control, contact or interaction *relevant to the quality of the products* ordered from Amazon Marketplace.

Again, the things I have stated have all been accurate when taken in the context of the rest of the original post. 

You picked up on my statement ""ordering from eBay - you're at the mercy of the seller, not eBay."" I didn't literally mean ""at the mercy of the seller"" in all senses (contexts) of the word: the seller doesn't literally have your life in his control. So the logical context in which to interpret the statement would be in the context set out by OP (given it was a reply to OP). But you didn't do that. You instead made up your own context relating to returns and after market services. OP stated he had no issue with after market services, purely the products being sent out - over which Amazon have no control - which is context in which I framed my response.

false,RandomHigh,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"I think it would help more if councils enforced the terms when people use the right to buy scheme.

If you sell the house within the first 10 years, you have to offer it back to the council first, or another social housing landlord in the area.

https://www.gov.uk/right-to-buy-buying-your-council-home/selling-your-home

I think the local councils should also extend the above to 15 years, with having to pay back the full discount if you sell within the first 10 years.

&gt; You’ll have to pay back some or all of the discount you got if you sell your Right to Buy home within 5 years of buying it.

Having to pay back the discount with the first 10 years would massively discourage those who buy a property at a discount to sell at the earliest available opportunity.

As it stands, you can buy up a property at a nice discount and sell it in 4 years time and only have to pay back 20% of that discount. This 20% will often be easily covered by the profit you got from the previous 80% off and any inflation that upped the price over the 4 years.

The right to buy scheme was supposed to help the poor get on the property ladder and reduce expenses for local councils. What it has achieved is people selling out as quickly as possible to large companies, and a shortage of homes in the area forcing up property prices for everyone.

A perfect example of this is the housing situation in London where large investment companies are buying up properties and not even renting them out. They're simply holding on to properties and pushing up housing prices by creating a lack of supply. They're essentially treating homes as stocks; artificially inflating the prices by buying up as many as possible.",0,1413462126,null,0,false,0,clb02mp,t3_2jep43,t1_clb02mp,t1_clazwh0,null,1426502084,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

What strain? Study after study has shown that immigration generates jobs for locals, and does not generally depress wages, even for the very low paid.

Immigrants are far more likely to pay tax, and far less likely to be on benefits than locals. Furthermore, they tend to be young and fit, so they use far less than their ""fair share"" of resources such as the NHS.

The biggest threat to social cohesion in the UK is the rise of racist nationalists, egged on by UKIP.

So rather than being something you can apply for, interview, etc. they'll become something you get through connections. 

So there's a very real possibility that legislation might make things worse.

&gt; We have seen over the last few years a notable rise in victims coming forward to report historical offences.

&gt; But this recent set of figures shows quite a change in that pattern, with 73% of the rise due to current offences.

&gt; So victims are coming forward now to report recent occurrences rather than historical ones and it's certainly the case the police are taking action to improve their recording and handling of rape investigations.

A large chunk of the rise is due to current, not historical events. The titles, headlines etc. are still misleading as the statistic is *reported* rapes increase by 29%. Rape reporting and recording (by the police) rates have been fairly steady over the last few years (from what I remember).

However, a 29% could still be within normal annual fluctuations (there aren't that many recorded rapes to start with, with a large population). If the increase is statistically significant this may be due to an increase in actual rapes, or the result of greater reporting; perhaps due to the Government's campaigns to spread awareness of what rape is and encourage reporting, or due to the high profile cases over the last year or two, or due to changes in police procedures for handling rape cases.",0,1413463529,null,0,false,0,clb0hqt,t3_2jeohj,t1_clb0hqt,t1_claz8l2,null,1426501888,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

NI would be equivalent to two average sized Belgian regions, or one larger one.

Also, Brussels aside (where, in practise, francophones dominate although Dutch has equal status and it's geographically in Flanders) it's split into two distinct national communities with very little overlap. 

Then we have the problem of forming governments. I spent the summer of 2007 in Belgium, and they had an election not long after I arrived, and they didn't form a government until the Christmas holidays. The same thing happened again a couple of years ago, and will happen when this government inevitably collapses.

The only reason the country even functions is because so many powers are devolved to the regions/communities and someone in the federal civil service just signs the cheques.

I have a friend with autism. She has struggled to maintain a job her whole life. Here parents moved abroad a couple of years ago leaving here here without any support. She rely on the government, and kindness from the people around her to get by. She has some experience working as a teaching assistant, but is never kept on for more than a few months, because her condition makes makes it a lot harder for her to do her job.
I feel very sorry for her, because I know she will be struggling her whole life. At the moment the thing she needs most is to work, to get experience in her job.

But I also understand from an employers perspective, that there is not much incentive to take her on. She will not perform as well as others, which makes things harder for everyone working there.

Giving employers an incentive to take people like her on will increase the quality of life of thousands of people with disabilities.
The alternative is that these people will either remain unemployed, or funnelled into ""suitable"" employment for them, which will almost always be incredibly unappealing and unsatisfying jobs.

It isn't even a plan, its not something you can easily measure its just some vague reactionary notion.
Furthermore, when you say this you mean good working practice and ethics; this (believe it or not) requires training and supervision.

I've not worked in healthcare, but I've worked in clinical trials and good clinical practice is more than just personal integrity; its man hours devoted to teaching people what is and isn't acceptable behaviour.

The P2P industry unilaterally agreed not to engage with the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Just because they're not regulated by the FCA doesn't mean it's any safer. 

You could still experience a total loss due to fraud or the failing of the provider and have no recourse to compensation from the FSCS. 

There are no sources to back up any statements, there are no risk warnings or objective consideration of the potential pitfalls of P2P lending.

The fact remains that he could, theoretically, organize his own party, which a lot of people (esp young people who could be a huge voting block if they organized) would flock to it if it had good solid ideas and policies. That is a revolution I could, and would, get behind.

false,[deleted],null,null,"I see no problem in small business or small time land lords fulfilling the renter market, however when rented property begins to out price 1st time buyers then it is a problem its even worse in areas of England where financial institutes invest in residential property and are happy to leave them empty as portfolio capital. You have people forced to rent who would otherwise like to buy.

A simple solution to this problem would be to put council tax liability squarely on the owner of property &amp; not the tenants. For each subsequent property owned the rate would double ect forcing property hoarders to sell and crash the price market down to sensible levels.

I live in Aberdeen where there is a housing shortage and shockingly a large amount of empty residential property, the council should tax unused property at 10,000 percent rates forcing owners to either sell or force them into such debt quickly that they can remove the property for failed council tax payment and turn it into social housing or place on the local market to raise council coffers. This strategy would work well and allow councils to pretty much nationalise or gain revenue from swathes of housing that is otherwise not being used or currently has over priced rent rates.

Housing benefit should be scrapped along with these changes, housing benefit does nothing but rob from the tax payer and give to the rich using the poor as some sort of unexplained excuse in the middle, it artificiality balloons rent rates where it is found &amp; social housing should be used instead.

Another quick fix would be to lower squatter ownership down to 1 year or 6 months, anyone should be able to claim an empty property as their own and if it is not disputed within 1 year then the deed can be transferred, this would remove property from people so well off and greedy they literally did not even realise they owned said building which is much more common than you might think.",0,1413472322,null,0,1413472851,0,clb47yo,t3_2jep43,t1_clb47yo,t3_2jep43,null,1426500077,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

These guys are heading out there from just about every part of the world - all over Europe, North america, Australia, and obviously the Middle East.

What do these men and women from all over the globe have in common? What is the battle cry they are rallying around? The answer is obvious, and it's not to be found in the varied and diverse societies they come from, it's the shared religious belief.

Yeah this is what this is all really about isn't it, poke hard enough and you always get to the inner reactionary core.

Complete and utter bullshit, soldiers and the police have been protected by the establishment for fucking decades.

When people study for careers there are basically three interested parties; the individual who will get skilled and earn more money/have access to more satisfying work, the companies that require those workers, and finally the state itself - which relies on professional jobs to run just about every single service that makes it an effective state.

Now under current arrangements the individual pays the lions share, the state provides some support... the missing link are the companies. They don't seem to be providing the same kind of corporate scholarships/sponsorships that they do in the USA and then on top of that, have managed to contort the financial crisis into making ""unpaid internships"" the norm. Businesses need graduates and they need to start paying for them... not just in salary but in educational costs to.

Probably the only way to put an end to it is to introduce a ban (or start enforcing existing legislation) to prevent this sort of extortion. It strikes me that anyone doing these shouldn't be doing them for more than 6-12 weeks (else it ceases to be an internship and you become a cog in someones operation), they should also be strictly prohibited from ""operational"" aspects of a business, so this would include everything from regularly making tea and coffee to things like data entry. These are jobs a person ought to be paid for and isn't really ""an internship"" in so much as they're just providing free labour. There should also be rules that stipulate companies either offer the internships with a contractual period of work afterwards (regardless of performance) or are completely prohibited from using misleading allusions like *""will likely lead to a full time job after the internship""*, since these are often used to hook people into &gt;1 year of unpaid work.

If you will earn £15,700 this year, you will pay tax on the £5,700 at a rate of 20%. (which is £1140).

The amount of tax payable is spread across the year (12 months) meaning you will pay around £95 a month in income tax. Your National Insurance Contributions, and any student loan on PAYE pension contributions will also increase due to the high wage.

But that said, I believe there is a deadline at HMRC for submitting information from employers to calculate any PAYE tax amounts. If the deadline has been missed by your employer, HMRC will assume your full £22k salary for the calculation. (meaning £200 a month in income tax).

Worse case - you will pay around £200 in income tax
Best case - around £100

You may find your tax code different this month, then next. But http://www.listentotaxman.com/ will give you some basic information about how much you should expect to pay.

So out of those that turned up Europe wide, it's certainly a majority in favour; and for about half of those that turned up to the UK EU election were in favour of the EU (voting Liberal, Labour, Green ect), a quarter in favour of leaving (UKIP) and another quarter who're kind of in the middle (ConservativeS). 

Although there was a slight distortion in that the Lib Dems managed to be hugely unrepresented even under a proportional system like the one used in the EU election. They got 1,000,000 votes but only one MEP, compared with UKIP who got four t' five times the vote (4.7m) but instead got 24 MEPs. The Liberals should have got about 5 or 6, but instead got one because they're hugely unrepresented due to their large support in the country at large, but being too small in each individual place to make a breakthrough.

false,DiamondDog123,null,null,"&gt;I don't completely agree, the EU has a bigger diverse economy

They're currently going through a recession, a triple dip one I believe.

&gt;Seeing as most of our trade is with the EU I think we would be hurting ourselves much much more.

Considering we buy more from the EU than we sell to them, I don't see how that's possible.

&gt;We want years of economic problems and uncertainty 

What uncertainty? We'd go from being in the EU, then a period of negotiations, and finally out of the EU with the negotiations having brought trade deals with them at the end of it.

&gt;for what exactly?

So we can get our sovereignty back.

So we aren't dictated to by foreign unelected bureaucrats.

So we can have control over our own laws.

So we can get rid of the mountains of European laws and red tape imposed on us over the decades.

So we can have our fishing industry back, instead of having to throw dead fish back into the ocean on an EU mandate, and let Spanish and French fishers have our fish instead.

So we can control over own borders.

So we can have our own immigration policy, which would let us control the the amount and quality of migrants, instead of an unrestricted mass immigration we have currently.

So we can have our own foreign policy and not have to toe the EU line on it.

So we could get rid of the Common Agricultural Policy costs every family £1200 a year in higher food bills.

So we could get rid of the [European Arrest Warrant.](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2011-11-24a.157.0)

So we wouldn't be paying 50+ million pounds a day for membership of a club that doesn't benefit us.

And many more reasons, just ask at /r/ukipparty, I'm sure lots of folks there will tell you why we should leave the EU.

In addition to supporting Spurs since I was a small child (the product of an early trip to London and the right guidance), I am a rabid Los Angeles Lakers fan, and follow basketball worldwide fairly closely. You're dead to me if you admit to being either an Arsenal or Boston Celtics fan (I don't even like Celtic F.C., as a result of the unintentional association, and support Rangers). I once met a guy who was both an Arsenal AND Celtics fan, and I always try to repress the memory of that encounter.

I'm a gigantic history buff, and read a lot of history (including /r/AskHistorians, which is a great subreddit), and I listen to all sorts of music -- I even run my own small music subreddit /r/classiccovers.

He must be captured alive for interrogation by the Dalek Supreme!"", and stuff like that. Plus, when Davros came along, he rarely resisted the chance to gloat and try to discuss his perceived superiority with the Doctor.  You had similar stuff with the cybermen. They were always going to make him ""become as WE are"" after extracting his knowledge of time travel, or force him to help them in some way.  A lot of it was reminiscent of James Bond being told the antagonist's plot in detail, giving Bond time to wriggle out of danger and win. With the Master, there was always that glimmer of respect for the Doctor, and a desire to boast about his own skills and intelligence.  The Master probably came closer to killing the Doctor (or at least precipitating a regeneration) than anyone.  In Colony in Space, for instance, he (Roger Delgado, the DEFINITIVE Master)pulled a gun on the Doctor and Jo Grant and said ""I'm afraid you're about to become the victims of strayed bullets!"", only lowering it when interrupted by a colonist and having to maintain the disguise he had adopted for that episode (an Earth adjuticator).  Of course, he also stopped other villains from killing the Doctor several times (Daleks, Kronos, sea devils...), under the pretense of needing the Doctor's help, but more likely due to his disdain for the idea of anyone but HIM killing the Doctor. In Trial of a Time Lord, he used the Valeyard IN PART to get rid of the Doctor, but then relented when he realized that the Valeyard was dangerous enough to actually succeed and possibly rob him of being the one to destroy the Doctor.

I'm saying that neo-liberalism, the economic model instituted since the 80's throughout the west is redistributivist. It steals wealth from the many (the middle class) and pools it in the hands of the few (the extremely rich). 

Neoliberalism is not the sound economic model upon with western democracies were built (imo, growing the middle/lower class and giving them disposable income to reinvest in the system). It is a new phenomenon and is widely responsible for the increasing inequality gap.

I am not against free markets. I am a social democrat which implies regulation of markets. Deregulated markets lead to things like the crash of 08.

The politics of the 70's were very different. The unions were too powerful, they need reigning in, but not at the cost of insanely charging in the opposite direction, selling of every public asset we have, bailing out failed banks and financial elites then sharing out the loses to the workers in the form of austerity.

Currently we have a different problem. The corporate class is too powerful. They need reigning in.

I tore my meniscus and partially tore my ACL about 7 months ago, surgery 4 months ago, so I'm really interested in orthopedic surgery (What smart jock isn't?). I have a deep and booming voice and wish at times that I could drop out of college and just become a sport announcer.

I've played soccer my whole life, played goalie for high school but at time I wish I would have played field. absolutely love playing the CM/CDM position that Ryan Mason (Luka Modric) plays as well as Etienne Capoue's position. Scoring is lame, preventing it is ten times for fun.

I really like childish gambino, Kid Cudi, John mayer, jack Johnson, and Coldplay. Chill music is my stuff. I rarely watch TV unless its sports, besides the occasional netflix binge, and that usually is anything to do with Wisconsin sports and Tottenham.

In terms of movies and books I love anything action/ thriller. The bourne series is definitely one of my favorite. As well as the Da Vinci Code.

false,Godhatesfats,null,null,"So is this the official pre-match thread? If so, how many points do you guys think we need from these two upcoming home games? I sat down trying to figure it out; here are my thoughts:

Let's assume that we'll lose against Chelsea and City. Let's also assume that in order to survive we'll need a points:games ratio of rougly 1. In other words, we need to have roughly 38 points by the time the season finishes -- maybe we'll need slightly more, maybe slightly less will be enough, but in any case we need to be around 38.

Beating Liverpool and Villa would mean 10 points in 11 matches played (in keeping with the assumption that we'll lose to Chelsea and City). This is still below the desired ratio but with just one win against either Newcastle (A) or Leicester (H), we're back where we need to be -- and even a bit above it. 

If we ""only"" get a win and a draw, that will mean 8 points in 11 matches. Meaning that against Newcastle and Leicester we'll need to pick up more than 3 points to stay in touch with the ratio of survival (since after those games are done, we'll be on 13 games played in total). 

If we bomb completely against Villa and Liverpool and win neither, then we're pretty much obliged to defeat both Newcastle and Everton. If we do, we'll still be in touch. If not, then I think the ship might have sailed. We'll be on 4-6 points with 13 games played, no win in 10 games -- full-on crisis mode.

In the example I presented, which you agreed with, you and I both get an equal number of votes.  Now you're saying it's unequal?  Look at each round.  We each have 1 vote.  Now, you want to say that each round is a separate vote, and that's fine, but we still have an equal number of votes at each round, and that applies to people who supported major parties and minor parties alike.

In terms of unpopular preferences, I'd just like to point out that unpopular views aren't always wrong.  My family were German Social Democrats in the Sudetenland when it fell to the Nazis.  At the time, about 90% of the populace supported the Nazis.  They were wrong.  We were right.

They are still a bigger and more diverse economy then us still, meaning there recovery may be longer but it has a much bigger potential. 

&gt; Considering we buy more from the EU than we sell to them, I don't see how that's possible.

So that means it would be harder to buy from the EU, companies would not want that and move France to be in the EU market. Look at Vauxhall, who could be one them. 

&gt; What uncertainty? We'd go from being in the EU, then a period of negotiations, and finally out of the EU with the negotiations having brought trade deals with them at the end of it.

You sound a bit like Alex Salmond, I don't agree I think it wouldn't be like that the EU would take a very difficult position because of the fear of other break aways and it could isolate the UK. Also even if we remained in the EEA what would be the point we would still have to have EU regulation but without a say. 

&gt; So we can get our sovereignty back.

You mean the government, we the people lose our voice in Europe and get nothing. 

&gt; So we aren't dictated to by foreign unelected bureaucrats.

The Commission is appointed by each state head of state, so our commissioners are appointed by DC. So its similar to the cabinet in that respect, but we do indirectly get a say through the EU parliament.

&gt; So we can have control over our own laws.
So we can get rid of the mountains of European laws and red tape imposed on us over the decades.

According to the parliamentary Library only 14% of our laws are made in EU and most of those are recommendations not laws, so not that many. 

&gt; So we can have our fishing industry back, instead of having to throw dead fish back into the ocean on an EU mandate, and let Spanish and French fishers have our fish instead.

This has been a continuous issue which the EU commission is dealing with  the problem is other nations also want a voice so we have to negotiate, this is an on going thing. 

&gt; So we can control over own borders.
So we can have our own immigration policy, which would let us control the the amount and quality of migrants, instead of an unrestricted mass immigration we have currently.

I fundamentally don't see the point when it come to it in  EU migration, lots of economic indicators show the success of EU migration, and the free movement is a double edge sword and benefits over 2 million brits working in Europe. 

&gt; So we can have our own foreign policy and not have to toe the EU line on it.

We can, did you miss Libya? Germany Britain, France all had different policy even to that of the EU we can have a different one. Look at Hungary in relation to Russia. 

&gt; So we could get rid of the Common Agricultural Policy costs every family £1200 a year in higher food bills.

Though removing CAP would not lower food prices, due to super markets not wanting to reduce prices anyway. I do agree CAP should be reformed and we could do that if we participated in the EU.  

&gt; So we could get rid of the European Arrest Warrant.

I disagree we need it so we can catch criminals who escape on to the continent. 

&gt; So we wouldn't be paying 50+ million pounds a day for membership of a club that doesn't benefit us.

We get a large portion of that back in the rebate. Plus that membership does pay for a large parts of the institutions like the Parliament, insurance, healthcare, and Erasmus which are good benefits.

similarly I started watching Elementary, a modern adaptation of Sherlock Holmes set in New York. it's much more a police procedural show than Sherlock is, with a female watson. somehow Jonny Lee Miller's portrayal of holmes just isn't as enjoyable as Cumberbatch's, he's far more serious and almost a little boring. the familiar tropes of sherlock holmes are all there (making extremely precise deductions about XYZ then explaining the thinking behind it when watson/police people are incredulous) and the absence from this in some scenes of Sherlock was quite nice as well; sometimes holmes would just state something and there wouldn't be an explanation.

I finally decided to give Twin Peaks a go after its return to television was announced, and the show is extremely weird. there seems to only be one piece of music written for the show but it plays under *everything*. the characters are mostly extremely weird, lots of melodramatic performances but I've been told that's kind of the point. I'm only 4 episodes in I think but supposedly the show shakes things up massively pretty soon. it's got a datedness to it that makes it a little tough to sit through compared to modern shows, especially with the fashion and acting styles, but it's also got this charm to it. it also reminded me of the fact that shows used to have effects in their scene changes; today, the scenes often just straight up cut to the next one, maintaining a pace or intentionally disrupting it, often with musical cues accompanying. twin peaks has most scenes fade into the next I think, and with the constant soundtrack playing, it is very odd to watch.",0,1413480633,null,0,false,0,clb8rde,t3_2jf75u,t1_clb8rde,t3_2jf75u,null,1426497949,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I used to be an avid reader, but have less time to do so now; I typically stick to two sorts of books: historical nonfiction and fantasy (LotR, ASoIaF, etc). As for food, I'm half Indian and half Arab, so I like Middle Eastern, Indian food, and chocolate (mmmmmm).

I sort of like it, I mostly wanted to go into law enforcement after high school, but since I moved down here from Canada, I decided to purse another path. The reason I moved down here you may ask? Well it's kind of a scary story. In high school I dated this girl for 2 years. Let's just call her Jessica. Well Jessica was very beautiful, I loved her but she was a bit...odd. I broke up with her after 2 years because I just was done with the relationship. She wanted marriage, I said no because I'm 18 at the time and I wanted to explore opportunities. After that, she started stalking me. It's scary being stalked. I would catch her putting letters in my mailbox (I moved out at 17, always been on the mature side.) Saying all these creepy things, watching me from her car at night was also creepy. Thank god we went to different schools. Right after graduation, me and some friends took a trip to Florida just to celebrate. That's when I met my current SO. She was a year younger, lived in Florida, also on her own and it was kind of love at first sight you could say I guess. I stayed there with her, got a visa to study down here and here we are now. Anyways, that's my story of how we got here.

I like rock music. You know, Aerosmith, Beatles, ACDC, the Police, Queen. 

I like lots of movies. Don't have a favourite kind, like pretty much anything that's not a horror movie.

I eat mostly vegetarian. I will however treat myself to the odd piece of chicken but I'm mostly a vegetarian.

I'm currently ready If I Stay because we recently saw the movie, pretty good book. I'll read really anything.

I don't watch much TV. When I do, it's Football or Hockey.

I agree.

The Nazis didn't always want Jews exterminated, not at first. They just wanted Jews gone and out of their country, out of their empire. That's why they had a plan to send them to Madagascar or to Palestine. Jews had a right to live, as long as they lived somewhere else.

But the underlying idea was the same as the Kippers' - that some groups of people don't deserve to be here.

&gt;You mean the government, we the people lose our voice in Europe and get nothing. 

What has our ""voice"" in Europe gotten us so far? Immigration has been seen as one of the biggest issues for over a decade, yet we still have absolutely zero change to the free movement of people.

&gt;You sound a bit like Alex Salmond, I don't agree I think it wouldn't be like that the EU would take a very difficult position because of the fear of other break aways and it could isolate the UK. Also even if we remained in the EEA what would be the point we would still have to have EU regulation but without a say. 

So you're saying that the EU is so tyrannical it would purposely punish a country for daring to not want to be a part of it.

Why should we want to be part of such a monstrosity?

Not to mention, the WTO wouldn't allow the EU to ""isolate"" Europe.

&gt;According to the parliamentary Library only 14% of our laws are made in EU and most of those are recommendations not laws, so not that many. 

According to EU commissioner Viviane Reding ""“Seventy per cent of the laws in this country are co-decided by the European Parliament”""

According to the 2010 House of Commons Library report

“The British Government estimates that around 50% of UK legislation with a significant economic impact originates from EU legislation. ""

http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/RP10-62.pdf

&gt;This has been a continuous issue which the EU commission is dealing with the problem is other nations also want a voice so we have to negotiate, this is an on going thing. 

It's been around since 1970. How much longer do you expect this to be ""on going""?

It's never going to change while we're in the EU, otherwise it would have been changed over the last 44 years.

&gt;I fundamentally don't see the point when it come to it in EU migration, lots of economic indicators show the success of EU migration, and the free movement is a double edge sword and benefits over 2 million brits working in Europe. 

I agree, the GDP increases a few points thanks to cheap labour for big business, but this is scarce comfort for the working class brits who don't want to live with six other men in a one bedroom flat, to work at a minimum wage job to send money back home to poland where it's worth fifty times more.

Not to mention, there is no way to plan infrastructure, because we have no idea how many are coming, and no way to control it.

&gt;We can, did you miss Libya? Germany Britain, France all had different policy even to that of the EU we can have a different one. Look at Hungary in relation to Russia. 

I'm more concerned about Ukraine, considering the EU was meant to bring peace and stability to Europe, it seems awfully bent on expanding it's empire.

&gt;Though removing CAP would not lower food prices, due to super markets not wanting to reduce prices anyway. I do agree CAP should be reformed and we could do that if we participated in the EU. 

We've participated in the EU for 44 years, and there has been no reform. This silly notion of ""if only we got MORE involved in Europe, all of the EUs issues would go away"" is just europhilic bait.

&gt;I disagree we need it so we can catch criminals who escape on to the continent. 

We did this before the EU, it's called extradition treaties and police forces working together. Not to mention the European Arrest Warrant ends up making things like [this](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2011-11-24a.157.0) happen, a gross travesty of justice if I've ever seen it.

&gt;We get a large portion of that back in the rebate. Plus that membership does pay for a large parts of the institutions like the Parliament, insurance, healthcare, and Erasmus which are good benefits. 

Except all that money could instead be directed to needworthy places in our own country.

Thanks for responding with well thought out answers by the way, I wish more Pro-EU folks would do that.

Fabian Delph and Philippe Senderos have emerged as injury doubts for Villa's trip to Everton - but skipper Ron Vlaar is available.

Delph is struggling with a shoulder injury ahead of Saturday's trip to Goodison Park.

And Senderos missed Switzerland's Euro 2016 qualifier against San Marino on Tuesday with a thigh problem.

But there is positive news for Vlaar - pictured above in training today - who has recovered from the calf injury that kept him out of Villa's last four Barclays Premier League games.

In a further boost, manager Paul Lambert says Christian Benteke is also pushing for a start after making his return from the substitutes bench in the defeat to Manchester City earlier this month.

""There are one or two there who I need to wait and see about,"" said Lambert. 

""At the minute, they are doubtful for Saturday.

""Fabian and Philippe are the doubts but on the plus side, Ron is back and Benteke is pushing to start, so they're two of the main ones.

""You're never sure what's going to happen when they go away but you've got to accept that they're going to go and try and get results for their country.

""But you do hope that they come back and everybody's fine.""

Asked if Benteke could start against the Toffees, Lambert added: ""He's in the squad. There's a good chance.

""He's trained really well and looking like his old self in the last week or so.

""He scored up here last week against Leicester in a friendly game so there is a chance. He'll be in the squad and I'll decide tomorrow.""",0,1413482444,null,0,false,0,clb9s20,t3_2jfkzv,t1_clb9s20,t3_2jfkzv,null,1426497474,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1

For starters, they have far more preconceptions about the material they're producing and that produces a much narrower vision of the show than someone who appreciates the material and creates a much more open interpretation. 

We've seen it happen many times already with various comic- and book-to-movie adaptations movies where they brought on a fan to write and direct and the result was less than spectacular. Each one has their unique vision and some deviate so far from the original author's message that it becomes something else altogether. After watching some classic Who and even earlier episodes of the reboot don't even seem like the same show.

Oh and spend a bit of money to get your suit altered to fit correctly. It's ALWAYS worth it. 

Another tip. Go for neutral colour and shirts that you can match with multiple ties. A pack of stock white and stock blue shirts works really well with the right combo of ties. 

If you go on amazon , they do some nice tie+pocket square combos. Trust me a pocket square and a tie - you look class. Just keep the colours pretty mature but not boring and you'll be very cool.

Plenty of people in the 1930s thought international socialism was a malevolent ideology intent on establishing a supranational state (the Comintern reads a lot like the Islamic caliphate if you're on the receiving end). 

Remember from the point-of-view of many of the fighters in Syria they *are* fighting fascism... they're standing up against the brutal Assad regime and striking a blow for freedom, just like the guys who stood against Franco.  In fact many Leftwing pressure groups have spent the last few years highlighting that Assad draws most of his support from the far-right... he is literally a fascist in their eyes, the sort of person the Int. Brigades would have been marching against 80yrs ago.

Bear in mind the West was gearing up to provide arms and financial support to these guys to overthrow Assad, until we realised how brutal they are.  But for a bored 21 y/old Muslim lad in Rochdale the idea of travelling to fight for the caliphate against ""Assad the Fascist"" is a pretty noble aspiration.

The economic benefits of being a part of the largest single market in the world, and being able to trade goods in that area with relative ease, are massive. 

You can only see what this means through this very website, and through other American tech companies like Facebook and Google. Someone who starts a website in their bedroom in America has a home market of hundreds of millions of people, all speaking the same language, operating within the same legal system, watching similar media, and so on. This doesn't work in that specific case in the EU at present because of the language barrier, but those sorts of benefits are constantly accruing in the background for industries which are not so language dependent. If you set up a business manufacturing car parts, or making business software, or whiskey, or providing architectural services, or doing anything across huge swathes of the economy, you can sell from the first day within a market of 500 million people. Your representatives are also shaping standards which may well become global standards. And even the language-based barriers are likely to fall away, given the rate at which other European countries are picking up English as a second/business language.

The problem is that we as a nation don't understand the EU well enough to justify and accept the terms under which we remain members, or to form alliances with like minded countries to shape the Union in the ways that we would like. The vast majority of legislation in the EU is made up of technical trading measures, so that people can trade goods in a standardized way, and our politicians treat these laws as if they were equivalent to major pieces of legislation that happen in the UK, on health, education, defense, etc. When we throw our weight around, it is for domestic consumption, not well thought through, and badly timed, and we end up throwing ourselves against brick walls.",0,1413483335,null,0,1413484405,0,clba9ya,t3_2jffbi,t1_clba9ya,t3_2jffbi,null,1426497241,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

It is my choice, as an adult that is eligible to vote, not to. I'm basically so disenfranchised with politics that I now ignore it completely.

I'll give you some background. The under 30s are being completely shafted and nobody with power is interested in doing anything about this situation. I used to want to change this situation and became involved in campaigning against unpaid internships, low wages, and housing affordability. 

I was involved fully for about 5 years and even spoke on a few radio shows about this issues. I was also invited onto channel 4 news but couldn't make it (they were shocked that I didn't work in London,  near their studios). 

I've now given it all up because of the lack of appetite to change this situation. That's from those with power and from and the apathetic public. I'm bored of the pr polished, widest appealing, irresponsible partisan bollocks. 

I actually think that if you get involved and ""chose a side"", and that if you hoover up and dish out the bullshit from the side that you chose, that you are part of the problem. 

So I decided that the system was broken and won't deliver any positive change for anytime soon. 

I decided that all of the effort I was making campaigning and raising awareness, was actually better off put into being selfish and winning the game.

And that's why I'm subscribed to subreddits like this as I'm now focused on making as much money as I can, and not getting upset or stressed about major fucking injustices that I can do nothing about.

I am not saying that the new populist right in Britain are proto-fascists, neo-fascists, or anything like the European fascists of the past century. I don’t believe that in the end my fellow–Britons could ever be led on to the madness that was 1930s Germany. I retain a faith in the essential decency of most of my countrymen — and, more important, their ingrained restraint and sense of proportion.

&gt;So let me say it again: I see not a glimmer of the dawn of fascism in modern Britain, and to say otherwise would be scare-mongering; I know of no significant political figures today who would even dream of going that way; and, yes, for the record, that does include the leadership of Ukip.",0,1413483937,null,0,false,0,clbamlx,t3_2jfv15,t1_clbamlx,t3_2jfv15,null,1426497077,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Honestly, I just want an invincible season so that there would be nothing that we haven't won, and it would be immensely pleasing to better Arsenal. 

However I think that there have been a lot of comparisons to 04/05 and talk of us being the invincibles this season is a little too hasty and over reaching. 

Just stay focused at the next game, records don't matter, right? I really hope Jose doesn't let this pressure of being better than our 04/05 team or Arsenal's team with all this media hype get to our boys.

Music-wise, my favorite band right now is probably The 1975 (they're new, from Manchester). Also been listening to a bunch of stuff from The Glitch Mob, Chvrches, Bleachers, and a few others that I got to see at Austin City Limits Music Festival this past weekend.

I watch a ton of shows, favorite is probably Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. Boardwalk Empire is also up there, and sneaking in at #3 is either Modern Family or Sleepy Hollow.

I play pickup and on an indoor team with my company for fun, and trying to get back into running now (I did track and field in high school, 1:57.98 for 800m).

My books these days are mostly programming books, focusing on getting through Effective Java (very famous one that programmers of all languages can learn from) and Apple's Swift book.

I started supporting Spurs through Championship Manager after my uncle bought me the game as a gift upon my arrival in America. I chose to manage Spurs and then slowly but surely I was sucked into following their results and then finally becoming a full fledged die hard. I'm the only Spurs supporter I know of in my life, so I'm surrounded by hordes of Chelsea, United, Arsenal, and Liverpool fans.

I like all kinds of music ranging from EDM, to hip hop, to world music, to folk, etc. If it sounds good, I like it. Same goes for movies, although I'm a bit more selective. My favorite movies are the Godfather series, pt. 1 &amp; 2 in particular. My favorite TV shows are Vikings, The Wire, GoT, Breaking Bad, True Detective, and shows of that ilk. My favorite food is injera (traditional Eritrean/Ethiopian dish).

At the same time though there are many many more top quality players who never progress that quickly that early. Matic would almost be a fair example. So sometimes it's a shame when players aren't given time to develop by the top clubs ending up with so many releases or players who looked good at 18 stalling and ending up moving on later when there really isn't that much interest in picking up a 26 year old.  It's also partially why Chelsea operate with such a large loan system to combat it with many players who are kind of past wonderkid age in the hopes they will develop still.

--------------------

* **QPR:** I think we beat QPR on Sunday away. 


* **Madrid (Home**): Great atmosphere, but I think a draw is the best case scenario.


* **Hull and Swansea (Home)**: Three matches in six days will catch up and I think we'll have a typical struggle against a mid-table side at home. I can see a tight draw or win at Hull and wouldn't be surprised to barely scrap by Swansea.


* **Newcastle:** I think we handle and take three points away


* **Madrid (Away):** Who knows, but again, draw is the best case scenario if we're being realistic about playing Real Madrid at the Bernabeu.


* **Chelsea (Home):** We all know what Chelsea are this season. They are unbeaten for a reason and look like the team they ought to be. I think we lose this one.

River Song (from Forest of the Dead): When you run with the Doctor, it feels like it'll never end. But however hard you try you can't run forever. Everybody knows that everybody dies and nobody knows it like the Doctor. But I do think that all the skies of all the worlds might just turn dark if he ever, for one moment, accepts it.

Now and then, every once in a very long while, every day in a million days, when the wind stands fair and the Doctor comes to call, everybody lives.

All these evils I have fought while you have done nothing but observe. True, I am guilty of interference, just as you are guilty of failing to use your great powers to help those in need

Tenth Doctor (from Evolution of the Daleks): There have been too many deaths today. Way too many people have died. Brand new creatures and wise old men and age-old enemies, and I tell you, I tell you right now, I am not having one more death! The Doctor is in!

I try to watch Spurs every game, but unfortunately it seems to clash with football games of my own pretty often, but I make sure to watch a replay of the game if possible. Other than that I enjoy music and cooking, and while not good at playing music, I consider myself to be pretty decent at cooking.

I enjoy relatively quiet music. I have a soft spot for indie music, and some of my favourite artists are Passenger, James Blake, Capital Cities and Lukas Graham (a Danish artist - I highly recommend you to check him out).

Interns get work that doesn't need to be done, and far, far more often than not, the results are useless and get trashed after they leave. Furthermore, the intern usually needs training and supervision, so even if they are unpaid, they are actually a net drain on the business.

Much the same can be said of any new graduate hire. I myself was pretty useless, for at least the first year after I got my first job after University.

Why do companies do it then? Well after a year or two, graduates tend to start getting more productive. There's fierce competition for *those* graduates, who have a bit of experience. If you are *already* employing them, then you have a big head start in that race. Graduates *do* shop around for new jobs at that stage, but enough of them must stay on to make the year or two of investment worth the employer's while. Make no mistake how much that costs, expecially in terms of the cost of employing people to supervise and train the interns &amp; new grads.

Personally, I think that interns should be paid at least expenses, and I'd like to see the government chipping in with a proportion of the benefits they would otherwise be due. Internships should be principally about learning, not about doing a job.

I'm not saying that all is right with the world, but pouring approbrium on the companies that *do* give graduates a chance to get some experience just seems a little unfair, and counter productive.

After all, they don't *have* to take on graduates. They could just hire experienced staff, as many other companies do. Then when the supply of good candidates starts to tail off, they can just outsource, or bring in people from India... even UKIP supports skilled migrants after all.

So yes there is a problem to be solved, but I don't think labelling employers who are trying to help as ""unscrupulous"" is very productive.

&gt;a 'superfan'

Fandom devours what it loves; the last person you'd want in charge is a fan. Imagine an obsessive lover who takes over your life and turns it into an extension of their ego - sometimes love can be a hideously corrupting force.

&gt;We've seen it happen many times already with various comic- and book-to-movie adaptations movies where they brought on a fan to write and direct and the result was less than spectacular. E

A case in point. On the other hand, Kenneth Branagh and John Favreau weren't fanboys and they did an excellent job on their respective MCU outings.

&gt;If you're a fan for as long as Moffat claims to have been, what you get is basically a fanfic'd version of the show that's been in his head for years.

He's JNT on steroids.

I would recommend against using BP all over, it kills everything even the good microbes on your skin and is very drying. I've known people really struggle to withdraw from using it regularly with rebound breakouts.

The Freederm Daily Complex definitely does something anti inflammatory for me (just diagnosed mild papulopustular rosacea) and that is a larger pack size but likely lower percentage.

There is also the **Nicam** brand gel (4%) on prescription and I think also over the counter. I am sure it is a bigger pack size than Freederm too, maybe ask in the pharmacy? There might even be other generics.

Other than that DIY KinNiaNAG serum. I used that as my only moisturiser for a while, which really surprised me given I tend to dryness/ eczema.

**ETA** Nicam comes in a 60ml size but would be pricey if not on prescription ~£10.

false,Yellowbenzene,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"I worked 13.5 hours a day (08:00-21:30) for 7 days in a row on a regular basis when I was a junior doctor on the surgical wards, and it was on-call so most days I didn't get any breaks apart from 15 minutes twice a day if I was lucky.  It was draining, physically, mentally and emotionally intense work that left all of us completely knackered at the end of the stint.  By the end of the week you were so tired that making a mistake was a very real possibility, yet there was nobody else to do the work or to give you any help because the rota was designed for a bare minimum safe level of staffing.  This story is replicated up and down the country and *right now* there will be hundreds of overworked, tired, and poorly supported doctors at work on the wards.  

Fixing staffing levels would go a long way to reducing the number of mistakes, I think.  This comes down to money, money, money.  ""Creating a culture where mistakes are not an option"" is an impossibility when we are already at bare minimum staffing levels in many hospitals across the country.  It wasn't uncommon for there to be only one trained nurse to look after 30 patients on my ward due to staff cuts.  That is a perfect situation for mistakes to happen, such as drug administration errors, patients not being checked frequently enough, or the doctors' management plan not being enacted quickly enough.  

We already have one of the most tightly-regulated and examined medical workforces in the world and standards are high as a result.  But one thing we really don't want to happen is for those people to decide that working in the NHS is no longer worth it, and to emigrate, retire, or start private work instead.  This is already happening with the new ""revalidation"" scheme the GMC has put into effect.  It's so much paperwork that many people near retirement - expert, seasoned doctors - are simply retiring early.  We also need to be very careful that the next generation of doctors are not put off by the profession being squeezed so hard that it's no longer an attractive career.

Khedira would make our side basically invincible.
Khedira and Matic combo would be one of the best center midfield combos we will see. Both can pass, both can defend and both are extremely intelligent and tall players. 6'2 and 6'4 respectively.
You put Khedira and Matic together, and give Cesc the freedom of the park to attack and we have a much better side.

Right now with Cesc and Oscar(or Willian) playing together we are not getting the best out of either of them. Both are getting put in situations where they have to cover for the other and has led in all our games so far to not being able to control the midfield. Even though we won all our games so far we have yet to dominate a side. Everton obviously had their chances, Burnley was definitely in the game when we played them and Leciseter was a fairly open affair as well.
We have been leaving Matic exposed far too long and it has been telling in his performances this year. With our current style he is basically playing as a lone defensive mid and has Cesc and Oscar trying to help him but neither obviously a proper defender.

Matic needs a better box to box partner for me, Pogba would have been perfect but Khedira is extremely good as well. Hopefully Mourinho is thinking the same. I would take Matic, Khedira, Fabregas over Matic, Fabregas, Oscar any day.

Why don't the landlords rent the properties out. The only reasons I can think of for not doing so are:

* The property will be redeveloped or sold in too short a time scale to rent out.
* The property requires renovation to rent out and the developer doesn't think they can recoup the money.
* Lowering the rental price too much and attracting the wrong tenants would cause a reduction in value of the landlords neighbouring properties.
* There is no demand for rental properties

I get to talk to people about their problems and help turn their account of the story into a piece of court evidence. In school, quizbowl (basically a general knowledge game with eight buzzers, even practice gets heated) is my passion. I've been there for four years and got made captain this year. Model UN and Debate are really fun too. My college major is probably going to involve some Poli Sci and a language as a minor, as I want to be an FSO.  

Outside of that, I really like Major Lazer, Kanye, Interpol, Joy Division, and Beach House. Louie and GoT are probably my favorite shows, but Maron is growing on me.

The worst houses I ever lived in were ones which were cold and damp, so look out for any signs of damp, it usually looks like black spots on the walls or on window frames and curtains, another sign is condensation on windows.

While you're looking around check if it's heated by storage heaters or central heating as central heating is cheaper and better. Also ask if the house has gas central heating and cooking as Gas is also cheaper than electric.

Ask how much the bills are and how they're sorted out between you. Find out things like what TV and internet packages they have.

Also find out what the tenants are like, you'll want people you can get along with so find out what they do for a living, where they go out, whether they have people over and if they mind you bringing friends over (some people can be funny about this but it's also a good way of checking if they have wild parties every night)

That's all I can think of off the top of my head.

The amount paid to people is not based on their productivity, companies pay as little as possible in return for as much work as possible in order to maximise profits. Removal of the minimum wage for arbitrarily defined disability would end up with all employers reducing the amount they paid disabled people to the newly decided minimum, safe in the knowledge that the taxpayer would make up the shortfall between the pay and the actual cost of living.

If a private company requires subsidy, including in work benefits for its employees, then its business model is not viable, and they should call it a day.

Honestly, they come apart pretty easily and it is a car where simple thing like breaking the pins from the door cards, don't really happen that easily. Up until the 2008 Hawkeye models, there seems to be a lot of backwards compatibility (door cards and seats from a Hawkeye fit my Bugeye perfectly). They are based on rally cars after all, so replacing parts quickly is a priority.

However, top mounted oil filters were added after my engine model. My filter is at the bottom somewhere under the plastic plate. On at least one of the older versions, the front transmission drain plug very close to the engine oil drain plug, so you have to be careful to do the right one. The boxer engine, being sideways, presents problem though, especially when it comes to head gaskets and spark plugs as they aren't accessible from the top. It's quite a bit harder to work on when compared to the Corsa B which was my first car and had enough room to almost walk around the engine bay.

Saying that, if I had access to a ramp, many thing would be much easier to do. General maintenance, beyond spark plugs, isn't too hard. The timing belt is also a pretty easy job to do compared to other cars, although I do not have the confidence to try that yet.

You have to put a deposit and usually at least a months rent up front, normally similar amounts (a few hundred pounds each) but your deposit should go in to a deposit protection scheme where a third party holds it until you move out in case of disputes over damage etc. 

Bills are also fairly straightforward. When you view a place ask how the bills are dealt with. They will normally just be split straight between housemates equally and the main ones are council tax (you can check the council tax band of a property online), gas, electric, water, tv license, internet/tv/phone bundle, and I'd recommend contents insurance for your stuff, but it can be difficult getting quotes for houseshares as insurers see it as risky, so this may be expensive and not feasible, so you'll need to be security conscious. 

Taxes is the easiest as unless you're self employed you should be on PAYE so it comes straight off your pay before it goes in your bank (you must already know this as you are 21 and working?)

What is the major event happening in the book? The Depression. The depression left people in survival mode, so the ""american dream"" was to be happy in isolation, so Steinbeck used this as a goal because it shows how people during the time wanted the american dream, because there were so desperate.

2. What quotes are the most important?

Here, you need to pick and choose which quotes to use. The most important ones will be from the first time Lenny begs George talk about the dream (*tell the story, George... I wanna hear like you say it*) and when the same dream is brought up in Lenny's death. 

Also, consider the dream from other characters perspective. Candy also becomes interested in the being a part of the plan. Why do you think he is interested? What's his motivation and why does he volunteer himself even though he is not long for this world?

Since I put off most of my movie-viewing for law school, I'm trying to catch up in a major way, and currently going through a ~250-film-long list of movies that are divided by time period so that I can watch films from as many eras, styles, and genres as possible.  Recently I've watched Doctor Zhivago, On the Waterfront, Godzilla (the new one), The Shining, and Gentleman's Agreement.  This weekend I'm watching Kung Fu Hustle.  Obviously, my tastes are eclectic.

The other side of this coin is that I'm trying to catch up on TV too.  I am an endless evangelist for Orphan Black, but right now I'm keeping up with Doctor Who, Spartacus, and the British sci-fi conspiracy show Utopia.

false,OftenItalic,null,null,"Fabregas plays better in a holding role than at 10. I think the 4-2-3-1 would stay the same but he'd replace Ramires in a 4-3-3. I also think the team would play 4-3-3 more often but when it's playing 4-2-3-1 Khedira would rotate for Matic if he was injured or needed resting but otherwise would sit on the bench and then maybe come on for Fabregas if/ when Jose wants to close the game. If Jose wanted to drop Oscar I feel like he would have done it already, especially if the rumours of PSG's approach are true and they were going to offer a lot. He feels like a guaranteed starter and a player that Mourinho likes. Ramires is the one who I see losing out most here to the extent that I could easily see him leaving if Khedira was coming in.",0,1413506105,null,0,false,0,clbmk9o,t3_2jfz3o,t1_clbmk9o,t1_clbhn8n,null,1426490484,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2
