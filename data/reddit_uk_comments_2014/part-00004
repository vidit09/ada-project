true,admittedlynerdy,null,null,"Dramas: 

**The Hour** was cancelled after series 2 but is wonderful, set during the Cold War with lots of intrigue along with great character arcs. Peter Capaldi is so amazing in series 2, and completely different in it than any other thing I've seen him in.

**Jekyll** is pretty cool, another show where Steven Moffat updates a classic literary tale to modern day. It only got one series and ends on a cliffhanger as a result but is worth watching nonetheless.

Another show that ends in a cliffhanger because it was cancelled is **Survivors** (2008), which follows a small group of people who survive a super flu and have to figure out how to make a life after most of the population has died.

The first few series of **Being Human** are pretty rad, but it kind of peters off in quality after a while.

And I wholeheartedly second **Sherlock**, **Orphan Black**, and **Misfits** (I actually liked all 5 series of it and would say to check out the whole show).

Comedies:

The guys who wrote **Peep Show** have another great show called **Fresh Meat** that just finished series 3. It's an hour long show about freshman starting university in Manchester and has dramatic elements but tons of laughs.

**Friday Night Dinner** is a great Channel 4 comedy about a Jewish couple and their college-aged sons getting together for dinner every Friday. All of the actors are phenomenal. It's had 2 series and a Christmas special so far.

**That Mitchell &amp; Webb Look** is some of the best sketch comedy I've ever seen on TV.

And I very much second **The IT Crowd** and **The In-Betweeners**.

Yep, the problem is government tends to play things safe and go with big corporates who have large legal departments and very persuasive sales/account management teams. They also have the advantage of offering all the services that surround an IT project once it goes live, such as 

* Infrastructure (e.g. hosting and uptime support)
* 7am - 7pm first &amp; third line support for users
* Development roadmaps
* Business analyst teams

This means most government projects go to companies like ATOS, IBM, Accenture, Logica, Capita etc and these projects can last for *years*

I used to work for one of the companies above, working on projects for various arms of the public sector.

There's probably a few things to consider - banks have bands for interest rates. If you can get a 25% deposit, your interest rate will be a lot lower than 10% - but you need to look at what you need to spend in your area and how much you can afford to save.

The other difficulty would be proving income, especially if it's sporadic. It's not insurmountable but may be a hurdle, depending on circumstances. I know people who contract for a living who swear by rental - they can rent a really nice house and average out their income. But if it takes a dive, they can take a full time job and move somewhere cheaper without any great loss. Bear in mind when you own, moving is a very expensive game!

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"&gt; ""Unfortunately"" Oscar is undroppable at the moment.

Why is it unfortunate that Oscar is better?

No player is bigger than the club. Whoever plays the best deserves the spot. All this favouritism means fuck all if you care about the team rather than an individual's playing time. Mata has played the central role this season but this seasons Mata is not as good as this years Oscar. People don't realize this but Mata isn't playing that much worse, it is the others who have stepped up and settled more.

Oscar in particular is one of the most complete players on the squad. Theres a reason Arsenal fall short and prove to be shit year around and that is because they are loaded to the brim with one dimensional players like Walcott who on their day seem great but as a whole weaken the team.

We need more Hazards, Oscars and Willians. Mata on his day is one of the best mids in the league but you need players who even if they are playing badly will bring something else to the table to keep the squads stregnth up like Hazard's ability to suck players in and Oscars ability to track back and break attacks. This results in then contributing even when they are playing badly. I love Mata but when he has an off day he offers nothing else to counter it. No hold up play, little tracking back and doesn't have Schurrle, Hazard, Oscar and Willian's stregnth either. 

Jose isn't obsessed with players who track back, that is his way of simple wording it for the media because by the logic Schurrle will be his second favorite after Ramires. He is obsessed with complete players.",0,1388926192,null,0,1388926940,0,cehtql8,t3_1uf9y9,t1_cehtql8,t1_cehn99g,null,1431807612,4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,4

We have Economics and Psychology as their own courses, then HSPS for the rest (it's a mix of politics, sociology, anthropology and so on), so that might affect your decision of where to apply and which course to do.

I get the impression that admissions mostly care that you get good marks in the subjects you're taking to A2, and they usually don't even look at critical thinking or general studies. So as long as your personal statement makes it clear that you enjoy what you're doing, you should be fine. As for extra-curriculars, you should put about one paragraph in your personal statement - they like to see that you're doing *something* other than work but aren't particularly bothered what or how much.

If you get an interview, in general you get one interview about your subject and then one with your subject's Director of Studies which is a more general one. They'll often ask you about a couple of things on your personal statement, so it helps to remind yourself what's on it before you go.

If you make an open application you could be put in almost any of the colleges, and there are a couple (ie, Girton, which is two miles outside of Cambridge) which are quite far away from where you'll have lectures.

The whole concept of land ownership is quite bizarre when looked at objectively. Most of the land we live on is owned by private individuals who contributed absolutely nothing to its presence. The Duke of Westminster, who I doubt has ever done a day’s deductive work in his life, is the biggest landowner in this land, and how this land was first acquired is lost in the midst of the Dark Ages and barbarism. **I once saw a debate on TV in which a Scottish aristocrat insisted that his ancestors had fought for the land he owned, whereon a member of the audience stood up, took his jacket off and said “OK, I’ll fight you for it!”**. Karl Marx described early society as “primitive communism” because we hunted, gathered and consumed collectively, and the basic family unit operates as a commune. We’re constantly told that war and greed are natural, but as I pointed out to you a few weeks ago, the last time I hit anybody or anybody hit me, I was drunk, and that is most people’s experience.”

You can get a 3 year fixed that costs £471 per month. At the end of those two years, you'll have paid off around £7k (it's actually about £6700, but again, round figures). As such, you'll now have ""paid off"" £17k of the value of the original sale price. Now, let's assume that your house price has remained static. This is a *BIG* assumption. You're now into 85% LTV, but equally, if you can punt another £3k into things, you'll get to 80% LTV. So, although interest rates may have gone up, you'll equally be able to get a better product because you own more of your house. Assuming interest rates are still the same (again, a big assumption) you can fix again for 3 years, but this time be paying just £365 per month. You're saving over £100 (assumes 80% LTV). If you've not managed to put £3k by, then you can still fix for 3 years and be paying £394/month. Still a considerable amount less each month. 

The secret is to constantly shop around for mortgage products when you're able to, and not to be on SVR and the like.

Once the LTV gets lower (ie you have more collateral/capital to play with), the risk for the lender becomes lower, so you have to pay less on two counts: 1) Because they're lending you less, and 2) because the interest rate is lower (due to the perceived lower risk).

You pay £160k back on a mortgage due to interest charges. It's often said that, for the first three years, you pay back next to no capital as you're purely paying interest. Again, assuming the theoretical house for £100k - let's say you put in £10k and through sheer luck, judgement and so on pay 3.9% for 25 years. No overpayments, nada. You'd pay back a shade over £140k for the ability to borrow £90k. So your house worth £100k has cost £150k (once you factor in your initial deposit).

In that case it doesn't matter if you play 4-4-2 or 4-3-3 or 3-4-1-2 or 4-2-3-1. There is not really much to argue about his statement. Arsenal didn't create a lot when they tried to build from the back. When we conceded the first goal we lost the ball during a transition from defence to attack and they scored from it. The second goal was caused by a brainfart by Rose, hardly due to their extra man in midfield.

The question is, do we try to win the game by playing to our strengths or by trying to negate Arsenals strengths? Sherwood obviously tried to win it by playing to our strenghts, and that's the way we should play in my opinion.

Losing 2-0 away to Arsenal, one of the best teams in the league, is hardly a disaster, we have won once there in like 25 years.

Maybe that's because he was a teenager?

I could say Townsend doesn't have a footballing brain, because all he does for Spurs and England is run with the ball from the touchline and shoot from 30 yards over the bar.

But I'd be idiotic to say that because he is 22 and has potential, his decision making needs work on but that comes with age.

&gt;After years of training with top coaches and players he has become more effective but he's still not a great player.

Hence the footballing brain...he has become better with age and is still only 24.

&gt;His success is largely based on his searing pace and the quality players around him.

Of course because his stengths are met with Ozil, Cazorla, Ramsey and Wilshere's strengths - creativity and through balls.

Did you watch Arsenal when Walcott was injured? Ozil, Cazorla and Wilshere didn't look anywhere near as effective as they were without a winger making runs.

We look a much better outfit when Walcott is playing. Without Walcott's runs Ozil and Cazorla will look mediocre (like they did against Man United).

&gt;Once his pace goes he'll need to retire because he'll be exposed for the very ordinary player he is.

1. 'Speculation' in agriculture: has enriched farmers, which has enabled them to purchase better inputs (fertilisers, pesticides etc), which has boosted yields, which has led to a drop in malnutrition for most of the planet. This is my primary speciality, so please feel free to ask further questions. Haiti is a terrible example, as agriculture is the least of their current and past problems.

2. Oil 'speculation': as prices have gone up (thank you OPEC) this has actually rebalanced world oil production so that it doesn't all come out of the ME. A key factor in developing new resources is the price attainable by the product - most new fields could not have been developed without oil being above $100 per barrel.

3. Less sure on wealth inequality. There has been a concentration of wealth at the top over the last decade, but living standards for most have also risen too. Case in point, less than 5% of the world's population now live below the poverty line. Could definitely be better, but at the end of the day most UK citizens live a pretty comfortable life.

4. The mines.. **The Callaghan government closed more mines than Thatcher ever did.** They were uneconomical, they were losing money hand over fist, and the only reason they still existed was because they were not run as any normal business should be. While the closures certainly could have been managed better, there was no way those mines could have stayed open. Plus, coal mining is pretty destructive stuff as well as being bad for the miners and the air.

The Fifth Doctor was very affable, emotional and beloved by his companions, so the Sixth Doctor became an arrogant egotist, bordering on narcissism, until he mellowed a bit.

I've not seen anything longer than five years. The reasons for this are that it's impossible to predict where things will be at that time. 

What's best to do? Overpay as much as you can. It may not sound much, but if you were to overpay by £50/mo then you would have a fair bit more equity built up by the time your first fix comes to an end. That opens up a few options for you. You can either continue to pay the same (again, assuming rates haven't shifted) and reduce your term, or you'll be paying less due to the fact you've got more of your loan paid off. If you're able to overpay from day one, then you'll never ""miss"" the extra money. Similarly, any bonuses you get, that kind of thing - make a lump sum payment. Many providers say that it's a minimum of £500 for lump sum payments, but this isn't actually true: They just suggest that so that you can see, visibly, what difference it makes to your overall term. Obviously, do check this. Further, also check that you can make overpayments without penalty.

Of course, there's nothing to say that even with this you won't be in the position of being unable to make your repayments. That kind of thing can happen to anyone, with even the most astute financial planning. It's just about minimising the risk.

I don't know anything about it though, so will bow to your knowledge. I was aware that Callaghan closed more pits, the fact remains that many of those that were closed by Thatcher were profitable, that they were all hemariging money is a myth. For instance there's one which was deemed uneconomical, which was taken over as a workers coop which only closed 3 or 4 years ago. The point is that there didn't need to be a fire sale, leaving communities which haven't recovered since, sink estates and all. We could have eased into a more German or Scandinavian model rather than decimating our industrial base. You're right, people have been lifted out of abject poverty, it's all relative though. There is no desire to see full employment, this suppresses wages. The jobs that do exist are increasingly at minimum wage, and increasingly part time. Productivity is higher than it has ever been, but those that are doing the work do not see as much of a return as their equivalents did say in the 50s when there was full employment. The rest of the country isn't plodding on as usual were paying for the cities mistakes , house prices aren't at a normal level, they're unaffordable even here in the provinces .

Ah here it is on Wikipedia ([Window period](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis_of_HIV/AIDS#Window_period)):

&gt; Antibody tests may give false negative (no antibodies were detected despite the presence of HIV) results during the window period, an interval of three weeks to six months between the time of HIV infection and the production of measurable antibodies to HIV seroconversion. Most people develop detectable antibodies approximately 30 days after infection, although some seroconvert later. The vast majority of people (97%) have detectable antibodies by three months after HIV infection; a six-month window is extremely rare with modern antibody testing. During the window period, an infected person can transmit HIV to others although their HIV infection may not be detectable with an antibody test.

So you could have newly acquired AIDs - walk into a donor centre - give infected blood - which wouldn't be detected during screening.

This explains why the choice of sexual lifestyle would affect risk assessment.

It also explains why the question isn't: ""do you get turned on by men"" but ""have you had sex with any men in the last year"". If you are gay but celibate I'm pretty sure you can still give blood.

I'm also pretty sure if you declare that you've had unprotected sex with a new female partner they may have grounds to refuse you, too. I don't know.

I'm not sure how much info there is on HSPS because it's a brand new course - this year's freshers are the first people doing it! Up to last year we had a course called PPS (Politics, Psychology and Sociology) but then they decided to split off Psychology as its own subject and merge the other two with the Archaeology and Anthropology course to form HSPS.

As far as I know, neither Oxford nor Cambridge offer politics on its own, at least not in the first year. In the second year and later, you get a lot more choice in modules and so you could probably do just politics from second year onwards.

I'd guess 99% of people are happy with whichever college they end up at. Personally I wanted a small college so that I'd get to know everyone in my year. That limited my choice to three (Peterhouse, Corpus and I can't remember off the top of my head which the third was) and then I was advised that Corpus is the nicest of those. However, you might want a bigger college, or you might not care about that and instead want to look at things like how well various colleges do in the specific subject you're applying for.

A couple of final things: the HSPS website is [here](http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/hsps/) and you shouldn't worry too much if the subject divisions don't line up exactly with what you want to do, there's a lot of flexibility (especially in arts or humanities subjects) and officially members of the university can attend any lectures they want.",0,1388933560,null,0,false,0,cehv2zk,t3_1ugdk1,t1_cehv2zk,t1_cehuc5u,null,1431808288,3,false,cambridge_uni,t5_2s17x,3

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"There are two elements to buying a house:

- Buy it as an investment

- Buying it as a home

Think of it like a car, there's the chance that a car will hold it's value, but there's also the *utility* you get out of using a car.

In terms of buying it as a home, there is *almost never* a bad time to buy. I suppose if you were panicking, couldn't really afford it, and went ahead and bought it anyway - that's a bad time to buy.

In terms of buying as an investment, ehhh. It's tricky. Really really tricky. My gut and everything I've learnt about investment looks at the fundamentals and I can't help but think - *this only has one way to go*. Are the next generation supposed to borrow ten times their incomes? What about after that? 

At the same time, more and more people are trying to buy houses, so the price *is* going up. Almost nobody in the UK today doesn't want to be on the property ladder, where in previous generations it was a choice some people made, with pros and cons. If everyone is doing it, there must be a reason? The root of this I feel is that everything else seems like gambling on the future. Who would risk that £10k in this climate and start a business, instead of using it as collateral to buy a house - any house? Even a shed?

For me, I feel the inverse - that the FTSE is growing strongly and I don't trust debt not to increase in price dramatically, and that signing up for a lifetime of debt for a small abode when I could just live a risk-free existence letting my wealth accumulate on the FTSE and pay my landlord (the fairly cheap) rent is quite nice. If I had kids I might not like the insecurity that comes with having a landlord and ASTs.

The same 'migration to property' happened in Japan and eventually caused a 20 year decline as everyone was stuck in upside down mortgages, and the whole economy slowed down as the debt had to be paid down. If people leaving Uni are being told they aren't going to get a promotion for 10-20 years because no business can make a good profit because the previous generation are up to their eyeballs in debt, they aren't likely to buy a house (people buy long-term assets like houses normally 'stretch' themselves as they expect their income long term will increase) - which is exactly what has been happening in Japan as the young have decided not to buy their own homes.

As a home though, there's never really a bad time to buy, unless you can't afford it.

About 101,000. That's [Less than the amount of Americans here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_migration_to_the_United_Kingdom#cite_note-2012_estimates-3) (Open the document go to tab 2.4 to compare to other nationalities.)

That's 0.1% of the population.

&gt;Did you miss the dismantling of the shanty town in London 

Yes. But given your link that was all of 50 people in what appears to be an isolated incident. 

Hardly hundreds of thousands living in shanty towns.

&gt;I have never seen Brits hang around wickes, I have never seen them wait at traffic lights to beg and pester people trying to sell papers they have taken out the bin

And I've never seen the Romanians do that, but I know plenty UK nationals who do cash in hand. Anecdotes are worthless on a national scale. 

&gt;Only 3 nationalities have a lower rate of unemployment than brits. 

Getting figures on that is difficult, but for the most part, [migrants have lower rates of unemployment than Brits](http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/characteristics-and-outcomes-migrants-uk-labour-market).

&gt;You missed 900000 people moving here?

No, but I don't see it as a problem: they work bloody hard and for the most part, many Eastern Europeans such as Poles Lithuanians and Latvians tend to integrate well, especially here in Scotland. 

&gt;Towns suddenly going from 0% Polish to 30% the pressure on school places and the surge in house prices.

That can only be in isolated places, because the overall Polish population in the UK is circa 700,000, which is approximately 1% of the population. Further the surge in house prices is down to the fucked up economy, work is concentrated in Greater London, and so people are migrating from the rest of the UK in order to find work. Land is perfectly affordable in the North of Engand, but there's no economy here. This is down to internal economic migration. Even if you shoved all the migrant workers on boats back to the EU tomorrow and closed the borders, London would still be ludicrously expensive. And probably a number of industries such as hospitality and the NHS would collapse without foreign workers.

true,demon4372,null,null,"&gt;A union using their democratic right to protest is holding a country hostage?

Firstly, today you have the right to peaceful protest.... which the strikes almost certainly weren't. Secondly, it wasn't the protests that we're holding the country hostage, it was the fact they held british industry hostage, and made them meet their demands of higher pay, and if they didn't comply they went on strike, crippling british industry. Not all the striking was bad, and much was necessary for the rights of the workers, but it got out of hand.

&gt;The union was right, we would always need more coal

Coal is a old and finite resource, the country was too dependant on it. And long term we could not rely on it. We can't just go on using on resource, because moving off it would screw over people who are invested in it. Its the same reason we now have to move away from our dependency on oil.

&gt;Thatcher wanted to decimate the NUM because they were left-wing and hated her, that's why she deserved to be hanged.

So now anyone who disagrees, and goes so far to hate that ideology that people follow, with someone else and uses their power, as the democratically elected prime minister in this case, against the people they disagree with should be hanged?

&gt;She directly caused the destruction of several communities by closing the pits

Unfortunately, its called progress, we cant just not close pits just because some people might lose their jobs. The fact the communities were destroyed was partially thatcher's fault for not helping the communities more, and partially the communities fault for in may cases being stubborn and arrogant and totally unwilling to change.

&gt;she was also directly responsible for many deaths and injuries caused by the police who thought it was a good idea to beat up protesters.

&gt;Do you have a source?

The National Grid used to have a very good section in their library regarding generation disconnections, but I can't get it to load up at the moment. The figures are all there if you can get it to work yourself. In absence of that there is [this](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v34/n17/james-meek/how-we-happened-to-sell-off-our-electricity) which mentions a few of these abuses. For another blast from the past, you might find [this document](http://www.seec.surrey.ac.uk/research/SEEDS/SEEDS62.pdf) useful. Whilst it doesn't go into details about closures, it's very explicit in bemoaning the monopolistic practices of incumbants and lack of incentives to invest. [This](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-999X.1992.tb00700.x/abstract) article by the same author is better, if you have an account. The author takes a very Adam Smithsian approach and recommends breaking up the power generation companies. This is from one the privatisation's cheerleaders, remember, and the fact that the problems inherent in power generation companies selling power to themselves for consumption was identified as a problem so long ago should tell you a great deal.

&gt;It's as bad as people talking about the evil privatised railway but don't realise/don't want to know that all of the major decisions are made by government anyway (fares, trains, routes, frequencies, new investment)

Taxpayer-funded decisions and investment leading to private profits for the rail companies is hardly a ringing endorsement for privatisation.

For an example of what I mean: I'm doing maths, and in the first year you're given the option of swapping one maths paper for the first-year physics paper. But you *don't* get that option in later years, and you're only really allowed to do that sort of crossover with physics or computer science. You can't really do a ""half one subject, half the other"", it's more like ""one subject with a smattering of other things if you want"".

And for one thing, River never communicated with the Doctor in his time stream. He hadn't entered it; it was Clara that was in there, and River could still communicate with the Doctor because Clara really was still alive to maintain the connection.

&gt;The flirtatious nature between The Doctor and Tasha is eerily similar to how he interacts with River.""

Because it's ***impossible*** for him to flirt with a different person, of course.

&gt;Tasha’s chambers in design are eerily similar to the way “The Library” appeared during Tennants run.

I don't see it, but so what if they were? The interior of the TARDIS looked eerily similar to the inside of a hospital once. And need I remind you about how people overreacted when they noticed that they reused Jenny's chair for Oswin?

&gt;The Doctor refers to Tasha as someone that has been “fighting the psychopath in her all  her life”. The only other person he’s even used that term to describe is River.

And now he's used it for Tasha. Yes. People can have similar descriptions made of them.

&gt;Tasha can fly the TARDIS rather well.

Anyone can if they're taught. Romana could fly it too.

&gt;If Amy does in fact perish at 87, then it would not be out of the realm of possibility for her still to be alive and be Clara’s grandmother.

Yes it would. That grave is there in 2012. Clara's family are in 2013. Amy is not Clara's grandmother.

So, author, if you're so convinced that Tasha is River having survived the Library, answer me this:

Why did she ask the Doctor if his body was a new one? Surely River wouldn't have forgotten the incarnation she spent most of her time with, right?

You didn't make any points, just acted victimised. Well, you did make one point: the 'flags committee' would have cost money, but given that the cost of that would pale in comparison to the effects on business by and cost of policing loyalist rioters I chose to ignore it.

As for being harder on the viler aspects of loyalism, I was talking about parades. The only way we'll ever get along well enough to have genuine and permanent peace is by phasing out parades completely. They are an insult to one community and fuel sectarianism in both communities. 

Unfortunately there weren't really any steps towards that and the unionists parties chose to remain in denial.

I'm not even saying that Tasha Lem *isn't* River Song, merely that I do not believe that she is. Moffat could be up to anything at the moment. I thought we were done with River Song entirely, but the revelation that she's returning proves that Moffat can pull one over us *still*.

I don't think she's a virtual consciousness, because the Daleks were able to turn her into a Dalek-Puppet. I don't think this could've been achieved if she were digitally projected.

I know the scene of which you speak. It was in with the ""*he doesn't like endings*"" bit. But to my mind, this is merely a nod, and not evidence enough to substantiate the claim that they are the same person.

I think the most compelling point, however, is the one I have outlined in my previous comment. It's simply out of character. She's feisty and fun-loving, as we've never been given any indication that she'd be willing to settle down as a nun. Admittedly, different incarnations of a Time Lord/Lady have different personalities, so it is not implausible that one of her incarnations would be more relaxed. However, I believe [someone correct me if I'm wrong] that we've seen all of her regenerations. The child, Mel, and River. As River, she sacrificed her remaining regenerations to allow that energy to save his life in *Let's Kill Hitler*. So she cannot regenerate any more. Alex Kingston is the final form of River Song.

Therefore, while it's a nice idea, I think it unlikely that Tasha Lem is River Song. Not impossible, but unlikely.",0,1388938670,null,0,false,0,cehwfyw,t3_1ug4al,t1_cehwfyw,t1_cehw94y,null,1431808998,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,OhWhyBother,null,null,"Yeah, Mata didn't play. But, IMHO, he is unlikely to play under Jose, especially with the current system being employed. I mean, if Jose picks Ramires to go on the right wing, rather than using Willian and Mata in tandem, things don't look rosy for the latter. I know, I have said before that neither looks fully comfortable when both (Willian and Mata) are on, but this game could have been a good opportunity to let Mata display his creative prowess.

All this season, I have felt that Mata is not a wing player and I have said as much, quite often. Yet, watching Jose keep sticking him on the wing, I have come to the sad realization that Jose probably does not want Mata in his squad. Whatever the reason - tactics or defensive work-rate or something else - Jose does not believe Juan can fit into his philosophy.

Today, for instance, could have been a good opportunity to play Juan behind the striker. Not that Derby County are a bad team - they are tearing it up in their league. However, they had been setup to defend in two banks of four and giving Juan the freedom to explore his creativity could have made the first half a lot more interesting to watch. I mean, if you are going to play two defensive mids, why not start with a creative attacking mid who is known to fashion chances out of thin air? 

For an attacking mid, Willian was appalling today, especially in the first half. Ditto for Oscar, until Hazard came on. The play picked up only when Jose subbed Hazard on for ~~Willian~~ Essien, thus shifting Willian to the right and dropping Ramires to midfield and effectively shifting into higher gear. He (probably) wouldn't have needed to make this sub had Juan been on.

Jose's first half was all about quelling Derby's left wing attacks (by using Ramires and Azpi on the right) - it seemed to work but it also dulled our attacking options all through the first half. Once Jose decided that Derby County's left wing was sufficiently exhausted, he brought on Hazard to infuse the necessary pace/creativity into the attack and it almost instantly paid dividends. Well done, Eden.

As for the strikers, I have been watching them for the past few games and it looks to me like most of their runs are designed to draw defenders away and create space for one of our attacking midfielder to run into. Watch Torres in the game today, for instance. There was a point where Hazard (or maybe Willian) had the ball on the wide right and Torres ran towards the goal but just stopped short of the 6-yard box, and pulled one of the Derby defenders towards him. It didn't result in a goal but it did make ample space for the cross. 

It seems to me Jose knows his best XI - all his rotations are simply to rest the appropriate player for the next match. As for Juan, I can only hope he gets to play one last game with Hazard and Oscar on either flank, and Torres ahead of him before he leaves.

At the moment you have to be 8 weeks in arrears to get paid direct - that safeguard may be removed, if we put that aside.

The biggest reason for rental arrears is failure to ""sign on"" or missing appointments or not informing council of changes and ""over payments"" caused by lies or mistakes.
These cause LHA to be suspended or council often asking for monies back from the landlord due to ""over-payment"".

Some subs were made pro actively and others were made reactively - there is no way to figure out which is which, especially if we were drawing at that point.

I would like to see such a comparison but I'd be wary against drawing any inferences broader than ""Did Jose's subs work?"" from such  data. 

I would especially be wary of drawing inferences about which of our subs have scored/won/lost it for us. Often, with a sub, the tactics tend to shift too. See the Norwich game, for instance. We went into a 3-5-2 of sorts and ended up scoring+winning. The same, however, didn't yield much against Everton(?) In the late stages of the game. The data is unlikely to reflect any of these tactical shifts and inferences, if made, would be 'contaminated', so to speak. :)

true,Egregiousness,null,null,"Cambridge tend to interview the majority of applicants so based on your grades you should get an interview. As far as interview prep goes make sure you really know your stuff for the subjects you're taking and anything that you mention in your personal statement is definitely fair game for questioning. You'd be surprised how many people mention a certain book or special interest in a personal statement, but then can't answer questions on it when it comes to interview. The interview is pretty much a more intense/aggressive version of how you'll be taught in supervisions so if you can show that enjoy being presented with problems in that sort of format it'll help. Don't be afraid to take your time with the questions they give you, much better to sit in silence for a few seconds (it'll feel like an eternity though) than just winging it. Also don't be afraid of asking for clarification/extra information if they ask you a question you're really not confident on.
An open application won't hurt your chances, but as someone else has already said you risk being sent to Girton which although not a disaster really is an absolute pain. I'd go for one of the central colleges, they're prettier and more convenient for shopping/clubs and the like. You'd be surprised how far a 5 minute walk can feel in Cambridge. If you're into drama I'd recommend Corpus they've got their own theater and have a strong thesp crowd at the moment.
Mention your extracuriculars in your personal statement and mention them at interview if they ask/bring it up, but I wouldn't attempt to bring them up otherwise. The interview is almost exclusively to assess your academic potential.

That's pretty unique in my mind - it's also quite obviously obscure as you won't find that tea anywhere else not even in Waitrose. 

Edits:

Ahh - It depends on what you think of as tea. I think of it as wine (vintages, countries, estates, qualities). So you will be able to find Earl Grey anywhere in the UK - and it would be good, but you probably won't be able to find this particular type. That's why I consider it obscure. 

Incidentally, that shop also has obscure teas which would meet you criteria of ""obscure"" - certain korean green teas, for example.

3:55am Pacific Standard Time. To wake up that early and lay witness to the match today was such a waste I have no words. I was super hyped to see Potts and some of the kids on the pitch, all youth squad? Okay, I'll give it a try. Wait.... no. I realize that THIS Cup might not mean as much as it did, and I realize we have a different Cup match against a MUCH BETTER squad than Forest... but for fuck's sake 5-0?! Now Sam, I've been a steadfast supporter of yours over the first part of this season; hoping for some sort of epiphany on your part and some much needed stability in our club. You're really letting everyone down.

In closing, GET YOUR HEAD OUT!!! Everyone can see it except you and it's becoming depressing waking up just to see miserable defeats and lackluster, pickup level football. If the tactics, team selection (Ahem... Nolan, your letter is in the mail, assbag), and overall style of play do not improve then I'm sorry, but I must pull a mulligan on my support of you.... douchebag,

true,ruizscar,cnty-expat,South America,"*But surely our major authoritative media, such as the BBC, are more or less neutral in their reporting and analysis?*

&gt; We believe that media claims to 'neutrality' are a deception that serve to hide systematic pro-corporate bias. 'Neutrality' most often means 'impartially' reporting dominant establishment views, while ignoring or marginalising dissent. In reality it is not possible for journalists to be neutral: regardless of whether we do or do not overtly express our personal opinion, that opinion is always reflected in the facts we choose to highlight or ignore.

&gt; While Media Lens seeks to correct for some of the worst excesses of corporate media distortions as honestly as possible, our concern is not to affect some spurious 'objectivity', but to engage with the world to do whatever we can to reduce suffering and to resist the forces that seek to subordinate human well-being to profit. We do not believe that passively observing human misery without attempting to intervene constitutes 'neutrality'. Nor do we believe that 'neutrality' can ever be deemed more important than doing all in our power to help others.

&gt; The performance of the BBC is typified by former political editor, Andrew Marr. In 2001, Marr declared:

Near enough all human institutions are bizarre when considered from a distance. If you went back to the primacy of our species (anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 years ago) and were able to communicate with our ancestors, they would think concepts such as the rule of law, written language, written contracts, government, representative government, democracy, money or a civil court were very strange. Indeed before these things evolved many disputes would be solved with violence, [leading to a staggeringly high homicide rate when weighed against even the 20th century]( http://reason.com/blog/2012/07/21/steven-pinker-on-the-decline-of-violence). 

&gt; Karl Marx described early society as “primitive communism” because we hunted, gathered and consumed collectively, and the basic family unit operates as a commune. We’re constantly told that war and greed are natural, but as I pointed out to you a few weeks ago, the last time I hit anybody or anybody hit me, I was drunk, and that is most people’s experience.

One thing that would not be unfamiliar to them would be the concept of property, and between and in tribes people would frequently compete with each other for competition of resources, including land, food and women. War and greed *are* natural, and indeed it is artificial institutions that should be credited with restraining these impulses.

Why?

""Margin-call, gentlemen,"" to quote Trading Places. If you live in a fantasy world where house prices only go up (i.e. you've never heard of a country called the USA, or Ireland) then having little or no deposit is fine. But if the housing market slips 10% better to sell and get out with *some* equity - than end up owing another 5% on your house - leaving you in a debt circle you'll never escape (can't sell because it won't pay off the mortgage).

Hopefully that made sense. If house prices go down then you can *still sell* if you get back any of your deposit at all. But if the prices go down *more* than your initial deposit then you *can't* sell because you *won't* have enough to pay off the mortgage. Legally you're fucked.

---

**Example**

House cost £100,000. Your deposit £20,000 (20%). You owe the bank £80,000. House value goes down 10% to £90,000. You sell - pay back the bank £80,000 - and you're left with £10,000. Hurts but you were able to sell.

House cost £100,000. Your deposit £5,000 (5%). You owe the bank £95,000. House value goes down 10% to £90,000. You want to sell - but you'll only get back £90,000 and can't discharge the mortgage because you need another £5,000 - which you don't have. You are forced to continue paying a mortgage and cannot sell no matter what (maybe no more jobs in your area, but too bad, you can't sell and move to another area). Perhaps house prices are going to continue to go down - but too bad, you can't sell. You're locked into that property for the length of the mortgage (25 years).",0,1388943888,null,0,1388944078,0,cehy8vj,t3_1ugddc,t1_cehy8vj,t1_cehy4nw,null,1431809742,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,TJP343,null,null,"Disagree with the assessment of the first goal. He mentions Chiriches doesn't step and get tight to Gnabry, which is the correct decision. Gnabry initially gets on the ball and Walcott is being covered by both centerbacks, that's the job of the centerbacks against a lone striker.

It's a combination of Rose not marking Gnabry tight enough, a lack of a holding mid to cover the space in front of the defense, Bentaleb is also not in a deep enough central position and Walker is stuck in a 2v1 outwide because Lennon has not tracked back. Walker's choice was always going to be wrong, but no fault of his own however, he had too much to do alone.

It's a situation you would expect to see against Arsenal when you play two in midfield.

Edit: if Chiriches leaves Dawson 1v1 with Welbeck, Gnabry slips it to Walcott and he's in. Walcott has Dawson beat for pace and position relative to the ball. Chiriches can't leave Dawson.

Though I agree that you can rent out a property - the true risk is being *locked in*. That's the real danger. If your area begins to become undesirable then you want the ability to get out. You can only do that if you have some positive equity remaining in the property. Lose that and it's a nightmare for the greater portion of your life.

Consider Hughes coming from a club with extensive scouting reports on most top player across Europe at Man City, remarking that there was practically no scouting system in place at Loftus Road. Consider Mourinho taking one look at the Harlington training ground during Chelsea's need for a replacement while their own was being redeveloped, and writing it off as unsuitable. The last three years must have gone some way to improving this...we know that the new training ground is on its way, at least. In an age where we aren't going to be wheeling out Rangers fans as players, we need to improve the infrastructure as much as possible to foster professionalism and create and attractive working environment from top to bottom.

Despite Kolarov's improvement and loyalty to Richards we need young full backs to compete and cover.   

In the middle of the Park we need to have more better/less injury prone cover for Yaya and Fernandinho.   I also feel Yaya needs some competition to improve his consistency.   

In the creative/wide player category I think we have the best foursome in the league.  Silva, Nasri, Navas and Milner.   With Lopes on the verge this continues to be our strongest position now and into the immediate future.  

Up front we are also set.   As much as Dzeko frustrates it will be hard to find a replacement of his calibre willing to sit on the bench behind Aguero and Negredo.   Jovetic will be a good player if he recovers from injury.    I am not as high on Guidetti as others, having seen him play in person a lot, so bringing through another youngster soon seems imperative.   

Under the auspices of players who might be available, be English (because thats rumored to be a buying point for City) or German (because we need more Germans) its Luke Shaw at LB, Benedikt Howedes at CB, Lars Bender or Ilkay Gundogan in midfield and Adam Lallana if we need another attacking midfielder

News and information are of vital importance in those circumstances and it costs us a pittance to provide this service. The BBC has correspondents and contacts in more places than any other broadcaster, it is the world leader in this field.

* not so great companions in Martha.

...right of the bat, what was wrong with Martha? She's my favorite companion, personally. You seem to have taken it for granted that everyone doesn't like her.

* flat character development in Martha

Again, no evidence given. Martha had much better development than anyone else, in my opinion. She had a crush on the Doctor and traveled with him for something like two years, and over that time realized that he was never, ever going to reciprocate, so she did the only thing she could do, which was leave.

* dodgy character development in Midnight

people are stupid when their lives are in danger. That's the point of the episode. It was wonderfully written and amazingly done.

* When we first met Amy she was a bloody stripper trying to hit on the Doctor. Then she became the typical girl companion fawning over the Doctor. Then she became a fairly unique companion in that she is one of the very, very few companions who was willing to say no to the Doctor and choose her partner over him. She chose to spend the rest of her time with the man she truly loved instead of following the Doctor. How can anyone say that Amy is a cardboard cutout of a character? Her character progression has been some of the most defined over time of ANY companion and it doesn't happen from one episode to the next.

I'm not arguing this. Amy does change over time. She changes a lot. And there is no reason for it that I can see. She starts out having trouble deciding between the Doctor and Rory, hell she wants to have sex with him the night before their wedding! Then she becomes the incredibly devoted, loving partner. Then there was that one episode that they got divorced but it was all fixed by the end of the episode... Yeah, she changes, but it's not for reasons that real people change. She changes to fit the plot's requirements.

* In the short space of time we've had with Clara, we've already seen some development in the Impossible Girl arc and now that is finished, it's simply a human companion travelling with the Doctor exploring Space and Time - it can only improve from here on out.

I really hope so. But Clara doesn't seem to have a consistent personality beyond ""spunky"". Like Amy, it changes as the plot requires. At first this was easily understandable as she was an entirely different person the first two times we saw her, but since we got to Clara prime?

* Then we get to the scriptwriting and specifically, Time of the Doctor.

Now, Time of the Doctor wasn't great, but I think it was about as good as it could have been considering it was supposed to be a whole season. But the problem with Moffat's scriptwriting (in my opinion) is mainly two things. One, it's too rushed a lot of the time, which is because he's limited to one-part episodes. Two, he leaves things to be answered later, which is okay, but he doesn't answer them sufficiently in the meantime. Lets look at the finales of the past few seasons.

Season 5: the TARDIS explodes, and the unleashed Time Vortex destroys the universe. A fail safe in the TARDIS saved the area around it - Earth, keeping it in stasis. The Pandorica still contained some molecules from the old universe, though, which let the TARDIS rebuild the entire universe from those molecules memories? Okay, it's Doctor Who. All well and good, but... who blew up the TARDIS?

Season 6: River refuses to kill the Doctor at Lake Silencio, and breaking the fixed point in time screws up the timeline. They fix it by using the Tesselecta, and... um. Why was River trying to kill the Doctor again? Because there was that big conspiracy which was working with the Silence, and we still don't understand why they want the Doctor dead.

Season 7: The GI goes in the Doctors timeline, which lets him mess with all of his timeline. Clara follows the GI, so she can fix what's messed up. The Doctor goes in too, so he can save Clara, but... uh oh! He warned Clara and the GI that if they entered, they wouldn't be able to get out, *ever!* Now the Doctor and Clara are stuck in the Doctor's timeline! Except, no?

All of that got wrapped up in the Time of the Doctor (except for exiting the Doctor's timestream), but it wasn't satisfying at the time for it to still be unknown who blew up the TARDIS, it was still unknown why the conspiracy wanted the Doctor dead. When something is left unresolved and it looks like it's never going to be addressed again, that's... not good writing.

* Most of all, he gave us two incarnations of a character that wasn't the Doctor.

Fuck that. You said it yourself, it made sense in the context of the Time War. And it definitely was the Doctor we knew and loved because we all knew him and we all loved him.

""I think a year is realistic.


It sounds quick but you've got to remember that the show isn't some kind of 'Famous 5' deal - it is a group of young offenders forced to spend a short amount of time picking up dog shit and putting it into a bin. As someone said before, their probation work was initially for roughly 2 months - then they were put back on probation when Rudy was brought into the show. Then even newer members were brought in for their stints, and so on.
At some point, the 'former' group met the 'latter' group - Jess and Finn met Curtis and Rudy for instance. You can't expect community service to go on for a year or more because community service is meant to ideally be quick rehab then the offenders get jobs and become part of the community. There are too many young offenders around to keep 5 or so on for a year. When you think about it this way, only a year can make sense compared to 3 or 5 like someone mentioned below. If new offenders briefly meet old offenders, it is like adding on another immediate 2 month stint to the previous stint - there was no 'One year Later', sequel-like transition. In fact I'd go as far as to say that less than a year could be possible, but over 5 seasons, maybe not.


You can also go for a basic 5 seasons x 8 episodes (i think there were 8, maybe 6) = 40. when representing each episode as a week of real time which is a fair way to view it you get to 40 weeks. Add in breaks for when people are off of service like at the start of season 3 and it makes sense.


In fact, im surprised that people cant get their head around this because this can be answered when you look at the show's plot simply - the time travel stuff on the other hand is pretty flawed.""

By the way, last time I posted this a lot of the American audience didn't understand how British community service runs - in America, I heard you have a set amount of time, and it is like you have to meet a quota before the year is up, so you can spread it up over time.

AKA HIS IMPROVEMENTS.

Also, what?
Was that point not clear? People are still Manchester United fans regardless if they lose or not, they still stand by their players. Forgive me for not providing clearer context.

We're seeing the same thing with Bitcoin. Right now it looks invincible - everybody thinks they should have bought a year ago - but if it crashes tomorrow everybody will think they were so smart for not buying in.

I bought in thinking they'd depressed as far as they would go! Then they kept coming down, down, and down.

She thought she might even dial her age down gradually to freak people out, not that she would just not age at all. We don't know the method Tasha used; it was probably another form of genetic engineering. Liz Ten didn't age either because her body clock was decelerated and no one considered her being River.

Our ideal situation is to see who performs the best out of our three strikers. Right now it's Torres. We have to give Demba Ba a chance first but as of now he's not receiving any (He performed well in the FA cup so I'm sure he'll be starting more for this tournament).

I was surprised when Fox got given MOTM as he seemed nowhere near sharp enough. Although his distribution was good. 

RVW also looked a little absent and didn't do much right, but that's expected with him returning to match fitness. However, there were a few glimpses of what he may be capable of and he would have scored if not for a fantastic save from Stockdale.

My MOTM was Snodgrass, not just because he scored but because he looked like the only player first team player on the team who was up for it and worked hard until the end. Felt as if he had been told he needed to prove why he's a starter.

Torres open miss against Manchester City? People want him sold. Oscar playing poorly? Sell him. Mata playing poorly? Sell him.

THEN when the players are performing well they say they were die-hard fans from the beginning. Criticizing players is okay, joking about them is okay as well. People do it all the time, I was just merely stating that people think we're plastic fans because of our behaviour.

On the other hand, Torres has been with us for few years and will still remain with us. He has been under-performing since 2010. Why blame them for giving up on Torres? Some fans, including me used to blame the midfield for not supplying good service. But, after all the chances that gone by begging. Is it ridiculous to come to conclusion that no good pass can revive Torres to be among the top strikers? He will never score anything close to 20 league goals in a season. Every time he scores a goal, some fans say ""he is back"" and then he goes back to hibernation. Even when Lukaku comes back next season, we will still need another top striker next to him. Torres, Eto'o and Ba can't help us win major trophies. How many big European teams are solely relying on their midfielders to score goals?

true,Vetras92,null,null,"Like i said. If you look at them separately you can easily refute everyone. 
But that there are so many ""possible!"" connections with River lead me to believe that Moffat plans something with it.

Just for the first argument. Sure that TARDIS showed her. But she implied she had such a good understanding of the TARDIS because she was ""the child of the TARDIS"" in another episode. I would guess for everyone else learning to fly a TARDIS wouldn't be ""always easy"".

My personal ""therory"" at the moment is:
She is River. Her virtual consciousness is put into a artificial body, that simply doesn't age, because it's artificial and she wanted it that way.
So they could put her as the ""most perfect companion"" for the Doctor, just to kill her of in a very dramatic scene later.
She choose a new name to be able to lead the papal mainframe.
Because ""the universe"" (teselecta etc) knows River Song she had to change her name. Her motive was to ""create herself"" indirectly, so that she would meet the doctor

The thing is. Their relationship is even from the doctors perspective very deep. He even gave her the TARDIS key (he had that backup plan but even then he must have trusted her to not immediatly go in there). And since we'll not see that past, where they build up that relationship I guess they will explain it with: It was River all along, so we don't need to explain it more.

That when you have uncontrolled immigration it places pressure on services - as a basic principle.  That's not controversial.  It's the other stuff the Powell said that was controversial.

In fact, you can get any politician to agree in part with anybody from Stalin to Pinochet, from Gandhi to Mao, by playing these silly games.  Farage even argues for NET IMMIGRATION, only that it should be controlled and the controls should be in Westminster.  That's it.

However, the problem is. If you live in Cornwall what do you do for a living? You either work in retail, which is alright in Truro but you won't earn more than minimum wage. In places like Camborne and Redruth jobs like that will be few and far between, and the hours will be low and pay will be shit. Tourist industry is all good and well but its only really a 3 month in the year industry

When I lived in Cornwall between starting my job in Portsmouth after working in Birmingham, best job I could find was in IT for the NHS and was actually pretty sweet, even then it wasn't much more than minimum wage. Ironically, there is a lot of brown field land that industry could use, but its bad links to the rest of the UK will never help Cornwall.

Why not?

People had the homes they needed, they had more tenant security than they have today. 

Tories talk about home ownership like it's *obviously* a good thing, without ever actually bothering to explain why.

I would describe *housing security* as ""obviously a good thing"", but ownership is not the only way to achieve that. Especially since [home ownership is now at its lowest since Thatcher was in office.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/borrowing/mortgages/9856095/Home-ownership-falls-to-lowest-level-since-1987.html)

I would say that it's ""obviously a good thing"" for people to own large capital assets if they want housing security in a dog-eat-dog world, in which your wealth is largely dictated by the circumstances of your birth. But if we reject the premise that that's the kind of world we want to live in then housing security can be provided in other ways.

By selling off this massive national asset, Thatcher took a step which is very difficult to reverse. Housing security is no longer ensured by the existence of that public asset, but is subject to the short-term whims of the economy, and of politicians meddling in it. 

You can see this yourself, from your own figures - home ownership was at an all time high 20 years ago, now it's declined to an all-time low, again. The difference is that renters no longer have the assurance of a tenancy for life, as they did as council tenants, and landlords can evict you with a few weeks' notice, just because it happens to be profitable.  So we probably have more evictions now than ever before, and more people have less assurance about being able to live in their home in the future. 

It's great that your family bought a home - whoopie doo, my family bought 3! - but speaking from my own experience, a BTL landlord can evict you with only a few weeks notice, and it's shit. Council tenants had far better rights, until Thatcher's sell off left us so low on housing stock that we had to strip them of their housing security.

I would probably not choose to go back to government-constructed, -owned and -managed housing stock, but I would much prefer to see a third of the UK population living in homes owned by NFP housing associations, with one or two national associations to standardise the application process and manage standards. 

Compared, for example, to the way privatisation has allowed multiple operators to manage the national rail network, or for us to buy our phone and electricity from different ""suppliers"" on a shared infrastructure, the council house sell off was rather naive neo-liberalism. It turns out that consumers don't always act in their own ideal rational self-interest - I'm pretty sure that economists could have told Thatcher that even back in 1980.

Not only that, but the sell off learned nothing from history - did the teachers at Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School allow young Maggie to sleep through her classes, that she thought that the Enclosures Acts were a good and fair thing for those who were dispossessed? 

&gt; I'd argue that this is a good thing, … for those like my family …  but also for society as a whole.

Except you don't, you just express an opinion, without bothering to state any arguments.

The rest of us can only wonder and assume, why you might have arrived at this conclusion. ",0,1388951732,null,0,1388966830,0,cei1law,t3_1udrhq,t1_cei1law,t1_cehs9fs,null,1431811424,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

You cut off half of my comment to make it wrong, I said that if he is earning £36,000 per year with a £16,000 bonus he would be well into the 40% tax bracket. The mistake in my comment was that I miscounted the amount of months that had already happened this tax year, I was counting 10 (£3,000 * 10 = £30,000, + £16,000 = £46,000, greater than the £42,000 limit).

&gt; That only makes sense if you are going to up them by 40% at least. Pension tax relief means your tax rate is added on to your pension by the government, so it makes zero sense to pay more at 20% and get less for it.

I don't understand what you mean by this?

If your total pay for the year pre-tax is £45,000 that means you would have £3,000 (assuming normal tax code) that has 40% tax due on it. 40% of £3,000 is £1200, so that extra £3,000 in earning only provides you with £1,800 extra cash.

If instead you contributed an extra £3,000 into your pension (therefore having **no** tax liability at 40%) the government would match it with a 20% contribution (+£600) meaning you now have an extra £3600 in your pension, instead of £1800 in your bank account. That's a huge financial incentive to stay out of the upper tax bracket by contributing the extra into your pension.

That's like blaming your employer for making you redundant after you got yourself into tons of credit card debt and bought that new car, rather than yourself for choosing to spend money you didn't have.

London is a major centre in global finance. Its activities are regulated by the UK government. I suspect that the FSA (which has been criticised for its ineptness and has now been killed), which Labour set up, had a bit to do with the problem.

&gt;  Labours financial plan had it's issues, but was sound up until the credit collapse. 

A sound financial plan? You mean year after year of constant deficit (after they stopped following Conservative plans after 2001)? It's surely not hard to think that maybe spending more than you're taking in, for a decade, is not going to end well?

&gt;  If you're going to blame them for the last 2 years of their time in office, then you must credit them for the first 11 or so. 

I don't know what there is to credit them for. Throwing money that they didn't have at everything in the hopes that it'd make everything better? That seems to be all that they've done. Plus lots more surveillance and authoritarianism. And ridiculous house prices.

Rubbish (and expensive) public transport means getting anywhere without a car is a chore (a half hour drive is a 2 hour bus journey from just outside Redruth to Helston). Shopping is harder because the shops are all further away, the nearest aldi is about 8 miles away, Tesco about 10 and I have a sneaking suspicion that the nearest asda is on the other side of the county. If you want to go for a meal somewhere or watch a movie or something, you have to drive, so no drinking. And cabs get *really* expensive. Positives: You feel safe all the time. Living in a village is like having a big family sometimes, you can get to know everyone nearby. It's great if you enjoy the lack of sound (from roads etc). When you go back to the city to see relatives or friends you really tell how polluted, noisy and bright they are. At night when it isn't cloudy I can see *far* more stars and stuff than in the city, and also the silence you get is great. Also riding your bike, is awesome fun because there's very little traffic and more green stuff if you fall off. You can also go out and enjoy walks through fields and stuff like that. I think it really depends on what sort of person you are. If you get lonely easily or aren't outdoorsy at all then the country is not really for you. You have to be patient because it takes time to do things that it would take moments to do in a city.

&gt;Linda wants to know – do you want to be able to see hardcore pornography?

No she doesn't. She wants to know if you'd like to activate the Parental Filter. 

Suggesting that 'Linda' wants to know if you'd like to watch porn is the same as suggesting the guy who cleans your car wants to know if you go dogging, when he asks what flavour air-freshener you'd like. 

&gt;After an outcry, the company quickly changed the wording on its website, 

After an issue was discovered, it was fixed. What's the problem here?

&gt;but it is not clear that more than the wording has been changed.

In other words ""We don't know but we're still going to get angry about it!""

&gt; the internet has no ""social or moral framework"". Well, neither does a library. 

No, but it does have age and content appropriate sections. You wouldn't find a copy of '50 Shades of Grey' in the kid's section. 

They have children's areas, pre-school areas, young-adult areas, etc because people understand that maybe there are ages where certain things are appropriate and other things are not. 

I've also got problems with continued use of:

&gt;The government's filter - Cameron's porn filter 

Especially when later:

&gt;government has given private firms permission to decide what websites we may and may not access.

So which is it?! Is it the government's filter, is Cameron himself choosing which sites we can look at, or is it the evil corporations?

Firstly, no one is blocking anything. It's an *optional* filter. 

The ISPs are setting the filters themselves, it's nothing to do with government, who have no control over the content that is blocked. 

&gt;The public gets no say over what political content will now be blocked, 

Yes they do, it's an optional filter. It also gives the options of utilising whitelists. So you can utilise the filter, and also choose certain sites to be allowed. 

&gt;just as we had no say over whether we wanted such content blocked at all.

 Yes we do, it's an *optional* filter.

&gt;Records of opt-in software will, furthermore, make it simpler for national and international surveillance programmes to track who is looking at what sort of website. 

How is this any different from normal? ISPs have always been able to see what websites you visit. 

&gt;Just because they can doesn't mean they will, of course, but...

But... they might murder some kittens, or drown babies. ""But"" is scaremongering. 

They're not going to watch Joe Bloggs because he hasn't got a filter, because they know that anyone worth their salt with something to hide will actually *activate* the filter and find other ways around it. 

The filter is not a flag to nefarious activities. To use it as such would be ridiculous. 

The author of this article is either massively ill-informed (willfully), or is deliberately scaremongering. Neither of which is acceptable. 

The sensationalist style in which it's written would be at home in the Daily Mail, and the strawman arguments are shameful. 

Let's just clarify: 

• The filter is not a block, it's a filter. 

• The filter is optional. It's opt-out for new accounts, and opt-in for existing accounts. So unless you've had a 'phonecall from Linda' and turned the filter on, your issue with reddit will not be because of the filter. However, if you *do* decide to change ISP you *will* have to turn off the filter which is as easy as clicking a big button during set-up. 

•  It's not a Government filter. They have no control over what sites are and are not filtered. The ISPs themselves are implementing it. 

• Use or non-use of the filter does not make it any easier/harder to track your nefarious online activities.

From the HMRC website:

&gt; Usually **your employer takes the pension contributions from your pay before deducting tax** (but not National Insurance contributions). You only pay tax on what's left. So whether you pay tax at basic, higher or additional rate you get the full relief straightaway.

[source](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/incometax/relief-pension.htm)

If what you're saying is true, that it's pointless to increase your pension contributions to avoid paying more tax, can you explain the example that I posted? That if you're earning £45,000 you would be £1800 better off (in raw £) if you contribute £3000 to a pension to stay out of the 40% tax bracket?

If you earn £50,000 and have no pension you pay tax on £50,000. If you earn £50,000 and pay £10,000 into a pension, you pay tax on £40,000. Therefore, a pension reduces your taxable income, ergo it will ""reduce your earnings for the sake of tax"".

What you're saying contradicts what I was told by the person the company I work for brought in to discuss my pension with me, I'm a 40% tax payer and I have salary sacrifice. Salary sacrifice reduces my **income** and in return my employer contributes extra direct to my pension (because they save on national insurance, and so do I, because I have lower income) and pension contributions reduce my **taxable** income.

There's talk about a fear factor and attitude missing at United and that's definitely part of it, but the incoherent strategy is too. I was pointing out to people after their loss to Spurs that the manager with no real strategy triumphed over the manager trying to play two competing strategies, and I think that's a problem in the make-up of their team that's become more pronounced all the time - they play 4-2-3-1 in order to control the central midfield from deep, but then they use that control to put the ball out to the wings. The team is set up to contain and play through the central area ahead of the opponent's box, but by trying to switch from that to wing-play (which is pretty inefficient a strategy in itself, but that's a different conversation) they end up with a situation where they're either trying to play through to a single isolated striker or they're crossing to a single target in the box, since the midfield players and wide players are looking to do completely different things. The striker's also left in the middle unsure of what to expect. The midfield don't have teammates looking to make runs through the middle or help them work the ball up through the middle because too many are looking to get wide, and subsequently they aren't racing up to the middle of the box to attack crosses because that leaves a gaping hole behind them. That's how they were able to dominate possession but not come close to actually dominating the game.

Amy went back to 1938 with Rory. They adopted Anthony Williams in 1949. He's 64 years old when he met his grandfather. If Amy and Rory died at 82 and 87 respectively, and they were mid to late 20s when they left the doctor, then they died in the early 90- early 2000s. 

By all accounts, Clara's dinner party took place after Smart Phones were invented. 

Clara's Gran is not Amy Pond. Unless you want to consider Arton Energy as the reason why she lived past her death date. If she did, why would she not live in America with her grandkids and great grandkids.

* Supply of mortgages
* Demand for housing (population growth, BTL, Foreign investment)
* House building
* High rent
* Interest rates

The government is doing all it can to keep mortgage money flowing.  While the banks were told to be more cautious they were also told to keep lending.  This is unlikely to change unless the bottom drops out the market, as long as people can find a 10-20% deposit.  Even then, it will just slow up the housing market like we saw post-2008.

Demand is high; high rents are pushing anyone with money to invest into property.  The population is growing.

We build a pitiful number of new homes, and the homes we do build are the [smallest in europe](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22152622).  If I was being cynical I'd say this was a deliberate move to keep prices up.  A great number of voters are now property owners, so few are going to lobby for more supply.

I've had to move a few times for work, and no matter where I go, nice houses that come up for rent vanish off the market within one or two days.  Rents aren't going to come down unless the supply magically increases.  Can't see how that would happen.

Interest rates are the only big monster here.  A great number of people are mortgaged up to the hilt.  Too many people got 125% mortgages and jumped on the equity withdrawal bandwagon.  If the interest rate rises slowly, then it will slow price rises a bit.  There would need to be a 90s style shock of 10-15% to really shake it up, however that was caused by the ejection of the pound from the ERM.  So unless something causes a major spike in interest rates, that's not going to do much either.

true,ImInMediaYeah,null,null,"Since I'm revising for the Personal Tax exam right now, so I'll use your post to do some public revision and hopefully come up with something useful for you :)

First, it's your income from 6 April 2013 to 5 April 2014 that's relevant. So your £42k for 2013 isn't the number that really matters.

Second, it looks like you'll be over the Basic Rate Band, which means you (or your accountant) will need to submit a Tax Return. Let HMRC know!

Third, for the sake of argument, assuming £42k will be for the whole take year, here's a quick computation: 

Gross income £42,000

Less: Personal Allowance (£9,440)

Taxable Income £32,560  &lt;- That means only £550 will be above the 20% Basic Rate Band!

£32,010 x 20% = £6,402
£550 x 40% = £220

Tax Liability[Sum of above] = £6,622

Then you deduct amounts taxed at source including what tax was paid by PAYE. This gives your Tax Payable, which likely won't be a very large number.

Hope this helps! I'm sure other, properly qualified people will leave comments pointing out the flaws, but that's ok! I am revising this, after all :)

Sterling: He was the player with the most opportunities, but the least conversions, yes he did score a goal but he should have scored many many more.


Luis Alberto: Played very well in the hole. Although he didn't test the keeper many times, he was a nuisance for Oldham with his passes. He controlled the tempo from the attacking mid position and dictated our attack. He came near scoring a screamer if it wasn't for a fantastic save from the Oldham keeper.

true,rzam,lfc68,,"It depends on a number of factors. Sturridge played on the right wing for Chelsea, and it's pretty well known that he didn't enjoy that very much. Going into this year, I thought Liverpool's best formation would consist of Coutinho playing behind Sturridge, with Rodgers utilizing Suarez's versatility and playing him wide on either the left or right flank.

At this point, though, it would just be dumb to move Suarez wide. The man's been the best player the world this season operating through the middle, and it's pretty obvious he's the fulcrum for everything we do from that position. It's Messi-esque; everything on the pitch revolves around him, whether he drops deep and creates opportunities for others or functions as the target for chances created by the likes of Coutinho, Henderson, Sterling and the rest of the team. And like Messi -- who Barca realized long ago would be wasted out on the flank -- it would just be ridiculous and detrimental for the team to force Suarez to adjust to what we want to do, and not adjust the team to what Suarez does best.

At the same time, Sturridge is probably our best player not named Suarez, and he also wants to play through the middle -- and rightfully so, seeing how it's his best position. I think there are three logical options:

1) Revert to 3-5-2. You all already know what this entails, and I think it's safe to say this isn't a preferable option. 

2) Play 4-4-2, using either a flat midfield (much like City do) or a diamond 1-2-1/3-1 (presumably with Lucas holding, two of Gerrard/Allen/Henderson ahead of him and Coutinho as the *trequartista* behind Suarez and Sturridge). A lot of people on this sub have been suggesting some sort of diamond in the midfield, as though this is FIFA and it would obviously work if we use it because hey, all our guys would be in their natural positions! Well, this isn't FIFA, not to mention the fact that, to my knowledge, Brendan Rodgers has never given the slightest indication that he sees a midfield diamond as a viable option for this team. I just don't think he likes it. If he did, surely we would have seen some incarnation of it played by now, and that just hasn't been the case. At least we say Brendan play three at the back vs. Everton in the derby last season; we've never seen him play 4-1-2-1-2/4-3-1-2 (which are virtually the same formation), and I don't see him starting now. He's probably put off by the lack of width -- and seeing how any width in such a formation would come from the fullbacks, and we don't have the strongest/most reliable fullbacks in general at this point, I can understand why. As for a flat 4-4-2, well, it's incredible that City's been able to get away with it this season. It probably has something to do with the energy provided by Yaya and Fernandinho in the center of the park, which the likes of Gerrard and Lucas certainly don't provide. Besides, Rodgers has spoken at length about how he quite clearly prefers having at least three players in midfield, which a flat 4-4-2 obviously doesn't entail.

3) OP's option of a 4-3-3, potentially with Sturridge at RW. Sure, this wouldn't have Sturridge playing in his preferred position as a center forward. But I think it could work, and is also the option Rodgers is most likely to use once Sturridge is back. 

First, it's Rodgers' preferred formation, and would maintain Suarez as the team's primary striker and fulcrum around which we build everything. Then there's the critical fact that Sturridge would be playing RW in a 4-3-3 next to Luis Suarez, and **not Fernando Torres**, as he was at Chelsea. It's quite obvious that Suarez and Torres are remarkably different players, and playing next to either one comes with a different set of demands. Torres, particularly in his Chelsea career, has been your by-the-book, conventional no. 9, for the most part -- the kind of player who will statically float around the penalty area, waiting for service from midfield playmakers and wingers. He consumes space; he needs it to operate, and he needs to be the primary option within that space. Suarez is completely different, he *vacates* space, is constantly on the move, and once he gets the ball, he's looking for other options. Just look at how many opportunities Raheem Sterling has had on the right wing for us over the past several games (not to mention Coutinho on the left, though he's scuffed nearly all of them of fired them into the stands). That's all thanks to Suarez, who demands so much attention from opposing defenders and whose movement is so irrepressible that the likes of Sterling, Coutinho and Henderson have been left with acres of space at times, even against City and Chelsea. Suarez doesn't need conventional wingers and playmakers to provide him with service; he'll take the game by the scruff and create his own chances, or create them for others.

That's why I think Sturridge would have a brilliant time on the wing, playing off Suarez. Sturridge is incredible quick and loves cutting in on his left foot, and will have tons of space to do so. He won't need to focus on providing service into the box for Luis, as he did for Nando; he can play little one-twos around the box with him, or get on the end of flick-ons from Luis when Suarez drops deep to get the ball, utilizing that space behind. I think the best parallel would be Edinson Cavani at PSG, who has taken to that right-sided forward role in a 4-3-3 brilliantly. In turn, the Artist Known as Zlatan has been in the form of his life, firmly established as the focal point of the PSG attack from his preferred, center forward position.

The thing about Cavani is, he's an incredibly selfless player. That's what will be needed from Sturridge, and that's what will ultimately be the biggest question when he returns. He appears to have made great strides in this regard since he's been at Liverpool, particularly when considering his (perhaps unjustified) reputation while at City and Chelsea. Then again, he's said himself that the fact he's been given a chance at Liverpool in his preferred position, as a no. 9, has been the biggest reason for his career's renaissance.

Whether he's able to adjust to such a role could determine how far up the table we finish this season.",0,1388955690,null,0,false,0,cei3f4j,t3_1uh7et,t1_cei3f4j,t3_1uh7et,null,1431812260,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

During 2004-2007 Lisburn attracted a lot of people who wanted to fuck Christine Bleakley in those ads and decided it was a great place that was 'mixed' (according to wiki) and its also a decent commute from Belfast... That beeatch lied.. its a shithole, but it is only £20 from Belfast on a night out.... the people who work in Belfast dont really do anything more than 'sleep' in Lisburn... so its soul is a bunch of geriatrics going to the banks or the 'sell your gold' or 'payday loans' shops on the main street.

Been here 5 years and i've never wanted to go to a pub in the town, i'd prefer the non-protection-moneyed pubs in Belfast (or less obvious).

Degrees are made out of 'modules', you have to complete a certain amount of modules to get your degree.

I also have a friend who studies Computer Science which is made up of the same modules, however it isn't until the second year that our courses are different and even then he can choose some of my modules.

Some courses allow optional modules, this is where you get to pick your own modules (this is done through a university system, not UCAS and is normally done during the enrolment process) but some courses set modules for you without any swapping. 

The other type of course/degree is joint honours, I don't study one of these so I don't know too much but from what I have been told you get to pick two subjects and study both.

Being realistic, most first time buyers are in their 30's. At the rate you're going you will be able to afford a first home in a few years, way ahead of the average first time buyer.

My advice would be to stay at home as long as you can stand. It is extremely difficult to acquire a deposit while paying rent and bills, and with a salary less than around 22k there is no chance you would be able both to save and live.

My personal situation:

- rent £350 (half of the £700 per month rent on the house)

- council tax - £80

- bills inc phone and internet - £180

- transport for work etc - £150

- food - £125

- fun, clothes, hair, few pints, girlfriend etc - £300 (per month)

total outgoings = £1185 per month, living in Birmingham.

If you can't stand living at home any longer, maybe consider renting with a friend. Sharing a rented house makes everything cheaper, but if you do your sums you'll still find you can't save and rent on your current salary. It comes down to how important owning a house it to you. It really isn't a necessity, and for most people of our generation it won't be a reality until much later in their lives.

true,xMajestik,null,null,"Firstly, Um... I didn't say they were good enough, I specifically just said we should see who we should keep towards the end of the season. We shouldn't let Torres go because out of the three he has shown more potential. Lukaku has netted 9 goals in the PL so far and he's only 20 years old. Only four people are ahead of him in turns of goals and he's the youngest out of them. Our long term striker will be Lukaku and people are already saying many positive things about him. He just needs to mature in experience first.

Secondly, we've been alternating formations often going from 4-3-3 to 4-4-2. 4-2-3-1 is our default formation now I'm going to assume you know nothing about formations either because you know, we've been changing it throughout the season.

Looks like I'm not the only one that thinks this:
http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1862457-jose-mourinho-needs-to-ditch-the-4-2-3-1-at-chelsea-before-its-too-late

Oh and what's that? We switched to 4-4-2 and had Demba Ba and Torres upfront?
http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/01/chelsea-southampton

Do you understand, bud bud? Formations can change anytime during any game.

By the way my idea of having Lukaku and Torres isn't my idea it's the logical idea that Chelsea has so far that was coined up by many fans. Perhaps we will sign another striker that can net more goals next season but like I said Torres, Lukaku, and Demba Ba are currently our strongest point. Lukaku is our long term striker and Mourinho, along with our fans know that he's our long term striker. Torres won't be there for long much to YOUR liking but for now he's the best we got.

There's nothing wrong with passing backwards, sideways, or forwards, it doesn't really matter (as long as it isn't out of play or to the other team) if it keeps the ball moving quickly and opens up space. I just think that if your job is to recycle possession and make easy passes to open men around the midfield line, having a high pass percentage isn't impressive. In fact, it should be expected. Main point, nothing wrong with passing backwards or sideways, but completion percentage as a result shouldn't be lauded.

Changing formation doesn't have to be the answer but if it works we can go with it. We played 4-3-3 as well FYI. The reason we always start 4-2-3-1 is because we're accustomed to it. It's called tactical flexibility. Bayern Munich changed from 4-2-3-1 to 4-1-4-1 (albeit temporarily) are you saying Chelsea can't or shouldn't?

I know I said WE'VE OFTEN changed but I meant MOURINHO has often changed his tactics and not with just Chelsea. Forgive me for misusing the word 'we' since you know, I stand by all our players and manager like a real fan.

Also did you not read the website article that I posted on why Mourinho needs to change the formation? We can go back to the default one once we have a mature Lukaku... I don't think you're thinking long term buddy, just short term.

The police should report things to a 'highway maintenance' part of government (I always see these vans), and putting it on a scale of seriousness. So a 1-3scale, keeping it simple.

The roads get goods to people, people to work, and is the fucking lifeline of our country. Keeping them nice and smooth should be a major policy. 

I mean realistically, the tories could cut and strip down the NHS to fuck, move that saved money across onto our roads and people who haven't been in hospital, or had any close friends/relatives in, would think 'yeahh the tories sorted out our roads I haven't seen pot holes in ages!', this should even be a labour policy. 'No pot hole is left for more than 24hrs without being seen to, the tories didn't take care of the roads'.

It's irritating when people say it's not worth improving it ""because no one lives there"", well that's true, because there are no jobs, because the infrastructure isn't good enough, because no one lives there, etc etc. You could do a lot for the South West with even the fraction of the £50 billion planned for HS2, but it's a shame it will never happen.

The bigger issue that is often ignored it that lowering the population for most of year kills all the independent businesses like local butchers, greengrocers etc. so you end up with a town full of gift shops only open during the peak months and a few charity shops filling in the gaps.

The most disgusting thing that happened here was when some local fisherman wanted planning on the Helford river for a small jetty so they could land their catch. The people in the holiday homes objected and used their greater cash resources to fight in court and ensure planning for this was rejected. However they made sure that they got approval for a larger one for their own boats but it was further up the river.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Not really, if I'm driving I'm not going to get my phone out (can't even do that when you're stopped at lights), so I'm going to get where I'm going and forget about it. The real problem is, is the fact that I PAY TAXES, and these taxes take care of other peoples jobs, which are public jobs like police officers who should be made to call in any pot holes. 

Why wouldn't that make sense? If we can get police officers calling in pot holes when they see them, as they're cruising around waiting for a call, which is effectively 'making use of down time', for police officers, why not utilise them? 

I could volunteer to pick up litter, but I actively walk past litter on the floor other people have dropped, when I could pick it up and take to a bin. And to be honest, I would do this. If our culture was different and we were aggressively efficient at sorting out shit like litter/pot holes, I would confront anybody who drops any litter.. the problem is everybody does it and it's accepted. 

Now, rather than run a huge expensive campaign to turn the public mentality against pot holes and to report them whenever they see them.. it'd be easier to just make sure the police do it instead, as a part of their job. 

Maybe with a 'report the pot hole' app that's across andoid, apple and BBos, which they can mark as 'logged' in that area, which the public also have the availability to see who logged it, when, and then when it was noted as 'fixed'. Technology could be a help in this. 

Day to day people are selfish, they just won't admit it. I'm selfish and I admit it, I could send an email to my MP right now and say 'sort these things', it's the fact that the police will have seen these things before me and they haven't gotten around to calling up anybody to sort it, which they should do. 

Keeping the community free from criminals, and pot holes and random rubbish on central reservations wouldn't be a lot more work for them, and would actively help paint police in a better light, especially if we had apps like I mentioned that the BBC can advertise for.

true,cloew11,num42-away,,"I don't know how much you know, so here's the basics:

If you win a game, you get 3 points.  If you draw a game (0-0, 1-1, etc), you get 1 point.  If you lose a game, you get no points.

Each team plays each other twice, home and away; after all 38 games, whoever has the most points wins the Premier League and the title, no playoff required.  The top 4 teams get into  a European-wide tournament called the Champions League, which means a lot more money through TV rights.  The fifth placed team gets into another European-wide tournament called the Europa League, which gets some money but not as much.

The three teams with the lowest points get regulated into the 2nd tier of English football, the Championship.  Likewise, three teams from the Championship get promoted into the Premier League, which is a lot more money.  It keeps the best performing teams in the top league.

As far as which team you should follow, go with what your gut says.  Watch a couple games and see who you like; it doesn't matter if it's Sunderland or Arsenal, go with who you like watching.  NBCSN has really good coverage of the Premier League; if its not on there, I usually stream online through illicit websites.  

I liked watching Spurs, so I chose them, and they chose me.  Afterwards, I started following more about the team and the players.

It's interesting in that it covers some of the major points to consider. Also, he ultimately chooses Spurs.

""Should I expect years of heartbreak, living always on the cusp of success?"" Pretty much, but the victories in the EPL are often more reminiscent of college sports than American pro leagues (beating your rival, spoiling things for your rival, big wins on the road, etc.). Since the early 90s, only 5 teams have won the league title (worse than the NBA!), and one of them is not a good bet ever to do so again. What I'm saying is that a league title is not a realistic goal for most teams at the start of the season.

The reason why the Champions League is so important is money and prestige. With money and prestige, a team can acquire better players, and improve future chances for continued Champions League participation along with winning titles, cups, and big matches.

Oh yea, cups. Alongside the league matches, there are two round-robin single elimination tournaments: the League Cup and the FA Cup. The FA Cup is prestigious, the League Cup is not. However, both bring with them an ultimate accomplishment, which makes them quite attractive for teams especially without high aspiration for winning the league.

Oh yeah, and then there is the Europa League. The Europa League is to the Champions League as the NIT is to March Madness, except half the teams who lose in the first round of the Champions League get entered into the Europa League. The money is an order of magnitude lower, so fans debate whether the Europa League is a worthwhile use of resources.

All EPL games are shown on NBC Sports. If it's not on one of their many channels, they put them all online for free for cable subscribers.

Since the two clubs represent a massive chunk of Scottish football fans, it made sense.

In general, if you're trying to market your company, sponsoring a football club in some capacity (shirt sponsorship especially, but also training kit sponsorship, stadium rebranding, ad boards, etc) is a good way to make sure your name gets out to millions of people. More than likely, if a team already has an 'official car sponsorship', then another car company would have to find another team to sponsor. It's all about finding the match between the company and the club.

A company might want to increase its standing in a foreign country, and thus will sponsor a club in that country. Similarly, a club might want to market themselves to another country, and so will look for deals with companies based in that region. It's a two-way street.

RTD was incredible, Rose was incredible, Martha was wonderful, Donna was brilliant and Wilf is one of the best companions I've seen. 

All of them have amazing character development, I challenge you to go back and re-watch Martha's episodes as she has some of the best of nu-Who (Not counting Blink as Doctor/Martha is not really in it) but Gridlock, 42, Human Nature/Family Of Blood Utopia/Sound Of Drums.

Hell, I'd go so far as to say that bar the Daleks In Manhattan two parter Series 3 is almost perfect. 

Sure, RTD gave us The Doctor Dobby which was a bit silly. But Moffat gave us magic Doctor escaping the Pandorica with no possible way to but don't worry BOOTSTRAP PARADOX AH AH AH, remember that sonic screwdriver that can't open the pandorica? IT CAN NOW. 

Enough of that.

Also, back off Midnight, it's one of the best episodes of Who because that's what humans are like if you stick a bunch of them in a room with unknown elements under pressure. We suck, deal with it. 

Moffat's Characters are cardboard cutouts? No, not necessarily. But they must be some of the strangest people ever. I mean I like Rory, I like Clara... But god damn I do not like Amy or River. 

River was amazing in Silence In The Library/Forest Of The Dead, but throughout Elevens run she steadily deteriorated from an incredibly complex interesting character to flirtymchellosweetie. It became a guessing game of when she would perform one of a few actions and have you noticed how she says 'Hello sweetie' or 'spoilers' in every episode she's in?

Amy is my biggest problem, she started off feisty, okay fine and yeah bound to be some testing if a man offers you all of time and space, she goes for Rory, okay. She loses Rory but can't remember? Okay. She gets him back and marries him? Okay.

Then he dies and dies and dies and she is completely unphased after an initial outburst of shock/horror/sadness.etc. 

Then, she loses her child. HER CHILD. GONE. KIDNAPPED BECAUSE OF THE DOCTOR.

He then promises to find her and consequently... Doesn't. They don't seem to care. 

My biggest problem with Amy is that she goes through multiple things that one of which would severely damage the average persons psychological well being, she see's the man she loves die multiple times. MULTIPLE and she loses her child. Her parents are re-introduced after being erased from time to sit there and are never mentioned again.

Lets not even mention the divorce thing. 

Moffat just added plot lines for her that seem to be relevant for an episode and disappear just to liven things up, but those things would destroy a normal person. ",0,1388965439,null,0,false,0,cei82r7,t3_1uf1au,t1_cei82r7,t3_1uf1au,null,1431814485,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

The 8 weeks arrears requirement (which I suspect differs from council to council; mine never mentioned anything of the sort) is an easy one: drop any such requirements and make direct payment the default.

Making landlords liable for overpayments is clearly unfair and should be scrapped. The claimant should be liable, end of story.

The tough one is dealing with arrears if benefits do get cancelled and the tenant has no other way of paying rent. Clearly this is a bad situation for all involved. In the majority of cases the situation should not last for long; housing benefit should still be paid purely on the basis of income. When my JSA got stopped for several months (story isn't a long one but not relevant here) the council let me know they had stopped my HB, so I went and told them I didn't have any other income and they continued paying it, including making up the arrears. They handled the situation much more humanely than the DWP.

That being the case I would suggest banning insurers and mortgage providers from discriminating against tenants on such grounds. The problem should pushed upwards along the chain to those best equipped to cushion the financial blow of a month's arrears, not pushed downwards to vulnerable people living hand-to-mouth or their landlords who as dependent on their income as the rest of us.

Of course if we implemented Basic Income none of this would be an issue but since we're not going to do that in my lifetime we're stuck with patching the current system.

true,pieartiste,null,null,"&gt; you can half the number of HIV transmissions from false-negative blood while only losing 4-5% of your total donors

This doesn't really follow.  Some other things you need to take into account:

* are MSMs (men who have sex with men) just as likely to donate blood as other people?
* are undiagonsed HIV-positive people, and undiagnosed HIV-positive MSMs, just as likely to donate blood as other people?
* how many MSMs donate blood at the moment and lie on the questionnaire?
* does asking people whether they are an MSM put any eligible people off donating blood?
* how many MSMs would be ineligible for other reasons (they inject drugs, they know they are HIV-positive, they are sex workers, they have some other serious medical condition, etc.)?
* HIV isn't the only blood-borne disease they are concerned about - hepatitis is also more common in MSMs, for example

Also, to me it seems that there is a problem with the approach of focusing purely on the blood supply instead of the overall effect on public health.  For example, if somebody is unaware that they are HIV-positive and donates blood, it is very likely to show up in the screening, and they can then be diagnosed and put on treatment, so they will be less likely to transmit HIV to anyone else.  The stigmatising effect of banning groups from donating should at least be taken into consideration, too.

AFAIK, the blood donation people (can't remember the name) don't really have a good understanding of the effect that lifting the ban would have.  They have considered asking more detailed questions about your sex life and basing the decision on how many sexual partners you have had and what kinds of sex acts you have performed instead of which gender(s) you have performed them with, but apparently a lot of people would be put off donating if they had to answer these questions.

&gt; What does annoy me is that black people (at least in the US) have a similar rate of HIV to gay men, but aren't excluded. Racial discrimination is too much, but homophobia isn't.

Well, in the US, if the government discriminates based on race, it has to be ""narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest"" to be deemed compatible with the constitution, whereas if the government discriminates based on sexual orientation or gender identity, it only has to be ""rationally related to a legitimate government interest"".

Also, have a good look at sheltered housing associations. A friend of mine got a flat for incredibly cheap (less than £50 per month) through a housing association on Jamaica Mews, it was tiny but a hell of a lot better than being homeless.


I know it's shit but I would try and stay on a friends couch for the time being, at least you can trust them around your stuff and it's a better standard of living than any hostel. As mentioned already, a permanent address you can use for post will be vital for a lot of things.


But yeah, you need a job and a flat asap. The job centre will obviously have jobs you can search through but also try Gumtree (private postings will always get back to you quicker) and look for positions people need filled urgently.

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"I've kind of written off the hope of top four, because of the following factors:

a) We are still very much a team in progress.  Yes, we've had some good results lately, but they've been largely against crap teams (and yes, I include Utd in that assessment).  As much as people are expecting big things from Lamela, I honestly don't think we'll see much from him this season.  My main hope is that he's good to go for the start of next season.

b) Horrendous injuries.  Yes, we'll have some key players back soon, but re-integrating them into a squad that is only just starting to gel a bit is another problem.

c) Thin squad in a few areas.  We need another CB, a top class LB, and at least one more striker, two if Defoe leaves.  If Adebayor gets injured, we're fucked.  Soldado too, but perhaps less so.  I have always contended that Danny Rose is the worst player in our first choice starting XI... don't think he offers much in attack or defence.  For all our central midfielders and wingers, we lack depth in major areas of the pitch.

d) Goal difference.  Given how close this year is, I would not be surprised for fourth place to come down to goal difference.  If so, we're screwed.  We're too far behind now to make up 20+ goal differential between us and say Liverpool.

e) Europa League.  We consistently drop points after midweek EL games, and unless we completely fob off the whole competition (which I don't think is likely), I reckon we'll keep doing so.  Our best bet for fourth place is pipping Liverpool, and they don't have any European competition to distract them, or drain their energy and players.

f) Finally, I fully expect this Honeymoon period with Sherwood to slowly wane.  Every time you get a new manager, you get an immediate bump in form because players are shaken into stepping up and trying to prove themselves for the new man.  They also get confidence from a fresh approach, having lost confidence under the previous regime.  However, it doesn't last forever.  Eventually, the manager's plans and approach takes over and we learn fully if he's the right person or not.  Not saying that Sherwood isn't, or that our results will get worse.  But we can't look at a half dozen games and accurately predict the rest of the season.  The next six games will be the most telling.

true,gomez12,null,null,"Incidence of HIV is **dramatically** higher in gay (or I should say men who have sex with men I suppose!) populations. In fact, it's bizarrely increasing year on year. That's not knocking gay people at all - it's just a straightforward, very sad, fact. Some stats I'm seeing on a quick google are saying it may be as high as 1/20 gay men have HIV, compared to less than 1/500 in the rest of the population.

So basically, by not allowing gay people to donate blood, we remove the riskiest portion and significantly reduce the chance of getting HIV contaminated blood. And simply, we take the view that it's better to be safe than sorry. The testing isn't perfect, it can have errors, false positive and false negatives. For the standard testing blood is batched, where maybe 10 donors are pooled together and tested.

It was voted one of the worst university towns as far as that goes! There are 'clubs', you may like them, but I don't! Outside of that there are a decent amount of more interesting and cultured things to do, lots of artsy sorts, some really nice pubs, and proximity to London means you're only about 50 minutes from the best night out you could have anyway.

* If you're living and working centrally you can walk the whole place no problem if you want, the outskirts are mainly residential and the science and business parks. Cars will be even worse to get around Cambridge with the 20mph limit impending anyway, not a great investment just for city travel.

* Expensive. But it depends on the quality of living you want.

* It's one of the most expensive cities in the UK so you're not exactly going to be living it up all the time, not if you want to have any money, so it depends on your habits! But you'll be comfortable on £30k. Is that net or gross? Big difference there.

Contrary to popular belief, their policies support more than just the supposed upper class of inherited land owners. There is actually quite a large ""middle-class"" core that have never inherited any land or any significant quantity of money. The middle and lower classes of this country can be worked into or out of relatively easily in this country now. There is absoloutely nothing stopping a very poor person working hard to start a business and ""become middle classed."" 

From my perspective the upper classes can essentially be ignored due to their negligible economic impact on the country. When  policies such as shutting down uneconomical coal pits come about they do so for the benefit of the middle class, not for the landed gentry. A balance of social policies that benefit both ""classes"" is in my opinion the ideal.

Wrong on both counts. We could do it with [Land Value Tax.](http://www.landvaluetax.org/what-is-lvt/) 

[Here's the IFS supporting it.](http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/feb/02/ifs-backs-land-value-tax)

&gt;I have long been persuaded that resource rents should be socialised, not accrue to individual owners. Yet, as Mr Harrison tellingly remarks, “as a community we socialise our privately earned incomes (wages and salaries), while our social income (from land) is privatised.” Yet, whatever one thinks of the justice of this arrangement, the practical consequences have become calamitous. Do we want to start yet another credit-fuelled property cycle as soon as the debris of the present one is cleared away, some years of misery hence? 

&gt;If “a crisis is a terrible thing to waste”, here is an urgent case for action. Socialising the full rental value of land would destroy the financial system and the wealth of a large part of the public. That is obviously impossible. But socialising any gain from here on would be far less so. This would eliminate the fever of land speculation. It would also allow a shift in the burden of taxation. Perhaps as important, with the prospects of effortless increases in wealth removed, the UK might re-examine its planning laws.

It felt like every resolution was crammed into those 50 minutes like some kind of storytelling turducken: you're glad to get everything, but in the end it's just too much.

I'm a fan of the RTD stories, particularly of the direction that the Time War took the Ninth and Tenth Doctors, psychologically speaking.  But I greatly appreciate Steven Moffat as showrunner--even if he occasionally frustrates the hell out of me--because he manages to bring rich, layered stories to a one-hour television show.  I agree with you that there are issues with his female characters changing to fit the plot, and I feel like even if they were occasionally uninteresting the RTD companions were at least consistent and acted, well, human.

true,justpoppedout,null,null,"Finishing in the top 4 means that you get entry into the very lucrative [Champions League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League) where you play the other top clubs in Europe. It's the most prestigious cup to win and you get tens of millions of dollars just for qualifying. The best players only want to play in it so it's difficult for clubs to attract the best if they finish outside the top 4. 

If you're going to make some sort of equivalence it's like getting to the playoffs for the next year. For the last few years Spurs have been on the cusp of qualifying each year. They've made it once and missed it by the slimmest margins possible in a couple of other years. 

There are probably now 7 teams competing for the 4 places so it's tough to get in. So yes, you'll feel heartbreak sometimes but because there's no sense of entitlement or anything you'll also experience elation when they qualify. 

Spurs are a team who can compete with the best in England (they just beat the current champions Manchester United at Manchester's home ground) but aren't one of the super rich clubs that always win. In that sense, they're similar to Knicks and definitely not the Yankees. If you were a little unkind you'd call them '2nd tier' (if the top tier only has 3-5 clubs in it) but they can beat the best. 

In terms of this season being half over, it's really only just begun as all the top teams are very very close to each and anything can really happen (it finishes in May). It's a crazy season with many of the top teams changing manager so it's very open. Spurs have just got a new manager too (in the last few weeks) so it's almost like a new season for Spurs starting now. 

Follow as much as you can and see if you like the way they play. Maybe you'll find yourself rooting for another team for some reason but Spurs are a good team with great potential (and I'm not even a Spurs supporter.) They're a good team to support.

It's not exactly proof in any sense but it seems possible when you look at those players earning the big money at WHUFC e.g. Nolan moving down to the Championship for a BIG contract (£50k per Week), and also Carroll earning megabucks. 

It won't surprise me if we lose Morrison due to some ridiculous argument between Big Sam and his agent (rumours having started already)

It's also the only place I've ever lived, at any age to remember, so I don't have much to compare to besides London; which can be visited regularly due to its close proximity.

It's a good place to live for certain kinds of people, more intellectual and cultural people seem to get on great, but other types find it difficult to live here in my experience. I'd say this is probably due to the universities and the atmosphere. The night life varies, I'm not really into clubs and I've heard they aren't too great here. But mentioning the short journey to London, you can always take the train to a great night out.

To live in central Cambridge it is preferable to have a bike, it makes a lot of things more convenient and a large number of people also get around by bike for that reason too. However there are buses and other forms of transport, if you don't want to/can't use a bike then other options are certainly available.

The housing is pretty expensive in the city, so I'd look into house sharing or look into a place on the outskirts as there are lots of villages scattering the edge of Cambridge. If you feel a house is needed in the city then I'm sure there are certain areas that could be cheaper if you're willing to patch up a house.

It's varies depending on what you do with your free time, it can be really expensive or super cheap. Personally my hobbies and interests stretch to things I can get online easily. And food is slightly above average, so I get on fine with a little budget put away at the end of the month.

Someone like Tom MacRae would be cool. He has only done 3 episodes so far, so I doubt it will be him, but his episodes (Rise of the Cybermen/The Age of Steel, The Girl Who Waited) have that dark tone that I miss from the show. In The Age of Steel, the Doctor defeated the Cybermen by turning on their emotions and basically torturing them all to madness and death. Then in The Girl Who Waited, they introduced the possibility of Old Amy surviving, but never being seen again, and still killed her off. These endings left an empty pit in your stomach, but it was them that made the happy endings so special. It was the constantly increasing body counts in season 1 that brought tears to our eyes when when The Doctor said ""Just this once. Everyone lives!!!""

b) A failing social system where men and women feel that relationships are too much trouble because they have to work 14 hours a day.

The system is tenable... as long as the populace can sustain it... increased financial strain directly correlatese with reduced number of births per annum, and as the older generations become older, and medical technology becomes better (I believe the AVERAGE life expectancy is something like 78 for males and 80+ for females in Japan), the system will start to fail as theres no functional way for the pyramid to support itself.

Oscar-Essien-Mikel-Ramires

Azpilicuenta-Cahill

Cole-Luiz-Torres

Hazard

Defense: Terry has played in net, I'd trust him with the gloves. Oscar and Ramires have incredible work rates, along with decent defensive abilities. They'll bomb down the wings and cross while tracking back to defend. I cheated a little and put 2 DM's at CB. Mikel and Essien, although not the fastest, are strong and good in the air.

Midfield: Dave is great at distributing the ball, and when partnered with Cahill who's a rock in defense and disciplined, Dave can roam while Gary can cover. Cole and Torres on the wings. Torres can use his possession and passing to deliver crosses and be free to launch shots if he get the chance. Cole is relatively pacey and can cross, which is another great feature. Luiz holds the center and launches bombs from 30 yards out, along with the freedom to chase the ball in defense and start the counterattack.

Attack: Hazard has played a CF at Lille, and he's our leading goal scorer this year. He's explosive, deadly with both feet, and love to get forward and stay there. He, unlike our current strike force, finishes his chances, and he'd thrive here.

I'd play this team with a false nine with Hazard. He can't really header the ball, so we must use his technical ability to outshine his rather poor aerial ability. Possession until an opening would be the best course of attack for this squad.",0,1388991986,null,0,false,0,ceijkxr,t3_1uimnf,t1_ceijkxr,t3_1uimnf,null,1435536828,8,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,8

I only ask because I've not heard of too many unis that *don't* require you to apply through UCAS. I've definitely never heard of the 'common ap' here in the UK, although there is a common application for universities in the US.

As others have said, you'd be wise to contact Edinburgh directly, either their Admissions department or possibly the department for the degree you want to do, and asking them. 

However, I can't imagine it would be a great idea to apply for 5 courses at the same uni. It would be difficult to write a neatly tailored personal statement if you're applying for five different courses; it would also be fairly transparent that you really just want to go to Edinburgh which **might** work in your favour but also runs the risk of making it look like you don't really know which course you want to do.

The more pragmatic reason for not applying to five courses at the same uni and from the same department is that they would likely have similar (if not identical) entry requirements. Thus if you fail to meet your offer you'd have no recourse.

Property prices fell significantly at the start of the recession. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7812108.stm

This wiped out years of savings which people put into deposits and put a lot of people into negative equity. Just because they didn't fall to £1.49 so every 18 year old can get on the property ladder, it doesn't mean the dive wasn't devastating for a lot of people. Just think if you had saved for years and built up a 15% deposit - 85% is now not an irresponsible LTV. That would have been wiped out completely - do you want to tell the people who lost 10s of thousands of pounds that prices didn't dive?

LB: Hazard - Jose gives Hazard his wish and lets him just run up and down the pitch like he said he wanted to do. 

CB: Mata - teach him how to defend the proper way. 

CB: KDB - needs some playing time to work on his defensive game. 

RB: Hilario - at almost 40, what he lacks in pace, he almost certainly makes up in experience. 

DM: Schwarzer - Jose told us to expect this, so no surprises. He's big and tall, perfect for cutting out long balls over the top 

DM: Cech - completes an incredibly dangerous double pivot. No fear that this team will end up just playing long balls over the top, this pairing will provide a solid foundation for the free flowing tiki-taka passing game. 

LM: Terry - more dangerous than Ribery with the ball at his feet. One of the most dangerous dribblers in the game. 

CAM: Luiz - the main creative force of the team. A dangerous visionary who's style of attacking football could revolutionise the modern game. 

RM: Blackman - told Jose he watched Robben play a couple of times whilst down the pub, reckons it's not that hard and that anybody could do it.

true,jjones217,num23,,"&gt;aren't I at risk of watching meaningless games

I'm not sure if anyone has answered this yet, so I'll have a go at it.

In short, the answer is no - but it can depend on a multitude of things.

In terms of watching Spurs matches - as of late, we really have been in it until the end, so no match for us seems to be meaningless.

Getting in the top four is of primary concern if we aren't in the title race, so every match is important, even if it's against a team that, on paper, is terrible.

When you watch American sports, many games are meaningless or feel meaningless, as teams are eliminated or qualify for the playoffs. Once you're in and the chances of increasing your seed have all but gone, games are, in essence, meaningless. 

When the Yankees have clinched the AL East, and they the next team by 6 games with less than a month to go, the games are meaningless. Sure you want them to win and clinch the division but, at the end of the day, you're in the playoffs so screw it if they lose they remaining regular season games.

It's the same thing with hockey and basketball, too. If you're team is in, the last 5-10 games don't always matter that match.

For the NFL it's a bit different, of course, as there are only 16 games in a season and often times, as with this year, playoff spots often stay open until the final week, so every game is crucial if you're in the hunt. And even after you've qualified, you still often have a chance at improving your seeding and getting home field or a first-round bye, which are both a huge advantage.

The Premier League is similar to that. If you are in the hunt for top four - or even top 5 as the 5th seed qualifies for the Europa League, every match matters. 

You're playing for three points and they are crucial, but sometimes you're okay with a draw and will even understand a loss. 

You'll come to find, especially as the season marches on, that pundits, forum commenters, and even managers will start to use terms like “drop points”, “pick up a point” or “settle for a draw”. That’s because fans and managers realize that you can’t expect to win every game, but you can expect to win certain games.

In American sports, unless your team is absolute shit, there is a reasonable chance or possibility of winning on any given day. I’m a Pirates fan. For most of my life, they were terrible. Yet despite this, every time I went to a game, I had reasonable hope that they would win, because they always had at least a 40-50% chance of doing so.
In the Premier League, there’s parity, it’s just not quite as normal as in American sports. For example, Spurs next fixture is home to Crystal Palace. They are a bottom of the table club. Not utter shit by any means, but losing or drawing to them would absolutely be “dropping points” because that is a game that we expect and, as fans, more or less demand to win.

Against Manchester United, however, most reasonable fans would say that we picked up 2 points, and maybe even 3 depending on who you ask. Or some people even say it’s a “six pointer” because we caused a top-four rival to lose 3 points, whilst we picked up 3 – unexpectedly by most standards – causing a 6 point shift in the table from what most people would have expected.

Anyway, I digress. Now back to the original point.

As the season goes into the second half – this season especially – there is no clear champion and no clear top 3 or even top 4. So, from a Spurs fan’s perspective, every match we play absolutely matters. 

In the coming months, we’ll do our damnedest NOT to drop points to Crystal Palace or Hull City. On the reverse side, we’ll hope to pick up three points against title favorites Manchester City, but in the end we’d settle for 1 point against them.  In our game against Swansea, we’ll hope not to drop points but, again, an away draw to a side that’s picking up steam like they are would be a reasonable result.

Outside of Tottenham’s matches, not every single game is consequential, but most of them DO matter in the larger sense. All games involving the top 6 or 7 teams matter because everyone is playing for top four and even 5th, so every point matters. All games involving the bottom 10 teams matter, at least for now, as they are all playing to avoid relegation. 

Naturally, as the season winds down and teams are statistically eliminated from contention for fourth and fifth place, and teams in the bottom start to secure safety from the drop, games DO become meaningless – but only in terms of placement for next year.
 
But to passionate fans of any and all of those teams, no game is every meaningless. There are streaks to maintain, history to keep, bragging rights to be had, team pride to achieve or retain. Some managers may treat those games as opportunities to give youth squad players a chance at Premier League action, but fans will still want to see their side end the season in good form. 

Oh, and with this year being a World Cup year, no doubt games will still matter to every player whose country has qualified as they will hope to impress their skipper and earn a spot in the squad.

1. Thatcher did NOT personally write letters to the families of those killed and maimed in the Falklands war. That is a myth. She wrote a few but the majority were written on her behalf and just signed by her. And so she should - it was her arrogance that caused the war in the first place. 

1. You are partly right about coal. It is not an inexhaustible resource and getting it out of the ground was becoming increasingly expensive. Traditional coal fired power stations did produce unacceptable pollution but newer, fluid bed, technology was being developed which was significantly cleaner. There are two real issues - a) coal, like oil, is a valuable mineral resource and not just for burning. b) Even if it was right to run down the mines - the way she treated the miners was inhumane, heartless and disgusting. Yes, more mines were closed by Labour/Blair but, by the time she left office, the decline was inevitable.

1. While everyone points to her battles with the miners - that was only the tip of the iceberg. Look at what she did to the rest of British industry. Her philosophy was 'if it doesn't make a profit - close it' and this is nowhere better illustrated in British Steel which she decimated. Instead of the subsidies she was paying to keep British Steel afloat she ended up paying far more in unemployment pay and creating misery for those thrown out of work. I travel regularly through the West Midlands and you could see it becoming a wasteland of long term unemployment and despair under Thatcher. Her economic policies were short-termist and the lives of those devastated did not factor into her calculations. 

1. The point made in the article was correct in that she not only changed one party, but two. The Blair and his Labour government was far more right wing than many previous Tory governments prior to Thatcher. 

The reality is that those that supported her her and did her bidding were supported by her but, against those who stood against her, she was ruthless. 

Thatcher had respect for the strong but despised the weak and had no compassion for them at all.

  The nicotine patches *after* day 5? Your doctor is an arsehole, that's the worst advice I have ever heard of. Takes about 3-5 days for all the nicotine to clear out of your body, introducing more so you can wean yourself off again is fucking *evil*; I seriously would not recommend that to my worst enemy. Just cut it the fuck out, each one you don't have is a little victory, you might slip up every now and then but **it is not a failure**, it's just putting you back to the bottom of the pile.   
  
  Number one tip - if you have a smartphone, download a cessation app, I used QuitNow! on Android, it's free and it counts up the seconds since your last fag, every time you feel like having one, check out the stats page and see Xx:Xx:Xx time since your last cigarette, how much money you have saved and *how many cigarettes you've managed not to have*, I found that really good. ""Why have one now, when I've already managed to not have 250?""  Plus, the money you've saved ticker - treat yourself when you reach a goal. If you're smoking 20 a day after a month you'll have over 220 quid saved up. Fuck yeah man, that's an off-season week away!
  
  Exercise. Push yourself, every time you go for a run/cycle/climb/swim, you'll get a bit further, and a little bit further after that. Progress. Once you can see and feel that you are getting stronger, fitter, healthier, you'll feel good. And if you push yourself really hard, you'll not want a fag.  
  
  Caffeine and alcohol. Get rid of them, they'll trigger cravings. Besides, healthy. 
  
  Cravings last no longer than 2-4 minutes, after that it's all mental. Just tell yourself to fuck right off whenever you think 'oooh maybe...' **NO**.

I am just using Ford here as an example (as it's starting to look like I must work for Ford) as a lot of manufacturers these days offer something similar for their second hand cars.

The reason to go with a main dealer is they do tend to be a higher standard and offer proper guarantees because they are affiliated with the manufacturer who will insist on a certain standard of practice for one of their dealers.

This is not to say you won't find a bad main dealer but it's far less likely than if you go to some dealer who just specialises in second hand cars of any make.

""Gone"" ... as in every single house was sold to property speculators? Nope, don't think so.

What happened was people who'd spent their lives so far in council housing, and were likely to do so for the rest of their natural ... and then their kids, and possibly grandkids also ... were given a chance to buy it rather than spending dead money on rent.

Better they take pride in looking after their own place, than letting it go to rot until the council rolled out the next wave of ""renovations"" (repaint and stucco job) every 10 years at the tax-payers expense. 

That house would *never* have come available for rent by anyone else anyway, so to claim it either ""lost"" or ""gone"" is downright deceptive. Seems strange that the supposed 2.1 million people who sold to ""the evil property developer"" (complete with twirly mustache and sneaky grin) managed to find somewhere ELSE to live?

&gt; I don't understand why people are so keen to dismiss, ignore or try and debunk this unequivocal fact. 

I don't understand why people are so critical of governments who do the exact fucking thing they asked for in the first place i.e. give them their only chance to own their own place and get onto the property ladder.

Yes, more should have been built to replenish the stock. This is crystal clear. But can we stop with this revisionist bullshit? We need to look AHEAD now and find solutions, not spend our lives pointing fingers at the past.

Over time this has created a community deprived of those best positioned to fuel its economy with business and best positioned to challenge provincial attitudes and prejudices. It's a vicious circle at this point - few with a degree would return and put themselves through the economic hardships when there's easy money and a better life to be had elsewhere, and yet the opportunities and problems cannot be easily created and solved without their skill-sets, talent and ambition.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Not really, if I'm driving I'm not going to get my phone out (can't even do that when you're stopped at lights), so I'm going to get where I'm going and forget about it. The real problem is, is the fact that I PAY TAXES, and these taxes take care of other peoples jobs, which are public jobs like police officers who should be made to call in any pot holes. 

So call when you get to the office/home. Drop them an e-mail on your break to let them know

&gt; Why wouldn't that make sense? If we can get police officers calling in pot holes when they see them, as they're cruising around waiting for a call, which is effectively 'making use of down time', for police officers, why not utilise them? 

Because the police rarely have downtime and they're not training Highways Inspectors. They might call in a pothole that's only 3mm's deep, call it an emergency because they've got someone in their ear shouting at them... wasting their time and councils.

&gt; I would confront anybody who drops any litter.. the problem is everybody does it and it's accepted. 

I do confront people, they very often say ""Sorry"" and pick it up when confronted. That's the issue... and no, not everyone does it.

&gt; Now, rather than run a huge expensive campaign to turn the public mentality against pot holes and to report them whenever they see them.. it'd be easier to just make sure the police do it instead, as a part of their job. 

They do it as part of their job around me, but only when they're large enough to be a serious danger on the road as governed by the Highways Act. They aren't going to call in all the ones on a road they go by because a) it would take them forever to do, b) they might not have all the information and c) it'd prevent them from doing their job... which is enforcing the law, not scouting for potholes.

&gt; Maybe with a 'report the pot hole' app that's across andoid, apple and BBos, which they can mark as 'logged' in that area, which the public also have the availability to see who logged it, when, and then when it was noted as 'fixed'. Technology could be a help in this. 

There's a website called ""Fixmystreet.com"" if you're that interested buddy. But yes there are people who work on apps like that... 

&gt; Day to day people are selfish, they just won't admit it. I'm selfish and I admit it, I could send an email to my MP right now and say 'sort these things', it's the fact that the police will have seen these things before me and they haven't gotten around to calling up anybody to sort it, which they should do. 

&gt; Keeping the community free from criminals, and pot holes and random rubbish on central reservations wouldn't be a lot more work for them, and would actively help paint police in a better light, especially if we had apps like I mentioned that the BBC can advertise for.

Too much work, not enough time and priorities come first. I'd rather the Police go out and do actual work than do the job of a 19K a year Highways Inspector/Technical officer. You'd essentially be putting the Police in a position where if you could clap your hands and they'd do work for you that you think would benefit society. They really do have enough on their hands as it is.

If you see a pothole, street light out, fly-tipping... fixmystreet.com/co.uk whatever one it is OR speak to your local council and inform them. They aren't mind-readers, they don't know things are there unless you tell them buddy.

Bearing that in mind there are things that can be done and there are things that make very little impact.

The two things that must be done are :-

1. Reduce consumption of **Non-UK** goods and services.

2. Increase production of goods and services sold abroad.

At the present, the chancellor's policy seems to be directed solely at the first of these and, even then, he is doing it indirectly by reducing the money supply in general. Sure, this reduces consumption of foreign goods and services but it also reduces consumption of domestic goods and services which, in turn, harms those companies that could also export. 

We have got in so deep there is no easy answer but the current government is using a very blunt instrument to reduce consumption and doing little to help our companies earn abroad.

Good luck cutting spending when the population is predicted to reach 80 million by 2050, with such a rapidly growing population any spending cuts will be a drop in the ocean.

We could increase income from taxation, please note that this doesn't necessarily mean increasing tax rates, you can decrease tax rates and increase income from taxation, this policy is currently working very successfully for corporation tax. The bonus of 80 million people is that the government will have a bigger pool to tax from, I think this is the UK's ace card.

Inflation is just getting started, I expect the government will keep interest rates low for as long as possible to milk the effects of this as much as possible.

Holtby can help settle him, and while I never really think highlight films tell the whole story of a player, based on [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T2YzugxTjY) he seems to make great runs and could really flourish in a partnership with Soldado and his precision passes. He is also experienced in playing on the wings which would also allow him to play Soldado's role if Kane is his partner. In the current season, he has seven goals and four assists in 16 Bundesliga fixtures. He's not all potential (though there is plenty) and he's proven he can deal with a top league at a young age.

Despite this, striker is arguably our third biggest need at the moment. We don't have to stay with two up top, especially when Townsend gets fit. We definitely need a left back who, if he can't immediately start, can challenge Rose for his spot. With Kaboul's contract running out, and Dawson getting up there in age, now would be the time to bring in a young CB (ideally a commanding aerial presence which we sorely lack) when he won't be under pressure to perform immediately. This is especially necessary if you believe the rumors that Vlad's agent sees Spurs as a stepping stone, and teams are ready to bid on Vert should we miss Champions League again. I know we have Veljkovic waiting but some great depth never hurt a team.",0,1389010676,null,0,false,0,cein1bp,t3_1uj0j0,t1_cein1bp,t3_1uj0j0,null,1431821688,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

What it does do is make the ISP liable for the content of the transmission in instances where they interfere with it. Although unlike Falkvinge, I fail to see how this can be for anything more than only the specific transmission interefered with.

In order to make this directive useful for Redditors, it needs to be combined with an infringement of some other law. And since the filters are ultimately optional (no matter how you regard opt-in/out), it will be hard to pin items such as the ECHR into it.

I used to work in military R&amp;D, and I somewhat agree that a scaling down of our military is nessesary. But here's the thing; once you cut our military, our overseas aid, there's really no way back from a political standpoint.

Remember the purpose of overseas aid and the ability to project military power is about world influence, as much as anything else. Once you walk away from that you can't very easily recover it.

Are the males in these same positions any better? There's certainly a stereotype of the businessman type dude who never has time to see his children - its something you almost have to sacrifice to get such a top level job.

The balance of work to life in these types of jobs is heavily towards the job, and I don't think that can really be changed, because there's always someone who will work longer harder hours and get the promotions before someone who wants to live more of their life. And it happens to be that men are more willing to do that than women.

There is definitely sexism making it harder for women that want to to get to the top jobs too, but I think even if there wasn't any, it still wouldn't be 50:50.

Then with the financial elite and corporations extremely pissed at this, and the UK as a whole. Those companies will leave, then we have a huge hole in London with ""skilled"" white collar sheep looking for work elsewhere. There will be an extent of skill extraction with workers leaving the UK to follow their finance shepherds. 


But those who are left, with the rest of the UK will start a new bank for the people very similar to how Iceland's government step in to their banks. Then not only will we regain our culture and spread out the money throughout all of the UK not just London.

&gt;In light of the growing amount of online threats (malware, server
attacks, botnets, etc.), Internet access providers are increasingly inclined – or even legally required – to
take measures to filter the internet traffic received by their customers. Furthermore, new revenue models
are emerging, where internet access providers insert banners in webpages visited by users, in exchange
for free internet access. Also, Voice-over-IP operators may want to periodically introduce spoken
publicity during conversations, in exchange for a free service. As another example, operators of chat
networks (to the extent they qualify as mere conduit service providers) may want to automatically block
profanity wording and/or sexually oriented conversations.
Although recital 43 of the eCommerce Directive clarifies that ""manipulations of a technical nature which
take place in the course of the transmission"" should be allowed ""as they do not alter the integrity of the
information contained in the transmission"", it is not clear whether traffic filtering, insertion of
advertisements and textual filtering of chat conversations can be considered as such ""manipulations of a
technical nature"". Hence, it is not clear whether these parties can still benefit from the liability exemption
introduced by article 12.

My argument is not to reduce or increase debt, but that it is of little importance. There is no causal link between debt and growth, between debt and prosperity, debt and employment. 

We need to concentrate on encouraging growth by putting money into people's pockets and getting them to spend. All Austerity does is reduce demand and growth by reducing the amount of disposable income people have, and all because of a misunderstanding over the importance of debt.

 Amazingly you didn't see any of the legal services crying wolf when the rest of the public sector was being put to the sword BY LAWYERS.
sour grapes,possibly? knowing that legal aid is a gravy train---absofuckinglutely.

they were building Churchills and Spitfires. If you want to make an argument about whether current debt is a problem, historic spending is not good supporting evidence. 

&gt; All Austerity does is reduce demand and growth by reducing the amount of disposable income people have

Depending on the strength of the multiplier, and the time scale over which one is looking. There certainly is strong evidence and theory that government cuts will in the short term will tend to dampen demand *ceteris paribus.* However, in the medium to long term the evidence is probably cautiously in favour of low tax and spend regimes.
