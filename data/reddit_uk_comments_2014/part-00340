What is absent from your lengthy list of treatments - thanks for posting that! - is 15% azelaic acid (Finacea) which the NHS say is currently the most effective topical for the papules and pustules of rosacea (better than topical antibiotics). Benzyoyl peroxide (in the Duac) is a horrible substance, if you have a skin barrier issue this will not have helped IMO. Tretinoin (in the Aknemycin) is good in acne vulgaris but too harsh for rosacea (can use encapsulated retinol).

Just to confuse matters some antibiotics and some antifungals (basically everything you have had to date) have anti inflammatory properties so they can be somewhat effective on conditions where there is not a fungal/ bacterial issue.

For persistent redness the only topical treatment is brimonidine (Mirvaso) but when it wears off the rebound can be worse, so perhaps best suited to special occasions or when things are really bad.

Both rosacea and seborrhoeic dermatitis need self care alongside medical treatment, so it's a shame the dermatologist has not addressed this with you. Frustratingly for those in my field (lifestyle healthcare) medics rarely discuss diet tho alcohol intake and smoking are often raised with patients.

Everything I know about skincare in eczema and rosacea is down to my own research, tho to be fair I have only had one consultation about my skin in recent times and I did score a diagnosis first time out.

Not sure if I've already linked you to these when inboxing? One of the articles is on use of talc-free mineral make up for concealing flares

false,strolls,null,null,"&gt;  if a female comic makes jokes about men which are hateful and disrespectful towards men you would also agree that is misandry right?

I'd need to see some specific real-life examples to have a meaningful discussion.

But in general, I don't think the two things are totally symmetrical and you can compare them so blindly, on the ""principle"" that a joke against men is just the same as a similar joke against women.

I'm a bloke, and I don't think I'm harmed by jokes about how untidy I am, or how inept I am at domestic chores. 

If a woman were up on stage making jokes about divorce and denying her ex access to his kids, by making up stories about him being abusive, then I might concede that that promotes a harmful narrative about the way men should be treated. I doubt you'd be defending a woman who joked that ""kids don't need a father, anyway"". 

Jokes about rape are harmful because rapists *genuinely believe* that everyone else is at it - that it was just ""[last minute resistance](http://www.lovesystems.com/dating-advice/terminology/seduction-lmr-comfort)"", that it's somehow ""not really rape because…"" or that most other guys are getting away with it, too.

There certainly is a cultural narrative that women shouldn't be in certain kinds of jobs (""they just don't have a natural aptitude for computer programming"") or that they're a ""slut"" if they dress in certain ways, and that's why I think one needs to take a thoughtful attitude toward sexism. 

I accept that I don't know what it's like to be a woman, but I don't care so much whether this cultural narrative is the product of ""hatred"" or indifference - I just don't think it helps to split hairs over the pocket dictionary definition of a single word.",0,1415844222,null,0,false,0,cm0zdua,t3_2m2f29,t1_cm0zdua,t1_cm0ykru,null,1426052661,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TBZgKOqnPFs (showing how natural it can look and also showing how to apply etc, if you want info on the makeup or types of makeup he uses let me know)

http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jc8r0PpX_bY (foundation recommendations for acne sufferers) 

Look through his vids if you want more suggestions, but these two are the most helpful for you at the moment I think.

Good luck!

I mainly agree with you, but to expand on a couple of points:

I think the Master/Mistress' relative sanity is probably also down to her individual iteration, a bit like the Doctor. The fourth Doctor was wayyyyy more manic than any of his antecendants, but ultimately each iteration is the same man. I think it's the same with the Master. He/She has always been obsessed with the Doctor and has always been sociopathically evil. I think this version just happens to be particularly manic.

And I think Missy still enjoys torturing with the Doctor. He is her plaything, and I think she both loves and hates him in equal measure.

For example, There is no obvious reason for her choosing Earth for her latest scheme - messing with humanity just seems to be a standard Master tactic for getting under the Doctor's skin. She could have easily just given him an army of actual robots rather than Cybermen. But she didn't, because it would have been less fun for her.

Also on this point, I think the Master was kind of calling the Doctor's bluff with the whole Cyberman army thing in a very manipulative way. She thought he would accept it with good intentions for its use, but then become corrupted by power and realise that he is the same as her. Luckily the Doctor foresaw this and averted the situation.

Also, finally, the whole issue of her selecting Clara on the Doctor's behalf. This implies that she has travelled along the Doctor's timeline, anticipated the dangers he will face (The Great Intelligence trying to wipe out his past and the events on Trenzalore) and selected Clara as being the one person able to save the Doctor from all this. This, I suppose is the 'love' side of her obsession with the Doctor. She gave him a guardian angel to keep him safe because she needs him.

But on the flip side of this, Missy knew that Clara would eventually bring the Doctor to 'Hell' so he can fall into her trap.

When she revealed that his relationship with Clara was engineered by her, she was showing him just how much control she had over him. All this manipulation and causing the Doctor to second-guess himself and his decisions seem like a form of torture to me. Not only that, but she is letting the Doctor know just how reliant he is on her.

It's an abusive relationship, albeit one based on genuine need. ",0,1415845724,null,0,1415846052,0,cm1041d,t3_2m2uid,t1_cm1041d,t1_cm0ssut,null,1426052321,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

This is of course obviously ignoring two major factors that you fail to bring up - the fact that Lamela was settling in to an entirely new league (Gylfi had been in the PL 6 months prior,) and Lamela's injury riddled season. With all of that in mind, it's no wonder Gylfi played relatively well out of position, since he has amazing talent *and experience*, something Lamela lacks.

However I disagree a little about Ki/Shelvey at holding mids. I feel like the Shelvs/Ki pairing leads to us committing too many forward at times. While Jonjo and Ki have both been individually brilliant, I think we'd operate with either Britton or Carroll sticking behind while either Ki or Jonjo surges forward. Despite both being quite weak physically I noticed against Arsenal that Carroll and Britton play very deep and do a good job of maintaining possession while protecting the CB's on counters.

I'd love for Ki or Jonjo to dictate tempo and sit back on defence however I feel that would be a phenomenal waste of both their offensive abilities. For now I would love to see Britton in the starting line up. 

Also I 100% agree about AR and while he's a perfectly competent defender, I feel we rely on our wingers to win 1 v 1 too often, which leads me to say we should definitely start throwing Jazz in. Fortunately Taylor has developed from a League 2 to a Championship level full back in front of our eyes this season. Jokes aside, I think if he continues developing he could recapture his pre-injury form.

Personally I'm cautiously optimistic of finishing 7th, but regardless Im just enjoying the brand of football we are playing this year. This record hasn't been built on flukes or weak opponents, we've grinded through a tough schedule and faced quite a bit of adversity to get here. We've played United, Southampton, Chelsea, Arsenal and Everton and still ended up in 5th.

If you don't travel, will never work overseas or for a company with overseas offices, buy only things made in the UK with UK-sourced components or ingredients, and are not related to or friends with people who do not live in that manner, then you do not benefit from foreign aid. If you enjoy chocolate, coffee, tea, or using a mobile phone, then you benefit.

Extraordinary foreign aid serves a slightly different purpose - it aims to keep places in crisis just barely stable enough that they don't collapse utterly, because the total collapse of even a tiny nation in Sub-Saharan Africa can have negative effects on the UK that dwarf the cost of the aid that can delay or prevent that collapse. These negative effects include damage to multinationals, damage to international trade, massive increases in the cost of some raw materials as supply falls or is cut off, additional waves of refugees beyond the number we are prepared for, and the destabilization of the neighbours of the collapsed state as they will be hit much harder than us - possibly creating a domino collapse.


One consequence of the international failure to provide sufficient emergency aid to stop the current Ebola epidemic in the early stages is that the price of cacao has been fluctuating wildly for a couple of months due to concern that the outbreak might reach the Ivory Coast. This fluctuation has lead to price increases in the price of chocolate bars to consumers in some areas, although the Ivory Coast and the actual supply of cacao has yet to be affected.",0,1415846763,null,0,false,0,cm10m35,t3_2m2i24,t1_cm10m35,t1_cm0zyyl,null,1426052087,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Salah is straight garbage. All he has is pace. He's terrible on the ball and can't shoot worth a damn and doesn't pass that much considering how bad he is. 

Willian is a good workhorse, but my he is absolutely worthless in the final third of the pitch. He's good for running around and pressing opponents, but his passing isn't exceptional, his through ball ability is mediocre and his shooting is average at best. He's a good dribbler and he make short passes, but he never really does anything to set up chances for us. 

Schurrle is the only right winger we have who is actually useful on offense but he's in terrible form. His positioning and off-the-ball runs are phenomenal (like the Fabregas season opener assist and Man City goal) and he can actually create chances when he's not trying to be selfish. However, his weaknesses are his tackling ability (at least to Jose, since that's the main reason he picks Willian for defensive lineups and way too many people on here give him flak for mistakes that are more on Ivanovic), tendency to be selfish (even either in the season he wasn't passing to an open Costa) and taking unnecessary long shots.  

I understand at a big club like Chelsea we need quality everywhere to contend for the CL realistically, but let's not prepare to ship a guy out like Schurrle after his first major bad spell.

It allows the CBs to focus on sniffing out a dangerous ball and clear the danger. Simplifies their job and makes them look good.

false,ViscomteEcureuil,eu,Le Pays du Frog,"Everybody, let's get serious here. Let's not discount our lesser educated, working classes. The truth is that it is they who lose because of immigration because 1) the value of ones labour decreases with immigration, 2) the welfare state begins to fray and it is the working class natives who lose the most from this 3) since they live in low income areas, their neighborhoods loose their character and sense of community.

&gt; Put simply, to the extent a society become multi-ethnic, the more its politics becomes dominated by ethnic questions. This is visible in Canada (Québec vs. Anglo-Canada), in Belgium (the richer Flems not wanting to pay for the poorer Francophones), in the United States (black-white conflict, massive Hispanic immigration, support for more, bilingualism), etc.

&gt; Ethnocentrism, although its strength varies by community and culture, is a fundamental human characteristic born of our evolutionary past. Human communities who did not look out for each other, who did not give preference to their own kind, simply were replaced by those communities which did look out for themselves. This is a fundamental evolutionary imperative, probably on a par with the sex drive.

&gt; The criminalization of ethnocentrism, the latter being deeply ingrained in us by our evolutionary history, must necessarily lead to hypocrisy and neurosis. Everyone is ethnocentric, ergo, everyone is vulnerable to suddenly being revealed as a “racist.” Ironically this liberal doctrine curiously resembles the Christian doctrine of original sin: Everyone is guilty, even if they haven’t done anything yet…

&gt; Generally, it is not a good idea to try to build political orders against human nature. Human nature must not be denied, but attenuated where necessary, and leveraged where possible. For example, the Communists’ various attempts to create regimes notionally based on the disregard of economic self-interest all fundamentally failed in their ambition (whatever their other achievements), with economic self-interest continuing to express itself through corruption and prosperous black markets. Today most would recognize that individuals’ natural economic selfishness should not be denied, but rather properly channeled in a regulated, mixed-market economy.

They know their opinion counts and the apathy of the younger generations is self defeating. Of course your voice isn't heard if you don't stand for anything.

That aside, I think there is a problem with removing the incentive of profit from drug and treatment discovery. I work with a few early stage drug development companies and the cost of researching them is phenomenal. Every stage of development is extraordinarily expensive and time consuming, partially because of the regulation but also because of equipment, staffing, legal etc. My point is that these costs are absorbed by private companies because there is the incentive for massive profit. Remove that and drug discovery would collapse.  No government has that kind of money to spare on their own research. 

Don't get me wrong, I still think that there needs to be regulation on price points when treatments are released. Naked profiteering off a drug that could stop someone dying is so ruthless it makes my blood boil and I know there are ways that the system could be improved but it's not as simple as removing profit from the equation.

How do you not know this if you're from the UK? (EDIT: I see you've just changed your flair from Scotland to Canada... hmmm) 

And I can repeat my original point that although the guys were of Nigerian blood, their religion and way of life was Muslim, which is a lifestyle of Middle Eastern origin.  

So my point is, they're all Muslims. The Rigby killers and the shits in this article. You can make of that what you will, but the term 'Asian' means from Pakistan, which as a country that is 96% Muslim. Other countries are officially included, but in common conversation, People will say 'Indian' when referring to Indians, and 'Asian' when referring to the Middle East.

On The Daily Telegraph and Lord Tim Bell's reaction to her book:

&gt; *Bringing in the police for an investigation ... immediately exposes them to ridicule. These people don't know how to read fiction, they were professionally outraged.*

On David Camerons criticism of her remarks about Princess Kate:

&gt; *He was misguided in being rushed into comment about something he knew nothing of. It was unwise.*

On public debate in the UK:

&gt; *The quality of public discourse is low. There is a disposition in this country at the moment to take offense. It seems as if it's become a hobby for people to wait around for someone to express an opinion they don't like and then to react violently.*

On her experience living in the middle east:

&gt; *What we take to be true, by axiom, is not taken to be true there. Freedom of speech, which all in the West understand to be desirable, is not necessarily something envied or admired in the Muslim world.*

Regarding the UK's obsession with immigration, and retreat from the EU:

&gt; *It's a retreat into insularity, into a mood of harshness. When people feel they're being mistreated, they lash out against people who are weaker than themselves, immigrants for example. What's happening here at the moment is really ugly. The government portrays poor and unfortunate people as being morally defective. This is a return to the thinking of the Victorians. Even in the 16th century, Thomas Cromwell was trying to tell people that a thriving economy has casualties and that something must be done by the state for people out of work. Even back then, you saw the tide turning against this idea that poverty was a moral weakness. Who could have predicted that it would come back into style? It's myth making on a grand scale, and it's poisonous.*

On UKIP popularity:

&gt; *The populist party UKIP is on the rise; it's the party at the moment for people who are angry. They may not know what they're angry about, but they're going around declaring their intention to vote for UKIP as if that's going to make everyone terrified.*

On the economy (the source of the anger) and austerity:

&gt; *It has taken quite a while for people to see that it wasn't just a matter of a year or two. Transport, gas, electricity, housing: All those things that one must have are significantly more expensive. Wages remain low while the government is freezing and cutting benefits...*

&gt; *Unfortunately, it's the very people who protest the loss of their public services that go to vote for the Conservatives, as if they don't see the tie-up.*",0,1415868193,null,0,false,0,cm187mi,t3_2m4dcx,t1_cm187mi,t3_2m4dcx,null,1426048480,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

He almost always ignores things like economic and geopolitical pressures, which play a much larger role in history than the ideas of Ayn fucking Rand.  Specifically, anyone who neglects entirely the role of oil in a history of politics in the middle east is ignoring a very big elephant in a very small room.

Also his solution to just about everything is the return to ""big ideas"" and worthy politicians, as if the 1950's was some kind of dream world, which to my mind is reductionist bullshit which ignores the incredibly complex and interconnected nature of the world, and ultimately how often political ideals take a backseat to economic necessity.

That's not to say however, that you can't just outright do your licence and get a cruiser you want. But before you do, you need to think of what you need the bike for. A cruiser might not be the best city bike. Do you really think you could filter well on a big lump? Don't get me wrong I want one one day for doing some road trips, but for the city you can't beat a naked or sports bike. 

A commuter bike will by all intents and purposes be what you ride to and from work. A Yamaha R6 is a sports bike, and you could use it just fine for city riding, filtering etc. however the riding position might get a bit uncomfortable after a while. A naked bike like a KTM Duke (390, 690, 990, 1290) can be awesome for the city with an upright, comfortable position, and a good turning circle that can be really useful on the city. I sometimes struggled to do a U-Turn in the road on my YZF-R125.

If you're commute is on the motorways, you might want a fully faired bike to help with wind. Naked bikes can get a little uncomfortable at 80+ mph

A 4lb unexpected weight gain can mean the difference between going out or not going out.

For whatever reason it's not in the public consciousness, but since about 2010 we've been living through an oil shock.  Now the conservative ideology hasn't helped, nor has the borderline puritanical obsession with the deficit, but oil is the lifeblood of the economy and the last 4 years of $100+ oil have almost certainly been a contributing factor in the economic malaise.  Quite why there isn't a greater awareness of this is really baffling to me, though I suspect it's a combination of factors involving oil companies and governments not particularly enjoying raising the spectre of peak oil for fear of market reaction, the fact it's a complex and slow moving phenomenon and thus is of no interest to the news media and party because stories about resource depletion and graphs of prices and production rates and the discussion of the role of energy in the economy is fucking boring.

&gt;I think Dempsey, for all his flaws, provided more Premier League goals than Soldado has. 

Don't play in the same position, Soldado is a striker Dempsey was not used as a striker.

&gt;I think that Sandro and Livermore could both do the job that Capoue does

They are not the same, Sandro does not offer what Capoue does going forward and he gets injured (as shown by his injury celebrating a goal in training for QPR). Livermore got time near the end of 12/13 with all the injuries, didn't impress.

&gt;it's that collectively we have shifted out a lot of players (many of them loyal, long-term Spurs players) and have replaced them with players who are no better or are a bit worse.

Because that's obviously the plan. Soldado scored 81 goals in the 3 seasons for Valencia pre-Spurs averaging 27 a season in 141 total matches. And since you compared him to Dempsey, 2 years younger. Dempsey's goal scoring record 3 seasons prior was 45 in 132, Soldado being almost 1.7x that. Yes this isn't FIFA, yes there are various things you can't control (settling in, team chemistry, what a player likes to play with, league differences, family etc etc) but how in the hell are you supposed to guess Soldado would go from 27/season to struggling to get 10+?",0,1415873920,null,0,false,0,cm198j9,t3_2m62wv,t1_cm198j9,t3_2m62wv,null,1426048002,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

Dempsey was basically exactly the same as whats Chadli has been for us this season. Never did too much, wasn't ever amazing, but would always pop up and score.    
  
Caulker is an odd one. He was playing reasonably well for us, is good from set pieces, young and English. Very odd we sold him, the fact it happened so fast and with almost no rumours or warning beforehand leaves me to be inclined to believe the rumours that there was some off the pitch personal reasons why we sold him.  
  
Siggy. Well I don't think I've met another fan yet that wanted him gone, I think most understood why he would go though. Despite scoring / playing well for us, he wasn't playing that often and had to play on the wing a lot. I think it was better for him as a player that he went, but I do wish we'd kept him.  
  
I guess the other big player we sold would be Holtby, I don't feel like he ever impressed hugely outside of Europa games. But he was one of those players that the crowd loved and always gave the impression that he cared a lot. I think that of him and Siggy, selling one would have been fine, selling both looks like a mistake to me.

The global population is already far too high, and I fear that feeding the world will be the least of our problems in a few decades.

We already have the tools to address overpopulation, if we only had the political will - we know that people have fewer kids when they have education and social security, for example.

I'm not saying that we should rule out GM forever, but there are already numerous test projects all over the world.

I just don't understand why you'd advocate for rushing in GM crops if you're not financially invested in them - surely the best result you can hope for is £5 a week saving on your grocery bill.

Even if GM crops gave double the yields (they won't) that wouldn't result in halving the price of the price of food, due to the costs of planting, harvesting, transport, retail and so on.

Anything you might say about GM crops saving the developing world - that's stuff we could be doing anyway, if we really wanted to. We turn our backs on wars and genocides all the time, whilst western nations do their best to profit off Bangladeshis working in garment sweatshops.

If India and the Philippines really want to try growing vitamin-enchanced rice then I guess we can't stop them, but the people who'll primarily profit from this is Monsanto. 

You mention climate change, and we should know from all the other pollution we've done in the past, too, that such large scale change always has unintended consequences.

You've talked about all the benefits of GM crops, but we don't even know what they downsides will be - the only thing we can be sure of is that there will be some.

I'm not saying we should ban GMO research or anything crazy like that, I just think we should be wary - a caution you *never* see expressed here on Reddit, where GM crops are part of an evangelical ""science will cure all ills"" narrative - and take it really slow.

You could say that only Coutinho and Sterling have been performing at an acceptable level, couple of others, too, with good performances here or there. But even they have had periods of sub-par performances. Tactics won't make a player with low confidence and form play better - even with great tactics it takes time to get out of the ""slump"".

And Balotelli is played in lone strikers position because he is probably the best lone striker we have available at the moment. The problem is that it isn't his best position and he hasn't picked up any form yet. Playing someone with him requires sacrifices that Rodgers probably doesn't want to make. Our other forwards probably aren't good enough to warrant a position up top and Sterling is much more useful in different positions to waste him in the strikers position.

Even if Sturridge isn't in form when coming back, he'll still be good enough to play the lone striker or warrant a place as the 'first' striker in front of Balotelli. He's quick, has great technique and is sharp with the ball. So the situation most likely gets tons better than it is now.

You could say that it seems like a one man team or a team who's overly relying on one player. So, who isn't a one man team nowadays apart from the biggest clubs?

&gt;But in general, I don't think the two things are totally symmetrical and you can compare them so blindly, on the ""principle"" that a joke against men is just the same as a similar joke against women.

Ok so it seems to me like you endorse the idea that the two things are not equal which I would contend is in itself a sexist position. To make my position clear here, I think a person should be able to make any joke they bloody well want to, man or woman. I don't think we should ban racist jokes either, I think racism is probably the closest analogy to this whole sexism debate. I had a really hard think about it and I think we would all agree that some racist jokes can be very distasteful, however then I realised I had seen plenty of comics who took the piss out of on culture, or group race or religion where it was funny and not so jarring. I suppose what I am getting at is that comedians will live or die by their material and they don't need Armchair keyboard warriors telling them what the can and can't say, if the audience don't like it they will sharp find out.


&gt;If a woman were up on stage making jokes about divorce and denying her ex access to his kids, by making up stories about him being abusive, then I might concede that that promotes a harmful narrative about the way men should be treated. I doubt you'd be defending a woman who joked that ""kids don't need a father, anyway"". 

I would defend her right to make jokes as I just explained, I am sure there are comedians who have made jokes in that ball park, frankly I don't feel like it is right to censor somebody based on weather they are correctly contributing to the cultural narrative.

&gt;Jokes about rape are harmful because rapists genuinely believe that everyone else is at it - that it was just ""last minute resistance[1] "", that it's somehow ""not really rape because…"" or that most other guys are getting away with it, too.

Oh come on, the only reason those kind of jokes about rape work and are so shocking is because it is an unquestioned shared moral standard that rape is wrong. We all know that, even rapists know that.

&gt;There certainly is a cultural narrative that women shouldn't be in certain kinds of jobs (""they just don't have a natural aptitude for computer programming"")

Is there..? Or is it just that most women don't choose those jobs and in fact tend to prefer other jobs? I have worked in IT for 15 years and I have never heard anybody express doubt over the ability of females to learn to program (we do have female devs here too). On this topic there was an interesting Horizon about the male brain vs female brain debate I recommend you watch which does touch on this topic quite a bit IIRC.

&gt;or that they're a ""slut"" if they dress in certain ways, and that's why I think one needs to take a thoughtful attitude toward sexism. 

I don't agree that narrative comes from anywhere but other women quite frankly and they all seem to have a different take on it. For some women it's empowering (see the slutwalk) for others it's objectification for the benefit of 'misogynists'. As for society as a whole, yes people in general make judgements based on appearance and I agree a thoughtful attitude is certainly required which is why I disagree with bandying words around and declaring everybody a 'woman hater'.

&gt;I accept that I don't know what it's like to be a woman, but I don't care so much whether this cultural narrative is the product of ""hatred"" or indifference - I just don't think it helps to split hairs over the pocket dictionary definition of a single word.

I disagree with you profoundly, you can't let people just change the meaning of words like that and retain the emotional impact. If we allow people to just go around labelling everything incorrectly eventually the word will simply lose all meaning and impact. I'm  getting to the point now that as soon as I hear the word 'misogyny' or 'patriarchy' I am already making negative assumptions about the poster before I can even examine the argument. that being said, the people who throw that word around usually make shit arguments so what does it matter?

They actually farm it out to their offices in India these days. You use compliance work to create relationships so you can sell the good stuff, ""consultancy"", that's where the real money is. Do you want a complicated legal structure to funnel money through a bunch of tax havens and pay no tax on billions in profits? Do you want to put your executives up in £100,000 per year apartments in Knightsbridge and not pay tax on that? (Actually HMRC took them to court over that one and won). Do you want a special deal negotiated that exempts your company from paying tax on something (or practically everything)? That sort of thing is done by a relatively small number of people, who are indeed very proud and very professional.

But no amount of professionalism is going to erase a conflict of interest. There's one thing and one thing only that advances your career and that's making money for the firm. ""Donating"" £600,000 worth of work (you can get a lot of consulting for that kind of money) does not make money for the firm. Selling advice to clients that exploits the loopholes that you put in does. They are basically playing both ends. The losers in this are ""the government"" who have to make up the shortfall in revenue by squeezing those chumps too poor to afford the services of good tax advisers.

He basically says, we've got lots of space at other airports, so we're fine.  Hell he even anecdotally praises Southend, without realising why it's empty.

He ignores how many passengers flights from LHR are transit, he miss-uses the statistics about leisure flights
&gt;the vast majority of flights (between 70-75%) are short-haul leisure flights.

This isn't true as the it's 70% of the flights are to western Europe from the LGA report he stole the map from.  So basically he's confused the two, whilst leisure makes up something like 65% of the demand, it doesn't make up 100% of the short haul flights.

He also ignores how this is changing, with more emphasis on long haul.

I'm a watcher of this, because as a PPL I get effected by the airspace changes, it's important to remember that a decade ago, it was all about having massive hubs, which you would fly 747-8/a380s from.   However it turned out it's about the 777, these mid-sized long distance.  As such planning demands have changed a lot.

It's a very tricky business to have such a crystal ball, but one thing is clear, having more flights makes business easier.  Someone was asking why we based our company in London rather than Singapore or Hong Kong, the answer we gave was access to the important capital cities for our industry.  Having it so that it's a 5pm from LHR or 7pm from *London* Oxford International, doesn't make this easier.

However, I do think the form a lot of the criticism is taking is borne out of fear and ignorance rather than healthy skepticism - I hear a lot more 'it's not natural to take genes from one thing and put them in something else' that 'the mechanisms and effects of horizontal gene transfer in complex organisms is not well understood'. 

There is definitely a harmful disconnect between academic and public discourse to the extent where I, someone in academia themselves (although an unrelated field) have no idea about what geneticists who actually know what they're talking about think about Monsanto and the widespread implementation of GM.

There is a reason why it closed, reopening it won't solve that. Plymouth city handled around 0.2% of the traffic Heathrow handles, no amount of investment into airports such as Plymouth City would ever be a viable economic option to the creation of new capacity at Heathrow, or even capacity generation in the South East.

Aviation is a major economic driver in the UK. Aviations projected growth is far above what most people would expect. The fact is, without expansion of some sort, either by capacity expansion in the South East or creating viable alternatives at other airports, there is a real risk that aviation growth could be limited, risking an industry which directly contributes £18bn to the economy (and another £17.5bn indirectly) seems short sighted to me.

That's the fun thing about consent isn't it?  When is it given, is it verbal, explicit?

I used to think that a girl coming back to my room was consent, I think many teenagers are similarly inexperienced.  I guess I learned my lesson about communication in freshers week, when a girl came back with me for nothing more than a cuddle.  This I think crushed me, I felt rejected sexually, emasculated by her lack of desire.  I even cried a little bit  Mostly because I thought her purpose of coming back with me was for sex, so if I was rejected it must be due to something I'd done, or something about me.  I was such a delicate little flower back then!

Which is my point about consent, I've seldom had someone tell me that they are going to have sex with me, before we've had sex.

18 year old me certainly didn't understand people well enough to delineate these things, that a girl might come back to your room, take her top off, want to kiss and nothing more, she doesn't want any more intimacy.  That someone might be up for vanilla stuff, but not even oral, that some might just want oral.  To me I saw things simply.  They'd consented, that means anything's OK unless they say no.

I'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, but the idea of fucking someone who's passed out, that... that's just a bit creepy to me.

Perhaps not, but GM technology is not just for us, it's for the benefit of the world. The global population is going to grow to about 10 billion thanks to drastic reductions in infant mortality in poorer countries. We are going to have to feed these people by about 2050 on about the same land area as we use today, using limited fertiliser, water and pesticides and in the context of a rapidly-changing climate.

Because poverty is being decreased, we're looking at a global demand increase of well over 100% by mid-century (this figure was published last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences).

So we have to grow more on limited land with limited resources (water, nitrogen for fertilisers, pesticides, etc.)

The other thing to point out is that GM crops can (and have been shown to) lead to a reduction in the use of pesticides.

&gt; If India and the Philippines really want to try growing vitamin-enchanced rice then I guess we can't stop them, but the people who'll primarily profit from this is Monsanto.

Farmers in Western nations wouldn't buy seed from large agrochemicals if they didn't also profit. The fact that there is a demand for GM seed should prove that it is a worthwhile technology.

With regards to golden rice, estimates are that it could save [thousands](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/865946.stm) of children from vitamin A deficiency-related blindness and death each year. So they're clearly profiting. The golden rice patents were given away for free.

&gt; You've talked about all the benefits of GM crops, but we don't even know what they downsides will be - the only thing we can be sure of is that there will be some.

If she's 19, drunk and it's 4am she probably can't be relied on to give informed consent.  If you sneak up and take sloppy seconds after your mate had a go whilst other mates film it, your a cunt and as the court decided, a rapist. 

footballers get away with a lot of shit. it's about time someone called them on it. 

edit - there's some idiots on this sub. so lets start at the begining.

&gt;So all the women at universities have been raped? - clearly not. I doubt all woman at uni go to bed with one man and wake up with a totally different one after being filmed without their knowledge. 

&gt;So you are basically saying, anyone that is pissed after drinking and leaving a nightclub past .. what should we say 'midnight' cannot have sex, as it will not be informed consent? Is that what you are basically implying? - there's a big difference between midnight and 4am. midnight is pub closing time and a kebab. 4am is a club with cheap alcohol and probably an indication of a severely shitfaced person. but way to take my words and twist em. good job.

&gt;So basically half the young males that get laid in this country are rapists? Is that what you're saying? - If your having sex with a girl who is either so shitfaced or drugged she cannot remember doing anything then your making shit life decisions and have little regard for the woman. rapists? possibly not, they may have got consent right at the start of the night? douches of the highest order? definitely.

&gt;It follows that anyone leaving a club at closing time should not, under any circumstances, go home and have sex. - yes because this circumstance is the only circumstance that happens. idiot.

&gt;The point of contention is that people are comparing someone who was invited for sex by a friend - yes, **by a friend**. not the woman he had sex with. hence hes a rapist. If i get a text from a mate saying ""hey come round and have sex"" I would expect it to be with that friend. If i turn up and he offers me a barely conscious or very drunk partner I'm walking out. it's not a fucking difficult decision and yet some people seem to think it is.

Sure, you might argue that only 10% of LHR is transit passengers (that is, they've flown in because LHR is not their final destination), but often the difference between a loss making route and a profitable one is much less than 10%.

Look at all the airlines, none of them are making much profit on routes.  So it's very risky to open one, you want to make sure you will have good demand.

There are two kinds of passenger movements, scheduled and charter.  Scheduled are regular routes, Charter are often underwritten by a travel agency, they happen very ad-hock, often in tourist season only.  The line between the two is a lot less than say 20 years ago, but it still explains the thinking of operators.  Most want to avoid charter, as the cash flow is sporadic, they want the regular repeat business.  Airports like Southend have more charter, as there is less risk than committing the resources for scheduled operations.

This means that they have little regular business users, I think they've a route to Schippol, but that is using it as access to a hub (ie a lot of them will be transit).

Anyway, I just watched some of a game of yours when you were Magnus mid. Off the bat a couple things surprised me. I would have definitely favoured Morphling in the matchup but that shouldn't stop Magnus from missing as many last hits as you did. Your item build was good as it could've been Rubick mid I guess. For that reason I was surprised you decided not to put a single point into Empower as that makes last hitting trivially easy at lower levels for Magnus. The problem was it was 18 minutes in and you only had 40 last hits which is pretty abysmal for a mid player. Most good mid/carry players have around 50 at 10 minutes, I get around 44 - 49, when there at most 82 in 10 minutes to even get... not counting the catapults. Fair enough if you had of been ganking then you wouldn't have that much CS but you must have come to lane about 3 times tried to do the same impale trick on Morphling just to have him swim away and then died to either one of his allies, a tower or Morphling himself after putting yourself in a bad position with your impale. 

Also it was quite clear that you weren't very concerned for your own mana. One time you tried to get Rubick and you spent the last of your mana at a time where an experienced player would've realised it wouldn't have killed him anyway and then unfortunately you got ganked by Morphling whilst you had no mana for an impale getaway. True it was unfortunate but you can't afford to get greedy when you're already 0/3.

If I died mid and had a bottle I wouldn't go straight back to lane and be as aggressive as I was when we were both level. That extra bit of gold and xp from your death might not seem very significant to you but that could be an ultimate for the enemy mid hero or 100 more damage for Morphling's wave which makes it that much easier to harass and kill you again. Or it could even be phase boots or power treads which would making it easier for them to escape you and harder for you to escape them. It might all sound very obvious, or not at all, but the way you were going (I stopped when you got to 1/4) I could see the game either ending with you with being like 3/8/5 (probably a defeat) or like 9/9/12 (probably a victory, hard fought) with the way you were playing. 

Second off I was pretty surprised of who you were spending all your spells on. Morphling. If I was in this matchup I would have definitely given up on trying to kill the opposing mid with Impales at least. I would've done the same as you and spammed him with Qs just so he wasn't getting completely uncontested freefarm. 

Even with the build you had you would've been an absolute wrecking ball if you had of just ganked bottom. In fact seeing as you didn't level empower at all early on that suggests you either followed a build for a ganking Magnus or like having those skills being quite powerful which I agree can be sick in the right situation. Top was pretty ungankable as it was Rubick and AM... but CM was just asking for it. True they had wards but all you'd have to do would be to buy a TP and port directly to the tower for possibly a double kill. 

Anyway enough about the one game. Things you can definitely work on:
1. Can't stress importance on CS enough especially as a carry or mid player. Helpful tip which helped me is, importance: 1. Last hit for yourself. 2. Harassing out of lane. 3. Denying. If you can combine 1&amp;2 with heroes like Magnus or DP all the better because then you'll be in a good position to get the runes too. Another good tip for heroes which can clear waves quickly is before the minute mark for the rune spawning kill all the minions asap so that the enemy hero then has to decide whether to give up the xp and gold from that wave or go and get a rune whereas you are free to get a rune without losing out on that. Even better if you then combine that with 1&amp;2 the other hero will just feel completely outplayed.
2. Know when you're not going to win your lane, if you're not change it up, gank enemy jungle or lanes, play a bit more passive until they make a mistake or if it's very bad then farm the jungle or ask for a gank. INSTEAD of just feeding the mid hard, if you can kind of predict you losing the lane anyway then you can't stay there and expect to win outright. Morphling would've been easier to deal with if he had of been shut down early on.
3. Don't waste mana/skills unnecessarily, focus a lot on hitting your skill shots.
4. Be a bit more aware of the enemy's movements. You got ganked whilst ganking a few times and that is probably just down to not looking at the minimap and realising they're out of lane when you go to gank.


If you want to get really good mid/good in general, then ignore me because I'm only 3.5k mmr but can 100% dominate people who are at 3k and below and go watch a streamer like Merlini or watch some AngryTestie play HoN. It maybe HoN but it's pretty much the same game and all the same strategies apply, he is one of the best mid players I've ever seen and he has a lot of educational videos on youtube where he plays mid and dominates even in a lane where he knows his hero is unfavoured to win the matchup.

false,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"&gt; London pays it's way in terms of tax, infact moreso. It makes sense to put money into infrastructure in London if it means it can subsidise the rest of the country.

But that's exactly my point - the government puts London on a pedestal, it prospers because of the investment pumped into it, and the loop of investment/prosperity continues while the rest of the country is told that it is lucky that London ""subsidises"" them and that they can put up with their aging overloaded infrastructure - so they'll never have any chance of competing with London

That leads to other problems like the utterly screwed London/SE property market and overcrowding - when there's masses of housing and land outside of London that could be put to use. It must be great as a Londoner to be effectively locked out of ever buying a house (which is also sort of true down here as property prices are out of whack with incomes - just not insanely so)

Other countries like Germany have proven that you don't need to put all of your eggs into one basket.

&gt; Cornwall's infrastructure is awful, I totally agree. The fact it doesn't have a proper train line and a motorway down there is an absolute joke and is actively preventing the area from developing. Getting those in and latching on to the south west's Techspark initiative would go a long way to improving things down there. 

It's pretty bad for Devon too (except Exeter). Plymouth is treated as some rural backwater, not as a city comparable in status to Southampton (population wise) or larger towns like Reading.

For Cornwall, it has taken years for the government/council to agree to upgrade a 2 mile stretch of road to a dual carriageway to eliminate an ancient bottleneck that should never have existed (it should have been dualled when the rest of the road was). I don't see any chance of any serious investment happening ever.

false,honey_pie,null,null,"&gt;Yeah it was

I have now read that case summary.. whether or not it was rape depends on the opinion of the jury of how drunk she was-- specifically that a loss of memory does not necessarily equate to a loss of ability to choose (consent).

judge:

&gt; ""A complainant consents if, and only if, she has the freedom and capacity to make a choice, and she exercised that choice to agree to sexual intercourse.""

&gt; ""There are two ways in which drink and/or drugs can affect an individual who is intoxicated. First, it can remove inhibitions. A person may do things when intoxicated which she would not do, or be less likely to do if sober. Secondly, she may consume so much alcohol and/or drugs that it affects her state of awareness. So you need to reach a conclusion upon what was the complainant's state of intoxication, such as you may find it to be. Was she just disinhibited, or **had what she had taken removed her capacity to exercise a choice?**""

&gt; ""was she in a condition in which she was capable of making any choice one way or another? If you are sure that she was not, then she did not consent. If, on the other hand, you conclude that she chose to agree to sexual intercourse, or may have done, then you must find the defendants not guilty.""

In response to the complaint from CE that the judge had not highlighted the possibility of drunken consent:

&gt;He went on to direct the jury about the requirement relating to the individual defendant's belief about whether or not the complainant was consenting. He gave clear directions to the jury about how they should approach that issue in the context of the alcohol which had been consumed by the complainant.

&gt;The court said that those directions to the jury amply encapsulated the concept of the **drunken consent amounting to consent**.

&gt;**The judge did not use those express words**; there was no obligation on him to do so. On occasions when those words are used or the issue is put in that way, **it causes umbrage and indeed distress**.

It strikes me that to an extent the judge shied away from properly clarifying the position because he didn't want to offend anybody.

If the jury took these to statements to include drunken consent, I don't personally see from what I've read how this comes out, without reasonable doubt, to rape in the eyes of the law.

also relevant, Professor John Birch, a consultant pharmacologist, a professor of biomedical science specialising in psycho-pharmacology (for the defence):

&gt;""**the fact that she does no longer remember having made a decision is a failure of the memory process and not of the decision-making process. Evidence of memory loss as a result of anterior-grade amnesia does not in itself prove that she lacked the capacity to consent.**""

A previous expert called by the defence..

&gt;..calculated that the complainant's likely blood-alcohol level at about 4am [time of intercourse] would have approximated to something like **2½ times the legal driving limit**

As for the difference between CE and CM, the only way I can find any difference is in if they were reasonable to *believe* that the woman consented. CM had greater grounds to believe that given that she had come back with him, and

Is it overloaded though? I mean... I go from Crewe in the midlands to lots of the north as part of work and most of the trains I get are totally empty two carriage trains.

Geography matters. Germany also had the benefit of the US supporting them for decades.

Ironically, what you've just said is the antithesis of the trade union movement. You know, the one where every man acts in unison for a common (some might say corporate) goal, at the expense of individuality. What is exactly meant by prioritising 'the needs of individual people'? Who is prioritising what? Which individuals?

&gt;Go watch his youtube channel, he's very clear, he talks alot about what he supports

I'm subscribed to The Trews, but I fail to see a clear and consistent argument or platform (other than buy my book).

&gt;he talks alot about what he supports, the removal of mechanisms that create an elite corporate world who get use their clout to change laws and influence politics to suit themselves

Exactly, lots of non-specific, non-verifiable hand waving nonsense. Might you, the idea of someone in the position of public célébrité using their existing clout to influence people is not without a sense of irony.

&gt;I really don't have time for this whole ""Oh no! He uses long words!"" bollocks. Go read Kant, Neitzche, Descartes. Do we criticise them for using long words?

None of those authors deliberately used over engineered words and terms, in their time or ours. The subject matter was heavy reading, but Brand's vernacular is deliberately overreaching. It makes him look like the prat he is, and takes away from his perhaps otherwise accessible arguments.

&gt;people have spent entire careers dissecting exactly what Kant said and it's ramifications

Yeah because his philosophies used concrete rhetoric and were cross examinable, unlike ""the unknowable and undefinable **elite** control the world in ways we can't detect or prove"".

&gt;I'm just saying that criticizing him for the words he chooses is complete bollocks unless those words are wrong

The words make up the argument, and his argument is incoherent. At the same time I can slate him for is deliberately obtuse choice of language.

&gt;The difference between when he does it and you do it, is that when he does it, he forms sentences with meaning.

Good one, tell me another.

At the end of the day, saying that either has more right to be on a bus is problematic. Whoever is there first has automatic priority, in my view. If it is possible for them to accommodate the person that comes later then they should do that.

Dear MP / Prospective MP

On Monday the 24th of November NHS staff in England And Northern Ireland are to strike again. This follows years of pay freezes and caps with Jeremy Hunt still refusing to meet to settle this dispute leaving our most valuable public servants with no choice but to take further action. 

Unions taking action are GMB, Unison, Unite, UCATT, Society of Radiographers, Royal College of Midwives, POA, Managers in Partnership, British Association of Occupational Therapists, British Dietetic Association, and Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association.

GMB conducted an official ballot of 22,000 members in the NHS in England and Northern Ireland. There was overwhelming support for industrial action against the government’s and employers’ pay policies. The pay offer is an unconsolidated 1% pay award in 2014 restricted to staff not eligible for incremental progression, and the same approach in 2015. This goes against the recommendation of the independent NHS Pay Review Body for a 1% consolidated pay rise for all staff.

I hope you, will support the strike in person or in spirit and will lend your voice to the voiceless and ignored health workers of our nation by writing to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt urging him to meet with the Unions and reach a fair resolution.

I also hope you could confirm that you support a publicly funded and run NHS, and would appreciate if it you could confirm you agree with the following statements to clarify your position. 

1:  Private Finance Initiative (PFI) should be scrapped, existing contracts should be renegotiated or brought out at the soonest possible opportunity.

2: No hospital closures should not take place in West Yorkshire over the course of the next Parliament.

3: We should support and expand local A&amp;E and maternity provision in the region.

4: We should fully oppose the EU-USA trade deal (TTIP) that makes NHS privatisation irreversible while it contains any ISDS clauses, acknowledging that any attempt to exempt the NHS from such a deal will be futile while such a clause exists

5: Ensure adequate staffing in hospitals, GP practices &amp; community care. We should listen to concerns from NHS staff &amp; patients to improve the NHS, and take greater steps to ensure whistle-blowers are protected and empowered to speak out.

6: A two or multi-tier heath service with uneven standards and service provision is immoral and unacceptable, the marketisation of the NHS should be undone with the abolition foundation status hospitals / trusts and their reintigration back into the NHS.

7: Health care services should be free at the point of delivery for all service users, means testing should not be required to access services.

I would appreciate a clear yes or no answer to each point, and while any elaboration on your reasoning would be welcome, the clarity of your position on these matters is of paramount importance with the General Election taking place in the next six months.

Many thanks

I don't quite understand what you are trying to say here. The case brought against her was that she lied. Thus, if there was no evidence that she lied then the case should not have been brought. 

It seems that you are trying to say that because there is no evidence that the guy wasn't telling the truth, it was fine to bring the prosecution. This clearly doesn't make sense. We don't convict people based on the fact that there is no evidence that their accuser is lying. Otherwise, he'd have been convicted in the first place. 

The overall purpose of a court is kind of to determine 'the truth', but in reality the purpose of a criminal trial is to establish whether there is evidence proving 'beyond reasonable doubt' that a person committed the crime that they are accused of. If that standard of evidence clearly cannot be met, as it clearly could not in the present case, then a prosecution should not be brought. The trial is for balancing the prosecution's strong evidence against the defendant's own evidence. If the police say that there is no evidence, then a trial isn't even meant to happen because the prosecution should catch it.

&gt;__Birmingham Curzon Street railway station__ (formerly __Birmingham station__) was a [railway station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_station) in [Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham), England, used by scheduled passenger trains between 1838 and 1854 when it was the [terminus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_station) for both the [London and Birmingham Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_and_Birmingham_Railway) and the [Grand Junction Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Junction_Railway), with lines to [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London) and to [Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester) and [Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool) respectively. It was then used for excursions until 1893 and goods traffic until 1966 when it closed. More recently, the surviving [Grade I listed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_I_listed) entrance building has been used for occasional art events.

false,iheke,null,null,"I think much of thinking in this thread is wrong. Soldado is a striker who has played his entire senior football career as a lone striker in front of an attacking three. From Michel at Getafe (early) in his career, to Emery, Pellegrini and Voro at Valencia (I hope you spotted Pellegrini there and what he's done for Aguero either working as a lone one or as a two with Negredo). The key point, he was the perfect striker for either AVB's or Poch's systems.

I would urge caution looking at these spider charts because it is very easy to reach the conclusion that he is getting worse. When I think a few more interesting things are going on.

1. His numbers improved markedly from Getafe to Valencia because he was moving to dramatically better teams. Getafe is the PL equivalent of mid table (think Newcastle rather than Stoke) and he moved to Valencia who were the equivalent of moving to one of the top 4 (Valencia were consistently 3rd placed while he was there) so there is a degree of ""team effects"" to his numbers.

2. The interesting thing is what coming to the PL has done to his shooting numbers. At Valencia in his final season he managed to fire off 100 shots with 51% accuracy and 90 of them were from inside the box. Last year he only managed 58 shots but his accuracy fell to 31% - the vast majority (52) came from within the box, but even then most of the analyst community were already noticing that he isn't shooting enough. A good example for me of what he should be doing for us was Aguero's first goal against us. He is waiting for us to make his chances rather than making them for himself which was a regular feature of his game in the box in Spain.

3. The weird thing is his possession has remained rock solid - not that anyone will listen and the logic will continue that a big man is better at retaining possession - and his passing, in particular his assists and key passes are getting better.

TL:DR Something about the PL has made Soldado shoot less and this is affecting all round game (including scoring) I think someone (Poch) and convince him to shoot more (like Townsend) and I'd guess his goal tally would improve markedly. He's no Torres (yet).",0,1415884520,null,0,false,0,cm1bc2u,t3_2m4e94,t1_cm1bc2u,t1_cm0yp2j,null,1426046965,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

&gt;Oh joy these zero hour contracts sound really great!!

Do you not think people who refuse to work overtime in salaried positions are even penalised for that? Removing zero hour contracts will not fix this problem. 

&gt;It also nice to note that only 52% were content with amount of time the got given work wise. So basically you have 50/50 chance being screwed on hours.
Which just circles back to the fact that zero hour contracts are not great for people in general.

Which actually circles back to that fact that zero hour contracts are perfect for the majority of people on them.

Again, if you want to discuss this properly. Anecdotes are worthless - zero hour contracts are an easy target because they are easy to make look bad. If you look at the actual statistics and what people want - the **majority** are happy on them. 

And of course you didn't decide to copy and paste the very first line from the article

&gt;UK workers on zero-hours contracts are more likely to be happy with their work-life balance than other staff, a survey suggests.

So the proposed solution is to make zero hour contract workers, less happy? 

And why? Because people hear something and decide that its bad without considering the consequences or the facts.

A large costly tube system makes sense in London due to it's dense nature. A similar system would be totally unfeasible and not required across a region like the South West.

Spending money on cycling infrastructure to cross the London region is cheaper, more practical, and more needed than spending it on infrastructure to cross the East Midlands.

The rest of the country is underfunded I agree but the demands are not equal. There's a reason why people want to fly into Heathrow and not Luton.

What facts though? From what has been written here they claim she *asked* for sexual activity with the convicted and changed her mind the following day (according to the defendants) and from her point of view she can't remember because she was drunk. 

So she says she didn't - they say she did. 

&gt; Is your potential partner drunk enough that people around you would desribe her as ""extremely drunk"" (see the Judge's summing up in this case)? 

My question there is *who can judge that well after the event, especially if there are no witnesses or any that are present are, themselves, drunk?*

I could go out for a meal with a girl, share a bottle of wine and retire to my place with one thing leading to another. If she then went on to claim that I plied her with alcohol and we were both smashed - what would my defense be? Where would the proof come from - especially if any alleged alcohol had had plenty of time to leave our systems?

""If I've bought something, can I change my mind?

Many of us have bought something only to later decide it's unsuitable or unneeded. Yet shops are under no obligation to take your goods back, just because you've changed your mind, only when they're faulty.

The exceptions to this are when buying on the internet, mail order or financial agreements, when you often have cancellation rights.

But even when you don't have rights, plenty of companies do still give refunds. These are mainly high street stores with returns policies allowing you to simply take back whatever you want within a set timeframe. You're less likely to be able to change your mind for a service contract that's started, though.

These goodwill policies have encouraged more and more customers to expect this as a right, even though it doesn't always apply. 

This doesn't mean you can't ask, though. Shops would rather keep customers happy than be sticklers for the rules. They consider all customers to be potential clients who will use their services or buy their products again and again.

I'll offer an example - say McDonald and the woman were in the missionary position when she was asked if he could join in. What does that mean?

It good to see you don't think it worrying that 1 in 5 get penalised for missing a shift when four in ten say they didn't even receive any notices of their shift. Yeah because potentially getting penalised for work you didn't know you had is such a plus side to a contract.

""Which actually circles back to that fact that zero hour contracts are perfect for the majority of people on them.""

52% is still pretty much 50/50, it barely qualifies as majority at all.

You talk about statistics. But the statistics on that survey from a small sample doesn't show any of the questions asked only the extrapolated data from that. Actual questions in surveys are very important as sometimes they can get very different results depending on what's and how it's being asked. It also only shows the views of those who they actually asked. It why they use word ""suggests"".

Also it tells us nothing about the type of positions those people questioned were evolved in. What their family and accommodation situation was like. What sort of hours were those who were content were getting. How reliable was amount of work they getting month in month out.

So far from that survey we get a 52% are content. That's about it.  You take from that the majority are happy. 48% seem to be getting royally shafted. But don't worry those 52% are ""happy"". Yet we have no idea why they're happy, are they a still living at parents Uni student who can work whatever hours need whenever because they don't need worry about child care or rent.  We don't know because the survey is very very limited.

What I do now is on leather gear (boots, jackets, trousers, gloves) use neatsfoot oil. Look to equestrian supply shops it's used on saddles. Whilst it won't make your leather gear 100% waterproof it encourages beading of the water which then blows off rather than soaking in. It has the additional benefit of making the leather really soft. I'd spend a little more and get the pure stuff, not blended. Also if the leather is lighter coloured it will darken it. It can take a few applications to saturate the leather for full benefit.

For my textile gear I use Fabsil Gold, put it in an empty kitchen/bathroom trigger spray type bottle and spray it all over paying particular attention to seams. Again it's not a 100% fix but encourages beading so the rain blows off before it can soak in. It works well on rucksacks/tankbags too. It's not compatible with all fabrics though so check.

I'm not sure you are correctly grasping how a trial works. It isn't a matter of someone saying 'he raped me!' and then the prosecution immediately takes the case. The police have to carry out a great deal of investigation and show to the prosecution that there is enough evidence for the possibility of a conviction. This is to stop prosecutions from easily being initiated by mere accusations (except where they are particularly convincing), save CPS resources and avoid frivolous prosecutions. By the time a case goes to trial, there should be a reasonable amount of evidence, which isn't to say that there should be irrefutable evidence. 

The problem therefore isn't that it is possible to prosecute someone for false accusation.

Plus you have to maintain it every year. The club don't give a shit if you've been going to 14+ games a season for the last decade. If you have *one* season where maybe there are a few clashes for you or some personal shit comes up and you can only get to 8 or 9 games, then you're off the bandwagon and are in the same boat as everyone else trying to get back on. The only exception is for Europe because there aren't that many games they can distinguish with and we weren't in Europe last season.

As another comment said, if it went ""13 games... 12 games... 11 games... etc"" then it would be a bit more fair, but it doesn't. You either qualify for the ridiculous criteria for guaranteed tickets or you don't and you're stuck with general sale even if you went to 9 games last season, because there's no differentiation for anything in between 14 games and no games. And there's no way you'll ever get enough games in a year through general sale to qualify for more than general sale the next season. Being local means you *could* go to more games, but you have no more guarantee of it than anyone else.

Is that a statement of actual UK law, or just what you think it ought to be? I am not a legal expert, so I am just repeating what the actual legal experts involved in the case stated.

Also [here is what the CPS website states](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/rape_and_sexual_offences/consent/#a04):

&gt; Deciding whether a belief is reasonable is to be determined having regard to all the circumstances, including any steps (A) has taken to ascertain whether (B) consents (subsection (2) of sections 1-4). It is likely that this will include a defendant's attributes, such as disability or extreme youth, but not if (s)he has any particular fetishes.

&gt; The Act abolished the Morgan defence of a genuine though unreasonably mistaken belief as to the consent of the complainant. The defendant (A) has the responsibility to ensure that (B) consents to the sexual activity at the time in question. It will be important for the police to ask the offender in interview what steps (s)he took to satisfy him or herself that the complainant consented in order to show his or her state of mind at the time.

&gt; The test of reasonable belief is a subjective test with an objective element. The best way of dealing with this issue is to ask two questions:

&gt; Did the defendant believe the complainant consented? This relates to his or her personal capacity to evaluate consent (the subjective element of the test).  
If so, did the defendant reasonably believe it? It will be for the jury to decide if his or her belief was reasonable (the objective element).",0,1415888811,null,0,false,0,cm1cqd1,t3_2m65rc,t1_cm1cqd1,t1_cm1cg48,null,1426046313,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

There was CCTV footage of her entering the hotel, and the testimony of the night porter. 

&gt; The effects of reduced inhibition from alcohol does not affect ability to consent. 

From the [CPS web page on rape](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/rape_and_sexual_offences/consent/#a03)

&gt; The question of capacity to consent is particularly relevant when a complainant is intoxicated by alcohol or affected by drugs.

&gt; In R v Bree [2007] EWCA 256, the Court of Appeal explored the issue of capacity and consent, stating that, if, through drink, or for any other reason, a complainant had temporarily lost her capacity to choose whether to have sexual intercourse, she was not consenting, and subject to the defendant's state of mind, if intercourse took place, that would be rape. However, where a complainant had voluntarily consumed substantial quantities of alcohol, but nevertheless remained capable of choosing whether to have intercourse, and agreed to do so, that would not be rape. Further, they identified that capacity to consent may evaporate well before a complainant becomes unconscious. Whether this is so or not, however, depends on the facts of the case.

...

&gt; Prosecutors and investigators should consider whether supporting evidence is available to demonstrate that the complainant was so intoxicated that he/she had lost their capacity to consent. For example, evidence from friends, taxi drivers and forensic physicians describing the complainant's intoxicated state may support the prosecution case.

They had a landlord on Radio 5 earlier who was very open and said it's a simple business decision: if you have 5 applicants for a property you can take your pick, and you'll always choose the most reliable option.  It's not just zero hours this affects... it's also people on housing benefit and self-employed people.  If you have a choice as a landlord between someone with a regular income (where it's easy to get a rent guarantee) and someone who has no guarantee of hours in a month it ends up being a very simple risk/reward decision.

The answer, of course, is to build more houses or for the government to underwrite the rent guarantee for zero hours workers (or provide council homes).

Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, 

Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs 

And towards our distant rest began to trudge. 

Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots 

But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind; 

Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots  

Of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.

Gas! Gas! Quick, boys! – An ecstasy of fumbling, 

Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time; 

But someone still was yelling out and stumbling, 

And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime. . . 

Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light, 

As under a green sea, I saw him drowning. 

In all my dreams, before my helpless sight, 

He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. 

If in some smothering dreams you too could pace 

Behind the wagon that we flung him in, 

And watch the white eyes writhing in his face, 

His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin; 

If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood 

Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, 

Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud  

Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues, 

My friend, you would not tell with such high zest  

To children ardent for some desperate glory, 

The old Lie; Dulce et Decorum est 

Pro patria mori.

We seem to be trying to play in a way that does not suit our players now, and we're suffering because of it.  Our second half of the 12/13 season was really good because we changed tactics to accommodate both Sturridge and Suarez.  When Suarez sampled some fine Serbian cuisine without consent and got himself banned, we didn't change our style and continued to play very well with Sturridge for the last few games of that season.

Start of the 13/14 campaign we ground out some really ugly 1-0 wins and looked generally kindof crappy yet lucky before dropping 5 points at Anfield to Swansea (D 2-2) and Soton (L 0-2).  Suarez then came back and we started looking dead sexy on the attack, so much so that it didn't matter we forgot how to defend as the season went on (6-3 Cardiff, 5-3 Stoke... no way should either of those teams be scoring 3 goals on us ever).

Now Suarez is gone, Sturridge has been injured for months, and our new boy up top doesn't fluorish as a lone striker nor does he like to play on his front foot.  We've changed our style drastically, back to something a lot more like what we tried to do at the start of 12/13 season.  You could see some improvements game by game in 12/13 though, whereas this season we seem to be getting worse or just staying the same with each match.  I don't think the system suits the players and we're suffering from that.  I really hope that once Sturridge is back we change tactics again and go back to the kind of very fast transitional play we were so good at last season and the second half of the previous season.  I think Rodgers is being a bit stubborn right now and it's hurting us, but I also think he's a very smart and observant man who will eventually come around and start to shake things up until he finds the right setup.

We have lots of very young new players who are pretty raw and will need a lot of time to get themselves fully acclimated to a new country, new league, and new team.  This season was always going to be a hard one.  I won't mind losing or drawing some games we maybe shouldn't be as long as we're showing the same kind of drive, desire, and hunger that we showed last season.  We haven't shown that at all this season (people point to the Spurs game as the one example and while we looked pretty good I think Spurs also played utter shit and helped us look better than we were), which is the scary thing.  We're playing bad, the players look uninterested, and we aren't showing signs of improving our mood or performances right now.

Also Hazard is 2 years younger.

Just LOL. Ronaldo is getting older but he won last years Ballon d'Or and is the favourite to win this years. Ronaldo won't be going anywhere for a while and has recently declared his desire to finish his career with Madrid. Like I said, Madrid are far more balanced and play better with either James or Isco on the wing because they compliment the team much better instead of just having Ronaldo on one wing and a carbon copy of Ronaldo on the other. 

I do think Hazard will end up replacing Ronaldo in 3/4 years but if Madrid want him any sooner than that it will be for Bale and if they do go for him in the summer it only makes sense that we go for Bale in return instead of allowing him to join United.",0,1415891523,null,0,false,0,cm1duzg,t3_2m69nk,t1_cm1duzg,t1_cm1da5z,null,1426045787,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

It's not that hard of a problem to solve either, most regulators in the UK or the US are people who worked for banks or will work for banks, how do you expect them to regulate properly when they have the bank's interests at heart? 

Governments don't let the banks fail and let them do anything the want. For years and years, we were warned about banks becoming too big and the financial crisis was just another opportunity for banks to merge and become even bigger than before.

Stop talking about banks like they're part of our economy, they're not, banks are for themselves and for their shareholders. They don't give a shit if you are unemployed, homeless, all they care about is making more money and they will achieve that goal even if it means cheating, defrauding and fucking people over.

1. The airport as is now, could in no way handle the sort of traffic required, the terminal is rubbish. Even with the M1 widening you mention which is great there is still essentially 1 access road to it, that in the mornings is an absolute joke to get through. A bus service to and from Parkway station would not be fit for purpose with the increased traffic.

2. The local situation with very expensive villages in the area full of wealthy residents, (hard to beleive I know) means a big backlash with well off people invovled. 

3. You can only extend the runway one way due the fact one end goes off a cliff basically, stilts I guess you could do but that impacts the IBC van making site and the access road. 

4. You still have the issue of major UK airlines having hubs set up at Heathrow, the cost to them to change bases would be very large, this is why airlines back the new runways at LHR and LGW. 

5. Similar to above from a passenger perspective the fact many of the connecting flights that people use an airport like Heathrow for, probably wouldnt transition over to Luton. 

Im local and would desperately like to see some development in the airport, god knows the town needs something right now with the Monarch job losses, but having worked in the industry for some time, its pretty clear to me that Luton isnt a feasible option, at least on its own it would have to be part of wider development that im still not entirely sure would work.

&gt;I do not understand this squeamishness about the use of gas. We have definitely adopted the position at the Peace Conference of arguing in favour of the retention of gas as a permanent method of warfare. It is sheer affectation to lacerate a man with the poisonous fragment of a bursting shell and to boggle at making his eyes water by means of lachrymatory gas.

&gt;I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes. The moral effect should be so good that the loss of life should be reduced to a minimum. It is not necessary to use only the most deadly gasses: gasses can be used which cause great inconvenience and would spread a lively terror and yet would leave no serious permanent effects on most of those affected.

Worked on a lot of stuff for the Olympics in London. Right now I have an entry level job in a factory and earn £22k/year. Very easy job, just physically demanding. 4 days on, 4 days off. If I do two days overtime a month, I make £25k/year. Not that bad when you think about it.

Another guy got his telehandler license and was earning £12/hour, for 50+ hours a week. Look into live events crews, they come in as hired labour and earn £10/hour minimum, if you go up a crew chief you can get £15/hour easily.    

Like others have said look at skills in demand, and see where you can fit in. The guy I know who went to do his telehandler license paid £400 or so for the test, passed then got a CPCS card (£40 maybe) and got a job almost straight away. £440 is a relatively small investment if it's going to land you a job paying £25,000/year.

I also haven't actually said that he has no right to pursue a private prosecution. The point is that the CPS apparently used public money to fund a public prosecution in which the police had said there was no evidence. They aren't meant to do that, hence there why there will be an inquiry to ascertain whether or not they acted wrongly. There may be evidence that they did not. 

Basically, the facts could be, on polar opposites:

1. He did not rape her and she made the whole thing up maliciously. He pursued a private prosecution and was able to provide new evidence that the Police did not have access to that conclusively showed that she was lying. 

2. He did rape her but there was insufficient evidence to convict him. He then used his wealth to pursue a £200,000 private prosecution in order to hound her enough to make sure that her and any future victims would be too afraid to speak up. He pressured the CPS into pursuing a public prosecution using his very expensive lawyers to bully some juniors. 

Both of those could be the case. In all likelihood, it is some mixture of both.

It leaves a bit to be desired as regards timing -- since you don't know how quickly a transfer happens you don't know what price you will get.  That on top of the 5% fee is a bit painful.  On the plus side though, they didn't do any crazy AML/KYC stuff (sensibly, since they get my bank account details from the transfer anyway, and the authorities could easily trace me from them if they came a knockin').  Also, it's incredibly straight forward.  

~~Register with email, reference code issued, you transfer to their bank using that code.
Additionally there is a slight insecurity in that the registration email is sent in the clear with your ""unique bitcoin wallet address"" in it -- nothing stops a dodgy email admin on the internet from changing that to their own address and collecting any bitcoin deposits you make.  Email should be GPG signed at least, with public key published on web site.~~ Duh.  That was my address, so it doesn't need securing.  However, I'd like to see signed emails anyway.

It could do with a bit more explanation about what happens if you transferred more than your daily limit; does it hold in an account -- where can I see that?  is it returned instantly; is it retained and spent to the daily limit until it's used up?

For comparison though, I did a $500 purchase from circle (the weekly limit) via a HSBC debit card.  There was a $14 fee from circle, an £8.86 fee from HSBC and a shitty 1.59 GBP/USD exchange rate from HSBC (market rate was 1.65 at the time I think).  In all then, $500 worth of bitcoins cost £322.37+£8.86; which is a rate of 1.50 GBP/USD, or an overhead of 10%.  Which makes 5% not seem so bad.

The other important fact about goretex, however, is that it's also durable. Spend £30 on gloves and maybe get some mostly-waterproof ones which'll do the job but won't last, or spend £80 on properly waterproof goretex and they'll last three times as long.

Dempsey wasn't deployed on the right, he shouldn't be compared to lamela. He's a withdrawn forward. Similar to Chadli, he exploits space the striker creates to pop in his goals.

Siggy should be here as cam cover, but at 25 you need to get constant playing time and he wanted to be a starter. He never should have been deployed on the left. But he isn't better than eriksen and Chadli operates better off the left than Siggy did.

But in the summer of 2013, we went way overboard. We removed the heart of the club, and replaced it with a pack of players of no balance and no appreciation for the club to rally around to make it work.

People such as you seem to be saying that accusations of rape are bad because they ruin lives, but that the guy was right to spend £200,000 on accusing the girl. 

We don't actually vastly disagree I don't think, but I'd appreciate it if you stopped painting me as a bogeyman who thinks everyone is guilty of crimes. Let me put a few things more clearly:

* No one should be assumed to have committed a crime in the absence of evidence and eventual conviction except in limited situations (e.g. Statute of limitations). 

* No one should be said to be definitely, totally innocent of an accused crime unless they can conclusively prove that they did not commit it. They should not be *assumed* to be guilty, and should not suffer negative elements from it. This is important because non conviction =/= innocence. 

* If innocence was automatically asserted from a not guilty verdict then we would have to immediately punish all accusers in those verdicts for perverting the course of justice. 

* Why do we not punish all accusers? Because mistakes are made, but also because the person may still have committed the crime even if they are not convicted of it. 

* I agree that we should have something similar to the Scottish system. 

I hope that's relatively clear. The point is that you cannot say that this guy definitely did not commit rape, and regardless I'll say it again - *it isn't important whether he committed it*. The question is whether the CPS should be carrying out a public prosecution on a case where the police has said there is no evidence.

Finally, I don't see why my second scenario is a conspiracy theory. As a lawyer, I can tell you this shit happens all the time in private law. I've both bullied and been on the receiving end of attempted bullying. It's all a big regrettable part of the game. I wouldn't be remotely surprised if it had also happened in criminal law, at least not if my friends in criminal law aren't liars. 

Edit: I forgot the most important part because it is painfully simple to a lawyer. The important thing is whether the system worked. I actually don't care if a murderer gets away with it if there is no convincing evidence that they did it. Because that is the fairest system - innocent until guilty. Thereafter, he should be left alone and not suffer repercussions unless new evidence appears. BUT, the fact that there is no evidence that the murderer did not do it does not mean that he did not do it. 

*Innocent until proven guilty does not mean that a person did not commit a crime if there is no evidence against them. It just means that they don't suffer any ill effects until there is convincing evidence showing that they did it beyond reasonable doubt.*

Given how much of a grip FIFA have globally on Football, there really is no chance of setting up a competing league without agreement from a sizeable chunk of football governming bodies and teams around the world.

I can't find the source now but essentially FIFA has the ability to control and sanction players and clubs however it see's fit. It can make it very difficult for any proffesional player for example to be able to move and play for a non-FIFA affiliated organisation.

I realize that Amy Pond gets a lot of hate. And I acknowledge that, of all the companions, she's the only one who got a voice over at the beginning of the show. So she was definitely treated differently and maybe didn't deserve all of that attention.

But she is very good in the role, and the writers really knew how to exploit her strengths to the utmost.

Another factor to consider is that a couple of episodes in, you get Rory as a full-time companion, too. And Rory is the man.

So while Tennant may be excellent, and I'm not sure the show will replace the feels you got from him, Smith's Doctor is more part of an ensemble, and the three of them really do very well together.

false,Firefox7275,null,null,"**Name of product:** Tesco Pro Formula Radiance Melting Gel Cleanser

**Price of product:** £5 for 100ml 

**Where did you purchase:** Tesco

**Product claims:** *""The Pro Formula Radiance Melting Gel Cleanser contains green tea and vitamin E  complex and effectively clears away make-up and impurities, helping the skin to  look clear and radiant.* 

*Dermatologically tested, hypoallergenic. This product has not been tested on animals, we fund research into alternatives.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased as a comparison to the NSPA gel cleansers.

**Your opinion:** The price point is reasonable considering there is little water and no mineral oil which are both super cheap ingredients. Packaging looks cheap, gel is a sludgy 'tea' colour and doesn't have much of a fragrance - very much no frills with a short ingredients list. 

The cleanser goes onto the skin as a silky rather than greasy oil, yet is far less messy that a regular cleansing oil due to the gel formulation. I haven't experienced any irritation or adverse reaction and it rinses squeaky clean with warm water so IMO is suitable for all skin types except very dry.

This is my least favourite product in the *Waterless Balms &amp; Oil Blends* category. I have given away the remainder and will not repurchase because I have been spoiled by how luxurious the NSPA and Body Shop gel cleansers are to use! However I would recommend to anyone who doesn't have access to Asda or who wants to avoid neroli oil or citrus extracts.

**Ingredients:** *""C12-15 alkyl benzoate, glycerin, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, water, sucrose laurate, sucrose palmitate, sweet almond oil, fragrance, vitamin E, green tea leaf extract, BHT.""*

Tests with universal indicator paper at pH 6/ 7, not confident this is accurate because the product contains so little water.

false,kkaam,null,null,"I think there are two separate issues here.  Firstly there is the problem that discussion of different ""levels"" of rape is very commonly linked with attempts to downplay or excuse rape, or to blame rape victims.  For example, in Roger Helmer's (the UKIP and former Tory MEP) blog post discussing the differences between ""date rape"" and ""stranger rape"", he asserts that date rape victims are partly to blame for being raped.  When Todd Akin (the US Senate candidate) made his comments about ""legitimate rape"", he was arguing that women who become pregnant as a result of rape can't have been ""legitimately"" raped and must be exaggerating.  In this article, we go immediately from ""some rapes are worse than others"" to ""this incident I read about in the papers totally wasn't rape, even though a court looked at all the evidence and concluded beyond reasonable doubt that it was"".

Secondly there is the problem that people make broad-brush assumptions that some ""kinds"" of rape are necessarily more immoral or more harmful than others.  This is really about sensitivity: nobody likes to be told that something they are struggling to cope with is easier than what other people are going through.  Even if a kind of rape is thought to be ""less bad"" in general, there are lots of factors that determine how it will affect any given victim.

* Winston Churchill was born in the 1870's. By the time India became independent he was 73 years old. His perspectives on the ""place"" of India in the Empire, and in the wider world, were shaped by the era he lived in. 

* I **don't** mean to suggest Churchill was a *product of his era* in the way we often dismiss cute racist old grannies as being a *bit behind the times*. I mean that Churchill saw the world through the eyes of Britain as a globally dominant superpower. However, after the second world war a lot of people didn't have the appetite for that sort of ambition, and not least the finances to support it. But regardless, Churchill saw India in a different sort of world to the one we live in today... a world dominated by the British Empire, the USA and Russia. I don't think he (or anyone else) could see how a country like India could slot into a globalised world - because that sort of concept of globalisation didn't really exist then. 

I think one thing Churchill did particularly dislike was Mahatma Gandhi. At one point he said *""It is alarming and nauseating to see Mr Gandhi, a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir of a type well known in the east, striding half naked up the steps of the viceregal palace, while he is still organising and conducting a campaign of civil disobedience, to parlay on equal terms with the representative of the Emperor-King.""*

Now that might make difficult reading for a lot of people, but in a sense, you have to frame what he was saying. I think the anger he felt at Ghandi was similar perhaps to how some of us felt towards Alex Salmond in the recent Independence referendum... here was this plump academically mediocre man, striding up to Westminster purporting to have all the answers, to parley on equal terms with the Prime Minister... and we all knew (and know) that he won't stop pushing until he gets what he wants.

With the introduction of a few foreign players to the first team, we were playing some of the best football to date.

I'm also not British, so this may seem xenophobic, but I remember reading something about how some newly acquired players (I want to say Paulinho but I'm not sure) didn't even know where Tottenham was on a map. To me, that speaks volumes to the fact that players are merely seeing us as a stepping-stone club who can offer an avenue to a bigger club while also paying a nice wage.

On top of all this, recognition for the importance of our club is also an added benefit. 

This of course isn't to say drop all of our foreign talent, as some clearly do care. Lamela is certainly one, and I agree he shouldn't be dropped for Townsend and especially not Lennon. In fact, I even think we should avoid Rodriguez for the sake of a more suitable foreign option.

I just don't think there is a necessary correlation between being English and being willing to give it your all for the club. Sandro was a great example of this. 

I also think that talking about ""talented international superstars who don't want to be here"" is an oversimplification that doesn't add much to the discussion. A player like Eriksen for example, we know how good he can be when he performs and how much he can add to the team. The fact that he, along with the rest of the team, have been playing wildly inconsistently this season doesn't change that, and doesn't mean that we should throw in an English player instead just because he celebrates goals with more passion. 

I'd like to add that our English players haven't performed any better or worse than the rest of the team the times we have played like dogshit this season. I agree that a lack of spirit seems to be part of the problem with the clubs performance, I just don't agree that throwing English players into the starting eleven is going to fix the problem.

Soldado hasn't ever reached either extreme and Torres had the luxury most of the time playing with a class midfield not with our underachieving lot. Put any striker who feeds on service in our team and I'd imagine they'd not do too well.

Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, there is pretty convincing evidence that suggests Torres was ruined by his knee injury.

http://www.teamtalk.com/news/2483/9090722/Torres-career-ruined-by-knee-operation

He's clearly lost his explosive pace which was a huge part of the reason why he was so dangerous. People do not turn shit overnight for no reason, there are much more logical explanations. 

Our best option is to give Soldado a run of games, maybe it won't work it, it often doesn't but we've got a very talented striker on our bench who deserves another chance under a new manager and with a new midfield.

A disabled person shouldn't have a 40% pay cut just for having an extra bedroom should they? Or should they?

Nothing to do with a working family in a shoebox ffs

As I've said, and I was hit by the cunt, the bedroom tax is ok if there's enough 1 bedroom and 2 bedroom places going free, and unemployed people get help in moving to them

Example, an unemployed couple in a 2 bed house get the chance to go in a one bedroom place 5 miles down the road 

How the fuck can they if they don't get help with removal costs?

Yes, as with all things in life, there are exceptions. But for me, I think we need to keep in things most likely to immediately improve mentality with assurance.

It seems with every new threat comes a new excuse for the government to say ""we need more power"", without ever relinquishing it. It's a force travelling in one direction.

Our slow and deliberate build up has no place for that sort of player. 

That being said, Martinez knew exactly what he was spending the money on, and now Barkley is back fit I can see Lukaku getting more joy down the middle and scoring goals. That being said, I feel that £28m for such a one dimensional player is way too much. 

---

Tough to say most improved player so early in the year, but Naismith has continued to surprise with the consistent level of his performances, and McCarthy has been the best deep midfielder in the league (along with Matic) the past few months. 

If McCarthy was at a 'big brand' club, I honestly think he would be spoken about as one of the most exciting talents in world football. His reading of the game coupled with his physicality and timing make him a scary player to come up against. 

The amount of time he is there covering Coleman, or closing down and tackling deep in the box is astonishing; and that is not to mention the number of interceptions and his ungodly ability in the air which is hardly ever spoken about... He just doesn't lose headers, even against forwards with half a foot on him.

They need to be back a bit more than they are, Gerrard needs to be a bit more forward than he is, and the CBs need to be tighter in the center, and the fullbacks have to pick and choose when to go forward better, otherwise the same problems we've been having will continue to happen.  

Again, there's a reason Rodgers made Johnson essentially a 3rd CB the other game and it was precisely this- to improve the defense.  The whole defensive system is just setup wrong, in my opinion, which is why we leak goals.

They deal a bit more with customer queries directly, there is usually the opportunity to do the CII in that role but it is not necessary to get the job.

Long story short: He's cleared of charges by the jury, but only because my dad and a few of the men in the jury had to argue the females in the jury to sense, as they were ready to hang him at the first opportunity. The facts of the case were that there was zero evidence of rape: 

- No witnesses testifying to rape, including her two roommates that were in at the time and would likely have been able to hear her
- No evidence of break and enter
- No evidence of forced penetration or bruising from a fight on either of them
- She changed her story three times, every time it had major holes

Problem is, he will forever remain the guy ""accused of rape"". While there may be nothing materially actionable as he *isn't* a rapist, future employers, friends, etc will all look at that piece of history and never see him the same again (and not for the better).

If you had a mostly Anglophone squad, training and on-the-field communication would be immediately better. 

but still...this problem would be fixed if we were better at accommodating foreign players. i'm sure we have some sort of language and cultural adjustment operation, but it took Erik Lamela a friggin' year to learn basic conversational English. (It's a hard 2nd language to learn, I know, but there HAS to be a teacher out there who can offer a good crash course.) If the Spurs board is going to revamp scouting, they should also consider how we look after our players once we buy them, since our non-Anglophone players seem to have a hard time fitting in.

I was kind of assumed by both parties going back to someones house it was more than likely game on. A number of times you just go at it and things progress and no-one said.. Wait.. 'can I give you oral' - ' can I touch you now' - It just didn't work like that in practice.. I guess consent was more 'Wait wait.. Im just going to put a jonny on' - Or her going 'Do you have a jonny'..  Once or twice (in fact once some random lady said she cannot have sex (back at her hotel) after a BJ and putting a jonny on me as she was married).. So I asked if she wanted me to stay or go.. 

I assume at this point you say if both of us were drunk/high or whatever without explicit consent it was rape? As I cannot remeber (15+ years ago) actually asking bar 'You ok with this'.. A number of times I got jumped on and shoved inside before I even got a jonny on'.. 

Real life is different to the cut and dry argument in the harsh light of day.. Thats just how it is.. Some times I was far too drunk and woke up wonder where the fuck I was looking at letters to find out the name of the girl etc..  

Anyway, you will put this down as 'showing off', its not.. its life. I am just one of many [girls and boys] that did/do this.. Its life..

The scenes were not all just here to make the plot go forth but simply to set an ambiance, and that's what I love about the  Davis part of the show. Also, by becoming the showrunner I feel like Moffat's writing lost what made his episodes so great and now the resolutions of the plots seem poorly written, being always some ""magic trick out of my hat"" thing from the Doctor (or even the ennemy just saying ""hell, I'll stop annoying you, I'm bored out of it"" &gt;&lt;)

If X happened, could your finances fix it without crippling you? If no then insure it, if yes then 'self insure' I.e make sure you keep enough funds handy to cover the scenario
E.g if I had a bike worth 10k and I wrote it off, no way could I afford to replace it so I'd get insurance (if I can't afford the insurance then I shouldn't get a bike worth so much in the first place)
If I had a bike worth say 4k that's on the borderline of affordability with my savings. If the bike was just for fun (weekend warrior) I'd probably self insure, if I mess up and can't quite afford to replace it's not the end of the world to have to save up for a few months. If I was using it as my primary means of transport then being able to replace it promptly would be essential and id insure.

My current condition has a bike worth about 3k and while it's my primary means of commuting, I do have access to a car. Right now funds are a little short so fully comp. next year it'll be worth a bit less and funds will be a bit more comfortable so I'll probably drop down to TPFT

I agree. Which is why I replied in the way I did to /u/yellowbenzene.

I made it ridiculous, to point out that it is idiotic. Something that seems to be lost on the majority here.

The point about parents not deserving space on the bus, and blaming them because it was their choice is as idiotic as any of my examples. A choice has a result, whether it's the choice to have unprotected sex or the choice to jump off a balcony.

&gt;Giving wheelchair users priority is a two pronged issue: 1, not being a vindictive sod, and 2, not having totally messed up priorities.

Once more because people still don't get it: I am arguing against forcing people to ""be nice"".

If there is a bung keeping the damp out of the bottom of the steering head, they seem to last a long time - I've had bikes past 70k without problems. If it's open at the bottom, you might need to replace the bearing at about 30-40k, and getting the bottom bearing race off is a bit sweary if you don't have an air chisel.

Other than that, things don't wear out with distance they way they used to. Suspension seems to stay serviceable and the engines don't wear out. 

Age, on the other hand, is a problem. You get corrosion, electrical problems (because of corroded terminals and wires), dulled paint and so on.

Anyways, onwards and upwards: 

As you work solely on technicalities, this is going to take ages. 

Here's an excerpt of a source which I will cite below: 

Referring to the middle east - ""Today, many maps include the countries of Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Central Asian states of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. Until the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Central Asian countries were usually studied as part of the Soviet bloc and Pakistan and Afghanistan as part of political and cultural region of South Asia, rather than as part of the Middle East.

However, particularly after the tragic events of September 11 and the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan, these countries have more often been associated with the Middle East because of their political and religious connections, although there are also many dissimilarities in politics, language and culture between these countries and the Middle East."" 

So while you're correct that it's not technically officially the Middle East, modern culture often does see it as such. 

Similarly, it's technically just Pakistan and eastwards of it that's considered Asian, but English people in common conversation generally mean Muslim when they say Asian. It's a nice PC way to say it, but everybody knows what that word means, to the extent that they will use the word Indian when referring to Indian nationality, despite 'Asian' being technically acceptable for that too.

And fine, have it your way. The Muslims who killed Rigby have absolutely nothing at all to do with the Muslims attacking soldiers in the park.  In fact, all Muslim attacks in general are completely unrelated to eachother and are very rare one-off occasions...  No one should ever correlate one Muslim attack with another Muslim attack, or point out when the perpetrators are Muslim extremists because that wouldn't be very PC.  Honestly, do you think that makes any logical sense at all?

What I did was state the obvious. It's primarily Muslim extremists that are currently attacking people like psychos, and you don't see it so much with other ethnicities, or religions, or whatever you'd like to call it. Nationality is irrelevant to religious extremists.  A Muslim extremist from Nigeria is not all that different from a Muslim extremist from Pakistan or any other place.

Not all Muslims are terrorists, but there's been like a thing with Muslim extremism lately. Sorry if that hurts the PC in you, but it's the truth and I wish people would stop denying the obvious. Defending extremists at the cost of common sense is not at all helpful.

I'm only stating the obvious: It's no surprise that they were Muslims, because there is a disproportionate amount of extremist Muslim ideology around at the moment. That is all.

Once they've decided that, then the next thing to consider is whether Evans had any reasonable belief as to her consent.  They did not believe there was, hence the conviction. 

I'm glad there is some publicity for this case. Every once in a while you get bleeding hearts on TV bleating about low conviction rates for rape. What they don't understand and are willfully blind to is the fact that rape is extremely difficult to investigate, because rape is tried on consent, for which there very rarely is a smoking gun. In this case the smoking gun for MacDonald is her willingness to go the hotel room with him and her conduct prior to going into the room. 

That MacDonald fella does not come out of this well at all frankly.

Reasons to pay off:

- peace of mind?


Reasons not to pay off:

- interest rate is at or below inflation so the loan isn't really earning interest

- Lots of people are going to have their loan written off, so no advantage in paying off money that otherwise isn't going to be charged (btw I don't feel at all guilty doing this - I work in a graduate-only job where the government sets my pay so it's kind of up to them whether I pay it off or not)

- You will usually have somewhere to put the money right now that either earns more interest (savings) or avoids interest charges (paying off a mortgage or car loan, for example)

- Even if you *don't* have anywhere to put the money right now that earns more interest, in the future you will presumably get a mortgage. If you've put money into student loans, that's money you can't put down as a deposit, or use for overpaying on the mortgage - and you won't find a mortgage with lower interest rates than a pre-2011 loan!

So far so good, but wait.. there's more..

&gt; However there is a broad sweep of exceptions including threatening, abusive or insulting words or behavior intending or likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress or cause a breach of the peace (which has been used to prohibit racist speech targeted at individuals),[120][121][122] sending another any article which is indecent or grossly offensive with an intent to cause distress or anxiety (which has been used to prohibit speech of a racist or anti-religious nature),[123][124][125] incitement,[126] incitement to racial hatred,[127] incitement to religious hatred, incitement to terrorism including encouragement of terrorism and dissemination of terrorist publications,[126][128][129] glorifying terrorism,[130][131][132] collection or possession of a document or record containing information likely to be of use to a terrorist,[133][134] treason including advocating for the abolition of the monarchy (which cannot be successfully prosecuted) or compassing or imagining the death of the monarch,[135][136][137][138][139] sedition (no longer illegal, sedition and seditious libel (as common law offences) were abolished by section 73 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (with effect on 12 January 2010)),[136] obscenity,[140] indecency including corruption of public morals and outraging public decency,[141] defamation,[142] prior restraint, restrictions on court reporting including names of victims and evidence and prejudicing or interfering with court proceedings,[143][144] prohibition of post-trial interviews with jurors,[144] scandalising the court by criticising or murmuring judges,[144][145] time, manner, and place restrictions,[146] harassment, privileged communications, trade secrets, classified material, copyright, patents, military conduct, and limitations on commercial speech such as advertising.

It does go on a bit more if you're keen. Freedom of Speech except all the things that you couldn't say before we had Freedom of Speech, essentially.

I particularly like the next line.

Not Muslims. That's what this argument is about, not PC nonsense, not the political situation in Pakistan. Simply that you called two British born Nigerians ""Asian"", which is wrong.

false,TheJoshider10,null,null,"I was not a fan of the season as a whole. It was forgettable apart from stand out moments, and it had some of the absolute worst moments in the show as well. It's a shame, since Capaldi is now my favourite Doctor overall, and since I feel he is the highest calibre of actor we've had so far, he deserves so much better storylines. 

* The moon being an egg, which then hatches, which leads to no repercussions, which then miraculously lays an egg bigger than itself in the exact same place as the original egg, is just fan-fiction and I am not regarding it as canon. To me this is just a simulation but Clara's rant at the end stays as part of the canon. Sorry, but I am not having that as canon in my show. Absolute bollocks and it's something I would expect from a fucking 10 year old on tumblr, and that isn't a joke.

* Clara practically allowing kids to die just so they ""don't feel alone"". Not even any thought about it, she would just straight up choose to have kids burn to death. Sorry but you can't do decisions like this in a 40 minute run time unless you give most of the episode the focus on her decision. Then to make matters worse they stupidly brought back that missing sister at the end of the episode. Seriously there is no point, stop writing bad fan-fiction, please.

* I was a fan of the finale overall but the one thing I absolutely hated was the way that they made Danny nothing more than a soldier. It was building up that he *was* more than a soldier and that it was something he could change about himself so what does the episode do? Butchers that completely and practically makes out that ""once a soldier always a soldier"", and this wouldn't be a problem if they didn't so blatantly make it that Danny was nothing *more* than a soldier. This isn't even fan fiction level of bad, this is just a downright disregard for any character development ever.

Just such incompetence this season as a whole with regards to characters. They turned Danny into nothing more than a soldier, and Clara nothing more than a bitch that wanted what she wanted and for some reason the Doctor always answers to her and does what she wants, which was Missy's fucking plan for crying out loud.

Capaldi and Missy were honestly the only strong points of this season. There were good moments, and the odd good episode, but overall just forgettable episodes, absolutely atrocious and a complete disregard for previous character development meant that the season overall didn't bode well with me. It had the Doctor Who feel, but it was still a bit of a sack of shit to be fair. 

I would happily have a season 9 or 10 which was something special and focused solely on 12/Missy having to join forces for whatever reason. I think it would be needed. Something special is needed. I just want to get away from the horrible single episode seasons with the same generic end of season arcs. Give us a season where there is one main story over the course of the season (not just individual adventures tied together with a lose reference for the finale) and that would be enough. Give us a Missy and Doctor focused season and that's something original all together. 

TL;DR: Two of the worst episodes of New Who mixed with terrible character development and a lack of stand out quality moments meant it was overall a very mediocre season only redeemed by the excellence of Capaldi.

It is possible to criticise religion without making sweeping generalisations, but having a relatively firm idea of the topic and making balanced arguments about how to handle x and y and to look at it as a social concept.  By saying all Muslims are paedos because Mohammed had young wives or that burqas are *only* the tool of oppression and therefore we should ban it are very ignorant comments and show little understanding and tend to express a bigoted, prejudiced view.

It is possible to criticise immigration without making sweeping generalisations, by looking deeply at the socio-economic impact, referring to the numerous facts and studies by many academic institutions and other organisations and accepting them or asking further questions about the whys and hows.  But saying that you don't want to live next door to Bulgarian's is again, ignorant and prejudiced.

It is possible to discuss race, albeit a difficult one, because generally speaking you only ever come off as racist because there is very little to pick apart other than skin tone or body build etc.  You can discuss the communities populated predominantly be certain races and ethnicities, but generally speaking, this is much more of a socio-economic topic again and less about the genes a person has.",0,1415910408,null,0,false,0,cm1o74u,t3_2m6oa5,t1_cm1o74u,t1_cm1iemr,null,1426040841,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

* First year accommodation is great! It's not on the site, but it's five minutes walk away from the city centre, at which point you're there (and you get to walk through King's to get there, which is always lovely), and very modern and spacious.

* Great academic reputation

* Very, very central, but not touristy at all. It's two minutes walk away from King's, but none of the tourists know about it so you get the place to yourself

* Absolutely gorgeous. Tree Court - the court you enter into - is unapologetically Oxbridge, with a symmetrical row of trees on either side of the main pathway. It's the fourth oldest college, and it's fairly big, but not huge or imposing at all. I would say it's the perfect size

* Stunning library (used to be the University library) and chapel

* Extremely friendly students and a lovely sense of community. Very common to hear a ""Get Caian!"" (pronounced ""Get Keen"") on a night out with friends from Caius.

He generally says it to prominent feminists to get a rise out of them. The joke is that he's such an idiot that people are laughing AT him and he doesn't actually believe this as a performer. It works on another level as we can actually see how intolerant these people who preach about 'tolerance' actually are. I love Baron Cohen and think he's brilliant at this.

Keith Lemon I think is a bit shit but at least his character is so far out there that you know as a performer he doesn't actually view these women as sex objects. He's the joke. It's still shit humour, and it definitely is sexist but it's not as bad as Dapper. At least the crowd know it's a bit tongue-in-cheek.

To stand in a room and rile the crowd up with blatantly misogynistic points and to say some woman is 'gagging for a rape' is just beyond the pail. I'm not saying that it should be banned but it really does not deserve to be defended. It works on one level and that's a bunch of morons down the pub who can't joke about anything unless it's LAD humour. The idea of Dapper as 'performer' or 'irony' in what he says is lost. They're not laughing because he's poking fun at 'lads,' they're laughing because they thing it's alpha to belittle women and treat them as objects. He admits himself that it's not even a parody, he's a just being a twat. I love comedy and he's not a comedian, he's a twat and anyone who thinks he's funny hasn't the first idea.

I'm on the fence over whether he should be banned or not. On one hand people should be allowed to say what they like but on the other hand what he says is clearly indefensible. As in, he can't even attempt to defend it himself.  

The gentrification of comedy is such a poor fucking thing.

If you've followed Spurs for awhile, you'd be aware that our medical staff has quite a questionable track record of clearing players too early only for them to get injured again or clearing them to continue playing despite a clear and dangerous head injury (Lloris). Vlad is not a member of our medical staff.

Again, Vlad, for the aforementioned reasons, is going to want to stay on and play. That is why clubs hire managers to make those tough decisions. Poch royally fucked up. He should have subbed him at halftime at the latest. We were up and had all 3 subs available, including more than enough defensive cover on the bench to easily make the changes necessary. Instead, Poch opted to leave Vlad on in a no-win situation when he was clearly struggling. Sure, he played poorly, but so would anyone playing with a broken nose especially at the highest level of football against an exceedingly physical forward like Ba. Vlad doesn't get paid to make the decisions about what subs should be made. Poch does and he fucked up.

I felt the explanation for the moon being an egg was rather weak and felt the script probably should've gotten a rewrite. Clara in general felt like a bitch towards the middle of the season (especially after Kill The Moon in my opinion with the poor writing too.) which I didn't like because I liked her in Series 7 Part 2 and it's a shame that it seems to be sounding like she might be not be in Series 9. I didn't really care for Danny's character and felt that he was written in so they could have a romance subplot which kinda sputtered and failed.

I didn't like how they wrapped up Danny's storyline too. I was expecting him to maybe become a Companion with Clara for a bit (If I'm not mistaken he was descriped as a Companion of the Companion and I expected him to wind up on the TARDIS traveling for a bit similar to Rory)

I wonder if Series 9 is going to deal with The Doctor dealing with finding Gallifrey. I do feel maybe Moffat should pass the torch and maybe with the New Doctor some fresh eyes might do wonders for the show.

I also wonder why the fuck the ending of In the Forest of the Night happened? Did we really need it? No, in truth we really didn't.

I felt both Frank Cottrell Boyce (In the Forest of the Night) and Peter Harness (Kill The Moon) didn't really know how to write Doctor Who. But I did think Jamie Mathieson did pretty decent with the episodes he wrote.

Ok fine, it's Muslims being dicks not Asians being dicks directly. You win. But you have to admit Nigerian Muslims have a lot in common with Pakistani Muslims. I didn't look at Nationality as a serious division in this particular case. It's an Asian religion they're following, so maybe it is indeed more indirectly Asian influenced.

It is an interesting notion that could play a little on how some have interpreted the various Doctor regenerations being something of an image of their emotions from the previous regeneration (We had a sort of brooding Eccleston for the post Time War, Tennent with a more trusting nature as he learned to work with Rose (especially since she was there for 2 Doctor bodies), Smith as a more easygoing though over time we see him getting a little haunted, and then Capaldi as an expression of his role in ""fixing"" the Time War).

Both the current and previous Master bodies had some sort of insanity to them. But in this case, the Master is a little more calculating and on the surface has a bit of a more nurturing which might almost be natural when comparing expectations of men and women. Plus the previous Master would have been recognized by more than just a few people to an extent so there would HAVE to be some new body. It is probably way too fanwanky, but given The End of Time the Master wanted an army of himself and for himself and then here the Master made an army for the Doctor, it might give the Master some very noble intentions. Throughout his life the Doctor has (mostly unintentionally) hurt people, usually indirectly. By having the first army, the Doctor would, in theory, not hurt more humans. And this new army could have protected anyone who would otherwise get hurt.

That is just my interpretation, of course, and you can downvote my ideas to the Satan Pit if so you wish.

The main parties are pretty much indistinguishable, but that historically has meant Labour and the Conservatives, and now's as much the case. The Lib Dem vote has collapsed because they've been ineffective as part of the coalition and lost the faith of those who genuinely believed they could make a difference- tuition fees especially will have hurt them. At the last general election, they received 23.6% of the vote. Now they're polling at 7%.

As such, UKIP have swept into the vacuum of ""protest option"" that had previously been occupied by the Lib Dems through sheer force of Nigel Farage's personality. That, in turn, has inevitably centred more of the discussion on race, immigration and religion, which has brought more extreme views at both ends to prominence.

The big problem in this is Ed Miliband. The coalition are there for the taking, but Labour have done nothing whatsoever in opposition to suggest they're a better choice.

false,madtweeter,uk,Hampshire,"I'm in complete agreement that wheelchair users trump pushchairs - also, the disabled folk trump the pregnant. In the past three years where I've been commuting via public transport, I've noticed that some (not all) mothers and mothers-to-be have a huge sense of entitlement. Parenthood is a life choice. 

This wheelchair vs pushchair issue is not limited to buses though, but to trains, too. A couple of years ago I was on a train where a mother refused to give up the priority space and was given an ultimatum to collapse her pushchair and sit with baby or get off at the next station. She gave up her seat and the whole carriage boo'd her as she effed and blinded about the entire thing.

Also, in one of the stations I travel through put announcements out that pushchairs should be collapsed prior to boarding the train. I rarely see this happen. You then watch commuters in the rush hour battle through pushchairs as they get on and off the trains. It is a nightmare and once or twice I've had a handle in my ribs.

On the (extremely rare) times I have had to travel on public transport with a small child I have made sure that I had a sling for that child (when he was small enough) or a collapsing umbrella like pushchair. If he was sleeping - tough. If he cried because I woke him up, I soon enough distracted him and he either fell asleep again or kept looking out of the window giving me a running commentary of what he could see. It's really not hard.  ",0,1415914062,null,0,false,0,cm1q8yd,t3_2m68k7,t1_cm1q8yd,t3_2m68k7,null,1426039884,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2
