There has been no evidence that Hamas was behind the killing of the 3 teens and Israel's own intelligence agencies are having doubts about their involvement as well.

- how can occupation be justified when it is the cause of all this resentment from the Palestinians.

true,LordMondando,null,null,"1. Can apply to nearly any conflict going on in the world today, of which there are dozens. 

2. Uh.. ok, that's somewhat ignoring the fact we were forced out. A lot is made of the Balfour Deceleration, but it was never offical active policy. Zionism was at best mutely supported, but it rapidly became an active, violent opponent of the British state once Britian took control of the area from the Ottomans. Interesting fact, supporting zionism **was** an official policy of the ottoman state before we took the area. 

3. No one ignores it, its the most covered and publicised conflict - probably in human history. 

4. Again, dozens of conflicts fit this. The one in CAR for example. 

&gt;Also a government is a big place with big departments and they can deal with more than one thing at once. They can be worried about Ukraine and Gaza and so should David Cameron.

I think its very naive to suggest that every possible action in government does not carry an opportunity cost.  We can't diplomatically throw ourselves into every problem going, from a pragmatic point of view the threat of Russia to the E.U is far more pressing, than getting involved in yet another flare up in the levant which will again, go fucking nowhere.

We only really opted for a 4-2-3-1 last season when the injuries to our strikers started piling up in the second half of the season.  I think Pellegrini will revert to the 4-4-2, and use Nasri-Silva to cut in and feed  the top two.  As for Dzeko over Jovetic, I think after the end of last season with Dzkeo's form, the starting berth is his to lose.  Plus, Jovetic needs to show he's willing to fight for a spot like a proper professional.  Obviously, the starter may change as the season gets into swing.  
Also, it's hard to tell who will get the nod between Kolarov and Clichy, as both have played well in preseason.  Against Arsenal, I'd say Clichy in the Community shield because of his defensive upsides, but Kolarov would be an excellent width option against a questionable Newcastle side to open the season.  
At CB, Pellegrini likes Demi too much and after such a deep and defensively sound WC run for Argentina, he'd be a good pick until Pellers feels comfortable with our younger options.  Lastly, Fernandinho may be in for a surprise bench spot if Fernando is excellent in training, especially after Brazil's utter destruction in the WC.",0,1407102571,null,0,false,0,cjfzuzo,t3_2chuo6,t1_cjfzuzo,t3_2chuo6,null,1435051300,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1

true,Omblae,UnionFlag,Yorkshire - Honda Hornet CB600F,"The hoops you have to jump through at your age are unfortunately a product of statistics. 

I've had lots of chats with my bikey friends about this exact thing and this is the problem:

1. Bikes are inherently dangerous. 
2. Bikes are cheap (relative to cars). 
3. Bikes are stupidly powerful. 

Now let's take an example, Greg, who is seventeen. Let's say Greg has ridiculously wealthy parents/inheritance from his poor Gran who left him 5K in dispensable bills. Let's also say that the graduated system for bike licences doesn't exist. 

Greg can go out and get his car licence for £400 or so, leaving him with £4.6K. He can buy a sports car (s2000, RX8 etc.) that will do 0-60 in the region of 6 seconds for about 3-4K used. However, Greg will NOT be able to insure the thing for anything less than 3-8K. So Greg has to, like all young drivers, buy a hatchback with a 1.2 litre engine.. 

But wait! Greg has a mate who has a sport bike that will cream the 1.2 he has. So instead of going for the hatchback, he decides to buy a decent used Honda Hornet/FZ6/Suzuki GSR 750 - so let's say it takes Greg £500 to get his licence. Then let's say he spends £2500 on the bike. Now let's assume he goes for TPFT insurance and gets it for £1k (expensive for a bike but considering his age it's probably about right) then spends the other 1K on gear/MOT/Tax/condoms. 

Now all of a sudden Greg owns a vehicle that will do 0-60 in anywhere from 3-3.5 seconds, pays significantly less for insurance and is free to go about his business. 

But Greg is seventeen and thus should not have access to something so powerful. In the case of cars, the prohibitive cost of insurance prevents this from happening - but in the case of bikes they are so damn cheap to insure that it doesn't. So in this case, the only way to prevent Greg from being another statistic is to stop him from having such a powerful bike through a progressive system - meaning in a couple of years after owning a smaller bike, Greg can get a medium sized bike and then on to a big bike when he's had a bit of experience. 

The truth is I think the graduated system is a good idea (as someone currently WITHIN the graduated system). However, the problem is that you are right in that it is BLOODY expensive and inconvenient to take part. Re-test every two years? The last test cost me near enough £600. So for a 17 year old we're looking at near enough two grand and four years just for an unrestricted licence! 

But the alternative is that Greg ends up dead in a ditch aged seventeen ten miles down the road from first hopping on his GSXR - as seen in many countries without a graduated system. Whilst I agree the practical side of getting your licence is a pain in the arse, you can't fault the logic in why it's there. 

What I never understood is why someone would do the A1 licence if you can ride the same bike with a CBT. Seems a bit of a waste of time to me really. ",0,1407104103,null,0,false,0,cjg0jdw,t3_2cj55h,t1_cjg0jdw,t3_2cj55h,null,1435051630,9,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,9

I guess the authorities hide behind the 'young and dumb' banner and feel they need to legislate to lower the number of motorbike fatalities. 

The comment about 19 year olds not being able to afford the test isn't specific to 19 year olds but anyone who can't afford the test probably isn't going to be able to afford the bike and insurance too. Not much to be done about that, it's a free market I guess. 

I did my full test about 3 months before the age cap came in. I thought it brought the test in line with car licencing (just a lot more bureaucracy with the bike licence). The age restriction does feel unfair as some of my friends are on restricted licences but I can see why it's needed.

As for the bike being provided by the test provider, this would substantially push up the price of the exam up and be less efficient then the instructor providing the bike. It would eliminate competition across instructors for lower pricing and better bikes. Also instructors generally do their own maintenance and try to stay competitive by keeping costs down. Test centres wouldn't do this. 

You sound frustrated by it but stick to it bud. It sounds like you are so close! You won't be thinking about all you had to do to get there when you are enjoying the twisties. Just in pure pleasure at being there.

You get things like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oesBeCFAlg) happening for instance. So do you shoot the ambulance knowing that you will be killing fighters? Or do you let it go by because you know that the weapons will be removed from the wreckage before reporters get there, and Hamas will claim that an ambulance full of civilians were butchered? 

It also makes it much harder to report the news from this. Most people will generally treat the news the hear as true, and this will be reinforced by their self imposed filter bubble. This means that managing information becomes a huge priority in a conflict, as was seen during the MH17 downing, and is really evident in the Gaza conflict. Hamas are masters of managing information to present the view that they are being slaughtered for no reason by the evil Israelis, and since this is what a lot of people want to hear it works really well.

Elevenreds was a fairly popular user on this sub for awhile. He claimed to have been a part of the youth setup awhile back whose career was ended due to injury. He ran an AMA on this sub, and it seemed that his identity had been at least partially verified. At this point, there were still some doubters about his identity, but for the most part? I think many people on this sub were excited to have someone so connected to the club. After some time, it became evident that he had found employment with the club, and would occasionally post what seemed like insight into the runnings of the club. During this time, of course people had been calling him out on being a fraud... but opinions were split. He would make posts like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/16iee1/elevenreds_here_lets_clear_some_things_up/), in which he clearly refers to his employment under the club. He'd been stirring up numerous rumours about transfer activity, and at this point, the pot was about to boil over.

Eventually, the mods banned him. The whole thing had been made up. Even if there were elements of truth to it, none of that really mattered at this point. [Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1tmdyp/elevenreds_has_been_banned/) the thread explaining the ban. He had made up his employment status, and (as it seems) forged emails from the club to make it seem as though he were employed by them. Eventually the mods received confirmation from the club that there was no one working at the club by his name, and the rest is history.

More than the ""lying on the internet"" bit, what struck me was the guy's dedication to the act. It seems like it's something he *really* wanted to be true. He strikes me as a lonely guy who found a warm community (I remember when this sub had less than 6,000 subscribers), and decided he wanted to be something more than he really was.

He is widely praised for his discipline, even those fans that don't rate him will agree. Jose made him a DM for a reason, it doesn't matter which position he played at before he came to Chelsea. That is the position he has played at in all these years and he has been a good player for us. I rather have an experienced DM on the bench than a young DM who has been on the decline. Romeu going on loan to team like Blackpool will give him more experience and he might he even come back to us as a better player.

Vertonghen

Kaboul

Chiriches

Dawson

Dier

Musacchio (not sure if you are counting him as there has been nothing official from the club ) 

Veljkovic (this would make 7, but not sure if you are counting him instead of musacchio)

Naughton

Fryers

now onto my analysis! 

i think that out of the CB's listed Dawson should be sold and Veljkovic should be loaned out, i think Dawson is a wonderful person, but without him we would still have 5 centerbacks of arguable 1st team quality that wont require a shift from the highline 

it has come to the point where dawson in the lineup has cost us points simply from his lack of pace and proper positioning in the high line

i think it is obvious that veljkovic has some qaulity about him, but i dont think he is ready for the first team and a loan spell should hopefully develop him further 

the fullbacks i think are fine the way they are and dont need any movement. we have a lot of games this season and right now we have a back up at right back (also it should be noted that he is one who is willing to play second fiddle) if walker struggles to shrug off his injury and we also have rose and davies battling it out for that LB spot that davies should have the hold on as of now. 

I think that fryers may not be first or second string in either of those fullback spots, but he is versatile and seems consistant (hey, he scored yesterday!) enough to keep around in case we get plagued by injuries in the back

I think that BAE has been great for the club, but age has gotten to him and he is no longer the player he was and for that reason i think he must be off either on loan or sold. 


all in all i think we only need to make a couple of changes and if musacchio is confirmed then we have strengthened and shaped up nicely during this transfer period!

Harborne is about 15 minutes from the city centre, and has a few good bars and pubs. The [Arco Lounge](http://www.thelounges.co.uk/arco-lounge/) is a pretty nice bistro style bar/restaurant. It's a good lunch spot, and the cocktails are alright. The [Plough](http://theploughharborne.co.uk/wp/) is the most hyped pub in Harborne. In my opinion it's pretty overrated, but most people think that the drink is good, and the food, particularly the pizza is great. 

Chinatown is unsurprisingly a great place to get Chinese food. There are tonnes of good places, but of particular note are [New Sum Ye](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186402-d1090487-Reviews-New_Sum_Ye-Birmingham_West_Midlands_England.html) (Really great food, no nonsense atmosphere, try the [three roast meats](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/apr/15/restaurant-review-new-ye-sum)), [Cafe Soya](http://www.cafesoya.co.uk/) (The most comprehensive vegetarian Chinese menu I've ever seen, there are actually two Cafe Soyas, a more casual lunch spot in the Arcadian, and a really fun restaurant/kareoke bar by the indoor market), [Red N Hot](http://www.rednhotgroup.com/) (Very serious Szechuan food, try the Ma Po Tofu), and [Shanghai Shanghai](http://www.shanghai-shanghai.co.uk/indexbrum.htm) (I've not been to this one personally, but people say it's the best place to get dim sum in the city). 

In the alternate drinking section I'd add John Bright Street, which is probably the best place in the city centre for that sort of thing. On John Bright Street there's [Brew Dog](http://www.brewdog.com/bars/birmingham) (Hip craft beer bar from the eponymous brewery, they always have something good on), [Cherry Reds](http://www.cherryreds.com/) (Really long bottled beer list, a lot of good Belgian stuff, the foods good and vegetarian friendly, too) and [Turtle Bay](http://www.turtlebay.co.uk/) (It's just opened, and looks like the goofiest chain restaurant, but the cocktails are great, and they have a ridiculous rum list).

I'd add [The Dark Horse](https://twitter.com/DarkHorseMosele) to Moseley, it used to be Mo Dough (An amazing pop-up pizza place, R.I.P), they've kept the pizza and expanded the menu and made it into a proper pub. I'd also add [Cafephilia](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Cafephilia/479464072106696) (A neat coffee shop, open only for lunch I think, but they bring in delicious food from Soul Ful Lebanese bakery, and make their own cool sandwiches on foccacia).

United are going to be deadly this year, just a feeling Van Gaal will be a Fergie type and get the best out of mediocre players.

I wouldn't be as bold as you and claim that Ukraine as a whole, meaning all of its citizens, desired this; issues like these are never black and white. Remember that the new government gained power not through democratic means, but through a coup; the people have not made this choice, a small group of influential people did. Second, how could a country gain greater independence by joining an international trade and military coalition? Both of these commitments inherently diminish a state's sovereignty. If Ukraine truly wanted greater independence, they would have adopted the Swiss or at least the Swedish model. Third, Russia has a lot of economic ties with Ukraine, and it is no secret that Ukraine owes a lot of money to Russia. It seems very suspicious that the oligarchs currently in power wish to sever ties with Russia, especially considering the fact that they would fiscally benefit from doing so. These people also had tremendous power under Yanukovich; it's ""meet the new boss, same as the old boss,"" unfortunately. Let me emphasize that these my own opinions.

The club offered him a coaching role working in the youth team at first, but this young coach worked his way up to the first team over time. This coach also enjoyed posting on reddit during his spare time, and sometimes gave people on /r/LiverpoolFC inside goss!

This coach's reddit username was /u/elevenreds and he was a well respected member of the community here. He even posted from on the bench against Spurs! Towards the end of his reddit career though the goss we got became more and more ludicrous and people began to doubt, for some reason, Elevenreds' credibility, despite the fact he had never proven who he was! /s

Eventually it all came to a head when the mods pushed him for proof of who he was and he caved, saying he had made up everything. I *think* he had been using a proxy so that he could have a UK email address, DO YOU SEE HOW HIS LIES ENVELOPED HIS LIFE

In hindsight it is painfully obvious, but a lot of people fell for it. I don't know if I did, I always doubted it but I guess I never questioned him on it either.

And I also disagree with your assessment. Perhaps if this was something that was only happening for a couple games, weeks, or a short period of time it'd make more sense. Everyone goes through slumps. But there comes a time when trends become your level. This isn't an aberration. This is the new normal. 

Also, there are conceivable arguments to be made about why this is happening with Torres. One being that he previously relied so much on his physical gifts before he was injured, and now that they're gone his average technique is being exposed. And like I said, Torres is suffering from a severe lack of confidence. It might be because of his injury and the fact that his abilities have been limited. It might be because of all the pressure that came with his big money transfer and poor results. It's probably a combination of things. It's not just that Torres doesn't have the physical ability he used to, but I believe his lack of confidence is hindering his decision-making, composure, and assuredness as well. How many times have you thought to yourself ""old Torres would've scored that""? Now he won't even dare attempt the same shots or tricks like before, let alone score from them.

Agger's transfer feels nearer and nearer each day but even if it doesn't come soon, it gives the rest of the younger CBs time to develop. Skrtel is the same age so you'd think his time might be nearing to a transfer as well, especially with some of the stats he put up in blocked shots, clearances and goals last season. He might take up Kolo's current role when Agger and Toure are gone (While Sakho and Lovren battle for Agger's spot, or play in a back three). Coates should get decent playing time this season if we don't sell him, he's looked really impressive. But if he sticks around and plays second choice to Skrtel now, he'll be playing his position in a couple of seasons easily I think. Coates can become a huge part of a back three if BR is really considering it, I wouldn't be surprised with this massive stock of central backs we have. As well as Lovren, he's 25 so we're going to be set for maybe 3-4 seasons, more if he decides Anfield is home!

Yeah, while every player of every position has lazy moments (except for Ledley, obvs), Ade's lazy moments seem to stand out whenever they happen. I love the guy and love when he works hard. It's not like a high work rate is rare from him either. He's very talented and is fantastic in hold-up play. Everyone froths over his ""heavy"" touch, but personally I don't see it. 

You're right about Soldado's potential. Most of it, however, I assume it from people wanting to ""see"" his potential to learn whether it's actually there or not. I put quotes around 'see' because I'm not convinced we have not seen his potential... as if maybe he's destined to play in La Liga to maximize his talent. Who knows!

&gt;Their religion is not relevant to it

Well, coming from someone who occasionally delves into areas of Islamic history, its not entirely accurate to say that. I'll just leave you with one example, the location of the Ka'aba. There have been numerous examples of the advancement of mathematics due to religious requirement in this area (from what I understand at least). Heres a quote and a source to further illustrate my point: 


&gt;""It is this fundamental importance within Islam of the concept of sacred direction (qibla in Arabic and all other languages of the Islamic world) in ritual, law, and religion, applying wherever the believer was, that gave rise to the charts, maps, instruments, and related cartographic methods described in this chapter. These sources clearly reflect the dual nature of science in Islam. On the one hand there was ""folk science,"" ultimately derived from the astronomical knowledge of the Arabs before Islam,  which was devoid of theory and innocent of any calculation. On the other hand there was ""mathematical science,"" derived mainly from Greek sources and involving
both theory and computation. The former was advocated by legal scholars and widely practiced over the centuries. The latter was practiced by a select few."" 

[The History of Cartography, Volume 2, Book 1: Chapter 9 - Qibla Charts, Qibla Maps, and Related Instruments - David A. King &amp; Richard P. Lorch](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/books/HOC/HOC_V2_B1/HOC_VOLUME2_Book1_chapter9.pdf) (University Of Chicago Press) 

Edit: Added the rest of the quote. Plus I haven't read the article yet, kinda just jumped to the comments, but as [Cthalpa commented](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2chwzh/islam_is_reviving_british_values_says_former/cjfncm9) it maybe misleading.

Are you sure that this, along with almost everything else Hamas do, wasn't purely for PR? Considering the sheer number of rockets that they are firing now on a daily basis. People have forgotten that there was almost two weeks of continuous rocket fire from Gaza before Israel started its ground offensive.

&gt; this conflict started when Bibi used the death of 3 Israeli teens as a pretext

I think you are showing your bias here. You're saying that the conflict started when Israel responded to the abduction and murder of three schoolboys. So were Israel just meant to ignore it?

&gt; how can occupation be justified when it is the cause of all this resentment from the Palestinians.

I mean, maybe this has some truth to it. But you're forgetting that in 2005 Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip, and rather than use this freedom productively, the Palestinians responded by firing thousands of rockets. If they truly wanted complete freedom, how did they think this would help?

This guy is around 5'11. He's 11 &amp; a bit stone. He's good with the ball at his feet. He's not great in the air - and even if he *is*, he's touching 6ft at best. Chadli is built more like a CB than this guy. Could that not sound *exactly* like a player we already have now, yet has only played a dozen plus a few games for us? Right down to the build, the exact height and weight and very nearly the age? A player we ALL agree should NOT partner Vertonghen? Yes, he looks very good in La Liga - a league where on the floor, technical football is key and Mascherano is a decent CB? Yeah, that league. A league I think Chiriches &amp; Vertonghen would excel in? So we'll have 3 of the similar, ball playing CB's and Dier as no doubt Kaboul with either be sold or play 5 games, and Dawson is Dawson.

So, that guy we're spending 15-20m on - when we've penny pinched all our signings so far (Sig = Vorm/Davies, Falque = Dier) and there's no signs we're dropping that required 15-25m on a position where we currently have a middleweight boxer stature in Chadli, Townsend who is more a RW who cuts inside on his left and Lennon, who LW = LOL. Which, for the system, requires good pressing and fluidity from the front and hence makes that LW spot very important indeed. Poch may want to go Eriksen - Holtby - Lamela, but I'm not convinced that is the case.

&gt; Russia annexes territory of a sovereign state

Crimea has been a part of Russia since Peter the Great. Russia has fought eight wars for Crimea. The vast majority of the Crimean population is Russian. In 1954 administration of the peninsula has been assigned to the Ukrainian SSR by the Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev, who was Ukrainian. After the break up of the Soviet Union, the Crimean Oblast became the [Autonomous Republic of Crimea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_Republic_of_Crimea) At the zenith of the Ukrainian crisis, when the Kiev government was *illegally* and *violently* overthrown, the prime minister of Crimea, with the support of the Crimean parliament, appealed to Russia to secure the peace and calmness in Crimea. Then Russian forces, stationed in Crimea under an acting agreement with Ukraine, established security on the peninsula. Crimea then held an internationally observed election on whether to remain an autonomous republic, or to become part of the Russian federation. The vote had a large turnout, and the overwhelming majority decided to join Russia. Annexation is defined as ""the forcible acquisition of a state's territory by another state."" Crimea was hardly the territory of the Ukrainian state, and it was hardly acquired forcibly. 

&gt; mobilizes troops on the border

Yeah, and? A sovereign country reserves the right to move its troops anywhere inside its territory. The United States has over 500 military bases *outside* of its borders and mobilizes them at will. Is it provocative that they mobilized their forces near Ukraine? Yes. But when you consider the fact that the US military mobilized their navy in the Black Sea, their airborne troops in Poland, and has been flying drones and spy planes near Russian airspace, I would consider the Russian move a prudent one. 

&gt;send mercenary thugs into the country

That is a very serious accusation, one which must be followed by evidence. “That which can be asserted without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence.” It is one thing to say something, but it is another thing to provide proof. So far, nothing conclusive has been presented to support that serious claim, aside from a few sketchy social media posts.

**I am not on either side of the issue. I am simply an educated adult who is trying the analyze the situation as objectively as possible.** A war with Russia will most certainly be an economic and information war. It is every citizen's duty to be well informed on the current issues and derive their own opinion based on the facts of the matter, and not to blindly listen to what the talking heads on television tell you. From observing the recent events, it is my opinion that the aggressors of this crisis have been the western powers, spearheaded by the US. You may have your own opinion, but I strongly urge you to forge it by analyzing facts, not opinions, by reading rhetorically the news you come across, and by not falling prey to either side's propaganda or jingoism. You may not agree with me, but please respect the fact that I have a right to my own opinion, and please at least give me some credit for being as objective and unbiased as possible.

No pics I'm afraid. It's not easy to get at. Don't cut anything!! The sinker just thumps up against the tube the cable goes into, stopping you from opening it too wide.

&gt; How did you know how much to take off for it to do just under 100?

This is a bit of a /r/CalamariRaceTeam answer, but just go 100 and remember how much throttle you're using. If you wanna get crazy, pull over and put a few bits of tape on the right of the killswitch and another on the grip where you think 100 is and see which one it matches up to. When you get home take her to bits, twist the throttle so the lines match up, hold it there and draw a mark on the cable at the top near where it goes into the tube and crimp the sinker on the line.

true,G_A,NoBike,'06 SV650s,"Seriously, don't worry about it. Restrict to 33bhp and you will be 100% fine.

No motorcycle plod would ever give you trouble for that, if they even knew that specifically it's not meant to be double the restriction. 

What they do know is that you shouldn't be riding a machine outputting more than 47bhp, and you can restrict down from 99bhp.

And consider this, a cop has to first pull you over. They have to know the laws regarding motorcycle licenses. They then have to have questioned if you're on a restricted license, and then have to question if your bike is restricted. And after all of that, they then have to impound your bike and arrange the dyno.

Don't ride like a tit and you won't be pulled over in the first place.

EDIT: Regarding restrictors for the SV, go with the ECU. They can be had on eBay and the [UK SV forums](http://forums.sv650.org) for 40-70 quid.

He looked INSANE at Steaua, and was good for us when he featured. Bar the obvious ''new league, bedding in'' and learning discipline in the system. I think he would have thrived there at Villareal exactly the same, and LW to me is a more glaringly weak position and Musaccio isn't the guy we need. We need a Ashley Williams, hell - even Curtis Davies. Matip, Laporte (pipe dream) - but you get the idea. 

There's a reason a team like Chelsea have Terry, Cahill, Ivanović, Zouma and got rid of Luiz. There's a reason Utd thrived with Vidic, City have Kompany. Look at Arsenal? 6ft 6 Mertesacker, Vermaelen great in the air. Liverpool with Skrtel, Sahko. Even Evertons best CB was Distin, who is a 6'3 6'4 who weighs over 13 and a half stone. 

That's my point. We won't have ''one and the other''.

And fair enough about me picking a bone with the original person, but they were blatantly wrong--I didn't go after his word choice. The other guy was initially trying to use Suarez's success here to justify Balotelli. That's like using Henderson's turnaround to justify holding onto Cissokho. They are apples and oranges, as they have both displayed completely different skills over their time at Liverpool. Balotelli is crazy in a different way than Suarez, and Luis's ability to contribute at Liverpool is irrelevant. This is not to mention that you wouldn't give a chance to a player who is far inferior to Suarez yet has the same baggage. I'd gladly like you to show me how I was wrong when I said ""Suarez cared about playing football and winning, above all else.

In any case, this is so tiring, and I don't think you'll even change your opinion about this, which I find hilarious given how wrong the idea that ""Suarez worked, Baloetlli would"" is. Here's what it comes down to:

Do you think Balotelli and Suarez have similar mentalities about football (what everyone would call ""attitudes"")?

Do you think Balotelli puts as much effort in on the pitch as Suarez? 

Do you think Balotelli's on-pitch contribution is good enough to excuse his locker room and off-pitch problems?

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"First, let's be clear - I don't care about how many cards he picks up.

The issue with Balotelli is he won't work hard. Rodgers wants his team to press, and effective pressing starts from the front. Balotelli's never been fond of defensive work, and that's not something Rodgers will be able to change. **That's a key difference between Balotelli and Suarez**

Similarly, Rodgers is building up an ethos - train well, work hard, and you'll get your chances on the pitch. See Flanagan, Sterling and Henderson working their way into the team. We talk about how great Rodgers is with young players - part of that is that he gives them a clear and honest pathway into the first team. We talk about how great it was that guys like Aspas seemed 100% committed in supporting the first XI while stuck on the bench last season, and that's why - because Rodgers is fair and honest with all his players. Aspas couldn't break through because Suarez &amp; Sturridge were better, but also because they both put in the effort. If a first-team player isn't following those rules, but still getting picked, that causes disharmony for the rest of the squad and discourages the young players. You can say Balotelli's changed, but the Italy squad at the latest World Cup would say otherwise. For all of Suarez's faults, he always gave 100% in training and on the pitch. **That's a key difference between Balotelli and Suarez**

Lastly, we've been after Sanchez and Remy, strikers who are also very good in wide positions. Balotelli doesn't fit that. Rodgers' ideal formation remains the 4-3-3. The diamond is a good backup, but flawed in terms of how exposed it leaves our fullbacks, making us vulnerable on the flanks. Given Mignolet isn't the best at dealing with crosses, that's an awful combination of weaknesses. Balotelli's reputation and desired wages means he would expect to start, so that would necessitate reverting to the 4-4-2 diamond.",0,1407123677,null,0,false,0,cjg92lj,t3_2ciuvi,t1_cjg92lj,t3_2ciuvi,null,1435055781,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

&gt;__William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin__ OM, GCVO, PC, PRS, PRSE (/ˈkɛlvɪn/; 26 June 1824 – 17 December 1907), was a British [mathematical physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics) and [engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer) who was born in Belfast in 1824. At the [University of Glasgow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Glasgow) he did important work in the [mathematical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) of electricity and formulation of the first and second [laws of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_thermodynamics), and did much to unify the emerging discipline of [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics) in its modern form. He worked closely with mathematics professor [Hugh Blackburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Blackburn) in his work. He also had a career as an [electric telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_telegraph) engineer and inventor, which propelled him into the public eye and ensured his wealth, fame and honour. For his work on the transatlantic telegraph project he was [knighted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Bachelor) by [Queen Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom), becoming Sir William Thomson. He had extensive maritime interests and was most noted for his work on the [mariner's compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner%27s_compass), which had previously been limited in reliability.

1. Rose is far from a defensive liability, but a young player who had a few concentration/psychological lapses which resulted in goals last season. While the season before he showed that with regular football he can be quite consistent. 
2. Rose does not in fact offer much in attack. He is miles behind Lennon in almost every facet of wing play, a player which many on the sub have criticised for not being up to our standard.
3. He is, in fact, a failed winger. A player who, deep into his youth career, was found to not be good enough in attack and was forced to move to fullback in order to continue in our academy/youth setup.
4. The ONLY reason that i could see for using Rose in that role would be if we were parking the bus against much stronger opposition away from home.

Once they achieve something it's lot harder. Sturridge came here with a bunch of honors but what he wanted most was to lead a line and he bemoaned his peripheral status in his previous squad. Balotelli is a different case, he played a major part in Serie A titles, the Coppa, and a Champion's League winning campaign. Then he came to England and won almost everything on offer here.

He's not going to be easy to change, he'll resist it simply because he's succeeded with it, there will be friction and I don't think BR winning it is as assured as you think it is. Right now the onus has to be on focus and consolidation after a good campaign we need another similar showing of both strength and intent.

Having Balotelli here will distract from both of those objectives. We could have taken a chance on him last season when we were outsiders but right now is not the time for risks like this, the worst case scenario here is not something we'd lie to happen to us right now.

true,Undeadninjas,null,null,"Speaking as someone who has not seen every episode, but has seen episodes from every doctor, I can say that each one has their own spin on it. Each is similar to the one before and after, but very different to the ones spaced beyond. Also the era they came from has a large influence as to the production of the show. The ones from the 60's are done in a very old style, and like was mentioned earlier, its very different from the new ones. 

I used to watch Doctor Who as a kid. I enjoyed it, though I had no idea what was going on. So I knew what it was when they announced the remake, and tried to watch more of it before the new series came out. Took me a while... I didn't actually start watching it until Series 6, or... season 32 if you prefer. I then went back and watched all the ones I missed. Gotta say, Didn't like the 9th doctor at first. Really didn't. Drove me away, which is probably why I didn't watch it for so long. 

My suggestion, start with the 11th doctor, Series 5. His first episode is amazing, every episode after is pretty much awesome. When you've caught up, then go back and watch the 9th and 10th, and get ready, because it's a four season mega-arc. Then, once you've seen the last episode of series 4, Then go and cherry pick episodes from the classic series. If you didn't watch it when it was on, or aren't into old style TV, it will not interest you unless you're already interested. After that, it's awesome. 

My picks from the classic are as follows:

**William Hartnell:** The Daleks (Mutants), The Romans

**Patrick Troughton:** *The War Games*

**Jon Pertwee:** Inferno, The Curse of Paledon, *The Three Doctors*, *Frontier in Space - Planet of the Daleks*, The Time Warrior, The Monster of Paledon

**Tom Baker:** Robot, *Genesis of the Daleks*, Pyramids of Mars, Seeds of Doom, The Deadly Assassin, *The Invasion of Time*, Season 16 (all of it), Espeically *Pirate Planet*, Destiny of the Daleks, *City of Death*, The Horns of Nimon (Ties in with a 6th series episode, otherwise not that great), State of Decay, Warrior's Gate, The Keeper of Traken, *Logopolis*

**Peter Davidson:** *Four to Doomsday*, Black Orchid, *Earthshock*, The Five Doctors, Resurrection of the Daleks, The Caves of Androzani

**Colin Baker:** The Two Doctors, Timelash, *Trial of a Timelord* (a season-wide arc)

**Sylvester McCoy:** Dragonfire, *Rememberance of the Daleks*, Battlefield, Ghostlight, The Curse of Fenric

    1. How do you think this season will go?

I think it will be a lot harder and we may struggle. I know it was only a friendly, but our normal starting defence looked shocking against Brentford. Not what us CPFC have come to expect in Pulis' era. I also think the lack of new players quality could expose us. Campbell I am not convinced about at Premier League level. He's been to quite a few clubs but never really achieved. After watching Hangeland for the last 2 years at Fulham (had season tickets there too) is slow and clumsy. He has height and experience and that is about it. I think teams know our strong defensive and catch you on the counter tactics, that will be better prepared for us. As long as we avoid relegation, I would take that now.


    2. Which 3 players should other fans watch out for?

Bolasie - Quick skillful but needs to add goals to his Premiership career 

Ward - My player of 2013-14. Consistent, technically brilliant and always looks comfortable no matter what position he is in or who he is up against. 

Jedinak - The captain bosses midfield. My memory of Jedinak last season was when he pummeled Giroud in a 50/50. Like Ward, he always looks comfortable on the ball. Very important to Palace.



    3. How will the team line up?

                  Speroni - (Should start until performances dictate Hennesey)

  Mariappa - Delaney - Dann - Ward

Puncheon - Jedinak - Ledley - Bolasie

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Are you sure that this, along with almost everything else Hamas do, wasn't purely for PR? Considering the sheer number of rockets that they are firing now on a daily basis. People have forgotten that there was almost two weeks of continuous rocket fire from Gaza before Israel started its ground offensive.

The rocket attacks increased after Israel's raid of West Bank. Since the ceasefire of 2012 rocket fire had dropped dramatically. It was only after the raid did Hamas renew its attacks.

&gt;I think you are showing your bias here. You're saying that the conflict started when Israel responded to the abduction and murder of three schoolboys. So were Israel just meant to ignore it?

How about investigating first. You're showing your bias by giving Israel a pass on killing 8, arresting hundreds, and invading thousands of homes. What kind of a response is that? It's a clear disregard for Palestinian life and rights. As I've said, Israeli intelligence is now having doubts that Hamas was involved at all. There have been several instances of Americans kidnapped and killed in Mexico, I don't see US raid Mexico, kill ""suspected"" Mexicans, imprison hundreds, and invade thousands of Mexican homes.

&gt;I mean, maybe this has some truth to it. But you're forgetting that in 2005 Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip, and rather than use this freedom productively, the Palestinians responded by firing thousands of rockets. If they truly wanted complete freedom, how did they think this would help?

Gaza was -- and is -- recognised as occupied by the international community. Only Israel declared it unoccupied because they withdrew military forces. However it was still in effective control of Gaza. Furthermore, Palestinians were still being occupied outside of Gaza, do the Palestinians not have the right to resist occupation? Why must the Palestinians prove to the world that they deserve the very basic right to self determination? Rocket attacks do not justify collective punishment and they certainly do not justify occupation.

&gt;Also don't forget that the Palestinian people voted in Hamas. They have to take responsibility for voting in a [racist terrorist organization](http://www.hamascharter.com/). 

Bringing up a 30 year old charter is pointless, 30 years ago Bibi said he didn't believe Palestinians should have their own state. Should Israel be collectively punished because they voted in Bibi? Or how about Zionist Revisionist ideology, the ideology of the Likud party, which claims all of Palestine as Jewish land? 

None of your arguments justify occupation. Occupation is simply unjustifiable not to mention illegal under international law which Israel is a party to.

Only reason I can think of: you need to be able to ride on motorways.  
The other two reasons seem silly with a 125 [pillion and towing? O_o]

For the graduated system: I agree that it's a good idea. However, the costs required for each test - and complete inability to progress without some form of instruction [because of the need for the bike at the tests themselves] - are excessive.  

I'd propose a variant on what we had, merged with what we've got:

The same graduations, with the same age brackets.  
But, you only *need* to take one test.  
If you take a test below the unrestricted, it will automatically be promoted to the next class after 2 years.  
However, if you meet the criteria, you could pay for the next class up to get it early.

2) Yannick Bolasie. He's got everything but the end product and he terrorises defences, putting Coleman in his back pocket in the Everton match. 

Dwight Gayle. Club record signing who had a poor start to last season when he was put on but two goals against Villa and then two against Liverpool at Selhurst look promising indeed.

true,collinsl02,null,null,"Okay, then as an educated adult from the West (UK specifically) I'll try and present our side of the issue as objectively as I know how:

&gt; In 1954 administration of the peninsula has been assigned to the Ukrainian SSR by the Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev, who was Ukrainian

But Ukraine was part of the USSR which meant it reported to the Kremlin like Poland and Eastern Germany and Uzbekistan etc. There might have been the illusion of ""home rule"" but it wasn't home rule in the democratic sense.

&gt; At the zenith of the Ukrainian crisis, when the Kiev government was illegally and violently overthrown

Like what happened in Syria and other Arabic countries recently. On none of these occasions did a ""neutral"" next-door neighbour decide to help themselves to a slice of territory.

&gt; Then Russian forces, stationed in Crimea under an acting agreement with Ukraine, established security on the peninsula. 

At the beginning of the crisis armed men in Russian uniforms but with no indications at all of their nationality turned up and started taking over. We had no idea they were Russians. The only people who knew they were Russians were the Russian government. Doesn't that sound a bit shady to you, a group of armed men without country turning up and taking over somewhere?

&gt;  Crimea then held an internationally observed election on whether to remain an autonomous republic, or to become part of the Russian federation.

This was internationally observed, yes, and significant issues were raised about how and when it was held, and who was prevented from voting by armed men showing no national identity. Most western governments believe this election was significantly compromised and is not actually indicative of the will of the people.

&gt; Crimea was hardly the territory of the Ukrainian state, and it was hardly acquired forcibly.

It had been part of Ukraine for years, so it was ""the territory of the Ukrainian state"" as defined by International Law, and it was acquired by armed men without national identity, who later turned out to be Russians. That sounds like a covert invasion and therefore forcible acquisition to me. If the armed men from Russia had not turned up, would the vote have been held? That's debatable. And what would have happened if the vote had gone against the Russians? Would the armed men have left? I somehow doubt it very much - they would have stayed on and fought when Ukraine tried to retake the area like what is happening in the East of Ukraine at the moment.  

&gt; Yeah, and? A sovereign country reserves the right to move its troops anywhere inside its territory.

It's not a legal problem, but it does seem provocative, especially under the circumstances. 

&gt; US military mobilized their navy in the Black Sea, their airborne troops in Poland, and has been flying drones and spy planes near Russian airspace, I would consider the Russian move a prudent one.

The USA is hardly likely to invade Russia over Ukraine - at most the USA was acting in defence of Ukraine which was a prudent move considering that Russia, for all intents and purposes, had sent armed spies/mercenaries into a neighbouring country and was amassing troops on the border of said neighbouring country. This could have been the precursor to a full invasion of Europe for all we knew - after all, we spent 50 years on opposing sides of a frontier at each other's throats and Putin is crazy enough to order an invasion.

&gt; That is a very serious accusation, one which must be followed by evidence

I believe your government admitted that the troops sent into the Crimea were Russians after the fact, right? That's enough evidence for me. If I recall incorrectly, then I apologise, but from what I can remember these were admitted to be Russian Troops.

&gt; it is my opinion that the aggressors of this crisis have been the western powers, spearheaded by the US

The west has not invaded a foreign country using covert or unmarked troops. The west has not been caught supplying arms to a guerilla force. The west has not shot missiles across it's borders at foreign fighter jets. Russia has. All we have done is impose economic sanctions on an aggressive nation who may or may not (no accusations here, just facts) have supplied a missile that shot down an airliner full of innocent civilians.

But I'm not so sure about all of this formation discussion. Suarez wasn't a player that really fitted into a set role.

So in a 4-3-3, Sturridge could still usually play centrally, simply because Suarez played all across the front line, and also dropped into midfield. If anything, it was 4-3-2 plus Suarez.

Clearly we now have Sturridge as our top striker, but if he gets injured what then? Lambert is no replacement, as he has zero pace.

I'm all for buying versatile players who can play all across the front three, but that's exactly what Suarez was anyway, so I don't think we ever eally played ""two strikers"" anyway.

This whole thing is absolutely insane. 3 teenagers get murdered and Israel think the appropriate response is to airstrike the fuck out of the densely populated Gaza where collateral is absolutely guaranteed. What would any civilized country do in the event of 3 teenagers being murdered? 

For example, if some guys from Croydon kidnapped and murdered 3 teenagers would airstrikes on Croydon be an appropriate response by David Cameron? Would you support that under the guise of 'anti-terrorism'? Oh, but because it's in a far away land it's completely okay?

It's fucking absurd. 

Also, as far as I know there's no proof that Hamas are using human shields. The only people making that claim are Israel and it's a shite excuse. 

If someone is using a human shield, the correct course of action is not to shoot the human shield. If some supposed 'terrorists' are hiding in a school, the death of those terrorists should not ever be a higher priority than the safety of those children. It's a complete fucking cop out, and like I said, there's zero proof that this is anything more than Israel being sloppy or at worst Israel continuing its removal of Arabs from Israel in the most grossly sadistic way ever. 

Hamas are not a big enough, nor well funded enough force to pose a significant threat to Israel. Appropriate force should be used in regards to the Hamas threat, but that's not what's being applied here.

No worries though. All initial hiccups and the players looked tired probably because they just landed a few hours before the game. Hazard's first outing was slow. He'll be back to speed in a few games.

What I'd like to see is how Jose plans to break the heavily defensive teams that we were so bad against last year. That was our weakest link. People would say the forwards, but we still managed ok. Breaking through defense was more of a problem.

The availability of test dates is just a fact of life. Like you, most people would prefer/need their tests to be on the weekend, so you need to book it well in advance. Nothing to be done about that there. There's only so many hours in the day and only so many tests can be administered.

I've not looked in detail at the Mod1/Mod2 testing system. I guess you must have the Mod1 pass certificate before you can book your Mod2 which I can see as being a pain in the bollocks but if you booked them back to back and failed your Mod1, you'll lose your money on your Mod2.

Your point about lessons I agree with less. You're not **required** to get lessons before you sit your test; any wanker can sit a DVLA test at any time, it's just advisable to get the lessons beforehand so you get an independent, trained professional to give you an objective assessment of your riding and the likelihood that you'll pass the test. Yeah, the money is a problem but if you consider everything that a riding school has to pay for (vehicles, repairs, insurance, maintenance, fuel, rent, tax, council tax, wages, utilities, accreditation, etc.) you can understand why the prices are where they are.

I'm with you on supervised riding aspect of the regulations though. It's a little rankling that any eijit can ""supervise"" a car driver if they've held a license for 3+ years but after 8+ years riding (and an inflated opinion of my ability which I'll grade as ""competent"") I wouldn't be allowed to supervise another rider if they needed to be escorted to a test centre on a bigger bike. (I agree that the riders need to be in radio contact however, that's essential so the supervised rider can take instruction from the supervisor).

But there are still ways around that on test day. For example, I could ride my bike to a test centre and my learner-friend could ride their 125 to the test centre and (assuming the insurance is in order and the bike meets the minimum requirements) the learner could undertake the test using my bike while I sit on my arse and wait for the test to finish. It's convoluted but if you have a friend willing to do that for you then it could be done and it wouldn't cost any money. At no point are either of you in contravention of the laws as they currently stand (the learner didn't need supervision while going to the test centre and they bike they needed was there for them).

Sure it can do a national one (indeed all things being equally its how you SHOULD deal with a national one). But the root of this problem globally was a global contraction of clusterfuck proportions in the availability of credit. Spending on U.K infrastructure, social services, whatever. Can't tackle that. People are really muddying the waters (often for partisan political purposes) by suggesting the two situations are equivalent. 

Hell we have a pretty good case study in 'the road not taken' France and the U.S. It's gone 'okish' for the U.S because there the fucking U.S, main driver of the world economy, confidence in them is relevant to global confidence as a major constituent - so by keeping things like their consuming spending (for example up) it does drive global confidence as a whole up and so is money well spent(ish). France... not... so much, might as well be a case study in economic anemia of a major economy, figures crossed it doesn't do a perpetual recession for 20 years now a la Japan. Fuck man the youth unemployment there is crushingly depressing.

We need to spend fucktons now on infastructure, sure. I am fully on board with that. But chipping away at our credit rating (from which said funds, **must come**), when at any moment everything we might have accomplished could simply be wiped away by another series of bullruns outside of our economic jurisdiction really makes no sense.

&gt;But Ukraine was part of the USSR which meant it reported to the Kremlin like Poland and Eastern Germany and Uzbekistan etc. There might have been the illusion of ""home rule"" but it wasn't home rule in the democratic sense.

You are indeed stating the truth, but it is irrelevant to the discussion. The point remains that a territory of high strategic and historical value for Russia was taken away without Russian consent. 

&gt;Like what happened in Syria and other Arabic countries recently. On none of these occasions did a ""neutral"" next-door neighbour decide to help themselves to a slice of territory.

It seems that you haven't been paying attention to the current events in Syria. Also, you're using the strawman fallacy; I never said Russia is neutral in this situation. It clearly isn't.

&gt;At the beginning of the crisis armed men in Russian uniforms but with no indications at all of their nationality turned up and started taking over. We had no idea they were Russians. The only people who knew they were Russians were the Russian government. Doesn't that sound a bit shady to you, a group of armed men without country turning up and taking over somewhere?

I see two fallacies here: ambiguity and a loaded question. What did they start ""taking over""? What does ""taking over"" mean in concrete terms when applied to this situation? Your latter question has an assumption built into it and cannot be answered in any way without appearing guilty.

&gt;This was internationally observed, yes, and significant issues were raised about how and when it was held, and who was prevented from voting by armed men showing no national identity. Most western governments believe this election was significantly compromised and is not actually indicative of the will of the people.

These are serious assertions, and the burden of proof lies in the accusing party to provide evidence. I recall reading about Ewald Stadler, member of the European Parliament, who said: “I haven’t seen anything even resembling pressure. People themselves want to have their say.” 

&gt;It had been part of Ukraine for years, so it was ""the territory of the Ukrainian state"" as defined by International Law, and it was acquired by armed men without national identity, who later turned out to be Russians. That sounds like a covert invasion and therefore forcible acquisition to me. If the armed men from Russia had not turned up, would the vote have been held? That's debatable. And what would have happened if the vote had gone against the Russians? Would the armed men have left? I somehow doubt it very much - they would have stayed on and fought when Ukraine tried to retake the area like what is happening in the East of Ukraine at the moment.

I see several issues in this argument. Here are the facts: Before the referendum, Crimea has formally been an autonomous republic. The prime minister of the peninsula requested Russian assistance it that time of turmoil and uncertainty. The presence of the soldiers, who's base is in Sevastopol, did not violate any agreement between Russia and Ukraine. The fact that the soldiers did not wear identifying patches broke no law, local or international. The rest of your arguments in that paragraph are built up on previous erroneous assumptions and delve into speculation, so I will ignore them. 

&gt;It's not a legal problem, but it does seem provocative, especially under the circumstances. 

Yes, it does, I believe I already mentioned that. It is provocative, but it is also a precautionary 
step.  

&gt;The USA is hardly likely to invade Russia over Ukraine - at most the USA was acting in defence of Ukraine which was a prudent move considering that Russia, for all intents and purposes, had sent armed spies/mercenaries into a neighbouring country and was amassing troops on the border of said neighbouring country. This could have been the precursor to a full invasion of Europe for all we knew - after all, we spent 50 years on opposing sides of a frontier at each other's throats and Putin is crazy enough to order an invasion.

This is a juicy one. Firstly, you cannot make such a bold claim that the US will not attack Russia solely from personal incredulity. The US has invaded other countries for worse reasons. Secondly, you cannot excuse the mobilization of US forces *outside* of its borders by claiming that it was doing so ""in defense"" of a country with which it has no defense treaty and therefore no formal reason to defend. You then go on to make assumptions based on unproven claims and invoking the slippery slope fallacy, the black-or-white fallacy, and the ad hominem fallacy. 

&gt;I believe your government admitted that the troops sent into the Crimea were Russians after the fact, right? That's enough evidence for me.

Okay, first of all, I don't live in Russia. The Russian government is not *my* government. Second, I don't recall the Russian government ever denying that those troops were Russian. This is where semantics become really important. Putin denied sending troops from Russia to Crimea, and proclaimed the troops there to be ""local militia."" If you can read rhetorically, you could see that the soldiers and sailors from Sevastopol were never mentioned, and could fit perfectly into his description. And here is your logical fallacy in applying the Crimean situation with eastern Ukraine: composition/division. You must examine these two different situations on their own merits. 

&gt;The west has not invaded a foreign country using covert or unmarked troops. The west has not been caught supplying arms to a guerilla force. The west has not shot missiles across it's borders at foreign fighter jets. Russia has. All we have done is impose economic sanctions on an aggressive nation who may or may not (no accusations here, just facts) have supplied a missile that shot down an airliner full of innocent civilians. 

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I highly recommend you read up on your history before making such erroneous claims. And yes, that whole Malaysia Airlines crash is a very sad chapter in the already sad story in Ukraine. But the whole situation seems very suspicious and raise certain questions: Why was the commercial plane directed to fly over a war zone? Why hasn't the US or Ukraine released any evidence before accusing Russia and the separatists? Why do the released Russian radar logs show two Ukrainian fighter jets within 10km of the plane before the crash?  Does the Ukrainian army have the BUK-M missile system? Is that system the only one capable of downing a plane? What would Russia or the rebels gain from shooting down a civilian airliner? Who gains the most from this publicity? Only questions, and no answers. 

I hope it was as interesting reading this correspondence for you as it was writing it for me. Alas, my friend, I found your arguments neither objective nor compelling. It would benefit you greatly if you arrive at your conclusions from hard facts, rather than the opinions of those you see and read in the media. Only time will reveal the truth.

r/MCFC is right, the best way is to subscribe to the calendar. Indeed, TV broadcast (or storm ;) can have an impact on the fixture dates and timetable

Below the webcal feed to the calendar.

webcal://www.mcfc.co.uk/Handlers/FixtureICalendar.ashx?teamid=D7D91550-F6C6-49B4-9E23-FF665C0F7AC0

On Google Calendar, just go to ""other calendars"" and then subscribe by URL (link for reference https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37100?hl=en)

Also, until we implement the broadcasters on the website and in the webcal feed, I would also recommend to bookmark http://www.livesoccertv.com/teams/england/manchester-city/ to know the channel it is broadcasted on.

Just because you are talking about the economy does not mean you are not talking politics. The economy is one of the main spheres of politics and each ideology is pretty much based on their opinion of the perfect economy. 
&gt; We need more socialism at this stage, but the tory pricks won't do that. Longterm though we need an entirely different way of structuring our economy once all the ""boring jobs"" are taken by robots. We need to focus on creativity and less on labour intensive work. We won't be able to ""make a living"" anymore, not for most people when those jobs are either automated or outsourced. None of our leaders want to even think about that right now, it's too frighteningly hard to figure out so they are hoping the next generation will do it for them. Wankers.

The Slip is definitely an iconic image of the season (not a good one for us, but still) but to call it the defining image of Liverpool's season is, at best, short-sighted and idiotic. Liverpool fell at the final hurdle, yes, but it's a hurdle Liverpool were never expected to even get to... until the image OP posted. Liverpool failing to win the title isn't as significant as Liverpool being in the title race in the final weeks, because the former was expected all along, the latter was the surprise and, arguably, the story of the PL season (United's absolute failure probably being second).

Either they don't care unless it directly affects them personally, or they get shamed into automatically disagreeing with any point raised by the rioters by the whips or the media.

Also, addressing your point, I don't think many people would equate mass destruction of property and violent attacks on police and innocent bystanders as ""looking out for each other"". 

The food banks are ""looking after each other"". Wild, destructive rampaging mobs...not so much.

I don't see this as people playing a blame game. When there's no denying that the malaise and misery felt by some sections of the population is a direct result of policies made by a certain member of Cabinet, I don't think it's too unreasonable to blame that person.

I have a theory that Cameron sat down with his cabinet when they got the Lib Dems onboard and were able to form a government and said ""Right guys, we've got five years to pay the country back for kicking Thatcher out and not electing us for 17 years, let's do as much damage as we can so Labour will look even worse when they're voted in in 2015.""

Edit: Also, the Police and Army, the ones who would be deployed to deal with the rioters, are just as much victims of austerity measures and other reasons for rioting as the ones they're trying to stop. I do have to wonder if one of the reasons nobody's rioting is the realisation that our public defenders and armed services are being as fucked over as anyone else.

Have we learned nothing from the tradegy that was Tony Blair's media driven politics?

It is through challenge that robust positions can be supported and better defined. Caving in at the first turn, just because it might be difficult is no route to better outcomes.

&gt; Ultimately, it's politically impossible for Israel to change their policy w.r.t Palestine

That's not correct and that is also Israel's excuse for plowing ahead.. maintaining that they are obliged to act. Israel, with backing from what is suggested to be the World's only superpower, is in the dominate position.. yet they abuse that, reducing Palesintians access to resources, be that land; or water; or energy; or imports; or exports. The Israeli have too many excuses and are too included to making life more difficult for those they cast as enemy, rather than meeting their obligations relative to supporting moves to a long term sustainable and peaceful interaction with their neighbours.

Acting out of 'necessity', is rarely the better path and more typically represents the selfish interests of one party rather than the better interests of all.

It's completely achievable. Israel's only real concern is it's security because the reconciliation process is going to take a very long time. The Palestinian security forces will need funding and support from the UN to stop any rogue terror attacks...people tend to get a bit more radical you see when all they've ever known is death, fear and destruction.

The common man in both states want a two state solution. The reality is that the Israeli government has an insatiable appetite for wanting more land, history quite clearly shows that. This stems from the notion of a ""chosen peoples"". Seriously have a look at members of the Israeli Knesset...just go on wiki or whatever, it's not pleasant reading. 

Israel needs to be doing much much more for the peace process, as the more powerful player, they've held all the cards for ages. Apart from actually pushing for peace though which would actually be better for them security wise in the long run, they've used negotiations as theatre to land grab. That's not my opinion by the way, that's fact...check the maps, do the reading. Netanyahu has stated he would ""stop the galloping towards the 1967 borders"" - such borders are those of a fully recognised Pal state. They're also going to have to talk to Hamas eventually, you can't blow your way to peace, it's absurd - that's assuming you believe the official line for military intervention, there's always another agenda and here it's to maintain the status quo which on the whole is working out well for Israel now. 

Hamas need to stop targeting civilians and recognise Israel on the basis of 1967 borders - believe it or not they have actually touched on this in the past, but they should formally now. I would go as far as to say they should formally renounce violence against the occupation but I don't think they should do that without some assurances of *genuine* peace talks from Israel. A tricky one. 

The political leader of Hamas was recently interviewed on Hardtalk for the BBC - it's worth watching. Check out different new channels too - some of them get Palestinian representatives on too. 

The problem with the news at the moment is it's become all about Hamas vs. Israel when really all the underlying context is being forgotten or conveniently ignored. I dare say the Israeli government are loving this because it detracts all attention away from peace talks as actual progress...should the day ever come then they're bargaining on the settler movement being so engrained
in Palestine that essentially they'll have to concede more land. Rocket attacks are a convenient distraction from the governments point of view - that's not to say it's totally unjust and obviously horrendous.

Finishing 11th last season was incredible and Pulis is a genius for managing to achieve that, but anywhere above the relegation zones will still be considered a good season IMO. We need a couple of signings especially at striker and left back, but there's plenty of time left in the window.

2. Joel Ward - In many Palace fans' view he is England's best right back, and his stats and performances last season went some way to confirming this.
Mile Jedinak - Dominating captain who played all but half an hour last season, became the first Palace player to score at a World Cup, has performed brilliantly for us for two seasons now.
Marouane Chamakh - Fan favourite due to a series of assured performances since joining from Arsenal. His link up play is probably the best I've ever seen from a Palace player.

Well, I won't argue with you here. I'd love it is politicians had policies, and they tried to convince us that they had the right policies. Instead we get this silly situation where even a Tweet is considered too long for the media to report in context, and those with vested interests will take a single comment and misrepresent it to further their own agenda.

&gt;&gt;  Ultimately, it's politically impossible for Israel to change their policy w.r.t Palestine

&gt; That's not correct and that is also Israel's excuse for plowing ahead.. maintaining that they are obliged to act. 

I do mean right now. The *correct* response would have been to have done things differently several decades ago but it's too late for that. There *is* a beginning of a solution and while it's not perfect, Israel's biggest concerns are about details that can probably be solved, but they're essentially being held hostage by the right wing.

Hamas firing missiles means that Israel is simply going to refuse to do anything except retailiate. Of course there doesn't seem to be a lot of hope of anything happening, so evidently Hamas has given up hope, but it is still not a justified response, and it does legitimise Israel responding in turn, even if we can't agree what the response should be.

Nothing is ever 100 per cent risk free, if it was we wouldn't have plastics or electricity. The way the chemical industry works is by mitigating risk as much as possible, using practices that are inherently safe even if things do go wrong (such as using this non-flammable feedstock instead of flammable feed stock or using non-toxic chemicals instead of toxic chemicals).

Shane Duffy; looked very comfortable when deputising in the first team a few years back, and has an impressive stature. However, issues with his ball-retention and technique may hamper his chances under Roberto, who has transformed Jags and Distin into passing machines during their later years.

Also, what I don't hear talked about much is that, as far as I can tell, MS is a box to box player not a true defensive midfielder.

The problems with the NHS are in newspapers every day, papers like the Guardian and the Independent, from the BMA, even on the NHS website. The Australian system is very far from perfect, it's just that something has gone wrong with the NHS which means that *at the moment* it's worse, I don't know what the solution is.

I'm not asking you to care about me, I know you don't like me, but it's your country, so I don't understand why you don't care about all this.

Well, obviously not. It's clearly an opinion, but it's one based on observing both the general public antipathy towards fracking, and also from working at DECC. The US and Australia, with their vast tracts of empty land, are a little different to the UK. It won't happen here because you can't really frack anywhere without having a population centre nearby - and people are opposed to it. It's not a vote-winner.

Yes I agree. Young players need match experience to gain resilience. Training gives them the tools to perform in matches but youngsters are more affected by the occasion, the crowd and the pressure and that's why their performance level is inconsistent.

Skills come from training though. You get 4-5 hours training every day 5 days a week, compared to 90 minutes (if you're lucky) on a Saturday afternoon.

&gt;IMO, there is no substitute for a match itself when it comes to development.

Development is all about training, not the match itself. Actually, turn of the millennia, there was a lot of debate about English players being exposed to the pressures of the PL too early.

&gt; Audrey was intrigued and joined 80,000 people who went to Cerullo’s eight-day ""crusade"" at the Earls Court exhibition centre. Having queued patiently for her chance to meet Cerullo, **Audrey took the stage telling the preacher she believed his message of healing power had cured her. Six days later she had an epileptic fit and drowned in her bath.**

&gt; The inquest into Audrey’s death heard that only 2.2mg per litre of the lifesaving drug she needed was found in her body - the dose should have been 7.2mg.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;Do you actually believe that Israel is going to stop the blockade, the ongoing bulldozing of Palestinian homes/farms/aid projects and construction of settlements if Hamas recognises their nation state?

It's one of the tentpoles in the Israeli argument for not dealing with them, and is itself stupidly one-sided; Israel isn't going anywhere, so that's an idea that was never really going to lead anywhere for Hamas. Looking at it from the other side, other countries have started recognising the need for a Palestinian state, which could be pushed....but Palestine voted in a recognised terrorist organisation that doesn't like the idea going both ways, which gives the Israeli government more leeway in how they respond. If they came to the table with real compromises, the US/ UN could put pressure on Israel to do similar, but they can't demand much when Israel can point out that they're being attacked by rockets, directly, every day, by a government that openly wants them gone. Imagine if Israel said openly that their goal was the complete removal of Palestine...or even stopped giving warnings of their attack (in the way Hamas doesn't and never has).

If there's a way out of this, it isn't by provoking the much larger player than can destroy you ten times over - which makes the 'oh the humanity' posts stick in the neck a bit; you're supposed to consider the outcome *before* you fire an arrow at the dragon, not pretend it's all the fault of the dragon once he's burning down your village. If Hamas came to the table with 'We'll recognise you, but we want some of Gaza back' (or similar), the onus is then on Israel to match the offer (and the US can encourage them), because they then become the party holding up progress - but as long as they don't/ won't, the situation we're in now is not much different to the Israel/ Palestine 'war' a few years back; nothing has changed, so what did they really think provocation would achieve?",0,1407161095,null,0,1407163748,0,cjgj723,t3_2cihyb,t1_cjgj723,t1_cjgiok8,null,1435060950,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

You guys can downvote me all you want, but I found several comments like this, all with many upvotes.

First
&gt; What nobody realises is that David Moyes is actually a decent manager and that the United team was just too old to repeat the miracle of 12/13. They need a few more than 6 or 7 players to challenge for the title: a whole new defence and some depth in every position that isn't GK or #10.

This one
&gt; Moyes is the manager who got Everton to finish above us with a club revenue around the level of a relegation battler. Two years running.

Another one

true,chamber37,,Joe le Tactics,"&gt; Actually, turn of the millennia, there was a lot of debate about English players being exposed to the pressures of the PL too early.

That's more to do with the level of the match, not the fact that it's a match, though. You said it yourself, ""the pressures of the PL"" ... not ""the pressures of a competitive professional match"". Think about it. Why else would players get sent out on loan so much? If putting them into too many matches too soon was the problem, loans wouldn't happen, since the entire point of a loan spell is to get them playing matches surely? If not, then wouldn't they be better served by staying with the parent club and training with better players?

Don't get me wrong, I get where you're coming from (I think), but I still stand by my initial reply. A bad game always teaches more than a dominant win, and match experience is the element of a player's development that ties together everything you go over in training sessions. I can't find a source right now but I read somewhere that at Ajax, they do a lot of small-sided games in training, and encourage the players to play street football when they're not in training. It's all about encouraging a certain way of thinking, instead of them falling back on to the regimented structure of training drills. Players *need* this, because the coach's impact is extremely limited during a match. They need to be able to do everything they do in training, but when it matters, and without the coach's help. That's why match experience is so important.

Side note: No idea who is downvoting you or why. You're making valid points, I just disagree with you (and not even entirely).

Unfortunately any large scale financial collapse rapidly destroys supply chains and trading confidence, which likely leads to fairly rapid famine(or worse) in large urban areas in developed nations.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I find it strange but for once in my life a comment on an internet article actually made sense. One of my immediate family also works with the CPS and showed me the statistics on Male DV and has pretty thoroughly schooled me when I used to argue the ""equal rights/reverse sexism"" thing on the practical ramifications in terms of harm reduction and frequency of the event. 



&gt; The quest for equal rights sometimes gets itself into stupid situations and this is one of them. In 30yrs service with the police I attended many incidents of domestic violence. I don't recall being called to a single episode of a woman attacking a man. I have no doubt it happens but I think it is probably minuscule in comparison to what women have to endure.

&gt;Its is ridiculous that a women's refuge should be required to accept men. These women do not want to be near any men for a very long time after being subjected to mindless violence.

&gt;I joined in 1978. Then we were still in the dark ages and the police did not really believe their job was any more than to separate the parties. I saw that misguided attitude change over the years due to public pressure and the excellent work carried out at these refuges. By the time I left, we had positive arrest policies against all attackers, we prosecuted even when the victims pleaded with us not to. The CPS also played ball.

&gt;I fear the cuts in police budgets and everywhere else are about to reverse all that hard work. It really must not be allowed to happen. Contact your MP, contact your councillor. Do not allow these premises to close. God forbid you or your daughter needs this service one day and its not there for you or them. Having delivered a number of women to such refuges over the years and having arrested and prosecuted their attackers many many times I know what I am talking about.


Tl:DR the lack of male refuges is not a consequence of the number of female refuges and shouldnt be used as justficiation for shutting them down. Which seems fair enough to me if im honest.

2. Our logo's a cock standing on top of a ball. Took me a while to jump to this, but is there anything more fucking masculine?

3. 'The Game is about Glory': That's my life motto; life is just a damn game and you better make sure you give credence to your name. You either climb up the human ladder or as Leonardo Di Caprio puts it in The Wolf of Wall Street 'get the f*ck out of here and get a job at McDonald's because that's where you f*cking belong...'

4. we've got a damn good history that any team would be lucky to have. 

5. Everyone in Pakistan supports Arsenal. Even when studying abroad Gooners are everywhere around me. Fuck them; they're stupid bags of limp bellends.

6. Hotspur: 'a rash, impetuous person.' Yep, we got that in our name. Fucking trophy for the coolest name ever. 

7. Eriksen, Lamela, Lloris, Holtby, Soldado uhh, just bring on this season. I'm stoked, i'm pumped, i'm a Yid.

true,Thyrotoxic,cnty-wales,Not actually Welsh,"Why are you talking about the US? They have far less regulations and have very few restrictions on what chemicals can be used. 

If fracking companies are allowed to use more dangerous chemicals by the EA then you might have a point. But the EA have to agree to it and won't if there's the potential for contamination. The current chemicals in use are not toxic. You can (and do) drink the same stuff that's in fracking fluid. 

At the moment fracking companies in the UK can use HCl, polyacyralmide and a biocide. HCl is not toxic and is heavily diluted, polyacrylamide is non-toxic and used in agriculture and water treatement. Whilst the biocide in question (Glutaraldehyde) is toxic it would be used in such small quantities it'd be no threat, also it's not actually been used yet. I'd be more worried about the use of it in notoriously leaky industrial cooling loops than fracking. 

Fracking companies in the UK cannot use any other chemicals without the EA agreeing to it. So whatever's happened in the US (who do not have anywhere near the same industrial safety standards as the UK, see Texas City Explosion, the recent fertilizer plant explosion etc.) is not relevant when those chemicals cannot be used in the UK. 

I know you're taking the piss when you say fracking in the UK will be healthier because of better regulation but it's true. Regulation in the US when it comes to the chemical industry is, at times, scarily deficient. From what I've seen so far the UK government has done a good job on listening to professional bodies when it comes to on-shore fracking regulations. Many aspects of fracking are already covered by existing regulations (Oil and Gas, waste water, atmospheric emissions) and fracking itself already has a strong body of regulations thanks to its use in the North Sea. 

As far as air pollution goes it can be a problem. There are three options when dealing with methane that is drawn up the well with the return of the fracking fluid, you can vent it to atmosphere as methane which is what the article you linked to is talking about, you can flare it (essentially burn it and release CO2 and water vapour, reducing the global warming potential and health effects) or capture it and sell it alongside methane in the post-fracked well. 

Air pollution issues are already dealt with by various regulations and authorities. DECA, the HSE, the EA and local authorities all have regulations that control emissions and, in the case of the local authority, noise pollution (flaring gas is really loud). I'm almost positive that large amounts of methane released on a regular basis would not be legal adn the gas would need to be flared at least. 

Whether we capture the gas or not is up to the fracking companies as the government have not legislated for mandatory capture.",0,1407166172,null,0,false,0,cjglixx,t3_2ckuv6,t1_cjglixx,t1_cjgk67n,null,1435062097,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,john_locke1689,,Belfast. Mayonnaise.,"Londonderry Air, is a nice tune, traditional and of Ulster origin perfectly good stand in for the time being. There are a few galring issues there are no words.

The only form of nationalism any country should happily engage in is their national anthem, the whole were the best carry on isn't helpful for internal politics and is desperate if it ever is used externally all sorts of bad things happen.

However I'm willing to forgo this in a national anthem, which should be mildly nationalistic, unashamedly patriotic, and a good blood stirring anthem, something that would slightly intimidate opposing football teams, evokes desire to improve and gives insights into our national focus points.

Of course there are a few pitfalls with a national anthem, should it be treated with the utmost reverence? This could be a waist of a good rousing tune. To much reverence could have us talking ourselves too seriously.

The PUL community has a slight advantage here as for nearly 100 years the CNR community has denied that Northern Ireland should exist let alone write songs in praise of it.

**So the question is what themes do we want to convey in our national anthem?**

I am rather found of the song **Armagh Brigade**, sacrifice, desire to build something better, can be quite rousing and a little bit of history.  There are some issues with this however some people may not like some of the references to: UVF(1912), Carson, war, violence, religion, gun smuggling. Not to mention the line '*Ulster is my heritage, and Ulster is my cause, I laugh at her futility her glory is a fraud*' is not really very  nationalistic, but with the state of the executive somewhat apt. Also slightly derogatory nature in which England is referred to doesn't set forth for good relations.

**Kilaloo** nobody knows the words, but is used as the regimental march for the RIR. We don't need words if everyone joins in the 'yeoo!' (I've noticed a decline in yeos over the years and would be in favour of national service if it results in a greater volume of cheering.)

**Lilli bolero** traditional Irish tune, quick march or the Royal Electrical and Mechanical engineers, used regularly on radio 4, actual words about the glorious revolution which would please some but no doubt annoy others.

I suggest we commission a **new tune**, that incorporates a lot of the cultural aspects of Northern Ireland, a tune which should include, pipes, fifes, flute and brass, if you need to sit down to play your instruments we don't want you, a tune that *can be played by a marching band, symbolising that Northern Ireland is moving, if not forward at least moving*. A tune that *includes Lambeg drums so we can be assured that when it is played live by an orchestra there are at least two Ulstermen there.* Good strong pipe band style snare drumming high tension drums back sticking the lot. Something uniform so there isn't the weird disjointed mess that sometimes happens with the American anthem. The words are still up for discussion.",1,1407166284,null,0,false,0,cjglkvp,t3_2ckpe7,t1_cjglkvp,t3_2ckpe7,null,1435062139,0,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,0

Essentially % change in GDP is a useful measure primarily for looking at trends within your own economy and is not a useful tool for doing direct comparison with other countries but that's how this measure is being used in the press.

I don't know how much ''not'' having a water carrier, e.g Paulinho, Dembele will matter in this system as long as the two strong CM's (Capoue/Schneiderlin) aren't isolated.

What exactly you buy depends on what you want exposure to and how much risk you want to take. My own portfolio is a very risky one (relying heavily on derivatives). Depending on how much you are saving, look at buying 5-10 funds (uncorrelated as possible) to diversify.

If you prefer to manage the indices being tracked, rather than using LifeStrategy, you might consider some of the following popular ETFs:

I think we'll probably see both Townsend and Holtby before the end of the game and probably Adebayor as well.

He'll be trying not to lose the first game so I expect a lot of security at the back. I think he'll evolve from there:

Dawson/Veljkovic to Vertonghen/Musacchio
Capoue/Sandro to who knows (depends who is left and who plays well)
Townsend will probably be in a straight fight with Lennon
Chadli and Holtby will be battling Eriksen and Lamela.
Soldado vs Ade vs Kane + AN Other (not yet signed)

First of all, David Luiz is 6'2'' and 13 stone.  He wasn't sold because he's too small *or* because he's comfortable with the ball.  He was sold because PSG offered silly money and he's a hugely inconsistent defender.  That last component is not something bred into all ball-playing CBs.

Second, you highlight Chelsea's back line, but there's more at work there than the talents of their defenders (although those are significant).  Mourinho plays defensive football.  He likes strong, physical players in every position, and he's willing to sacrifice some technical quality to get there (although Chelsea's financial muscle means he doesn't always have to).  Does the fact that he sold Juan Mata mean we should get rid of Eriksen?  Poch's system is not similar to Mourinho's and is much more likely to prioritize comfort on the ball and direct distribution, both of which are strengths of Mateo's.  If you can find those qualities in a 6'4'' 15-stone defender who was available to Spurs, great, but I think that's a tricky proposition.

Which is no more invalid a datapoint than comparing different historical case studies of the same country together. Is it a perfect 1:1 experiemental enviroment, nope. But I never claimed it to be. Such a thing does not exist in economics, there are allways extrenous variables. 

&gt;Monetary policy and the Eurozone crisis are probably responsible for much of France's poor performance,

I gave a pretty good model as to why fiscal policy was relevant, just going 'nuh uh, its all montary' is not much of a counter argument. 

In fact, given the euro is generally lower (though not as much as the deutchmark) than the franc was/would be and France is a export heavy country. It's not simple a case of 'the weak euro is automatic malaise'.

&gt;How come you are forgetting Mikel is one of the main reason we won the UCL few years ago.

What? He was part of the team yes, but even Bosingwa was a part of the team. Paulo Ferreira was a part of the team. That doesn't mean I'm going call either of them solid players. They are above average players on their best day, but it is consistency that matters, which Mikel lacks severely, just like the other two.

&gt; Jose made him a DM for a reason, it doesn't matter which position he played at before he came to Chelsea.

Yes, the reasons were that 1. there was no room for him in central midfield, and we did not play with an CAM at the time. 2 Maka needed to be replaced. 3. He wanted his very own Pirlo. At the end of the day, it was not because Jose thought Mikel possessed incredible defensive ability.. It was because Jose thought Mikel possessed incredible composure when on the ball, and he wanted someone to slow the play down.

&gt;  it doesn't matter which position he played at before he came to Chelsea

What do you mean it does not matter. He came runner up in Golden Boy behind Messi before moving to us playing as an attacking midfielder. It absolutely fucking matters. Can you imagine someone like Reus being converted into a DM? That's exactly what happened with Mikel.

&gt;  I rather have an experienced DM on the bench than a young DM who has been on the decline. Romeu going on loan to team like Blackpool will give him more experience and he might he even come back to us as a better player. We need to win trophies this season and that means we have to stick with our most experienced players. Having Mikel on the bench is much better than having Romeu on the bench.

He may be experienced, but it doesn't count for much. The difference in their ability really isn't significant. Neither of them is going to be first choice, and as a back-up player I would much rather have a young player with potential than an average experienced player.

In comparing USA and France one needs to recognize that one of those countries has the ability to create its own money and one is stuck with a currency that is having major problems. France may well have been able to do what the USA did if it had a national currency.

The UK (similar to the USA) created around £375billion of money through QE, this may well have increased confidence in the UK however I argue it was a grave mistake not to inject this into the ""real"" economy but instead inject it into the financial economy. So simplistically we had a Keynesian stimulus approach for the financial sector and not the real economy and then had cuts to the real economy (the USA had much less cuts hence it is doing better). 

I agree with [Lord Turner and others] (  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/10464141/There-is-talk-of-revolution-in-the-air.html) when they argue
&gt;we need to go to the next stage of QE. Rather than relying on more bond purchases, the stimulus could be injected into the veins of the economy, or into the “income stream” in the words of the late Milton Friedman.
“We can spend it on roads, railways, smart electricity grids, or anything we want,” said Lord Turner, ex-chief of the Financial Services Authority. “Or we can cut taxes, targeting employers’ national insurance so that it creates jobs here and does not leak out.”

[The £375billion would have been far more effective in the real economy](http://www.positivemoney.org/2014/06/waste-375-billion-failure-quantitative-easing-video/), our credit rating would not have been effected more than it is now and the economy would be much healthier. A Keynesian stimulus with the new money.

A Keynesian stimulus approach can work on a global scale if the USA and China are following it. China is following it and the USA used QE monetary stimulus which could have been directed into the real economy as I argue. 

What is absolute economic nonsense (as explained in the video) and has never worked in the history of modern economics is to cut during a recession. This increases the recession length as we have been experiencing in the UK and described by the thread article.

So we could have had a Keynesian stimulus with the money we created, but I believe the ideology of this government is one of small government so they saw an opportunity to cut public services under the guise of cutting the debt (which has increased since they have been in power).

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"For me, it boils down to this. I should stop using height/weight as a thing, but it's *still* kinda relevant. 

Every (most), whatever, successful CB partnership usually has a big guy, the stopper, the ''do not fuck with him'' defender. That's just the way of the EPL. Vidic/Ferdinand. Look at why a man mountain like Distin was Evertons best CB, or why Skrtel was 'Pools best CB - statistically, and better than Agger. City with Kompany, Arsenal with their two, one which is 6ft 6 and one is GREAT in the air. You get the idea - that is *no* coincidence. 

Now, La Liga is different. It's more technical, and size doesn't necessarily mean you'll be a better CB there. Hell, 5'8 Mashcherno is forced there for Barca. But we're not Barca. Also, Barca haven't been ''the same'' since they lost the beast, all action Puyol and he kept Pique/Masherano in line. We have nobody to do that now. There's no reason why Chiriches wouldn't excel there, and he was linked to La Liga - the same league Musacchio has excelled. But we've all decided Vlad can't partner Jan - maybe against park the bus teams where our backline can push right up. 

So now we have Vertonghen, Chiriches...Musacchio. We've all agreed Chiriches and Vertonghen won't work. Everyone has said ''Chiriches is too lightweight'' and that is a bad partnership. So why will 15-20m Musacchio work? Chiriches is no worse than Musacchio (on a average over 90 minutes stats comparison) and no weaker than him - they're the same build. So now why is 17m on a defender like that perfectly fine, when we're gonna lose our 2 BIG typical imposing CB's (kaboul/dawson) with Dier as the only big guy who isn't ready yet. While lacking a LW. 

That's my point. Kinda skatterbrained reply, but I hope you get where I'm coming from. Yes, Poch may want to play some Barca-esque from the back style with technical CBs' - but it's the EPL. We can't impose our game on every single team in the league. We always need that ''dont fuck about man mountain CB'' for those route one games. 

My final point. If we sign him, and we sign a CM and LW. Fine. If this is literally our only ''big, all out signing'' - I think it's the wrong one. ",0,1407169901,null,0,1407170434,0,cjgnenw,t3_2ciwop,t1_cjgnenw,t1_cjgn1h3,null,1435062947,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

There's a large grey area where we must decide whether the landowner has placed a restriction on who can access the land. A toll seems like a pretty clear example of a restriction, though I don't plan to actually go and do some uninsured driving on the road to test the theory.

If charging for access doesn't stop a private toll road from being a highway where insurance is required, then Silverstone must also be a highway since it's accessible to the general public if they pay the fee for a track day.

The confidence with Chiriches is stats wise (from Chiriches in the EPL games he featured in) the average 90 minutes stats puts him very close to Musacchio.

There's not one stat that makes me think ''fuck, okay - buy now'' that can't be explained by the difference in the league/team or how bedded in each player is.

Hmm...yes. If for argument sake Chiriches would never hit Musas ability I would be more comfortable. But, I only viewed Chiriches as a perfect 2nd option to Vertonghen - that's the thing.

First, a shameless plug for our show Mafia on Prozac at Surgeon's Hall v53. Fun late night comedy about 2 mafia hitmen who begin having a mid-life crisis as a man (in a sack) begs them to end his life.

For reviews, in order of preference:
Trainspotting -- brilliant immersive theatre piece by In Your Face, you're promenaded through a giant room while the action unfolds around you. Very interactive, physical, bold storytelling with a kick ass ensemble.

Paradise Lost - one man production with a lot of charm and heart, he makes the Milton text very relatable and has enough theatricality (media, puppets, voice synth) to tickle the mind. Saw a preview with a few tech glitches, but probably fixed by now. Great balance of humanity within inhuman beings.

The Lieutenant of Inishmore: another IYF theatre production, this one is a blast. Strapped in a small room (25 audience along the walls), wrapped in ponchos and trash bags to protect your clothing from all the blood splatter, you don't get a second off as an audience member. The way McDonagh should be played. Performances are a bit Uneven, but Padraic and the Sister are brilliant and you can't help but have fun and engage viscerally.

Hamlet (C-venue): advertised as a high concept piece, but it really isn't. Production succeeds in it's minimalism and moments with conceptual choices (1960s rock and roll) that work (I enjoy this take on R&amp;G even if it makes no sense), but it gets bogged down in bad verse work and heavy emotionalization of the story. Not a bad Hamlet by any means, and an impressive 90 minute cut, but purists like me will ultimately leave disappointed by fairly weak acting and a watered down story.

The Church of Zirconium: didn't realize it was a young acting school company when I went in, so my immediate reaction (terrible through and through) should be tempered when realizing these young folk have seeds of talent in them. Hard to tell when the script has no subtleties and the story stays flatly in the same place. Cheers to the group for a first fringe piece, I hope they stick with it and find better material.

&gt;The __Gas Attack at Hulluch__ was an engagement in [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I) from 27–29 April 1916, between divisions of the [II Bavarian Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II_Royal_Bavarian_Corps) and divisions of the British [I Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Corps_(United_Kingdom\)). Just before dawn on 27 April the [16th Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_(Irish\)_Division) and part of the [15th Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15th_(Scottish\)_Infantry_Division) were subjected to a German [cloud gas attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_weapons_in_World_War_I), near the German-held village of [Hulluch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulluch), a mile north of [Loos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loos-en-Gohelle). The gas cloud and artillery bombardment were followed by raiding parties, which made temporary lodgements in the British lines. Two days later another gas attack was launched, which blew back over the German lines and caused a large number of German casualties, which were increased by British troops firing at German soldiers as they fled in the open. The German gas was a mixture of [chlorine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine) and [Phosgene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosgene), which was of sufficient concentration to penetrate the British [PH gas helmets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH_helmet). The 16th Division was unjustly blamed for poor gas discipline and it was put out that the gas helmets of the division were of inferior manufacture, to allay doubts as to the effectiveness of the helmet. Production of the [Small Box Respirator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M2_gas_mask), which had worked well during the attack, was accelerated.

Lucas at his best was a very good destroyer, but we don't play a system that specialises like that anymore. A specialist tackler is too much of a luxury in a fluid pressing midfield 3 - even Gerrard only just manages to justify his place with his set-pieces and distribution. The deepest player in our midfield 3 doesn't really play as a DM, he's a controller - he fits in between the split CBs, covering the area between them and aiding both passing from the back and counter-attacking distribution. Allen, Can and Henderson can all do that to an extent but Lucas doesn't have the consistent passing range or positional discipline to do it. In another system (such as Napoli's) with the opportunity to regain his form of 2 years ago, he could still excel but he's always going to be the wrong kind of player for a system like ours. I still like the guy but everyone involved would be better off if he moved on and we picked up another midfielder - I think we need another midfielder anyway because I wouldn't rely on him.",0,1407171427,null,0,false,0,cjgo87j,t3_2cll81,t1_cjgo87j,t1_cjgn8vq,null,1435063331,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

In my mind, there's a lot of value in having Lucas. We simply cannot be tied down by the idea that if we are getting a midfielder, this is the only type of midfielder that matches our style. We have a particular way of playing sure, but we also change a fair bit depending on the match, whilst being coherent with our style. Just because Lucas plays, doesn't mean we stop playing the way we play. That was quite apparent last season.

true,molierecoder777,lfcflame,,"I think there's a good argument for Sturridge relishing the challenge and pressure of being alone up top. We basically played the diamond last year to utilize the Suarez's talents and form the magic that was SAS. A lot of the frustration last season came from them butting heads and him not being the main man. Studge always said he wasn't given the chance to lead the line at Chelsea and City and had thanked Brendan time and time again for giving him that faith. He definitely is selfish at times but this season we'll want him to be somewhat selfish unless there is a clearly better option. Don't forget he was still competing with Suarez last season to be the top scorer 

(My favorite example to point to is Studge's goal at stoke late in the season. Up by 1 goal, could use the cushion, and he misses the first chance and it just barely stays in. Suarez made up the ground and was open for service but Studge didn't even look up he took it off his head, took another touch and put it right in the bottom corner for 5-3. He was selfish but he produced.)

As per your point, I defo agree that we need another CF but I think that Brendan is looking for someone who won't upset the balance and togetherness of the squad. He's always looking for personality and in this case it seems clear he's looking for width; someone in that 'wide striker' role that will be comfortable letting Studge lead the line and still have the quality to score goals (i.e. Sanchez, Remy). The CF Brendan wants may just not be available ATM and I, for one, would rather have the forward that BR wants then to to splurge for a name (i.e. your point on Carroll).

I'm not entirely sure

&gt;One in three offenders put before the courts, including sex offenders, drug dealers and violent thugs, have at least 15 previous crimes to their name, figures revealed.

&gt;A total of 327,919 offenders were sentenced last year for offences so serious they were mainly dealt with in the crown courts.

&gt;Of those, 31 per cent – or 102,000 – had 15 or more previous convictions or cautions to their name.  

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9287772/Serious-repeat-offenders-at-record-high.html

Most offences are committed by the same offenders. If you work for the police you'd see the same names coming up time and time again, and yet every time they go before a court they get ""let off"" with a pathetic punshiment 

&gt;A burglar who has been spared a mandatory three-year jail term tried to break into a house just weeks after being given the chance. 

http://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/archive/2014/07/08/11323767.Bassett_burglar_attempted_a_break_in_just_weeks_after_being_spared_jail/

And similar: https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=burglar+spared+jail

Why? Because we don't seem to actually want to punish people but we also don't seem to want to change them either.

Police probably have enough powers, it's just when someone is caught *something* should be done to stop that person offending and no one knows what to do. So we just end up in the same old situation where you could leave an area for a few years, return and the same old names are popping up all over again.

true,Makramira,null,null,"From my point of view Doctor Who is a lot about showing that ordinary persons can (and here usually will) turn out completely extraordinary when put in extraordinary situations. 

Travel with the Doctor brings ""the best"" out in his companions. I am tempted to say that it does not change them - it shows that what we initially perceive as ordinary is actually truly extraordinary. One might even say that Doctor Who is trying to tell as that a truly ordinary person does not exist. 

The episode ""Rose"" in part feels a bit strange and mundane because Rose (and even more so Jackie and Mickey) is portrayed as very ordinary initally. And we then proceed to discover that every one of them (even Jackie) turns out to be amazing.
In New Who, Martha is companions who is most competent already when she meets the Doctor for the first time. 
Donna, Amy (especially as a girl), Rory, Clara (definitely in her ""real"" incarnation) seem to me normal people in the beginning.

And I see this in classic who as well although there are more extraordinary companions mixed in as well.

Ian and Barabara are ordinary people at first as well. Jamie is (and in a way stays more true to himself than most of the other companions), Tegan (she even continues to think that she does not want to travel with the Doctor for a surprisingly long time), Sarah Jane (admittdly she starts out as courageous and inquisitiveas well), Harry, Brigadier Leftbridge-Steward, Benton (I consider the UNIT crew around the 3rd Doctor as companions as well),  Yates, Jo Grant (for her the development is particularly stunning),  Turlough, ... (I will stop now).

In New Who there are a few companions who are extraordinary and unusual from the start. Jack (coming from the future) and River (ok ""from the start"" is not well-defined for her)... and this is basically it.
  
In Classic Who there are more, e.g. Romana, Zoey, K9, Adric, ... (I stop here as well), but even for most of them there travelling with the Doctor allows them to shine even more. ",0,1407176124,null,0,false,0,cjgqsyg,t3_2clbeq,t1_cjgqsyg,t3_2clbeq,null,1435064619,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

First of all, being tall and slow and sloppy with the ball does not make you  strong or aerially superior or whatever. It makes you a liability. Dawson and Kaboul couldn't use their size to keep suarez from shrugging them both off like schoolgirls and blasting it into our goal. A good defender doesn't need size, he needs technique. Remember that goal hummels scored on hugo a few weeks ago? Hummels didnt even jump. He used positioning and technique to shrug varane off and loft it into the goal from ground level. We need our two best CB's on at all times. If that is vertonghen and mustacchio then so be it. If it is dawson and kaboul, so be it. If it is dier and chiriches, so be it. Our two best defenders will prevent the most goals. We dont need to give our oafish backups a handicap to find value in them. If they dont cut it then they dont cut it.

When I did my CBT there was one man who was rather shouty, but he was just a bit of a loud/rough man, he knew his stuff and could adapt to each person to teach them well, was just as good as the other instructors, just different kind of person. But that's the only bad thing I could tell you about my CBT, the rest of it was spot on looking back at it.

When I booked mine I requested a geared bike as that's what I was going to ride, I'd already practiced gear changes on mine going up and down the side of my house and they were aware I knew how to do it. But during the day they saw me struggling, saw me have a couple of wobblies and then at one point drop the bike. They commended me for at least trying to save it and lay it down gently, but said I should probably do the rest on a scooter. They were 100% right too. It wasn't that I couldn't do it, it was that they knew I was okay with gears on their own, but throwing in bike control and situational awareness was a bit of an overload. Removing the gears let me get used to everything first, then when the day was over and they gave me my certificate they had me do a couple of exercises from the start of the day again but on a geared 125. No problems (besides a stall). They said it sometimes happens and that because my dad's a biker if I was unsure on it I should get him to take me to a car park and run through it with me, but I was no less capable by the end of the day than anyone else. It was mostly just a matter of practice and confidence.

Sometimes they know what'll be best, one of the people I did it with had to come back for another day but they didn't charge for it. They saw it as a failure on their part. Their job was to get you roadworthy and they weren't satisfied they'd done that so come back tomorrow and they'll keep going.

Bullying and harassment in the workplace are *not* acceptable and it is your company's responsibility to make sure that you aren't being discriminated against because of your nationality. If your manager doesn't do anything and the bullying continues, you should take it to HR. 

In the mean time, I would definitely keep looking at other jobs.

With the economic climate what it is at the moment, it isn't unusual for people to be job-hopping and any future employers will probably just assume you were temping.

Sturridge is super fast, but he's not in this game for the physical duels. Lambert is good at knocking people around, but he's not really got much pace. Bony has good pace and eats CBs for breakfast. He's also very technically gifted and can finish with every part of his body.


I really like these stats as well:




* Suarez' last full season with Ajax: 2009–10 	33 played	35 scored
* Suarez' first full PL season with us: 2011–12 	31 played	11 scored



* Bony's last full season with Vitesse: 2012–13 	30 played	31 scored
* Bony's first full season with Swansea: 2013–14 	34 played	16 scored




I'm salivating at the thought of what Bony can do with supply from Henderson, Gerrard, Coutinho, Sterling, Markovic, Lovren, Sakho, Moreno ... sorry, my fingers need a rest.

Potential aside, he has only 6 senior appearances, 46 Atletico B appearances.

The only other ""notable"" (sadly) thing is his injury.  

Why are we all getting wet out of bounds for a 20 year old?

Needless to say, I trust Brendan and the team, but as supporters, shouldn't we be expecting this signing to not make ripples for the upcoming season?

In my eyes, he'd be behind Johnson and Flanno.  But I've been wrong before...so, I'd be ready to eat my shoe.
