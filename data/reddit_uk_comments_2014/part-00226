If we look at another example, a 18yr old is put in prison for burning down someone's house. This follows years of the victim being targeted because they are viewed as the local weirdo and are the subject of a variety of one sided family feuds. No one died, but it forced the victim to move to the far end of the country and change their name. After 5 years the 18yr old is now a 23yr old who has seen the error of his ways and has truly reformed.  Should the prison service put more weight on the fact that the arsonist is a reformed character who has genuine remorse for what he did?

Also, in Australia, unlike the UK you don't have to choose between ""public"" and ""private"", they are integrated, if you can't afford private your private doctor (as all GPs are) can refer you to get treated publicly, or you can just turn up at a hospital and get a referral into the public system if it's bad, though obviously that's not usually appropriate, but it is at least possible for people who are desperate.

true,johnmedgla,null,null,"Let's consider that for whatever reason, Britain breaks apart, and amidst the chaos a little village in Devon was invaded by mad Romans who scattered to the wind two thousand years ago but suddenly returned with a vengeance and set up a state stretching from Cornwall to Kent. The UN steps in with a plan to split the land.

You're quite right, we would probably fight them rather than agreeing to any partition. In fact, we could probably round up an overwhelming mob of angry people from all across the British Isles and the rest of Europe to drive them out. Of course, we're mirroring history here, so we lose. Badly. Our angry mob which outnumbered the Romans and marched with the stated intention to ""drive them into the sea"" was crushed, utterly, so perhaps we should have taken the UN partition plan before the war started, but hey - hindsight.

In any event, our grand European coalition is soundly defeated, the Romans are busy building farms and cities all over the land they just won, and our people are now jammed into what amounts to two reservations in Birmingham and Plymouth, but - and this is important - one run and indeed owned by Scotland (which swallowed up Northumbria and the Midlands in the chaos), the other by Wales.

What's our next move? Our initial understandable reaction to the Roman invasion was to reject the UN partition utterly and fight for the whole thing, but now we lost. Are we going to attempt to negotiate to get something like the original UN partition plan? 

Of course not, that wouldn't be fair, pragmatism be damned. We're going to spend the next twenty years sending raiding parties against the Romans and establishing a militarised state-within-a-state in Wales in which we try to collect our own taxes, run our own mini army and set up our own 'law-enforcement' system completely separate from the Welsh state. This will alarm the Welsh, as you might expect. Moreover, we're launching raids from Wales and Scotland against the Romans, and when they retaliate we run away and leave the Scottish and Welsh armies to fight the battles. They *really* don't like this, and start protesting.

But it's okay, after twenty years of *categorically and absolutely* refusing any sort of diplomatic engagement with the Romans, we will finally convince the Old Gang to get back together for ""Operation Drive The Romans Into The Sea, Round II, Electric Boogaloo."" At first, the overwhelming alliance we're able to put together will score major advances against the Romans and people will start talking about the Final and Utter Destruction of Rome and the Romans, but by the third day our ""Just all attack them from every direction at once"" war plan will start to be countered as the Romans engage the (separately operating) national armies one by one and destroy them in detail.

By the fourth day, our armies will be in full retreat and the Romans will occupy the reservations in which our people live. By the fifth day, they've captured significant parts of Wales, all of the Midlands and Northumbria, and random other places (such as Normandy and let's say Cork) from our Grand Alliance.

On the Sixth day, the Roman artillery comes in range of Edinburgh, Cardiff and Dublin (all within hours of one another), and our coalition surrenders. Worse, they've actually *captured more land*.

We are not happy about this, as you might expect - and we *definitely* still aren't talking to the Romans - but neither are our allies. We spend three years binding our wounds, and then decide to try something new. Remember the militia we formed in Wales? We decide the best plan is to use that force to attempt to take over Wales entirely - after all, we have nothing else to lose, right?

Long story short - we lose. We get kicked out of Wales, so the population of our reservations increase by a full 50%, Wales itself refuses to talk to us any more, the Scots are looking at us funny, and the rest of our allies are starting to get pretty tired of our shit. Oh, the rest of the world is also distinctly unimpressed since immediately after trying and failing to take over Wales we decided what would *really* help our cause was blowing random things up around the world, hijacking lots of aeroplanes,  and murdering the Roman team at the Olympics. 

But wait - there's more. While the transfer of refugees from Wales to our occupied territory was huge, *even more of them* decided to set up shop in Ireland to continue the struggle in a new theatre. It's going to take them some time to get set up though, so forget them for now.

It is a *bad time.* The Romans are stronger than ever, our old Allies are a lot less friendly since our misadventure in Wales, and conditions in our reservations haven't materially improved in almost thirty years because we *explicitly and categorically refuse to talk to the Romans* - the land is OURS dammit, and that principle is more important than any other consideration. Meanwhile, the Romans have started building whole new towns on land they captured *on our side of the UN Partition plan.* Despite the fact we rejected that plan utterly (remember, that's how the actual war started), which we remind the world daily, we still insist that the Romans building on *our* side of those borders which we'll never recognise is an intolerable provocation. Also a war crime! Of course, in order to actually leverage that, we have to notionally accept those borders after all, hmm, that requires further consideration, so let's put it on the back burner for now.

Of course, our old Allies may not like *us* any more but they still don't like the Romans, who have captured land from each of them. So, it's time for the gang to get together for one last hurrah - ""Operation Drive The Romans Into The Sea, Round III, The Final Solution"". We'll coordinate more closely this time, and launch a surprise attack on the holiest day of their calendar.

Guess what happened next? I know, I know, I hate to repeat myself. The Romans swatted us. Again. Oy with the suffering of our people. This time, our allies actually talk to the Romans afterwards, and get pretty much all their territory back in exchange for peace agreements, and agriculturally worthless inhospitable tracts on the borders which act as a defensive bulwark against future aggression. If it isn't bad enough that our former friends have effectively abandoned us with this peace, there's one more stipulation that *really* sticks in the craw. Wales and Scotland get back essentially everything, except the reservations our people live in *which they specifically insist they do not under any circumstances want back.* 

Abandoned, bereft, now with *really nothing to lose,* we're going to try (at last) to talk to the Romans. Amazingly, they aren't particularly happy to hear from us, but then we remember we forgot to tell our militia to stop raiding their towns. Worryingly, a significant number of those militias tell us where to shove it when we ask them to stop for a while so we can have proper negotiations, apparently they've lost faith in our ability to lead our people either to peace or to victory.

Everything is falling apart at the seams now, so it's time for our final gambit. The militia that went to Ireland after being expelled from Wales? They're going to try and take over Ireland now - at last, a home for our people! Apparently, we don't do irony, but I digress. We lose. Again. Even more people are expelled from Ireland and come streaming into our creaking reservations.

Okay. Now we really *do* have nothing left to lose. The Romans refuse to talk to us unless we can get our various militias to stop attacking them (and latterly sending suicide bombers), and our militias refuse to stop firing **at all**. We may have oversold the 'Drive the Romans Into The Sea' propaganda - despite having it run on our official TV channel for the last thirty years alongside programs exhorting our children to believe murdering Romans is the most noble thing they can aspire to, surely everyone understands that was just rhetoric and hyperbole - just the way the game is played? You mean a significant number of people actually swallowed it whole and are now essentially fanatics? Well fuck.

This brings us almost up to the present day. The more extreme militias keep fighting the good fight, launching futile attacks at the Romans with raids and rockets. This earns them prestige, since at least they're *doing something.* The Romans have a wacky system of government in which the leaders cannot simply ignore these attacks or the population will depose them, so they periodically retaliate. Unfortunately the geography and demographics of the land mean lots of innocent people die when they do so, but this doesn't dissuade *either side.*

The Romans refuse to have good faith negotiations with us *about anything*, be it easing their blockade of our reservations so we can bring in more supplies (or weapons, as they fear), dismantling their illegal settlements, or a fully comprehensive peace plan - unless we can stop our crazies attacking them.

The crazies, in turn, either refuse to stop attacking the Romans until they do everything we want, or refuse to stop attacking them outright as a matter of principle. Worse, the crazies are gaining influence year on year as our people's faith in our own leadership continues to decline.

So we're stuck. They won't stop doing the things we don't like until we stop doing the things they don't like. The only real change in a generation has been their unilateral disengagement from Plymouth a decade ago, but the crazies moved in within a week to take advantage of the better launch sites for their rockets. This has discouraged the Romans from making further concessions or first moves.

Periodically, we get together for talks, and multiple times in the last twenty years we've come *this* close to a workable solution, but every time we try our crazies intensify their attacks (NO SURRENDER!), and the Roman crazies (they have lots too, after fighting for this long) are able to whip up enough hysteria that the whole thing breaks down.

&gt;

&gt;Northern Ireland has not had its own unique, government-sanctioned flag since the [Northern Ireland parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Northern_Ireland) and government were [prorogued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_session#Procedure_in_Commonwealth_realms) in 1972, and abolished in 1973.  During official events, the British government uses the [Union Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Flag), which is the [official flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom) of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and is the only flag used by the government in [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland). 

&gt;The [Saint Patrick's Saltire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick%27s_Saltire) is sometimes used by the government to represent Northern Ireland alongside the other countries of the United Kingdom, and is the centrepiece of the badge of the [Police Service of Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Service_of_Northern_Ireland).

&gt;The [Ulster Banner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Banner) remains in use by [unionists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_unionism), a number of sporting organisations in Northern Ireland and some local government authorities under Unionist control.

&gt;Nottingham Forest Statement #nffc


&gt;Nottingham Forest chairman and owner Fawaz Al Hasawi has issued the following statement.

&gt;I would love nothing more than to hold on to our best young players. I gave both Karl Darlow and Jamaal Lascelles lengthy new contracts in August 2013 and March 2014 respectively, as well as investing in the futures of Jamie Paterson, Ben Osborn and Dimitar Evtimov.

&gt;I have demonstrated my keenness for the club to produce more players of Karl and Jamaal’s quality more than ever this summer, investing heavily in the facilities and supporting Stuart in his desire to integrate our youth set-up with the first team’s.

&gt;The manager and I openly discussed the proposed sale of Karl and Jamaal and he was aware of the negotiations throughout. The business side of football is changing and the requirement to increase revenue means, unfortunately, difficult decisions have to be made. As Stuart mentioned in his media interview, I have always backed him financially and that will continue. I respect him greatly and I strongly believe together we can achieve our aims and bring success back to this great club.

&gt;Should the pair’s proposed move to Newcastle be completed as expected, the transfer fees will significantly help us meet the stringent financial fair play (FFP) criteria, all the while allowing us to retain two high-quality players for the 2014-15 season, paying nothing towards their wages.

&gt;Sadly for me, there is no room for sentimentality in the running of a football club and it is up to me to start making some tough decisions to preserve the long-term sustainability of Nottingham Forest.

&gt;But while balancing the books is a hugely significant part of my role, it remains my job to ensure the manager has the best possible squad to work with as we pursue a place in the Premier League. Rest assured, therefore, that more additions will be made and the squad will be trimmed further to ensure we have a balanced and talented group of players in place.

&gt;I would also like to address two other points of interest, the first of which concerns the future of Henri Lansbury.

&gt;Clearly he is a talented player who we don’t want to lose. He rejected my offer of a new contract earlier this year but that deal remains on the table. He has two more years to run on his current contract and we hope he will play a huge part for us this season. It is now time for Henri to make his decision.

&gt;Finally, there has been much speculation over the potential renaming of The City Ground in line with a new sponsorship deal.

&gt;I respect the club, fans and stadium too much to make drastic changes to the name of the ground. However, should an offer which, again, would help me meet financial fair play (FFP) criteria arise, I would be open to making a slight change to the stadium name. I know many of you understand and support my point of view on this but I am keen to put my stance on the subject in writing.

&gt;I will continue to back Stuart with the finance he requires to build a team capable of success.

&gt;Come on you Reds.

true,NapoleonHeckYes,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"I'm sorry that we can't create YOUR perfect Britain, but the country cannot be all things to all people. 

You are purposefully ignoring all of the massive improvements we have made to our country, just for you to push your idea. 

Did you forget that, in the time since WWI, we... 

created the NHS to provide universal healthcare coverage to EVERYONE for FREE

dismantled the Empire to allow the countries to rule themselves

introduced a national minimum wage

granted women suffrage

legalised homosexuality

introduced anti-discrimination laws

pioneered in broadcasting to create the world's biggest broadcaster, the BBC

invented, or contributed significantly to the invention of television, radio, RADAR, the world wide web and high-powered computing

brought forward the world's understanding of DNA, stem cells, and even the Big Bang

And SO much more, alongside participating in the most peaceful time in our history, in terms of both decreased number of wars and those killed in our wars, AND with violent crimes at their lowest levels in history. 

Britain is not perfect, and it constantly requires good people to keep it going. And YES we dislike the bankers and want tougher action. YES we want to lift our values, in the media, as we have done and continue to strive toward (take the recent Leveson Inquiry). YES we want to improve help for the poorest and most vulnerable. And, YES, we want to watch the government like a hawk and defend ourselves against laws which infringe our privacy. 

But Britain is NOT the current government in charge.

How dare you have the gaul to say that our soldiers died for nothing. They died for our country, whether the war was just or fair or otherwise, and look how we have, as a nation, continued to repay that debt in whatever large or small ways we have been able to over the past century. 

I'm not a fan of glorifying war, nor leveraging the remembrance of the soldiers for nationalistic means.

Regarding the debate about prices and loyalty points, as I already said I don't work for ticketing so I was not in the room when decisions have been made.
However regarding the reality check, I can assure you one thing: Manchester City takes very seriously the fans and loyalty. Loyalty points are something sacred there, and I would be very surprise if International allocations was a way to get away from the loyalty point criteria. I mean if all you have to do to have tickets is changing your address, I think it would be a little bit too easy for people to cheat the system no?

Fawaz should not for a second think he will get Forest fans to side with him over a club legend who was audibly fucked off and shocked when discussing the situation last night.

* FFP doesn't just come out of nowhere like the bookkeeping Batman, has he been lying about the financial state of the club and his ability to support it for more than 24hrs? Maybe months or since the start? I'd say yes given the actions he's taken. Another black mark.

* If you were clearly so incapable of spending, don't swan around on social media and local news promising fans the earth. £500m new sponsorship deal? Could have bought Real Madrid? Can't help a Championship club without selling two highly sought after and by all accounts loyal players for the price of two thirds of one? Being keen to produce players of Darlow and Lascelles' standards is worthless when they're sold for less than it cost to produce them.

No it's not that at all. I think the political classes can throw soldiers into all sorts of shit in order pursue political gains for the sake of ego and/or greed. I think it's important to remember that we don't always go to war for the right reasons. I think an unwavering belief that we are always fighting on the side of liberty does a great disservice to the sacrifices that our military personnel make. Sometimes they're forced into shitty missions for more sinister reasons, regardless of their personal motives. If we overlook that fact, and press ahead with the philosophy that all of our soldiers died fighting for the right reasons, for liberty etc, as it does appear that we tend to do, then I feel we're never going to learn the lessons of war that remembrance is meant to teach us.

I don't see what's leftist about that. I think a certain amount of shame should be attached to remembrance, shame that we sent so many young men to their deaths, who pledged allegiance to the crown and in turn were thrown to the wolves.

I can't help but feel that the political classes that treat our military like this are only too pleased for the military to be canonised, as it can mean that whatever their goals, they know the public will be happy to send them into war, because OUR military is always fighting on the side of liberty.

His record in Germany is phenomenal. Injury and age are the worries with him. He is 31 next week and only played 21 games last year (scoring 16!). 

But as a cheapish signing on a 3 year deal I would go for him. He won't be playing every game but you know your getting a proven finisher for relatively little expense.

There's income tax and national insurance - a massive burden in of itself. Then the fees - and how about the tax on travel (fuel duties, train fares - rotten services with no compensation when things consistently go wrong).

 In any club he has been in he has never scored more than a few goals a few matches in a row and never been a typical goal scorer. Not even a typical assist player either.  

7-8 goals per season in Norway is half of what a decent player should get, albeit we haven't had a 20 goals striker in Norway since early 2000 or late 1990's. Those opening too strong are sold to bigger leagues (only to disappear there). 

The only exception to the rule is an Icelandic player with the surname Kjartanson who right now has 19 goals in 18 games, which is definitely a rare sight.

I accept that there's a substantial cost to setting a precedent that the rich can bribe their way out of jail which is more valuable than sending any individual rich guy to jail, but even so there's a theoretical number of nurses' salaries or teaching assistants that the state could train that would get me to overlook even that.

I think £60m is pathetically low considering what they could have squeezed out of him, but I actually don't object to the principle of the rich buying justice as long as we're clear that what they're buying isn't 'innocence' but a sufficient number of nurses and teachers to counteract the damage caused by their crime, plus enough of a punishment to avoid setting an attractive precedent.

He doesnt offer better movement or link up play than Ade. That is utterly laughable. Against all of the big sides last season we were playing with ten men - hes easy for centrebacks to deal with. Compare the amount of touches Ade has per game to what Soldado has per game. Soldado is only intermittently effective while Ade is a massive handful for defenders therefore creating space for other attackers. Soldado cant hold the ball up - Ade can. Ade also has a much higher pass completion rate - 83.1% compared to 76.3%. He also averages more KP's per game. Soldado is a less serviceable player than Ade - every ball has to be to feet.

If you believe that Soldado should be there over Ade next season then well, you arent watching closely enough to put it mildly..",1,1407264322,null,0,false,0,cjhrkoq,t3_2cpbww,t1_cjhrkoq,t1_cjhqvxi,null,1435459711,0,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,0

true,Melberger,1972crest,,"Thanks again for the response.

I can't agree. City make all the right noises about valuing the fans and their loyalty, and the importance of the loyalty point scheme. But all their actions suggest otherwise.

A few years ago they introduced a new, and entirely nonsensical, grading of seasoncards which meant you could double your points reward on every ticket merely by paying an extra £50 for your seasoncard. Effectively buying 'loyalty' points.

That was the first real example of the club undermining the system.

Also, for at least two years now City have been selling corporate style ticket packages for the biggest games of the season, including away fixtures with a limited allocation, for anyone regardless of loyalty points.

That means ordinary fans have to worry about qualifying for a ticket legitimately via their loyalty points for Barcelona away (like I did, but qualified in the end) at the Camp Nou, or the derby at Old Trafford, while a good several hundred tickets are taken out of that limited allocation for corporate style packages to be sold to anyone with the money to pay for it.

Is that fair?

It has only become club policy in recent seasons.

The new Cityzens scheme is just another example. £35 effectively just for the right to buy a ticket? Ticket allocations free of loyalty point criteria for new members abroad?

I don't think that it'd be easy to cheat that system either, how could a supporter register as a fan abroad and have his membership delivered to him in the UK? And it's besides the point really, the system undermines the whole purpose of the loyalty point system, as is becoming increasingly common. Even renaming it to 'ticket' points and removing the word 'loyalty' in of itself is particularly damning in this respect.

Besides that ticket prices are increasing year on year. My season ticket has seen 10% increases every season for at least 6 years. I now pay £780, which includes the 'platinum' £50 add on.

Our individual ticket prices are now among the most expensive in the league also. £50+ is fairly average for an adult ticket in a league fixture now.

And this is in a working class city, with a primarily working class fanbase.

Central London prices in the heart of the North West.

It's a point of major disillusionment for me and many other supporters. We're delighted that City are a top side now, but at what cost?

Does the club need to price out the core support, the fans that made this club what it is, the fans that made this club an attractive prospective investment to ADUG in the first place?

We really fear that City are beginning to sell out. Adopting the United model of exploiting the supporters' loyalty.

It doesn't matter how successful City become, if our match going supporters continue to exploited and priced out, then City as we knew it will be gone forever.

No amount of success will ever compensate for that.

Please share this sentiment among the other club staff, it's important that the club knows that disquiet is growing on this issue. The only reason it doesn't get raised more vociferously is many blues are concerned about coming across as ungrateful given the amount of investment we've benefitted from courtesy of ADUG. We'll always be eternally grateful for that investment, it's given me and many other blues things we could've only dreamt of not so long ago. But at the same time, promises were made to us that we wouldn't be forgotten on the clubs road to the elite.

Promises have been broken. And the disillusionment is growing. ",0,1407265455,null,0,1407265730,0,cjhs6yl,t3_2cmtpu,t1_cjhs6yl,t1_cjhopxf,null,1435084552,0,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,0

Are you a party-goer or are you looking to chill out and settle down? Are you hunting for a specific kind of job or career or are you just happy to work wherever pays the bills?

I had a quick glance at your profile (sorry if that's a bit creepy) to try and get an idea, but I couldn't glean too much - mostly I get the vibe that you're unhappy in Quebec, feel like the rest of Canada hasn't got much to offer or won't be welcoming (or much better than where you are now) and I suppose you're after a clean break?

Liverpool certainly has its appeal. I was in a very similar position to yourself nearly 10 years ago, I was born and raised in Northern Ireland and got fed up with the politics, so I moved to Liverpool for University. That was 2005. I made some great friends and although a year ago I moved to a nearby town for work (called Warrington, it's right slap bang between Liverpool and Manchester...and is exactly what you'd expect from that), I still regularly and often travel back to Liverpool to see friends.

People are quite welcoming here. At the risk of upsetting those who live in Liverpool and were born here, it also has a bit of a reputation as well. Some areas in Liverpool are, shall we say, places you generally wouldn't want to go near if you didn't need to. I've lived in some of them. There's a lot of poor people living there, crime can be high but at the same time there are some truly great places as well. 

There's no real way to know for sure if Liverpool has what you're looking for, it's one of those things you'll either love or hate.

Many pundits put him in the teams of the season based on stats. While stat's aren't the be all and end all, [he's a fantastic player to watch.](http://youtu.be/er-GdWLW5F4?t=37s)

*In a statistic sheet released by Opta earlier this month; Out of Brazil's main attacking midfield options (Firmino, Neymar, Coutinho, Oscar, Lucas Moura &amp; Willian) Firmino is higher than all of those players in Goals/Assists, Dribbles per Game, Clear Cut Chances Created per Game and his WhoScored rating is also higher than all of those names suggested.* (this was before the WC, but he maintained this level. at 22)

In 33 games he has 16 goals and 11 assists, 9 Man of the Matches from the AMC position. But that isn't the interesting part. He also is VERY strong defensively, the WhoScored profile even lists his ''Defensive Contribution'' as Very High - which for a AMC is a pretty rare quality to have. Especially in a system like Poch favours winning the ball high up the field - this kid Averages 2.5 tackles per game. To put that in perspective, Capoue is 2.1, Eriksen 1 and Holtby 1.5 per game. And I think Holtby should be our main AMC, so I'm not dissing Lewis there. He also has 4.5 successful dribbles per game (Robben has 3, Reus 2.7) only slightly less Key Passes per game than Eriksen and can play AML, AMC and AMR. 

That's why I think he'd be a great buy. Especially as the German League I feel is pretty similar in terms of quality and style to England - and he's playing for a team that finished 9th, so is ''attainable''.

They're not next level players - they're good squad players, but they're not starters and I would sell them for a good price and bring some of the Youth through as rotation. I would keep Townsend purely because he's a solid academy product - but I don't see he him ever amounting to more than that. He's not a kid now - he's quick, 2 footed and has good technique but he literally lacks the key things you either ''do naturally'' or you don't ever learn, if that makes sense. He literally hasn't contributed anything, has he? Apart from that one ''goal''. 

Chadli you basically summed up. Again, he's decent - but he's not next level. I know you need depth, but if a good enough offer came in for him to put towards an upgrade I'm not gonna shake my fist at that. Like for me, [Firmino is who I want](http://www.whoscored.com/Players/96182/). Plays for Hoffenheim, who finished 9th. I sum up exactly why I want him in [this post here, it's worth a read if anything](http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/2cp9ml/greg_stobart_tottenham_ready_to_wait_for/cjht5mr). He's basically in most pundits Bundesliga team of the year, at 22 for a team that finished 9th. 33 apps, 16 goals, 11 assists from AMC. Can play across the front, Very High defensive contribution (*PERFECT for Poch's system), and stats released by Opta before the WC showed he had more Goals/Assists, Dribbles per Game, Clear Cut Chances Created per Game than Neymar, Oscar, Coutinho, Willian. And also Reus, Robben at that stage too - I think he finished better than them at Dribbles &amp; a couple other aspects. At 22, and he maintained that level. While putting in 2.5 tackles per game - Capoue is at 2.1, Eriksen 1, Holtby 1.5 - for reference. That's the player we need, and the German league is similar in terms of quality and style to ours (this is of course subjective).

This is the worst bit. Two key players first out of the door instead of the emergency option.

true,LFCfanatic999,lfc99,,"I want to say I agree, but part of me thinks not when I play Devil's Advocate. 

I know its been well discussed before, but Barca is looking around to replace Valdes who says he's leaving and before his last year is up. Pepe, being part of the Barca setup before, looks to be a prime candidate and probably sounded out. He acknowledges that he's up for the move. Brendan gets wind and doesn't want to be the last guy without a partner at the dance decides to be proactive and gets Mignolet for a healthy fee and immediate declares him numero uno.

Valdes decides he wants to love Barca till the end of his contract, Reina tries to back track and say that he wants to stay and sign a new contract, Rodgers cockblocks him and says he's still going with Mignolet. Reina totally fucked but Rafa gives him an out with the season loan. LFC still pays 60% of his wages with Pepe showing how pissed off he is from being scorned with the full page letter.

You already know this, but just typed it out while remember in my head what went down in my view. I'm sure most of us don't know the full scope of the events of this summer, but I reckon its a possibility that Reina knew that there wouldn't be too many suitors for his services with the wages he's willing to accept and probably discussed Brendan about coming back and to compete for the spot. Brendan, still riled, stood his ground and said that he'll still be backup in the event that he stays. Pepe pissed then asks to have the contract cancelled. My theory, anyway.

To be fair, LFC did play like shit in the 12-13 season and everyone's moral was super low. I don't think it was necessarily Pepe being fired too early, it was Pepe not covering his ass enough during the whole process.

true,tree_bear,lfc99,,"A lot of the reason why downing played so much in his last season was because that might have been our worst squad in the past 20 years depth-wise. We had Jonjo playing the false 9 against Young Boys earlier in the season and the only way Downing could break into the squad later was at left back.

Most of my issue with Downing was his invisibility. You at least *knew* that Poulsen or Konchesky were playing but sometimes you could forget Downing even existed. Plus you have to factor in that Poulchesky as I'll call them were pretty cheap. All three were dire but Downing successfully pissed me off more than the other two and he did it consistently. With Poulchesky I almost felt sorry for them they were so out of their depth 

As for the carling cup final, my bullshit way of countering that argument is a stopped clock is right twice a day. My non bullshit argument would be that nobody on our squad was particularly good in that game.

Ha, no, I have a Masters in Biological sciences, they just don't want to hire people who have any ambition at all, all that seems to imply to them is that you are going to leave, then there is the other half, who expected you have have ambition and stay with them for 10 years, despite them low balling you on pay in the first place and probably continuing to if you stayed with them. 

Facts are there aren't any jobs out there, the few there are get hundreds of applicants all who have good degrees, so they just pick the ones with the MSc's and PhD's instead, I have turned up for research technician posts paying £23K only to find the person who interviewed before me had a PhD, all they need to say is that they aren't going to leave for whatever reason and they have the job over me, a job they should never even be applying for in the first place as the pay is so low.

It is being future proofed, the line is being built for 420km/h running. Currently nothing runs that fast not the French TGV or Japanese bullet trains but in 50 years when we are looking at the second generation of stock who knows.

The thing with infrastructure is that not building it isn't free, if we dont build HS2 all those journeys have to go by road and air because the WCML is &gt; 90% full at the peaks and much of that is standing room only.

It's not a perfect scheme but the compromises are to keep costs sane, ~50bn (42 for track 8 for trains) for a railway that Will last easily more than 50 years probably more than 100. I'm fairly confident about that being delivered. HS1 was on time on budget, cross rail is currently on time under budget.
IMO the claims for the north are sketchy, it will greatly help Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield and Scotland. Liverpool, Newcastle and the rest of Yorkshire not so much.

The Birmingham station is also troublesome and no one can see a better option without billions more. 
The other big gripe of mine is selling it as speed, that isn't really what it's for it would work almost as well if it ran 225kph (theoretical top speed of WCML and ECML, technically just about high speed under EU standards. The truth is it's about capacity, just once your building such a line why would you not make it 420kph design speed, that extra cost is marginal but that doesn't make a good sound byte.",0,1407270252,null,0,1407270569,0,cjhutgy,t3_2cihvi,t1_cjhutgy,t1_cjhrmlf,null,1435085963,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

However, I suspect you already know this, to be honest I don't really have any useful advice for you, I am in nearly exactly the same position but in biological sciences, the one thing I would say is you should apply for every job how terrible the description and however little you can tell what it is, if you have a well written generic cover letter that should be 90% the same for nearly every lab job anyway, just take out the 10% you change normally and make it generic as well. 

Most of the time this will completely miss the mark but occasionally you will hit it by chance and if you are only spending minutes shooting off a ""dear sir/madam"" cover letter and CV it doesn't really matter.

Limiting yourself to one area of the country is also a problem I have being applying everywhere south of Newcastle and east of Bristol and only got a few hits, normally they are no where near where I live, if I stuck to where I live I would only see one science job a month even worth applying for. 

There is also the problem of the whole academia mill, once you are out it is rather hard to get back in, as primary they just take whatever candidate has been volunteering in there lab and just as qualified as you, once you leave academia you can of start to see it for what it is, a load of people who are just doing stuff because that is what they are ""supposed"" to do without really putting much thought into it. People call this taking the opportunities that are there, but in they end they are still spending 4-5 years of there life working their ass off for less than minimum wage to come out with a PhD that might not even be in a useful field, a lot of the time people go into a PhD and it is their first real experience of research, they get through it and what they learnt is they never want to work in a lab or that kind of environment again, they would have left far earliest, but they are locked in by the whole 4 year PhD thing where they claim its you learning as a student, but in the end you are just being paid shit all to run a project for someone else with no raises over the time you are doing it.",0,1407270619,null,0,false,0,cjhv0z0,t3_2cmfsr,t1_cjhv0z0,t3_2cmfsr,null,1435086104,1,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,1

true,youngmakeupaddict,null,MOD,"Proactiv is really bad for your skin - I really recommend you stop using it! There are other great brands. The Garnier Moisture Match moisturiser in 'Dry to Very Dry' has completely gotten rid of my dry/flaky skin! Also I've found that Sudocrem works better than Vaseline on dryness (and putting it on spots is seriously amazing. Reduced my acne scarring insane amounts).

Foundation-wise, MAC Matchmaster was lovely on me - an almost serum-like foundation with VERY buildable medium coverage. Very good if your skin is difficult to match. The serumness of it seemed to help the dryness. Using a buffing brush or the like will likely exacerbate any dryness by causing flakes, so a beauty blender (I love the Real Techniques dupe) would probably work better at smoothing any flaky skin down rather than rubbing it about. If that's not in your budget, the Bourjois Healthy Mix Serum has a similar effect (and is a cult favourite on the internet).

true,Ukgamer66,eng-yorkshire,East Yorkshire,"I wonder how many people here are thinking back to their education but for someone who  has spent almost all of their life in it until recently I think I am more than qualified to comment on our entire system seeing as I can remember lessons in nursery all the way through to completing my Masters.

So here it is, bold and unashamed.

Most of out education system is filler meant to fill out a timetable where teachers babysit those with no desire to improve themselves. Those who want to be educated (especially the shy) have their talents ignored and desired while adults deal with the disruptive minority. 

It was the same in nursery all the way through to Uni. 

We teach our children facts, but as adults we do not deal in facts. We use our skills to decipher the unknown, to seek out how to solve problems or to improve a process. We learn everyday because no size fits all. We have to be flexible. 

Yet we don't teach these skills from an early age. Instead you get to Uni, turn up to some lectures and then the bomb drops - it's up to you now.

Let's pick a random example out of the air of how bad it can be. Year 11 GCSE preparation lessons. This is ""the most important year of your life"" (I got told this every year since year 5, it lost is effect after year 7) so our science teacher was frank with us. ""Every year the science exam has questions about the human eye- sometimes it's a couple of questions totalling 4-6 marks, sometimes upto 20 so we're going to focus really hard on reviewing the eye"". We all worked hard learning about the human eye, sat mock test sections from years long gone with questions about it.

Our year there wasn't a single question in our double award science about the human eye.

Our teacher had gambled, and lost. Three in our top set got a D. Many from that class do manual labour or unskilled jobs. Some don't work at all. Less than half of that years top set went to Uni and less than 10 graduated. I somehow got an A. What do I remember about the human eye? Fuck all. Learning facts by rote only made me stressed, gave me headaches for months and at the end of it I learnt nothing. What's funny? She was a good teacher. I remember thinking she was great at teaching. She was one of the best I ever had. 

Our education system doesn't teach skills once we can read and write our names, count the timetables and learn to keep our mouths shut and our opinions to ourselves.  ",0,1407272630,null,0,false,0,cjhw4p6,t3_2co7vu,t1_cjhw4p6,t3_2co7vu,null,1435086943,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,zurthen,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"I was really disappointed with the quality of this debate. At some points it was downright shocking tbh. 

Salmond's performance was most disappointing. He refused to answer any questions on currency (as usual) until the audience was absolutely incredulous to the point of booing and jeering him. He then wasted time bickering about really petty things to do with campaigning, such as quoting a Better Together joke about how Scotland will be susceptible to attack from outerspace if it votes yes as ""Scaremongering"" (wtf?). He gained some ground a bit after that by presenting his vision of an independent Scotland but didn't make the economic points which are really important and I desperately wanted him to make. In fact he responded to some of Darling's arguments just by saying stuff like ""WELL X CHILDREN ARE IN POVERTY"". He indulged in personal attacks consistently as well.

Alistair Darling wasn't great either. He shouted over Alex Salmond constantly, even shouting him down and failed to provide any positive argument. He should have gone into more detail about more powers for Holyrood which are very popular. Both sides used catch-phrases to the point where I got bored of hearing them ""PROJECT FEAR"" ""SCAREMONGERING"" ""SEPARATION, BORDERS"" ""BETTER TOGETHER"". Alex Salmond opened so many sentences with ""BEST FOR SCOTLAND"".

As an on-the-fence yes voter though I was really disappointed with Alex's performance most of all. I know that he can debate better than that. Maybe the importance of the event was weighing down him, campaigning for independence is like his life.

The whole thing was awful.  No convincing arguments, personal attacks, ducked questions, lots of bluster and very little clarity. 0/10. What the fuck is *wrong* with our political culture.

I really hope the SNP changes it's ridiculous stance on Currency after tonight but I doubt it will. They are convinced Scottish people are too fearful to consider adopting a new currency and stupid enough to accept their argument that it's 100% certain Scotland can use the pound.

Is that an actual question? That's what we tried last time. We destroyed the African way of life, created countries out of nothing, rife with ethnic divisions. The current situation in Zimbabwe can be directly related to British policies of settling the country with white people and to the British turning a blind eye to Ian Smith.

Addressing your other points:

&gt;Will you just look the other way when London burns in unbridled violence?

Those are a couple thousand refugees. They are not what will disturb the balance of London. Like so many others before them, they will, in the majority, integrate within their ethnic communities, get a job doing some menial work, have kids who will go to English state schools and be typical Londoners, and thus integrate into British society. A few might become petty thieves or drug dealers, but no more than any other people.

Trust me, London has seen in 6 million immigrants and is all the greater now, a few thousand more won't change anything.

&gt;But ask yourself what you want *in the UK*? Do you want to import a tendency to violence? Is that what you *really* want to *clear your conscience*?

Do I want them? No more than I want any other unskilled immigrants, no. But it is not just buying what suits us on the market. It is a duty we have to these people, who come on us in times of need. Is it to ""clear my conscience""? No. I think my conscience is totally clear and don't really have any guilt pertaining to colonisation. I think this is just the definition of asylum: give a shelter to people who need it.

As for the tendency for violence, no need to import it; the hooligans of the 1970s and 1980s were overwhelmingly white Britons...

Pretty much.  I have very little family here (I'd mostly just be leaving my mom), whereas in Scotland I've got several cousins and many close friends.  I have a few friends in different cities in England, as well.  

I'm not a party-goer.  I'm quiet and rather introverted and can't be around big groups of people for very long without getting overwhelmed.  I'm fine being 'alone in a city', as long as I can find a safe spot to recharge, so to speak.  I like being in cities/towns that have a few different things to offer, like museums and theatres and botanical gardens, but isn't overwhelmingly large and spread out.

As for work, right now I own a pet supply store.  I'd be happiest if I were to continue working in that industry.  Pet owners tend to be some of the nicest, calmest, and down to earth people you'll meet.  The industry in general is a fairly amicable one, too.  I'm happy to work a lower wage job in the hopes of climbing the ladder a wee bit.  Because I have connections with some of the major food companies here in Canada, and because most big suppliers know the franchise I'm a part of, I'm hoping that will give me a bit of an advantage.

true,Tweedpatches,eng-essex,Essix innit blud.,"Modern sociology has, since the 1960s, rejected the idea that Sociology is a Social *Science* in the scientific sense of the word. Sociologists - unlike Group and Human Psychologists or Psychological theorists - reject the notion that one can be objective at all. This means that in Sociology a statement or opinion is given the same - if not higher - credence than a measurable or quantifiable fact. This is because, in their view, quantifiable fact has no bearing on reality due to all humans being different. Whilst this may seem to make a sort of sense, they then claim that their ~~political~~ ""sociological"" views apply to all people of certain groups almost regardless of time or circumstance, because in Sociology every question can be answered by asserting the existence of an invisible sociological structure that coincidentally just so happens to defy scientific observation. It's like a field-wide cognitive dissonance that they, as a group ^^^Masterfully ^^^executed ^^^contextual ^^^joke , refuse to confront.

This is intellectual dishonesty, as it allows personal preferences and bigotry a higher pedestal than detached, rational observation. However, ironically Sociologists for the most part have tended to believe only one strand of thought or one particular paradigm in each area of their field, which is why you will seldom find a sociologist who isn't a radical feminist or one who doesn't believe in the idea of race being indivisible from personality. Whilst I have nothing against radical feminism or anything similar at all, attempting to be quazi-scientific based solely on your political or social opinions is not any way to go about establishing empirical truth.

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"&gt;I'm curious why you say Musacchio is so similar to Vlad, who seems like a very unique player. Do you say this primarily because of their similar physical stature?

Yes and no. Musacchio is very good with the ball at his feet - he's an ex-Midfielder converted into a CB from River after all. Very similar to Vlad in that respect who I feel has the technical ability to be play a defensive midfield role. And both of them aren't the best in the air, or particularly physically imposing (in a Terry/Cahill/Kompany/Daws/Kaboul) type of way. Like you said - they're practically identical weight and height. 

But both of them are good tacklers (Vlad has one of the best tackling techniques ever - just extends his leg and adjusts it at the last second) and anticipate things well. I just worry we all agreed Vlad/Vert won't work - yet are keen for a similar defender (he's more like Vlad than Kaboul/Daws) to come in. That was my ''beef''. Every top EPL team has one of those imposing CB's, and always has. Think Kompany, Think Chelsea, Mertesaker is like 6'6, Vermaelen is great in the air. Skrtel is arguably Pool's best CB. Distin at Everton is a man mountain. Vidic at Utd, Stam going way back. Can we always impose our play on the big teams? How will they cope with Route One stuff, and EPL ''style'' of play? How many Stokes are there in La Liga ;) 

*Not strictly played in defence, the young Musacchio was entrusted with anchoring the midfield, testament to both his defensive prowess and ability on the ball*

Also, ironically enough - 

*He is a good reader of the game, quick enough and aggressive in the challenge - ideal when married to Pochettino’s insistence on a high defensive line. Musacchio made 108 interceptions for Villarreal last year (averaging 3.4 per game), a statistic which looks even more favourable when compared to Spurs' defenders last campaign.* **Vlad Chiriches** *who* **struggled with injury and was in and out of the side**, managed 2.48 per game - **the best across the squad.**

That's why I make the comparison between them. I think Vlad would excel in La Liga in the same way because the ball is played across the ground more and technique is much more valuable a trait in defenders there. Hell, Mascherano works as a CB in Barca's system.

&gt;I understand if you feel deterred from doing them, but there are many of us (myself included) who would appreciate threads like these.

I think I'll put another one up soon.

*facepalm*

Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,

Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,

Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs

And towards our distant rest began to trudge.

Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots

But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;

Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots

Of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.


Gas! Gas! Quick, boys!---An ecstasy of fumbling,

Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;

But someone still was yelling out and stumbling,

And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime...

Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light,

As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.

In all my dreams, before my helpless sight,

He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.


If in some smothering dreams you too could pace

Behind the wagon that we flung him in,

And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,

His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin;

If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood

Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,

Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud

Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,---

My friend, you would not tell with such high zest

To children ardent for some desperate glory,

true,neoKushan,null,null,"&gt; Pretty much. I have very little family here (I'd mostly just be leaving my mom), whereas in Scotland I've got several cousins and many close friends. I have a few friends in different cities in England, as well. 

I had one or two friends in Liverpool when I moved over, though I don't think I've spoken to anyone of them since the first couple of weeks, haha.

 &gt; I'm not a party-goer. I'm quiet and rather introverted and can't be around big groups of people for very long without getting overwhelmed. I'm fine being 'alone in a city', as long as I can find a safe spot to recharge, so to speak. I like being in cities/towns that have a few different things to offer, like museums and theatres and botanical gardens, but isn't overwhelmingly large and spread out.

In that case, Liverpool probably isn't a bad choice for you. It's famed for its partying at the weekend, mostly because it's quite close to Ireland, so people come over on the ferry for a night out or a good weekend, however there's a good amount of other stuff to do. It has a good little Arts/cinema place called ""FACT"" that is usually worth going to, even if you're not into art (They often show ""classic"" films, like Life Of Brian or Alien, stuff that is worth seeing in the Cinema). There's a few museums, it recently got a brand new kickass library, it has its own chinatown, there are numerous theatres (always something on), plenty of public parks and and gardens and it's definitely quite close together. Public transport is decent as well if anything is too far away (everything I mentioned above is within walking distance of everything else). I can't speak for other towns and cities but on paper, it seems to have what you're looking for. It also has good transport links with the rest of the country, if you want to say visit Scotland or London or whatever, there's usually a train that goes directly.

I don't know a lot about pet stores I'm afraid, but there's definitely plenty around and probably plenty of room if you wanted to set up your own. Little independent stores seem to do well enough so that seems like a good possibility, but I'd imagine that's going to be the same more or less all over the country. I don't know how much your connections will help, especially as there's a large puddle between canada and here, but good luck anyway.

&gt; Do you miss Northern Ireland or do you go back often?

I'll be honest, I don't miss it as much as I thought I would. Again, my situation seems fairly similar to yours - I was never really very close to my aunts and cousins or whatever - and I don't speak to my mum. I have 2 older brothers, one of whom moved to Ipswich years before I left and the other I don't speak to because he's a knob. My Dad is basically the only reason I ever go back and even then, I don't do it very often - maybe once every 2 years or so? It's little things that I miss, like [some of the food I grew up with](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda_bread). You can get it here, but it's not quite the same. If/when he eventually goes, I doubt I'll visit Northern Ireland again.

Strangely enough, in my current job I tend to visit Canada every few months on business. Usually Toronto, so I'm not sure how relevant it will be to your experiences, but I felt fairly at home there so hopefully the same will apply to you, if you do come over.

If and when you do decide to come over for a visit, by all means feel free to fire me a PM or whatever and I'll give you some advice on getting around and stuff, so you're not totally lost. It's not a difficult city to navigate at all, especially when you know what to look for (Hint: there's [a building](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_City_Tower) right smack-bang in the middle of it that can usually be seen from most places in the city centre, if you ever get lost, just head for it and you'll find your bearings).

First off, it's not fact that going to Rose was the first thing he did, in fact, in the 50th, the War Doctor said he was 800 years old, and then the 9th Doctor said he was 900 years old, though he would not have even thought of his looks when he first saw himself in the mirror in the episode Rose, so I believe there is inconsistency there.

Secondly, There is actually large gaps of time in which we don't see the Doctor and Rose while they are together.  There are several episodes where they talk about past adventures they had together which don't correspond to events in the show, and it is presumed that Rose traveled with the 9th Doctor for about a year (in their timelines) before he regenerated into the 10th.

Finally, while they may be traveling through all of time and space together, there are many times that they are separated from each other, for example, Dalek or the Empty Child.

-No striker now that he's injured? How about Valencia? Did you forget him? What about Elliot Lee, who has now scored 9 times in this preseason? Carlton Cole is efficient when given the opportunity, too.

-Speaking of Kouyate, the midfield is already better than it was last year. If Sam can be convinced to drop Nolan, we'll really be cooking with fire. Poyet offers competition to Noble and hopefully this Ravel thing blows over.

If we get relegated it will be because we hold on to Sam for too long. He's proven completely one dimensional and spends his time trying to force square pegs into round holes instead of finding square holes to fit the pegs he's got.

Indeed it isn't. Brutal dictatorships like Mugabe's tend to have that effect. Yet it's no more their fault that they are under Mugabe's heel than it is the North Korean's fault that they suffer under Kim Jong-un. But somehow I never hear the suggestion that NK refugees are trying to get a free ticket because their country sucks.

&gt;But they should do it themselves, and they shouldn't just get a free ticket into our country because their country sucks. 

What I really don't understand is why being born in Asmara makes you somehow more deserving of living under a horrible dictator than being born in London. Because if it doesn't, you should have no objections to us providing Eritreans a safe haven.

And I really resent your insinuations that the fact the Africans are incapable of shaking off their dictatorships themselves is their fault: as the Soviet Union showed for 70 years, resistance to totalitarianism is easier said than done. Zimbabweans tried to rise against Mugabe; they got killed for their trouble.

That's looking at it pessimistically, and I hope they all do well this year, but I think it is a case of really crossing our fingers and hoping for the best.

If they all stay fit and are rotated well, then it should be ok.  But if one or more of them gets injured for a substantial amount of time, then we're kinda screwed.  If Ade goes down for a while or goes AWOL mentally, I don't really like our chances of having only Bobby and Kane for two whole competitions, especially if the former is still struggling to bang them in regularly.

A fourth striker might seem like a luxury if Poch's intention is only going to play one up top, but considering scoring goals has been one of our big weaknesses lately, and looking at the firepower of the teams above us, not to mention the question marks over all three of our current guys, I think it's more of a necessity.",0,1407277923,null,0,false,0,cjhyt5l,t3_2cpbww,t1_cjhyt5l,t1_cjhppru,null,1435088384,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

It might seem hard to believe now, but the Albert Dock was one of the busiest ports in the country; it wasted away in the 70s and 80s before being redeveloped into its current state over the last 15-20 years. 

The Albert Dock also features the Liverpool Wheel - I've not been on this so can't really offer any guidance about it. 

Further south is the King's Dock, behind which is the Liverpool Echo Arena (once intended to be the site of a new Everton stadium). 

Further south than this becomes residential (if she reaches a pub called the Coburg (I think it's missing the 'B'), she's gone too far), so she'll want to head back up Wapping (the main road). 

There are two choices - shopping or more cultural stuff. I'll assume culture. If she would prefer to shop, Liverpool One is the place (we have a store there called Everton Two, so its address is ""Everton Two, Liverpool One"").

The next place to go, really, is the Anglican Cathedral. That's the one that looms over the city - it's visible from the waterfront, but I'd recommend not walking to it; it's hard to find if you don't know the way. 

From there, I'd recommend the Catholic Cathedral. Within walking distance - and a taxi would rip you off if you asked to go from one cathedral to the other - come out of the Cathedral, go down the small hill, turn right. Go past LIPA and turn left on to Hope Street. Keep walking for a couple of minutes and you see it; it's fascinating to look at. Nicknamed Paddy's Wigwam for obvious [reasons.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Liverpool_Metropolitan_Cathedral_at_dusk_%28reduced_grain%29,_corrected_perspective.jpg)

By then she'll probably want some lunch, but I can't recommend too much beyond Eatwell - the best bacon butty shop in England. Cheap, too. To get there, go back down Hope Street and turn left when you reach the Philharmonic Dining Rooms. Follow the road around the bend and you go past a college and reach Avis Car Hire. It's opposite with a black sign, on the other corner to the Blackburne pub. 


These are the things I'd recommend doing (Eatwell especially; I've not had one in months and I'm making a special trip on Friday just after talking about it here).

Slavery continued as an accepted part of society under the Roman Empire and after; Anglo-Saxons continued the slave system, sometimes in league with Norse traders often selling slaves to the Irish. ^[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_British_Isles)

It was principally about spheres of influence and dominance over rival European nations. Germany was an economic powerhouse with more liberal domestic policies than the UK. The reason the UK went to war was because they wanted to cling onto their #1 position in Europe. 

And as it turned out, the thing was a bloody mess with no real conclusion other than the declaration of independence of many central European states, the fall of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman empires, the emergence of America as the dominant military and economic force in the world and the perfect conditions required for WW2.

The support of City over the last 30 years has been a support of mediocrity, like other Clubs sure, but we've also been sat next to a Club that made themselves the biggest Club in the world at the same time.  If you can come up with a better method of torture, you let me and GCHQ know.

I respect Manchester United and their team greatly.  I resent them even more.

This moment isn't about some random season in 11/12, it was an exorcism of a long held demon.  City have been close to a trophy on numerous occasions over those decades and managed to throw it away every single time.  Aguero wasn't victory, Aguero was redemption.  It was every trip to Mansfield, every beating from Millwall, every bullshit Saturday watching us be embarrassed.  It was Gillingham, Blackburn, Liverpool and Bolton.  It was every snide remark and pisstake from every United fan.  It was every cockney red with a twice yearly used season ticket.  It was prawn sandwiches versus sausage barms.  It was our man in Mancini embarrassing the greatest manager who ever lived.

Everything we might become started from this moment.  A perfect merging of old City and new City into one second in time, the desperation and despair to the elation and euphoria in the space of a couple of minutes.

There are not many times in football when the game is poetic; I don't mean tossers writing poems about it, I mean truly poetic that reflect decades of pent up emotion outpouring towards a single source.

Every City fan became a giant that day, and freed themselves from the shackles of their recent history.  Every City fan saw the rebirth of the Mancunian Club who triumphed decades before many of the ""Sky Four"" knew what a trophy looked like.

People tell me that this wouldn't mean much.  These people are generally teenagers from India who haven't lived what I and the other City fans have lived.  

This moment is nothing at all to do with achievement, it is to do with the realisation of the dreams of thousands of people who never believed that they would see it.  Winning the Cl will never compare to this single moment, even if we win it in extra time or on penalties.  

EDIT:  Sometimes people from far away ask me why I rate Mancini so much.  Mancini pointed at the sign at Old Trafford and told the world he'd tear that down.  Then he beat them 6-1 then forced them to tear it down after 3 decades.  If you don't see the importance of this then you shouldn't be talking about City.

Not because of any argument for justice, fairness, but because it will provoke ""radicalisation"". She has given an ultimatum that we must back Muslims or risk terrorist attacks. I would like to hope we are not that risk averse that we submit to such disgraceful threats even if they come in the veiled writings of a member of parliament in a desperate attempt to manipulate that which politicians care for the most, public opinion. Warsi stands down because we, like Israel make a stand and don't give into terrorism. We stand up, she stands down, you can't explain that. It's so outraging that I would be tempted to promote the notion that she should be arrested for terrorism charges or sending threatening correspondence. However, I may not always like it but everyone should have the freedom to express themselves. This is what sets the secular and rational British apart from Muslims.

I don't really like saying a small part of that because I'm not a particularly strong fan of Israel (or Gaza). I'm somewhat apathetic if religious nutjobs want to off each other. Never-the-less, I feel what I have to say here is the absolute truth.

All I could think of in those last 5 minutes was how we'd never live down blowing the league in such spectacular fashion. How I'd never live it down with my rag mates, they'd never let me forget it for the rest of my life. It was in our grasp and we'd thrown it away, and to a team managed by Mark fucking Hughes of all people.

I felt physically sick in those last 5 minutes. It was unbearable. Overwhelming. We were all stood up and I could only slump forward, one foot placed on the seat in from of me, my weight bearing on one leg. Resigned to the misery of failure. Wondering how City could do this to me.

Typical City had reared its ugly head, and it was uglier than it had ever been before.

By the time Dzeko had scored I'd long lost hope. I didn't even celebrate it. I refused to get my hopes up. I wasn't going to allow that hope to truly kill me. I knew we'd blown it, it was too little too late.

But then Sergio picked up the ball on the edge of the penalty area, and then played a one two with Balotelli..

I was wired. Transfixed.

When that ball hit the back of the net, I truly lost myself.

I've never experienced anything like it in my entire life, and probably never will again.

A true out of body experience. For a brief few seconds I didn't even know who I was or where I was, it was like a dream.

People were falling on me, it didn't even register.

The purest, most exhilarating high I've ever felt in my entire life.

Then, several seconds later, I come out of this out of body experience, and I'm just consumed with euphoria. I truly realise what's happened and what it means. People are crying, I hug my dad.

A minute later I'm running down the stairs, hurdling the advertising hoardings and running the onto the pitch.

I was exhausted, physically and emotionally, and just dropped to my knees. I look up at the sky, beautiful City sky blue, and as my eyes come back down I see Joe Hart's surname on the back of his shirt, and countless blues diving all over him.

The euphoria was heady and overwhelming, a mixture of relief and unrestrained joy.

It lingered for days, before levelling out at a constant for the entire summer.

Reus would be a big statement that would get Liverpool fans very excited (and have an inverse effect on many other fans) and (at the very least) go a good way towards filling in the goal vacuum left behind by Luis. He could hat trick against Norwich if they make it back to the PL after this season, and he'd look absolutely fantastic in non-Bayern red (already looks good in yellow so the away kit will suit him) and perhaps get along well with Can while they both settle in to the team (no assumptions, just that they'd start out with at least one thing in common). Would contribute well to keep us challenging for the title and garner interest from potential fans and sponsors.

The way I see it, Shaqiri could be better in the longish run with the way our first team is currently looking. Coutinho, Henderson, Sturridge, Can, Ilori, Suso, Sterling, Ibe, Flanagan, Teixeira, Marković and Coates are all 24 or younger, with all of those but Henderson Sturridge and Coates being 22 or younger. Obviously we want to follow up on our success from last season, and we've lost a star in Suárez. It'll be a big challenge, but if we can maintain top 4 BPL football, and do it with the current squad (plus Shaqiri and maybe another prominent striker), we could be seeing 12 or so of our highly skilled players peaking between 4 and 7 years from now if we can hold on to them, which could see Liverpool being a very dominant team worldwide, and one with a sustainable lineup of stars.

true,[deleted],null,null,"A nation state has a duty to protect its citizens or subjects, born or converted.   It does not have a duty to protect everyone possibly being harmed in the world.  

As to your Jewish question- Britain did not go to war to save the Jews, it went to war to stop Hitler taking over mainland Europe.    Saving the Jews from extermination was, especially given that I have Jewish heritage myself, a very welcome side effect, but certainly not the principle motive behind the conflict.   

I do not, however, advocate the same for Eritrea or indeed North Korea.  Mainly because those nations pose us no immediate threat, but secondly because when we have previously meddled in those regions of the world, things usually got worse.  

Someone born in London does not 'deserve' to be safe and prosperous any more than someone born in a poor tribe in Africa.  But in the same way that I'm not going to donate every penny of my income above the global mean (which is perhaps a couple thousand dollars a year) to charity, I do not believe we have a duty to help everyone who is suffering in this world, because that's a lot of people, and we don't have enough time and/or money to help them all. 

As for the Zimbabweans and North Koreans, both Mugage and Kim Il had massive popular support upon the start of their rule, far more so than Lenin or Mao ever did.  

I think your second-to-last paragraph is especially telling though.  Most Africans do not labour under police states even a tenth as well-built or totalitarian as those of East Germany or the Soviet Union.   African states are disasters because of executive conflict and endless tribal conflicts which in many cases existed before the Europeans arrived, and continue now that we are gone.

&gt;""Consistent with its complex history, Britain was not particularly receptive to Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazi regime in Germany, and the other fascist states of Europe. Approximately 40,000 Jews from Austria and Germany were eventually allowed to settle in Britain before the War, in addition to 50,000 Jews from Italy, Poland, and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Despite the increasingly dire warnings coming from Germany, at the Evian Conference of 1938, Britain refused to allow further Jewish refugees into the country.

&gt;Even more important to many Jews was the permission to settle in the British-controlled Mandatory Palestine. In order to try to maintain peace between the Jewish and Arab populations, especially after the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, Britain strictly limited immigration. This limitation became nearly absolute after the White Paper of 1939 all but stopped legal immigration. During the War, Zionists organised an illegal immigration effort, conducted by ""Hamossad Le'aliyah Bet"" (the precursor of the Mossad) that rescued tens of thousands of European Jews from the Nazis by shipping them to Palestine in rickety boats. Many of these boats were intercepted and some sank with great loss of life. The efforts began in 1939, and the last immigrant boat to try to enter Palestine before the end of the war was MV Struma, torpedoed in the Black Sea by a Soviet submarine in February 1942. The boat sank with the loss of nearly 800 lives.""

Watched him all through the youth cup and next gen series when we lost to Villa in the final, and he's very talented. But he's playing with lads his own age and he doesn't dominate games, he disappears for 85 minutes then taps in a shit goal in the other 5. His strength on the ball is tremendous for someone of his size, his dribbling is good, but he's no Zola as someone else mentioned. Good youth player, could never see him breaking into the first team (seems like hes got a shocking attitude as well, maybe that's just me).

To answer the Dom Solanke comment, Solanke looks the better player to me. Feruz is a Sessegnon type, creative 10, even though he plays up top. Solanke is an out and out striker, absolutely bullies defenders who have 2,3,4 years on him (a big difference for 16 years of age) and is a very crafty finisher. Good good player, but how many 16 year olds have been out of this world then gone to shite?

&gt;__Wanker__ is a term that literally means ""one who wanks ([masturbates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation))"" but has since become a general insult. It is a [pejorative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative) term of [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) origin common in [Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) and other parts of the English-speaking world, including [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland), [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) and [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand). It initially referred to an ""[onanist](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/onanist)"" and is [synonymous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym) with the word *[tosser](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tosser)*.

The players we've picked up seem better than our current options in those positions, which is what you wan't when you're going up, and the return of Mike Williams from injury will be good for cover, though I can't see him replacing any of our back line.

My only concern is we've got only three recognised forwards, one of whom is Kyle Perry.

2. Bojan (Very exciting to watch on the ball, he's already scored 2 in 2 in our preseason)
    Arnautovic (Managed to have a good first season in the prem with us, absolute showboater but has got a great strike on him)

true,Dark_Ethereal,null,null,"This has really creeped me out.

I've recently found my self in a situation where I am all but certain I am going to fail my second year of University, so I'll have to retake the year, incurring higher fees.

But on top of this, I feel like I've made the wrong choice anyway. I want to do the course, but I feel like I should have held of and got a proper job first. I've messed up this year and I feel like nothing's going to change, and I may fail again and be out of the course for good if I just try to re-take.

So I feel trapped. If I re-take the year, I think there's a concerning chance that I'll fail again, but if I leave the course, I'll have to start from the first year again, which means I'll have to pay for the final years without a student loan.

When I applied for uni, the message from the education system was that you won't get a good job if you don't have a degree, and it felt like I wouldn't be happy without one. Now I think I wasn't ready, and I still aren't. Uni isn't important.

I feel like I've got serious psychological issues with work and responsibility. I feel like I've got no control over my self because my entire perception of the world changes when I get anxious about the work and I stop caring about anything, but even though I feel like I'm not in control, I feel like it's all my fault, and then I hate my self, and I've got lots of reasons to not like my self. I feel like a shell of a person sometimes. I lie to people about how bad my situation is and I feel caught up in the lie.
I feel so far down the rabbit hole that it'd just be better to let go and hit rock bottom.  
But bizzarly there's another part of my self that thinks I'm the smartest most intelectual thinker and everyone else seems to be complete and utter morons. I feel like I've got something to offer that nobody else has, but at the same time, I feel like the worst kind of human, a complete waste of an IQ.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's tough but I'm going with same top 4 as last year in the same order.

1. City - Oil money buys you titles, what can you say? They'll have a stronger squad in the PL because of their FFP penalty in the CL, more players will be rested. Their squad is ridiculous and I can't see anyone topping them.

2. Liverpool - maybe I'm too optimistic but I don't think we'll miss Suarez that much. Gerrard created more goals and chances. Coutinho will step up, Sterling will step up, Sturridge will be able to play on his own as he wanted and make those partnerships with Cou, Sterling and Stevie even stronger. Lallana will definitely bag a few, as will Markovic. As long as we solidify our full backs (which seems to be happening) then I'm confident that, while we may only hit 80-90 goals, we will concede 30-40 rather than the 50+ of last year. And well get more points for it. More 1-0s.

3. Chelsea - still haven't solved their striker problem imo. Drogba is 10 years past his prime. He's good, and Mou knows how to get the best out of him, but I don't see him being the hero the Chelsea fans romanticise him as. Costa? Overrated to shit. His top goals in a season (all competitions bearing in mind) before last season was 10. In all comps. For an out-and-out striker that's shocking. He was awful for Spain. I don't see him adapting to the Prem, he won't have any time on the ball. He may get 10-15 goals. But he won't be a solution. Equally I think that the top managers/teams will wise up to Mou's anti-football and they'll be cracked more easily. Having said that, they're still a very good team and they'll bag the easy wins which we always seem to fail to do.

4. Arsenal - Sanchez was a great signing it has to be said. But I still think the rest of their team is overrated. He won't get the service he needs...Ozil was mediocre at best last season. They'll struggle against the top teams as usual. But I think in the end Wenger will find a way to get 4th...again.

5. United - Will the lack of European football help them? Eh...I don't think it did much either way for us and it will be the same for them. They haven't made any significant signings except Herrera. I didn't see the match yesterday unfortunately but he seems to be a good signing from what I've heard. However Rooney is overrated as much as Costa. Shaw was the biggest overpricing since Andy Carroll. De Gea was the only player for them last year who stood out. I think he'll be the one to win them points, but their squad needs a *serious* overhaul. Like 10 players in. They beat us yesterday with a lot of luck (from what I read) and by taking their chances. But they won't get that lucky constantly. LVG is a good manager. But he's no Fergie for them. He's not even a BR. He might get them back into Europe but I don't think without 3 serious marquee signings they'll be able to reach CL. And they need CL for those signings imo. 

6. Tottenham - solid side with a good manager. Haven't actually seen what transfers they've done but I'd be confident they'll be up there. But not as close as people say. They're a good team. They're not great.

7. Everton - Similar Tottenham to be honest. I don't really know who they've brought in but you can bet they'll be up there. I like Martinez and he's a good manager. Could easily pip Tottenham to 6th but I don't think they'll get much higher. Possibly 5th if united crash and burn.

 I was really hoping we would get Vorm. Since that's not happening I would feel much more confident with somebody like Marshall. Or how about Ruddy? Norwich is down and IMO he is a PL quality keeper.

I'm in the same situation as you regarding the second year troubles right now, and so many times I've convinced myself not to bother carrying on, but I took a year out before starting uni wherein I got an average job due to having little faith in university (working your way up, data input, sorting files etc type stuff), and in retrospect, while it ended up being really shit, for me it's been a fantastic source of motivation to keep trying with uni, even if it means retaking the entire year.

I guess what I'm trying to say is try not to quit uni unless you're absolutely sure it's what you want. Perhaps at most, talk to someone about taking a year out to find your footing and work out what your next move might be. If in the process you realise you enjoy something elsewhere, go ahead and enjoy; if not, uni will still be waiting with open arms. No doors are closed for you.

You sound a lot like me. Reading your paragraph on psychological issues I can totally relate. I just dropped out of university after re-sitting my second year. It took me 3 years to finally get the proper help I needed. I just went to the doctors one day, lucked out with a doctor who was willing to listen to what I had to say about my depression and worked with me to get me on better meds and does regular checks on me as well as putting me into therapy, I'm not saying everything is great, because it's not, but I feel much better than I did at university. 

Dropping out wasn't a decision I took lightly, and there are times where I regret it. I still don't know if I've done the right thing, I haven't got the ideal job, I haven't got the independence I had at university or the same social network, but i've managed to get on the path to improving my mental health state which before was so debilitating that it prevented me from achieving anything. 

My advice to you would be to go and talk to your doctors, see what they say. Try and have an open and honest dialogue with your best friend about what will be right for you. Work to figure it out. 
If you need to take a year out and do some mundane work to build up a bit of financial capital, that's an option. If you need medication and you see an improvement by September, you could see yourself reinvigorated to do your course again. Everyone says dropping out of university isn't the end of the world, but sometimes it fucking feels like it, so choose wisely.

&gt;

&gt;__Plastic Paddy__ is a pejorative term for members of the [Irish diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_diaspora) who [appropriate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_appropriation) (often stereotypical) [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people) customs and identity. The term has also been applied to those with no ancestral connection to Ireland or who claim Irish identity or nationality. A *plastic Paddy* may know little of actual Irish culture, but nevertheless assert an Irish identity.   The term is [pejoratively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative) used to refer to people on the basis of their perceived lack of authenticity as Irish.

I  do think that going to Rose was his first act after regeneration...I kind of like the theory that after seeing the Moment appear as her, he was subliminally drawn to the real Rose (that kind of thing definitely falls within the scope of the way the show portrays his, and the TARDIS's, interactions with time).  I think the inconsistency is covered by the well-established fact that the Doctor lies (especially about his age), and by the frequent hints that he doesn't really know how old he is anymore.  Now, the times when they are separated:  I do actually remember one such time, though (and my memory is fuzzy here) I thought we saw what he was doing during that time.  Maybe there are more, I don't know.  And yes, I remember them referring to other unseen adventures, though none that fit the pictures (that we know of, anyway).  The part that doesn't really fit, in my opinion--and it IS just opinion, I'm not trying to present it as more--is the notion that Rose avoided being in the pictures, or taking part in those adventures.  That doesn't really fit with her general devil-may-care attitude about interfering with the timeline, even after she learned a little bit of caution due to the incident with her father's death.
At any rate, I'll acknowledge that it's possible there were times that those things could have happened.  Not many possibilities, though, I think.  Truthfully, what I really think happened is that the writers didn't think through the ramifications of what they were showing; they were just trying to get the show rolling, establish some linkage to the classic series, and not get cancelled after one season.  In those early days, everything else was secondary, including details like this.

1. I'm not sure if it's just me, but the lion in the banner seems to cover up the start of Villa.     
If I remember correctly, in #header-img.default-header, you have margin-left: 50% which will put 50% of the margin width on the left side and this overrides margin-right so you have an off center image. Replacing margin-left and margin-right with margin:0 auto; should fix this.

2. *This is more so a personal opinion:* I've always been a fan of what /r/premierleague has done with the partly transparent logo and I was thinking maybe this is something that we could do with what the logo you currently have in the banner? Then that way in the header we could have something like what [/u/TheKingMonkey linked](http://i.imgur.com/PKRZ8Fm.jpg) a little bit ago.

true,phishsticker,lfc68,,"I actually disagree. I think we lineup the way we do BECAUSE BR is trying to fit Stevie into the side. He was tried further forward and didn't have the legs to play the position. BR tried Lucas and Stevie together as a midfield 2 but neither of them are athletic enough to make up for each others weaknesses. 

So basically in order to fit Stevie into the side he was pushed back into the CDM role because although hes not good defensively he brings experience, leadership and is fantastic on set pieces. I wouldn't say he is comfortably the best at CDM because he lacks the main attributes which make a good CDM. Lucas is very slow now but you can tell he's a defensive minded player because he positions himself well and shields the back four. He is always able to cover for both FBs well because of this. 

Stevie lacks that defensive awareness which is why we are so susceptible to counter attacks and breaks from midfield against pacey teams. He has a very hard time covering for FBs and also often forgets to track his man in midfield which led to conceding goals last season. He's been my favorite player for the past 10 years and I have had him on almost every kit i've bought, but at this point I truly believe that if we had someone else in the side who was fantastic at set pieces I think we would be a more balanced side without Stevie in that CDM role. I wouldn't mind trying Hendo in that holding role as well. He's played the position quite a bit for the U21 England side, the only issue is his current pressing is so important to the team (which could possibly be replaced by Lallana) it would almost limit him as a player.",0,1407300759,null,0,1407305669,0,cji93f5,t3_2cr2qd,t1_cji93f5,t1_cji6obn,null,1435094569,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

All three of those players can press exceptionally well and are a threat in front of goal. Henderson on the other hand creates a lot space for other players but he's not that great in front of goal as it is and is not much of a threat up front.

Our issue is Gerrard is so weak defensively, and as a team last year we were so poor defensively so that's something we need to improve drastically. Having him as the lone CDM, whether it was 4-3-3 or 4-1-2-1-2 we were often easily exposed in the midfield. We played 4-3-3 quite a few times last season and when Coutinho / Henderson pushed forward Gerrard still was left isolated. I think 4-3-3 is BRs ideal formation but Gerrard isnt defensively good enough. It's the only reason we would possibly play 4231. It doesn't create more space for Gerrard to cover, he's already responsible for covering either FB when they push forward; and its been obvious it's physically something he cant do. 4231 you have a compact midfield 3 using the FBs for width. But that brings back the point of the OP, we are basically putting a square peg in a round hole in order to fit Stevie in the squad.

Sturridge? Not sure that Liverpool can be anywhere near as good as they were last year sans Suarez. He was their #9 *and* #10.

Rooney? RvP? Not sure if United can be good enough.

Lukaku? Not sure if Everton are good enough.

Add to that Rodriguez has had only 1 good season scoring 15 league goals. In 2012-13 he only managed 6 while playing 2 more games.

Most of our great wins last season had us playing 4-3-3 with Gerrard as the holding mid. Our defensive record is not poor because of Stevie. Look at our match against City at the end of last season. We were great in midfield. Our weakness has been that our fullbacks are absolute shit. Every talented winger can just run past them and whip in a cross. Our defenders and our GK are shit at handling crosses because they're always watching the ball.

4-2-3-1 was when we looked absolute shit on the other hand. Henderson and Gerrard gets stuck too deep and we can't make use of neither Coutinho's nor Hendo's great engine. 

Edit: Read your other post too. You're far off. We aren't exposed in the middle. All dangerous attacks start on the wings against us. Our fullbacks lose a 1v1 and suddenly the whole pitch opens up. They can push up the pitch and essentially nullify the offside rule and strikers can outpace our cb's. If they don't outpace them they still create havoc because none of our CB's can clear the fucking ball. Look at all our goals versus United.

It's also worth remembering the largest Jewish population outside of Israel is in the US. There are actually only slightly fewer Jews in the US than there are in Israel. They make up about 2% of the population and infact there are probably considerably more people who, though they don't identify as Jewish, are the descendents of Eastern European Jewish migrants from the 1880s onwards. Cast this aside the roughly 2.6 million US muslims who make up just 0.6% of their population and who often come from places like Indonesia which are arguably less invested in the Israel-Palestine situation than say British Muslims from places like Syria, Iraq and even Pakistan. That compares to a Jewish population of about 0.5% the total population in the UK, whilst Muslims make up closer to 5%...

Slang is regional- best way to think of it- assuming you are not a Newfie- is to imagine you are starting a job at a school in St Johns. You'll pick it up as you go.

Depending on which part of Canada you're from, you'll likely hear fewer Canadian artists on the radio and a lot less French language. Milk cartons won't have bilingual packaging nor will anything else that you buy in supermarkets or anywhere- so you won't have to turn them round to work out what's written on them.

Swearing is an interesting one. You're likely to be familiar with most of the swear words in the UK- apart from ""bollocks"" which refers to testicles but is usually synonymous with ""bullshit""- but their severity is different here.

Example would be the word ""cunt"" which is sometimes used as a friendly greeting between particularly close friends, yet can also be used very viciously. A difference between Canada and the UK regarding the use of that word is that it is very rarely used to refer to a female in the UK.

What the public need is well publicised corporate links like they had back in the '80's regarding South African trade when the Torys were still supporting apartheid.  This action, along with things like political resignation, helps publicise the issue and demonstrate public opinion. 

Back in the day, the UK government wouldn't impose trade sanctions on South Africa, so a lot of the population did it themselves by avoiding goods and services from SA or those involved with the regime.  It might sound far fetched but after large losses from a publicised campaign, Barclays Bank pulled out of South Africa in 1986.  It could even be said that this type of action worked politicly as even David Camaron seems to have distanced himself from his own personal support for P.W. Botha.

Apart from Jaffa Oranges, people have no idea which companies are involved in Israel. Intel is a good example of this.  If you know who owns what - its not hard to avoid stuff when you know where its from.

Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,

Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,

Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs

And towards our distant rest began to trudge.

Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots

But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;

Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots

Of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.


Gas! Gas! Quick, boys!---An ecstasy of fumbling,

Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;

But someone still was yelling out and stumbling,

And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime...

Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light,

As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.

In all my dreams, before my helpless sight,

He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.


If in some smothering dreams you too could pace

Behind the wagon that we flung him in,

And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,

His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin;

If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood

Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,

Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud

Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,---

My friend, you would not tell with such high zest

To children ardent for some desperate glory,

Life's not a race. When you think of all the possibilities out there, and how much we change as individuals, and how little we know when we're young, the chances of your picking the career that's perfect for you the first time round is minuscule. But that's not an issue, it's an opportunity. The flexibility and freedom to try whatever jobs you want.

Whether or not you're ""behind in life"" depend who you compare yourself to. The fact that you have access to Reddit, a roof over your head and clean water already puts you ahead of the majority of the world in life.

If you've got a degree from a British university puts you even further ahead in life.

You could probably stop working right now, sit on your ass all day, and soak up state benefits, and still have more in your life than the majority of the world population.

The fact that you've got through university, and you worry about your future career suggests to me that you'll be just fine. So now you can stop worrying.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Nah not having that at all. It's been mentioned already but it's not all Gerrard's fault. Our style of play last season was based on a diamond of Henderson, Coutinho, Sterling and Suarez/Sturridge with Gerrard sitting deeper than Henderson. Our full backs were encouraged to bomb forward at every opportunity to create overlap on the wing and allow the players in the diamond to cut in and create with Suarez/Sturridge.

This worked well but meant that our full backs were found [too high up the pitch](http://i.imgur.com/D8Y8cG0.png) ([also see Flanno](https://s1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/Mm_BE8jSBd1bCn2FPLalGA--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYzMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/blogs/pitchside-europe/3103_Flanno_heat_map.jpg)) and this left two rather large, full-back shaped holes either side of Gerrard and a whole load of empty space.

Fitness is the most important factor using this style of play and you can see that all three (the two full backs and Gerrard) began to tire, letting in [33% more goals](http://ohyoubeauty.blogspot.de/2014/05/liverpool-goals-for-and-against-2013-14.html) in the second half of matches.

As opposed to supporting Russian roughshod expansionism? I think it was you who noted that the Kaiser was looking to expand into Poland. As someone with Polish heritage, I can tell you that Poland at the time didn't exist and there were 3 reasons why: Russia, Germany and Austria-Hungary. The war was about imperialism, to pretend that we went to war for some romantic notion of liberty is wrong. 

&gt;were then obligated to allow Germany to expand into the territory of Our European allies?

We had a history of picking fights with both the Russians and the French, they weren't so much allies as a means to contain rival power in Europe. The whole war makes no sense. What should have been a regional conflict somehow erupted into a world war, and every faction was guilty of pointless warmongering. 

&gt;I suppose because France had an empire they should have just let Germany a chunk of land then? Those bastard imperialist French ey?

I'm not saying that it was necessarily wrong to enter the war from a moral standpoint; nobody really had reasons other than to increase power and influence. What I'm saying is that it wasn't a war of ideology like the second world war, it was just an exercise in power projection.

A tunnel was used to abduct Gilad Shalit; a tunnel was used to ambush and kill four soldiers with an anti-tank weapon near Kibbutz Nir Am; a tunnel was used to ambush a military outpost near Nahal Oz, killing five soldiers; a tunnel was to attack the patrol that included Hadar Goldin, killing three soldiers. That's just the tunnels that were used to execute successful attacks on IDF forces in 2014 (with the exception of Shalit, obviously); there are plenty of others that I didn't bother to list. The existence of the tunnels is beyond the dispute of all but the tin-foil-iest of conspiracy theorists; Hamas has released video of them, as have the AP and plenty of other news sources in addition to the IDF.

The fact is, if they were the only agency around, they'd get far more business, have far more successful placements and charge far lower fees.

The issue is that the letting agency market is well over saturated, and that means all the agencies have to charge more to cover business lost to the other agencies.

I think the most important thing that needs to be looked it for Gerrard to work in the holding mid is the CB pairing and the strength of our fullbacks. We need leadership to organize our backline and Mignolet needs to start being vocal more in order to organize his defense. 

Another thing to look it is the 2 central midfielders playing in front of Gerrard. I honestly see a pairing of Henderson and Can to completely dominate the midfield for us. I can see using use a 4-1-2-1-2 with Gerrard playing holding, Henderson/Can central mid, Coutinho/Lallana playing as the #10 role, and combo of Studge/2nd striker up front.

Yes.  

&gt;Yes but how is fucking over a film festival partly funded by the Israeli embassy do that.

In my mind it works in the same way as a sporting boycott.  It doesn't effect a nations economy beyond a negligible level in any way, but it raises awareness of public opinion.  If public opinion changes, politicians *sometimes* change their policy's to fall in line with the public.  The Lib Dem's announcement today for instance.

In this case it has worked to the point that people are becoming aware of a growing discontent regarding Israeli aggression.  Its got into the news and people are talking about it. The theatre said it would not accept any funding from ""any party to the current conflict"". It has offered to use its own resources instead, so I guess that if the League of Palestinian Shawarma Salesman were supplying free snacks - they would have been asked not to attend as well.

So they cannot also be expected to also be on guard against the counter. 

That has to be the deepest lying mid + the two CBs that do that - and they do. Last season, SG was often the deepest player with the two CBs spreading out wider. This is great and should work IF everyone in that back three is highly mobile with great positioning and confidence AND the keeper is also a confident sweeper. 

I am not sure if our back unit has that trust and confidence - it requires that the wide CB is often isolated one on one, and then  trust SG to be that central defender, and you see them get narrower and fall back. 

Lots and lots of decision making required! 

Our weak defence is a product of a lot of things. I am hoping that 433 this year allows for FBs who are not required to also be wingers.

I think this guy makes a good point. Police are supposed to make us feel safe. The presence of an officer armed with a deadly weapon is not something to be sneezed at in the UK. Any normal person coming across such an officer would be instantly intimidated, even if they were just passing by.

We're just not used to this sort of thing. We'd be asking, why is the officer armed? Is something big going down here? Is it safe for me to be here? Is there about to be a gun battle?

I agree with you that it's a shame that you're judged to an extent on where you did your degree, in some companies, in some fields, but that's life. As someone who graduated in 2010, at the height of the recession, I definitely don't agree that where you got your degree was worthless, because I experienced countless rejections and saw lots of people with Oxford degrees not having the same problem. Even those who did English too! 

Only on reddit would it be some kind of wildly controversial opinion to point out that certain universities carry higher prestige (not the one I went to, so maybe you should reevaluate your attitude to Russell Group universities overall) and people who attended them more likely to acquire top jobs. 

I work in IT, where no one gives a shit if you even have a degree half the time, so of course there are exceptions to every rule - but overall?

Initially I was concerned because if you're planning to withdraw from it every 3 months, you're eating into your tax free allowance.... but then you're not likely to hit the £15,000 per year that you're allowed to deposit so it's OK. 

Just remember that the 15k is a limit on what you can *deposit* regardless of what you've withdrawn - if you put 15k into it and then withdraw it straight away, tough, you've used your whole allowance this year and can't put any more in till next year.

What I'm saying is:

&gt; When I run out of my 3 month allowance on current account, move another 3 months worth of money **out of my ISA and** into my current account.

This is generally considered unwise because you're wasting your ISA allowance. You're also losing out on a couple of months of interest by withdrawing from the ISA and leaving in a 0% current account. You might be better off with an account that pays in-credit interest, or just transferring the money every month instead of every 3 months.

He has exactly the same opportunity as every other member, if he goes to enough games.

What you're probably getting confused about is the selling procedure for cup finals (domestic and European) which does *not* have two separate allocations for members and ST holders. In those cases they go on sale to STs and any remaining (usually very little) go to members.

Unfortunately there's such a lack of low cost affordable housing in cities that landlords know they'll have little difficulty filing the tenancy.   

But if there's such demand why would landlords bother with middlemen?   Useful services estate agents provide include marketing the property (or rather providing better exposure than gumtree), taking the time to show numerous (non - paying) people round,  standardised credit report checks,  good knowledge of tenancy law in case of serious disagreement, and (in many cases) assurance of income schemes I.e.  landlord will get steady monthly payments from estate agent even if property is empty for months. 

If estate agents generally did nothing then it would be trivial to set yourself up as one and undercut what the current ones are charging.   The fact there are tons of competing estate agents shows it's easy to set one up,  but the fact that these kinds of fees (eg contact signing) have stayed where they are shows there are genuine costs to cover.

However, I'm not sure people will view that as suitable for PM. I think people want someone who commands respect as PM, and I'm not sure Boris fits that role. I think he will always be seen as a joker, and not really a serious option. Also, he will have to show his actual views a lot more, which will out him as a typical Tory.

An Authorised Firearms Officer, or a Specialist Firearms Officer (AFO or SFO) operating under normal policing duties (as in, will not be responding to any firearm incidents) will be carrying all the kit that normal police officers carry - i.e. bendy batton, incap spray, and maybe a taser, and usually a custodian helmet - this happened quite frequently during the London riots, as AFO/SFO's were pulled off firearm duties, and shoved into riot gear, and sent out with blessings.

What they seem to be talking about here is AFO/SFO's, who are on firearms detail, carrying out normal policing while they are not responding to firearm incidents - they are ready to respond to firearm incidents, so they will always be carrying their glocks.

I think if we were forced to turn back refugees - that might force us to re-evaluate whether ""colonialism"" is as bad as we think. The problem is that we don't face the issues because we convince ourselves that we're being helpful by accepting refugees.

 [**Flag of Northern Ireland**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag%20of%20Northern%20Ireland): [](#sfw)

&gt;

&gt;Northern Ireland has not had its own unique, government-sanctioned flag since the [Northern Ireland parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Northern_Ireland) and government were [prorogued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_session#Procedure_in_Commonwealth_realms) in 1972, and abolished in 1973.  During official events, the British government uses the [Union Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Flag), which is the [official flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom) of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and is the only flag used by the government in [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland). 

&gt;The [Saint Patrick's Saltire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick%27s_Saltire) is sometimes used by the government to represent Northern Ireland alongside the other countries of the United Kingdom, and is the centrepiece of the badge of the [Police Service of Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Service_of_Northern_Ireland).

&gt;The [Ulster Banner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Banner) remains in use by [unionists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_unionism), a number of sporting organisations in Northern Ireland and some local government authorities under Unionist control.

Protestantism was forced to remain a super-super secret until 6000 years later, when Martin Luther (the Prod, not the coloured guy) said it was alright to come out of hiding because the Romans had finally fled due to the Huns (that was us as well by the way - that's why the taigs call us Huns, they were really Protestants).

The distinction is when an AFO is on a firearms detail they are operating under a standing authority which covers the entire crew of an ARV. They will now have routine duties assigned to them but still have to respond to firearm incidents. In England whilst on these routine duties they will NOT carry a weapon (it will remain in the ARV) in accordance with the ACPO guidelines (which legally are more than just guidelines). In Scotland they have changed the policy to allow these officers to always be armed.


From ACPO guidelines, the carrying of a weapon is only allowed when:

&gt;they are required to conduct a specific task during which the possession of a firearm, with appropriate authorisation, is a required element.

If an AFO is doing a routine patrol then they are not covered by the standing authorisation and a firearm is not a required element (being ready to response to a firearm incident is not a specific task) so unless there a reason to grant a special authorisation (area with high gun crime) then they are not authorised to carry it.",0,1407322331,null,0,1407323078,0,cjieamb,t3_2crr1n,t1_cjieamb,t1_cjidy20,null,1435098114,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In your case I'd fill an ISA each year and put the maximum possible remaining amount into a santander 123 account (20k), get round the direct debits by paying small amounts to charities (via DD) each month (or large amounts if you're a generous person). Then with the rest I'd look at the [5% loophole](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/savings-loophole). This would still leave you with over 50k - my advice on this would be; each year to take 15k out of your santander account, fill your ISA allowance and then refill the santander account. You've got too much money to do anything else really and your aims are identical to everyone else (short term, high interest, low risk) - there's very little on offer which can meet all these needs. My only other option is zopa (pays around 5%).

As other people would say an IFA would be a good idea at this point, perhaps reinvest some into your business or fund some kind of education, build up some skills.

Finally; if you've got a partner, get them to fill their ISA allowance (and their current account allowance for santander), this would dispose of a lot of the income but you'd need to trust them as ISA literally means individual; so there would be nothing to stop them walking away with the money.

true,mmmmmh,null,null,"&gt; Unfortunately there's such a lack of low cost affordable housing in cities that landlords know they'll have little difficulty filing the tenancy.

Exactly, so why do we need letting agencies!? 

&gt; But if there's such demand why would landlords bother with middlemen?

Because with so many letting agents, tenants now believe the only way to get a house is to go through a letting agency. It doesn't matter where a private landlord advertises if all tenants believe the only way to get a place is to look in the agency window.

&gt; marketing the property (or rather providing better exposure than gumtree),

Again, if there weren't hundreds of agencies with their own exclusive sites, GumTree would be fine. Having so many different agencies makes it harder for tenants to get a convenient holistic view of the market, and means that if landlords want a holistic approach with advertising they have to deal with 10+ local letting agencies. And, most agencies also use GumTree too so.....

&gt; taking the time to show numerous (non - paying) people round,

As I said, that only applies to Landlords who don't want to be landlords. In my experience, the only houses where I've been pleased with the management and experience has been when the Landlord went to the viewings and generally did most of the work (because the agencies failed at their jobs).

&gt; standardised credit report checks,

AFAIK, that entails doing to a credit check provider, putting in a name and address (Capita charge around £1 /address for credit check IIRC). But agencies like to sell this as some daunting extensive challenge out of reach of mere mortals and charge £50+ for what is essentially 3 minutes work + a £1 fee.

&gt; good knowledge of tenancy law in case of serious disagreement

The only disagreements I've been aware of has been when an agency is involved, or when the landlord hasn't done their job properly.  Again, a proper landlord should know their job, requirements, and expectations, and be respectful to their customer. If the landlord does these things, there's no room for legal disagreement. And in the modern day of Google and forums, finding out this information isn't hard. 

&gt; and (in many cases) assurance of income schemes

Again, if the landlord is doing a good job, and the local area hasn't been flooded with agencies, assurance income wouldn't be necessary. But you're right, that is a valid service. 

Even if we do accept all those services are valid, in my experience with agencies, not 1 of the ~10 different agencies I've dealt with as a tenant has actually performed all those tasks. Even if they DID perform those tasks, the price charged is far far in excess of the actual time and effort invested in that particular property by the agent. The idea that ""we should charge our customers for all our failed attempts at getting money because they have no choice but to use us"" is basically extortion and textbook definition of racketeering.

/rant

But you're right, there are some cases where letting agencies are required, like non professional landlords (e.g. somebody letting their house over a short period whilst they live/work elsewhere.) We only need a fraction of the letting agencies we have at the moment for that though, not one on every street corner giving the impression that if you don't use a letting agencies you'll end up homeless. And there are a lot of cases where landlords don't do their job properly and that contributes to agencies bad names.",0,1407322696,null,0,false,0,cjied6v,t3_2cmpu7,t1_cjied6v,t1_cjidr4g,null,1435098144,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

This is of course despite the fact that calls for genocide and murder are not retracted, apologised for or in fact are anything other than par for the course in the Palestinian media. In fact, calls for genocide, murder, and cult-style indoctrination, especially of children, are pretty much all there is to the Palestinian media.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; The wider UK actually has quite a few political parties and there has been a trend to the vote becoming diverse.

Sadly the UK's FPTP system means that more votes for smaller parties are typically wasted.

Scotland uses the more proportional AMS, which leads to smaller parties receiving seats in proportion to their share of the vote.

Case in point, the Conservatives. Under FPTP they received MP in Scotland. However they received around 14% of the votes for the Scottish Parliament - so have around 15% of the MSPs.

&gt;Also if Scotland does vote for independence, I don't see where opposition to Salmond, Sturgeon et al. will come from.

Scottish Labour? The Scottish Conservatives? The Lib Dems? The Greens?


&gt; The SNP will control almost all levers of power and will have a disproportionate control of the building of institutions in a newly-independent Scotland. Will Labour survive in Scotland?

Controlling the ""levers of power"" is pretty normal for a government (that's how they govern). Given that the secession negotiations are going to be a cross-party project (unless you think that's a lie) then I don't see how the SNP would have a disproportionate control simply because they happen to be the current government - the referendum is not a vote for the SNP.

Scottish Labour would, if anything, be healthier after independence than they are now. Lamont is hamstrung by being unable to create policy without the UK party's approval, and spends most of her time fulminating about how awful the SNP are (primarily for successfully co-opting socially-aware left-wing policies you'd historically have associated with Labour).",0,1407323244,null,0,false,0,cjieh40,t3_2cpq63,t1_cjieh40,t1_cji10ds,null,1435098218,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Mainly for a planned overdraft. They suddenly decided (without my knowledge) to increase the interest for using the facility, which forced me into the red for about 4yrs.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxford,"I have a different assessment of the purpose of the police. I think the feeling of safety for the public is also very important. And it is just as much part of the policeman's duty to ensure the public perception of safety as it is to enforce it.

From wiki:  
&gt;In the British model of policing, police officers are citizens in uniform. They exercise their powers to police their fellow citizens with the implicit consent of their fellow citizens.

The key part is **fellow citizens**. We aren't supposed to see police as people who are superior to us in authority but rather as equals, as fellow citizens.

Obviously, they need special powers and equipment that ordinary citizens don't have in order to police when they need to. But when no crime has been committed, they are supposed to be just as approachable and non-threatening as anyone else you meet on the street, possibly even more so.

Ideally, our police would not have to wear knife-vests and carry tasers or police batons, since citizens normally wouldn't carry these things, and they are somewhat intimidating, but for very practical reasons, they need to be prepared for situations that may arise. And we as the public judge it a fair trade-off.

Carrying a firearm is a big step further though. Tasers and batons *can* cause fatal injury, but guns pretty much *always* cause fatal or severe injury, contrary to what TV would tell us about bullet wounds. The very presence of such a weapon would pretty much destroy any ability of a policeman to appear approachable or non-threatening.

That's just my own opinion on what the police should be for though. I see them as fellow citizens first, authority figures second, and their purpose is mostly to help people than to arrest people. I think this perception is a very comfortable one for me.
