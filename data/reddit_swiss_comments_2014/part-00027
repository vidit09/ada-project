This is the reason the community where you apply can have its own rules and requirements. There are/where places where each application for citizenship had to be approved by public vote.

The origin of this is that back in time, if you were to become poor and would need assistance and you did live outside your place of origin, they could kick you out and send you back to your place of origin. This is no longer the case today, but the place of origin remained an item in the naturalization process.

On municipal level, municipality can demand more than the 2 years on their municipality. So that depends on where you will live.
  
Underage children are automatically included in your demand, they only have to live in Canton Zürich for 2 years (cantonal level requirement, municipality may have longer periods).

The way you would be evidencing it is to write down all adresses where you've lived in Switzerland, they will go and ask at those places if they can confirm. You don't have to do that yourself.  

Of course additionally to the time requirements, you must speak at least one official language, be integrated, have financial stability, have no criminal record.

&gt;So you don't work in the first year?

Well it depends, some companies want you to have basic knowledge before you start working there, therefore they send you to the ZLI. But there are many companies where you don't do that. 

If you go to ZLI for the first year, you most likely get 100-200.- there were also some that got 600.- depends on who employed you. If you don't go to ZLI, you'll get 600.- no matter what. 2nd Year: 800, 3rd: 1100, 4th: 1400, After aprenticeship: 4500.- (each month)
