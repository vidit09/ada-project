I've already done that (I assure you I would not bother reddit before first attempting to cross-reference everything myself :)) and by these criteria the french-speaking part of Switzerland should be the most libertarian, but in reality it's not. So I guess the mentality of the people there is more socialistic. That's why I need Swiss people to tell me about the mentality in the different cantons.

You are absoloutely correct. Nowadays in America ""liberal"" just means ""liberal with other people's money"" :D. Allow me to clarify myself: I'm looking for classical liberal mentalities.

Yes, I understand that, but thank you for taking the time to clarify. That is why I have also emphasized *mentality of the people* in my OP.

&gt; But as in many countries, the mentality changes with where the people live. Urban people want more social engagement etc, while the rural population has different interests.

So let's say a rural commune in Geneve like Satigny would be classical liberal as opposed to the more socialistic city of Geneve?

I decided to take Switzerland up as a case study for the most free societies in the World. Switzerland's canton autonomy, while being awesome, makes it rather difficult to make a good summary without actually speaking to the people who live there, so that is why I resort to bothering Swiss redditors, for which I sincerely apologize.

Yes, I have studied your federal regulations quite extensively. The cantons, however, are what interests me the most.

But this doesn't matter on a cantonal level, because these votes are national and every canton is bound to the final result. 

The structure of our laws (the legislative if you want) is like that: National constitution, National laws and then cantonal laws. And the differences in the cantonal laws aren't that big since a lot is regulated on a national level.

false,pseudoRndNbr,null,null,"I can give you my own opinion. I consider myself a classic liberalist. 

There are 5 parties worth talking about in switzerland (From right to left: SVP (26%), FDP(15.1%), CVP(12.3%), SP(18.7%), Green Party(8.4%)).

The SP, Green Party and CVP are mostly in favor of regulation. The SP (and the green party) is generally in favor of forced redistribution of wealth. CVP is basically a center party (some say center left and some center right) meaning that they sometimes support motions from fiscally conservative parties and sometimes support motions from the left parties.

The FDP is the classic liberal party of switzerland. They are in favor of a free market and in favor of less regulation.

The SVP is probably the hardest party of the bunch to describe. They are basically national conservatists with ideas that are sometimes seen as racist by more progressive/socially liberal people. Still they support some fiscally conservative motions and are in favor of a free market. If I'm right in assuming that you are an American I would guess you can compare them to some republicans who support free markets, less regulations, but are socially conservative.


Fiscal conservatism is not really a french thing and generally the french region of the country tends to vote for left parties (And generally there's a big difference between the german and french part of switzerland. [Here's a controversial referendum we accepted some years ago](http://www.geschichteinchronologie.ch/eu/ch/kr/SVP-d/kriminelle-SVP-13-griechen-romands-d/006-schweizer-karte-ausschaffungsinitiative-28nov2010-52,9prozent-ja.gif)). So if you want fiscally conservativism you have to look at the german speaking part of switzerland. Especially many conservative regions (Center of switzerland, Mountain regions) are against big government and in favor of small government (as long as it's not about reducing military spending). If you wanna look for people with a socially liberal mindset your better of taking a look at the ""big"" cities. 



Generally classic liberalism isn't really big in switzerland, mainly because those who would generally vote for classic liberalist motions are socially conservative and tend to vote for the SVP. Most classic liberals can probably be found amongst the FDP. However the FDP has received a lot of bad press because some people see them more as a party for corperations. UP-Schweiz was actually founded by people who left the FDP for not being liberal enough.

Even though most people are not classic liberalists I would argue that a majority of swiss people think that small government is a good thing and our whole politicial system is built on the idea that the different regions should be able to decide lots of things on their own (feudalism).",0,1412415164,null,0,1412415644,0,cl03o44,t3_2i9g4p,t1_cl03o44,t1_cl03a2u,null,1426690066,1,false,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6,1
