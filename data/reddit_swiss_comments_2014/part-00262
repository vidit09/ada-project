Each region has it own charms, You can go to the Berner Oberland and Jungfrau region, the Lavaux is getting nicer and nicer as the fall is approaching, Ticino is always full of surprise, the Graubünden are wild and spectacular, Fribourg is a region of contrast, the Waldstäden unexplored, the Valais is the best place in the world...

Didn't electronic voting got cancelled in a some cantons after testing it? Again, a lot of parties don't want that because they are focused on old voters. It's the same as in the USA where Republicans try to exclude people from voting. E.g. in a lot of communities you still have to be present to vote and the vote takes place during a time that younger people would never choose which de facto excludes them from voting (it's as if we would say that you have to vote with a mobile phone from now, which would defacto exclude old people)
