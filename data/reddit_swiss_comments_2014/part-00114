In the greater scheme of things, nothing good has ever come from the lower right corner if it ever got too powerful but backwardness, stupidness - ultimately: Destruction.

I was nowhere claiming a sole rule by the SP was a great option (it wasn't called Zauberformel for nothing: If progressive forces from left to right work together, the results can be quite magical), but (even though that is completely hypothetical) it would still be a much more progressive and less destructive option, one for everyone, because it is - contrary to the SVP - a party capable of *consensus*, of *working with opponents*, ultimately a party that believes that democracy does not mean tyranny by the majority in a dog-eat-dog-society, but rule of law and live and let live.

I don't think we're looking at an absolute scale anyway, so it's relative which means that the interpretation changes with your point of view. In that case it doesn't really matter if the SVP changed or not, but all the graph says is that the SVP is positioned a lot further conservative relative to everybody else... or if you have another point of view: Everybody else went further liberal relative to the SVP looking at the past years.

Now all I said was that I wonder how one can explain that and other commentators have done exactly that, focusing on the SVP, its internal trouble and the creation of the BDP as aftermath. Maybe you can offer another explanation why everybody else went to the left and how you can be sure that the SVP has not moved at all.

No I did not mean I have another point of view. The parties move relative to the point in the middle which represents the average vote. If society adjusts its beliefs and becomes more progressive/liberal the middle point stands for a more progressive/libreal ideology than it did before. If the SVP or any other party does not change and does not become more liberal/progressive then they ""move"" farther away from the middle even though they have not changed at all. In fact it was the middle point that changed.

Now I'm not claiming the SVP stayed the same, I'm just saying you can't conclude that the SVP changed by looking at this graph. You can conclude that the average voter and the ideology the SVP represent are farther away from each other than 10 years ago. 

There are 3 possibilities you can come up with by looking at this graph:

1. The Average voters opinion changed and the SVP didn't change at all.

The part of your original post I'm talking about:
&gt; it's surprising to see that the SVP is the only large party that changed direction entirely.

Also it would be interesting to see whether the people who voted for the SVP before the changes are still voting for the SVP now. This won't be possible because there's no data on who voted for which party, but it's an interesting thing to think about. 

If the voters who voted for the SVP before the changes in the graph are still voting for the SVP now I would be inclined to speculate that it wasn't the SVP that changed but rather the Average vote and other parties, because I feel like it's easier to change the ideology of a party rather than changing a persons beliefs.

For the sake of the discussion I'd like to offer this view point:

Somebody else in this thread suggested that people might vote by habit. So not on issues directly (except for the ones with higher turnout) but rather with a mindset of ""I've always voted SVP/SP/FDP etc."" Many even get that from their parents ""My parents have always voted SVP.""/""We're an SP family."" etc.

This would explain how a party can influence its voters as well, not just the other way around. I think it's a back and forth anyway and a party does decide to what kind of people they offer a platform for their ideas in order to represent these ideas for them. These ideas can also been pushed at the voter, especially loyal voters. Politicians don't just represent, but also rally their supporters. Some even call politicians ""leaders"".
