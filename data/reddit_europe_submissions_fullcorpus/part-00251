#WHY GROSS SPENDING?
Per-capita/%GDP/per-bird-I-saw-while-walking-through-a-country measures of R&amp;D are useful for a lot of things. %GDP spending, for example, is one indicator of a country's focus on R&amp;D relative to other... uh, stuff. What those statistics don't do is give you a good idea of just *how much R&amp;D a country actually does*, which is really quite important and shouldn't be ignored.

Gross spending *doesn't* tell you what kinds of R&amp;D a country does. Countries that spend more on R&amp;D tend to do more in any given field when compared to countries that spend less, but it's often wildly disproportionate: [Norway, for example, is way down at #33 in overall expenditure for 2014, but is **#4** in the world in fossil fuel RD&amp;D spending.](http://stats.oecd.org/BrandedView.aspx?oecd_bv_id=enetech-data-en&amp;doi=data-00488-en)

#SOME HIGHLIGHTS

- The whole world spent around $1,600,000,000,000 (1.6 trillion) on R&amp;D in 2014. The top three (the US, China, and Japan) account for *more than half* of global R&amp;D spending.

- The United States is an R&amp;D juggernaut, spending more on R&amp;D than anyone else by a gigantic margin (they spend 61% more than #2, China, who in turn spends 58% more than Japan). Nearly one out of three (31.1%) dollars spent on R&amp;D was spent in the USA.

- Regionally, Asia spent more than the Americas or Europe. Most of Asia's spending comes from China (17.5%), Japan (10.2%), and India (2.7%)

- The Americas account for the second largest piece of the pie, at 33.9% of the total. 91.7 out of 100 dollars spent on R&amp;D in the Americas is spent in the US.

- Around one out of five (21.7%) dollars spent on R&amp;D was spent in Europe. European countries tend to contribute more equally than those in other regons; while Germany leads the pack with $92 billion spent (5.7% of global), France and the UK aren't far behind, spending $52 billion and $44 billion respectively. Russia isn't counted as part of Europe for purposes of this report, but if they were, they'd be next in the list at $40 billion.

#HOW IS IT CHANGING?

Very well, thank you.

Okay, for real, let's break it down:

#...globally?
**THE R&amp;D TRAIN STOPS FOR NOTHING.**

Global R&amp;D spending is growing. It grew more slowly during the \~Great Recession\~, but it's pretty much always going to grow. That's not really surprising, of course; growing populations mean more people and more money, which means More Stuff.

#...in Asia?
**THE R&amp;D TRAIN IS A BULLET TRAIN.**

R&amp;D spending is growing most quickly in Asia. Developing countries have a lot of room to grow, and catching up can be done more quickly. Asia's probably going to keep growing more quickly than anyone else for a while. For the past two decades, Chinese R&amp;D spending has increased by 12-20% yearly, whereas US spending increased at around half that rate.

#...in Europe?
**THE R&amp;D TRAIN HAS QUALITY, EVEN THOUGH IT'S A LITTLE SMALL.**

European R&amp;D spending has been stagnant for a few years, but was expected to (and probably did) grow in 2014. The EU helps prevent research balkanization from hitting Europe too hard; cooperation among public research groups happens on fairly large scales.

The US and Europe are remarkably similar in terms of R&amp;D spending. They spend around the same proportions on basic research, applied research, and development, have highly-performing academic research institutions, and generally maintain high standards of quality.

#...in the US?
**THE R&amp;D TRAIN IS WAY TOO BIG TO STOP.**

Most US R&amp;D spending comes from private companies, which probably isn't surprising to anyone. That does mean that US R&amp;D spending tends to correlate with the strength of the American economy, which bodes fairly well for them.

For now, the US is still king of many metrics. They have the lion's share of strong research universities (almost 75% of the top ten and more than half of the top 50), for example, and they... well, they're big in general. Like, really big. The total share of American R&amp;D spending is going to keep decreasing as developing countries 

#What does it all MEAN?

Everyone's doing more R&amp;D. Remember that having more total R&amp;D spending doesn't mean that a country invents better stuff or anything like that. Most European countries, Japan, and the US are well-established and produce high-quality bleeding edge R&amp;D. Asian countries have spent a lot of time catching up, but they don't have *that* far to go. Top spenders in Europe are top spenders globally, but they're dwarfed by the biggest three.

Here are some things you can type about maybe:

- What's your country's strong suit? What can you and/or it bring to the table in terms of research? What do you think is the best course of action for your country to take in order to allow you to make snide polandball comics mocking how backwards your neighbors are?

- What can Europe as a whole do, if Europe as a whole *should* do anything? Getting all [blanda upp](https://i.imgur.com/317e4xW.jpg) isn't really feasible for now, but federalization isn't necessary for joint R&amp;D projects and the EU has shown that it can do those pretty well. It's probably a good idea to ensure that Europe doesn't lag behind the rest of the world here. Maybe you have thoughts? Focus on increasing cooperation with the US? Find a nice beach, sit back, and enjoy the economic benefits of a developing China?

Last but not least, remember that this isn't a race. Research is not a zero-sum game. Your country is not worse than another country because it doesn't spend as much on things (and vice versa), unless you're comparing it to America, in which case I as an American am legally obligated to inform you that we're better than you are. Well, if I can manage to type and hold my burgers at the same time.

Long story short. I moved cities last January and cancelled my Gym membership. Apparently I was 1 day late with cancellation letter, so I had to stay subscribed until September 2014. I didn't initially agree with this, but figured I'd pay anyway and that would be the end of it - at the end of the day aren't we all just looking for a quiet life?

Two days ago, I got a letter from the Gym I was in saying I am due to pay my subscription until September 2015 - 16 months after I had left the city I was in and sent 2 cancellation letters. I tried numerous times to call and discuss the issue, and was passed from pillar to post - until I was eventually told to like it or lump it.

I've really had enough of the way I was treated and have contacted a lawyer. He'll be contacting them on Monday. I don't want to seem petty, but I'm really annoyed at the way I've been treated and these people deserve to be thought a lesson - My question to you fine folk at r/germany is this:

If I rented a billboard outside this Gym for a month - what could I say without being in the wrong?

XXX Gym is Shit - don't go there

I had a terrible Experience with XXX Gym - macedandconfused

XXX Gym keep demanding money from me 16 months after I sent a cancellation letter

I've had a terrible experience with XXX Gym - I would recommend these alternatives yyy gym zzz gym

etc...

What do you think?

Today is day when fascist NDH was founded and on [Marshal TV](/r/europe/comments/2vy25y/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_15022015/coo7sjg) pioneers ""pointed"" on that with a report where butthurted people were crying about ""unused touristic capacites and branding of Kumrovec"".

So I would try to start a debate about another ""unused touristic attraction"" - [Ante Pavelic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ante_Pavelić) birtplace in Bradina, Herzegovina. 

Why limit the branding just on already built resources, why not expand the business and build some more ""memorial centers""?

Do we think in Europe only commie vampires are rich enough to travel to this part of the world? I don't think so, they are kind of on downward slope.

Thank you in advance to anyone who answers my question. 

I have an International Baccalaureate certificate (because I did not get the diploma because I didn't get a total of 12 in my HLs) and achieved the following results in my final exams: 

HL Physics: 3
HL ITGS: 3
HL Business Mgmt: 4
SL English A Lit: 4
SL Math: 4
AB initio Mandarin: 7

Those were terrible results but I have the following grades internally in my school transcript: 

HL physics: 5
HL ITGS:6
HL Business mgmt: 6
SL English A Lit: 5
SL Math: 4
AB Initio Mandarin: 7

I fucked up my final exams and so my official IB grades are the first mentioned and these right above are just on my internal transcripts. 

I want to know if I have any chance of getting into a German Uni, or even a Studienkolleg year. 

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

Mon titre n'est pas très clair. En gros je cherche une méthode pour corriger automatiquement des mots français qui n'ont pas d'accents mais qui devrait en avoir.
Par exemple dans mon dictionnaire j'ai ""repeter"" mais je veux le corriger pour ""répéter"".

Existe-t-il, à votre connaissance, des services Web (que l'on peut requêter de manière automatisé) pour faire ça ? 
Ou même juste un dictionnaire contenant l'intégralité de la langue française (il me suffirait alors de remplacer les accents par des ""e"", et de faire une comparaison)

Derrière il y aura sûrement des coquilles avec les participes passés ou autre à gérer mais ce n'est pas un problème, je cherche déjà un début de piste.

(si en plus de ça la méthode est utilisable avec du Ruby ou du Java ça serait idéal, mais je prends tout conseil évidemment)

Je suis pas sûr que ce soit le meilleur endroit pour poster ça, mais ça mais ça me parait plus pertinent que sur un sub de programmation anglophone.

Merci !

Angela set off with her sister Monika that Saturday morning and drove towards the border crossing at Oebisfelde. They had heard on the radio that morning that it was to be opened soon, but they didn’t think they could believe their ears. They passed the motorway junction and stopped on the edge of Wahrstedt, the last place before the border, where they looked up at the tall watch-tower. For the first time there were no soldiers there watching the people on the western side.

“Will we be allowed simply to drive through?” Monika asked Angela. “I don’t think so,” Angela answered, “the road has been blocked for years and the last hundred yards or so are full of potholes.”

Indeed they were unable to get more than a mile or so beyond Wahrstedt in the car, so they got out and continued on foot. There were already a lot of people there, curious to see what life had really been like over there. The first village beyond the border was run down and deserted, because nobody had been allowed to live there since the border fence had been built. 

However, Angela and Monika were surprised at the number of Trabants parked at the side of the roads, but they soon realised that all the East Germans from the area who had a car had themselves come to take advantage of the opening of the border and to go over to the West for the first time. 

“Will we understand them?” Monika asked. “Don’t be so silly,” Angela replied, “they  still speak German.”




Angela brach mit ihrer Schwester Monika am Samstag Morgen auf und fuhr in Richtung auf den Grenzübergang in Oebisfelde. Sie hatten am Morgen im Radio gehört, dass es bald eröffnet würde, aber sie glaubten nicht, dass sie ihren Ohren trauen konnte. Sie gingen das Autobahndreieck vorbei und hielten auf dem Rand von Wahrstedt an, der letzte Platz vor der Grenze, wo sie sahen zum hochen Wachtturm auf. Erstmalig gab es keine Soldaten dort, die Leute auf der westlichen Seite zu beobachten.

,,Werden wir einfach zu durchfahren tun dürfen?” Monika fragte Angela. 
,,Ich denke nicht” Angela antwortete, ,,Die Straße ist jahrelang aufgehalten worden und etwa die letzten hundert Yards sind voller Schlaglöcher.”

Tatsächlich könnten sie mehr als etwa eine Meile über Wahrstedt im Auto hinaus nicht kommen, also stiegen sie aus und den Weg zu Fuß fortsetzen. Es gab schon viele Leute da, neugierig zu sehen, was das Leben wirklich wie drüben gewesen war. Das erste Dort war über die Grenze hinaus heruntergekommen und unbewohnt, weil niemand da zu wohnen hatte gedurft, seitdem der Grenzzaun gebaut worden war. 

Jedoch waren Angela und Monika überrascht über die Anzahl der Trabanten, die an der Seite der Straße parkten, aber sie erkannten bald, dass alle Ostdeutschen vom Gebiet, die ein Auto hatten, selbst gekommen war, um den Vorteil der Öffnung der Grenze zu wahrnehmen und nach Westen zum ersten Mal zu hinübergehen.

Dovrò starci per parecchio tempo senza smartphone, pc..ecc ecc

La mia domanda è la seguente: avrò a disposizione 18 € a settimana per le sigarette ma essendo uno che si fuma un pacchetto e mezzo al giorno mi troverò in difficoltà a rientrare nel budget. Quindi ho pensato di usare questi soldi per comprare il tabacco sciolto in busta. Non avendo mai fumato prima tabacco sciolto non ho la più pallida idea di quale prendere.

Quindi vi chiedo quale secondo voi sarebbe la migliore soluzione come qualità/prezzo tenendo però conto che non mi piace quello umido e che sono abituato a fumare marlboro medium.

Grazie per l'attenzione,

Best Regards

Me and my friends are in Paris to visit Disney Land a few days. We're also going to Paris a day, to sightsee. 

Now coming monday we'll be leaving home to the Netherlands. We have to leave early because we have to check out, now the weather has been really nice. So we thought why not go swimming somewhere before we head home.

We would love to go to a tropical swimming paradise with a lot of action to do. is there anything you'd recommend? 
Ofcourse we can drive to it. We'd also prefer something more northern so it would be easy to go there on the way home.

If you have any advice just drop it here with perhaps a link to their site? Or maybe a short summary about it. Thank youuuu.

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,


ich habe von 12.03.2015 bis 18.03.2015 an einen einwochigen Urlaub in Ihrem Skiclub teilgenommen. Ich habe eine große Interesse Skifahren zu lernen deswegen meldte ich mich sofort an, nachdem ich Ihre Anzeige gelesen hatte. Mit meinem Urlaub war ich unzufrieden. Unterkunftsweise war das Zimmer zu klein und es gabe 8 Betten in jedem Zimmer. Man konnte auch kein Fernsehen schauen, weil es kaputt war. Das bad war ein Gemeinschaftsbad für 8 Personen und man musste viel warten bevor er es benutzen konnte. Zum Frühstück stand nur Toast und Marmalade zur Verfügung. Das Mittagsessen war auch eine Katastrophe. Es war immer kalt und zu wenig deshalb musste ich jeden Tag etwas von BurgerMeister kaufen. Zu meiner Überraschung war die Skischule während der ganzen Woche geschlossen. Ich kann selbst nicht Ski laufen, ich habe gedacht ich kann in die schule lernen danach kann ich mit dem Skilift fahren und auf dem Berg skilaufen, darum habe ich mich während meines Urlaubs nicht genossen statt nur mich geärgert. Aus diesen Gründen fordere ich eine Rückerstattung von 75% der Gebühren. Andernfalls werde ich einen Rechtsanwalt einschalten. Falls Sie Fragen haben, können Sie mir unter dieser Handynummer erreichen 0123456789.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen

It arrived yesterday, and the first time I switched it on, there was a line of dead pixels down the middle of the screen of the touchscreen. I've reset it a couple of times now and the problem won't go away.

I messaged the seller about the problem together with photos, we spoke on the phone &amp; he said it was working fine before. He's suggested I send it back to him, he would get it repaired under warranty (it's less than a year old) and send it back to me.  

Is it me, or is he being unreasonable?  I paid €230 for it, it was described ""as new"", it wasn't as described out of the box, and I don't see why I should have to wait possibly weeks for it to be repaired.  

At this point I just want my money back - the problem is in the description he wrote this is a private sale, returns not accepted. Is that the case when the item is not as described?

It's frustrating because I've bought and sold loads of stuff on eBay in the past and not had a problem like this before - and it's worse because my German isn't that great so I don't know what protections I have from eBay.

I'll be calling him back again today, I'm hoping he will accept it back but at this point he doesn't appear willing.

These villages have cheap houses, police patrols, school bus sevice, mobile post office, medical care, some kind of a bus service to nearby cities but these services don't stop the decline, people abandoning their villages and moving to cities for better jobs, leaving just empty villages behind. Some community try to create jobs (mainly agricultural jobs) but it doesn't solve the problem.
 
Do you have the same problem in your country or it's just a local problem in Hungary? Do you have any idea to stop the decline? Like an Euro Kibbutz Movement? Create holiday villages out of them?

A close firend of mine found a nice flat online in Hamburg. He will be staying in Hamburg for 5 months as an Erasmus student. It's a 1+1 flat, really close to center and full furnished. We are suspicious because the flat is really cheap. Rent is 260 euros. Bills will be paid by the landlord. He only has to pay 260 euros rent and 520 euros deposit. We contacted to the landlord via mail and he wrote: 

&gt;Danke für Ihr Interesse , Ich kaufte diese Wohnung für meinen Sohn während seines Studiums , aber jetzt ist er wieder zu Hause in Großbritannien dauerhaft, so dass ich die Vermietung der Ort für unbegrenzte Zeit. Bevor wir weiter gehen, möchte ich etwas über Sie wissen , wie zB wie viele Personen Sie beabsichtigen, in der Wohnung leben, was ist Ihre Aufgabe? Wie alt bist du? und für wie lange Sie bleiben? Die Wohnung ist genau wie auf den Bildern, voll möbliert ausgestattet und renoviert in diesem Jahr. Auch sehr wichtige, die Versorgungsunternehmen: Wasser, Strom, Heizung, Gas, Internet, TV-Kabel, Spülmaschine, Müllabfuhr, sind im Preis von 260 Euro pro Monat inklusive und ich glaube, es bequem für uns beide ist. Alle Rechnungen werden von mir bezahlt werden und Sie nur das Geld für die Miete im Monat zahlen. Die Kaution ist auch 520 €, und Sie bekommen es zurück wenn Sie sich entscheiden, die Wohnung zu verlassen ( Sie haben mir mindestens 1 Monat Kündigungsfrist z
u geben ). Sie können meine Möbel verwenden, oder Sie können auch Ihre eigenen verwenden, wenn Sie bevorzugen. Ich bin ein Neuro-Onkologie Arzt aus London - Großbritannien . Ich kann Vorkehrungen, um die Wohnung von hier aus schnell und einfach mieten machen . Ich freuen, bald von Ihnen zu hören.

and this:



&gt;First I have to tell you that the price you will pay for the first month of the rent will be 260 euros (money for the first month you move into my apartment), and I also ask security (deposit) 520 Euros, total you have to pay 780 euros, so you move to pay in my apartment at no extra cost.

&gt;I am ready to send you the keys, so to visit and check out the apartment .The handing over the keys and rental agreement (signed by me), will be made by Airbnb (www.airbnb.com), they are also us to help to a third party transaction to make it so that you can feel safe, therefore this deal.

&gt;The transaction must send with Airbnb, you give me all this information to start:

&gt;Full Name:
&gt;Street Address:
&gt;City:
&gt;Zip Code:
&gt;Country:
&gt;Date you want to want to move in the apartment:


&gt;Now, let me tell you how to work the business:

&gt;After I get all this information, I can go to Airbnb office and start the transaction. When they have the keys and the real estate company on custody, they will give you an ASN, in which they say that they have the key and all documents.

&gt;If the delivery notification by Airbnb, you must go to your bank office and assigned a referral to Airbnb agent in Germany, with this transaction for the amount we agreed (780 euros). Part I inform you that your payment must be confirmed within 24 hours or early after the transaction was started.

&gt;After you make the payment, you will need to Airbnb send the payment confirmation by bank transfer, so they know that you have already made the payment. Airbnb is to verify the payment and, if it is all right to deliver the keys and rental agreement to you in 48 hours. Airbnb will send to your door an agent, and that person will come with you to the apartment to visit, to see that everything is in order. If you are satisfied with the apartment, you will sign the lease. However, if you are not satisfied with the apartment for some reason, the agent will give money back immediately, and I'm going to get my keys and documents back (I will write on the lease this condition, to ensure that you get your money back).

&gt;Also, if you have another house right now, and you do not move right away, we can make the deal, as I explained it now, and think it is just an inspection and make reservations until you move into a position there.

&gt;I'll pay for the services of the agency, so there is no cost to you.

&gt;I am waiting for your quick response, because there are others interested in the apartment, and I need to know if I expect to make a deal with you.

&gt;Thanks and have a nice day!&gt;


Is this how things work in Germany? This is his first time in Germany and we don't know about rents, renting process etc. Should we trust to landowner and set a deal with him? What do you think?

Thank you for your help.

It's a German speaking show which is about two lovers, Doris Schneider and Metin Öztürk, who have just moved in together with their completely different families (one is from Turkey the other from Germany), thus leading to funny situations. The entire show is based on lies, misunderstandings and secrets which makes it very funny. It's available on Youtube though some episodes have much weaker sound due to copyrights (IIRC) for few minutes.

From a learner's point of view (aka why you should watch it) - it features a lot of ""Umgangssprache"" (knutschen, klauen, Schlampe, Arschloch etc), sometimes there are even regionalisms (especially from Northern Germany, stuff like ""piefig""). The grammar of most of the dialogues is pretty straightforward, it isn't very complicated. Not strictly aimed for beginners, more for the intermediate imo. I am intermediate and can only understand about 85 % of the language but the context helps me a lot with the rest.

On top of that, I guarantee you'll have a laugh or two throughout the show.

Ciao, scusami per il mio italiano brutto. Ho dimenticato molto di parlare.  La mia famiglia è italiana-americana e a mia mamma mancano molto i plumcake di mulino bianco (quelli con e quelli senza le gocce di cioccolato). Voglio comprargliene uno o due per la festa della mamma (10 maggio). Sembra una cosa semplice però non riesco a trovare un sito sul web che invia questi agli Stati uniti.

""Viele Gedichte beschäftigen sich mit der Literatur, warum eigentlich?"" 


In der Literatur sind Symbolen, Metaphern, Vergleichungen, die sich mit der Natur beziehen, unvermeidbar.  Die starke Präzenz der naturlichen Welt in der Literatur findet keine absolute und allumfassende Erklärung, daher muss der Leser sich auf individuelle Autoren, Gedichte und Metaphern richten, um unterschiedliche Andeutungen zu entdecken. Obwohl es schwer ist, eine feste Definition zu bestimmen, können wir manche Gründe hervorheben, weshalb die Natur solche eine wichtige Rolle in der Literatur spielt. Ich möchte mich mit den Gedichten zwei Autoren beschäftigen, die uns eine genauere Definition des Warum und Weshalb der Natur im Gedicht annähern können. Ich werde zuerst Celan und sein Gedicht 'Psalm' analysieren. Zweitens I. Bachmanns und das Gedicht 'Ausfahrt'. Schließend werde ich die Motive und Ähnlichkeiten zwischen beiden erklären, damit eine Idee von den Gründen dieser Zusammensetzung des Gedicht hinsichtlich der Natur vorgestellt sein kann. 
Der Dichter Paul Celan wurde vor dem Zweiten Welt Krieg geboren, und gehörte einer jüdischen deutschsprachigen Minorität in was damals Romanien war. Er erlebte der Zweite Welt Krieg. Seine Familie blieb aber in Romanien trotz seines Beharren, vom Land wegzufluchten. Sie würden in Konzentrationslager sterben, kurz vor dem Ende des Kriegs.

My sister is studying in Finland and she decided to travel Europe by train. She bought a legit interrail ticket from the train station in Tampere. There are two of her friends who bought the tickets in Poland.

So, they were heading to Paris and controllers in the train seized their tickets by claiming they are fake. They cooperated and agreed to go to the police because they bought all the tickets from official places. But the controllers didn't want to and put them in a really difficult position.

Now they don't have tickets, they don't have money for the train/plane and stuck in Paris. So, redditors of France, what are her options?

I understood the majority of it, but there is one line which has left me really confused. 


* In  [komm gib mir deine hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4NLqkv-J4k), there is the following phrase...

&gt;In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh

&gt;Das war noch nie bei einer anderen 

&gt;einmal so, einmal so, einmal so
 
Now, I understand all this apart from the 'einmal so.' I took this to be either even so, or something to do with firstly, but [this](http://german.about.com/library/blmus_beatles02e.htm) translations seems to say that it is a sort of reinforcement of the phrase 'Das war noch nie bei einer anderen.' I just do not understand this at all.


* Second song is ['zum ersten mal seit ewigkeiten'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LtQvCp3MGA) from Die Eiskönigin (frozen). If you listen at [2:00](https://youtu.be/4LtQvCp3MGA?t=2m), the lyrics below say 'Ja ich weiß, es hört sich verrückt an.'  I do not understand the need for 'sich' in this sentence. Although I am only a beginner, but I take that 'sich' to be referring to the 'es' which therefore means that it is sounding crazy to itself? From the context I know that it is referring to 'you' as the listener but still, I am confused as to the need for this sich here.

Here it is: we had been to the beach and after taking divers baths she started to feel the need to pee, but she didn't want to do it in the water neither in the public restrooms (she hates them) and she waited until returning home. In the way back she was suffering and at a certain point we found the traffic jam; she felt disperate and (I don't know how she did) she started to surreptitiously pee, right in my car! I have to specify I've never ""surreptitiuosly peed"" as she said, but she explained me she perfectly controlled the stream by letting it out step by step while being in a particular position and wearing a wet bikini, so she didn't wet my car neither and she didn't get wet so much since she was wearing a long estival dress. Totally professional! I didn't notice anything, but the question is: should I break up with her?

C'était il y a a peu pres 10 ans, et c'était une chanson assez connue a lépoque, la vidéo circulait partout sur internet.

J'avais vu la clip musique a la télé et sur YouTube plusieurs fois. C'était une animation 2D dessiné, et dedans il y avait une petite fille qui jouait dans la forêt, elle roulait dans l'herbe, etc... Au début on pense que c'est une vrai forêt, mais de temps en temps on percoit des caméras de securité dans les arbres qui observent la fille, puis on voit une biche qui n'est qu'une image imprimé sur du carton.

A la fin on voit que toute la forêt n'est qu'un plateau de tournage dans un studio, et que quand la fille a fini de jouer, il y a un autre enfant, ou toute une queu d'enfants, qui attendent de jouer dedans a leur tour.

En gros je cherche la vidéo par ce que je veux la montrer a quelqu'un, mais c'est frustrant de trouver quelque chose sur internet sans aucun mot-clef.

Ich habe schon in 2012 ein Praktikum bei Telekom gemacht und viele über Kommunikationstechnologie dort gelernt. Meine Abschlussarbeit schreibe ich über W-Lan Netzwerken und ihre Benutzung in der Praxis. Deshalb möchte ich gern bei Ihnen die neue Technologie der W-Lan Netzwerken lernen.

Für deutsche Technologie bzw. deutsche Sprache habe ich mich immer interessiert, darum möchte ich in Deutschland ein Praktikum machen. Ich habe schon Deutsch als Fremdsprache an der Goethe Institute in Kopenhagen gelernt und die Goethe-Zertifikat B2 bekommen. Über eine positive Antwort von Ihnen würde ich mich sehr freuen.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen

This source from PWC claims that someone with no children pays on average 39.9% tax. That is fair enough, I know that is roughly what the German tax rate is. But later on in the article it says that someone married with two children will pay only 21.3%. 

Could anyone verify this figure? Is it true? I didn't know that there were such massive financial benefits to having children. Is there anywhere that I can see the exact figures and how having children affects the income tax rate that you pay? Whenever I check a tax calculator it doesn't seem to concur with this, but maybe it is something new?

I'll be visiting France in September with my (soon to be) husband for our honeymoon. I wanted to ask your opinion of the route we're thinking of driving in the Normandy countryside.

We're thinking of renting a car on the outskirts of Paris, and driving to Vernon/Giverny. Spend the day in the area, Monet's house and garden, spend the night in the Vernon area.

The next day, drive out to Rouen, stop for a late breakfast/early lunch and see the cathedral. Get back on the road and head to Etretat on the coast. Spend the rest of the day there around the beach, spending the night in the area.

The next day, drive to Honfleur for lunch. Walk around a bit, then drive to Bayeux to see the tapestry before the museum closes for the night. If we miss it, catch it in a the morning before we leave town. Spend the night in Bayeux.

Next day, drive to Mt St Michel and spend the day exploring. Spend the night near the island.

Here's the big driving day - leave that morning nice and early from Mt St Michel and return to Paris before it gets dark.

Thoughts? Are we crazy, or do you think it's doable?

I need to do some research on how the German alphabet is taught to German children. I'm doing a project for school. 

Some things I need to understand better... 

When I looked up the letters of the alphabet, sites say there are only 26 letters. Then äöü and ß are considered ""special characters"". So if a German child were reciting the alphabet, would they ignore the special characters and just say the first 26 letters? Then how would they learn äöü and ß? Do these letters have their own names or would you call it ""an A with an umlaut"" in German. Or are they included in alphabet songs? This has me so confused. 

Are there any popular German alphabet songs, videos or books/PDFs I could look into? 

Thank you

**Rules:**

-I'm not looking for anything *stereotypical* to represent the country culturally, just an enjoyable song by an artist from your country! Feel free to choose those kinds of songs if you like however!

-The Artist has to be from or live in the country.

-The song *does not* have to be in the language of the country but it can be.

-The song can be any genre, traditional or contemporary. You can pick it for any reason, whether it's a song you really enjoy or a song that really represents the country culturally (ie: It can be a Romanian rap song or a traditional South African folk song etc...)

-Feel free to recommend songs that you have heard or know of from other countries!

-Links are appreciated!

***Examples of songs/genres I have added so far:***

[Germany - Modern Pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYNLQjrBVPo)

[Trinidad - Caribbean Soca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRsfFisqfuc)

[Norway - 80's SynthPop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djV11Xbc914)

[Mexico - Classical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkVcwrL1hog)

[Russia - Hip-Hop/Alternative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06ATS_XC_CI)

[India - Traditional/Emotional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDn2bn7_YSM)

You can see there is a wide variety and I'm not looking for one specific thing, just a song that I enjoy! Thanks for your input in advance and enjoy the musical discussion!
