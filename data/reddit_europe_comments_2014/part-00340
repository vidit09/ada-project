-----quoted after here from 
http://www.ttip2014.eu/blog-detail/blog/Transport%20Environment%20ISDS%20TTIP.html -----

For clarity’s sake, here’s our top-10 reasons why excluding ISDS from TTIP is the only right way forward.

 - ISDS introduces the ‘fright to regulate’ which is bad for people and the planet. The all-encompassing result of the flaws of the ISDS system – outlined further below - is that governments will feel a sword of Damocles hanging over their heads when they plan public-interest regulations on companies. The European Commission’s argument that nothing in ISDS affects the ‘right to regulate’ is beside the point. The threat of a costly legal dispute with a very uncertain outcome will act as a deterrent for many governments to protect citizens or the environment.
 - ISDS uses citizens’ money to bail out corporations for risky investments: In total TTIP would enable 75,000 companies to seek damages from EU and US governments (hence citizens, through taxes).[4] Although ISDS became a regular feature of investment treaties in the 1960s, claims have ballooned over the past decade: 57 known new cases were launched in 2013 alone.
 - ISDS grants special rights to foreign investors over everybody else. Only foreign investors can use ISDS panels; domestic ones, let alone normal citizens, have to keep using the regular legal system.
 - ISDS upsets legal systems, introducing arbitration on legislation. Dispute settlement systems in normal treaties seek to resolve conflicts directly related to the treaty. ISDS, in contrast, allows companies to sue government for any legislation they deem unfair or inequitable that is developed after the treaty; effectively introducing arbitration on legislation. ISDS does not even require ‘exhaustion of local remedies’ – further undermining democracy and the rule of law. ISDS is not intended as a last resort should all other legal routes fail; it is explicitly designed to take place outside the normal legal systems.
 - ISDS is not bound to legal precedent, ignoring the ABC of international law and introducing further uncertainty: The lack of case law in ISDS has led to inconsistent arbitral decisions with different legal interpretations of identical or similar treaty provisions, further increasing uncertainty and fear referred to in point 1.
 - ISDS is the only international dispute settlement giving rights to corporations instead of states: Dispute settlement procedures in other international treaties are state-state - even the World Trade Organisation dispute settlement is state-state.
 - EU-level ISDS has never been impact-assessed:  ISDS is a new EU level policy that can result in billions of euros flowing from EU citizens to foreign corporations in the future. Despite this, the European Commission has not bothered to prepare an impact assessment on it, in dire contradiction with its own guidelines,[5] and just started to insert it in trade agreements it started to negotiate after the Lisbon treaty.
 - ISDS proceedings take place out of the public eye: ISDS cases are held behind closed doors and are fully confidential, even if cases being disputed involve matters of public interest.
 - ISDS is unnecessary. Even almost without ISDS, the EU and US already trade gargantuan volumes: Both blocs barter around €1.6 billion ($2.2 billion)[6] in goods and services every day, with more than €2.6 trillion ($3.5 trillion) in two-way direct investment per year[7] – all this with only one-third of EU countries (or 7% of EU’s GDP) covered by ISDS. Apparently investors already place significant trust in the regular legal systems.
 - Better alternatives exist: whereas ISDS is a subsidy, from the public purse, for activities at risk from tighter regulations, risk insurance is offered by a host of private providers but also for example by the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (a division of the World Bank) and others.[8]

These 10 flaws are so intrinsic to the very system of ISDS that a reform – as proposed by the European Commission – simply cannot address them.

Europe needs to follow the lead of countries like Australia, Brazil and India, and ditch ISDS instead of imposing it to the 93% of the EU economy that has so far deemed it unnecessary.

false,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"&gt;Ireland bailed out their banks but was prevented from burning senior bank bondholders by the ECB to avoid loss of confidence in Eurozone banking system.

True, but the amount involved was only about 10% of our bailout. People often forget that most of the bank bailout happened during the guarantee, before the ECB's intervention. It also seems to me that the *only* time the Irish government ever suggested burning bondholders was when they might have got the ECB to take the blame for it, and when non-market funding for Ireland was assured.

&gt;The initial loan rates were 6% - twice what the troika paid - as a punishment and deterrent to others. This was later reduced to market rates.

They were, but we never paid the high rates. When the EU parts of the bailout were reduced to well below market rates (market rates for Ireland, that is), the change was also retrospective. The IMF loans (and the bilaterals from the UK) remain at the original higher rates.

&gt;However the initial problem was caused by stupid Irish Government policy pandering to their electorate.

And pandering to Irish-based banks. The bank regulator was chosen deliberately for his lack of forcefulness, banks regularly wrote legislation that the Ministers for Finance passed verbatim, the IFSC Steering Group met (and still meets) in the Department of the Taoiseach, chaired by a very senior civil servant.

But yeah, the combination of boosting every welfare &amp; pensioner payment going with benchmarking the civil service bought FF three big voting constituencies - ones that encompass probably every family in the country. All paid for with what were actually windfall taxes from the property bubble.

You know what a ""banana republic"" is, specifically? It's a country where there's a main export crop or natural resource, and when the market price of that jumps, the government splashes out on swelling the civil service payroll and huge vanity building projects, ignoring the fact that when the price drops again there won't be the money to keep paying the civil servants or maintaining the white elephants - generally leading to political instability.

Friend1 says: I could have totally been a good baseball player. Ich hätte ein...können

At what point does Friend2 understand the können/could is coming? In English ""could have"" are lumped together, but German throws the ""could"" part of that to the end. How does Friend2 follow what Friend1 is saying at all until the very last word?

Friend1:Ich hätte mit euch wandern gehen...

The Euro is a project that is incomplete. The sovereign debt crisis and the massive hair-cuts to banks (Cyprus in particular) highlighted the weakness of the existing structure.

The Banking Union that is being negotiated should fix those weaknesses, as the Single Supervisor would witness risk build-up in systemically important banks and act to enforce stronger capital requirements. Then, with the creation of a Single Resolution Mechanism, many banks would be shielded from having to take such large losses as they could be directly recapitalised with funds from the European Stability Mechanism. This should give banks accross the EU less challenging credit conditions and therefore increase the capacity for crisis countries to grow.

Anekdote zur Senkung der Arbeitsmoral zielt genau **auf** die Probleme unsere**r**^^genitiv Zeit – dass wir alle wirklich hart arbeiten müssen, um so erfolgreich wie möglich zu werden. Die Geschichte betont, dass die Mehrheit der Bevölkerung glaub~~en~~**e**, ^^konjunktiv, ^^indirect ^^speech, ^^singular, ^^belongs ^^to ^^'Mehrheit' wir könn**t**en nicht diese~~r~~**m**^^dativ Erfolgskurs ~~glücklicherweise~~ folgen,

* *'glücklicherweise' means something different, it does not fit here. I can't think of a fitting adjective that doesn't sound ridiculously pretentious, we need to paraphrase. Suggestion:*

Die Geschichte betont, dass die Mehrheit der Bevölkerung glaube, wir könnten nicht diesem Erfolgskurs folgen und dabei glücklich bleiben,

 noch **könnten wir uns** während des Kurses ~~uns~~ entspannen, sondern eher danach**,** nach viel Arbeit und Erfolg**,** “~~dösen~~ am Hafen **dösen**.” Ich glaube, das**s** diese Ansicht^^better: ^^'Auffassung' von ~~der~~ Fröhlichkeit^^better: ^^'Glück' und Erfolg fehlgeleitet ist und dass man ~~kann~~ ein erfüllendes^^better: ^^'erfülltes' Leben anders~~wie~~^^'anderswie' ^^is ^^slang leben^^better: ^^'führen' **kann**. Ich begrüße Bölls Darstellung ~~von~~ dieser Probleme, aber ich denke, **dass der Fischer alles nicht völlig in Ordnung hat.**
 
* *Makes no sense this way, needs rephrasing. Suggestion:*

dass der Fischer nicht vollkommen Recht hat.

Ich denke, dass ein~~en~~ ~~Mittlegrund~~ **Mittelweg** zwischen de~~r~~**n** Philosophien des Fischers und des Tourist~~s~~**en** gefunden werden kann. Man kann hart arbeiten und ~~davon~~ **so** Erfolg haben, glaube ich, **aber bestimmen über einen Bereich, der man nie mühsam finden wird.** *I don't get this bit at all*

Wegen seiner literarischer Fähigkeit *(which english word did you translate to 'Fähigkeit'? Makes no sense here. Fähigkeit = ability)* habe ich Anekdote zur Senkung der Arbeitsmoral auch **~~entschieden~~ ausgewählt**. Seine Beschreibungen haben ~~sich~~ so (needs an adjektive here, suggestion: 'stark') auf mich ~~aus~~gewirkt, dass ich **mich an** seine~~r~~ Geschichte mehr als die andere, die wir gelesen haben, **erinnert** habe. De~~r~~**n**^^akkusativ Hafen kann ich **mir** noch immer abbilden^^better: ^^'vorstellen ^^*or* ^^ausmalen, weil er so schön beschrieben wurde: “**B**lauer Himmel, grüne See mit friedlichen**,** schneeweißen Wellenkämmen, schwarzes Boot, rote Fischermütze“ (Z. 4-5). Böll benutzt das Symbol ~~von~~ der Zigarette, um die Ähnlichkeiten zwischen de~~n~~**m**^^dativ Fischer und de~~n~~**m**^^dativ Tourist**en** zu zeigen, obwohl sie total anders^^better: ^^'verschieden' sind, und um diese Unterschiede größer ~~zu~~ erscheinen **zu lassen**: „,,Rauchen Sie eine von meinen?""

Die Spannung verwendet Böll auch, als der Tourist de~~n~~**m**^^dativ Fischer viele Frage**n** stellt und ~~nichts wieder~~ **keine Antwort** bekommt, um zu zeigen, dass der Fischer ~~rühige~~ **ruhig** und einfach~~e~~ lebt. Deswegen ~~spricht~~ **sagt** der Fischer **Dinge** wie: „Ich fühle mich phantastisch”.^^today ^^we ^^spell ^^it ^^'fantastisch' ^^but ^^Brecht ^^probably ^^still ^^used ^^'ph'

Diese Geschichte hat mir **auch** wegen des Humor**s** und der Charakterisierung ~~auch~~ gefallen. Die Wiederholung der Phrase**n** “Der Fischer schüttelt den Kopf” oder “Kopfnicken des Fischers” habe ich lustig gefunden, und **sie**^^*die ^^Wiederholung* hat de~~r~~**n**^^akkusativ Fischer **als** bequem und witzig gemalt^^better: ^^'gezeichnet' ^^*or ^^best:* ^^'dargestellt'. Das ~~ist~~ **wurde** am Ende der Geschichte gezeigt, als er “Aber das tu ich ja schon jetzt” sagte.

Die Moral dieser Geschichte, wie ich es sehe, ~~geht~~ **folgt** genau ~~mit~~ der Lebensweisheit und wichtige~~r~~**n** Frage – soll der Mensch arbeiten um zu leben, oder leben um zu arbeiten? Ich glaube, Böll hat gezeigt, dass ~~der~~ **die** Arbeit nicht das Leben bestimmen soll, noch **soll sie** das Leben übernehmen. Man soll nicht die Mehrheit des Lebens warten, um **sich** am Ende ~~zu~~ endlich^^redundant ~~sich~~ **zu** entspannen. Ich denke, diese Geschichte kann für unsere Gesellschaft **gelten werden,** *either* 'für unsere Gesellschaft gelten' *or* 'für unsere Gesellschaft gültig werden'

 weil wir alle unterrichtet^^better: ^^'gelehrt' werden, dass wir hart arbeiten ~~muss~~ **müssen**,^^1st ^^pers, ^^plural um erfolgreich zu sein. Vielleicht haben wir vergessen, dass wir **nicht** alle selbstverständlich ~~nicht~~ erfolgreich werden können. Ich habe es wirklich anwendbar gefunden, weil ich denke, meine Familie denkt manchmal genau wie der Tourist, und soll**te**^^konjunktiv ^^II das Leben mehr genießen. ~~Der~~ **Die** Welt könnte viel von dieser Geschichte lernen, **und hoffentlich sich von der Philosophie des Tourists fernhalten.** *This does not work. Should be rephrased. Suggestion:* und sich, so ist meine Hoffnung *or* so hoffe ich, von der Philosophie des Touristen entfernen.

Data la tua grande esperienza nel campo dell'informatica volevo porti alcune domande riguardo:
&gt;mi iscrissi in una facoltà di indirizzo informatico, Ingegneria Informatica, con tanti sogni, progetti ambizioni...

Prima delle domande però volevo illustrati la mia situazione: 
Sono un ragazzo di 19 anni sempre stato appassionato dall'informatica.
Alle superiori ho frequentato un istituto tecnico  tecnologico con indirizzo informatico. Qui ho imparato moltissime cose riguardanti l'informatica, tanto che a 17 anni ho lavorato prima per un'azienda italiana (creando un'applicazione che sfruttava il kinect ) e successivamente ho svolto uno stage in una start up informatica a Liverpool (della durata di circa 5 settimane).
Quindi diciamo che un minimo di esperienza me la sono fatta, e rispetto a molti altri ragazzi della mia età posso vantare 2 buone esperienze lavorative.

Devo dire però che durante queste prime due esperienze ho nutrito un profondo rifiuto nel programmare e nel stare ore su ore davanti ad un PC. D'altro canto però le mie conoscenze in questo campo sono molto buone e ho anche una certa dimestichezza

L'anno scorso indeciso sul cosa fare ho scelto ingegneria informatica a Milano perché pensavo(non sono sicuro di pensarlo ancora) che mi aprisse varie opportunità nel campo del lavoro dato il vario ventaglio di argomenti da affrontare nel piano di studio (fisica, eletrotecnica , elettronica ...). 
Mosso dalla curiosità ho cominciato a guardare i vari annunci di lavoro per ingegneri informatici e devo dire che sono stato profondamente deluso. Tutti offrono lavori per programmatori cosa che non mi andrebbe per niente a genio.

Sto cominciando ad avere delle crisi dato che non so cosa fare. Fortunatamente sono al primo anno quindi avrei tutto il tempo per cambiare facoltà(dato che gli esami principali di ingegneria sono quasi uguali per tutti )
Dopo questa lunga divagazione  volevo chiedere a persone molto esperte nel settore:

*secondo voi quali possono essere i lavori per un ingegnere informatico oltre a puro programmatore

*se dovessi cambiare facoltà quale mi consigliereste( che abbiano un buon sbocco lavorativo )

Fatemi sapere e fatemi pure domande se non vi è chiaro qualcosa( ho scritto in maniera frettolosa )

&gt;

&gt;__Survivorship bias__, or __survival bias__, is the [logical error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_error) of concentrating on the people or things that ""survived"" some process and inadvertently overlooking those that did not because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to false conclusions in several different ways. The survivors may be actual people, as in a medical study, or could be companies or research subjects or applicants for a job, or anything that must make it past some selection process to be considered further.

&gt;Survivorship bias can lead to overly optimistic beliefs because failures are ignored, such as when companies that no longer exist are excluded from analyses of financial performance. It can also lead to the false belief that the successes in a group have some special property, rather than just coincidence. For example, if the three of the five students with the best college grades went to the same high school, that can lead one to believe that the high school must offer an excellent education. This could be true, but the question cannot be answered without looking at the grades of all the other students from that high school, not just the ones who ""survived"" the top-five selection process.

&gt;Survivorship bias is a type of [selection bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias).

Ca, c'est le problème number one. Un Etat palestinien OK, mais un Etat gouverné par le Hamas non. L'Autorité de Mahmoud Abbas pourrait être un meilleur point de départ, mais ils sont complètement décrédibilisés auprès de la rue palestinienne.

&gt; Je vois plus ces territoires être intégrés aux pays voisins (Gaza à l'Égypte et la Cisjordanie à la Jordanie).

J'y crois pas trop malheureusement... Ca a déjà été fait. L'Egypte à occupé Gaza de 1959 à 1967, la Jordanie à occupé la Cisjordanie de 1948 à 1967. Les deux territoires ont été repris par Israël lors de la guerre des Six Jours (qui reste un des moments les plus *holy shit awesome!* de l'histoire du Moyen-Orient).

J'ai bien dit ""occupé"" et pas ""administré"". L'Egypte a installé un gouverneur militaire et traitait les Palestiniens comme des apatrides qui n'avaient pas le droit de sortir de leur territoire. Depuis la fin de la guerre des Six Jours, les Egyptiens ont abandonné le Sinaï, même quand Israël l'a rendu au contrôle du Caire, et c'est maintenant une zone de non-droit livrée aux bédouins qu'il faudrait ""recoloniser"" si on devait intégrer Gaza à l'Egypte correctement.

La Jordanie a fait un peu mieux, en accordant la citoyenneté jordanienne aux Palestiniens de Cisjordanie, mais en les parquant dans des camps de réfugiés. Il y a même maintenant une grosse minorité de Jordaniens d'origine palestinienne, qui ont d'ailleurs formé une sorte d'Etat dans l'Etat refusant l'autorité de la monarchie d'Amman jusqu'en 1970 où ils ont essayé d'assassiner le roi et ont déclenché une guerre civile (qu'on appelle Septembre Noir maintenant) qui s'est soldée en massacre. Selon les estimations, entre 3500 et 15000 Palestiniens ont été tués par l'armée jordanienne.

To give you at least a little bit of an answer: Apart from Clubsounds like Robin Shulz, Kalkbrenner or Milky Chance (i know they are technically not Clubsounds) there is Trend for Singer/Songwriter Style in german Music at the Moment. Andreas Bourani, Adel Tawil, Mark Forster and so on. 
A few german Hiphop Acts like Sido also pop up every now and then.
And you can always count on the ""classic"" Band like ""die Ärzte"" and ""Die Toten Hosen"" to land in the top 10 when they release something new. ""Farin Urlaub Racing Team"" just released a new Album, its not as strong as then previous but still managed to top the album charts for a short while.

false,ur-nammu,CROA,Mexico,"&gt;The SFR Yugoslavia was a conglomeration of eight federated entities, roughly divided along ethnic lines, including six republics—Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia—and two autonomous provinces within Serbia, Vojvodina and Kosovo.

&gt;With the 1974 Constitution, the office of President of Yugoslavia was replaced with the Yugoslav Presidency, an eight-member collective head-of-state composed of representatives from six republics and, controversially, two autonomous provinces of the Socialist Republic of Serbia, SAP Kosovo and SAP Vojvodina.

&gt;Since the SFR Yugoslav federation was formed in 1945, the constituent Socialist Republic of Serbia (SR Serbia) included the two autonomous provinces of SAP Kosovo and SAP Vojvodina. With the 1974 constitution, the influence of the central government of SR Serbia over the provinces was greatly reduced, which gave them long-sought autonomy. The government of SR Serbia was restricted in making and carrying out decisions that would apply to the provinces. The provinces had a vote in the Yugoslav Presidency, which was not always cast in favor of SR Serbia. In Serbia, there was great resentment towards these developments, which the nationalist elements of the public saw as the ""division of Serbia"". The 1974 constitution not only exacerbated Serbian fears of a ""weak Serbia, for a strong Yugoslavia"" but also hit at the heart of Serbian national sentiment. A majority of Serbs see Kosovo as the ""cradle of the nation"", and would not accept the possibility of losing it to the majority Albanian population.

&gt;In an effort to ensure his legacy, Tito's 1974 constitution established a system of year-long presidencies, on a rotation basis out of the eight leaders of the republics. Tito's death would show that such short terms were highly ineffective. Essentially it left a power vacuum which was left open for most of the 1980s.

Livraison DHL nickel (le livreur était même prêt à venir me le déposer au bureau s'il n'y avait personne chez moi, dans la même journée, donc trajet de banlieue vers Paris plutôt conséquent), et ils ont probablement épuisé leur stock de papier à bulles en m'emballant le tout.

Her response should be either to apologize, say, ""You're quite right, well spotted"" and correct her mistake; or to explain in terms that you can easily follow exactly why, contrary to what you'd previously thought, her version is correct. One of those two things. If she gets upset or offended, she's not the right teacher for you.

We all make mistakes from time to time, usually because there are so many things we have to be thinking about at any given time, our brains lose track of what we're supposed to be doing. I have been known to say to students: ""Oh, I made a mistake -- can anyone see what it is?""

&gt; He said she made a grammatical error (used the wrong case) in his first sentence to him. 

Not knowing the specifics, I can't comment. But sometimes cases in German are not as clear-cut as the text-books would like you to believe. The most obvious example is the genitive case, which is slowly being replaced by constructions that use the dative. Textbooks will tell you that prepositions like ""wegen"" take the genitive case (""wegen des Wetters...""), which is correct *formal* German, but in normal, everyday speech Germans are more likely to use the dative (""wegen dem Wetter...""). A teacher may well say, for example, ""wegen dir"" when talking normally, but in class teach you ""deinetwegen"". She may be speaking dialect (for example, Berliners will say ""dir"" where you'd expect ""dich""), but that doesn't necessarily mean she is *teaching* you dialect.

Of course, it also depends on why you're learning German. If it's to talk to your boyfriend, or to live in Germany and be able to do all the things a German needs to do, your German doesn't need to be perfect and you can tolerate a few quirks. If, on the other hand, you're studying for an exam or hoping for a job as a journalist, you'd need a teacher with the appropriate qualifications and, if possible, experience in the field.",0,1415870433,null,0,false,0,cm18myy,t3_2m5y37,t1_cm18myy,t3_2m5y37,null,1426048280,10,false,German,t5_2qq51,10

Ich hoffe ja immer, dass solche Aktionen das Ende des Netzfeminazitums einleiten. Schon damals bei AtheismPlus erlebten die ja eine Kernschmelze, aber irgendwie hielt die das nicht davon ab das auch noch mal bei Videospielen zu probieren. 

Interessant war im Rahmen von dieser Aktion allerdings, wie weit die Feminazis die Spielejournalisten unterwandert hatten. Da wurde -ganz feministisch- Sex für gute Bewertungen, Sex für Jubelartikel, Sex für hohe Positionen bei Entwicklern ausgegeben. Jeder durfte mal, Hauptsache es nutzte der eigenen Sache. 

Als das rauskam wurden die Netzwerke aktiv und zensierten massiv. Selbst reddit und 4chan, die sich immer einen Hort der Meinungsfreiheit nennen, sprangen auf Befehl der Feminazis an und versuchten das zu begraben. Schadensmaximierung wenn man so will, das selbe machten ja auch die Natoversteher unter den Journalisten durch, die ganze Foren schlossen um die Wahrheit zu unterdrücken und nur offenbarten, dass sie keine Ahnung haben wie das Internet funktioniert. Massive Einbrüche bei den Nutzerzahlen waren die Folge. 

Das selbe gilt ja auch bei den Spielewebseiten. Letzens sollen sogar große Sponsoren wie Intel und Mercedes abgesprungen sein.

Ich bin ja der Meinung das selbe Problem haben die Medien im Allgemeinen. Völlig unterwandert liest man ständig Schund in den großen Zeitungen bezgl. dieses Themas. Wäre schön wenn sich der Haufen Spieler auch dort mal auf den Weg macht und zu den Journalisten recherchiert.

Par contre, a aucun moment, il n'est remis en cause l'inconfort d'avoir une voix unique pour 4 actrice: Déborah Perret is the French Jennifer Lopez (1), Salma Hayek (2), Holly Hunter (3), and Kate Blanchett (4)
Nathalie Karsenti, [...] is the French January Jones (1), Keira Knightley (2), Eva Mendes (3), and Zoe Saldana (4).
Et pour ce qui est de Patrick Poivey, il est hors-competition.

Comme toujours, il faut le repeter: ""Le doublage a la francaise"" est une technique qui ne va pas disparaitre (l'auteur du reportage appel ca ""un art"" pour faire super-duper frenchy j'imagine), pas plus que la TV n'a tue ni le roman photo, ni le theatre. Il y aura toujours des oeuvres qui auront une valeur ajoute a etre doubler (reportage, documentaire, films d'annimation...), mais peut-etre que vouloir doubler 100% de la production US de films &amp; de Series TV, c'est une demarche absurde. Deja a son epoque, le doublage de Friends etait une catastrophe, et Internet n'etait vraiment pas en cause (en 1996).

Ce qui est fondamentalement mauvais dans ce reportage, c'est de mettre en avant une activite de star: les noms de voix de grands acteurs/actrices sont cite, mais il n'est jamais dit que Kelly Marot (la voix de J-Law) en ai reduit a faire les voix de dizaines d'autres actrices, generalement un peu moins populaire. De meme Kelly Marot est personna non-gratta pour une carriere TV/Film, car sa voix est desormais plus importantes que sa personne, mais ca n'empeche pas l'auteur d'ecrire: ""she will have steady work for as long as Jennifer Lawrence does"" Donc pour Kelly Marot, tu ne choisie pas ta vie, tu es juste un pion.

Ce qui est certain, c'est qu'une situation pareil ne sera pas tenable, economiquement, c'est une impasse: de plus en plus de production, de plus en plus d'acteurs, de plus en plus de voix, donc un cout de doublage en croissance forte. Les diffuseurs vont finir par s'etrangler.

Your wording shows you are already biased. It has nothing to do with xenophobia.**It's a law to protect cultural diversity, not to prevent it.**

In france we believe that culture is not like every other merchandise.

The law for instance forces TV networks to invest 3.2% of their income in movie production of French or **European** movies. 60% of TV screen time has to be **european** shows or movies. The law is made to protect diversity in front of the growing Americanization of the entertainment industry. Americans don't consume as much foreign movies/music (british doesn't count) than other European nations do (or used to do). It only goes one way. Therefore such laws had been voted to balance the phenomenon of American imported culture.

A tax on tickets help funds movies in France. Thanks to this law many movies can be produced and France is still one of the biggest movie makers in the world after the USA and India.

&gt;Between 2005 and 2011, between 45% and 55% of its film products were American imports, compared to 60 to 90% American imports in other European film markets

Many American majors have problem with this law as they rightfully feel they're being taxed to fund french movies. But at the same time these firms barely distribute foreign movies in the USA, and when a European movie is succesful, they remake it. So I don't really feel for them. 

Odds are that you have seen many movies partly produced by French tv, which has grown as a big player in the cinema industry, including british (Billy Eliott) and american ones (terminator 2).",0,1415871538,null,0,1415879062,0,cm18txv,t3_2m5xes,t1_cm18txv,t3_2m5xes,null,1426048191,15,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,15

Here are [some examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjmmxFYtkhI) of his speeches in court translated into English:  
  
Judge: Mr. Seselj, please stand up.

Seselj: I have published a book ""In the Jaws of the Hooker Del Ponte (former Chief Prosecutor)
  
Seselj: You, members of the Hague Tribunal can only accept to suck my dick.  
  
Seselj: Keep interrupting me and only thing you'll be able to do is to eat the shit that you just shitted. I fuck your mothers starting with the judges.  
  
While imprisoned he wrote a book ""Felon and War Criminal Javier Solana"".  
Vojislav Seselj is charged on 15 counts of crimes against humanity including crimes against Croats, Muslims and other non-Serbs in Vukovar, Šamac, Zvornik and Vojvodina; murder, forced deportation, illegal imprisonment, torture and property destruction during the Yugoslav wars.
  
He was released, however he told the court that he will not obey house arrest rules it issued. During his [return flight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-Bzvcfv5p0) he said he will continue his political career, bring back serbian radicals to government and get Serbia into union with Russia.

Small governments tend to be efficient. It's also what I would like to call bottom-up, it's a management term, but social discussions here start among society, when they grow big enough the government takes it up, and they actually listen to opinions, groups etc.

Big governments tend to function top-down, and not listen but push against society.

Finland, Denmark and Sweden are indeed roughly the same, they can very well be compared. In Finland they say ""Don't worry, your life is planned from uterus to the end"".

Everything is taken care of. Which is, I think, the reason we Always top the lists of ""most happy countries in the world"". The Netherlands has the ""most happy children in the world"" and I believe the rest of the population was somewhere around 4th place worldwide. 

Because whatever misery hits your life, there is Always a solution and you're never alone. You're practically insured for anything, so little worries. 

While at the same time we also top the world civic freedom index (Sweden is the most free country in the world I believe) and all countries mentioned are part of the top 10 best functioning countries in the world (Democracy index)

La mia personale esperienza non ti disilluda, se a te piace studiare quello che stai studiando, ti piacciono i programmi, i corsi, et cetera, non c'è alcun motivo per abbandonare. Ti posso assicurare che un ingegnere informatico può fare molto più di un ""semplice"" programmatore. 

Potrei elencarti una serie di lavori diversi dalla programmazione che puoi fare come informatico o ingegnere informatico, c'è il sistemista, l'analista, il project manager, il sysadmin... Le figure all'interno della produzione del software sono molte, ma la vera domanda che dovresti farti è: cosa ti piace fare esattamente? Se ad esempio ti piace la sicurezza informatica, anche quello è uno sbocco lavorativo. A me piacciono un sacco i database, ad esempio; essere esperto di database apre molti sbocchi lavorativi. Se ti piace il mondo dei videogame, anche qui ci sono una lunga serie di figure in base a propensioni e capacità individuali. Per le aziende medio-grandi e certe volte anche in quelle piccole esiste l'R&amp;D (ricerca e sviluppo), settore in cui gli informatici e gli ingegneri informatici sono richiestissimi. Ultimamente anche le aziende italiane hanno iniziato ad occuparsi di *Business intelligence*, un processo di raccolta dati e analisi degli stessi, anche questo è uno sbocco lavorativo, sebbene la figura sia ancora poco richiesta - anche perché, in Italia, molti non sanno neanche cosa sia. Poi ci sono i rami di robotica e Intelligenza Artificiale, che secondo me sono interessantissimi, c'è il ramo delle telecomunicazioni... Le vie come vedi sono tantissime e sicuramente ne sto anche omettendo tante altre. Però ti ripeto, devi chiederti cosa vuoi fare da grande, è giusto che tu dica voglio fare l'informatico ma non il programmatore, ma devi anche capire qual è la tua strada. 

Cambia facoltà se ti senti insoddisfatto, se non hai stimoli; buona parte degli ingegneri informatici, se cambiano, passa a informatica, perché il corso di laurea è *tendenzialmente* più semplice.

Il problema in Italia di solito non son tanto le menti dei ricercatori, quanto il sistema in cui vivono e le risorse che hanno a disposizione.

Detto questo: 

* ENEL ci mette i soldi e si piglia la pubblicita' in US
* Roma si vede dei reperti catalogati e studiati in maniera che, per una ragione o per l'altra, non ha avuto possibilita' di fare negli ultimi 150 anni - e correggimi se sbaglio, credo sia piu' facile monetizzare su reperti studiati che su fondi di magazzino
* degli studenti in US hanno la possibilita' di far pratica su reperti che da loro non esistono, contribuendo gratuitamente al corpus culturale sulla storia Romana che e' patrimonio collettivo

E' davvero cosi' sbagliato?  Magari si sarebbe potuto fare in maniera leggermente diversa, ma visto e considerato che abbiamo ancora una quantita' di reperti incommensurabile accatastata in giro, spedirne qualcuno in US a costo zero crea tanto danno?

Das ganze hat viele Facetten. Ursprünglich hat ein junger Mann, der von seiner Freundin (Zoe Quinn, eine Indie-Spielentwicklerin) nicht nett behandelt wurde, einen langen Artikel über ihre Beziehungsprobleme geschrieben und ihn aggressiv im Internet gestreut. Ein Punkt war, dass sie angeblich mit Journalisten Sex hatte, und diese sie gut bewertet hätten (war aber nicht so). Schnell war ein Hassmob gefunden, der anfing sie und die genannten Journalisten zu belästigen und zu bedrohen. Die Diskussion wurde sowohl auf Reddit als auch auf 4chan stark moderiert, da persönliche Daten der Opfer veröffentlich wurden.

Ein paar der etwas sozial engagierteren Journalisten begannen als Reaktion darauf Artikel darüber zu schreiben, dass der klassische ""Gamer"" als Zielgruppe ""tot"" wäre, man also Spiele für ein größeres Publikum entwickeln sollte. Dies löste eine Kettenreaktion aus, in der sich #Gamergate entwickelte und auf Twitter, 8chan und schließlich Reddit organisierte. 

Seitdem versucht Gamergate die ihrer Meinung nach unethischen Zustände im Spielejournalismus (am Beispiel von ""Sex für Reviews"" und internen Journalisten-Mailinglisten) zu bekämpfen, in dem sie Emails an Firmen schreiben, die auf den Spieleseiten werben (aber nicht Spielestudios oder so).

Ein weiterer Schauplatz ist der Kampf gegen political correctness (bzw Social Justice Warrior), Feminismus und somit Anita Sarkeesian, Zoe Quinn etc. Das ist ein Antijerk der schon länger brodelt (siehe /r/TumblrInAction) und momentan voll in Fahrt ist.

&gt;The __Vasco da Gama Bridge__ ([Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language): *Ponte Vasco da Gama*; pronounced: [ˈpõt(ɨ) ˈvaʃku dɐ ˈɡɐmɐ]) is a [cable-stayed bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable-stayed_bridge) flanked by [viaducts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viaduct) and rangeviews that spans the [Tagus River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagus) in [Parque das Nações](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parque_das_Na%C3%A7%C3%B5es) in [Lisbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon), capital of [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal). It is the [longest bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bridges_by_length) in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) (including viaducts),  with a total length of 17.2 km (10.7 mi), including 0.829 km (0.5 mi) for the main bridge, 11.5 km (7.1 mi) in viaducts, and 4.8 km (3.0 mi) in dedicated access roads. Its purpose is to alleviate the congestion on Lisbon's other bridge ([25 de Abril Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25_de_Abril_Bridge)), and to join previously unconnected motorways radiating from Lisbon.

Einige tun das. Ich finde den Vorschlag aber absurd, da Spielentwicklung inzwischen Millionen kostet. Ebenso absurd ist der Gedanke, Kritik wäre nur legitim, wenn die Kritiker selbst etwas besseres machen. Filme darf man auch kritisieren, ohne Regisseur zu sein. Jedes künstlerische Medium sollte sich dem stellen können.

&gt; Wie kommt es, dass so viele Frauen diese angeblich so bösen Spiele gerne spielen (#notyourshield)?

Niemand sagt, dass man keinen Spaß haben kann, selbst wenn Spiele  problematische Frauendarstellungen haben. Sogar Sarkeesian stellt das explizit voran. Das heißt nicht, dass die Darstellung nicht trotzdem problematisch ist, und man das äußern können muss.

&gt; Wie kommt es, dass die Jeanne d'Arc-Führerinen dieser Bewegung die Hilfe von männlichen SJWs brauchen um ihre miesen Produkte besser aussehen zu lassen als sie sind?

Ich weiß nicht worauf genau du anspielst, aber es gibt nun mal viele Männer, die ihr Geld mit Videospielen verdienen. Die können dann schon mal der gleichen Meinung sein, wie diese Frauen. Ich find Sexismus doof. Ich versteh nicht, warum man Sexismus verteidigen sollte. Ich find, weniger Sexismus würde Spielen gut stehen. Das finden andere Männer auch. Warum hier jetzt ""SJW"" als Beleidigung angebracht sein sollte versteh ich hingegen nicht.

&gt; Warum schaden diese Frauen anderen Frauen in der Branche? 

Weiß ich nicht. Warum schaden ein paar junge Männer diesen Frauen durch Morddrohungen? Schlechte Manieren? Mißgunst?

&gt; Glaubst du ernsthaft, dass die es so schaffen werden irgendetwas an der Situation zu ändern? Ernsthaft?

Ich hoffe, dass sie Entwicklern die Möglichkeit geben, mal vom ""Muskelbepackter Superheld rettet einfach alles durch konsequentes Morden"" Klischee wegzukommen. Dass neue und interessante Storylines in neuen Umgebungen mit neuen Charakteren entwickelt werden und der Mainstream sich weiter streut. Dass Frauen ordentlich bekleidet sein können, anstatt Bikinirüstungen tragen zu müssen

&gt; Meinst du nicht, dass das vielleicht der ganzen Sache einfach nur schadet?

Welcher Sache? Sie kritisieren den Status Quo und machen Spiele mit narrativem Fokus, die für manche Spieler uninteressant sind. Wem können die schaden und wie?

Das Problem ist, dass Journalisten ja genau so dummes Pack sind. Diese sind ja eigentlich die Schnittstelle zwischen solchem Irrsinn und der Bevölkerung. Da aber auch nur die wenigsten Journalisten wissenschaftlich arbeiten bzw. was vernünftiges studiert habe, bekommen wir immer nur dieses emotionale Infotainment oder eben plumpe Propaganda.

Alles was emotional aufgeladen werden kann und sei es noch so großer Blödsinn erfährt in den Medien zunächst mal Zuspruch, Journalisten sind ja selber eher von der schlichten Sorte. Kritisches Hinterfragen gibt es nur bei Themen die zum Verständnis einen IQ von 2 Metern Feldweg voraussetzen. Die Kritik ist dann aber natürlich emotional und nicht sachlich, schließlich versteht der Journalist die Materie nicht. Auch gleichen sich die Muster stets, so ist alles was gegen die EU geht erst einmal rechtsradikal, alles was gegen Männerdiskriminierung geht erst einmal frauenfeindlich, man kennt ja die Phrasen.

Die Journalisten haben es völlig verlernt sich kritisch und auf einer hohen Ebene mit Dingen auseinander zu setzen. Warum sollten sie auch, genügend Macht bekommen sie auch ohne jegliche Anstrengung.

Verschwörung? Nein, das setzt Absprachen voraus. Hier hat man sich einfach kollektiv entschieden das Denken aufzugeben und sich mit dem Strom treiben zu lassen. Mainstream eben. Da kommt dann sowas bei rum.

Employment is just a contract between two parties. Exploitation is the result of not having a basic income, and thus not being able to refuse shitty contracts.

&gt; This is of course good but hardly interesting since all Western countries already have this in a different form (minimum wage, unemployment benefits, etc...)

Natürlich stimmt es, dass man sich in diesen Kommentaren dann auch mit Trollen und schlimmerem auseinandersetzen muss, das muss aber jeder Youtuber mit großer Reichweite.

Schau dich auf Youtube mal um, dort wurden ihre Videos vielfach kritisiert und auseinandergenommen. Stichwort ""Cherrypicking"". Auch scheut die Dame nicht davor, Material anderer Youtuber ohne Einwilligung zu klauen, wobei das ein anderes Paar Schuhe ist.

So gesehen ist Depression Quest eine Website, gebaut in HTML und CSS. Für mich ist es kein Spiel, sondern eher eine Geschichte, die man ""interaktiv"" steuern kann. Sowas kann ich mit meiner begrenzten Coding-Erfahrung auch machen.

Das ist genauso nutzlos wie deine Aussage oben ""Alle Zocker, die ich kenne, pflichten ihr bei."". Alle Zocker die ich kenne sagen das Gegenteil und nicht alle Spiele kosten Millionen. Du kannst heute mit dem billigsten Mist reich werden. Die App-Industrie lebt davon aber nicht einmal das schaffen sie. Statt dessen investieren sie ihre Beziehungen (die sie offensichtlich haben) und Kohle (die sie offensichtlich bekommen) darin einen Shitstorm anzuregen gegen Spieler im Allgemeinen, gegen Frauen die Spiele spielen und natürlich gegen alle Kritiker weil diese ja Teil der Verschwörung sein müssen.

Sieht das vernünftig aus für dich?

&gt; Das heißt nicht, dass die Darstellung nicht trotzdem problematisch ist, und man das äußern können muss.

Ich glaube über einfaches ""äußern"" sind die schon lange hinaus. Das ist eine Hexenjagt. 

&gt; Ich weiß nicht worauf genau du anspielst

Vielleicht solltest du dich dann doch erstmal über das ganze informieren bevor du dir eine Meinung bildest die auf lückenhaftes Wissen basiert. Sowas feuert das ganze nur unnötig an und führt zu Fehlschlüssen auf Seiten derer die nicht informiert sind. 

&gt; Weiß ich nicht. Warum schaden ein paar junge Männer diesen Frauen durch Morddrohungen? Schlechte Manieren? Mißgunst?

Willst du mir damit etwas sagen, dass die Troll-Grundmasse des Internets nun dieses Vorgehen dieser Frauen rechtfertigt??? Diese Leute sind überall. Sie tauchen in jeder Diskussion auf. Morddrohungen findest zu Millionenfach bei twitter. Wenn ich nur die Hälfte der Morddrohungen in meiner ehemaligen Schule nur halb so ernst genommen hätte wie die hier aufgespielt werden hätte wäre ich nie in die Pupertät gekommen weil ich in irgendeinem Erdloch verhungert wäre. Manchmal frage ich mich ob diese Leute erst seit gestern im Internet sind...das ist doch lächerlich.

Was ist den deine Meinung zu dem Vorgehen der Frauen da?

&gt; Ich hoffe, dass sie Entwicklern die Möglichkeit geben, mal vom ""Muskelbepackter Superheld rettet einfach alles durch konsequentes Morden"" Klischee wegzukommen.

Noch mehr Verallgemeinerungen. 

Es gibt solche Spiele und solche. Wenn du die nicht magst, kauf sie nicht. Gibt anscheinend genug Leute die sie kaufen und denen es egal ist. So ist das im Freien Markt. 

Du hast meine Frage nicht beantwortet: ""Glaubst du ernsthaft, dass die es so schaffen werden irgendetwas an der Situation zu ändern?""

&gt; Welcher Sache? Sie kritisieren den Status Quo und machen Spiele mit narrativem Fokus, die für manche Spieler uninteressant sind. Wem können die schaden und wie?

Wie ich oben schon sagte. Du bist anscheinend nicht wirklich gut informiert und solltest das nachholen bevor du dich voreilig für eine Seite entscheidest.

Doch: 

&gt; [Speculation turned to accusation yesterday, when Zoe’s ex-boyfriend make a post on his own blog, accusing her \(with proof\) of cheating with a number of prominent industry figures. Among them was current Kotaku writer Nathan Grayson, apparently solicitating sexual favours for positive press.]( www.gamerheadlines.com/2014/08/kotaku-and-zoe-quinn-accused-of-exchanging-positive-press-for-sex/)

Ich bin mir auch ziemlich sicher, dass du das weißt.

&gt; Ein paar Journalisten, die alle in der gleichen Mailinglist waren, und alle in irgendeinerweise mit den ""Opfern"" in Beziehung standen. So sozial.

Da stehen alle in Beziehung. Sie arbeiten im gleichen Feld. Man kennt sich. Man unterhält sich. Spielentwickler pflegen Kontakt mit Spieljournalisten. Ob nun die paar Indie-Entwickler das Problem darstellen, oder doch eher EA, Activision etc, deren Werbung auf den Spieleseiten prangt, lass ich mal offen.

&gt; Außerdem stellst du es so da, als würden die Bedrohungen von der Mehrheit der Gamergate Supporter geschrieben, es gibt aber dafür keinerlei Gründe, wieso dies so seien sollte.

Nein, habe ich nicht. Nur, dass als Konsequenz Menschen bedroht werden, von einer anonymen Masse auf Twitter. Ob und in welchem Ausmaß diese mit Gamergate identisch ist, weiß ich nicht. Lies mal ein bisschen genauer, statt einfach die Argumente abzuspulen.

&gt; Nö, gibt genauso so viele Männer die solche Bedrohungen erhalten haben, jeder der in irgendeinerweise im Internet bekannt ist, wird wohl schonmal ähnliche Anfeindungen erhalten haben, nur die meisten sind halt so schlau, diese nicht zu veröffentlichen.

Da ist aber ein qualitativer Unterschied. Ob ich dir sage: ""Ich fick deine Mutter."", oder ich bei dir zu hause anrufe und sage ""Deine Mutter ist gerade auf Arbeit in Firma X und ich komme jetzt zu dir in die Y-Straße"". Oder ob ich herausfinde, dass du bald einen Vortrag hältst und beim Veranstalter eine Bombendrohung lasse. Wenn ich als anonyme Person eine Drohung bekomme ist das anders, als wenn meine Identität bedroht wird. Und das trifft halt größtenteils die gedoxxten Frauen, als auch sympatisierende Spieleentwickler (siehe auch Swatting).",0,1415876983,null,0,false,0,cm19r2b,t3_2m5t82,t1_cm19r2b,t1_cm19lm6,null,1426047762,0,false,de,t5_22i0,0

Statt dessen investieren sie ihre Beziehungen (die sie offensichtlich haben) und Kohle (die sie offensichtlich bekommen) darin einen Shitstorm anzuregen gegen Spieler im Allgemeinen, gegen Frauen die Spiele spielen und natürlich gegen alle Kritiker weil diese ja Teil der Verschwörung sein müssen.

Die App-Industrie wird von den ""Gamern"" ja aber nicht gezählt, weil man sonst mit ""50% der Gamer sind Frauen"" leben müsste. Mobile-Games und Kuhklicker werden ja explizit ausgeschlossen. Selbst die Indiegames, die sie ja entwickeln, zählen dann nicht. Narrative Spiele sind dann schnell ""no games"". So werden die Torpfosten verschieben, bis nur noch AAA-Games Spiele sind. Und die kosten Geld. Viel Geld. Und auf deren Entwickler will man einwirken, damit sie ein paar bessere Stories und bessere Charaktere schreiben. Wo das dann eine Hexenjagd ist, weiß ich nicht. Hast du da Belege oder ist das nur so ein Gefühl? Wo sieht man denn den negativen Impact der ""SJWs"" auf Entwickler?

&gt; Vielleicht solltest du dich dann doch erstmal über das ganze informieren bevor du dir eine Meinung bildest die auf lückenhaftes Wissen basiert. Sowas feuert das ganze nur unnötig an und führt zu Fehlschlüssen auf Seiten derer die nicht informiert sind. 

Ich bin gut genug informiert, danke.

&gt; Noch mehr Verallgemeinerungen

Ne. Du gibst Beispiele für negatives Verhalten auf der einen Seite, ich auf der anderen. Menschen verhalten sich im Internet oft schlecht. Männer wie Frauen. Traurig, ist aber so. Man hofft nur, dass niemand ernsthaft zu schaden kommt.

&gt; Es gibt solche Spiele und solche. Wenn du die nicht magst, kauf sie nicht. Gibt anscheinend genug Leute die sie kaufen und denen es egal ist. So ist das im Freien Markt. Du hast meine Frage nicht beantwortet: ""Glaubst du ernsthaft, dass die es so schaffen werden irgendetwas an der Situation zu ändern?""

Genau. Und freie Rede. Leute können kritisieren, wenn Spiele sexistisch sind. Und sie können das anderen Leuten sagen, die dann vielleicht das gleiche denken. Dann kann es passieren, dass Entwickler umdenken. Blizzard scheint das schon zu versuchen, sie Overwatch (an dem sie offensichtlich schon etwas länger arbeiten, eventuell sogar Pre-Sarkeesian, in jedem fall aber Pre-Gamergate), wo Frauen größtenteils bekleidet sind und man sogar nicht nur weiße Männer zur Auswahl hat.

* aveva i cavalli intestati

* secondo redditometro:  cavalli = spese presunte di mantenimento altissime (non dimostrate, perché l'onere della prova é a carico del cittadino)

* spese alte = reddito necessario non dichiarato = IRPEF evasa = paga

* l'onere della prova non é a carico dell'agenzia delle entrate che deve trovarti documentazione di spese accertate, ma é a carico del cittadino che deve dimostrare la NON ESISTENZA di dette spese


* Dopodiché l'onere della prova é stato espletato sia prima sia in fase di ricorso, portando certificazioni del veterinario circa le spese mediche, foto che attestavano che i cavalli stavano in questa cascina parte della casa e dei PRATI INFINITI dove questi brucavano l'erba. Però il giudice ha ignorato il tutto adducendo il cavillo del ""fatto notorio"", ovvero che LO SAN TUTTI CHE I CAVALLI SONO CARI DA MANTENERE, quindi zitto e mosca. E bada che lo pensavo anche io all'inizio, poi ho avuto il piacere di visitare la cascina/stamberga dove stavano e NO, NON COSTA CARO mantenere dei ronzini se tutto ció che hai é un campo.


Che poi l'approccio può ANCHE avere senso in determinate circostanze. Un AEREO PRIVATO o UNA FERRARI HANNO, alla luce dei fatti, delle OGGETTIVE SPESE che non puoi eludere (bollo obbligatorio, assicurazione obbligatoria, un valore di mercato relativamente certo che difficilissimamente cambia nel tempo)

Un cavallo PUÓ costare tanto se é un cavallo da corsa a inizio carriera tenuto in un maneggio. Questi erano (cosa documentata) delle bestie a fine carriera che sarebbero andate al macello ma visto che siamo hippie salviamo le povere bestiole che gli animali ci piacciono.


A me le cose che, in linea di principio, spaventa tantissimo di tutta questa faccenda (per loro ma anche per me mi capitasse mai qualcosa del genere) é che:

* tutta la documentazione che puoi portare a dimostrazione può essere BELLAMENTE IGNORATA da un giudice (qualora tutto il caso stamina già non fosse un esempio lampante di ciò)

* gente che non ha OGGETTIVAMENTE NULLA per saldare il debito rischi di trovarsi a vita a non potersi intestare nulla e a dover fuggire dai pignoramenti di equitalia.

* che una correzione del redditometro di DIECI VOLTE mi dica in sostanza che il legislatore ha fatto un lavoro TANGIBILMENTE DI MERDA: io ho sempre avuto la percezione che per quanto qualcuno possa votare mentecatti al governo, i danni che possano fare siano sempre sostanzialmente limitati, mentre qui una CAZZATA fatta da Tremonti sta rovinando la vita a una persona che conosco da vicino.

* che pur essendoci stata una correzione, questa potrebbe non essere retroattiva, per cui lo stato mi sta sostanzialmente dicendo ""ah ok scusa abbiamo fatto una cazzata, ma sai che c'é, non importa""

Even the Russians know it, and it completely frustrates them. There was a reason why they completely turned their back on Moscow, and that is distrust. Distrust after more than 55 years of stolen history. That is why NATO enlarged, and there is no other reason for it.

But it really amazes me that you are willing to ignore the signs of multiple independent media sources all over the world, and still stick close to the Russian government its version of events. That being: 'nothing happened, move along people'. I could immediatly kill off Russia credibility (or what's left of it) by obviously referring to the exactly same pattern we saw in Crimea, but that would be too easy.
 
When dozens of other entities say something is white, and one guy still insists that it must be black, I will go with the overwhelming majority. Especially after *again* seeing footage of Russian troops and material crossing into Ukraine and after Russia seems to stick to the ever same strategy. It's the same each and every time: 'we are not in Ukraine'.  If someone in real life during an argument constantly repeats the same type of argument he is either 1) trapped or 2) lying.  

Anyway, given how Russian propaganda (RT for example) has been revealed to be give a partial version of events over and over again should have opened your eyes by now. If not, then the constant threats towards other states, including the Baltic States which have been threatened with open **war** just 2 days ago should have done that much. If you still protect Russia after all this, than I must conclude that you are truly an immoral and despicable person.

Deutschland eine Weltverantwortung trägt. 

Das wäre doch mal interessant zu hören. So ne richtige Begründung warum Deutschland eine Weltverantwortung trägt.


&gt;Keiner verlässt freiwillig seine Heimat, verliert auf der Flucht seine Familie oder lässt sich mit
einem Grinsen im Gesicht sein Eigenheim unter dem Arsch wegbomben. 

Die Konsequenz ist also nicht aus der Nato auszutreten, die amerikanischen Militärbasen von denen die bombenden Drohnen gesteuert werden zu schließen, alle deutschen Soldaten nach Hause holen und nicht mehr an Kriegen teilnehmen zu lassen und sich politisch für den Frieden weltweit einzusetzen, sondern weiterhin Häuser unter fremden Ärschen wegzubomben, weiterhin Terroristen wie die des IS zu unterstützen so lange sie für die Gute^^^TM Sache kämpfen, dafür aber hier alles und jeden in KZähnlichen Zuständen unterzubringen, ihnen ein Leben am Rande des Existenzminimums ermöglichen etc. 

&gt;Niemals kam ich auf den
Gedanken für mein eigenes mir erlebtes Schicksal, andere Menschen verantwortlich zu
machen – mit welcher Begründung stände mir dies zu? Es ist so unheimlich einfach für das
eigene Leid, andere Menschen verantwortlich zu machen. 

Mit dem Denken scheint es bei ihm nicht weit her zu sein, kein Wunder, ist ja auch Politiker der SPD. Die Menschen die vor Krieg und Terror fliehen haben jedes Recht den Westen und auch Deutschland dafür verantwortlich zu machen, insbesondere weil die jedem Mohammedaner der sich einen Peacesticker an die Jacke klebt mit Waffen unterstützen oder gleich eine Invasion des Landes starten.


&gt;Es waren jedoch genau jene Leute, die Weltkriege ausgelöst haben. 

Falsch, es waren die selben die auch heute in der SPD sitzen und meinten ihre Verständnis von Menschenrechten in anderer Herren Länder mit Waffengewalt durchsetzen zu müssen. Es ist egal welche Fahne diese Leute tragen. Die sind in der NSDAP genau so zu Hause wie in der SPD. Jemand anders will nicht wie ich mag? Tja, dann muss dort wohl das Militär nachhelfen. Geht schließlich um Menschenrechte.

&gt; Ne. Du gibst Beispiele für negatives Verhalten auf der einen Seite, ich auf der anderen.

Es ging an der Stelle nicht um Beispiele. Ich habe eine Frage gestellt. Du hast sie mit einem Rundumschlag beantwortet der symbolisch ist für das was diese Diskussion unnötig anfeuert: mangelnde Informationen und Verallgemeinerungen.

Warum hast du eigentlich das KONKRETE Beispiel der Fine Young Capitalists nun gänzlich fallen lassen? 

&gt; Genau. Und freie Rede. Leute können kritisieren, wenn Spiele sexistisch sind. Und sie können das anderen Leuten sagen, die dann vielleicht das gleiche denken. Dann kann es passieren, dass Entwickler umdenken. Blizzard scheint das schon zu versuchen, sie Overwatch (an dem sie offensichtlich schon etwas länger arbeiten, eventuell sogar Pre-Sarkeesian, in jedem fall aber Pre-Gamergate), wo Frauen größtenteils bekleidet sind und man sogar nicht nur weiße Männer zur Auswahl hat.

Du hast wieder meine Frage nicht beantwortet.

Niemand hat hier behauptet, daß irgendwo freie Rede eingeschränkt werden soll. Warum kommst du damit? 

Schießt du dir nicht mit Overwatch selbst ins Knie? Ist dir dabei nicht in den Kopf gekommen, daß es vielleicht nicht so schlimm ist wie du meinst? Ist es nämlich nicht. Wie ich so oft sagte. Du bist einfach nur zu schlecht informiert und dabei kommen so simplifizierte Ansichten von der Spielewelt zustande wie du sie hier demonstriert hast. Wenn ich schon soetwas lese: ""wo Frauen größtenteils bekleidet sind und man sogar nicht nur weiße Männer zur Auswahl hat.""

I really do not see how that is going to be economically viable or that widespread.  Also, how would the drones get their power from? Batteries? Removable ones, or would they need to be charged?

And what if there is nobody home to receive the package, would the drone just leave it there? bring it back?

&gt;German courier company DHL announced the first regular drone delivery service, nine months after it launched its “parcelcopter” project. It will use an autonomous quadcopter to deliver small parcels to Juist, a sandbar island 7.45 miles (12km) off the German coast in the North Sea that is inhabited by 2,000 people. Deliveries will include medication and other urgent goods.

&gt;Although the flights are automated, DHL says the deliveries will be constantly monitored by a ground station to ensure safety and compliance with air traffic regulations.

I did not know this, extremely cool and makes sense in that particular set of circumstances. But DHL is not saying it is economically feasible for most people and packages!

So it's not as simple as drawing a line from the Kremlin to these paid agents -  we're a democracy, right? We can't just shut down whatever NGO's we suspect of financing secessionist activities, right?

Most Latvian Russians aren't necessarily ""political"" patriots of Latvia, but ""economic"" patriots - they know pretty well how shitty economic life in Russia is for the majority, compared to them. How low the level of life is outside of the Moscow and St. Petersburg ring-roads. They know how bad the corruption is, etc.

The real risk, as this article points out, is people in Eastern Latvia who are so poor that they feel like they have nothing to lose, and why not try Russia?

But even then I doubt that any kind of serious unrest could be provoked by Russia, because the population of Krāslava consists of 4085 ethnic Latvians, 2309 Russians, 1548 Belorussians. So that's roughly a 50-50 split, but it would be a small minority of the poorest and most disenfranchised who would want to join Russia. Like in Ukraine, I suppose, but the difference is that Latvia is on alert now, ethnic Latvians know what Russian occupation means (after WWII and the Soviet occupation), and a lot of other factors.

Krāslava is also way too far from Russia (85 km) for there to be easy destabilisation, and it's my gut feeling that Belarus wouldn't be overjoyed at helping Russia stoke instability in its neighboring country whose National Alliance deputies gladly play hockey with Lukashenko's team and call his regime ""democratic"" (yes, one of our nationalist MP's said that :p).

So while this is worrying, it's not something to blow up out of proportion - which is probably that the Kremlin would like very much, panic about secessionists in Latgale and disbelief in the security structures to control these ""activists"". Psyops.

1. dont use so much exclamation marks. In german the real use for it, is for an order. mostly.
2. Your sentences often begin with ""Ich"", It is not incorrect but try not to begin two following sentences with the same word. It just sounds not ryl good.  
3. A little bit to many sentences at the begining. For example.  Just :"" Ich bin gestern, wie angekündigt, in Colorado angekommen. Yours isnt that wrong but just a bit cheese for a letter.

Having a romantic picture of the Syrian struggle, and those who fight against the 'rebels' or government forces, is worrying by *default*. It amazes me that somehow many Turkish youths over here look upon the violent struggle in Syria as some type of just battle and simply disregard *which* factions are fighting there at the moment.

Language tutors are often native speakers. And like all native speakers, they can always say whether something feels correct/appropriate/normal/natural, but can't always explicate why. When they do try to explicate things, they can be embarrassingly off-target, not realising how much they don't know. This is normal human behaviour and nothing to get frustrated about.

My strategy always is to take copious advantage of the tutor as a source of native-speaker insight, as a source of suggestions for how best to phrase things, as a conversational sparing partner, as somebody who corrects my mistakes. But any explicit pronouncements about grammar, I'd take them with a pinch of salt and cross-check everything against a good grammar book (or several -- even grammar books can be written by people who ""don't know how much they don't know"").",0,1415880330,null,0,false,0,cm1acyf,t3_2m5y37,t1_cm1acyf,t3_2m5y37,null,1426047478,5,false,German,t5_2qq51,5

Habe Wahrscheinlich ein wenig hastig geschrieben vorhin und du hast alles Recht meine Aussagen zu hinterfragen.
&gt;  Alle Zocker, die ich kenne, pflichten ihr bei.

Weißt du was eine induktive Schlussfolgerung ist? Ich meinte vorallem, die Medien, die das Thema nun aufgreifen und sich wie Geier auf die Morddrohung stürzen und ihren Lesern, die Abgründe der bösen Spiele-Community zeigen wollen. Dazu kommen Spieler, die keins der von Sarkeesian kritisierten Spiele jemals spielen würden und eher aus der Casual-, GameBoy- oder Kunst-Richtung kommen.

&gt; Was zu beweisen wäre.

Wie /u/grganfs schon angesprochen hat war das mit ""defakto"" ein wenig übertrieben, aber ich mag das Wort. Ein paar mal sind mir eben Dinge aufgefallen, die so einfach nicht stimmen. (Alles was ich jetzt schreibe habe ich so in Erinnerung, korrigiert mich wenn was falsch ist) Beispielsweise, hatte sie mal kritisiert, dass bei der E3 nur (ich glaube) 2 Major-Spiele mit weiblichen Charakteren vorgestellt wurden, was schlicht nicht stimmte, aber dann kann man natürlich überlegen ab wann ein Spiel ein AAA-Titel ist. Jedenfalls gab es dann das Gegenargument, dass große Spieleentwickler wirtschaftlich denken müssen und die meisten Spieler von AAA-Titeln sind eben männlich - d.h. es gibt männliche Charaktere, die Dinge können, die der Spieler nicht kann und er rettet gelegentlich mal eine ""Jungfrau in Not"" (Die in letzter Zeit immer öfter ziemlich coole, toughe Mädels sind.). - Es verkauft sich (leider?). Einer der Ubisoft-Entwickler meinte mal, dass es sich nicht lohnen würde einen zusätzlichen, weiblichen Hauptcharakter in Assassin's Creed zur Auswahl zu stellen, da die Zusatzkosten höher wären, als die dadurch zusätzlich generierten Einnahmen. Dann kam die supertolle über 50% aller Gamer sind weiblich und Sarkeesian, Kotaku etc. haben sich darauf gestürzt um ihre Thesen zu untermauern... ohne allerdings mal zu überlegen woher das kommt. Die Gründe für die 50% heißen ""Candy Crush"", ""Words with Friends"", ""Fruit Ninja"" etc. Klingt eher nicht nach AAA-Spielen, oder?

Hui, hab mich in Rage geschrieben, sorry dafür.

&gt;  Ich fand Depression Quest sehr interessant. Was müsste es denn sein, um ein ""Spiel"" zu werden?

Das war mehr ein Scherz, aber mal unabhängig von dem GamerGate-Blödsinn finde ich Depression Quest ist viel mehr ein Buch als ein Spiel. Ich halte Zoe Quinn tatsächlich nicht für eine Spieleentwicklerin, genauso wie nicht jeder, der eine Kamera besitzt und Fotos macht ein Fotograf ist.

**Aber eine Sache will ich noch klar stellen**
(Womit wir wieder beim Thema Sarkeesian=Israel wären)

Ich halte viele Ansätze von Anita Sarkeesian für sehr interessant, aber das heißt nicht, dass man nichts in Frage stellen kann.
Ein großes Problem des Feminismus ist, dass dessen schlimmsten Feinde nicht zuhören und viele vermeintliche Unterstützer mit übertriebenen Vorwürfen vergrault werden. 
Sie verdient in jedem Fall Unterstützung was die Morddrohungen etc angeht! Aber sie sollte aufpassen, dass sie die Opferrolle nicht ausnutzt um ihre popularität zu steigern.

Nein Spaß, aber wenn man so argumentieren möchte, dass Videospiele einem Verhaltensmuster aufzeigen die dann in die reale Welt mitgenommen werden, hängt das meistens individuell mit der psychischen Verfassung des Spielers zusammen.


&gt;Ist eher ein faktuelle Beschreibung dessen, was Thunderf00t ist, der sich vorher nicht für Videospiele interessiert hat und nun Geld mit diesen Videos verdient.

Er beschäftigt sich seit 2 Jahren mit dem Thema Feminismus bzw. Radikalem Feminismus, welcher bei GG auch eine große Rolle spielt. Meine Frage ob seinen Argumenten dadurch die Basis entzogen wird bleibt stehen.

Deutschland ist eines der wohlhabenden Länder der Welt. Der großteil der deutschen Wirtschaftskraft basiert darauf, dass die Welt halbwegs friedlich ist und wir mit anderen Handeln können. Alle daraus, lässt sich ein Interesse Deutschlands an einer friedlichen Welt ableiten. Darüber hinaus gibt es Werte u.A. im Rahmen der EU aber auch darüber hinaus die Deutschland vertritt. Asyl ist ein _Menschenrecht_ und _Grundrecht_. 

Und ja - ich denke auch aus dem 2. Weltkrieg erwächst für Deutschland immer noch eine Verantwortung eher gutes für die Welt zu tun. 

&gt; Die Konsequenz ist also nicht aus der Nato auszutreten, die amerikanischen Militärbasen von denen die bombenden Drohnen gesteuert werden zu schließen, alle deutschen Soldaten nach Hause holen und nicht mehr an Kriegen teilnehmen zu lassen und sich politisch für den Frieden weltweit einzusetzen, sondern weiterhin Häuser unter fremden Ärschen wegzubomben, weiterhin Terroristen wie die des IS zu unterstützen so lange sie für die GuteTM Sache kämpfen, dafür aber hier alles und jeden in KZähnlichen Zuständen unterzubringen, ihnen ein Leben am Rande des Existenzminimums ermöglichen etc.

Mit falschen Prämissen kommt man dann zu solchen Schlussfolgerungen... Die US-Drohnenpolitik ist makaber und ich bin auch der Meinung, dass das dies nicht auf deutschen Boden passieren sollte. Jedoch ist der Großteil der Flüchtlinge auf andere Konflikte zurückzuführen wo die USA nicht umbedingt immer Schuld sind. Afrika ist partiell die Hölle... Syrien ist - mindestens - als komplex zu beschreiben... etc.pp. 

Deutschland kämpft aktiv nur in Afghanistan und auch dort sind die Soldaten schon zurück geholt worden. Die Linie zwischen Friedensmission und aktiven Kampfeinsatz ist natürlich etwas schwammig aber insgesamt hält man sich noch zurück. 

&gt; Das Flüchtlingsproblem löst sich, sobald der Westen nicht mehr andere Staaten destabilisiert, zusammenbombt, ausbeutet und dort Millionen Gründe hinterlässt überhaupt die Flucht anzutreten. Warum versuchen denn plötzlich so viele Afrikaner nach Europa zu kommen? Doch nicht etwa weil Libyen als sicheres Land mit Zukunftsperspektiven plötzlich in einen Schariastaat verwandelt wurde, in dem Rassismus und Bürgerkrieg herrschen?

Die Realität ist aber _jetzt_ eine Andere. Der Westen brauchte 2 blutige Weltkriege um zu kapieren, dass Frieden wichtig ist. Sicherlich hast du Recht was Ausbeutung und Destabilisierung angeht - aber in welchen Masse das wirklich vom Western gesteuert wird ist teilweise auch kompliziert.

Fin qui mi sono sempre e solo chiesto cosa mi piacerebbe studiare piuttosto di qualcos'altro. Infatti avevo trovato molto più interesse nello studio dell'informatica piuttosto che altre materie che offrono nei licei (tipo latino, storia dell'arte ). Ma adesso potrei scegliere qualche altro campo Che mi darebbe nozioni diverse e forse potrei avere più soddisfazione durante il lavoro. 
Un anno fa avevo scelsi informatica un po' per paura di affrontare nuove materie, pensando che non fossi in grado di superarle, mentre  nell'informatica ero(sono) abbastanza ferrato (il corso di fondamenti di informatica è un gioco da ragazzi) . 
Quindi se devo cambiare vorrei comunque farlo in un ambito diverso dall'informatica.
Devo dire che il mio problema più grande è"" non sapere cosa voler fare da grande"" e diciamo che per tutto questo tempo ho solo temporeggiato tentando una via che mi dasse parecchie opportunità (l'informatica appunto).
Però adesso mi trovo veramente con l'acqua alla gola e sarebbe il momento ideale per cambiare. Infatti il primo anno è parecchio generale e non ci sono troppi esami specialisti.

Ecco questa è la mia situazione. In questo momento cercherò di trovare il lavoro che fa per me(il politecnico  da parecchie opportunità per parlare con tecnici specializzati nei vari settori).
Ti ringrazio per avermi risposto e se hai qualche altro consiglio su lavori da ingegneri specializzati che secondo te possono avere un buon mercato lavorativo(oppure siti che parlano a riguardo) non esitare a scriverli ;) 

PS: i lavori che mi hai consigliato nell'ambito informatico li avevo valutati un po' di tempo e devo dire che non saprei cosa scegliere. Adesso forse ho solo bisogno di trovarne altri in diversi settori per poi fare un confronto. 
Tra due settimane a Milano c'è il codemotion dove parteciperanno varie aziende informatiche e vari relatori che faranno delle esposizioni su argomenti riguardanti il mondo dell IT(forse li mi farò un'idea più chiara)

&gt; Bei den Frauen die in der Industrie arbeiten aber nicht die Meinung der Quinns teilen. Bei den doxings und natürlich durch die Medien/""Journalisten"" die ihre Position verteidigen. 

Gedoxxt wird auf beiden Seiten und es ist auf beiden Seiten zu verurteilen. Bombendrohungen gab es bisher aber nur auf einer. Das Argument, dass Frauen durch SJWs aus der Industrie getrieben werden und nicht durch Gamergate hätte ich jetzt aber schon gern belegt.

&gt; Es ging an der Stelle nicht um Beispiele. Ich habe eine Frage gestellt. Du hast sie mit einem Rundumschlag beantwortet der symbolisch ist für das was diese Diskussion unnötig anfeuert: mangelnde Informationen und Verallgemeinerungen. Warum hast du eigentlich das KONKRETE Beispiel der Fine Young Capitalists nun gänzlich fallen lassen? 

Weil es völlig irrelevant ist. Dein Fragenkatalog sollte wohl irgendwie den beteiligten Frauen, die du scheinbar als ""die Bösen"" identifizierst, die Berechtigung ihrer Ansichten absprechen. Sicher, wenn diese Frauen dann anderen Frauen schaden, ist das heuchlerisch. Genauso heuchlerisch, wie Ethik predigen und gleichzeitig andere Menschen öffentlich verunglimpfen und beleidigen. Das ändert aber nichts daran, dass die Argumente gegen die Industrie und die Kritik an Spielen weiterhin gerechtfertigt sind. 

&gt; Niemand hat hier behauptet, daß irgendwo freie Rede eingeschränkt werden soll. Warum kommst du damit? 

Weil der Ausgangspunkt unserer Diskussion war, dass ich Sarkeesians Kritik als gerechtfertigt ansehe und du dagegen argumentierst indem die Charakter und Motivation der kritischen Frauen und Männer angreifst. Ich sage: Kritik muss erlaubt sein, du sagst: Das ist Hexenjagd.

&gt; Als hätte es nicht Jahre voll von MMORPGs gegeben mit endlosen Konfigurationsmöglichkeiten z.B. Auf solch einer Basis ist Diskussion sinnlos. Du verstehst gar nicht wovon ich rede und ich kann nur mit dem Kopf schütteln ob deiner Unkenntnis. 

Das sind dann aber keine Charaktere. Das sind nur Hüllen, in die der Spieler projeziert. Das zeigt sich daran, dass das Geschlecht größtenteils keinen Einfluss auf das Spielgeschehen hat (außer in gegenderten Klassen, wie damals die Diablo Amazone). Bikiniarmor gibt es auch in vielen dieser Spiele. LoL hat wahnsinning problematische weibliche Charaktere beispielsweise. Die meisten Ego-Shooter haben problematische Frauendarstellungen. Overwatch ist mit seinen ausgeschriebenen Charakteren da mal was anderes. ",0,1415881518,null,0,false,0,cm1alsy,t3_2m5t82,t1_cm1alsy,t1_cm1a5w8,null,1426047362,3,false,de,t5_22i0,3

false,keepthepace,ZZZZZZhacker,Hacker,"En fait je pense que ça rentre dans un débat très technique. Le financement des partis politiques est une machine à gaz dont le fonctionnement change assez souvent. Sarko doit rembourser des aides et payer des pénalités. A-t-il transmis l'intégralité de ces aides à l'UMP ? Si oui, en ce qui concerne les aides, c'est assez direct: l'UMP pourrait faire un chèque à Sarko qui ensuite les paierait, mais pour aller plus vite, les services fiscaux peuvent surement légalement accepter le raccourci.

Pour les pénalités, c'est plus tordu. C'est quoi des pénalités ? Si ce sont des contraventions, il est souvent illégal de les faire payer par un tiers ou de lancer une souscription pour ça. Mais le terme utilisé semble suggérer que non, et que l'UMP, identifiée comme le moyen de financement de la campagne de N.Sarkozy peut tout à fait être dans sa mission en payant ces pénalités. D'une façon générale, il me semble que l'administration fiscale a pas mal d'autorité pour aménager ces paiement et peut autoriser exceptionnellement des choses normalement illégales. 

Là, ce qui semble soudainement poser problème, c'est que toutes ces manips supposent l'UMP d'accord pour partager avec Sarko la responsabilité des dépassement et les assumer. Mais comme il y a une chasse au bouc-émissaire en ce moment, il n'est pas surprenant que certaines voix disent que non, il n'existe aucun accord de cette nature entre Sarko et l'UMP.

Nein Spaß, aber wenn man so argumentieren möchte, dass Videospiele einem Verhaltensmuster aufzeigen die dann in die reale Welt mitgenommen werden, hängt das meistens individuell mit der psychischen Verfassung des Spielers zusammen.

Wenn du aus deinem sozialen Umfeld die Meinung internalisiert hast, dass Frauen schwach sind und Männer stark, dass Männer Frauen helfen müssen, Frauen emotional sind und Männer nicht, kurz, wenn du (wie wir alle) von patriarchalen Strukturen geprägt bist, kann das durch Medien, die das genauso darstellen, verstärkt werden. Die meisten haben irgendwo sexistische Einstellungen ohne dafür explizit etwas zu tun oder das zu wollen. Sicher ist das von Spieler zu Spieler unterschiedlich. Das ist kein Grund, Spiele nicht etwas inklusiver zu gestalten, oder?

&gt; Ich denke aus dem Zeitalter sind wir seit dem Mario-Franchise raus. 

Denk ich halt nicht. Hast du die Videos von Sarkeesian gesehen? Far Cry 3 ist ein wunderbares Beispiel von beiden Motiven (plus eine Dosis Rassismus). Watchdogs hatte Frauen als Sexobjekte. Zwei der Spiele, bei denen es mir letztlich besonders aufgefallen ist. Sarkeesian hat wesentlich mehr Beispiele.

&gt; Wenn sie diese Spiele gespielt hat, warum hat sie dann nicht ihre eigenen Aufnahmen benutzt um ihre Argumentation noch weiter zu verdeutlichen? Klar weiß ich nicht ob sie diese Spiele gespielt hat, aber warum braucht sie die Aufnahmen anderer? Faulheit?

Hat sie teilweise auch (siehe das unleidige Hitmanbeispiel). Ist halt zusätzlicher Aufwand, den man nicht unbedingt treiben muss. Spielen geht out of the box, gute Mitschnitte machen erfordert Arbeit, die man auch ins Schreiben investieren kann. Also meinetwegen Faulheit. Ich finde nicht, dass es eine Rolle spielt, weil ich nicht finde, dass sie die Spiele falsch darstellt.

&gt; Nichtsdestotrotz konstituiert Depression Quest kein Spiel... Und selbst wenn es eins wäre, hätte es für mich persönlich keinen Spaßfaktor.

Es soll auch kein Spaß machen. Ich fand es frustrierend. Aber auch das ist ein Markt für Spiele (siehe Meatboy, I wanna be the Guy etc). Es hat mich deprimiert (ein bisschen). Es stellt einigermaßen dar, wie Depression sich anfühlt und bildet so einen Beitrag zur zwischenmenschlichen Verständigung. Es hat eine Geschichte, es ist Interaktiv. Für mich ist das ein Spiel.

Leute haben mit Amok Lauf in Utah gedroht nur weil sie dort sprechen sollte! Und das ist kein Einzelfall sondern der Trend. Es geht uns alle was an.

Absolut richtig, Sexismus im Alltag jedoch ist nicht das gleiche wie Sexismus in Videospielen. Kinder sollten bereits durch ihre Eltern beigebracht bekommen, wie man andere Menschen unabhängig von Geschlecht und anderen Merkmalen behandelt, diese Aufgabe steht Videospielen nicht zu.
 
&gt;Spiele fuer mich sind auch Spass aber haben auch das Potential Kunstwerke zu werden, was nicht geschehen wird wenn Leute wie Frau Sarkeesian sie unter die Lupe nehmen und die Themen und Tropes examinieren. 

Es gibt bereits viele Spiele die eher als Kunstwerk fungieren und die mir auch gefallen. Klar bekommen die nicht viel Publicity weil sie nicht den breiten Markt ansprechen, aber mit Gewalt zu versuchen den Markt umzupolen funktioniert nicht.

&gt;Ich find dass nicht schlimm das sie auch alte Spiele sich anguckt, es gibt ja Gamer in vielen Alter. Und so eine Analyse ist doch sinnlos wenn man sich nicht die Ursprunge des Genres anguckt. Oder Groessen wie Zelda oder Mario.

Richtig, aber ihre Videos entstehen nunmal in 2013 bzw. 2014, nicht 1980. Der Trend behaupte ich, geht weg von diesen Klischees, da sie bereits ausgelutscht sind.

With a lengthy explaination/description:

&gt;We’ve updated the graphic to include the non-EU members of the European Space Agency (ESA), and changed the text slightly to reflect its broader membership. Canada is the only contributing member not shown on our image, but it is an associate member which contributes 0.008% of its government budget to ESA (compared to Germany’s 0.068% or Italy’s 0.053%).

&gt;The per capita cost of €3.50 has remained the same on the basis that it’s incredibly hard to calculate a fairer one given the complexity of ESA membership! Some member states joined ESA after the start of the Rosetta mission, including the EU as a bloc member, and there have also been changes to EU membership during this period. Consequently, we’ve stuck with our approximate population of 400 million throughout the period 1996–2015, meaning our figure is probably a slight underestimate.

false,Aluhut,null,null,"&gt; In dem Moment, in dem jemand behauptet, 50% der Gamer sind Frauen, kommt als Gegenargument, dass die ja nur mobile Spielen würden und keine ""richtigen"" Spiele. Insofern ja, die Gamer haben Probleme damit.

Wo ""wird das behauptet""? Ich habe den Quatsch noch nie gehört. Vor allem nicht von GG Leuten. Das würde doch überhaupt keinen Sinn machen weil sie ja mit #notyourshield doch genau das Gegenteil beweisen. 

&gt; Gedoxxt wird auf beiden Seiten und es ist auf beiden Seiten zu verurteilen. Bombendrohungen gab es bisher aber nur auf einer. Das Argument, dass Frauen durch SJWs aus der Industrie getrieben werden und nicht durch Gamergate hätte ich jetzt aber schon gern belegt.

Der Unterschied hier ist, daß von GamerGhazi Seiten Leute gegen GamerGate agieren die Einfluss in den Medien haben womit all das schlechte Benehmen aus dem Internet herausbricht und ein falsches Bild der Situation abliefert.

Der Bodensatz des Konfliktes auf dem AUCH gedoxed und gedroht wird ist das was schon seit die Masse das Internet erreicht hat da war und ich sehe keinen Grund warum man dem jetzt mehr Bedeutung zugestehen sollte als all die Jahre vorher. Ausser natürlich man möchte besonders viel Mitleid und Drama erzeugen...

&gt; Weil es völlig irrelevant ist. Dein Fragenkatalog sollte wohl irgendwie den beteiligten Frauen, die du scheinbar als ""die Bösen"" identifizierst, die Berechtigung ihrer Ansichten absprechen. 

Nein sollte es nicht. Ich habe hier nicht Sachen gegeneinander aufgewogen wie du eben oben auch. Ich wollte nur deinen Standpunkt dazu hören weil du extrem einseitig schreibst und es hier auf der Seite die du widerspruchslos verteidigst prominente Personen und Anführer der Bewegung gibt die verwerfliche Sachen getan haben die genau dem entgegen laufen was sie behaupten. Ich finde das ist essenziell in dieser Diskussion. Es sind hier nicht irgendwelche Twitter Kommentatoren mit ihren Fake Accounts bei denen man nicht weiss wem sie gehören. Hier geht es konkret um die Anführer des Dramas. Die Leute die behaupten sie würden falsch behandelt werden behandeln falsch. Sie hetzen und zerstören. Dennoch sind sie der Meinung für ""die Frauen in der Gamingindustrie"" oder ""die Frauen die Spiele spielen"" sprechen zu können. Das ist paradox. Verrückt und etwas widerlich. 

&gt; Das Argument, dass Frauen durch SJWs aus der Industrie getrieben werden und nicht durch Gamergate hätte ich jetzt aber schon gern belegt.

Wo habe ich behauptet, dass sie aus der Industrie getrieben werden? 

So einfach ist das mit den Fehlschlüssen. Es hätte gepasst wenn ich das gesagt hätte oder?

Nein. Das Problem mit diesen Frauen ist, dass sie sich nicht trauen sich zu äußern. Sie gehen das Risiko ein vom Shitstorm als Verräter und Unterstützer der Weiberfeinde diskreditiert zu werden. 

&gt; Das ändert aber nichts daran, dass die Argumente gegen die Industrie und die Kritik an Spielen weiterhin gerechtfertigt sind. 

Wie ich schon sagte, ist diese Kritik nie das Problem gewesen hier. Niemand hat ihnen den Mund verboten. Niemand hat sie daran gehindert bessere Produkte zu entwickeln. DAS TUN SIE ABER NICHT. Statt dessen investieren sie all ihre Verbindungen und Ressorucen darin einen Shitstorm am Laufen zu halten. 

Ich frage zum x-ten Mal: denkst du das bringt es? Denkst du das hilft irgendjemandem??

&gt;  Ich sage: Kritik muss erlaubt sein, du sagst: Das ist Hexenjagd.

Ach und weil ich die Art und Weise kritisiere ist das gleichzusetzen mit Zensur??

&gt; Das sind dann aber keine Charaktere. Das sind nur Hüllen, in die der Spieler projeziert. Das zeigt sich daran, dass das Geschlecht größtenteils keinen Einfluss auf das Spielgeschehen hat (außer in gegenderten Klassen, wie damals die Diablo Amazone).

Wait...wie jetzt? Ich erstelle doch einen Character. Ich kann ihn nuttig oder keusch anziehen. Ich kann ihm eine Geschichte verpassen und er spielt eine Geschichte mit den Quests die er vollführt in der Welt. Warum ist das kein Character nach dir??

Und was. Also jetzt ist es ein PROBLEM, dass das Geschlecht keinen Einfluss auf das Spielgeschehen hat? Ist das nicht die ultimative Gleichberechtigung? Was für einen Einfluss hättest du dir den vorgestellt? Der Hüftschwinger Rassenskill der alle männlichen Character dizzy macht? 

Das wird arg paradox. 

&gt;  Bikiniarmor gibt es auch in vielen dieser Spiele.

Ja und jetzt? Warum nicht? Ich verstehe das Problem nicht. Es gibt Bikinis, es gibt aber auch anderes. Es gibt solche und es gibt solche. Du kannst deinem Char das anziehen oder das.

false,ermah_gurden,flag-de,MEHR BIER,"&gt;Wenn du aus deinem sozialen Umfeld die Meinung internalisiert hast, dass Frauen schwach sind und Männer stark, dass Männer Frauen helfen müssen, Frauen emotional sind und Männer nicht, kurz, wenn du (wie wir alle) von patriarchalen Strukturen geprägt bist, kann das durch Medien, die das genauso darstellen, verstärkt werden. Die meisten haben irgendwo sexistische Einstellungen ohne dafür explizit etwas zu tun oder das zu wollen. Sicher ist das von Spieler zu Spieler unterschiedlich. Das ist kein Grund, Spiele nicht etwas inklusiver zu gestalten, oder?

Sollte man dann nicht eher das Problem an der Wurzel packen und in der Erziehung mehr Wert auf so etwas legen? Inklusivität um jeden Preis halte ich in den meisten Zusammenhängen für sehr schwierig zu gestalten. Wenn du damit meinst, dass man in Videospielen weg vom klassischen ""Schwache Frau, Starker Mann""-Prinzip weg soll, kann ich nur sagen, dass das doch bereits passiert. Schau dir einmal an, wie stark der Videospielmarkt in die Breite wächst!

&gt;Denk ich halt nicht. Hast du die Videos von Sarkeesian gesehen? Far Cry 3 ist ein wunderbares Beispiel von beiden Motiven (plus eine Dosis Rassismus). Watchdogs hatte Frauen als Sexobjekte. Zwei der Spiele, bei denen es mir letztlich besonders aufgefallen ist. Sarkeesian hat wesentlich mehr Beispiele.

Betrachtet man jedoch die Gesamtmasse an Spielen (ausgenommen so Zeugs wie Solitaire und Bejeweled und Konsorten), so sollte man doch feststellen, dass die Mehrheit an Spielen nicht mehr diese ""Tropes"" benutzt bzw. Benötigt.


&gt;Hat sie teilweise auch (siehe das unleidige Hitmanbeispiel). Ist halt zusätzlicher Aufwand, den man nicht unbedingt treiben muss. Spielen geht out of the box, gute Mitschnitte machen erfordert Arbeit, die man auch ins Schreiben investieren kann. Also meinetwegen Faulheit. Ich finde nicht, dass es eine Rolle spielt, weil ich nicht finde, dass sie die Spiele falsch darstellt.

Gerade bei Hitman halte ich ihre Darstellung für überzogen, bzw. Geradewegs falsch. Das Ziel in Hitman ist es unerkannt zu bleiben und lediglich eine bestimmte Zielperson zu töten. Womit wir wieder beim 'Cherrypicking' wären ;)

&gt;Es soll auch kein Spaß machen. Ich fand es frustrierend. Aber auch das ist ein Markt für Spiele (siehe Meatboy, I wanna be the Guy etc). Es hat mich deprimiert (ein bisschen). Es stellt einigermaßen dar, wie Depression sich anfühlt und bildet so einen Beitrag zur zwischenmenschlichen Verständigung. Es hat eine Geschichte, es ist Interaktiv. Für mich ist das ein Spiel. 

Da kommen wir glaube ich auf keinen grünen Zweig, ist ja aber nicht schlimm. Für mich ist der betriebene Aufwand einfach zu wenig um als Spiel zu gelten...

Esatto, credo che per la maggior parte dei casi nessuno assolva l'egiziano, anzi penso che nessuno in quei commenti lo stia anche lontanamente pensando.

Penso che l'espressione stessa ""victim blaming"" sia sbagliata in partenza. Non penso che uno sano di mente dica ""eh, è stata colpa della ragazza"" nel senso di ""la responsabilità della tragedia che è accaduta è sua"".

Però anche dire ""eccheccazz però è stata imprudente"" in qualche maniera viene interpretata come una deresponsabilizzazione del fautore della violenza.

Quindi di solito ci sono reazioni violente a certe affermazioni perché VENGONO PERCEPITE COME un tentativo di dire ""eh non è colpa del violentatore"" quando, ripeto, nessuno vuole anche solo implicare una cosa del genere.

Personalmente, ho smesso di prendere l'argomento, perché non c'è verso, si danno due significati diversi e quindi c'è incomunicabilità.

Edit: ecco puntuali i downvote.

Inklusivität um jeden Preis halte ich in den meisten Zusammenhängen für sehr schwierig zu gestalten. Wenn du damit meinst, dass man in Videospielen weg vom klassischen ""Schwache Frau, Starker Mann""-Prinzip weg soll, kann ich nur sagen, dass das doch bereits passiert. Schau dir einmal an, wie stark der Videospielmarkt in die Breite wächst!

Ich finde es schön, dass der Markt jetzt wächst und langsam die großen Studios hinterher ziehen. Auch in Sachen Erziehung kann ich zustimmen. Allerdings bräuchte es dafür Eltern und Lehrer, die sensibel für das Thema sind, was auch oft nicht der Fall ist.

&gt; Betrachtet man jedoch die Gesamtmasse an Spielen (ausgenommen so Zeugs wie Solitaire und Bejeweled und Konsorten), so sollte man doch feststellen, dass die Mehrheit an Spielen nicht mehr diese ""Tropes"" benutzt bzw. Benötigt.

Ist jetzt schwer aufzuwiegen. Viele Spiele haben ja gar keine Charaktere oder erzählen keine Geschichte (Rätselspiele, Find the object, Mobilegames). Die Kritik bezieht sich größtenteils auf AAA.

&gt; Gerade bei Hitman halte ich ihre Darstellung für überzogen, bzw. Geradewegs falsch. Das Ziel in Hitman ist es unerkannt zu bleiben und lediglich eine bestimmte Zielperson zu töten. Womit wir wieder beim 'Cherrypicking' wären ;)

Ich hab in einem anderen Post was dazu geschrieben. Ich find es unsinnig, sich an dem Beispiel hochzuziehen. Da war genug anderes, das ihren Punkt belegt.

Did dubbed movies prevent them from speaking good English? Nope. So blaming dubbed movies for French people's poor English Skills is not fair. Moreover they don't dub those movies because of a legal constraint that is not true. There is no law forcing them to do so. A dubbed american movie is still an American movie and won't fill the *""quotas""* for *""french speaking movies on tv""* dictated by the exception culturelle laws.

The huge majority of cinemas in Paris show ""VOST"" movies, I never had to double check if it was dubbed or subtitled when booking a ticket, because the parisian audience prefere subtitled movies and the cinema give them what they ask for in perfect conformity with the law.

You seem to have a problem with french mentality regarding speaking a foreign language which has some truths but exaggerations as well. I was never made fun of because I manage to erase my French accent when speaking English, it's the opposite actually.

The question that was asked was about ""cultural exception"". /u/IdontSparkle did quite a nice explanation below about it. However, you seem to confuse the protection of cultural diversity on the one hand, and language protection (basically, the Allgood Act - [Loi Toubon '94](http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000005616341)).

You seem to only refer to ""that law"", so it's safe to say you're talking about Loi Toubon. In does not apply to cultural products but the advertisement and instruction of goods and services (as well as official/public entity communications).

The reason movies are dubbed are is to widen the audience, especially in less urban areas. However, had ""that law"" forced dubbing, we wouldn't have this abomination of an habit to translate English titles into... more stupid English titles (e.g. ""Cruel Intentions"" became... ""Sexe Intention"", which is not even proper French or English with the spelling, but fuck it, let's use the word ""Sexe"", or ""In Time"", which became... ""Time out"").

Long story short, movie dubbing is not part of cultural exception, since dubbing is made of non-French cultural goods, but is driven by the market.

As to your comment about Education Nationale being responsible for the sub-par English level of the French population, and while I agree that the language curriculum sucks balls in French schools, the Nanny State should not be the sole liable for this failure. French people have always been lazy/unwilling to adapt and talk other languages. And in my opinion, language skills vastly depend on the immersion/sensitivity of the familial background. I sucked really bad at English when I was younger, spending Saturdays in detention just copying irregular verbs to no avails. Until my dad told me that what I bought in English was coming out of his pocket and not my (meager) allowance. Thirteen-year-old me went on to buy comics, lyrics books, and slowly transition to real books.

[Hier zum Beispiel. Oops.](http://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/2m5t82/tagesschaude_entdeckt_gamergate/cm1afgf)

&gt; Der Unterschied hier ist, daß von GamerGhazi Seiten Leute gegen GamerGate agieren die Einfluss in den Medien haben womit all das schlechte Benehmen aus dem Internet herausbricht und ein falsches Bild der Situation abliefert. Der Bodensatz des Konfliktes auf dem AUCH gedoxed und gedroht wird ist das was schon seit die Masse das Internet erreicht hat da war und ich sehe keinen Grund warum man dem jetzt mehr Bedeutung zugestehen sollte als all die Jahre vorher. Ausser natürlich man möchte besonders viel Mitleid und Drama erzeugen...

Ich finde solches Verhalten verurteilenswert. In dem Moment wo große Medien so etwas tun (wie die Bildzeitung gegen Weselsky) ist das sogar strafrechtlich relevant. Bombendrohungen und Swatting sind strafrechtlich relevant. Es ist systematisches Mobbing durch große Mengen von feindselig gesinnten Menschen und sollte nicht verteidigt werden. Ich versteh nicht, warum du das so herunterspielst. Niemand sollte dem zum Opfer fallen, auch nicht aus falsch verstandener ""Notwehr"" gegen die Medien oder andere Gruppen. Das gilt jetzt übrigens für beide Seiten.

&gt; Nein. Das Problem mit diesen Frauen ist, dass sie sich nicht trauen sich zu äußern. Sie gehen das Risiko ein vom Shitstorm als Verräter und Unterstützer der Weiberfeinde diskreditiert zu werden. 

Wenn eine Frau Frauenfeinde unterstützt, ist das kritisierenswert. Ich glaube aber nicht, dass es in der Industrie viele Frauen gibt, auf die das zutrifft.

&gt; Wie ich schon sagte, ist diese Kritik nie das Problem gewesen hier. Niemand hat ihnen den Mund verboten.

Doch. Durch Drohungen. Darum hat Sarkeesian ja so viel Geld gesammelt, eben weil ihr so viel Gewalt entgegen schlug.

&gt; Ich frage zum x-ten Mal: denkst du das bringt es? Denkst du das hilft irgendjemandem??

Ich sage zum x-ten Mal: Sie äußern Kritik an den Verhältnissen. Leute, deren Beruf es ist, Spiele zu machen, können darauf reagieren und tun das auch. Demzufolge hilft es jemandem. Ganz einfach. Es sei denn du meinst, das Kritik nichts bringt.

&gt; Ach und weil ich die Art und Weise kritisiere ist das gleichzusetzen mit Zensur??

Nö. Aber wenn du die Kritik unterminierst forderst du faktisch Zensur. Wenn du sagst: Kritik ist Hexenjagd, sagst du ""Diese Kritik ist zu viel, hört auf damit.""

&gt; Wait...wie jetzt? Ich erstelle doch einen Character. Ich kann ihn nuttig oder keusch anziehen. Ich kann ihm eine Geschichte verpassen und er spielt eine Geschichte mit den Quests die er vollführt in der Welt. Warum ist das kein Character nach dir??

Weil du die Charaktereigenschaften in ihn projezierst. Du baust die Rolle selbst, die der Avatar dann spielt. Der Avatar ist aber eine leere Hülle. Im Gegensatz dazu ist Commander Shepard in Mass Effect keine leere Hülle, sondern ein Charakter, wie in einem Film oder Buch.

&gt; Und was. Also jetzt ist es ein PROBLEM, dass das Geschlecht keinen Einfluss auf das Spielgeschehen hat? Ist das nicht die ultimative Gleichberechtigung? Was für einen Einfluss hättest du dir den vorgestellt? Der Hüftschwinger Rassenskill der alle männlichen Character dizzy macht? Das wird arg paradox. 

Wenn die Kritik lautet: Es gibt keine gut geschriebenen weiblichen Charaktere, dann ist ein Avatar, dessen Aussehen du verändern kannst, keine Antwort darauf. Und nett, dass die nur ein sexuelles Merkmale einfällt, um Frauen abzugrenzen. Good job!

&gt; Ja und jetzt? Warum nicht? Ich verstehe das Problem nicht. Es gibt Bikinis, es gibt aber auch anderes. Es gibt solche und es gibt solche. Du kannst deinem Char das anziehen oder das. Es gibt sogar Nude-Patches und die werden nicht nur von kleinen Jungs benutzt. Und wen interessiert was die Chars in Ego-Shootern an haben? Ich verstehe dein Problem nicht. Nehmen wir an ich bin männlich und ich mache mir einen weiblichen Charakter der aussieht wie eine Nutte. Dann mache ich mich doch über mich selbst lustig damit oder? Wo ist den das Problem hier??

If you want to compare, better do it right then. France also has a lower state debt than the US, just like most of Europe.

&gt; You have to look at a number like that in context.

I'm looking at it from another context. If the government can't contain their finances while there is a ""solid economic growth"" then the system is unsustainable. Yes things ""lag behind"", but this is so far behind that I doubt they'll reach 0% before the next crisis breaks out, let alone pay anything off.

Borrowed from the FED, which is private held by all US banks with a federal license, and not government owned, where they are still viable for payback including interest.

- Leute haben nachgeforscht und herausgefunden, dass er mehrere Artikel geschrieben hatte, wo unter anderem das Spiel beworben wurde, insoweit war das noch ein kleines Malheur was nicht groß viele Leute interessiert hatte und mit einer Entschuldigung und Rüge gegessen wäre

- Stattdessen haben sich die beteiligten Parteien und die versammelte Spielepresse dazu entschieden das zu verschweigen und jede Diskussion dazu zensieren zu wollen. Unter anderem gab es gegen Anfang einen DMCA von Zoe gegenüber eines YouTubers der darüber gesprochen hat: https://twitter.com/mundanematt/status/502658167936126977

Ein recht berühmter YouTuber (TotalBiscuit) hatte sich entschieden darüber zu schreiben, der Reddit-Beitrag dazu hat so um die ~25000 entfernter Kommentare: https://archive.today/wqJBo

Einige der ersten Seiten die darüber geschrieben haben wie GamesNosh, TechRaptor, GamerHeadlines hatten unter anderem ihre eigenen Probleme mit ihren Hosts, Hack-attacken oder Bans und Entfernung ihrer Subreddits und ähnliches: https://twitter.com/GamesNosh/status/501743426111827969 http://i.imgur.com/lwmCLXf.png https://twitter.com/TechRaptr/status/509130046074650624

Auch haben einige von ihnen und zahlreiche YouTuber die darüber gesprochen hatten Drohungen erhalten: https://archive.today/luRmu
&gt;And a very dim view I take. Since publishing the article and ‘going viral’, myself and my colleagues have been subject to threats, illegal attempts to obtain personal information, and illegal attempts to hack the editor account of the site. Nobody should have to receive a phone call from the police because somebody disagreed with an article you wrote on the internet, ever. Still in spite of this, we shall keep the article up and updated for as long as the situation remains relevant to the industry.

&gt;Like GamerHeadlines, YouTube personality TotalBiscuit has also reported that he has become a victim of harassment from defenders of Zoe Quinn and other indie developers for his Twitter post on the subject, available here. Another YouTube star, JonTron, has also come under harassment after reblogging a crude comic involving himself, Zoe Quinn, and the so-called “Five Guys” involved in the controversy.

Es gab zwischendurch auch Hackattacken auf Phil Fish und Leute haben nach Ungereimtheiten bei einigen Spieleseiten zwischen Journalisten und Entwickler, wie auch bei Preisverleihungen wie IGF und IndieCade geforscht und einige interessante Sachen herausgefunden.

Inzwischen wurde um einiges mehr aufgedeckt unter anderem siehe: https://archive.today/iYJPC https://archive.today/83QiV

Ältere Wunden wurden auch wieder herausgegraben: https://medium.com/@aquapendulum/my-letter-to-jason-schreier-about-gamergate-ethics-f890d357188

Nachdem das mit dem Verschweigen und der Zensur in zahlreichen Foren nach hinten losging haben sich irgendwann Spieleseiten dann gemeinsam entschieden doch etwas dazu zu schreiben, was daraus entstand waren 10+ Artikel dass ""Gamer tot sind"" und die ""Gamer-Identität begraben würde"": http://gamergate.giz.moe/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1409546711940__large.jpg

Das haben sich die meisten Leute erst Recht nicht gefallen lassen und #GamerGate ist entstanden (wurde übrigens von dem Schauspieler Adam Baldwin - von Firefly/Full Metal Jacket etc. erschaffen als er irgendwann Wind davon bekommen hat).

Die Erzählung in der Spielepresse war die von einer ""misogynen Horde"" die ""Frauen aus der Spieleindustrie verjagen wollen"". Irgendwann haben sich dann auch noch Anita Sarkeesian und diese Brianna Wu mit eingeklinkt, obwohl die eigentlich nicht sehr viel mit der ganzen Sache zu tun hatten, noch hatten ihre vermeintlichen Drohungen irgendeine Verbindung zu GamerGate, aber das war natürlich gefundenes fressen für die Massenmedien die den Scheiß aus allen Kanälen geplärrt haben: http://www.youtube.com/user/videogamejournalism/videos und alle ""Gamer"" zu ""misogynist straight white men"" erklärt haben. Dass das nicht wirklich viel mit der Realität zu tun hat und eher als Schutzschild vor berechtigter Kritik dient kann man unter anderem hier dran sehen: http://www.cinemablend.com/games/-NotYourShield-Video-Shows-All-Different-Faces-Behind-GamerGate-67173.html

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzwGIHUCtjU

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOuObprVWok

Naja, es sind immer mehr unter anderem auch bekanntere Leute in den Strudel geraten, unter anderem Englischer journalist Milo Yiannopoulos, der ""GameJournoPros"", eine geheime Mailingliste aufgedeckt hat in der sich die ""Elite"" des US-Spielejournalismus beraten hat und unter anderem zusammengewirkt haben wie Sie Artikel schreiben sollen oder reagieren sollen. z.B. wollte ""Ben Kuchera"" von Polygon in einer E-Mail dass The Escapist ihre Diskussion (ein Thread von über 1000 Seiten bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt) schließt. Einige von ihnen wollten Zoe eine Karte mit einigen Geschenken schicken etc. http://www.brightsideofnews.com/2014/09/19/inside-the-secret-world-of-games-journalism/

Unter anderem kam auch Professorin Christina Hoff Sommers mit dazu: http://www.gamesreviews.com/news/09/christina-hoff-sommers-weighs-gamergate-run-gawker-journalist/

Richard Dawkins war kurz betroffen: https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins/status/512110699435524096 

Julian Assange hatte während seiner AMA eine Frage wie er dazu steht, von einem User der wegen des Themas auf Reddit geshadowbant wurde und Wikileaks hatte kurz etwas zu sagen: https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/511654810752655360

Christina Hoff Sommers hatte unter anderem auch einige Videos dazu herausgebracht: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MxqSwzFy5w http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RVlCvBd21w

Da Sie zu rational und Faktenbasiert für die Spielepresse war mussten Sie sie stattdessen in einer Artikelreihe mit ad hominems diskreditieren: http://s15.postimg.org/g90yt3jff/CONSERVATIVE.png

Das schraubte sich außer Kontrolle mit Feindseligkeiten und teilweise auch Drohungen auf beiden Seiten (wobei das wie hier eher sehr einseitig berichtet wurde und auch eher faktisch falsch, bis auf ein paar Artikel: http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/25/gamergate-an-issue-with-2-sides/ )

Spieleentwickler haben sich zu beiden Seiten ausgesprochen, viele Artikel und Videomaterial sind entstanden usw. usw. und hier sind wir 3 Monate später. Die Spielepresse immer noch dabei alle Spieler als eine Horde misogyner Trolle abzutun und bis auf ein paar kleine Änderungen zu Patreon und Offenlegung von Beziehungen auf Kotaku/Polygon/Destructoid die Sie Anfangs eingestanden haben keine Schuld zu einzugestehen.

I don't know if you have ever heard of the ""Tulpenmanie"", but a lot of these economic problems where discovered by the Dutch. When one of those hausses ruptured when seeds of tulps where worth more than a tenfold of their weight in gold or diamants, and people took options on tulps that hadn't grown yet, borrowed payment etc.

The problem of the tulpenmanie was also what led to the crash of the US in 1927. The bubble gets inflated in such a way that one hole in the system leads to an entire collapse.",0,1415885358,null,0,1415885955,0,cm1bkmg,t3_2m5wva,t1_cm1bkmg,t1_cm1ai59,null,1426046854,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

false,Krawall2,null,null,"&gt; Deutschland ist eines der wohlhabenden Länder der Welt. Der großteil der deutschen Wirtschaftskraft basiert darauf, dass die Welt halbwegs friedlich ist und wir mit anderen Handeln können. Alle daraus, lässt sich ein Interesse Deutschlands an einer friedlichen Welt ableiten. Darüber hinaus gibt es Werte u.A. im Rahmen der EU aber auch darüber hinaus die Deutschland vertritt. Asyl ist ein Menschenrecht und Grundrecht.

Interesse ist nicht Verantwortung. Ein Land hat in erster Linie Verantwortung für seine Bürger, nicht für den Rest der Welt. Dass Asyl ein Menschen- und Grundrecht ist streitet keiner ab, die Regeln dazu sind ja auch sehr weit gefasst. Asyl hat aber nichts mit Flüchtlingen zu tun. Das wird zwar gerne vermengt, bleibt aber falsch. Der Flüchtling kehrt nach Ende des Konfliktes in sein Heimatland zurück, der Asylsuchende bleibt bei erfolgreichem Antrag. Dieses Grund- und Menschenrecht steht in Deutschland ungefähr 2% aller Asylbewerber zu, die restlichen Anträge werden nach mehrjähriger Prüfung abgelehnt.

Die Frage bleibt unbeantwortet. Weder Reichtum noch Interesse begründen eine Verantwortung. Deutschland sollte sich aus all dem tunlichst raushalten.

&gt; Und ja - ich denke auch aus dem 2. Weltkrieg erwächst für Deutschland immer noch eine Verantwortung eher gutes für die Welt zu tun.

Darauf muss ich nochmal gesondert eingehen. Aus was genau erwächst denn die Verantwortung für die Generationen danach? Haben wir übermäßig profitiert vom 2ten Weltkrieg, so dass man sagen kann ""Gebt doch mal was ab, ihr wart schließlich die großen Profiteure""?

Deutschland war vernichtend geschlagen nach dem 2ten Weltkrieg. Was die hier aufgebaut haben verdankt man zum einen den USA zum anderen den Russen. Allen anderen ist man höchstens Reparationszahlungen schuldig, für völlig unbeteiligte Länder und Personen die nicht davon betroffen waren entsteht so erst recht keine Verantwortung.

&gt;Jedoch ist der Großteil der Flüchtlinge auf andere Konflikte zurückzuführen wo die USA nicht umbedingt immer Schuld sind. Afrika ist partiell die Hölle... Syrien ist - mindestens - als komplex zu beschreiben... etc.pp.

Afrika ist zum großen Teil Schuld des Westens. Der unterstützt dort wahlweise irgendwelche Friedensbewegungen, schickt Söldner und Geheimdienste, stürzt Diktaturen und errichtet neue, fördert Korruption für die eigenen Konzerne und führt für diese auch mal Krieg. Aktuell in Mali. Frankreich geht es dort um Uranminen und andere seltene Erden.

Libyen ist ausschließlich schuld des Westens. Eine der stabilsten und wirtschaftlich stärksten Demokratien Afrikas wurde zum Wohle einiger mohammedanischer Terroristen niedergebombt.

Syrien das selbe. Erst der massive westliche Support der unter dem Label FSA agierenden ISIS gestattete eine derart lange Operation in Syrien, die Millionen Flüchtlinge produzierte. Deutschland bspw. [unterstützte den IS durch Terroristennachschub der durch das BKA gefördert wurde.](http://www.heute.de/lka-sicherheitsbehoerden-billigten-ausreise-von-islamisten-35279684.html). 

Es ist eigentlich schwerer einen Konflikt zu finden an dem der Westen und Deutschland nicht beteiligt sind als umgekehrt.

&gt;Die Realität ist aber jetzt eine Andere. Der Westen brauchte 2 blutige Weltkriege um zu kapieren, dass Frieden wichtig ist. Sicherlich hast du Recht was Ausbeutung und Destabilisierung angeht - aber in welchen Masse das wirklich vom Western gesteuert wird ist teilweise auch kompliziert.
Meine Güte, dass ist ein Appel für Menschlichkeit und Verständnis jetzt. Wenn du erstmal alle Flüchtlinge rauswerfen bzw. nicht reinlassen willst bist die Welt irgendwie mehr in Ordnung ist, dann ist das ziemlich verlogen.

Der Westen brauchte 2 blutige Weltkriege um zu kapieren das Frieden **hier** wichtig ist. Für den Rest der Welt gilt dies aus seiner Sicht nicht.

That was my point. And OP's comment asked about cultural exception.

&gt; I sucked really bad at English when I was younger, spending Saturdays in detention just copying irregular verbs to no avails

Looks like the way we teach students is at fault there no?

&gt;The reason movies are dubbed are is to widen the audience, especially in less urban areas. However, had ""that law"" forced dubbing, we wouldn't have this abomination of an habit to translate English titles into... more stupid English titles (e.g. ""Cruel Intentions"" became... ""Sexe Intention"", which is not even proper French or English with the spelling, but fuck it, let's use the word ""Sexe"", or ""In Time"", which became... ""Time out"").

You're talking about dubbing and then all of sudden you switch to movie titles being changed. Like for instance, *""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain""* becoming *""Amelie""* in the USA or ""*La Môme*"", the extremely dark and sad Biopic of Edith piaf, becoming *""La Vie En Rose""* because Americans don't know what ""môme"" means but know the ""*La Vie En Rose*"" song.... International distributors market movies differently for different audiences. It's not just France, and it""s not because of the exception culturelle.

Dont do the ""modifizierte Unterlassungserklärung"" on your own as it still can fuck you and then it just gets worse. (also DONT PAY. Not 60%,or 20% or whatever)


Trust me on this one, get a lawyer. Its not THAT super expensive and if you are lucky you wont have to pay anything (besides the lawyer)

You being from australia (and maybe going back), the internet connection not on your name (is that the case?) and so on changes the circumstances. And only a lawyer can give you insight in this case.

Important: If you didn't hear from them (after you picked your lawyer and he handled it) after 3 years the case is cold and done with. This happens pretty often, they only take cases to court that are easy to win. Your isn't as easy(maybe at least).

Many cases aren't brought to court at all, in my cases the first time nothing happened(after 3 years it was done and i did pay nothing), a second time the enemy lawyer changed their tactics. They started to question if my lawyer would also represent me in front of court. If you contact a lawyer it cost between 50-200 euro, and he handles all the writing/the ""modifizierte Unterlassungserklärung"" and so on, you won't get no letters anymore and he keeps track of it. But in that package is not included that he will go for you to court, as this cost extra obviously. So that kind of gave me pressure, but they send those letters (""are you willing to represent your client if we meet in court?"")  to all of his clients, so it wasn't really about me, but people got scared nevertheless. In his case we are talking about like...50 ppl? I dont know, anyways he decided to contact the opposing counsel and said: Everyone is going to pay, thats more you can ask for, but not more then 150 Euro. So instead of paying like 1.5k (what they wanted. But you never pay that full sum) it was rather cheap and i took the chance. Third case  got me like a week before the third year was over, i was surprised they still fucked me so i payed like 700 (they wanted 2k in the beginning, then 1.4k. My lawyer couldn't manage to get the number lower as 700). My lawyer said that we should fight that one but i chickened out. Thats the next thing, courts in germany start to change their minds and winning is actually not so unlikely, hence bringing it to court isn't really in the interest of the enemy client.

Its true that you might get lucky, write you own ""modifizierte Unterlassungserklärung"" and will never hear from them again. Lucky you, it worked for friends, but if they are taking it to court, they rather pressure ppl like that ones instead of people having a proper advocate. 

Also everyone is telling you  that a ""modifizierte Unterlassungserklärung"" is the easy way out, but thats not the case. With that, you telling them that for the next 30 years you will never ever do something similar again, but at the same time you are saying you never did something wrong in the first place. Basically you admit on doing what you always did: not distributing their content.(which we both know, is not true). Its a contract. 
Maybe they find another case (which you aren't aware of you downloaded and can't remember) and then the ""modifizierte Unterlassungserklärung"" will fuck your ass, cause then you got no way out and will keep on paying. 

So to make things simple: Get a lawyer, the letter (Abmahnung) actually might be wrong in the first place (wrong form) and maybe there is no case to begin with for example. All that can only be answered by a professional lawyer. They are specialized in that field (just use google) and as i said, usually not so super expensive. I would look for local ones, as im not sure how the big internet law offices handle that one, as they make money out of you and that only works as long as other law offices are writing those Abmahnungen. They both profit big time of it ( its a game of fear, this always works), so im not sure if they what they do is always in your best interest. In my opinion a local one that has a good reputation (even tho he might cost 50 Euro more ) is the better choice, but thats just my opinion. I might be totally wrong on that.

Most of Europe's public debt is higher than the US if you look at it as a % of GDP, including France. That's not necessarily a bad thing since most of Europe uses it to fund social programs, and public debt is not necessarily bad if it's managed well.

&gt; I'm looking at it from another context. If the government can't contain their finances while there is a ""solid economic growth"" then the system is unsustainable. Yes things ""lag behind"", but this is so far behind that I doubt they'll reach 0% before the next crisis breaks out, let alone pay anything off.

Government spending and the budget deficit have both been decreasing, both as a % of GDP as well as a nominal number. And like I said, US public debt is only 71.8% of GDP, which is behind most first world countries. They don't need to, nor want to pay off all their debt. Look at the list of countries near 0 public debt. North Korea, Libya, Oman, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan. This is not a club of economic powerhouses that you want to join. Public debt is not a bad thing.

I have seen many European films but usually they are just very limited, not only in budged but also in topics. I am frigging tired of Spanish/German movies about the civil war/Nazi Germany. 


Additionally, you should not generalize ""Then we complain"". I have never complained about it.

Ach so. Also weil /u/Sockratte bei /r/de irgendwas behauptet ist das gleichbedeutend mit der Policy von GamerGate? Das ist ja einfach. 

Dann sage ich, daß ihr GamerGhazi alle ein Haufen widerlicher korrupter Heuchler seid. Wegen Fine Young Capitalists und Zoe Quinns Sexytime mit dem Gaming Journalismus.

Das wird uns sicher voran bringen....mein Gott...

&gt;  Ich versteh nicht, warum du das so herunterspielst.

Ich finde das Verhalten auch nicht gut. Das habe ich nie behauptet. Ich sage nur, dass die überzogene Dramatisierung lächerlich ist. Jeder kann einen Twitter Account erstellen und irgendwas posten. So ist das Internet. Es wird beleidigt und es werden Drohungen ausgesprochen. So ist das Internet. Komm klar damit oder lass es. Aber jetzt plötzlich ein Drama aus Tatsachen die schon seit vielen Jahren unabhängig des Aufregerthemas existieren zu machen wirkt heuchlerisch und hinterhältig. 

&gt; Wenn eine Frau Frauenfeinde unterstützt, ist das kritisierenswert. Ich glaube aber nicht, dass es in der Industrie viele Frauen gibt, auf die das zutrifft.

Vor #notyourshield (kein Kommentar dazu?) dachten die GamerGhazi Leute das auch. Ich kenne welche und nach ihren Aussagen sympathisieren mehr mit GamerGate als mit der Gegenseite. Und nein sie sympathisieren nicht mit Frauenfeinden sondern mit GamerGate.

&gt; Doch. Durch Drohungen. Darum hat Sarkeesian ja so viel Geld gesammelt, eben weil ihr so viel Gewalt entgegen schlug.

Zu dieser Aktion habe ich auch schon eine alternative Geschichte gehört. Welche ist wahr? Weißt du es genau? 

Zu den Drohungen habe ich oben schon was gesagt...

&gt; Ich sage zum x-ten Mal: Sie äußern Kritik an den Verhältnissen.

...und ignorierst wieder die Verfehlungen mit denen all das angefangen hat. Aber klar. So läuft das. Wir hatten das jetzt schon ein paar Mal und drehen uns im Kreis.

&gt; Nö. Aber wenn du die Kritik unterminierst forderst du faktisch Zensur. Wenn du sagst: Kritik ist Hexenjagd, sagst du ""Diese Kritik ist zu viel, hört auf damit.""

Also du findest es ist keine Hexenjagt was mit Fine Young Capitalists passiert ist? Du findest es ist keine Hexenjagt wenn Medien zu denen die eine Seite Kontakte pflegt nur deren Seite wiedergibt? Du findest es ist keine Hexenjagt wenn Leute gedoxed werden? Was ist den deren Ziel? Da ist es dann keine Zensur sondern ""Abwehr""? Double standards anyone?

&gt; Weil du die Charaktereigenschaften in ihn projezierst. Du baust die Rolle selbst, die der Avatar dann spielt. Der Avatar ist aber eine leere Hülle.

Er ist keine leere Hülle. Ich mache mit ihm das was die Entwickler in Mass Effect mit Shepard gemacht haben. Das ist die Freiheit die mir das Konzept dieses Spiels dann bietet. Der Character hat am Ende viel mehr Inhalt als der Character eines Single Player Spiels und seine Auswirkungen auf die Spielergemeinde insgesamt müssten doch eigentlich für dich viel wichtiger sein weil sie sich in der Interaktion mit anderen Spielern manifestieren. Ich verstehe das paradoxe Konstrukt nicht, dass du hier versuchst aufzubauen. Auch wenn ich die Motivation verstehe:

&gt; Und nett, dass die nur ein sexuelles Merkmale einfällt, um Frauen abzugrenzen. Good job!

Uh jetzt hast du mich erwischt!

Du hast aus einer Frage an DICH, einen Vorwurf an MICH gemacht. Ohne, dass du auf den Kontext eingehen musstest. Ist das nicht super? Fantastisch.

Genau so geht ihr vor. Es ist so ekelhaft ich würde am liebsten aufhören zu schreiben wenn ich nicht noch 1h Fahrt vor mir hätte...

&gt; Die Frau wird zum Objekt degradiert. Es gibt kein männliches Äquivalent. Komm schon, ist nicht so schwer. 

Niemand wird irgendwo degradiert. Ich bin der Character wenn ich ihn spiele. Deswegen sagt man auch: ICH SPIELE DEN CHARACTER. Aber eigentlich ist es noch viel abstrakter für dich denn eigentlich: SPIELE ICH DAS SPIEL. 

Das Problem existiert halt nur in den Köpfen derer die sich darüber aufregen. Niemand diskriminiert irgendjemanden in einem Spiel. Die Spieler spielen das Spiel wegen dem Spiel. Sie schießen in einem Shooter und sie fahren Auto in einem Autofahrspiel. Sie haben nicht einmal Zeit zum Diskriminieren. IHR seid es die in diese Welt (die ihr totgesagt habt um sie noch mehr zu nerven) einbrechen und den Spielern eure Vorstellungen von Diskriminierung und Frauenhass aufdrückt. Ideen die in EUREN Köpfen gewachsen sind. Das ist es womit die Spieler nichts zu tun haben und diese Einstellung von ""nichts damit zu tun haben wollen"" ist euch so fremd, dass euch nichts anderes einfällt als es zu Dämonisieren. Ihr seid sogar bereit über die Leichen eurer eigenen Leute zu steigen um Recht zu bekommen (#notyourshield). 

Ihr seid nicht mehr als der katholische Klerus vs. die Hexen. Deswegen sage ich es ist eine Hexenjagd. 

Das gute daran ist: die Gamer werden nicht weg gehen. Die Spiele die es gibt wird es weiter geben und es werden weiterhin die Spiele gekauft die sich gut spielen. Die Leute jedoch die ihre potenziellen Kunden beleidigt haben und sie zu Frauenhassern deklariert haben und die sonst keine Erfolge vorzuweisen haben werden irgendwann scheitern und verschwinden. Was von einer brauchbaren Diskussion dann übrig bleibt, wird das sein was die Gamer erzählen werden und du kannst dir vorstellen, dass das sicher nicht fair&amp;balanced ausfallen wird. Somit hat GamerGhazi sich selbst, dem Thema und dem gesamten Klima geschadet.

I highly doubt that there will be any verdict because ICTY is trying to hide it's fuck ups but can't free Seselj of charge because it will make Bosniaks and Croatians mad so they will just wait for him to die.

The fort is fantastic and the bull ring is pretty interesting if you like Spanish history. It's also a great place to eat out so don't be afraid to wander away from the beach to eat- you'll be more likely to get in a situation where you can use your Spanish- as a blonde American you'll probably have the waiters talk to you in English without you asking if you go to places with alot of tourists. 
Public transport is incredible in Spain-if you book in advance you can get to big cities like Seville, Barcelona and Madrid quickly and quite cheaply. The area around Malaga gets alot of tourists so the airport is huge and you can go anywhere in Europe really cheaply-last year I paid €30 return to fly to Malaga from London! Ryanair are great for cheap flights in Europe and Easyjet are normally a similar price. Also you'll probably see Erasmus trips to places like Portugal or Morocco advertised-these are great value and a fantastic way to meet new friends so don't be afraid to walk into somewhere and get a list of the trips they organise.
What I love about the nightlife in Malaga is the sheer amount of bars to choose from so don't just pick a good one and stick with it for the whole of your stay; locals will go to at least 3 or 4. Another tip: most bars won't even open until very late, expect to turn up to an empty bar if you go anywhere before midnight, especially in summer people don't even have dinner until 10. 
I can't give you a really clear idea of what it's like to be an American but as a British guy who looks quite local I got along fine. Because you're blonde people might walk up to you (women especially) in bars and ask where you're from but it's just out of curiosity. People also might refer to you as a 'guiri', it's like the Spanish equivalent of gringo but no offence is meant by it.

false,ohthehorrors,ASTR,Österreich,"Erinnert sich noch jemand an Atheism+? Diese Geschehnisse weisen ähnliche Muster auf und wirken wie eine Fortsetzung mit neuen Sujets. 

Atheism+ begann damit, dass eine bis dato unbekannte Person angab, auf einer Atheistischen Konferenz gefragt worden zu sein, ob sie nicht irgendeine Angelegenheit diskuttieren wolle und zu diesem Zweck sich mit einer anderen Person per Lift in ein anderes Stockwerk begeben wolle. Aus nicht näher nachvollziehbaren Gründen wurde diese Geschichte zum Symptom einer weitreichenden Verbreitung von Sexismus unter Atheisten erklärt, dies ging auch weiter, nachdem sich die ursprüngliche Geschichte nicht belegt werden konnte und zurückgezogen wurde. Die Unterstützer von Atheism+ fielen dadurch auf, dass sie nach einer manichäistischen ""entweder für uns oder gegen uns""-Strategie vorgingen und sich in auffallender Weise. Atheism+ hat letzlich erfolglos versucht, die diverse atheistischen Gruppierungen für ihre eigenen Zwecke zu instrumentalisieren. Da der Großteil derselben kein Interesse an dieser Vereinnahmung hatte, kam es zu Gefechten, die die atheistischen Gruppierungen als Ganzes geschwächt haben, die Entdefaultisierung des entsprechenden Subreddits fällt in dieselbe Zeit.

Das Gebahren der Anti-GG-Fraktion scheint mir sehr an Atheism+ orientiert zu sein. Die moralisierende Selbststilisierung der Protagonistinnen der Anti-GG-Seite halte ich für  fragwürdig. Die angeblichen Drohungen konnten bislang niemandem zugeordnet werden, es wurden laut Berichten auch Unterstützer von Gamergate bedrohte, wesshalb mir nicht ersichtlich ist, warum eine Seite besonders böse sein soll. Den Ursprung der Affäre, die Kritik an fragwürdigem Journalismus halte ich für eine legitime Position. Es ist zu beachten, dass die ursprrünglichen Vorwürfe bzgl. Frauenfeindlichkeit von Gawker, das von Gamergamte kritisiert wurde. Gawker missbraucht seit langem Sozialthemen zum Zweck des professionellen Shitstormstartens um der Klickzahlen willen. Kritik an Gawker, das schlimmer als Bild und Huffington Post zusammen ist, ist notwendig und berechtigt.

Wie genau Gamergate begann und wie es bislang verlief lässt sich nicht mehr eruieren. Auf jeden Fall sicher zu sein scheint, dass eine Frau Quinn Beziehungen zu Journalisten unterhielt, die dafür wohlwollend über ihr textbasiertes Rollenspiel schrieben und diesem einige Nennungen in Wettbewerben verschafften. Diese Beziehungen wurden öffentlich, Kritik daran wurden pauschal als frauenfeindlich diskreditiert. Quinn rief Trolle dazu auf, ein Internetforum für depressive Personen (eigentlich die Zielgruppe von Quinns ""Spiel"") zu trollen, nachdem diese ihr ""Spiel"" als sinnfrei befanden. In diversen, von Gawker herausgegebenen Medien begann eine Publikumsbeschimpfung, an anderer Stelle rief Gawker dazu auf, Computerspieler zu mobben, die dem ganzen innewohnende Doppelmoral hat wohl niemand bedacht. Ein über diese Geschehnisse hinausgehender Überblick scheint schwer zu gewinnen sein. Sowohl auf Reddit als auch auf 4Chan scheint es zu umfangreicher Zensur gegen Gamergate gekommen zu sein. Verbunden mit parteiischen Medienberichten kommt es auch zu Kritik an Medien, die von Gamergate nicht zu unrecht als parteiisch wahrgenommen werden. In der Tat scheinen sehr viele Bericht unkritisch die Position der selbsternannten Videospielkritikerin Sarkesian zu übernehmen, die im Zuge dieser Geschehnisse wieder öffentliche Wahrnehmung erlangte. Kritik an Sarkesian und ihren Positionen, die zum Teil der Killerspiel-Debatte entnommen zu sein scheinen, erfolgt in den Medien nicht. Gamergate scheint mit gewissem Erfolg Werbekunden von Gawker aufzufordern, ihre Inserate dort zurückzuziehen. Sollte dies zum Ende von Gawker führen, wäre der Welt ein Dienst erwiesen.

""SPOILERS  
SPOILERS   
SPOILERS  
SPOILERS  
Parto in quarta dicendo che non ha retto l’hype.  
Mesi di attesa, visto solo il primo trailer, forse ero troppo carico di aspettative.
Quello che non mi si scolla di dosso e’ il senso di generale approssimazione della sceneggiatura, della cura della verosimiglianza scientifica, e un dare per scontate troppe iterazioni.
Non manca un abuso di cliche’ presi dalla science fiction di tutto il secolo scorso.
Punti a caso:

-la “piaga” che piega il mondo e’ appena abbozzata, tempeste di sabbia e verdurame che crepa.
bueno ma facci godere con qualche immagine della miseria umana, facci sentire partecipi della fine imminente e preoccupati per la sorte dei nostri figli. 
Nope: spolveriamo e andiamo di solo mais.

-La NASA si e’ trasferita al NORAD.L’intera base e’ fatta per poter salpare come un’astronave grazie all’antigravita’.Concetto non ripreso, senza origine e senza spiega.
Ci piace che una ventina di scienziati e un centinaio di agricoltori possano far partire un razzo per i bordi del sistema solare.

-Tanto pianto, tanto struggimento, Murph mal saluta il padre e nei fotogrammi successivi McConaughey ha gia’ il suo culo scolpito fasciato dalla tuta spaziale, pressato da 8G di accelerazione.
Oh well.

-La partenza dal pianeta terra avviene col solito razzo a tre stadi, venti tonnellate di combustibile per mettere la nave scout in orbita per l’attracco alla stazione.
Peccato che nel pianeta d’acqua la nave scout riparta come un razzetto cinese verso lo spazio, e NB: la gravita’ di quel pianeta e’ 1.3 volte quella terrestre.

-Questa volta il token afro-american non e’ cazzuto e pragmatico, e’ sconfortato e depresso.Dopo essere rimasto per 23 ANNI in attesa del rientro dei nostri “ha fatto due dormitine” e gli e’ venuto il pizzetto un po’ brizzolo.Nessun cambio nel mood, e’ sempre afroamericano e se possibile ancora piu’ depresso.

-Attraversato il wormhole arrivano idealmente in un altro sistema solare, ma anche in un’altra galassia.
Miracolosamente i clippini alla Vasco della famiglia Cooper arrivano puntuali, possiamo mandare un Whatsapp intergalattico in barba alle velocita’ relativistiche ma ci pesa il culo ad idroponizzare Marte.

-Il cliche’ dello spiegare l’esistenza della quarta/quinta dimensione con due crocette sul foglio, unite poi piegando il foglio, e’ qualcosa che ho visto fare nei peggiori film TV di fantascienza, dagli anni ‘60 agli ‘80.
Non ultimo il compianto Ernest Borgnine in una produzione italoinglese finanziata dalla RAI, e ho detto tutto.
Va da se’ che Borgnine ha la credibilita’ da scienziato come io avrei quella da majorette.

-Il cameo di Matt Damon ricorda tanto quello di Tim Robbins ne “La Guerra dei Mondi”.
Forzato, incastonato a martellate nella melassa del flow cinematografico fino a quel punto.Pure il cambio di registro e’ telefonato e si sgama da lontano un miglio.
Come e perche' Romilly e la sua calvizie afro esplodano nel campo base e' un mistero.

-i tre simpatici robots hanno un design ancora piu’ anacronistico di quello con CPU valvolare del Pianeta Proibito.
La prossima volta fateli direttamente a palla, o triangolo.
E no, non fanno ridere, l’umorismo al 75% ha rotto, fai 10% e vai in sleep mode hasta pronto.

-il “fantasma” e’ presto sgamato.Oh aspetta, vuole comunicare con la figlia? parlano di orizzonte degli eventi e paradossi spazio temporali? ce l’ho, bravo cooper che fai le ombre cinesi con la polvere.

-bello il tesseract. Altra idea spremuta all’inverosimile, ma la rappresentazione dell’infinita’ dei singoli momenti, riferita poi ad un luogo microscopico come quello di una cameretta, e’ davvero forte.

-Le citta’ del futuro fanno schifo al razzo, sembra di stare dentro un rotolo di carta igienica con una torcia all’estremita’.

-A proposito: Nolan hai scassato con le citta' arrotolate.

-Gli esseri della quinta dimensione facciano poco i misteriosi, porgano patente e documenti e spieghino perche’ gli frega tanto della sorte del pianeta.
Aspetta, vuoi dirmi che sono gli stessi esseri umani che intendono salvare loro stessi? me se AGISCONO nel futuro sono GIA’ SALVI, che gliene batte di quattro umani a tre dimensioni di unghie incarnite, sudore e freni inibitori rimossi dall’alcool?

-Murph in punto di morte manda affanculo il padre perche’ e’ piu’ giovane di lei, ma lo fa in modo passivo-aggressivo.

-Non si capisce se Brand, innamorata di Edmund, trovi Edmund o trovi solo il campo base.In ogni caso immaginiamo che pianti i suoi trecento embrioni nella Valle degli Orti (appunto, qualcuno ha capito come avrebbero voluto ripopolare un pianeta con 300 GIRINI?).
Si spera che Cooper possa arrivare dove sta Brand, farle dimenticare quello scheletro polveroso di Edmund, fare breccia nel suo cuore (l’unico in vari parsecs) e procreare come il dio criceto insegna.

-Michael Caine in punto di morte fa una supercazzola clamorosa: “Non e’ vero che non avevo la soluzione all’equazione.. e’ che’..angh...isibabsi...tapioca asdasd….hhhhh”.
Tutto il cinema ha fatto “UUUHH?” e uno poco dietro ha detto “Ho capito!”, la moglie gli ha tirato una borsettata.""",0,1415889439,null,0,1415894440,0,cm1czgt,t3_2m6dbk,t1_cm1czgt,t1_cm1cd8u,null,1426046196,9,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,9

Mich sprechen Stripclubs und solche Spielelemente nicht an, und ich bin einer dieser cisgendered white males, die Patriarchat und Satan persönlich fördern. Was jetzt? Du musst jetzt wohl belegen, dass ich ja unterbewusst doch drauf abfahre, genauso wie alle anderen angeblich auch. Ansonsten kannst du dir sexistische Generalisierungen wie diese sparen, solang du keine harten Fakten hast.

Niemand hat hier harte Fakten. Weder Sarkeesian noch irgendwer, der ihre Videos doof findet. Es geht hier nicht um Fakten, sondern um Meinungen. Wir sind unterschiedlicher. Ich meine, dass Stripclubs in Spielen sind, weil angenommen wird, das junge Männer die Spiele spielen und das gut finden. Das liegt nahe. Ich bin gespannt wie du konstruierst, dass das nicht der Fall ist.

&gt; Überall? Wie gesagt, es gibt Unmengen an Spielen mit muskolösen, Speedo-tragenden Kerlen. GTA hat genug pro-homosexuelle Messages, aber das kehrt man ja gern unter den Teppich.

Genau. GTA ist voll Pro-Homo und so gar nicht borderline homophob überzeichnend wenn man jetzt tatsächlich mal Schwule zeigt. Aber mit den muskulösen Männern am Strand kann man, im Gegensatz zu den Prostituierten, nun mal keinen Sex haben oder sonstwie nützlich interagieren. Die sind dann auch nur Abziehbilder, die Klischees untermauern sollen. Fallen dir noch andere Beispiele ein? Gears of War, weil dort alle Muskeln haben?

&gt; Ich habe nicht generalisiert und gesagt, dass ""die meisten"" Frauen das wollen - ich habe nur angesprochen, dass es homosexuelle Frauen und Transgender-Gamer gibt. Aber die helfen deiner Argumentation natürlich nur, wenn sie auf deiner Seite der Diskussion stehen. Das sind alles schon Phänomene, die zahlreich gezeigt haben, wie verlogen die angeblich ""inklusive"" und ""anti-harrassment"" Anti-GG-Truppe doch ist. Frauen sind denen nur was wert, wenn sie die diktierte Meinung nachplappern.

Und falls homosexuelle Frauen und Transgender-Gamer etwas an den Spielen finden, ist es Zufall. GTA macht sich offen über Transgender lustig.

Da un articolo del [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/arts/design/capitoline-museums-in-rome-to-join-with-university-of-missouri-to-catalog-artifacts.html?_r=1):  ""Supervised undergraduate students will assist the museum staff in analyzing the artifacts using various techniques available at the **[Archaeometry Laboratory at the University of Missouri Research Reactor](http://archaeometry.missouri.edu/)**.

In Italia c'è un solo reattore di ricerca (Research Reactor) all'ENEA a Casaccia. Sebbene lì ci siano tecniche analitiche che si possono applicare ai beni culturali, non penso che ci sia un laboratorio specializzato come quello nel Missouri. In ogni caso, non sono metodi di analisi disponibili  ""in qualsiasi università italiana"".

Uno che era nella mia compagnia si portò un suo amico, mai visto, che a prima vista sembrava abbastanza terrificante: enormemente sovrappeso, acne a profusione nonostante andasse per i trenta, una t shirt di Berserk e delle scarpe nere lucide inguardabili. Lo chiamerò Francesco (anche perché si chiama così).

Riuscì a tenerlo a distanza durante la proiezione: rideva sguaiatamente, faceva commenti che per fortuna non riuscivo a sentire, mangiava rumorosamente. Il film non gli piacque, non mi ricordo perché.

Finito il film eravamo fuori a fumare, chiacchierando un po' a casaccio. Si finì a parlare, non so bene come, dell'irrealismo nei film, e io più o meno dissi le cose che sto dicendo qui.

Francesco partì con un pippone su due film: Hulk di Ang Lee, che secondo lui era brutto perché la fisica dei salti del gigante verde non era credibile, l'impatto sul terreno avrebbe creato dei crateri giganti (o qualcosa del genere) e che l'implausibilità del tutto gli aveva fatto decidere che il film era una merda. Continuò, tra i miei facepalm silenziosi, il discorso, spostandosi su quel mezzo capolavoro che è il King Kong di Jackson: tutto un pippone sul fatto che il gorillone si passava Nami Watts tra le mani mentre combatteva, senza che lei si facesse niente, mentre si sarebbe dovuta frantumare tutte le ossa. E per questo il film era una merda.

Quindi questo accettava che esistesse un mostro verde gigante e un gorilla di sei metri, ma non che questi facessero cose poco plausibili.

Chiesi gentilmente di non portare più Francesco al cinema con noi. Ad oggi non l'ho mai più rivisto.

Sie sagt, es gäbe keine Konsequenzen für die Aktion mit den zwei Damen in dem Ausschnitt, dabei ist oben links klar ein Punktabzug zu sehen. Dumm, wenn die eigenen Lügen so offensichtich sind.

Ich finde das nicht offensichtlich. Vielleicht sind die Stripclubs auch aus athmosphärischen oder setting-bezogenen Gründen im Spiel, da gewisse Konotationen folgen. Oder, ganz vielleicht, weil es sie eben auch in der Realität gibt, ob du oder ich sie jetzt besuchen oder nicht.  Jedenfalls bist du ganz stark dabei, Sachen mit Thesen zu begründen, die deiner Agenda passen.

GTA überzeichnet ALLE Charaktere. Aber du bist tatsächlich so verwirrt und glaubst wieder die SJW-Propaganda. Eine Mission, in der du mit einem homosexuellen Freund joggen gehst, er attackiert wird und du den Angreifer verfolgst ist natürlich homophob. Außerdem natürlich voll Damsel in Distress, amirite. Auch vergisst du, dass der Hauotcharakter, die Spielfigur des Spielers, vollkommen gleichgültig gegenüber der Homosexualität seines Freundes und Arbeitgebers ist - wahre Akzeptanz halt.

Meiner Meinung nach sind sehr wenige Spiele problematisch einseitig sexistisch. Aber es ist grundsätzlich und empirisch-statistisch falsch zu behaupten, dass größtenteils Frauen sexualisiert oder unnatürlich dargestellt werden. Es ist ein reines Bullshit-Argument, faktisch unfundiert. In Saint's Row kann der Spieler auch vollkommen frei entscheiden, was in welche Richtung geht, obwohl alles karrikiert dargestellt wird.

Um es nochmal zu sagen: GTA überzeichnet alles und jeden. Es kriegt jeder Fett weg, vom Macho-Bodybuilder über protzige arabische Prinzen bis zu militanten Feministinnen. Es sind Themen, die in der gegenwärtigen Gesellschaft existieren, wenn du sie totschweigen willst, denn ist das so. Aber verurteile nicht andere, die verstehen, was ""Equality"" wirklich bedeutet: Niemand sitzt auf einem Podest.

Penso che sia perché sono argomenti delicati che spesso vanno a toccare punti dolorosi.

&gt;L'argomentazione “sono stato frainteso” fa un po' Berlusconi primi anni '10.

Che è come dire che, se si è accusati ingiustamente di qualcosa, non vale dire ""non è vero, non l'ho fatto"" solo perché molti criminali dicono la stessa cosa, mentendo per sperare di farla franca.

Cioè che l'abbia detto qualcuno a sproposito non lo rende automaticamente falso.

Nel mio caso, so benissimo quali sono le mie intenzioni e i miei pensieri (cioè che la responsabilità sia 100% dell'aggressore e 0% della vittima, che si è trovata in una situazione orribile), e l'ho detto e ribadito dall'inizio.

&gt;Se usi le argomentazioni e la terminologia di chi vuole spostare la colpa sulla ragazza, perché ti stupisci se il tuo messaggio viene interpretato così?

Non mi stupisco, l'ho semplicemente preso come un dato di fatto.

Semplicemente è una constatazione di come un messaggio del tutto neutrale venga interpretato come a sfavore della vittima. Le cause sono diverse e comprensibili, ma il fenomeno c'è.

Die Zeit übt sich mal wieder in massiver Propaganda und unterirdischstem Journalismus, wenn man das überhaupt noch so nennen kann. Heute gelten also schon Youtubevideos als Beweise für die eigene Propagandadarstellung. 

Dass die Ukraine zu einem der am strengsten militärisch überwachten Orte der Welt gehörte als die Maschine abgeschossen wurde, AWACS dort kreisten, Spionagesatelliten jeden Zentimeter aufnahmen, Agenten sich gegenseitig auf die Füße traten hat natürlich bei der Aufklärung kein Gewicht. Die haben die Rakete und die gesamten Raketenstellungen schlicht ""übersehen"" und sind außerstande Beweise für diese zu liefern, außer natürlich der wörtlichen Versicherung, dass man mit Sicherheit wisse wer dahinter steckt. Genau könne man das aber nicht sagen.

Die Wahrheit verkünden schließlich Youtubevideos, Facebook und Twitter.

Na dann liebe Zeit, auf vor den Internationalen Gerichtshof und dann als Beweis das Youtubevideo abspielen. 

Die Propaganda ist einfach nur noch unglaublich. Immerhin, nach der reißerischen Stimmungsmache kehrt die Zeit dennoch wieder zum Journalismus zurück:

&gt;Der endgültige Beweis, dass die Separatisten MH17 mit dem russischen Buk abgeschossen haben, sind auch die Bellingcat-Recherchen nicht. Vielleicht wird es ihn nie geben. Aber sie ergeben eine dichte Indizienkette, in die sich die abgehörten Telefonate, die von der ukrainischen Regierung veröffentlicht und zunächst angezweifelt wurden, nahtlos einfügen. Ihre Authentizität lässt sich nicht überprüfen.

Other nationalities have an accent with different characteristics (often intonation related). What's worse is that that other nationalities often have more trouble with syntax and finding the correct word, and this is what makes understanding difficult.

So it's not necessarily the accent that makes someone hard to understand. Imagine a typical American movie with a stereotypical German or Russian villain with a strong accent, and you'll get a good impression how you'll sound to us when you speak German.

&gt;Parto in quarta dicendo che non ha retto l’hype.

Infatti io sono andato a vederlo per sbaglio e senza neanche aver guardato un trailer e me lo sono goduto, la gente si ostina ancora a vedere i trailer nel 2014.

&gt;la “piaga” che piega il mondo e’ appena abbozzata, tempeste di sabbia e verdurame che crepa.

Hai ragione, ma non era questo il focus del film, quindi passi che ci sia una minaccia oscura, frega a nessuno del percome.

&gt; La partenza dal pianeta terra avviene col solito razzo a tre stadi, venti tonnellate di combustibile per mettere la nave scout in orbita per l’attracco alla stazione. Peccato che nel pianeta d’acqua la nave scout riparta come un razzetto cinese verso lo spazio, e NB: la gravita’ di quel pianeta e’ 1.3 volte quella terrestre.

Ti sei risposto da solo, la navetta è, appunto, una navetta, e non uno shuttle a tre moduli, quindi a occhio con un po' di approssimatologia ci sta che il la navetta non abbia problemi a vincere l'attrazione del pianeta.

&gt;Attraversato il wormhole arrivano idealmente in un altro sistema solare, ma anche in un’altra galassia. Miracolosamente i clippini alla Vasco della famiglia Cooper arrivano puntuali, possiamo mandare un Whatsapp intergalattico in barba alle velocita’ relativistiche ma ci pesa il culo ad idroponizzare Marte.

Questo ha urtato anche me, se ci vogliono minuti per una comunicazione Terra-Marte, cos'è sta roba dei segnali intergalattici? E perché funziona a un solo senso? Però vabbé, personalmente ho chiuso un occhio per amor di sospensione della credibilità, ma capisco che può infastidire.

&gt; Er macht ihn [den Screenshot] unangemeldet

Das funktioniert auch nicht ganz, denn er betrachtet ja erst drei Minuten, beschließt dann, einen Screenshot zu machen, loggt sich dann aus und ruft die Seite dann nochmal auf, dann müßten da auch drei Minuten stehen. Und soweit ich weiß (habe mich noch nicht so richtig mit Twitter befaßt) zählt die Zeit sowieso automatisch per Javascript hoch, ähnlich wie bei Reddit.

Außerdem müßte der, der das Bild macht, wenn er sich aus Sicherheitsgründen extra ausloggt, es darauf angelegt haben, daß Anita das ohne Überprüfung einfach so veröffentlicht und nicht etwa ihren eigenen Screenshot macht, sonst hätte er ihr einfach nen Link zu den Beiträgen schicken können, das wäre sogar noch schneller und sicherer gewesen. Es kann sein, daß er zufällig genau den letzten Post zufällig in dem Augenblick gefunden hat (wie soll er da so schnell drüber gestolpert sein?), sodaß 12 Sekunden für Ausloggen, Wiederfinden und Screenshot machen, weil er vermuten mußte, daß der Account schon gesperrt ist, wenn Anita das überprüfen möchte, und deswegen ihr nichts anderes übrig blieb, als den gesendeten Screenshot zu posten. Das sich alles auszudenken müßte dann ebenfalls in die 12 Sekunden fallen, dafür müßte er ein ziemliches Genie sein. Das alles klingt für mich ziemlich konstruiert und nicht unbedingt einfacher, als: Anita macht sich nen Fake-Account, schreibt sich ein paar Messages, loggt aus, macht'n Beweis-Screeny, die Ungereimtheiten entstehen ganz von alleine, weil sie vergißt, ein paar Minuten zu warten, und postet den auf ihrer Seite.

Die Wahrscheinlichkeit, daß das rauskommt, ist imho nicht allzu groß, dazu müßte man ihr zweifelsfrei beweisen, daß das ihr Account war. Sie hätte es dem FBI auch melden können, weil es auch unglaubwürdig hätte wirken können, wenn sie es nicht meldet.

Achso, gut, dass du mit mitteilst, was GG geschafft hat. Die Ethik-Policy von Eurogamer und IGN zählen dann wohl nicht? Das Aufdecken von Vetternwirtschaft und Hypokrisie auch nicht? Jedenfalls darfst du gern mal /r/KotakuInAction und /r/GamerGhazi vergleichen - ist offensichtlich, wo du mehr Feindseligkeit und Unfreundlichkeit findest. Die Zensur im letzteren Subreddit spricht für sich. Poste mal was, dass Anti-GG anzweifelt und zähl die Sekunden. GamerGater sind nicht wütend.

Anita bringt die Idee, dass Gewalt gegen Spielfiguren etwas mit häuslicher Gewalt zu tun hat in der ersten Episode: https://archive.today/lmUvH

&gt;These stories conjure supernatural situations in which domestic violence perpetrated by men against women who’ve “lost control of themselves” not only appears justified but is actually presented as an altruistic act done “for the woman’s own good”.

&gt;Of course, if you look at any of these games in isolation, you will be able to find incidental narrative circumstances that can be used to explain away the inclusion of violence against women as a plot device. But just because a particular event might “makes sense” within the internal logic of a fictional narrative – that doesn’t, in and of itself justify its use. Games don’t exist in a vacuum and therefore can’t be divorced from the larger cultural context of the real world.

&gt;It’s especially troubling in-light of the serious real life epidemic of violence against women facing the female population on this planet. Every 9 seconds a woman is assaulted or beaten in the United States and on average more than three women are murdered by their boyfriends husbands, or ex-partners every single day. Research consistently shows that people of all genders tend to buy into the myth that women are the ones to blame for the violence men perpetrate against them. In the same vein, abusive men consistently state that their female targets “deserved it”, “wanted it” or were “asking for it”

Ihr Produzent, Co-writer und Partner, Jonathan McIntosh hat übrigens Ähnliches auf Twitter dazu gesagt, er ist vor kurzem sogar in einen Streit geraten mit einem Spielejournalisten von GamePolitics: http://i.imgur.com/ZYWosB5.png weil er dieselben Studien und Zahlen benutzt hat wie Jack Thompson.

Er hat auch Zusammenschnitte von entsetzlichen Gewalttätigen LEGO-Werbungen auf seinem YouTube-Kanal: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDThHosFS_0
&gt;A remixed supercut of violence in 22 LEGO television commercials aired between 2009 and 2012. LEGO's marketing to boys has become progressively more and more violent over the years and now focuses primarily on aggressive conflict and combat play scenarios. 

&gt;Ist eher ein faktuelle Beschreibung dessen, was Thunderf00t ist, der sich vorher nicht für Videospiele interessiert hat und nun Geld mit diesen Videos verdient.

Das trifft eher auf Anita zu, die hat sich vorher auch nicht für Videospiele interessiert, nur nachdem Sie gesehen hat dass man damit Geld machen kann.

Never said that you couldn't or shouldn't be. In fact I hope Europeans are proud of this and see what proper funding can do. The EU's economy is larger than the US', but the ESA's budget is almost 4 times smaller. There is plenty of room to grow, and hopefully things like this will be exactly what the ESA needs to get the attention of legislators. I would love nothing more than the ESA and NASA to be similar in size, and hopefully achievements like this will make people realize it is worth the extra funding. Imagine what both could do if they collaborated (which they already do for many things). 

That said, what I dont see with a NASA achievement are condescending comments predicting the end of other space agencies or the decline of other countries (although to be fair its not all on this sub). In this thread when I pointed out NASA's budget has not been cut, it has actually been growing, I was heavily downvoted, although now I am at +1. It has not been growing as fast as the rest of the federal budget, because wars are extremely expensive. But in nominal dollar terms, it has grown 31% since 2000. 

I am not really concerned about the karma but it certainly shows the mentality, despite it being a verifiable fact. I would personally love it if the ESA and NASA had matching funding. I dont really think a NASA achievement is the best time to preach the decline of Europe, and I dont think the inverse should be the case either (I dont actually believe that, just many of the comments I have seen have been very declinist about the US/NASA).",0,1415899270,null,0,false,0,cm1huwz,t3_2m3hwz,t1_cm1huwz,t1_cm191gf,null,1426043870,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

I think those are different people. Probably the local governments (Like marocco in this cause) will want these people gone(because let's face it, no one wants them) so they just employ people to spread these lies. 

Then there are people who want to earn some money, they sell a spot on a boat for a price you could probably take a 4 week cruise from and they move to ""paradise"". 

Just guessing here, but this seems likely to me. 

&gt; It's like they can't fathom the idea that people in Europe don't want them there and don't want people to be able to show up and live there uninvited.

They know some leftist dinosaurs have the idea that the entire world should live like Europe, and that Europe should pay for those expenses, because they see the Western European living standard as basic human rights. 

These leftists dinosaurs know there is no public support for that, but still they show up on tv/media/radio etc. to do their story, and that story is based on a dogmatic believe of stretched morals, which once refused or not held sacred by Europeans, turns the person in a racist, extreme right wing militant, or a nazi. 

&gt;  Why do they think they're allowed to just show up?

I don't think these people really grasp the concept of laws, rules, organisation etc. They go to marocco and there people need to take their hands, put them in a room, feed them, then they complain about how they are treated, and they go to the next. They eventually just end to whereever somebody takes their hand, feeds them and takes care of them. If nobody does that, then they end as my example. Homeless, jobless and living on what generous tourists give them.

There is nothing wrong with living that way. But I just don't understand why they don't build a hut somewhere in Africa, build some food on the land, fish some for some food and live the quiet natural life. It's just that lethargic mentality that everything has to be done for them, instead of by them.

That's a pretty optimistic description of what happened, if you recall what went down at Alec Station. Richard Clarke has talked about this a few times. There was deliberate lying and withholding of information going on, unfortunately. And then, we're only discussing one pillar of an entire pantheon of awkward scheming in the run-up to 9/11, involving the CIA, the FBI, DoD, GIP, ISI, and so on. I am not saying any of it was designed to harm the U.S. from within, but there are people who have a lot more explaining to do than they think they should.

&gt; But the ""accidental"" interception and decryption of John Kerry's and Hilary Clinton's calls?

Yes, I know. A few calls over unencrypted lines. Unacceptable, but still not equivalent. And we now know the NSA spied on more than hundred world leaders.

&gt; Right, but they didn't have to. France is the major European country that opted out of this.

France is part of Nine Eyes, just like Denmark.

&gt; They had all the access they needed, an it required less judicial oversight to obtain than if they gathered it themselves. 

There is no systematic collection of European spy agencies on American citizens. There are no EU spy bases on U.S. soil, like the 7 the NSA has in Germany (and likely many more across Europe), unless you can quote a reliable source exposing this mass surveillance of Americans by the EU. It's simply not true.

&gt;  US citizens are pissed too. 

And that's exactly my point.

&gt;  What annoys me though is Europeans dont seem to care if it is Danish, Dutch, or German intelligence is doing the spying. 

I do.

&gt; Whenever the topic comes up, it is the NSA that is targeted. Again, I can see why they are upset, but if reforms are passed in the US, it is not going to mean all that much if European firms can collect the same data and share it with the NSA.

And we need to stop that, too. But as it is, Nine Eyes, Fourteen Eyes, etc.... are just glorified subsidiaries of the NSA. They collect on their own populations and provide access to the NSA as if they were employees performing an assignment. Unfortunately I fear this isn't far from the truth. The only agencies which seem to have more leeway with the NSA are Mossad and GCHQ, and may be considered a threat to U.S. citizens in my opinion. Yet, they are not equivalent to the NSA.

Coming to terms with this problem requires an appreciation of the NSA's alpha dog status in this situation, while not ignoring the complicity of European intelligence agencies.

If I wanted to drive this point home, I would have to write an even lengthier response, but what to what end? This difference of perception is so widespread, it feels futile. I come away from Reddit with a better understanding of how sensitive citizens actually are when it comes to facing their own country's miscondict, although I feel Germans are an exception.

Polling places have lists of all eligible voters resident in the neighborhood served by the particular station; the voter's notification card (or photo ID such as an identity card, passport or driving licence, if the notification card is not at hand) is checked against these lists before they receive a ballot. Voting is not compulsory.

* TTIP would lead to **net losses in terms of net exports** after a decade, compared to the baseline  “no-TTIP” scenario. Northern European Economies would suffer the largest losses (2.07% of GDP) followed by France (1.9%), Germany (1.14%) and United Kingdom (0.95%).
* TTIP would **lead to net losses in terms of GDP**. Consistently with figures for net exports, Northern European Economies would suffer the largest GDP reduction (-0.50%) followed by France (-0.48%) and Germany (-0.29%).
* TTIP would **lead to a loss of labor income.** France would be the worst hit with a loss of 5,500 Euros  per  worker,  followed  by  Northern  European  Countries  (-4,800  Euros  per  worker), United Kingdom (-4,200 Euros per worker) and Germany (-3,400 Euros per worker).
*  TTIP would **lead to job losses.** We calculate that approximately 600,000 jobs would be lost in the EU. Northern European countries would be the most affected (-223,000 jobs), followed by  Germany  (-134,000  jobs),  France  (- 130,000  jobs)  and  Southern  European  countries  (-90,000).
* TTIP  would  lead  to  a reduction  of  the  labor  share of  GDP reinforcing  a  trend  that  has contribute to the current stagnation. The flipside of this decrease is an increase in the share of profits and rents in total income, indicating that proportionally there would be a  **transfer of income  from  labor  to  capital.**  The  largest  transfers  will  take  place  in  UK  (7%  of  GDP transferred from labor to profit income), France (8%), Germany and Northern Europe (4%).

**Autoritär**: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autorit%C3%A4r

&gt; Die Hauptbedeutung kommt in verschiedenen Zusammenhängen zur Anwendung:

&gt;Sozial-psychologisch spricht man von einem autoritären Charakter oder ähnlich von einer autoritären Persönlichkeit und versteht darunter „menschliche Charaktere, die sich durch ein ausgeprägtes Überlegenheitsgefühl, **überzogenen Machtanspruch** und das Unterwerfen Schwächerer auszeichnen und dadurch **Intoleranz, Dogmatismus und Unfreiheit** fördern.“

&gt; Politikwissenschaftlich ist unter anderem die Rede von Autoritarismus als Ideologie bzw. von autoritären Regimen, die sich dadurch auszeichnen, „dass sie a) die **Möglichkeiten demokratischer Mitwirkung stark einschränken**, b) öffentliche Willensbildungsprozesse (**Presse-, Informationsfreiheit**) und die öffentliche Auseinandersetzung über politische Entscheidungen stark behindern und c) die **pluralistische Interessenvielfalt begrenzen**.“

Die fett markierten Auszüge sind bei dir vorhanden. Du sprichst Frauen, selbst wenn ich hypothetisch überwiegender Mehrheit, ihr Recht auf Selbstbestimmung ab, weil deine Meinung ja so viel schlauer und besser ist. Du willst GamerGate, eine Bewegung zur Transparenzsteigerung und Korruptionsbeseitigung, denunzieren und schnellstmöglich beenden. Du siehst nicht ein, dass nicht alle Frauen gleich funktionieren und das Spektrum nicht weniger breit ist als in anderen Bevölkerungsgruppen.

---

**Egozentrisch**: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egozentrik

&gt; Mit Egozentrik wird ein „Egozentrismus der Wahrnehmung“ beschrieben, der die Unfähigkeit bezeichnet, sich in die Rolle eines Anderen hineinzuversetzen bzw. die **Perspektive eines Anderen anzunehmen sowie die eigene Sichtweise als eine unter mehreren aufzufassen**. Sie ist insbesondere eine Eigenschaft des Kindes und nach Jean Piaget als „ein Mangel an einer Unterscheidung zwischen dem Ich und der äußeren Realität“ definiert. Diese Vorrangstellung „führe schließlich zur **Vorrangstellung des eigenen Standpunktes**“.

Du stellst deine Meinung klar als besser dar, weil die Meinung von Frauen ja nicht den Aufwand wert ist. Du siehst deine als **die** richtige Meinung an.

As you probably know the economic situation in Spain isn't the best, and as a result it is very common for local police to be pressed to enforce laws about weed, alcohol in the street, etc. The reason is that more fines = more money for the state.


So if you want to smoke in the street, you should do it in places that don't have a high amount of police around. Basically, keep away from tourist-y places like Plaza mayor where there is going to be a lot of patrolling police keeping muggers away from tourists.

As for el retiro, you won't have any problem as long as you're not blowing smoke in the face of a cop or something. As a matter of fact, there's a group of black guys who are always near the entrance selling weed. I first saw them when I was a young teenager, I'm 23 and I still see them every time I go, they'll even go to you to ask if you want to buy in broad light. 

You won't be able to be there at night though. the park closes at night, at 22pm.

Das sind sicher bestimmt 100 Millionen Reddit Accounts mit 1-4-jähriger post history, ne? Ich hab genau gewusst, dass davon noch was in deine Argumentation gegen die ganzen unzähligen, angeblichen Shills hier eingebaut wird.

Was glaubst du eigentlich, wie viele Shill Accounts hier organisch simuliert werden könn**t**en? Oder überhaupt werden? Shills sind eh alles halbe Wegwerf-accounts und/oder Agendaaccounts. Kann man so easy rausfinden. Aber so inflationär wie du den Shill-Begriff benutzt... hast du hier ja schon auf so einige absolut organische und unauffällige Accounts angewandt - nur weil sie gegen deine eigene Agenda waren? o0


Das is einfach wieder was ich dir schonmal gesagt hab: du flüchtest da einfach in die Verschwörungsideologie und Paranoia - und so werden aus Privatpersonen abseits deiner politischen Linie random Shills. Mit den hunderttausend gefakedten Facebook, oder Kommentarspalten-Accounts hat das gar nix zu tun. Bei denen hör ich täglich bei 10 auf zu zählen. Und die labern eh meist nur oberflächliche, schrille Scheiße die höchstens von Wutbürgern oder anderen Shills geliked wird.*

Und noch was: Selbst wenn du zu 100% einen Shill-Account vor dir hast, ist es immer noch arm, dann nur Shill callen zu können, statt sich mit den Argumenten des ""Shills"" auseinanderzusetzen. Die richtigen Shills müssen nämlich idR kapitulieren, weil sie eben nur irgendwo manipulierend propagieren und Fakten erfinden. Wenn das nicht der Fall ist könntest du aber ja schon fast davon ausgehen, dass der Shill eine besser Argumentation als du selber hat. Wäre halt arm. Theoretisch. Was praktisch nie vorkommen sollte, da bereits theoretisch gilt, dass jemand mit guter Argumentation von vorneherein gar keine Shills braucht.

*Edit: Ok, da hab ich die Shill-Fraktion derjenigen vergessen, die irgendeine oberflächliche Aussage zugunsten ihrer Agendabegünstigten in den Raum werfen, was dann von unpolitischen Waynes und andern Shills geliked wird. Hab ich vergessen extra zu erwähnen - das ist nämlich das was du die ganze Zeit meinst. Also inb4 Vorwurf.

false,mkvgtired,null,null,"&gt; unless you can quote a reliable source exposing this mass surveillance of Americans by the EU. It's simply not true.

I am agreeing with you. But my point was, why would there be? It was shown that European nations could simply request information from the NSA and it would be granted, no questions asked. This came to light in Denmark. So why would European nations be gathering data on US citizens when getting what they need was as simple as filling out a form?

&gt;I do.

You seem to be the exception. I think that Europeans have every right to be pissed about the NSA, but if it was shut down tomorrow there would still be intrusive agencies that dont seem to attract much scorn from anybody, which is what I find unsettling. And I can fully see why a foreign entity doing it would piss people off more, it would me as well. All of that said, I think these practices need to be targeted whether they are based in Washington, London (even more intrusive than the NSA according to Snowden), Berlin, Amsterdam or Paris. I dont think reforms in the US will automatically carry over to European agencies, therefore, I wish more Europeans were angry about them as well. 

&gt;Coming to terms with this problem requires an appreciation of the NSA's alpha dog status in this situation

I fully agree it is the Alpha dog, I am not disputing that. But voters need to be pissed about it where they can change things. I am hopeful the court cases will come to a conclusion that will force reform. I am fairly certain the NSA will be a topic in the next presidential election. At least to me, it does not seem as if there is as much concern about European agencies by European citizens. Those agencies might not be a threat to American citizens but they certainly are to Europeans. Not to mention, if the NSA's capabilities are curtailed, I dont necessarily think European agencies will remain a non-issue for Americans, especially the GCHQ.

&gt;This difference of perception is so widespread, it feels futile.

I think for the most part we agree. You tend to be the exception and would like to hold European agencies accountable. I hope anything I said did not give you the impression I want to absolve the NSA of culpability, that is *certainly* not the case. I would like to see concern from people who can make a difference. When the NSA's activities became public the top comment, with substantial upvotes, was ""USA is disgusting"". When the GCHQ's activities were made public most of the comments were jokes like ""we still got it"" and other comments that clearly did not convey the severity of the situation.

Die Geschichte wird von den Siegern geschrieben.

Während diese Erkenntnis sich bei einem immer größeren Teil der Bevölkerung zumindest oberflächlich durchgesetzt hat, wartet vor allem der Historiker auf das, was man die Konsequenzen dieser Erkenntnis nennen könnte. Die Bereitschaft hierzu ist aber nur sehr bedingt zu erkennen, und dafür gibt es einen Grund.

Dass, was man in der Gegenwart von der Politik als „Die Wahrheit“ verkauft bekommt und das, was später in den Geschichtsbüchern als tatsächlicher Ablauf der Geschichte landet, trennt ein enormes Delay von mehreren Jahrzehnten.

In dieser Zeit schlummern all jene Aufzeichnungen mit dem Stempel „Streng vertraulich“ oder „Top secret“ in den Panzerschränken, die die Geschichte zurechtrücken können und genau das nach ihrer Freigabe auch bewirken.

Kommt die Wahrheit Jahrzehnte später ans Tageslicht, hat das bereits angesprochene Delay von der geschichtlichen Aufklärung den Effekt, dass die Bevölkerung der Gegenwart sich mit den Verbrechen der Vergangenheit nicht mehr identifizieren kann. Entscheidend aber ist, dass Tatsachen, die damals aufgrund der dieser geschichtlichen Lüge geschaffen wurden, nicht mehr rückgängig zu machen sind. Der Irak beispielsweise wurde von den USA wegen erfundenen und gefälschten Beweisen in die Steinzeit zurückgebombt. Seine gesamte Infrastruktur wurde zerstört, die gebildete Mittelschicht vertrieben oder getötet, und die Ölreserven okkupiert.

Geschichte lässt sich nicht rückgängig machen, aber die Geschichtsschreibung lässt sich massiv manipulieren, wenn es den Regierungen in der Gegenwart gelingt, über das Delay der Aufklärung hinweg den Völkern weltweit etwas nicht zu ermöglichen. Nämlich zu erkennen, dass, während sich der Historiker mit den Lügen der Vergangenheit beschäftigt, die Regierenden der Gegenwart permanent neuen Lügenstoff für immer neue Generationen von Historikern liefern.

Aktuelle Geschichte, umgesetzt von aktueller Politik, ist im großen und ganzen Intrige und wird über unterwanderte Massenmedien der Bevölkerung global als „Die Wahrheit“ verkauft. Im weitesten Sinne geht es denen, die vorgeben, Krieg aus humanistischen Gründen führen zu müssen, weniger um die ""Werte der Demokratie“, denn eher um die „Werte des Kapitalismus“: Aktienwerte. Frank Zappa brachte es in einem vor Zynismus triefenden Satz auf den Punkt: „Politik ist die Unterhaltungsabteilung der Rüstungsindustrie.“

Wer als Historiker über das Freilegen der tatsächlichen Vergangenheit einen tatsächlichen Einfluss auf die Zukunft haben möchte, muss in der Gegenwart erreichen, dass die Menschen die sich ständig wiederholende Mechanik der Lügen verstehen, erkennen und sich ihr tatsächlich entgegenstellen. Dies kann gelingen, wenn Menschen lernen, dass die von der Politik „inszenierte“ Gegenwart immer ein Konstrukt ist, dass dazu dient, SIE, die Massen, zu lenken.

Der Schweizer Historiker Dr. Daniele Ganser beschäftigt sich auch mit unserer jüngeren Geschichte. Konkret: Er versucht nicht nur, Ereignisse aufzuarbeiten, die Jahrzehnte zurückliegen. Ganser forscht auch zu Themen wie inszeniertem Terror in der Gegenwart, ausgeführt zum Beispiel durch die NATO, oder auch DER Zäsur in der jüngsten Geschichte, den Ereignissen des 11. September 2001.

Wer sich als Historiker mit seinen Arbeiten derart dicht an die Geschehnisse der Gegenwart heranarbeitet, wirft damit etwas Wesentliches über Bord, was Historiker vor Feinden aus der Politik schützt, da die an der Geschichte beteiligten Politiker längst im Ruhestand oder tot sind, wenn die Wahrheit durch den Historiker ans Licht kommt. Es ist wieder das Delay der Aufarbeitung. Wenn dieses Delay auf ein paar Jährchen zusammenschrumpft, die Verantwortlichen noch juristisch haftbar zu machen sind, arbeitet der klassische Historiker parallel als eine Art Ermittler, der den Strafverfolgungsbehörden wasserdichte Fakten liefert, die die entsprechenden Personen massiv belasten und ganze Regierungen in Misskredit bringen können.

KenFM traf zum wiederholten Male den Schweizer Historiker und Friedensforscher Dr. Daniele Ganser in Basel, um mit ihm nicht nur über die Mechanik der klassischen Aufarbeitung zu sprechen, sondern auch, wie man diese Mechanik durchbrechen kann. Zudem kommt in dem 100-minütigen Gespräch das wesentliche Motiv der meisten historischen Lügen zur Sprache: Macht. Macht, die sich vor allem auf den Zugriff von endlichen Ressourcen konzentriert. Ressourcen sind das A und O, um die Kriege der letzten Jahrzehnte zu verstehen.

&gt;Armenia is absolutely astonishing. For starters there are [three UNESCO world heritage sites in Armenia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Heritage_Sites_in_Armenia). 

&gt;Armenia is a very mountainous country with beautiful scenery but also has nice flat rural parts. There is a lot of history in Armenia with lots of old monasteries and medieval fortresses. There are also a lot of archiological sites, in Yerevan alone you can find the ruines of the ancient Erebuni fortress and the Bronze age settlements of Shengavit.

&gt;Armenia is landlocked but has a large lake which also has nice and beautiful beaches and is perfect for watersports and because Armenia is mountainous it is also great for skiing in the winter.

&gt;Further there is a Stone Henge like structure in Southern Armenia called ""Karahunj"", There is Cave town where people used to live, near Goris. And even further south you can find the Longest non-stop double track cable car in the world, called ""wings of Tatev"", which takes you from a small village to a beautifull medieval monastery build on a large kliff.

But this time with links:

false,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Why not make the EU into something better? I can't understand why your goal is to leave the union when it could be improving the union.

Different people (and different European nations) want very different things from the EU. The position of most Brits in relation to the EU is very far from what most other European nations want, which is a move towards a federal Europe and ever closer union. The UK just wants free trade. For example, the UK has tried to scrap the CAP for the last 40 years without success. I think that at this stage the UK needs to be realistic: it is in a tiny minority with its vision for the EU and it will not reform the EU in the way it wants. Given this, I think the UK needs to do a cost:benefit analysis of leaving the EU versus staying in. I think leaving makes sense on this analysis.

&gt; At least I can't see how that is compatible with you being a pro-European.

I only used the expression pro-European because I was responding to /u/majoortje who had written ""pro-Europe"". But, really, I find the expression somewhat meaningless.

Ideally criteria for being a protected nation would be similar to with NATO. Each nation would have to resolve territorial disputes with their neighbours before getting protected status.

2. Trade - Working out how to best manage interaction between the European and African economies. Baring in mind the immense pressure that developed economies could place on local economies.

3.

&gt;This phrase, shouted by Jesus from the cross, is given to us in these two versions. The Matthean version of the phrase is transliterated in Greek as ηλι ηλι λιμα σαβαχθανει. The Markan version is ελωι ελωι λιμα σαβαχθανει (elōi rather than il-ee and supposedly lama rather than lema).

&gt;Overall, both versions appear to be Aramaic rather than Hebrew because of the verb שבק (*šbq*) ""abandon"", which is originally Aramaic.   The ""pure"" Biblical Hebrew counterpart to this word, עזב (`*zb*) is seen in the first line of [Psalm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psalm) 22, which the saying appears to quote. Thus, Jesus is not quoting the canonical Hebrew version (êlî êlî lâmâ `^azabtânî); he may be quoting the version given in an Aramaic [Targum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targum) (surviving Aramaic Targums do use *šbq* in their translations of the Psalm 22  ).

&gt;The Markan word for ""my god"", ελωι, definitely corresponds to the Aramaic form אלהי, [elāhî](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elahi). The Matthean one, ηλι, fits in better with the אלי of the original Hebrew Psalm, as has been pointed out in the literature; however, it may also be Aramaic, because this form is attested abundantly in Aramaic as well.  

&gt;In the following verse, in both accounts, some who hear Jesus' cry imagine that he is calling for help from [Elijah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah) (*Ēlīyā* in Aramaic).

&gt;Almost all ancient Greek manuscripts show signs of trying to normalize this text. For instance, the peculiar [Codex Bezae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Bezae) renders both versions with ηλι ηλι λαμα ζαφθανι (ēli ēli lama zaphthani). The Alexandrian, Western and Caesarean textual families all reflect harmonization of the texts between Matthew and Mark. Only the Byzantine textual tradition preserves a distinction.

&gt;The Aramaic word form šəbaqtanî is based on the verb šəbaq/šābaq, 'to allow, to permit, to forgive, and to forsake', with the perfect tense ending -t (2nd person singular: 'you'), and the object suffix -anî (1st person singular: 'me').

&gt;In Aramaic, it could be אלהי אלהי למא שבקתני.

Is there anything at all that threatens the continent coming from the UK? One single thing? There are things threatening Europe, including Russia, including low growth and high unemployment, but really none of these things have come from the UK.

&gt; but the film refers the sentiment of doing things together rather than being on different sides on an issue. Lately there has been that sort of tension in Europe around UK, but not initiated by just the UK, which lays out the two sides more clearly.

While there is a tension between rEU and the UK at the moment, I think the suggestion that that tension has the tiniest parallel or relevance with WW1 a bit far-fetched. The current tensions between the UK and rEU are good and to be welcomed. They result from the democratic process, from how people in democracies vote. It seems that Brits and rEUropeans want different things, and we are discussing them in a negotiated and democratic way and at the end of this process the UK will have a referendum. There will be zero bloodshed and zero violence and afterwards we will stay friends. We should welcome different points of view in the context of a democratic process.

Yes, I think that the UK leaving the EU would be best for Europe.

After a Brexit, the EU will realise that it needs to radically reform and really consider what the people of Europe want.

I wouldn't call it white guilt, just acknowledging the atrocities committed that are often being downplayed. Of course we didn't cause every problem in Africa, many simply come from the fact that historically Africa wasn't very developed at all (not counting northern Africa as  it is very different from the sub-saharan) but not admitting our role in destabilizing this region is historical revisionism.


&gt;Europe survived two major wars. It managed to rebuild and to prosper.

Developed nations that had a devastating war that bounced back after it ended. Not the same as a undeveloped African country that has no wealth to rebuild.

As for the development aid we are doing it wrong, simply sending some money and hoping it will somehow help is ineffective and it ends up in the hands of some dictator anyway, the same with sending food. If we are to help Africa we need to focus on building various projects (agriculture, industry etc.) instead of just throwing around money.

&gt;Und noch was: Selbst wenn du zu 100% einen Shill-Account vor dir hast, ist es immer noch arm, dann nur Shill callen zu können, statt sich mit den Argumenten des ""Shills"" auseinanderzusetzen.

Wenn das nicht der Fall ist könntest du aber ja schon fast davon ausgehen, dass der Shill eine besser Argumentation als du selber hat. Wäre halt arm. Theoretisch.

The portuguese government invested heavily in those territories, including building universities, roads and railway networks, and damns for irrigation, flood control and hydroelectric power.

Then, as a consequence of a military coup that overthrew Portugal's dictatorship, those provinces found themselves in bloody civil wars among political factions that went on for two decades, which culminated in the inception of two cleptocracies that manage to generate some of the world's richest people (oddly enough, all related to the current de facto dictators) while their countries scrape the bottom of the world's [human development index list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_HDI).

Negotiations for an Anglo-German alliance in 1901, promoted by John Chamberlain and supported by Cecil Rhodes, failed largely because Britain did not want to be shackled to the crumbling Austro-Hungarian Empire.

Ci sono un paio di cosucce abbastanza stupide, ma che non rovinano il film in generale, come il nigga che funge da personaggio-pretesto con la spiegazione col foglietto di carta. Avrebbe funzionato in molti altri modi, e secondo me sarebbe stato anche meglio toglierla totalmente la spiegazione. E poi l'ammmmore che vince su tutto.

Per il resto chi si lamenta di inesattezze scientifiche non ha ben capito che cosa è andato a vedere. Un film del genere NON deve essere esatto scientificamente (pensa che palle), deve 1.essere ""bello"" (indipendentemente dalla declinazione di bello, in questo caso si punta sulla suggestione) 2. portare un messaggio.

[From ye olde pages of the book of wikipedium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfred_the_Hairy#Death)

*One of the legends that has arisen around his person is that of the creation of the coat of arms from which the Catalan flag (the Senyera) derives today. After being wounded in battle (some versions say against the Moors; others, the Normans), the Frankish king Charles the Bald rewarded his bravery by giving him a coat of arms. The king slid Wilfred's blood-stained fingers over the Count's copper shield, and thus was the Senyera first born, with its four pallets in Gules on Or.*

According to this legent, since this guy's death -who was basically the father of Catalonia as a more or less political enthity- death was in 897, our flag is OLDER.... and [BLOODIER](http://www.ribes.org/centreparroquial/Catalunya/senyera0.jpg)!

Da wären als prominenteste Beispiele Ich, Aluhut, Armyn, MaxRockt, pqvarus - deren Accounts und meinen Account du ein und demselben Shill zugeordnet hast. Link? [Bitte.](https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/2faxpy/osze_stellt_kein_russisches_milit%C3%A4r_in_der/)

Ich glaube es gab weitere Gelegenheiten bei denen der Shill-Vorwurf fiel. Ich bin mir aber nicht mehr sicher ob und gegen wen genau. Also lehn Ich mich mal lieber nicht zu weit aus dem Fenster.

&gt;Was genau ist denn deine Definition von Shill? 

Na die [allgemeine Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shill). Hat das überhaupt Belang, also wieso sollte meine Def von der allg Def abweichen?

&gt;Ich bin der schon der Meinung, dass es wichtig ist zu wissen, dass da jemand mit manipulatorischer Absicht schreibt. Ich glaube es geht gar nicht so vielen, darum argumentatorisch rein und ordentlich ein Wortgefecht zu gewinnen, was dir so wichtig zu seien scheint. Viele nutzen Kommentarfunktionen einfach, um persönliche Meinungen und Erfahrungen zu teilen. 

Also Shillen kostet ja Geld, sind wir uns einig? Das heißt, es wird eigentlich nur für wirtschaftlich motivierte PR-Aktionen und vielleicht noch für außenpolitische (also immer auch gleichzeitig wirtschaftliche) Meinungspropaganda gebraucht.

Wo einem ein wirtschaftlicher Nutzen entsteht, entsteht einem anderen meist ein negativer Schaden, nicht? Also werden immer beide versuchen zu shillen, würd ich mal sagen.

Heißt: Keiner der beiden Kontrahenten wird eine efektive Meinungshoheit erlangen können.

Mit dieser Argumentationskette will ich nicht shillen entschuldigen, relativieren oder ähnliches - aber ich wil aufzeigen, wieso die Hysterie vielleicht dort unangebracht ist, wo die Effektivität schon ein wenig überschätzt wird. Alles worum es sich dreht, ist doch quasi die angebliche Meinungshoheit die durch shillen erlangt wird. Das zweifle ich ehrlich gesagt *teilweise* und unter bestimmten Bedinungen an. Eben deshalb möchte ich auch ausdrücken, dass die Shill-Problematik im konkreten Argumentationsfall zwischen Diskussionsteilnehmern nicht von unglaublichem Belang - also in Diskussionen vernachlässigbar ist. Ob auf fb zwei entgegengesetzt interessenmotivierte top comments die leute gleichzeitig beshillen ist also effektiv und bilanziert fast schon egal.

2. Viele Kritikpunkte sind Produkt von ""Cherry Picking"". Sie sucht sich kleine Aspekte eines großen Gesamtbildes raus, die ihre Agenda unterstützen, während sie den Rest, darunter Kontraargumente, unterdrückt.

3. Sie ist gewissermaßen die Symbolfigur für SJW-Kulturmarxismus geworden. Mehrfach hat sie auf Twitter extrem ""gewagte"" Aussagen getroffen, von denen sich viele persönlich attackiert sehen.

&gt;Director Christopher Nolan said influences on *Interstellar* included the ""key touchstones"" of science fiction cinema; *[Metropolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(1927_film\))* (1927), *[2001: A Space Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film\))* (1968), and *[Blade Runner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner)* (1982).  Nolan said about *2001*, ""The movies you grow up with, the culture you absorb through the decades, become part of your expectations while watching a film. So you can't make any film in a vacuum. We're making a science-fiction film... You can't pretend *2001* doesn't exist when you're making *Interstellar*."" He also said *[Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_(film\))* (1977) and *[Alien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(film\))* (1979) influenced *Interstellar* '​s production design: ""Those always stuck in my head as being how you need to approach science-fiction. It has to feel used—as used and as real as the world we live in.""  [Andrei Tarkovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Tarkovsky)'s *[The Mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mirror_(1975_film\))* influenced ""elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water"".

Sorry, you know nothing about what you're talking about.

It's true there was poverty in african territories.  There was also poverty in Portugal's european territory.  Around two million portuguese citizens emigrated in the 70s.

Meanwhile, the man expected to be Portugal's next prime minister, [António Costa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_Costa) is of Goan descent, and his father was born in Mozambique.

Part of my own family lived and still lives in Angola, Mozambique and Guinea Bissau.   My own family includes people from european and african origin. 

And there are plenty of portuguese university professors who are portuguese but whose origins are all over the globe, from Africa to Asia.

Ma questo non è il punto, non puoi fare un film che parla di viaggi intergalattici e attenerti alle leggi della fisica, non vai da nessuna parte. 

Comunque per rispondere ad alcuni punti del tuo commento:

&gt;La partenza dal pianeta terra avviene col solito razzo a tre stadi, venti tonnellate di combustibile per mettere la nave scout in orbita per l’attracco alla stazione. Peccato che nel pianeta d’acqua la nave scout riparta come un razzetto cinese verso lo spazio, e NB: la gravita’ di quel pianeta e’ 1.3 volte quella terrestre.

punto un po' delicato, si può ipotizzare che la partenza dalla terra con il razzo sia stata fatta proprio per risparmiare carburante per il decollo della navicella dagli altri pianeti, poi magari c'erano provviste/equipaggiamento da caricare nell'Endurance quindi la navicella partendo dalla Terra era più carica.

&gt; Attraversato il wormhole arrivano idealmente in un altro sistema solare, ma anche in un’altra galassia. Miracolosamente i clippini alla Vasco della famiglia Cooper arrivano puntuali, possiamo mandare un Whatsapp intergalattico in barba alle velocita’ relativistiche ma ci pesa il culo ad idroponizzare Marte.

le comunicazioni viaggiano attraverso il whormhole

&gt; Il cliche’ dello spiegare l’esistenza della quarta/quinta dimensione con due crocette sul foglio, unite poi piegando il foglio, e’ qualcosa che ho visto fare nei peggiori film TV di fantascienza, dagli anni ‘60 agli ‘80. Non ultimo il compianto Ernest Borgnine in una produzione italoinglese finanziata dalla RAI, e ho detto tutto. Va da se’ che Borgnine ha la credibilita’ da scienziato come io avrei quella da majorette.

 e come cazzo lo vuoi spiegare? In realtà sono stati molto più precisi nel film, spiegando che un whormhole avrebbe (ammesso esista) una forma sferica.

&gt; Gli esseri della quinta dimensione facciano poco i misteriosi, porgano patente e documenti e spieghino perche’ gli frega tanto della sorte del pianeta.

Ovviamente c'è anche l'aspetto fantasioso di quando vanno dentro il black hole, ma almeno ci fa capire che dentro un buco nero potrebbe esserci una risposta a molte domande che ci facciamo da tempo anche se di sicuro non troveremo una libreria.

Comunque:
&gt; -la “piaga” che piega il mondo e’ appena abbozzata, tempeste di sabbia e verdurame che crepa. bueno ma facci godere con qualche immagine della miseria umana, facci sentire partecipi della fine imminente e preoccupati per la sorte dei nostri figli. Nope: spolveriamo e andiamo di solo mais.

Ok, su questo punto posso in parte essere d'accordo. Ma allo stesso tempo sarebbe stato impossibile aggiungere altri minuti al film

&gt; -La NASA si e’ trasferita al NORAD.L’intera base e’ fatta per poter salpare come un’astronave grazie all’antigravita’.Concetto non ripreso, senza origine e senza spiega. Ci piace che una ventina di scienziati e un centinaio di agricoltori possano far partire un razzo per i bordi del sistema solare.

Non utilizza l'antigravità, ma semplicemente si basa sul fatto che gli umani hanno scoperto come controllare la gravità e come manipolarla. E' realistico questo? Per ora assolutamente no. Potrà diventarlo nel futuro? Forse.

&gt; -Tanto pianto, tanto struggimento, Murph mal saluta il padre e nei fotogrammi successivi McConaughey ha gia’ il suo culo scolpito fasciato dalla tuta spaziale, pressato da 8G di accelerazione. Oh well.

Anche qua stesso discorso di prima. Per quanto ne sappiamo non è detto che non si sia addestrato dopo avere abbandonato la figlia. In ogni caso sarebbe stato inutile e dispendioso fare vedere i passaggi intermedi e penso che il lancio fatto con lui che si allontana con la macchina e la musica di Zimmer sia una delle scene più emozionali del film

&gt; -La partenza dal pianeta terra avviene col solito razzo a tre stadi, venti tonnellate di combustibile per mettere la nave scout in orbita per l’attracco alla stazione. Peccato che nel pianeta d’acqua la nave scout riparta come un razzetto cinese verso lo spazio, e NB: la gravita’ di quel pianeta e’ 1.3 volte quella terrestre.

Usano un razzo a stadi dalla Terra perchè possono risparmiare carburante che poi servirà per sfuggire alla gravità dei pianeti. Per quanto ci riguarda non sappiamo che tipo di combustibile usano i ranger, ma anche se in effetti è un pò irrealistico, secondo me ci può stare.

&gt; -Questa volta il token afro-american non e’ cazzuto e pragmatico, e’ sconfortato e depresso.Dopo essere rimasto per 23 ANNI in attesa del rientro dei nostri “ha fatto due dormitine” e gli e’ venuto il pizzetto un po’ brizzolo.Nessun cambio nel mood, e’ sempre afroamericano e se possibile ancora piu’ depresso.

Secondo me la scena in cui incontra nuovamente Brand e Cooper è una delle più riuscite del film. Più che il nero a me ha dato fastidio che Caine fosse uguale dopo 23 anni.

&gt; -Attraversato il wormhole arrivano idealmente in un altro sistema solare, ma anche in un’altra galassia.

&gt; -Il cliche’ dello spiegare l’esistenza della quarta/quinta dimensione con due crocette sul foglio, unite poi piegando il foglio, e’ qualcosa che ho visto fare nei peggiori film TV di fantascienza, dagli anni ‘60 agli ‘80. Non ultimo il compianto Ernest Borgnine in una produzione italoinglese finanziata dalla RAI, e ho detto tutto. Va da se’ che Borgnine ha la credibilita’ da scienziato come io avrei quella da majorette.

Già risposto.
&gt; -Il cameo di Matt Damon ricorda tanto quello di Tim Robbins ne “La Guerra dei Mondi”. Forzato, incastonato a martellate nella melassa del flow cinematografico fino a quel punto.Pure il cambio di registro e’ telefonato e si sgama da lontano un miglio. Come e perche' Romilly e la sua calvizie afro esplodano nel campo base e' un mistero.

Oddio, che fosse scontato che fosse il cattivo non lo direi, anche perchè Matt Damon ha recitato molto bene la parte. Era la persona giusta per il Dr.Mann? Mah, secondo me no, però non posso lamentarmi per come è finita. Il nero è morto perchè Mann aveva programmato il robot per autodistruggersi se avessero tentato di vedere i suoi dati falsificati.

&gt; -i tre simpatici robots hanno un design ancora piu’ anacronistico di quello con CPU valvolare del Pianeta Proibito. La prossima volta fateli direttamente a palla, o triangolo. E no, non fanno ridere, l’umorismo al 75% ha rotto, fai 10% e vai in sleep mode hasta pronto.

Onestamente penso che sei l'unico a cui non siano piaciuti...
&gt; -il “fantasma” e’ presto sgamato.Oh aspetta, vuole comunicare con la figlia? parlano di orizzonte degli eventi e paradossi spazio temporali? ce l’ho, bravo cooper che fai le ombre cinesi con la polvere.

Uhm?

&gt; -Le citta’ del futuro fanno schifo al razzo, sembra di stare dentro un rotolo di carta igienica con una torcia all’estremita’.

Ma perchè? hahah. 

&gt; -Gli esseri della quinta dimensione facciano poco i misteriosi, porgano patente e documenti e spieghino perche’ gli frega tanto della sorte del pianeta. Aspetta, vuoi dirmi che sono gli stessi esseri umani che intendono salvare loro stessi? me se AGISCONO nel futuro sono GIA’ SALVI, che gliene batte di quattro umani a tre dimensioni di unghie incarnite, sudore e freni inibitori rimossi dall’alcool?

Allora, gli essere della quinta dimensione sono gli umani del futuro. Il fatto è che non sarebbero vivi se non fosse stato per Cooper. So che sembra un paradosso, ma ci sono visioni del tempo che permettono questa cosa. Per esempio leggiti http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principio_di_autoconsistenza_di_Novikov . In pratica tutto è andato come andato perchè gli umani del futuro per sopravvivere necessitavano che Cooper facesse quello che ha fatto. E' un casino? Si, ma è sempre così con i viaggi nel tempo.

Moi je peux surtout parler des coréennes. Car ma femme est coréenne et je côtoie pas mal de coréen ou d'européens qui se sont mariés avec des coréenne.

Ce qui faut se dire, c'est que les gens ont beaucoup plus de pressions pour se marier.

Aussi une fois marié, c'est dans les normes que la femme reste à la maison et l'homme travail.

Se marier avec un étranger c'est pas très bien vu, les filles qui viennent de famille très stricte ne vont pas chercher à avoir une relation avec un étranger.

Les filles qui viennent de famille plus libérale ou qui serait intéressées par des occidentaux ne recherchent pas des gros machos.

Donc les chances qu'un macho qui cherche une femme soumises trouve une femme en Corée sont assez minces.

Ils s'imagine que j'ai trouvé un bonniche, alors que je m'occupe de beaucoup de tâches ménagères. je me pose jamais devant la tv quand je rentre du taff.

&gt;

&gt;A ___gireogi appa___ ([Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language): 기러기 아빠, literally ""goose dad"") is a [Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea) man who [works in Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_South_Korea) while his wife and children stay in an [English-speaking country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-speaking_country) for the sake of the children's [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_South_Korea).  The term is inspired by the fact that [geese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geese) are a species that [migrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration), just as the *gireogi appa* father must travel a great distance to see his family.  Estimates of the number of *gireogi appa* in South Korea range as high as 200,000 men.

Goa is in India and is a relatively small area that has been fairly rich because of trade. He was born into a rich colonist family in Mozambique and is of partial Goan descent.

When I talked about average I meant ethnic people who are native to that land. Not people who emigrated there. Portuguese culture definitely influenced these places heavily but the colonists and settlers were still the minority but since they were the ruling class they ran the country.

Wenn die Ansicht der betroffenen Personen wäre, dass sie es gut und richtig fänden, systematisch unterdrückt und benachteiligt zu finden, dann müsste ich den betroffenen hypothetischen Personen sagen, dass das keinesfalls richtig wäre. Wenn jemand meint, seine Würde sei nichts wert, dann stelle ich mich nicht über ihn wenn ich mitteile, dass er falsch liegt. 

&gt; Außerdem ist ""Intoleranz gegenüber Intoleranz"" hier vollkommen unangebracht. Sexismus nicht so existent und problematisch, wie du es erscheinen lässt.

Genau. Weil soziale Probleme und Intoleranz erst mal signifikantes Ausmaß haben müssen, um sie kritisieren zu können.

&gt; Che è come dire che, se si è accusati ingiustamente di qualcosa, non vale dire ""non è vero, non l'ho fatto"" solo perché molti criminali dicono la stessa cosa, mentendo per sperare di farla franca.
&gt; Cioè che l'abbia detto qualcuno a sproposito non lo rende automaticamente falso.
&gt; Nel mio caso, so benissimo quali sono le mie intenzioni e i miei pensieri (cioè che la responsabilità sia 100% dell'aggressore e 0% della vittima, che si è trovata in una situazione orribile), e l'ho detto e ribadito dall'inizio.

Intendevo che è una argomentazione dallo scarsissimo valore retorico. Hai detto una cosa in cui credi? Non rifugiarti nel suggerire che l'interlocutore è prevenuto, piuttosto argomentala in maniera più chiara.

&gt; &gt; Se usi le argomentazioni e la terminologia di chi vuole spostare la colpa sulla ragazza, perché ti stupisci se il tuo messaggio viene interpretato così?
&gt; Non mi stupisco, l'ho semplicemente preso come un dato di fatto.
&gt; Semplicemente è una constatazione di come un messaggio del tutto neutrale venga interpretato come a sfavore della vittima. Le cause sono diverse e comprensibili, ma il fenomeno c'è.

Evidentemente, se molti la giudicano in quella maniera, il messaggio non è “del tutto neutrale”; provo ad illustrare il punto di vista, senza voler parlare anche per altri ma credendo di esprimere un sentimento condiviso da quei molti: esprimere che la ragazza ha corso un rischio mentre si commenta un fatto di cronaca simile significa implicare che ci siano una serie di comportamenti “sicuri” a cui lei si sarebbe dovuta attenere per minimizzare il rischio. Quali siano questi comportamenti è fumoso (non andare in discoteca? niente sesso occasionale? non parlare con gli sconosciuti?), ma rimane che suggerire che le donne non adottino certi comportamenti ed evitino certe situazioni è esattamente la definizione di victim blaming.

&gt; Sarà una proiezione da parte mia, ma presumo che anche fra quei commentatori nessuno stia dicendo ""diamo uno sconto della pena all'egiziano perché è stata lei a cercarsela"".

E vorrei anche vedere. Ma il victim blaming è tale anche quando è molto più sottile di così.",0,1415910364,null,0,false,0,cm1o696,t3_2m674u,t1_cm1o696,t1_cm1dure,null,1426040852,0,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,0

The bone of contention is the fees GEMA is demanding from YouTube for royalties. YouTube has agreements with other collecting agencies in other countries (there was a similar dispute with the British agency PRS for Music, but that one was resolved), but can't come to an agreement with GEMA. So YouTube decided to block music videos from Germany.

Originally, YouTube put up a message implying that it was GEMA's fault, but GEMA complained bitterly, and YouTube has since changed it. The fact is, GEMA actually can't stop YouTube from broadcasting music -- GEMA has no such powers. GEMA's stance is that YouTube should continue to broadcast those videos, but pay the licencing fee into an escrow account pending the resolution of the dispute.

The ""freedom of the internet"" is still intact, in that there are other sites you can listen to the music or watch the videos -- ones that do have an agreement with GEMA.

false,Latvis,LATV,Latvia,"ATHENS, Greece — In the prosecutors' 697-page case file, he is known only as Witness E -- a Golden Dawn ex-member turned state's informant. And what he has to share about the neo-Nazi political party -- its ideology, its training methods, and its plans for the future -- is terrifying.


Golden Dawn recruited a butcher to train its members in the art of using a knife effectively, in order to ""neutralize opponents,"" Witness E told prosecutors. Party members participated in the mass slaughter of sheep in various farms around the Attica region, which encompasses Athens and its suburbs, to learn the best technique for ""striking directly at the jugular."" He'd heard, Witness E said, that the same butcher supplied guns to Golden Dawn members, as well. Other evidence prosecutors uncovered seem to back up his claim: The case file is littered with photos of members in military clothing carrying knives, swords, handguns, rifles, and, in one case, even a bazooka.
All this training was ""in preparation to overthrow the Greek government,"" Witness E suggested to prosecutors -- a jarring reminder of how little the Greek public truly understood the operational capabilities of Golden Dawn, or what the party even aimed to be. ""They kept telling us that we'll break into the parliament with tanks,"" he said.
The prosecutors' report -- a copy of which was obtained by Foreign Policy -- was prepared in advance of the trials of dozens of members of Golden Dawn on charges ranging from assault to human trafficking to murder. On the eve of the first of the trials, slated to start mid-November, the investigation has revealed a group that had bigger, scarier ambitions that even their most cynical enemies imagined -- and, despite its revolutionary goals, had far closer ties to the ruling coalition than much of the public realized.


Founded in the mid-1980s, Golden Dawn originally started out as a small fringe discussion group -- one that only later developed electoral ambitions. Even after entering politics, Golden Dawn remained a bit player for much of its existence, in some elections winning less than 1 percent of the vote. Its breakthrough came in 2010, in the wake of the global financial crisis. With unemployment rates that would eventually reach as high as 28 percent in November 2013, the group rode a wave of government-directed anger, scoring its first electoral breakthrough in 2010 when one of its candidates won a seat on the Athens City Council. In the following years, the group continued to generate headlines for its violent attacks on immigrants and leftists, its fiery nationalistic rhetoric and, finally, for its electoral success: Golden Dawn sent shockwaves throughout Europe in 2012, when it won 18 seats in parliament with nearly 7 percent of the vote.


The party's share of support has now fallen to around 6 percent in the polls -- its lowest since it 2012, but likely still enough to win more than 10 seats in parliament for a group that, according to prosecutors, was less a political party than a full-fledged criminal organization.

The downfall of Golden Dawn began with the September 2013 stabbing death of a Greek anti-fascist musician named Pavlos Fyssas by man named Giorgos Roupakias. Roupakias initially denied he was a Golden Dawn member, but photos and videos of him at party events quickly demonstrated otherwise. The crackdown that came next was swift and unprecedented: All of Golden Dawn's MPs and more than 60 party members are facing a range of criminal charges, and more than 30 members of the party leadership are currently detained, including the party's founder and historical leader Nikolaos Michaloliakos.

The police operation against Golden Dawn may have started with a murder investigation, but photos, videos, and phone records in the case file show party members were involved in a web of criminal activities that ranged from possession of firearms and explosives -- illegal in Greece -- to money laundering, running protection rings, human trafficking, and aggravated assault. Several members face charges related to the stabbing, including one MP, Ioannis Lagos, who prosecutors say directed the murder. There is also at least one case of sexual assault in the offices of the Sparta branch of Golden Dawn and was reportedly covered up by local officials.


Golden Dawn's party leaders have long officially denied any link to Nazism, despite appearing to draw inspiration from Nazis for their imagery, songs, and rhetoric. But videos and photos obtained by the authorities from confiscated laptops and hard drives belonging to various party members and officials appear to belie these claims. They show party leaders dressed in S.S. uniforms, giving the Nazi salute. In one of the videos, Swastika-draped Golden Dawn members train with firearms, under the instructions of MP Ilias Kasidiaris and other elected officials. Another shows groups of activists in paramilitary uniforms marching, their faces covered with motorcycle helmets. In at least one case, these paramilitary-style groups reportedly participated in attacks against immigrants in 2011, with Kasidiaris and press officer Ilias Panagiotaros barking orders from the sidelines. But the most damning evidence concerns the days leading up the death of the anti-fascist musician on Sept. 18, 2013, and its aftermath.


In a Sept. 13, 2013, text message exchange between Golden Dawn MP Lagos and the leader of the local Golden Dawn office in Nikaia, a suburb of Athens, Lagos appears to sign off on an attack on a group of leftists affiliated with the shipyard unions of Perama, a port city west of Athens. ""The commies are in for a beating in Perama,"" Lagos's text reads. ""Take 30 guys and drop by."" Around 50 party members carried out the attack that night, which sent nine people to the hospital. No one was immediately arrested after the violence. 


One of those attacked confirmed to me earlier in the year that ""they were hitting us with sticks that had nails in the end. They were looking to kill someone.""
A week later, a chain of command that led right to the top of Golden Dawn appears to have sanctioned, or at least known about, the attack on Fyssas, the musician. Having failed to cow the leftists a week earlier, union officials say they believe the attack was staged to solidify the party's dominance in the shipyards of Perama and in Nikaia as a whole. Prosecutors have mapped out a web of phone calls that show party leader Michaloliakos himself was contacted both before and immediately after the stabbing. Michaloliakos is currently being charged with belonging to a criminal organization.


The sitting government, led by Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, has been quick to celebrate its role in saving Greece from the neo-Nazi threat, but in bringing down Golden Dawn, the government has exposed itself to a series of potentially embarrassing revelations about just how close the relationship between New Democracy, the senior coalition member in parliament, and the neo-Nazis had become.",0,1415911107,null,0,false,0,cm1oli8,t3_2m7pht,t1_cm1oli8,t3_2m7pht,null,1426040656,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5
false,Latvis,LATV,Latvia,"A few months before he was detained, Kasidiaris -- the 33-year-old once dubbed ""the playboy of the Greek far-right"" by VICE who, before the arrest, was positioning himself as the natural heir to Michaloliakos -- attempted to blackmail a prominent member of Greece's New Democracy party, the senior partner in Greece's coalition government. Kasidiaris released a tape in which he appeared to be discussing details of the case and possible outcomes with New Democracy's cabinet secretary, Takis Baltakos a few months after the arrests. On the tape, Baltakos can be heard telling Kasidiaris that ""there is no evidence against you"" repeatedly and telling him that the crackdown was politically motivated -- that Prime Minister Samaras was worried that Golden Dawn's popularity was a threat to his conservative ruling coalition. The scandal led to Baltakos's resignation.

Even so, it now looks like the links between Baltakos and the Golden Dawn were gravely underestimated. According to the most recent revelations, from further recordings Golden Dawn itself has leaked and phone records intercepted by government investigators, Baltakos was more than a sympathetic ear. Not only did he publicly suggest that New Democracy form a coalition with Golden Dawn in order to attract right-wing voters, but he was also in contact with Golden Dawn's MPs, directing them how to vote on crucial matters in parliament, essentially aligning them with the coalition's goals.

A series of text messages between an unnamed aide acting as a link between Baltakos and Kasidiaris contain instructions for various votes on matters ranging from drug policy to military schools. They also show Baltakos sent his ""congratulations"" on the behavior of the party's MPs in the parliament, including on one instance when a Golden Dawn MP, during an argument on the floor, called members of the opposition party Syriza ""goats"" and ""filthy"" people before getting kicked out of the chamber. Throughout, the text messages show a familiarity between the two politicians: ""Takis ... came in and wants to see you"" one of the messages read, using the secretary's first name. The problem is that Baltakos was not just anybody inside New Democracy: He was close with Prime Minister Samaras and his personal advisors.
New Democracy has always had mixed feelings toward Golden Dawn, an ambivalence driven largely by the view of a ""specific nuclei"" within the party, said Yiannis Mavris, a Greek political analyst, in an interview earlier this year -- people like Baltakos and other close advisors to the prime minister who see them less as thugs and more as misguided comrades. 

The two parties competed for some of the same voters, and New Democracy saw Golden Dawn as a threat on its right flank. But for some, like Baltakos, the far right was a natural extension to New Democracy, Greece's main center-right party. Reports in the Greek mainstream media now suggest that Baltakos, who is still in public life, is trying to set up a new, ""serious"" Golden Dawn, potentially with Ilias Kasidiaris at the helm if he's acquitted, and the co-operation of Michaloliakos's brother, Athens lawyer Takis Michalolias -- who the same reports suggest, has been quietly recruiting new members since at least last year. Golden Dawn was already trying to present a new, respectable face during the 2014 European elections, where the party managed to garner 9.4 percent of the vote. During those elections, the party ran retired Army officials -- in contrast with their parliamentary slate which included heavy metal musicians and bouncers.
The political consequences of the trials may be far-reaching. With the Greek economy showing only marginal improvements, and with the opposition calling for early elections next year, Samaras seems likely to try to capitalize on the unfolding prosecution. The prime minister has boasted of being the man that brought down Golden Dawn, dubbing them ""Nazi sympathizers"" in a talk earlier this year and denouncing their ideology, saying ""blood, sacrifices and our memory of history are violently insulted by those who today bear the symbols of Nazism.""
""New Democracy can't back down,"" said Dimitris Psarras, a veteran investigative reporter and expert on the Greek far-right. ""It's profiting from what's happening.""

But the trials also threaten to expose further links between New Democracy and the far right. Samaras so far has refused to answer questions on both Baltakos and other instances in which members of his party appeared to be sympathizing with the Golden Dawn and its voters. (Just this past week, one Samaras advisor told the newspaper Kathimerini that New Democracy should consider opening up to far-right groups.) That former Minister of Public Order and Citizen Protection Nikos Dendias was sitting on 33 cases involving various Golden Dawn members, but only filed charges against them after his hand was forced by the September murder, has also called into question Samaras's commitment to stamping out the right wing.
But whether the trials, which will run concurrently, beginning with an assault case today and running through January, will succeed is a different matter entirely. There are ""serious gaps"" in the evidence backing the charges that Golden Dawn was a criminal organization, Psarras said. Should the trials go badly for the prosecution, they could easily backfire, he said, winning  sympathy for the party. The trials could also take place in a particularly politicized climate, he said, should there be early elections; some Greeks might see the trials less as a means of delivering justice, and more as a political power play.
For Greece, the next few months are crucial. Golden Dawn's main body of activists has mostly gone silent. But smaller attacks are taking place across Athens, against LGBT activists and leftists, some allegedly by Golden Dawn supporters still roaming the streets. Whether this low-level violence eventually fades away and disappears -- or whether it ramps up again -- depends very much on whether prosecutors succeed where political officials failed: in disbanding what had grown into the biggest neo-Nazi party in Europe.",0,1415911119,null,0,false,0,cm1olrg,t3_2m7pht,t1_cm1olrg,t1_cm1oli8,null,1426040652,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Every video that YouTube doesn't play is costing them money. Of course they'd just love for Google to continue to incur licensing fees while they use their quasi-monopoly on music rights to extort an agreement. The fact that every video YouTube doesn't play is costing GEMA money is the only leverage Google has in these negotiations.

    Compatibilmente con le mie conoscenze, capacità ed il mio limitato tempo disponibile, descriverò qui, in spirito COSTRUTTIVO, se potran esser utili anche per evitar la CATASTROFE, fatti, esperienze, reazioni, riflessioni, PERTINENTI, sotto sintetici TITOLI rappresentativi. 

    Per il Titolo di OGGI, qui sopra, evoco questi fatti - eventi - comportamenti:i dell'Impero Romano, i Tedeschi di allora, dopo aver ottenuto dai Comandanti romani
      quel che volevano, fingendo disponibilità ad altre trattative, ATTIRARONO
      in una TRAPPOLA ed IMBOSCATA enormi Legioni multi-etniche romane, MASSACRANDOLE
      interamente, senza alcun altro esempio all'epoca di una tal BRUTALITà;

2.  - Negli Atti. scritti e Documenti di fine 1400 e prima metà del 1500, anche durante le furenti ribellioni,
       rivolte e sanguinose repressioni dei Contadini contro i Signori dell'epoca e del luogo, pur 
       dipendendo e dovendo risponder all'Imperatore Carlo V che li aveva lì insediati, di fatto hanno
       quasi sempre protetto i loro Popoli e Letterati schierati CONTRO la Chiesa di Roma, NON 
       adeguandosi ad Ordini ed Editti dallo stesso Imperatore, dal Papa o da suoi Cardinali.
           Poco e raramente applicarono ai propri Sudditi le pene corporali (=taglio di dito, mano, orecchio,
       lingua, ecc., pur previste per quei reati nel Cod. Imperiale ""CAROLINA"" (=dal Nome
       dell'Imperatore);

3. - Al SOFFERTO Concilio di Trento, i Luterani NON indietreggiarono un passo dalle loro posizioni
      e pretese;

4. - Il Tedesco che in Germania organizzò i Servizio Postale DIVENNE rapidamente RICCHISSIMO: 
      maligni scrissero che contenuti di missive venivan letti prima di arrivar, per cui il moderno reato di 
      Insider Trading potrebbe esser identificato come MODERNA ""Versione hi-tech 2000"";

5. - La nascita e lo sviluppo dell'Aristocrazia e del primo Capitalismo in Centro - Europa ha sempre
      avuto Famiglie disciplinate all'interno ed all'esterno, da ELEVATO RIGORE ETICO, MORALE, 
      RELAZIONALE;

6. - Dalla Lega Anseatica e dagli Staterelli tedeschi che NON riconoscevano le Monete degli altri Stati 
      tedeschi confinanti i Tedeschi apprendono che esser piccoli e/o deboli si SOCCOMBE e che, 
      invece,
      UNITI si vince e ci si IMPONE, concetti e FOCUS al centro delle Opere di Filosofi, Letterati, Institori, 
      Regnanti, Politici, Militari, Scienziati, Ricercatori, Aziende, Managers, ecc., TEDESCHI degli ultimi 3 
     Secoli, fino ad OGGI;

7.  - UNITI, COMPATTI, con una tal forza d'urto, vogliono DOMINARE sempre ed ovunque.
       In assenza di Principi di Etica CATTOLICA, nei Quadri, Libri, Discorsi, Lezioni,Uffici, Bar, Consigli di 
      Amministrazione, Cene, Congressi, Viaggi di Comitive, ecc, è POSITIVO solamente Chi si 
      AFFERMA e NON vengono presi in considerazione gli Altri, perdenti o quasi.

8. - Si è così determinati e protagonisti nella 1° e 2° Guerra Mondiale, DISTRUGGENDO il Continente,
      perdendole ENTRAMBE: si sussurra che parti di MOLTE VALIGIE di BANCONOTE, LINGOTTI 
      d'ORO, OPERE D'ARTE, DOCUMENTI segreti, ecc., i Tedeschi che li rubavan negli Stati da loro
      occupati li RISERVASSERO espressamente per comprar silenzio e benevolenza, anche di Cronisti
      e Storici postumi, affinchè ""NON appaia MAI che la Germania ed i Tedeschi sono imperfetti,
      sbagliano anche loro, posson esser delinquenti comuni, criminali di Guerra, incompetenti, ecc. ..."";

9. - sia nella 1° che nella 2° Guerra Mondiale, pur PERDENDOLE, i TEDESCHI hanno DISTRUTTO
      il Continente ed ammazzato ed incenerito DECINE di MILIONI di Persone INNOCENTI. 
          Per 2 volte, pochi anni dopo, dicon che NON posson pagar i DANNI di Guerra riconosciuti e 
      sottoscritti al momento di ogni Resa: i Governanti dei Popoli e Stati distrutti e Creditori, seppur
      poveri ed in difficoltà (v. ad es. la Grecia e l'Italia nel 1956, come pure Altri), guidati da un'Etica
      Cristiano-Cattolica, CANCELLANO e RINUNCIANO al 50% dei rispettivi crediti di Guerra /=Debito
      tedesco;

10. - Ad inizio anni 2000 la Germania NON rispetta le Regole pattuite e sottoscritte nei Trattati 
        dell'Un. Europea: ai timidi rilievi di Esperti e Politici dell'epoca, la Germania risponde 
        disinvoltamente e sprezzantemente che prima di tutto ci sono i Tedeschi, la ricostruzione della 
        Germania ri-unificata, ecc.

SINTESI: io, Germania, sono SOPRA TUTTI Voi !   Vi ho DISTRUTTO Paesi, Stati, Aziende, Economie

false,SomebodyReasonable,NETH,The Netherlands,"Okay, a few more things: I feel Snowden's assessment of GCHQ is fair, and I'm actually about as pissed off at GCHQ as I am at NSA. Mind you, when it comes to our own service, I have been uneasy and upset with their massive tapping for much longer. The Snowden leaks are fairly recent and new in that light.

What might surprise you is that oftentimes, when I'm reading articles about the NSA, I will reason, without really wondering if that's appropriate, as if I'm a US citizen whose 4th amendment rights were just violated. Therefore, I would get upset even if this surveillance mess were limited to the US population. It's exactly because the U.S. has such astronomical surveillance and other military capabilities that it would be utterly catastrophic if that were to be unleashed on its own citizenry.

And frankly.. I get the feeling that with an ever increasing proliferation of nuclear weapons, countries are looking for new targets to engage, since open war with each other becomes less and less feasible. It's as if the state is looking for something to flex its muscles against. Increasingly, I'm seeing states self-designated as democratic direct totalitarian capabilities *inward*.

&gt; When the GCHQ's activities were made public most of the comments were jokes like ""we still got it""

I am actually livid at GCHQ over their ""OP Socialist"" operation. The U.K. seems utterly lost right now when it comes to putting boundaries on government intrusion into peoples' lives. Free speech is under assault, CCTV is omnipresent, freedom of the press is under assault, infiltration of activist groups is rampant and methods used are absolutely scandalous (sexual relationships, etc. ) ... and part of that, in my opinion is a love of authority and conformism the U.K. and the Netherlands share.

The Netherlands, I believe, has more taps per capita than the U.S. ... but these are actual, formal criminal investigation wiretaps. Still... It's evident to me that something is very wrong with such an abnormally high per capita tap rate. Oftentimes, lawyer-client communications are scooped up in the process, not properly deleted, and this has led to mistrials several times, publicized in the local media.

When it comes to five and nine eyes partners acquiring access to U.S. datasets, there is simply no mass surveillance by any EU country of U.S. citizens. That, the USG will do itself. However, the USG is also interested in foreign internal telecommunications and for Europe, much NSA processing of these massive data streams is done in Germany.


Here is a list of NSA facilities in Germany:

http://www.spiegel.de/media/media-34115.pdf

Every facility with no closing date is still open. So, while the 6-7 bases I mentioned earlier are the big ones, this list contains approximately 90 (!) surveillance bases, now with the smaller ones included. And that is the NSA in Germany alone.

(2) Countries where a large percentage of the population speaks English (because that's the language professionals most commonly study at school and university, be they from Germany, Spain, or Romania).

In short, northwest and northern Europe. Especially the UK and Ireland.

Germany is as First World as the UK, but it is still firmly German speaking - unlike the much more Anglicized Swedes or Danes - so the inflow/outflow balance there is a lot more equal.

Perhaps the only major surprise here is the Netherlands. According to the above model, it should be getting quite a few net specialist immigrants. The Netherlands are very First World and probably have the highest English language competency in Europe alongside Sweden (except the UK and Ireland).

false,mkvgtired,null,null,"&gt; Therefore, I would get upset even if this surveillance mess were limited to the US population. It's exactly because the U.S. has such astronomical surveillance and other military capabilities that it would be utterly catastrophic if that were to be unleashed on its own citizenry.

I agree, and personally I think the US is doing much more harm than good with it elsewhere. Despite the fact wikileaks has shown the Pakistani government is not only participating in the planning of drone strikes, it is ordering them, I think the situation needs to change. That is just one example.

Those lawsuits against the NSA are arguing constitutional violations, so it will be likely it gets in front of the Supreme Court. Usually they get things right, but it is not always a guarantee. There is always a legislative option which I would prefer, but trust me, many people are concerned about the constitutionality of that program.

&gt;The U.K. seems utterly lost right now when it comes to putting boundaries on government intrusion into peoples' lives.

Which is a shame. They are the ones who framed the institutions that govern the Anglosphere, and are still a critical member of it. With things like the NSA programs I see the US following a similar path. Brits will protest things like tuition increases, etc. but the articles I have seen on GCHQ protests have reported only a few people showed up. Compare this to thousands that have shown up to NSA protests in the US, not to mention, major tech companies taking part. It seems nobody seems to think this is a problem in the UK. 

&gt;The Netherlands, I believe, has more taps per capita than the U.S.

If I remember right it is the highest in the developed world. Perhaps legislating changes at the EU level would be the most effective, although I am not sure it would gain support from the member states, at least not the powerful ones. 

&gt;list contains approximately 90 (!) surveillance bases, now with the smaller ones included. And that is the NSA in Germany alone.

This is clearly not a good thing, but it supports my point. The US presence there did not get this size without the support of the German government. Maybe I am cynical, but the US probably offered to pick up the tab if Germany allowed it access to its infrastructure and access to the gathered information. I fully support the US leaving countries where its presence is not wanted by the population. I fully supported the removal of US troops and assets from Europe, which would have hopefully included intelligence. But it seems that has been reversed.
