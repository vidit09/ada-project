So who to ""blame"", in the sense of someone eating losses?

* Corrupt politicians and/or Greek bankers.  Well, I think that pretty much everyone can agree that it would be a good idea to go after these people.  Greece is the organization that can do this, though.  Any funds Greece recovers from them are certainly fair for Greece to have.

* The Greek people as a whole.  Certainly a lot of them didn't see much of the direct benefit, but part of national sovereignty is that *you* get to choose your leaders.  Germany doesn't get to say ""This government consists of a bunch of asshats.  We're appointing a new Greek government.""  Because that leadership is acting as the representative of Greek people, controlling their pocketbook and has access to their reputation and credit.

    The Greek people *could* take that away, and, for example, establish a constitutional principle that the Greek state may not take out and will refuse to honor debts at all or over, say, 10% of GDP in the future.  But to date, they gave their government that power, and they didn't demand sufficient scrutiny...and the people they selected to manage their reputation and funds turned out to be a poor choice.

    It's *possible* that Greece could vote to surrender sovereignty to Germany and let Germany establish their government and that Germany would consider that a sufficient guarantee to provide funds or other things, but I'm pretty sure that Greece doesn't want to do that (and no surprise).  As a result, the people that are likely going to be on the hook for a lot of this are going to be the Greek people.  They're the ones with the power to select governments, and only if there is real, meaningful incentive to choose governments that don't abuse their country's credit will reputable governments wind up.

* Creditors, Germany and other.  Well, they *already* agreed to take some of the hit, as Greece isn't gong to be paying back all they originally promised to pay back.  But they don't want to just have the same thing happen again, and I think that's reasonable.  Nor is it reasonable to specially-blame Germany: you can buy Greek bonds if you want, and I assume that you aren't really thrilled about the idea either.

Germany can't set Greece's judicial system (for prosecuting corruption) or its government (for choosing people who may or may not be corrupt) or directly impact things other than saying ""I will or will not personally lend you money, and if I do lend you money, these are the terms attached.""  If anyone else in the world is willing to lend at a better rate, Germany has no influence here.

All of the arguments I've heard to try to move the blame away from that basic allocation aren't very convincing:

""But corrupt companies, including German companies, extended bribes.""  Yes, but that will *always* be a risk from companies and individuals *anywhere* in the world.  You are going to have to have leaders that, either via fear of credible prosecution or whatnot, are unwilling to take bribes.

""But this will impose hardship, and that will hurt creditors.""  Yes, but I suspect that the creditors have already estimated how much pain they take.

""But it would be a fine, generous thing to give Greece money.""  Okay, but it's a little less-pleasant if its *your* savings on the line.  As I pointed out earlier, are *you* buying Greek bonds?

""Greece deserves the benefit of the doubt.""  Greece already received the benefit of the doubt once, and severely-burned its creditors.  Now creditors don't want to lend more money without terms being attached that will make it more-likely that they get paid back.  Eventually, Greece can rebuild trust.",0,1419491907,null,0,false,0,cn4vh3b,t3_2q27y1,t1_cn4vh3b,t1_cn2d3qf,null,1425225418,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Is that so hard to understand? Advocate against the bad thing itself, not against something else that really has no connection to the bad thing. Don't throw out the child with the bathwater. 

The ""all religious people are commiting insanities thing"" only exists in your mind. Yes, some people do commit insanities. Some use religion as an excuse to justify it. Some use something else. Plenty of religious people are just normal people, and don't commit any insanities, at all. If you'd actually know some of those people, you'd know that, too.

false,wadcann,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; I have noticed soldier/marines/whatever with machine guns (I do not know what a machine gun is, actually. things capable of shooting more than once a second for a couple minutes)

Almost certainly assault rifles.  Broadly-speaking:

* An [assault rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_rifle) can shoot either in either semi-automatic mode (squeeze trigger, one shot is fired) or automatic mode (squeeze trigger, shots keep being fired).  This is the standard, basic infantryman weapon in armies today.

    These typically have 20 to 30 round magazines, though that's not a hard requirement.

    If you see a soldier lugging a rifle-looking weapon around domestically, this is very probably what he's carrying.

    Some examples of current assault rifles: the [M16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M16_rifle) (United States), the [C7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_Canada_C7_rifle) (Canada), the [SA80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SA80) (United Kingdom), the [G36](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch_G36) (Germany).

    The M16 weighs 3.26kg.

* A [machine gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_gun) is designed to have some degree of *sustained* automatic fire.  Typically the barrel can be quickly changed or there is a cooling system or at least more cooling capability, so that the barrel does not overheat.  A machine gun is typically heavier than an assault rfile.  A machine gun typically (though this is not a hard requirement) has the ability to feed from a larger magazine, like a belt.  Machine guns typically (though not always) have bipods or tripods to stabilize them while firing continuously.

    The [M249](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M249_light_machine_gun) is a light machine gun used by the United States (7.5kg) and the [M240](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M240_machine_gun) is a medium machine gun used by the United States (12.3kg).

    Heavy machine guns also exist.  These tend to live on tripod or are mounted on vehicles rather than lugged around; these typically can fire continuously without barrel changes and shoot .50 caliber bullets.  They typically have multiple men operating them. They will normally need to be broken down to be hauled by their crew.  The [Browning M2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browning_M2) is used by the United States (58kg).",0,1419498518,null,0,false,0,cn4x1r3,t3_2q7i3z,t1_cn4x1r3,t1_cn3p9ja,null,1425224685,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Oh and the English Civil War

For the Empire, 1858 when British India was transferred to the Crown? The death of Queen Victoria instead, then you can fit it under longest reigning Queen dies? 

I think the best bet for the empire though is 1918 after WW1, we just won WW1, and the empire is the largest it's ever been (Well in around 1922) but the power of the country is obviously on the decline. We also pass the Representation of the People Act 1918, enfranchising women over the age of 30 who met minimum property qualifications. With that you can get rid of the Great Reform Act, as that is another act of becoming a proper democracy, and replace it with something else important?

I think those would be better to show than the death of King Edward VII.

Edit: I'll give it a shot myself for the England (none before then)/The United Kingdom, basically just using yours. So many I want to use.

(Approx) 927 AD - Athelstan becomes the first king of England, uniting the many kingdoms.

1066 AD - Founding of the Norman Monarchy, William is crowned on Christmas Day

1284 AD - The Principality of Wales is fully annexed by Edward I and becomes a client state of England.

1485 AD - Richard III defeated at Bosworth Field by Henry Tudor (Henry VII), setting up the Tudor Dynasty for over a century, leading to the break with Rome under Henry VIII and shaping religious conflict in the British Isles for centuries to come. Also leads to the Tudor reconquest of Ireland, bringing it fully under the British Crown.

1688 - King James is replaced by William of Orange in the Glorious Revolution, cementing Protestant dominance

1707 - England and Scotland are officially joined by the act of Union

1815 - Napoleon is defeated at Waterloo, ending the Napoleonic Wars, setting the scene for Britain's rise to a great Empire

1918 - WW1 has ended in the defeat of the Central Powers, leading to the transfer of colonies to the Triple Entente. Makes the British Empire the largest it has ever been, though its power is obviously on the decline. The passing of the Representation of the People Act 1918, for the first time enfranchising women over the age of 30 who met minimum property qualifications, and all males over the age of 21.

1922 - The Irish Free State is founded and Ireland leaves the United Kingdom after the War of Independence ended in 1921, largely as a result of many centuries of mismanagement, brutal rule and religious strife. Northern Ireland immediately opts out of this.

1945 - Nazi Germany is defeated but Britain is exhausted and a minor player compared to the USA and USSR by the end of the War. This will lead to the end of the Empire.

So, the dullness is on your side :-)

However, there are Muslims in Germany that force their wife behind Tschadors, force-marry daughters, or kill daughters because of alleged immoral behavior. There's a big movement to implement the Sharia in Britain. They are much bigger than those in Germany that want to implement a caliphate. 

Sure, not all Muslims do this. In fact, the vast (!) majority of the Muslims in Germany aren't doing this. But their religion calls for those actions.

But their teachings (both Quoran and Hadiths) asks them to do various things that are atrocities in our eyes. Killing polytheists. Oppressing people of the book (Christians and Jews). Kill people that are actively against Islam. Killing people that converted from Islam to another religion. Taking away rights from woman. Allowing slavery (even today!).

And nowhere did I say that *all* Muslims (in Germany or outside) want this. Muslim != Muslim, for a start.

I'm unimaginably relieved to see you use that phrasing. That's all I've been asking for!! You differentiated between ""the organizers"" and ""every single other participant of the protests"". There can be more than one group, even though they all come together. Even on an individual level, there can be overlap and disagreement about certain things at the same time.  
If only I had read this line right away, then I could've abstained from responding to all the other parts to such length again.  

I think you do understand it afterall. Which is great (and I'm sorry that I didn't trust, but doubted you). But why didn't your posts make room for that earlier? ://


&amp;nbsp;

----

&gt; The act of participating in a demonstration is a deliberate endorsement of the message of the demonstration.

It is an endorsement of **a**, **one** message, **one** facet of the demonstration. It's the difference between moral responsibility, which you correctly talked about earlier, and the differing motives for doing so.

I really can't put it more clearly than that. Sharing responsibility for something is not the same as agreeing with every aspect of that something happening. People can have differentiated opinions and be aware of good and bad parts of things they do.

&gt; My position is that I don't have to gather the positions of all demonstrators. 

And my position is that that makes you as bad as them, that that's exactly the same of unconstructive stereotyping they're rightfully being criticized for.

&gt; One might claim that all they ask for is to punish ""criminal"" asylum seekers and ""extremist"" Muslims. 

One may also claim that some of them ask for punishing asylum seekers, some ask for other things and some ask for both. You keep bunching them all up without any sort of differentiated analysis whatsoever. Why? Why is it so hard for you to accept that individuals exist, that doing something for one aspect of it is not the same as agreeing with all aspects of said thing?  
Think of examples/activities other than protests to help illustrate this: There are bad parts about alternative energy, namely that they mostly don't provide base-load power in absence of sufficient energy storage, that they're unreliable during nighttime or calm, that decentralized production of such a degree requires a smart grid which we don't currently have - yet we still use those technologies. People will hardly agree with every single policy of a political party, and yet they still have to one for one party if they want any sort of representation, so they have to compromise, bite the bullet so to speak.

&gt; This is not a question of law. PEGIDA does not break the law. Their position just conflicts with the values enshrined in the GG.

Is the GG not law? This sounds a bit like splitting the difference in this case.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;And this message is incompatible with the value enshrined in section 4 GG (religious freedom).

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Artikel 4

&gt; (1) Die Freiheit des Glaubens, des Gewissens und die Freiheit des religiösen und weltanschaulichen Bekenntnisses sind unverletzlich.

As an intellectual exercise, try (even if only for yourself) to assess more than just one demand of the people there and see if you can identify 1-2 that would be compatible with that. This should help you overcome the notion that ""all of these thousands of protesters are the same type of Neo Nazis, perfect clones and cut from the same stone"".

&gt; (2) Die ungestörte Religionsausübung wird gewährleistet.  

What are the limitations for that part? Is US/French style separation of church and state compatible with that? Sounds like an undue endorsement of religion, since there's nothing there detailing how far it reaches. Quite obviously free speech should be protected in perfectly public and perfectly private settings, but there've got to be at least some exceptions, right?

It's not because they're rich that can't discriminised against. I have the feeling that a lot of people support this tax out of envy and not out of reason. 


Is working a few years longer really that big of a problem? People have been gotten older and the quality and longevity of life wil only increase, so it's only natural that we should work longer. Besides at the moment we have the problem that there are way too many old people compared to young people. We will have to work longer if we want to be able to give everyone a decent retirement.


This is my opinion and the basics of my argument. You really should state your opinion and arguments instead of insulting me. Like I said it's immature and gets us nowhere.

If people were much more restricted on having unoccupied property instead of selling it or renting it out, then owners will be much more inclined to make sure their properties aren't unoccupied and put them on the market in some way.

In sostanza, alle istanza 'ecologiche' iniziali di alcuni 'ambientalisti' locali si sono poi aggregati movimenti cosiddetti 'antagonisti' prima di tutta Italia, poi di varie parti d'Europa.

Se non hai uno scopo e una ragione di vita tendi a cercarti (e a trovati) un Nemico da combattere per giustificare la tua esistenza; in questo caso il Nemico e' il TAV, ma questo e' solo un pretesto: poteva essere il Ponte sullo Stretto, o le pale eoliche in Molise, non sarebbe cambiato nulla. 

Siccome il Nemico e' Malvagio per definizione, combatterlo giustifica tutto: dall'incendio, al sabotaggio, allo smerdare muri in tutta Italia. 

La cosa inizialmente poco comprensibile e' perche' tanta gente si sia aggregata intorno ad una causa cosi' palesemente irrilevante: che senso ha protestare contro una ferrovia invece che - per dire - la crescente disuguaglianza sociale, o il succitato Ponte sullo Stretto, o le varie [autostrade nel deserto](https://it.notizie.yahoo.com/brebemi-il-lusso-di-un-131953551.html).. 

Poi capisci che in fondo la causa non conta: e' solo un prestesto. E bravo anche Grillo che, sempre onnipresente quando c'e' da cacare fuori dal vaso, ha contribuito a dare visibilita' e legittimita' a un 'movimento' che sempre piu' ricorda gruppetti vandalo-terroristici degli anni '70: gruppetti che non hanno prodotto nulla se non un po' di morti ammazzati.

false,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;I'm pretty sure rich people pay the same amount of taxes as all the others.

If people buy a shovel with their money and work with that shovel, they are taxed on the profits in the normal progressive tax rate (25-50%) and have to pay social contributions. Right now, if people buy stock with their money and don't work, they aren't taxed at all on the profits. So it's the current situation that is unfair to working people.

&gt;Why do they need to pay more money because they own more? That doesn't make any sense. 

Because the cost of living is the same for everyone. If we raise taxes on everyone, it will cut into necessary expenses for the lower income people, while the rich won't even notice it in their lives. So it's better to tax the rich more highly, since that gets the highest yield.

&gt;I really wonder why everyone seems to hate the rich.

Why would a higher taxation be a sign of hate? If you ask someone that is 2m10 long to take something off a high shelf because it's trivial for him and a problem for you, do you hate that long guy?

&gt;Besides, money finds always a way. If you implement wealth taxes, the rich will move out or find ways to pass these.

Enforceability is relevant, but your defeatism is just and excuse not to do it. Experiences in other countries show that less than a percent of wealth moves abroad (and most of it to neighbouring countries, for practical reasons).

&gt;Sure big companies will have no problems whatever the state decides, but think about the small companies.

Recently he also cracked down on Gulen's media and arrested the main editor of the Zaman newspaper In this case, the reason why Erdogan is likely so sensitive about the word ""thief"" is because it alludes to the corruption scandal. This doesn't justify his actions but I think it is important to understand what his motif really is. Erdogan increasingly acts like a paranoid dictator that sees threats to his rule everywhere.

I'd probably plan on four or five days in Munich.  Aside from stuff in the city, it is easy to take day trips to Salzburg in Austria (http://www.salzburg.info/en/).  You could also easily reach places like Bad Tölz (http://www.bad-toelz.de/en.html), Andechs Abbey (http://www.andechs.de/nc/en.html), and Dachau concentration camp.  One of my favorite hostels ever is in Munich (http://www.wombats-hostels.com/munich/).

There are lots of trains that head direct to Regensburg from Munich, and from Regensburg, there are also a couple of direct connections to Berlin.  Regensburg is great for a day or so, and I am assuming that your friend will play tour guide.  : ) 

If you're hoping to experience a little nature in Berlin, think about stuff like http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/nov/05/walking-berlin-wall-trail-germany  Berlin is massive and should take care of all of your art and nightlife needs; if you tell us a little more about what you are looking for there, then maybe we can give you some more specific tips.

I'd also wait until May if you can.  This year, the first semi-warm week was the first week of April; last year, I flew back from the US on the last Sunday in March and it was snowing.

Also, Munich drags out the Oktoberfest tents for a spring beer festival, too.

Was wäre so falsch daran, wenn ein Journalist, der gute Arbeit geleistet und dafür vom Konsumenten durch die Umgehung ausbeuterischer Vertriebswege enorme Mengen an Geld bekommen hat, dieses für Luxusautos ausgäbe? Hätte er für gute Arbeit nicht auch Luxus verdient?

Das vorliegende Problem ist, dass selbst 20 Jahre nach Popularisierung des WWW es noch immer kein tragfähiges Geschäftsmodell für Online-Journalismus gibt, das in der Lage wäre, mit konventionellem Papierjournalismus mitzuhalten.  Wir warten immer noch auf die Erfüllung dieses mit der digitalen Revolution verbundenen Versprechens.  Stattdessen haben wir Dinge wie HuffPo und Werbespionage bekommen.  Mittlerweile bin ich fast schon so weit, jedem, der gerne für Geld schreiben würde, zu empfehlen, auf keinen Fall Texte im Internet zu publizieren, und das schließt Forenkommentare mit ein.  Wenn das WWW unfähig ist, ökonomisch tragfähige Strukturen zur Verbreitung qualitativ hochwertiger Information zu unterhalten, dann ist es besser, dass es zu einer öden, trost- und geistlosen Informationswüste verkommt, weil auf diese Weise wenigstens einige zu papierbasierten Informationsprodukten zurückkehren werden.

Journalisten, die bereit sind, für Geldspenden betteln zu gehen oder gar ihre Einkommensverhältnisse zu offenbaren, nur um ein paar Texte veröffentlichen zu können, anstatt selbst den Preis zu bestimmen, sind mir generell suspekt, da ich bei ihnen immer den Verdacht habe, dass sie Journalismus lediglich als Vehikel für ihr ideologisch bedingtes Sendungsbewusstsein instrumentalisieren.

&gt; Istvan Sava, one of the leaders of the Hungarian Jobbik Radical Party, said that he could not cross the Ukrainian border, since it 5 years banned from entering Ukraine.
&gt; 
&gt; The leader of the Hungarian Jobbik party banned in Congress to Ukraine on Five years
&gt; 
&gt; A similar fate befell another representative Jobbik - Loranta Hehedyusha. This latter only found when trying to cross the border. However, no explanation on the matter was not a politician - writes party edition alfahir.hu.
&gt; 
&gt; Istvan Sava said that the decision Ukrainian government has no reason and justification. After all, it concerns the restriction of his personal life as his wife living in Transcarpathia is an ethnic Hungarian and citizen of Ukraine. So politician could not visit his family and congratulate his godchildren.
&gt; 
&gt; Jobbik leader applied to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Hungary that they intervened in the situation and strongly condemned the decision of the Ukrainian government.
&gt; 
&gt; Previously, several party members, including Sawa, was banned from entering Romania for a period of one year. But now, it is possible, and the United States.
&gt; 
&gt; Recall that it Istvan Sawai repeatedly emphasized that the purpose of the party Jobbik - is the creation Rusyn-Hungarian autonomy in Transcarpathia. Party representatives were present as official observers to the ""referendum"" in Crimea and ""elections"" in the self-proclaimed LPR and the DPR.
&gt; 
&gt; Back in June, Viktor Balogha [local Ukrainian politician] required to prohibit entry to Ukraine with the Hungarian Jobbik party members:
&gt; 
&gt; ""The last months of his statements European nationalists compete for the love of Putin and his money. And today in Moscow Hungarian Jobbik leader said that the war against terrorists in Ukraine is called ethnic cleansing of Russians. And those were not only the words of unhealthy politician, but the second most influential party in the Hungarian parliament. I believe that the answer to such actions by the new Ministry of Foreign Affairs must be instantaneous. And no matter whether it is our western neighbor, or east, such characters should be banned from entering the country.

Coal barely budged at all... not to mention dependency on Russian fossil fuel exports. You still effectively replaced nuclear with coal, just indirectly. Also keep in mind that these numbers are percentages, meaning that fossil fuels could still have increased in absolute terms, unless energy consumption overall went down in Germany. And you listed energy production, but not energy use, which leaves out import/export.

Our current power import-export looks like this: http://www.ffegmbh.de/images/stories/veroeffentlichungen/435_stromexporte_2013/karte_full.jpg

We import from Poland and the Czech Republic. All I could find for the Polish energy mix are articles about it keeping coal as main source and questionable articles about building two nuclear power plants.

As with the Euro and bankruptcies as you call it, the problem here lies with governments getting access to cheap money, which apparently one day ended, and now the governments were in debt and had to repay those loans, without access to additional cheap money.

We are discussing the Union of Utrecht. Part if the Low countries also formed a counter movement, with the Union of Aatrecht. Which involved most of the French speaking territories. A way more significant even would be the draft of the Act of Abjuration (Plakaat van Verlatinghe) in 1581 in Antwerp's. 

The Union of Utrecht and only ruled about military, religious issues, and that we would consider ourselves one state. The Act of Abjuration can be seen as out declaration of independence. Since we formally declared Philips II to no longer be our sovereign king, since he abused his rights on his subjects. The drafters where of Flemish and Brabantian cities. This formed the inspiration for Belgian declaration of independence in 1830.

Since we did want a sovereign King, we first attempted to interest Elisabeth of England. Second choice was William the Silent, but he got assassinated in 1584. After that the Staten-Generaal (the parliament) decided that they would assume sovereignty.

The Southern Provinces where lost later on during the war. In 1713 they where handed to the Austrian-Habsburg dynasty, because of the Treaty of Utrecht.  ",0,1419512977,null,0,false,0,cn4zg3s,t3_2q8l6e,t1_cn4zg3s,t1_cn45xo3,null,1425223494,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Permettimi di precisare che le mie parole sono state molto caute, e la mia visione delle cose è molto alla ""Americana"" (Laissez-faire) lasciare libera iniziativa il più possibile **ma** dando a tutti le stesse possibilità.

Il che non suona eccessivamente bene insieme a ""reddito di cittadinanza"" ma lasciami spiegare.

Comunque sia:

* mi sembra sicuramente un segno di civiltà dare a tutti le risorse minime per tirarsi fuori da situazioni di povertà

* in modo diretto o indiretto ? Se tutti hanno maggiori possibilità mi verrebbe da dire che ne tireremo fuori tutti dei vantaggi. In modo diretto starei parlando di dare una cifra sufficiente per sostenersi a chiunque non ci riesca con i propri mezzi. L'idea vera sarebbe quella di fare in modo che chi riceve tale sussidio non ne diventi dipendente, ma che tale sussidio dia la possibilità alla persona di svilupparsi e trovare una occupazione più remunerativa.

* ancora, l'idea non è di far campare tutti a spese dello stato, l'idea è che lo stato dia i mezzi necessari per fare in modo che chiunque riesca a svilupparsi, tra pagare l'assistenza sanitaria a vita ad un poveraccio che deve vivere per strada e pagare un anno di stipendio allo stesso poveraccio per darli la possibilità di aver un lavoro onorevole penso che le opzioni siano un no-brain dal punto di vista economico.

* purtroppo no.

Ora avrai capito che per reddito di cittadinanza non intendo regalare soldi, ma intendo dare a tutti i cittadini la possibilità di far crescere il paese e la loro propria persona.

Ovviamente, ci sono vari metodi per implementare tale strategia, magari possiamo garantire a chi fa richiesta una cifra di 100 che mese dopo mese scende fino a zero, così la persona sà di avere un tempo limitato per iniziare a creare redditto.

Tutte queste idee partono dal fatto che abbiamo notato che nei paesi non sviluppati i poveri sono tali non per pigrizia ma semplicemente per mancanza di risorse. Se lo stesso concetto è vero in un paese sviluppato non lo sappiamo ancora, ma secondo me vale la pena provare.

Der Autor meint mit der Demokratie sei etwas nicht in Ordnung, das gehe besser, man müsse nur einige Dinge tun um sie zurück zu erobern.

Syriza's plan can either succeed or fail.
In the case where it succeeds, then other EU countries that have similar problems to Greece's problems might take notice and try to do similar things.

Additionally, the Swedish police have improved the handling of rape cases, in an effort to decrease the number of unreported cases. For this reason, large-scale victimisation surveys have been presented by criminologists as a more reliable indicator of rape prevalence.

false,orthoxerox,RUSS,Russia,"I couldn't reduce the list to just ten events, so please welcome the thirteen events of Russian history, where the first three events are shared with Ukraine and the first one is shared with Belarus as well.

988 - The baptism of Rus. By linking ourselves to the heritage of the Eastern Roman Empire we have forever become almost, but not quite, European. 

1097 - The Council of Lyubech. Rus princes agree to split the lands of Kievan Rus into familial domains. New centers of power are thus formed, including Rostov/Suzdal/Vladimir in the northeastern lands. 

1240 - The Siege of Kiev. Burnt to the ground and no longer a source of prestige, Kiev loses its importance, and Rus princes concentrate on their own lands. Some are more successful than the others and thus Muscovy is born. 

1380 - The battle of Kulikovo field. Moscow prince Dmitriy defeats the non-Genghisid ruler of Golden Horde in a large battle, thereby allowing a Genghisid pretender to take the throne. In return, the Khan loses his power to appoint the ruler of Muscovy and can no longer check its growth. 

1552 - The siege of Kazan. Now it's Russia's turn to rule over the Tatars. With the inclusion of Kazan Khanate, the tsardom of Russia is no longer a nation state, but a multinational empire. 

October 22nd, 1612 - Poland's best year becomes the year of the beginning of the end. Polish expeditionary forces are forced out of Moscow, and King Sigismund's dream of uniting the two kingdoms is now only a dream. 183 years later, Poland itself becomes a dream. 

June 27th, 1709 - Battle of Poltava. Sweden is defeated, and Peter the Great's Russia proves it is no longer a quasi-European backwater, but a player in the top league. Russia's influence in Europe continues to grow.

1812 - Napoleon's invasion. Tired of Russia meddling in his attempts to make a neater Europe, Napoleon invades and loses his army to the weather and in tit-for-tat battles. Russian elite is disillusioned with France and Europe and enlightenment and tries to find the Russian way, starting the Golden Age of Russian arts. Meanwhile, Russia finds itself the policeman of Europe. 

1917 - drained by the Great War, Russian Empire unexpectedly has a revolution. The emperor is deposed, his brother refuses the crown. The newly formed republic manages to survive for several more hectic months. Bolsheviks topple the Provisional government and kick off the civil war. Four bloody years later they find themselves in charge of a vast and poor country and start remoulding it according to their ideals, starting and then stopping the Silver Age of Russian arts. 

May 9th, 1945 - the end of the bloodiest war in Russian history. The bloodiness can be attributed to both our treatment as untermenschen by the Nazis and to the mistakes of the Soviet government that led to having no other way to win the war. The fact that we didn't surrender despite the terrible price is the source of great pride for Russians. 

August, 1991 - a coup by government members trying to stop Gorbachov's reforms fails after people take to the streets, Gorbachov loses the last of his powers and Yeltsin orchestrates the dissolution of the USSR later that year. 

October, 1993 - a conflict between a socialist democratic parliament and a capitalist dictatorial president is resolved with tanks. Intellectual elite wants both democracy and capitalism and chooses the president. They've been wondering if that was a wise choice ever since. 

December 31st, 1999 - ""I am tired, I quit."" Yeltsin unexpectedly resigns and his youngish, active and popular PM becomes the acting president. Fifteen years later, he's still in charge.",0,1419519189,null,0,false,0,cn50r9p,t3_2q8l6e,t1_cn50r9p,t3_2q8l6e,null,1425222883,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Meine Freundin hat ihr auch ein Duschbad geschenkt, aber eins mit Mango und Papaya. Dazu gab es dann noch Lebkuchen und Geleebananen sowie ein Portemonnaie aus Echtleder.

Der kleine Bruder(14) meiner Freundin hat von uns Munchkin bekommen. Besser als ein Videospiel allemale, und er hat sich gefreut(und fragt schon seit gestern Abend wann wir das endlich mal spielen, haha).

Einer Freundin von mir habe ich ebenso Munchkin geschenkt, wir spielen desöfteren zusammen solche Spiele, da hat sich das gleich angeboten.

Und zu guter letzt habe ich ein Glas mit handgedrehten Joints verschenkt an jemanden, der leider selbst nicht so gut drehen kann, sich aber auch ohne meine Anwesenheit ab und zu mal gerne einen reinzwirbeln möchte. Handarbeit, Jungs!

false,[deleted],null,null,"Well, I have my opinions. But for the sake of the discussion I have to present the topic as objective as I can. 

Also in this particular case I'm personally troubled, because I didn't admire Navalny, but I respected his anti-corruption activities (not the political ones) and even gave money to the FBK (Navalny's Fund Against Corruption).

The question right now is the following - if they send him 5-10 years to jail the Opposition won't have an adequate leader, there would be power vacuum that might be filled with something much worse than the light populism that I can see in Navalny (see, some Khodorkovsky puppet).

During the sentence of Kirovles Navalny initially was sentenced to 5 years of real jail time. After 50 000 people went to the streets the prosecutor office inquired itself to suspend the jail-time.

So on one hand - I don't want Navalny to go to jail. On another hand - the evidence, at least in my eyes speaks that at least his brother is guilty. But if it wasn't for Navalny political activism the investigation would never be carried out (because 500k € in damages is not enough to spend all those men-hours to unveil offshore company and follow all those money transactions).

Other question is I would be 100% for the January 15th meeting if I had 100% guaranties that it wont turn into Euromaidan II. So I'm really troubled about that also.",0,1419519501,null,0,false,0,cn50u0a,t3_2qd3vm,t1_cn50u0a,t1_cn50lyi,null,1425222848,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Insulting the head of state in Romania is a national sport. Former president was consistently being called a thief, a dictator, a drunk, mocked at every opportunity. And this wasn't just on social media, it was happening at national TV as well. No one was ever prosecuted. He was even spat on for fuck sake. The current president is also being called a child trafficker by some people on Facebook, blogs etc. Again, nobody is pressing charges.

Thanks for an informative post.

&gt; Do you think that Navalny is innocent in the Kirovles case?

I don't know the evidence in the case, and cannot say whether he's guilty or not. But I find the charge *""Navalny using his official position (Governor's advisor) pressed Kirovles director to sign non-profitable contract""* difficult to prove without very compelling evidence. For example, Kirovles director saying so is not enough.

&gt; Do you think that Navalny is innocent in the GlavPodpiska case?

I don't know the evidence in this case either, and cannot say whether he's guilty or not.

But if the charge actually is *""Oleg Navalny forced Yves Rocher to sign that contract and this way committed damages for around 500-600 thousands euros""* I don't think Navalny is guilty. The deal was crappy and Yves Rocher probably regrets that. But I don't think Navalny has the ability to force Yves Rocher to do anything. And the charge of Navalny pressing Yves Rocher with a web petition is silly.

And it looks like the money was legal to begin with so the charge of money laundering does not hold water. Seems more likely he was subsidizing his parents through the rent contract.

To me it's the missing €100,000 that sounds serious. A company should be able to keep its accounts correctly and show where that sum has been spent.

&gt; In case an opposition leader is guilty - should he be exonerated to preserve the democracy process?

Generally I'd say resounding *no* because an opposition leader should be able to observe higher standards than the corruption he is opposing. Then again, I don't know how many clean opposition leaders you have queued up. And we should not forget that the legal cases may be politically motivated.

&gt; As a Russian who thinks that Navalny is clearly guilty in the second criminal case against him - should I go January 15th on the street and join the opposition to preserve the political diversity and almost unique independent opposition leader?

&gt; Erdogan worked with the PKK, resulting in greater kurdish support for him, as well as overall less terrorist attacks by PKK during his rule

Now, yes, *that* is a good thing. Most importantly, the Kurds are mostly left in peace, the language ceased to be outlawed in schools and media etc, in general, the oppression, if not ended completely, did take a fucking break.

In first case - we have testimony. But the testimony could be beaten from that ex-director, taking in account that he himself faced criminal charges - it is a very strong possibility.

Since I agree with the legal principle - in doubt always on side of the accused (*reasonable doubt* in Common law, *in dubio pro reo* in the European law system). Then I must say, that in my opinion, Navalny shouldn't have been convicted in the first criminal case.

While in the second criminal case: we have Bruno Lepru - regional director of foreign company (cannot be easily pressed by the Investigation Committee) who denounced the contract to the criminal police/investigation committee.

So even if we admit that Lepru for some reason was pressed to do so - we still have a lot of circumstantial evidence that can be appreciated independently: offshore-controlled company with 0 real activity and almost 0 personnel that gained over 150 000 euros in a year for several years in a row (seems shady to me); fictitious contract with Navalny parents firm for unreal renting price (seems like washing money to me); prices for services 40-50% over market ones (seems like kick-backs to me); Oleg Navalny being high rank in Russian Post...

* Lione - Torino poco frequentata, sembra spreco risorse e l'investimento non sembra ripagare il basso numero di merci trasportate su rotaia.
* L'opera prevede la costruzione di una nuova ferrovia, quando ne esiste già una. Una delle proposte iniziali dei No Tav era appunto quella di potenziare la linea esistente.
* La valle è piccola e ha già molte infrastrutture: una linea ferroviaria in disuso, una vecchia utilizzata e un'autostrada.
* La montagna in cui si scava il tunnel potrebbe avere amianto
* Un importante centro di smistamento merci era stato previsto nel progetto iniziale a Novara, così da rendere manifestamente inutile la TAV, dato che poi ci sarebbe stato il trasporto su gomma fino a Novara. Il progetto poi è stato rivisto e il centro è stato spostato a Orbassano (ai piedi della val Susa), anche grazie alle pressioni dei No Tav, rendendo il progetto più logico.

Certamente è un NIMBY, però, visto dalla lente dei No Tav, in questo contesto il progetto sembra davvero poco sensato, per i costi, possibili danni ed eventuali benefici. Il grosso problema degli oppositori alla Tav è che hanno calcolato costi e benefici unicamente sul corto/medio periodo (durata del tempo di costruzione) e su scala locale (val di Susa). A mio modo di vedere, invece, il progetto dovrebbe essere visto alla luce di un graduale potenziamento generalizzato della rotaia su scala nazionale, o meglio, continentale, sia per trasporto merci che passeggeri, a discapito della gomma e degli aerei sugli spazi brevi. Potenziamento che rientra in un modo o nell'altro in tutti i piani strategici di urbanistica e di infrastrutture dei trasporti d'Europa.

Il grosso problema del movimento di per sé è che non ha saputo chiamarsi fuori dalle strumentalizzazioni, diventando punto cardine del m5s e ha accettato qualunque cane al suo interno, compresa una vasta gamma di antagonisti che lo usano come scusa per fare le peggio cose. Per questo motivo hanno perso tutta la legittimità che si erano riusciti a costruire, almeno, per quanto mi riguarda, a livello regionale.

Detto questo, credo che alla fine vinceranno, perché sinora sono riusciti a ritardare moltissimo i lavori e superata una certa scadenza temporale l'UE ritira indietro li schei e la Francia non sembra per niente intenzionata a mettere più del previsto.

false,CreepyOctopus,LATV,Latvia | Sweden,"To the best of my ability of being impartial. I am fairly familiar with the criminal charges against Navalny, and with his political/anti-corruption work.

Speaking from a general democracy and justice perspective, I believe everyone should have due process and a fair trial. Except in extreme cases, I tend not to pass any judgment regarding whether someone is guilty, and leave it to the courts. This is why I am somewhat baffled by the huge ""do you think X is guilty"" discussions that sometimes come up in prominent American criminal cases, such as when some vigilante shot a black teen a year ago (don't remember the names of the people involved). Normally, that's for the courts to decide, and even in cases when somebody has been killed there are many things to consider.

I certainly wouldn't pass a judgment regarding either of Navalny's cases. They are economical in nature, which makes that even harder. In the Kirovles case, Navalny is being accused of misusing his official position, but the case largely relies on the testimony of one person, and has an economic component (was the deal intentionally non-profitable?). In the Yves Rocher case, it is even more complex, the accusations involve a scheme involving shady deals and money laundering, and it seems that the legality of the deals signed would depend on details of Russian law, and it's not something easily understandable to an outsider. I am not really competent to judge the testimony or character of the Kirovles director, and I am even less competent to understand the details of the Yves Rocher deal, and their legality. As such, I would not feel comfortable saying with any degree of certainty whether Navalny is guilty or not.

Also from an overall justice perspective, I don't think being an opposition politician should make any difference. People shouldn't be given lesser sentences, or be immune from prosecution, because they're opposition politicians.

Now, however, all of this is heavily influenced by the fact that it's Russia. I have absolutely zero trust in the independence of the Russian judiciary. Especially when opposition politicians are on trial, it takes a very strongly democratic society, and a strong judiciary, for the trial to believably be merely a criminal trial, and not a means of silencing the opposition. Russia does not fullfil those conditions. It's not a democratic country, the judiciary cannot really be seen as strong and independent, and the Russian leadership neither wants nor tolerates real opposition. Given this, I feel it's extremely likely that the court ruling in Navalny's cases is being decided in the Kremlin and not in the courtroom. My usual skepticism is again fueled by the timing of the cases, such as the Kirovles case beginning right after RosPil became very popular, as did the ""partiya zhulikov i vorov"", or him receiving a gag order in the Yves Rocher case at a time that was very convenient to the government.",0,1419523841,null,0,false,0,cn523h6,t3_2qd3vm,t1_cn523h6,t3_2qd3vm,null,1425222259,19,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,19

To transform AC you need fairly simple and easy to maintain transformers, while DC needs stacks of switching electronics which are also more prone to failure.

So HVDC may be the only way to absorb all that low-quality power over the long term (until maybe large scale breeder nuclear power or fusion power). Either way, the lower density and variability of renewables requires more powerlines to be built even if consumption stays the same.

false,my_baby_ate_dingos,IDF,Ile-de-France,"Ca dépend du contexte. Dans des environnements ""sociaux"" (bar, boîte...) c'est très difficile. Y'a très peu de mecs qui peuvent aller directement vers une nana et dire en substance ""Salut, je te paie un verre?"" J'ai jamais réussi. Trop peur de la réponse. 

Si t'es dans un bar, mon approche préférée consiste à aller au comptoir pour se servir et s'arranger pour être à côté d'une fille qui t'intéresse. Idéalement si elle est seule ou avec une copine, parce qu'une fille en groupe de 3 et plus aura immédiatement un ""groupe défensif"" (je sais pas comment le dire autrement) qui ne voudra pas la laisser partir. Si elle est seule, je teste le terrain avec un coup d'oeil (si elle te regarde, c'est déjà très bien parti) et un commentaire quelconque, pouvant aller du ""Bonjour"" à ""Oh, tu prends une Corona? C'est une bonne idée ça, ça fait longtemps que j'en ai pas pris"". Si y'a un signe d'intérêt (si elle te répond par monosyllabes et se détourne de toi, pas besoin d'avoir fait bac +5 crypto pour se dire que non, elle est pas intéressée) tu peux continuer la conversation. Si elle est avec une copine, attends d'avoir une ouverture pour réagir sur leur conversation. Mais une vraie, quelque chose qui te fais vraiment réagir, parce que le gros lourd qui s'immisce dans une discussion à tout prix, il est transparent.

De toute façon, dans un bar, tu peux pas aborder une fille sans une ouverture de sa part, aussi minime soit-elle. Le mec capable d'attirer l'intérêt d'une femme qu'elle soit venue ici pour rencontrer des mecs ou non, il existe, mais c'est pas moi.

Dans une boîte, il faut aimer les boîtes. C'est pas le cas de tout le monde (de moins en moins, d'ailleurs) mais faut se lâcher complètement. Pas penser aux filles, tu danses juste et tu t'amuses. Pourquoi je dis ça? Parce qu'une boite c'est la mort de la communication interpersonnelle. A tel point que les mecs que je vois draguer en dansant sont toujours les gros lourds qui pensent que des mouvements de bassins suggestifs en direction d'une nana vont la faire fondre. Toute autre tentative de discussion plus subtile est bouée à l'échec

Le seul truc a faire c'est de danser, boire (personnellement, je ne peux pas faire le premier sans avoir commencé par le second) et quand une femme qui a l'air mignonne (parce qu'à la lumière de la boîte, en plus, tu vois pas grand-chose et tu peux vite déchanter... Elle aussi, d'ailleurs.) entre dans ta zone générale d'existence, approche-toi sans la coller. Si elle s'écarte pas, si elle te regarde et/ou reconnait ta présence physique d'une certaine manière, essaie de lui proposer de prendre un verre (il faut recourir aux gestes pour ça, derrière le toum-toum-toum) et emmène-là dans un coin ou tu peux parler. Sinon, ne dis rien et attends la fin de la soirée pour rentrer avec... Mais ça, je connais peu de mecs capables de le faire.

Après, la meilleure solution reste l'amie d'un ami, que tu vois en soirée d'anniversaire/nouvel an/whatever et avec qui tu peux engager la conversation. Je m'amusais beaucoup, à une époque, à lancer des soirées avec plusieurs potes de différents groupes pour ouvrir des portes a mes ami(e)s célibataires.

Une fois que tu as engagé la conversation, il faut réussir à prendre son numéro tout en évitant la phase de rejet. Celle qui se matérialise, dans mon expérience, par un ""Eh mais t'es moche en fait"" avant de tourner les talons, ou un verre de coca (un *large*, en plus) en travers de la figure. Celle-là, j'ai pas réussi à la dépasser. Faudrait demander à quelqu'un d'autre.

Latvia - quite safe from violent crime, except certain areas that are much less safe. Just like our Estonian and Lithuanian neighbours, we have the highest murder rates in the EU, but the majority of those are so-called ""domestic murders"", which is code for one of two things - a few people (usually 2 or 3) getting extremely drunk together and then somebody kills somebody, or a chronic alcoholic with a history of domestic abuse finally killing his wife. This is limited to a certain demographic, and wouldn't affect the rest of the citizens.

There are a few locations where being robbed or assaulted by [charming people](http://www.kasjauns.lv/lv/bildes/Latvija/08.06.2010/maskacka.jpg) is quite likely if you're walking alone after dark, but the good thing is those areas are localized and well-known. Other than that, the main threats would be from small-time thieves trying to cut open your purse on a bus or pickpocket you in crowded areas. Car theft really has gone down.

Sweden is very safe, with a few shadier areas that still feel safer than the shady areas in Latvia or, for that matter, countries like Belgium.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_declension#Numerals

&gt; The numbers from 1 to 9 are declinable. The number 1 (viens/viena) combines with a singular noun, 2 (divi/divas) through 9 (deviņi/deviņas) with plural nouns.

So I guess 'cents' will take nominative singular form with 1 - `cents`, and nominative plural with 5, 2 - `centi`

However

&gt; The following cardinal numbers are indeclinable:
&gt; 
&gt;* the numerals 11–19: vienpadsmit, divpadsmit, trīspadsmit, četrpadsmit, piecpadsmit, sešpadsmit, septiņpadsmit, astoņpadsmit, deviņpadsmit
&gt;* desmit (10) and its compounds: divdesmit, trīsdesmit, četrdesmit, piecdesmit, sešdesmit, septiņdesmit, astoņdesmit, deviņdesmit

Sure, but in a functioning democracy, by definition such cases will be rare. Sometimes the courts get it wrong. Not only because of political reasons, but also because of more mundane reasons such as pressure to officially resolve the case, etc. Especially in such cases, some level of involvement from the society is great. For instance, I really respect the [Innocence Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innocence_Project). They have (and some others have) shown that USA convicts a significant number of innocent people, and they do a great job at helping such people be exonerated, but the people in Innocence Project are experts in law and related areas. I likewise respect Amnesty International reports, but those are again made by experts who know the law, who are very well familiar with the countries they write about, have their own researchers, and so on.

I, on the other hand, have no similar expertise. Even if it seems to me that someone is being prosecuted for political reasons (Khodorkovsky, Navalny to take Russian examples), I'll try to seek out opinions from experts.

&gt; What would be your opinion about the meeting on January 15th?

I find it highly encouraging that people are protesting a political trial. I guess most of those who will attend the protest feel, like I do, that the court ruling is going to be political, and that is something that should be protested.

I guess my main difference opinion with you would be that you said in another comment you don't want this to be a Euromaidan II.

German plants are more modern, and operate under a different principle. (PWR rather than BWR). Comparing them is hard, but chances of a fatal error are slim.

&gt;Well, no, not really. Germany is a net electricity exporter, not importer, and we're also a transit country.
Have a look at France: They're importing nearly 10TWh from us. And they're nearly 100% nuclear.

France is also a net electricity exporter and actually 75% nuclear, 20% hydro.

&gt;Last, but not least: Building nuclear plants takes time. A lot of time, and it's expensive, so expensive that in the UK, the government has to promise insane feed-in tariffs for that new plant.

Hinkley does not have feed-in tarrifs. It has a strike price. This is different, because it means that if the grid price goes over the strike price, it means that the difference is returned to the governement.

According, again, to the relevant UK grid institutions, prices are expected to reach those levels regularly by the time the plant comes online.

There's also a gain-share mechanism, which stipulates that the UK taxpayer will recieve 60% of the plant's profit, if Return of investement exceeds 13.5%.


&gt;And that's not even counting subsidising the insurance policy... without the state lowering the requirements / taking that risk itself, it's questionable if an operator could even find an insurer because if shit hits the fan, it's going to nuke balance sheets from orbit.

That policy is slowly being abandoned in favour of Industry wide insurance projects. Currently, IIRC, plants are responsible for accident damage in the billion USD range, and funds exists to pay for that much. Spread out after all, the accident cost is trivial.

&gt;We're better off -- yes, economically speaking -- expanding renewables than investing in nuclear. With the exception of fusion, that is, but fusion will be ready for production in 20 years earliest.

Aside from generally being expensive. (German Fit is rather high), there's an increasing grid cost. Germany doesn't suffer much from this as it's well connected in Europe, but in Japan these problems are increasing rapidly.

As solar and wind share increases, the grid is going to run in trouble.

Es bildeten sich Fraktionen, auf der einen Seite vor allem Türken und Tschetschenen, auf der anderen Seite eher Afrikaner. Gewalttaten standen an der Tagesordnung. Es wurde versucht, den Bewohnern Messer und andere Waffen zu entziehen, aufgrund von diversen Nachschubquellen waren solche Bemühungen nur mäßig erfolgreich. 

Bei den Bewohnern handelte es sich großteils um männliche Personen, von 80 Personen, die es in dieser Einrichtung gab waren insgesamt 8 zwei Familien zugehörig. Bezüglich der Herkunft der Bewohner gab es einige Verwirrungen, es wurden als Herkunftsort relativ oft der Irak oder Afghanistan benannt, eigenartigerweise beherrschten relativ viele der angeblichen Afghanen oder Iraker keine der Landessprachen. Eine weitere spezielle Sache, die relativ viel an mir hängen bleibenden Schreibaufwand erforderte waren falsche Altersangaben. Einige der ""minderjährigen Asylsuchenden"" zeigten beginnenden Haarausfall.

Ich hatte nicht den Eindruck, dass die Bewohner an Integration interessiert waren. Es zeigte sich eine Erwartungshaltung, dass in Bälde der Reichtum ausbrechen würde. Essen, Unterkunft und alles mögliche wurden von den Bewohnern immer als zu schlecht kritisiert. Einer der wenige deutschen Sätze, den sich manche Herrschaften zu lernen bequemten und den man relativ oft zu hören bekam war ""Ey Schwabbo, Ich hab dich gfickt"".

The problem was that Germans didn't integrate Turks into their society, and thought that they're better off if they are left by themselves, among themselves. 




It turned wrong, now Turks are blamed for being not well integrated, however, there's a strong shift coming. You have to understand that German society is making it much harder for Turks by pointing their fingers on Turks for either being well integrated, or not well integrated. For example Mesut Özil, or a rapper rapping about dealing drugs, beating cops winning the prize for being a role model for integration is quite ridiculous. BTW Mesut can neither speak properly German, nor properly Turkish. And there are thousands of Turkish academics in Germany who would have rather earned it. 



Integration is a process which just occurs, but is ought to be supported by the government. 




Almancıs are mostly left alone, so they have been a society which has elements of being Turkish, and elements of Germany. 



In my honest opinion it is wrong to compare them to Turks from Turkey or any other society, they've become themselves a different society. ",0,1419528459,null,0,false,0,cn53pxv,t3_2qcsrx,t1_cn53pxv,t1_cn51ajy,null,1425221501,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Une nana disponible et un minimum intéressée va donner des signaux. Le plus évident c'est le regard. Le problème c'est que la réaction de base des mecs un peu timides (comme moi) quand ils croisent le regard d'une nana, c'est de baisser les yeux - grosse erreur. Maintenir le regard, faire un grand sourire - si elle sourit aussi, c'est une invitation à approcher. Si elle détourne le regard illico, je laisse tomber.

Une fois qu'on sait repérer ce genre de choses, peu importe ce qu'on dit, faut juste s'approcher et entamer une discussion. Ce qui compte encore une fois c'est l'attitude, faut approcher avec un langage du corps confiant (se tenir droit, prendre un peu de place, sourire). Perso j'aime bien démarrer avec une remarque un peu sarcastique sur la soirée, parce que j'aime bien les nanas qui ont de la répartie, mais tout dépends.

Evidemment, ça vaut surtout pour les situations dans lesquelles ce genre de choses est encouragé (soirée, bar, etc). Dans la rue ou les transports j'essaie même pas, aucune envie de passer pour un relou. Les transports en commun sont un excellent endroit pour pratiquer le contact de regard quand on a un peu d'anxiété sociale, en revanche - faut que le combo regards qui se croisent -&gt; sourire devienne automatique.

En boîte/soirée électro, perso je n'aborde pas, sauf au fumoir à la rigueur. Je déteste crier pour me faire comprendre, et quand je suis dans le son c'est pour danser.

The Japanese grid is also a complete mess, no wonder it has trouble adapting. 

&gt; As solar and wind share increases, the grid is going to run in trouble.

If the detractors from back in the days were to be believed, we'd be dealing with rolling blackouts on a daily basis by now. Both are actually rather well predictable, they're not oscillating wildly, either. Considering it wasn't built for what it's used for right now, the German one is actually holding up very well. But, yes, stuff needs to be done, and *will* be done, Germans aren't suddenly going to get used to blackouts. Those generally just don't happen here.

Right now we need more transmission capacity, especially north-south to bridge the wind/solar divide, connections to Norway's pump storage are  well-underway...:

But we're probably going to need more storage than that, especially long-term. Synthetic gas comes to mind, we have absurd storage capacities for that and if you generate it with surplus energy, round-trip efficiency isn't that crucial. Commercial-scale prototypes are already operational. *Maybe* we'll even synthesise liquid fuel, as I'm sceptical when it comes to batteries small enough for cars but performant enough for the Autobahn. Those Tesla cars work in the US because of their insanely low speed limits: If you drive them at Autobahn speeds, what you gain in time you have to spend waiting for the battery to load mid-trip, on as short distances as Hamburg-Berlin. A Golf GTE is much, much more Autobahn-capable.

Next thing up is frequency regulation. Now, gas isn't going to vanish, but their turbines might not be enough to do it. In Schwerin there's 5MWh worth of lithium batteries for that in operation since September, seems to be working well.

tl;dr: The technology is there. Price point? Hard to tell. But unlike nuclear, all this stuff is more recent tech and is going to become cheaper only if we actually build it.

Navalny is clearly anti-immigration from Central Asia. He also coined the phrase: ""[Let's stop feeding the Caucasus](http://navalny.livejournal.com/627082.html)"", meaning that the government should reduce the money-flow to that depressed region. 

But later that phrase, that slogan was adopted by more radical groups, like neo-nazis and such. So I cannot say if he was in any way involved in the street violence.

He indeed participated in the infamous '[Russian Marches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNC9dU1EeC4)' and other nationalist [meetings](http://youtu.be/oLqYpsRnatQ?t=9m20s). But blaming him for foreigner deaths? I don't know, seems too hardcore to me.

Besides if such a tax was enforced most rich people would just move their money to other countries and leave Belgium altogether. The taxes haven't gone up for the middle and lower classes, in fact they have decreased slightly. 

I'm guessing you think we should enforce a wealth tax. A lot of countries like Swedne and Austria have already abandoned this kind of tax because it just didn't work in practice. A study from the Institute d'enterprise concluded that although a wealth tax may sound good, it just doesn't work in practice. I think we should learn from our neighbors and not implement it, because it's sure to fail in practice.

Not only that but wealth tax also destroys one of the core principles our society is founded on. Implementing a wealth tax is basically a ways for the government to take away our right of owning our own money and our access to the free market.

It's not defeatism, it's being realistic. It's stupid to inforce laws if you know that it won't have any effects or even have negative effects.

false,Dhaecktia,piemonte,,"Premessa: quelli che ho scritto sono i principali punti che mi sembra che i No Tav abbiano esposto (escluso il solito delle infiltrazioni mafiosi, spreco denaro pubblico, etc...). Non sono assolutamente qui per difenderli, ho semplicemente espresso il loro punto di vista.

Questo è quello che penso io:
&gt;Ma non sarà poco frequentata perchè inefficiente?

E' poco frequentata perché c'è poca gente che fa quella tratta. Da lì ci passa il Milano - Parigi (che fa anche Torino e Lione), ma non è certo un treno che si riempe e soprattutto è veloce solo da Lione in poi, dato che si ferma in tutte le stazioni in Val di Susa.

Per le merci semplicemente c'è poca roba trasportata col treno. Di già il trasporto merci tra Torino e Lione non è particolarmente intenso, per di più, per quel che c'è si preferisce la gomma.

La sfida della TAV sarebbe proprio quella di promuovere il trasporto su rotaia e aumentare i passeggeri, cosa che i No Tav dubitano fortemente.

&gt; Però ragazzi la tav non è semplicemente ""una ferrovia"", è un tipo particolare di ferrovia che apre diversi scenari.

Infatti. La vecchia ferrovia non è in grado di essere modernizzata per un treno ad alta velocità. Se lo si vuole fare, quindi, bisogna costruire una nuova ferrovia.

&gt; cosa vuol dire ""tante"" infrastrutture? Quando diventano tante? Secondo quali parametri? Cosa c'entra l'autostrada?

Questa è la critica legata all'incidenza che la TAV avrebbe sul paesaggio. Le infrastrutture sono tante nel senso che c'è già un'autostrada e un'altra linea ferroviaria, che indubbiamente incidono molto dal punto di vista paesaggistico/ambientale. Il ""peso"" di queste infrastrutture è piuttosto notevole, soprattutto se si comparano con le valli vicine, come la val Chisone e la val Pellice, che sono relativamente spoglie.

&gt; questa valutazione secondo la quale la presenza del trasporto su gomma rende inutile la rotaia chi l'ha fatta?

L'idea alla base della costruzione della TAV è proprio quella di sostituire nel tempo il trasporto su gomma con quello su rotaia, più efficiente e soprattutto meno dannoso per l'ambiente.


Per approfondire consiglio il libro ""La TAV e la Valle di Susa"" di Dansero e Bobbio, che sono un geografo ed un esperto di politica e analizzano la questione secondo la materia in cui sono esperti.

E il fatto che ti abbiamo detto tutti di utilizzarlo in altra maniera a te fa proprio schifo, neh?

&gt;La Repubblica Serenissima di Venezia e' stato un fulgido esempio a meta' tra oligarchia e plutocrazia, i tempi saran cambiati, ma nulla dice che la democrazia sia la forma di governo definitiva del futuro. E' solo una soluzione di compromesso.

Oh, ho capito che alle medie andavi forte, ma dire che la democrazia è ""una soluzione di compromesso"" e la Serenissima un ""fulgido esempio"" denota una certa scarsezza di conoscenza della storia. Secondo te Fabio Fabrin, fabbro, viveva come Fabio Fabrin, piccolo imprenditore della catena, oggi?

My dad learned German for his Masters degree but he never spoke a word of it at home with us. Long story short, he died when I was a teenager and it wasn't until recently (15+ years later) that I realized what a pure genius he was. He studied chemistry and physics, earned a degree and later lectured on philosophy, and had a life-long love of all sciences (astronomy, abstract mathematics, biology, psychology and neuroscience, etc.) which he indulged in his down-time because he worked as a computer programmer. I was just too young to really appreciate him and all he had to offer. And now I'm getting bit by the same curiosity bug and starting to explore my own (amateur) interests in various subjects.

The pronunciation is fun, the grammar is making perfect sense to me, and I feel something of a connection to my father.

My plan is to continue with DuoLingo German, using Google and the various language-related subreddits to supplement, until I get to a point where I can read simple news or online articles and then use that to increase my vocabulary and learn natural grammar patterns that native speakers use/understand.

I asked my mother. She's one of those people that swallow a book per day. She recommends ""Der Besuch der alten Dame"" by Dürrenmatt. Those books are not that thick and since you've read ""Der Richter und sein Henker"", it would probably fit your course.

""Die unendliche Geschichte"" seems to be quite nice a well. Certainly a classic. Americans usually only know the film but the book is way better.

If you want something more modern, check out Tintenherz, Tintenblut, Tintentod by Kornelia Funke. It's a book for young adults but Kornelia Funke is the closest thing we've got to our version of J.K. Rowling. And I'd say J.K. is certainly modern *real* English literature.

Another one, a real masterpiece, ""Schlafes Bruder"" by Robert Schneider - a must read, and even the movie is a great, while slightly unsettling watch. Also gives a great impression of 19th century life in remote Austrian villages, dark, depressing, inspiring.

Thinking about this, one more from Austria - very poetic, philosophic with a touch of Robinson Crusoe - ""Die Wand"" by Marlen Haushofer. Again with the bonus of a movie for the shortcut to understanding the whole thing. Due to the nature of the story the movie is pretty, but doesn't do the book any justice.

For me, a decent a party would be a pro-EU, liberal one, since Hungary is in no way independent from the EU, nor we can sustain ourselves in case we get kicked out. Not to mention the EU money spent on school-renovations, medical equipment, etc. Plus, pro-EU parties don't tend to be xenophobic, which would be fucking great for a change.


The ""liberal"" opposition is in ruins. Former PM Ferenc Gyurcsány is a public enemy in Hungary, and he's still one of the main figures of the opposition. This is one of the reasons Fidesz and Jobbik can get so many votes. They share the hatred against Gyurcsány, and some of them don't vote *for* a party or *for* a politician, they vote *against* another one. This mentality is the downfall of democracy imo. We don't even try to seek alternatives, because we fear that if we would, Gyurcsány would ""come back"". Pro-government media confirms this.


National debt? Higher taxes? Emigration? Increased poverty? Racism? Social-benefits for those who don't deserve it? Same response: ""Hurr durr liberals hurr durr Gyurcsány hurr durr 2006 hurr durr revolutionaries hurr durr liberals came from hell""

Fun fact: Gyurcsány wasn't even liberal. MSZP = Socialist. Whatever, Fidesz managed to bury the word ""liberalism"" in just 4 years. They declared illiberal democracy in Hungary.


Currently there is one party that is liberal and pro-EU, but they get like, 5% of the votes every 4 years. I have no idea if they're competent or not, since they haven't done shit since they got into the Parlament.


So yeah. It seems like Hungary wants xenophobic, discriminating, racist guys to pull the strings, while they eat szotyola and drink Kőbányai beer in front of the TV. With every protest, I regain some hope that maybe I'm not part of a minority, and people actually want to change our country. Then I listen to the speeches and I feel betrayed. Now I just hope I can get out of this shithole before we get our asses kicked out from the EU.

false,Krawall2,null,null,"&gt;#01 Ahnungslose wissen: »Wir können doch nicht die ganze Welt aufnehmen«

&gt;Richtig ist: Davon sind wir Lichtjahre entfernt. 

Diese Übertreibung ist ein Stilmittel der Rhetorik. Ähnlich wie ""Das Boot ist voll"" bezieht es sich nicht auf den in im Boot Deutschland zur Verfügung stehenden Raum, sondern die Kapazitäten welche das Land bereit ist frei zu machen und was die Bevölkerung als erträglich empfindet. Dies hat nicht zwangsweise etwas damit zu tun, dass hier nicht genügend Raum/Geld existiert.

&gt;#02 Besorgte Bürger finden: »Die vielen Flüchtlinge sind ein großes Problem«

&gt;Richtig ist: Ein Problem haben vor allem die Flüchtlinge. 

Es ist keine legitime Argumentation zu behaupten jemand hat größere Probleme und deshalb sind die eigenen hinten anzustellen. Dies trifft spätestens dann zu, wenn man dies auf die Flüchtlinge selber anwendet, denn dann kann man auch behaupten die Probleme der Wirtschaftsflüchtlinge sind nicht so gravierend wie der die vor Krieg fliehen und dementsprechend sind deren Anträge gar nicht erst zu bearbeiten bzw. die Kapazitäten denen nicht zur Verfügung zu stellen.

&gt;#03 Panikmacher wissen: »Die kommen alle nach Deutschland«

&gt;Richtig ist: In der EU liegt Deutschland mit seinen Asylzahlen im Mittelfeld. 

Auch das ist Rosinenpickerei, dies räumt man auch ein. Deutschland nimmt zahlenmäßig die meisten Flüchtlinge auf. So könnte man auch Staaten wie der Türkei vorwerfen nicht genügend für die Flüchtlinge zu tun. Besonders zynisch wird das, wenn man bedenkt das die Sozialleistungen für Deutsche immer weiter zusammengestrichen werden, für diese also immer weniger da ist. Dennoch nimmt man gleichzeitig die meisten Flüchtlinge auf. Da in Deutschland immer noch ein Bild von Gleichheit vorherrscht, also jeder meint alle haben in etwa gleich viel, wird auch angenommen der Flüchtling nehme einem etwas weg. Dies ist aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach nicht der Fall, wird aber dennoch so empfunden.

&gt;#04 Einfältige sind überzeugt: »Die meisten sind nur Wirtschaftsflüchtlinge«

&gt;Richtig ist: Die Gründe, die Menschen in die Flucht treiben, wiegen schwer. 

Auch hier wird das Argument verzerrt. Richtig ist: 98% der Asylanträge werden abgelehnt und dies obwohl die Asylgründe sehr weit gefasst sind. Ein anderer Grund ist auch, dass vornehmlich junge Männer sich auf die Reise machen um hier in Deutschland von der wirtschaftlichen Lage zu profitieren und nicht etwa Frauen und Kinder, die wahrscheinlich wesentlich größere Not leiden. Denen die dies erkennen Einfältigkeit vorzuwerfen hilft dem Argument zu einer liberaleren Flüchtlingspolitik nicht.

&gt;#05 Politiker predigen: »Roma haben es nur auf unsere Sozialleistungen abgesehen«

&gt;Richtig ist: Populisten machen Stimmung gegen Roma. 

Erneut eine Verzerrung. Es ist mittlerweile sogar so, dass die Roma in den Herkunfsländern angehalten werden auszuwandern. Staaten wie Deutschland, die selbst Kindergeld für nicht hier lebende Kinder zahlen und die Scheinselbstständigkeit und anderes Möglichkeiten der Erschleichung von Leistungen nur unzureichend prüfen sind daher auch die Länder in welche die meisten Roma ziehen.

Natürlich wird auch hier überspitzt ausgedrückt alle hätten es nur auf die Sozialleistungen abgesehen, was natürlich nicht richtig ist. Viele arbeitsfähige Roma enden hier in den Händen von Ausbeutern und arbeiten zu Hungerlöhnen, während der deutsche Staat die Versorgung der Familie übernehmen muss. Dieser Missbrauch wird aufgrund des starken Einflusses der Asyllobby auch nicht bekämpft. Anstatt also die Arbeitsbedingungen stärker zu kontrollieren und Arbeit zu solchen Hungerlöhnen gar nicht erst zuzulassen, wird der Steuerzahler hier einfach belastet. 

Dieses Problem ist im Übrigen nicht exklusiv für Roma sondern auch für andere, deutsche Arbeitnehmer. Der Staat gestattet die Beschäftigung zu derart miserablen Konditionen, dass er die Löhne aus Steuergeldern und Beiträgen aufstockt. Da der Lohn nicht zum Familienunterhalt reicht, übernimmt der Staat auch gleich den Unterhalt der Familie. Die Armut ist staatlich zum Profit der Wirtschaft gewollt. Die Herkunft ist diesem dabei egal.

&gt;#06 Egoisten sagen: »Wir können doch nicht alle Probleme dieser Welt lösen.«

&gt;Richtig ist: Wir sind mitverantwortlich für die Bedingungen, die Menschen in die Flucht treiben. 

Hier muss man scharf differenzieren. Dieses ""Wir"" schließt einen Großteil der Bevölkerung nicht mit ein. Ginge es nach dieser würden wir keine Waffen nach Katar oder Saudi Arabien liefern, die in Syrien Menschen töten. Wir würden weder in Afghanistan Truppen stehen haben, noch hätten wir uns in der UN bei der Resolution gegen Libyen enthalten, sondern klar dagegen gestimmt. Ein Großteil der Deutschen unterstützt die Kriegs- und Destabilisierungspolitik der Bundesregierung nicht sondern lehnt sie vehement ab. 

Deshalb ist dieses ""Wir"" so heuchlerisch. Das Volk soll aufnehmen und helfen wo es kann, die Regierung sorgt im Sinne der Wirtschaft und Asyllobby dafür, dass weiterhin Flüchtlinge produziert werden.

#07 Ignorante Europäer denken: »Es kann doch nicht ganz Afrika kommen«

&gt;Richtig ist: Afrika ist ein riesiger, vielseitiger Kontinent. Längst nicht alle AfrikanerInnen wollen nach Europa. 

Siehe #1

&gt;#08 Engherzige sagen: »Hier ist kein Platz mehr für Flüchtlinge«

&gt;Richtig ist: Mit vernünftiger Planung könnten wir viel mehr Menschen aufnehmen.

Man könnte. Aber soll es das Ziel sein, die Bedingungen in den Herkunftsländern weiterhin derart zu verschlechtern, dass eine Flucht nötig wird? Sollten sich die Anstrengung der Planung nicht in diese Richtung bewegen und Geld dafür in die Hand genommen werden? Dieses Argument wird nämlich auch ziehen, wenn Deutschland alle Flüchtlinge der Welt aufgenommen hat. Effizienter kann man immer werden.

&gt;#09 Hetzer behaupten: »Asylbewerber sind gefährlich, kriminell und unordentlich«

&gt;Richtig ist: Flüchtlinge sind so verschieden wie Menschen eben sind. 

Es ist natürlich ein übertriebenes Argument alle über einen Kamm zu scheren. Dahinter verbirgt sich aber der Ärger darüber, dass selbst straffällige Asylbewerber bzw. Personen mit ausländischem Pass in den seltensten Fällen wirklich aufgrund ihrer Straftaten abgeschoben werden. So bleiben eben auch die Kriminellen und prägen den Ruf der nicht kriminellen Asylbewerber.

&gt;#10 Manche Eigentümer sagen: «Nein zum Heim! Sonst verliert unser Haus an Wert!«

&gt;Richtig ist: Wohnungen für Flüchtlinge machen es allen Seiten leichter. 

Jetzt mal was aus persönlicher Erfahrung: Die Unterkünfte bzw. die Verteilung der Flüchtlinge auf einzelne Wohnungen oder ähnliches ist aus vielerlei Hinsicht ein Problem:

1. Die steigenden Mieten. Es steht nur ein bestimmter Satz an Mietkosten für einen Flüchtling/Asylbewerber bereit. Die in den letzten Jahren steigenden Mieten haben diesen weit überschritten, besonders wenn man den Flüchtling nicht mit Ofenheizung und Klo im Freien unterbringen will.

2. Eine effektive Versorgung/Organisation der Flüchtlinge ist mit massiver Verwaltung verbunden, die nur noch weiter ausufert wenn diese nicht zentral untergebracht werden.

3. Der Staat und damit der Steuerzahler bürgt für die Flüchtlinge und kommt für eventuelle Schäden auf. Oft treffen Flüchtlinge aus Dritte Welt Ländern zum ersten Mal auf Wasserhähne, Heizungen und ähnliches und verbrauchen dementsprechend weit über den Eigenbedarf hinaus. Der Wasserhahn läuft halt immer wie die Quelle daheim, die Temperatur in der Wohnung wird durch das öffnen des Fensters und nicht durch das Herunterregeln der Heizung reguliert. 

4. Die Asyllobby stemmt sich mit aller Macht gegen eine dezentrale Unterbringung. Ihr ist es am liebsten wenn Heime weiterhin privat betrieben werden, denn dann ist das meiste Geld mit dem geringsten Aufwand zu machen. Flüchtlinge sind ein Wirtschaftsgut und die Asylindustrie nutzt dieses massiv aus.

5. Die Betreuung von Flüchtlingen ist nur mit massiven Mehrkosten zu stemmen. Will man nicht, dass die Familien verwahrlosen oder sich überhaupt nicht zurecht finden, ist eine Betreuung unumgänglich. Man überlege sich jetzt die Flüchtlinge würden auf Wohnungen aufgeteilt, zu denen jeweils ein Betreuer fährt bzw. die Flüchtlinge bekommen Mittel gestellt um zu einer Zentralstelle für Integrationskurse und ähnliches zu fahren. Kontrolle wieder bei denen die nicht kommen, wieder mehr Verwaltung, wieder mehr Kosten.

Es gibt gewichtige Gründe die gegen eine Unterbringung sprechen. Hauptgrund sind wie immer die Kosten sowie die Lobbypolitik der Asylindustrie.

&gt;#11 Geizige meinen: »So viele Flüchtlinge aufzunehmen können wir uns nicht leisten«

&gt;Richtig ist: Menschenrechte zu beachten kostet Geld. Und das können wir uns leisten. Zudem können Flüchtlinge viel leisten - wenn man sie lässt. 

Stellt die Systemfrage. Wozu ist der Staat denn da? Im Augenblick um es der Wirtschaft und den Eliten so angenehm wie möglich zu machen. So funktioniert unsere marktkonforme Demokratie. Klar ist es heuchlerisch sich dennoch immer moralisch aufzuspielen und anderen etwas vorzuwerfen, wenn man es nicht einmal hinbekommt den Waffenexport in Krisenländer zu unterbinden. So funktioniert aber das System. Die Belange der Wirtschaft stehen über denen der Menschen. Entweder das ändert sich für alle oder es ändert sich für niemanden.

&gt;#12 Unwissende denken: »Zuwanderer gefährden unseren Sozialstaat«

&gt;Richtig ist: Ohne Einwanderung sehen wir alt aus. 

Diese demografischen Gründe wurden angeführt um die Rente zu zerstören, sie wurden angeführt um die Jungen gegen die alten auszuspielen, die Sozialleistungen zu kürzen. Es ist eben so eine Lüge wie der Fachkräftemangel. Einwanderung macht dieses Land nicht jung, es ist auch nicht Ziel, dass die Märkte weiterhin junge Arbeitskräfte haben.

Biokapazität: 1.92

Differenz: -3.16

das heißt die aktuelle Population verbraucht mehr als das Land ökologisch nachhaltig verkraften kann und konsumiert auf Kosten zukünftiger Generationen und auf Kosten anderer Länder

B) Population verringern um 62%

C) Lebensstandard verrringern um 62%

D) Ausbeutung von anderen Ländern intensivieren

A) C) &amp; D) sind imho keine wünschenswerte ""Alternative""

&gt; The government set limits on net foreign exchange assets for state-owned exporters, while officials and banking sources said the central bank had installed supervisors at the currency trading desks of top state banks.
&gt;
Economists said the measures were effectively a softer version of capital controls, but that President Vladimir Putin, who has drawn much of his popularity from financial stability and rising prosperity, would keep his pledge not to resort to full-fledged controls.
&gt;
""They have already forced government exporters to sell their dollars, and same will happen for banks I guess, so in a sense, capital controls are already in place,"" said Sergei Guriev, an exiled economist who fled Russia after criticizing the Kremlin.

On Tuesday, the Russian government told large state exporting companies that by March 1 they must bring their net foreign exchange assets back to the levels of Oct. 1 and report to the central bank on a weekly basis.
&gt;
""Of course, the companies are free to hold on to the hard currency, they are also free to get involved in speculative operations. But then we reserve the right not to help them if and when they hit tough times,"" said one government source.

false,Krawall2,null,null,"#13 Nazis propagieren: »Durch Zuwanderung geht die deutsche Kultur zugrunde«

&gt;Richtig ist: ""Überfremdet"" sind wir schon immer. 

Dieses ""Eigentlich kommen wir alle aus Afrika-"" Argument ist purer Hohn. Wenn man sich eingehender mit deutscher Geschichte befassen würde, insbesondere der vor 33, dann würde man durchaus feststellen, dass es in Deutschland eine blühende, germanische und später auch deutsche Kultur gab. Dank der Umerziehung seit 45 und dem ständigen einreden der Totalschuld ist davon nicht mehr viel übrig, man schweigt lieber tot oder befasst sich gar nicht mehr damit. 

Diese Argument ""Durch Zuwanderung geht die deutsche Kultur zugrunde"" ist nämlich aus diesem Grund nicht mehr haltbar. Es gibt nur noch kleine Teile der germanischen Kultur in der deutschen Selber und auch diese verschwinden zusehends. Die deutsche Kultur die sich bis heute etabliert hat unterscheidet sich kaum von denen anderer europäischer Staaten. Bisschen mehr arbeitssam, wesentlich weniger patriotisch. Die Unterschiede sind marginal. Da zu behaupten etwas ändere sich durch noch mehr Zuwanderung ist Quatsch. In Abrede zu stellen, dass dies mal anders war ebenso.

&gt;#14 Engherzige denken: »Wir sollten uns lieber um unsere eigenen Armen kümmern.«

&gt;Richtig ist: Das Problem der Armen ist die ungleiche Verteilung des Wohlstands. 

Erneut, stellt die Systemfrage. Auch will ich mal auf etwas hinweisen, wo Flüchtlinge und Illegale wirklich direkt den Deutschen das Essen wegnehmen. Man schaue bitte in all die Obdachlosenhilfseinrichtungen, die öffentlichen Küchen, die Kleiderausgaben etc.

Dort finden sich neben mehr und mehr Deutschen auch mehr und mehr Flüchtlinge, Asylbewerber und Illegale ein. Vereint in ihrer Armut. Was der eine nicht bekommt, hat der andere sich genommen. 

Kein Deutscher würde sich über Flüchtlinge beschweren, lebte er selbst im Wohlstand. Aber gerade weil immer mehr Menschen selbst auf die elementarste Hilfe angewiesen sind, die auch Flüchtlinge und andere in Anspruch nehmen, werden auch deren Kapazitäten knapp. 

Man versucht hier immer jemanden aus der Mittelschicht als normalen Deutschen heranzuziehen, dem ja nichts durch den Flüchtling weggenommen wird. Das ist richtig. Jemand der Akademiker ist, einen gutbezahlten Job hat, in Dahlem wohnt und ein Ferienhaus in Italien hat, dem wird nichts weggenommen werden. 

Aber einem ständig wachsenden Teil der verarmenden deutschen Bevölkerung wird genommen. Denjenigen, die keine Arbeit haben, die obdachlos sind, die auf Hilfe angewiesen sind um ihren Hunger zu stillen, die ohne Tafeln nicht ihre Familien ernähren können. Denen wird genommen, weil die selben Einrichtungen in Anspruch nehmen und die nicht unendlich viel zu vergeben haben.

Ich würde nie fordern man solle Flüchtlinge davon ausschließen. Es geht hier um Dinge wie Kleidung, Brot, absolute Grundbedürfnisse die Deutsche wie Flüchtlinge nicht mehr befriedigt bekommen. Hier stimmt etwas ganz anderes nicht. Der deutsche Staat ist in erster Linie für die deutschen Bürger da. Wenn er bereits derart versagt diese aus der Armut raus zu halten, wie kann man da fordern auch Flüchtlinge in diese Armut zu verbringen? Es ist menschenunwürdig was hier geschieht.

&gt;#15 Kaltherzige sagen: »Abgelehnte Asylbewerber sofort abschieben!«

&gt;Richtig ist: Viele Abschiebungen unterbleiben aus sehr guten Gründen. 

Es ist mitunter zu viel verlangt jemanden abzuschieben der straffällig geworden ist, dessen Antrag abgelehnt wurde und der in seinem Herkunftsland ebenfalls als Straftäter gesucht wird. Ein schnelles Aslyverfahren welches einen definitiven und dann auch schnell vollzogenen Ausgang kennt, welches für die Bewerber transparent ist würde auch nicht zu solchen Schicksalen führen. Da gibt es auch massig Lösungen, die alle durch die Asyllobby blockiert werden. Jemand der nicht hier ist bringt eben keinen Profit mehr.",0,1419535696,null,0,false,0,cn56jnu,t3_2qdljb,t1_cn56jnu,t3_2qdljb,null,1425220141,-2,false,de,t5_22i0,-2

false,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt; You want to have a tax on buying stocks? How are you going to do that?

""Aandelen aan toonder"" have been illegal to sell for a while now. Buying stock is official and registered.

&gt;Besides if such a tax was enforced most rich people would just move their money to other countries and leave Belgium altogether.

You don't read what I write, do you? I just said that the practical example of the introduction of such a tax in France shows that barely 1% of the wealth is moved abroad, and most of it to the neighbouring countries. Your gloom and doom prediction is simply fearmongering.

&gt;The taxes haven't gone up for the middle and lower classes, in fact they have decreased slightly.

But the cost of living has gone up and the wages have been cut, so the budgets of the middle and lower classes are more strained now.

&gt;Not only that but wealth tax also destroys one of the core principles our society is founded on.

What ""core principle""? The principle that the peasants have to suffer for the comfort of the nobility?

&gt;Implementing a wealth tax is basically a ways for the government to take away our right of owning our own money and our access to the free market.

It's just a tax. Don't be hysterical.

&gt;It's not defeatism, it's being realistic. It's stupid to inforce laws if you know that it won't have any effects or even have negative effects.

They won't have negative effects. You just claim they will have negative effects.

Why do you think people who make money with money shouldn't be taxed on their income, and people who make money by working should be taxes very harshly? Do you want to discourage people to work?

First: I don't think you understand what 'humanism' is. Humanism is a philosophy that says we should focus on human life instead of divinity. It was a thing invented in the Renaissance, when people started to write and paint less about religious topics, and more about down to Earth topics.

Now, for someone pretending to see where 'our civilization' is going, you know not that much about where our civilization has been. Don't mind me if I don't trust your feeling for direction.

Also: When has shooting people trying to cross a border become something we do? We did that in Europe between 1945 and 1989.

Safe from what though? You yourself admit that there is no war nor famine in Morocco. Diseases exist in Europe too (some of them are even brought across the border from illegal immigrants), the same way that hospitals exist in Morocco. Is Morocco not good enough?

Looks to me like they aren't desperately fleeing from something, they simply want a better life in Europe. Nobody can blame them for that, I don't neither. But if you want to immigrate, please do it through the proper channels and don't storm fences and clash with the police. Some might say that this is only happening because the authorities don't let everyone in, if they try to go through the proper channels. But then one must also ask himself, if it isn't perfectly fine for a country to decide who is being let onto its territory and who is not. The behaviour that is being displayed at the borders is extremely alarming, because what those Africans try to do is to take by force what they want (in this case, entrance into Spanish territory).

Sorry, but next to the fact that seemingly everyone got another definition of racism, the leading definition is simply treating someone unequal because of the colour of their skin.

The question you have to ask yourself is this: is someone that is dark of skin (banal as this way of thinking is, but let's go on) a victim of discrimination when he or she becomes victim to a crime? Of course you already know the answer: no, not necessarily. What matters here is the *motive* of the arson, and only after that has become clear can one say whether this is racism or a hate crime because a certain person/group dislikes muslims.

So be very wary about judging what is going on here.

&gt; You yourself admit that there is no war nor famine in Morocco.

And I also said that that doesn't mean there's no reason to flee from Morocco. Morocco isn't as bad as countries go for it's inhabitants or for it's tourists, but it's a bad country for people who are there illegally. They know that illegal immigrants are at least given a chance in Europe, they're at least treated humanely. In Morocco the situation isn't good AT ALL.

http://www.ibtimes.com/europes-door-black-african-migrants-trapped-hellish-limbo-morocco-1404846

There is no famine or civil war in Morocco, but as I said those aren't the only things a person can flee from. Political repression, violations of human rights (Happens in Morocco, see source)

&gt; Looks to me like they aren't desperately fleeing from something, they simply want a better life in Europe.

Seriously? Of course they want a better life in Europe. Why would you flee to a place where you have a worse life? They are fleeing from their lives in Africa, Morocco isn't safe for them either, so they look towards Europe. They're fleeing from their bad lives, to the good life, which is Europe. They either live in poverty, political repression or as a minority towards which atrocities or taking place, they flee to Europe because they know political repression, disease and hate crimes aren't common there.

&gt; But if you want to immigrate, please do it through the proper channels and don't storm fences and clash with the police.

I agree, but this is no reason to pretend its 'an invasion'. An invasion is an attack, these people aren't attacking, they're fleeing. Saying they're invading insinuates two things: They're either an enemy or they're a pest. They're neither. I agree that immigration should be done through legal measures, but you need to understand that these people do not have evil in mind, and sometimes the legal ways of immigration aren't open to them.

&gt; But then one must also ask himself, if it isn't perfectly fine for a country to decide who is being let onto its territory and who is not.

It is, but that doesn't mean countries should treat the immigrants as an enemy. They should be dealt with humanely and not be treated as a pest.

&gt; What makes you think that this mindset of taking by force will magically disappear once they are in Europe?

&gt; he didn't say anything about killing muslims is right

As I've said several times now, it's *implied*. Whether you're just pretending not to understand how coded language works or really don't understand, I don't know, but it makes it hard to work out if you're trolling or not. Basically, imagine this: I kill my neighbour. He's a muslim. He wasn't doing anything bad, he wasn't breaking any laws, he wasn't hurting anyone, he wasn't bothering me, he was just sitting in his house (like those muslims were just sitting in their mosque) and I set it on fire and he died. If someone then says about my committing of that murder: ""I don't blame him for killing that man for no other reason than the fact that he was a muslim, I blame the government for allowing that neighbour to have been there in the first place"", then clearly what that person is *really* saying is: ""the neighbour deserved what he got because he is a muslim, so if you think the neighbour shouldn't have been killed just for being a muslim, then blame the government that allowed that neighbour to live there in the first place, because then I can agree with you because I think he shouldn't have been allowed to be in the country anyway"", basically saying that killing muslims for being muslims is acceptable, so there is no ""bad guy"" in this situation; which in the case of a murder means that the ""bad guy"" is the dead one: my neighbour. Basically, ""if he didn't want to get killed he shouldn't have been there, so blame the government that allowed him to be there, but don't blame the guy who killed him"", which is disgusting logic that attempts to excuse the criminal by saying the victim basically had no right to be existing there in the first place. 

&gt; just blaming the government for allowing this multiculturalism to happen, which in turn will make some Swedes turn to extreme measures.

the situation we're talking about is one of a person setting fire to a mosque. Someone pro-actively trying to kill people for the sole reason that they are muslims. This wasn't an immigration-matter, it wasn't a protest vs an anti-protest, it was just a guy who said ""I'm going to set fire to this mosque, because the people inside it are muslims"". That's not a reaction to multiculturalism, that's attempted mass-murder inspired by bigotry, and trying to explain it away as a ""normal reaction to multiculturalism"" is disgusting, which is why I took issue with that commenter, who tried to do exactly that. 

Edited to add: The person who carried out this attack is to blame. Not the government, not immigration, not multiculturalism. If someone tries to kill someone else because of their religion, that's a vile act of bigotry, not a reasonable response to multiculturalism.

Another possibility: your stop is not served by all trains. It may be that you boarded an RE train instead of an RB train, for example. Or it may be that certain trains on the timetable simply aren't scheduled to stop there.

Also bear in mind that the annual revision of the timetables took place on 14th December this year, so the service you use may not be running quite as you're used to.

Without knowing anything about what kind of train you took or which station you wanted to alight at, it's hard to give concrete advice.

Please. The nordic countries are pretty much the same ethnicity, however Danes, Swedes and Norwegians have waged wars through centuries. There is much less difference between a Swede, a Dane and a Norwegian than hutu and tutsu.

Furthermore Finns were discriminated quite a lot by Swedes, even though they were in the same empire.

The only real ethnic difference would be in the sami people, and those were also discriminated against in the past by Swedes.

Well, what you are talking about is an umbrella term, called discrimination. The term 'race' explictly implies a certain bloodline, which makes racism intrinsically connected to it. I don't know if there is a different definition being taught about racism in German schools nowadays, but this isn't exactly the mainstream legal way of defining racism here.

For example, if you were to say that I , a Dutchman, became the victim of racism because I was (for example again) violently attacked because I'm Dutch this would be rather weird. Simply because I have Dutch, Italian and Indonesian blood flowing through my veins, which shows one of the flaws of linking nationality to 'race'. The word race should be interpreted not as extremely extensively as we're seeing now.

The police have a duty to do something, they determined what he did *might* be against the law so they arrested him under suspicion of committing that crime. 

He was bailed. 

The police will now investigate if he actually broke the law (In which case he'll be charged with the crime and go to court) or if he didn't (In which case he'll be de-arrested)

- 1499 - Switzerland wins the Swabian War and gains de facto independence from the Holy Roman Empire. It won't be fully recognised until 1648). This turns Switzerland into a peaceful island within a waring Europe. 

- 1798 - Swiss Revolution, Farmers and peasantry revolt in the wake of the Napoleonic wars as the French support them. The new Helvetic Republic is established as a puppet of the French Empire. 

- 1848 - The Federal State is formed. Switzerland comes into existence as we know it today. The new Federal constitution combines elements of the US Constitution and of the French Constitution. 

- 1874 - End of the Kulturkampf - leads to the separation of church and state. Marriages, birth and death are now regulated by the state.  


- 1891 - Direct democracy is fully introduced. 50'000 signatures (Today 100'000) are needed to demand a vote on a change to the constitution or laws.

- 1945 - End of the 2nd World War. Switzerland survives the 2nd World War as a neutral country surrounded by the Axis by maintaining trade with Nazi Germany and allowing banks to work with Germany. Switzerland ensures the survival of 150'000 refugees. 1945 marks the beginning of great prosperity in Switzerland that pretty much remains until today. 


- 1971 - Woman's suffrage is introduced on a national level after a national vote, the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden and Appenzell Ausserrhoden will take another 19 years to fully implement it. The first cantons to introduce it on a canton level were Vaud and Neuchatel in 1959, the first German speaking canton was Basel-City in 1966. 

- 1992 - Switzerland decides not to join the EU after a national vote. The application is rejected by 50.3% to 49.7%. In 2005 Switzerland joins the Schengen Area, but remains outsides of the EU.

For instance, if you go on the website of the [Saxony Studienkolleg](http://www.stksachs.uni-leipzig.de/voraussetzungen.html), it'll tell you you need a ""Bedingte Vorzulassung zum Fachstudium"", which is basically the admission letter with the condition of completing a year at the Studienkolleg.

Your chances would probably depend on your application form, i.e. your school results and your German skills, but I think a lot of students would get forwarded to the Studienkolleg, since it's the SK grades that'll count later on (for further university applications).

I take it you're only studying the language at the moment. I wouldn't know about the specifics of the M-Course requirements in general, but the SK I went to also had the math entry test for the M-Course ([here](http://www.stksachs.uni-leipzig.de/aufnahmetest.html)). Are you preparing for that? 

Depending on how far along you are, I'd probably recommend to start looking at what universities you want to apply to, check their application process and get some of the basic documents prepared (since you're not German, you might need to apply throgh uni-assist).

&gt; Prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one’s own race is superior.

Whatever it might be: there are wildly different opinions floating around regarding the actual meaning of the word racism. That has pretty much influenced my opinion that the word should be abolished all together and simply replaced by discrimination. Discrimination is clear in its meaning by default: distinguishing between people. As you already have shown by linking to another topic: the use of racism often leads to discussion about whether the word is applicable or not. Use discrimination and you're done with it. 

Also, we're talking about something which definition should in my opinion as a legal scholar should be sought in law. Once again, equal to how the Dutch define racism in their law system, the definition in law is [much less](http://thelawdictionary.org/racism/) broad as you are giving here. 

Sadly, I couldn't find the German legal definition of racism, but maybe I can find it later on. There is no use talking about the crime of racism, if the type of 'racism' you are referring to isn't actual legal racism. 

And once again, this might be the most important thing I have to say: I find it peculiar how you warp the word 'race' into something that has to do with culture, religion and so on. It is really weird and outside of normal grammatical interpretation. In my opinion years of completely wrong use of the word of racism has done that much.

**UNITED KINGDOM**

* **[1707.05.01](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1707)**  
The Acts of Union joins England and Scotland into the Kingdom of ""Great Britain"" (which also included Ireland, already part of England). Together they will create a huge empire and give a massive contribution to science and engineering with discoveries and investment that fuelled the Industrial Revolution. They will also bring German nobility to rule the UK - George I (born Georg Ludwig in Hanover, member of the House of Hanover). In those days, everything German = good.

* **[1917.07.17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Windsor)**  
Due to anti-German feelings caused by WW1, King George changes the family name he inherited from his father, Prince Albert Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, who had married Queen Victoria of the House of Hanover (both of them spoke German at home) to Windsor to try and sound more English. From then on, anything German = bad.

* **[1922.12.06](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Irish_Treaty)**  
The Anglo-Irish Treaty comes into effect - most of Ireland secedes. It signals the beginning of the end for the British empire - the Balfour Declaration of 1926, the Statute of Westminster 1931, Indian independence in 1947 will follow. By the 1960s the British Empire was history.


* **[1945.05.08](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_in_Europe_Day)**  
VE-Day. After a shaky start, and despite the elite's flirting with nazism, Britain and the Allies well and truly kick Germany's arse. They still bang on obsessively about it.

* **[1949.04.04](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO#Beginnings)**  
The North Atlantic Treaty is signed. It is now clear to everyone that the US has truly replaced the UK as a world player, although the UK tries to lessen the blow by claiming a *special relationship* (hint: *everybody* claims a special relationship with the US, from Egypt to Germany to Israel. Spying on everyone else in Europe and passing the findings on to the yanks won't help, so stop it!)

* **[1965.10.26](http://www.beatlesinterviews.org/db1965.1026.beatles.html)**  
The Beatles are awarded MBEs. It's the rise of British cool, based non on military might but creativity expressed through music, fashion, movie, and the ability to market it. 

* **[1966.07.30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1966_FIFA_World_Cup_Final)**  
~~VE-Day 2~~ England beats Germany in the final on home soil to win their only FIFA World Cup to date. Highbrows where raised at the refereeing. Regardless, they still bang on obsessively about it. 

* **[1969.01.??](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch#Activities_in_the_United_Kingdom)**  
~~King~~ Rupert Murdoch buys his first newspaper in the UK. From then on he will dominate British political life, [ensuring victories for the Tories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_The_Sun_Wot_Won_It), becoming a great mate of Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair (who became godfather to his daughter) and of course [David Cameron](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/leveson-inquiry/9227491/David-Camerons-five-secret-meetings-with-Rupert-Murdoch.html) -  the first person he met  in Downing Street [when elected as PM, before he had even moved in, was none other than good old Rupe](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61404/media-engagements-may-2010-present.pdf) 

* **[1975.06.05](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975)**    
Britain votes in a referendum to join the the EU. Thatcher and the Tories were in favour, Labour against. They have been trying to get out ever since, Thatcher being one of the most fervent Eurosceptics. They still bang on obsessively about it.

* **[1990.11.28](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher#Prime_Minister_.281979.E2.80.931990.29)**  
After 11 years in power, Margaret Thatcher's cabinet turns against her and deposes her - the main reason being (surprise surprise!) relationship with the EU. In those few years she completely revolutionised the country, turning it into a neoliberal experiment with powerless trade unions (to Murdoch's delight), among other things. She also won a rebate for UK's EU contributions. All the PMs who followed her, ~~especially~~ including New Labour ones, have followed the path she pioneered.

* **[1992.02.20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League)**  
After Thatcher had cleansed British football of the hooligan problem, the top football competition in England becomes a private corporation, the Premier League, a money spinning machine intertwined for many years with Murdoch's satellite TV empire. In a 10 years it has became the world's most watched football league, whose earnings dwarf those of the other major leagues - combined. 

* **[2014.09.18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence_referendum%2C_2014)**  
The British establishment (including the shamefully partisan BBC) manage to convince the Scots that they should stay in the Union with England and the rest. Just as well, as oil prices, Independent Scotland's likely main source of income, have been going down faster than a lass in Magaluf trying to get free drinks.

My purpose was not to count numerally or otherwise who was baddest. 

My sentence meant that white supremacy derives from the history of white domination: whites have opressed other continents, thus a ""superior race"", and should continue to be like that. Black supremacy, on the other hand, derives from the history of being colonized and enslaved: blacks have been inferior, and finally it's their turn to establish a Black Supremacy. You see the differene in the ideological construction?

In this sense, Japanese were perhaps closer to white supremacy considering power relations in that area. But you see, different ""supremacies"" are genuinely different if you consider them historical and ideological formations rather than abstract, ahistorical principles.

&gt; Also...well, duh Europe is dominated by whites. It's the continent white people come from. Asia is doninated by Asian people's too. I don't see your point here, to be honest.

&gt; I don't see why you insist on rhetorical tricks to shield them from the label they deserve.

I *don't* take bigots into protection. What I loathe however is people that wrongfully use the word racism (or any other term in that matter). Why? Because it makes someone look clumsy and unintelligible. Above all: this word is often being used with a political goal in mind, which makes me highly annoyed from time to time. I think I do not need to go into detail about the fact that completely innocent people are being called racist from time to time as well, simply because the people that cherish it so much like to throw it around at will.

I don't know how it is arranged over there, but here discriminating is *just* as deplorable as its subcategory 'racism' (indeed, however vague that might be). In that way there can be no talk about 'shielding'. 

About rhetorics, you make a mistake in reasoning though:

&gt; ...do just that: generalise the entirety of Muslims, painting the entire group as a homogeneous bloc with one goal.  They are textbook racists and can and should be called out as such.

You link portraying a group as a homogenous bloc to racism. Why is really beyond me here, as we are simply talking about a group of people that share the same beliefs.  Not a 'race', and I'm noticing the same extensive interpretation as the other guy in this topic is using here. Whatever it is: I have never seen Muslims as being framed as a 'people' or something close to it. Framed as sectarians, possible barbarians and backwards people? Sure that happened, but not the type of framing you're talking about.

Non so a quali vaghi ""definizioni"" ti riferisci, ma al massimo è vero il contrario - in un paese anglosassone Tavecchio sarebbe stato buttato fuori a calci in culo dieci minuti dopo aver parlato di banane, altro che farlo presidente della Federcalcio (infatti sia la UEFA che la FIFA lo hanno punito). E se un politico avesse fatto battutine su Obama ""abbronzato"" si sarebbe dovuto dimettere al massimo dopo un paio di giorni. E vogliamo parlare del trattamento riservato a Kyenge?

Take the test if you can afford it, it will nail down your ancestry down to a certain region in europe if need be, and display influences from other European regions(that is if you're of european stock) with an incredibly accurate percentage(there's 1 percent error margin, which is miniscule). 


&gt;So why is it even useful or interesting to try to categorize them? Who cares?

Perhaps because they EXIST? Why should we study complex phenomena like quasars, theoretical wormholes and what not? Who cares?


&gt;It sounds that it will be some kind of fascist junta which says what is significant and what is not.

No, not really. I'm against any form of imperialism or chauvinism, although I'm not so sure the same could be said about anarchist society(which won't last long for obvious reasons). Plus, there's no need to measure these things because one can clearly see if somebody has ''significant'' non-european admixture. 


&gt;You know that this isn't actually science? It is just mumble-jumble with some high school biology knowledge without any sources or anything.

You really shouldn't listen to a sociology professor rambling about biology and what not. Humans cluster into clearly defined groups, just because there are gray zones(this only proves that we're the same species because we can interbreed) or because you don't like the term race doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.

Generally Italians don't speak English very well and are very self conscious about it. So they may be happy to talk to you one to one, but in a group they may not want to risk being the one with the worst English.

Also, Italian is a language very rich in nuances, a lot of humour and little touches are untranslatable, therefore people fallback naturally to Italian. It happened to me recently abroad, 3 Italians + 1 foreigner (in her country), all fluent English speakers, we tried our best to speak English but we kept falling back on Italian as we just wanted to use those little nuances.

&gt; You are not one of them and you'll hardly ever will.

No, no they don't. Have you actually looked around? DNA-test is horribly bad indicator of any individual's behaviour and your ""races"" seem to be highly heterogenous in their qualities (incl. looks and behaviour) as well. I still don't see any common factor.

false,ggow,SCOT,Scotland,"&gt;hsr is a luxury, we should first cover our basic needs.

HSR isn't all that much more expensive than conventional rail to build, so if you're building new infrastructure, and it covers the right range, it can make more sense to just build HSR instead of conventional rail. Writing it off as a luxury ignores that you might then, in the future, be looking at very expensive upgrades and so on. 

Having just looked at the route between Berlin and Warsaw, it looks like it currently takes 5h30minutes, and runs three times a day. Conventional wisdom regarding rail is that it becomes more competitive  than air travel if you bring the journey times under three hours. Conceivably, that could be achieved here, and induce large modal shift from air to rail. Such rail connections also usually boost what we/(the press) call 'northshoring' in the UK, which is the movement of back office functions from expensive city locations (e.g. London/Berlin) to cheaper, well connected cities (e.g. Manchester/Warsaw). This piece of infrastructure may well have a very strong effect on promoting growth in Poland's services sector. 

Additionally, cross-border infrastructure like this can often qualify for special help from the EU, lowing the relative cost to the Polish Government, in comparison to completely domestic infrastructure projects that wouldn't necessarily qualify by virtue of being domestic only. 

TL;DR These projects have a lot of moving pieces and factors, more than any one man can keep track of. It's not as simple as writing HSR off as a luxury. We really ought to wait for the study before making any judgement on whether this is, or is not, worth it as a project for the Polish Government to pursue.

When someone does evil, they should be lambasted for that evil. But human history is filled with terrible actions done by communities when economic breakdown occurs.

Was the Great Depression a factor (not the sole cause) in the events that led to the Second World War? I am not a historian but I think it was a factor. 

When things go bad, politicians will appear that demand the country to unite (i.e. shut up and do what we say, no matter how insane an idea it is... how facism starts), they have foreign ""issues"" to keep their population distracted from domestic problems. 

And with respect to domestic problems they point at a group and say ""they're the cause"" and many people who feel humiliated and hurt at the pain of economic destruction just want an easy answer, a target for their anger. And then, over a few steps of years/decades, shit goes bad.

Imagine two politicians explaining to you why the economy has collapsed. One says ""This is a terrible chain of events from many different sectors, trade being down, tax revenue declining due to lose of profits, poor speculation of markets, government not anticipating the problem, the population being too far in debt that when things went wrong individuals had no savings/assets to withstand the collapse, and government making austerity cuts. No one person or group can be blamed. Let us work together to get back to our best.""

Then politician number 2 goes: ""It's the (insert the rich/religious group/race/foreign power/political ideology!!!!!""

Politician 1 wins most of the time in history, but when a population is angry, hungry and suffering, politician 2 starts to seem more palatable. It may not happen in a day, or a month, or even a year, but slowly that group mentioned as a cause begins to suffer. Even in our enlightened time in many nations of the world having free democracies I don't doubt the appeal of fear during economic recessions/depressions. 

So to an immigrant youth who's jobless, if he's stupid he can fall for the ""Muslims unite! Things were better in the Caliphate"" nonsense the Islamists throw out. But at the same time, the cultured, civilised, rich (in economy and education) democratic nations suffering a longer economic and social problems (I don't deny there are social issues) a youth who's struggling to make it in a tough world for jobs and social respect, if he's stupid, can be swayed by the ""Look at those immigrants, things were so much better without them!"" even if both rhetorics can't exactly explain every problem the society has (and it can't because it's much more complex).

Now is it due to a decent person losing control out of anger and fear and not truly believing it in his/her heart, or does it tap to (all humans potentially, but not necessarily, having) a residual hate one already had for another group... I don't know.

I do think the appeal to hate attracts a minority of people no matter what nation we're discussing, and the rest are dragged along with it if things go bad.

When you increase supply in the lowest rungs of the economic ladder (that is, minimum wage jobs) you increase the workforce available to the economy, and overall the economy grows. Problem is, those on the bottom of the ladder are now facing more competition. 

In other words, the economy might grow, but unemployment *increases* (at least temporarily) for minimum-wage workers. You're adding a disproportionate number of people to a very specific section of the economy, so that section becomes saturated.

That's not why Nazi Germany didn't invade Switzerland.

Hitler hated Switzerland even if Switzerland gave him access to financial markets for liquidity. He called it a *""pimple on the face of Europe""* and would go into rages when he heard about the Swiss shooting down German planes who strayed into Swiss airspace. Although to be fair they would shoot down allied planes who violated their airspace as well, it was probably more personal for Hitler, given the idea of Germans shooting down other Germans in German planes.

No, what *really* prevented Hitler from moving against Switzerland was Switzerland's military preparedness. A population that was prepared to be readily mobilized at any time, important tunnel/bridge border tunnels already being mined &amp; a strongly fortified redoubt in the mountains where the Swiss military could easily withdraw too proved the difference.

Well, that and the fact that Hitler's main goal was to destroy the Soviet Union. Having to save Italy in Greece &amp; the Balkans delayed Barbossa by a season or two *(IIRC)* and the occupation that followed proved a sizable drain on resources, especially in Yugoslavia, until the war's very end.

What? Yes they do, Europeans are their descendants. Do you even know who indo-europeans are? This is important because you seem like you don't know what you're talking about.

&gt;DNA-test is horribly bad indicator of any individual's behaviour 

DNA test determines ancestry, not behaviour. Behaviour is determined by neuroscience and genetic research in general.

&gt;and your ""races"" seem to be highly heterogenous in their qualities (incl. looks and behaviour) as well. 

Human 'races' are heterogenous, unique and diverse. I don't see how this goes against my statement.


&gt;And again, I still can't see why person's outfit should be taken into account in politics. In which political question is it relevant? Not to mention that this ""race""-category doesn't even tell anything about it, but offers some arbitrary average which doesn't describe any living person.

Because denying reality and scientific results never works, and ignoring it will eventually fuck us over. Racial differences are a taboo nowadays because of politics and ideologies. We won't be able to turn the other way for long anymore. In the next decade or two this will have to be discussed because the state of our societies will require it.


&gt;I just used them as an example to show that the race itself has nothing to do with the subject at hand - just like hair or moles don't have. It's meaningless to talk about them when we consider politics (or arsons like now).

Mole is a benign formation on one's skin and hair is a protein filament that can be found in all animals. You're mixing apples and oranges. This has nothing to do with the fact that different races practice different selection/breeding strategies that result in neurological and physiological differences.

&gt;this has nothing to do with races or DNA-tests.  ""own people"" is territorial issue. We can run a village without knowing our ancestries, can't we?

Yes it does, every group of people puts their own kind in the first place. Asian 'tribes' stick together, so do Semitic, African etc.. this goes beyond race and includes culture as well. Muslims take care of other muslims, Jews take care of other Jews etc... The only group of people that doesn't display this behaviour are well-off liberal Westerners. We all know how this ends. Those who will not protect and fight for their own will eventually be eaten by those who will fight. 


&gt;Also, you know that we have quite complex legal system and advanced production and exchange system. D**on't you think we should get new organizing principles, and forget about those apes and tribes?** What can they offer to contemporary problems?

Who wouldn't? This isn't a question should we do it or not, but is it even possible? Just because we evolved and developed higher intelligence than chimpanzees doesn't mean that we can just take our primal instincts and throw them out the window.

It's a huge problem and it is putting democratic ideals to the test since  it is absolutely true that religions conservatism and extremism is not compatible with mainstream German and European values.

&gt; cosa intendi con questa parola? 

Cosa intendo con ""risorse"" ? Oppure con Laissez-faire ? 

Immaginando ""risorse"" intendo l'insieme di competenze, conoscenze e beni materiali.

&gt; con quali soldi? sostenimento cosa intendi? cibo, casa, bollette, libri e vestiti per i bimbi, macchina per andare a lavorare? 

Non entriamo nella specificità dei calcoli matematici, quello necessario secondo me è che una persona deve avere la possibilità di svilupparsi al pieno del proprio potenziale, anche se magari è necessario che per un anno stia a studiare senza produrre valore in modo diretto.

(Essendo più specifici direi di garantire a chiunque ne faccia richiesta una somma di 1500€ a famiglia più bonus per figli con questa cifra intendo che se uno lavora e porta a casa 1100€ al mese li viene concesso un assegno di 400€)

&gt; ma scusa creare delle posizioni remunerative con quei soldi piuttosto di darli a qualcuno che si sviluppi (all´improvviso?)?

Certo, ottima idea, come le creiamo tali posizioni remunerative ? Siamo sicuri che lo stato sia migliore a creare queste posizioni che non i singoli cittadini ?

&gt; in italia l´assistenza sanitaria é universale e le cifre pagate servono a tenere in piedi il sistema sanitario,pagano medici e infermieri, nonché i costi di gestione degli ospedali...uno stipendio invece va al singolo..

Scusami mi sfugge qualcosa, mi devo essere spiegato male, ci riprovo.

L'idea è di dare la possibilità al poveraccio che vive per strada di crearsi una vita da ceto medio, così che non dovrà più vivere per strada e che, non vivendo per strada, avrà meno problemi di salute, il che riduce quanto questo poveraccio pesa sul sistema sanitario nazionale. 

&gt; e nessuno fin´ora ha dimostrato come il reddito di cittadinanza possa fare una cosa del genere...

Non è mai stato fatto su scala nazionale, ma ci sono molto esempi in [scala locale](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2013/05/unconditional_cash_transfers_giving_money_to_the_poor_may_be_the_best_tool.html) che [hanno funzionato](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/10/25/240590433/what-happens-when-you-just-give-money-to-poor-people)

&gt; poi scusami i poveri nei paesi sottosviluppati sono poveri per una mancata redistribuzione del reddito, per sfruttamento da parte di paesi stranieri, per corruzione...se gli dai il redditto di cittadinanza a un pakistano non risolvi nulla

Certamente la mancata distribuzione del reddito è un grave problema, ma ciò non spiega perchè i poveri rimangono poveri, una spiegazione convincente potrebbe essere che i poveri non hanno le risorse per uscire dal loro stato di povertà.

&gt; gli devi creare le strutture per poter lavorare...

Qui secondo me c'è la nostra diversa visione del mondo, se ad un povero senza lavoro trovi un lavoro quello che ottieni è un povero in meno (o comunque qualche povero in meno a seconda di quanto pago tale lavoro) se ai poveri dai la possibilità di svilupparsi succede che tali poveri iniziano a lanciare nuove imprese, che hanno bisogno di personale...

Cosa ne pensi ?

The Marshall Plan is often painted as the key factor that led to the resurgence of the European economies after WW2, but this position is greatly exaggerated. The Marshall Plan was worth the equivalent of 160 billion US$ in today's currency, which, considering it was spread around 16 countries, isn't anything compared to the bailouts and stimulus packages that Europe has seen over the past few years. Not to be ungrateful or anything but the affects of the Marshall Plan were blown out of proportion.

&gt; We also kept the Russians out of Western Europe

Yes, you helped keep the Warsaw Pact alliance out of Western Europe, but you weren't the only country to, NATO was and is a collective effort. The vast majority of the millions and millions of soldiers who were battle-ready along the Iron Curtain were not American troops. The US helped more in terms of nuclear armaments and the MAD strategy. 

&gt; You enjoy the freedom to navigate the seas and the trade that comes with it because our Navy guarantees it.

Your navy helps to guarantee its own national interests first and foremost, the fact that this may benefit other nations is an externality, but European countries do play a role in this as well. European states (at least the non-landlocked ones) have their own navies to patrol their own jurisdictions. 

Anyway, the point of my previous post was to convey that people in European countries shouldn't be guilt-tripped any time they want to criticize the US about legitimate concerns regarding its foreign policy. Any such criticism shouldn't be just automatically branded as ""Anti-Americanism"", as if it were a knee-jerk irrational hatred of the US.

Exclusionary experiences are the prime cause of youth delinquency, both in kids of immigrants as well as organic potatoes. Said experiences are just easier to get by if your last name isn't Schmidt (with that name, you raise your chances a lot if you are a single son of a single, socio-economically not so well of mother). The difference between cultures, if you disregard organic potatoes, is actually relatively small.

You know, Italians, Greeks, but also the whole Balkan, those have a 1-2% higher rate.

...youth delinquency being actually the only problem, here: The adult criminality rates are nearly completely identical.
