true,Gypsiesdonthavehoney,DENK,Denmark,"&gt;Look at france and the creche system. Extensive high quality childcare, and still dismal total fertility rates only buoyed by muslim immigrants from north africa. 

First off: I was kind enough to provide sources and also point out, where I was too lazy to find them. I suggest you do the same -especially when you apparently want to go into a contentious and silly debate.

Here are some sources that contradict your claims.

* [According to Eurostat](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Fertility_statistics), France has a birth rate of 2.03. That's actual one of the highest in Europe - not very ""dismal"".

* Crèches are nowhere as universal as the Scandinavian child care systems. In fact, [almost 20 percent of parents](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/may/21/child-care-costs-compared-britain) in France rely on non-official child care ([often because they can't get a spot](http://www.forbes.com/sites/pascalemmanuelgobry/2013/04/17/4-myths-and-one-truth-about-french-childcare/)) compared to &lt;1 per cent in Scandinavia.

* Muslims made up 7.3 percent of the French population in 2010 with an estimated increase to 10.3 in 2030. That's hardly enought to significantly increase the overall birth rate. Especially when...

* The fertility rate for French muslims is 2.8 (compared to 2.2 in all European muslims). The relatively high birth rate of European muslims can mostly be explained by socio-economic differences. As I pointed out above, the less education and wealth a group posseses, the more likely they are to have more children. Currently, muslims are disproportionately working and underclass. As muslims advance socio-economically, their birth rate drops as well.

true,ZioTron,null,null,"MHM.. what a difficoult question...

Let's try to synthesize:

.


Fascism and Mussolini represent a very **dark time of our past that many of us are ashamed of**.

Even if **a minority**, there is some people who **still respects the person of Mussolini**.

Obviously some of them are **NeoNazis or right wing extremists**, like there are in any country...

The strange thing is that **even** in **the common people** someone still has the feeling that *""Si stava meglio quando si stava peggio""* (It was better when it was worse).

This is due to a couple things in particular:

- The typical **Italian aversion to changes**, that has brought us to use that  sentence through Mussolini, Andreotti, Craxi, Berlusconi, etc...

- **Many feel that Mussolini did good until he allied with Hitler**, after that he lost his ""reason"", effectively exculpating Mussolini of many of his wrongs (and forgetting all the others)

- Mussolini made a **large use of propaganda and media manipulation** giving the impression of a good governement and prosperity.

- Mussolini did indeed **a good number of changes and innovations** 

Many of those changes and innovations **were actually 20-ish years late** in respect many of our european neighbours, and were required if the country wanted to enter the 20th century, like palude sanitation and sewer systems expansion, while others where actually pretty good reforms, like social security system and health assistance, even if made *""in the italian way""* 


PS: Fun fact -  In some of the people who lived during fascism is advisable a certain dualism:

We're recently losing most of them but I had the luck to observe a Tuscan farmer in his natural habitat :P 
(We're talking about a person living in a fraction of a village of 300 souls, the fraction was actually a 2 houses and stables)


He was a partisan, fought to free Italy from fascism but still had the cult of the *Duce*, in his house you could find his weapons and memories from the war along with fascist pictures on the wall saying things like *""E' l'aratro che traccia il solco, ma e' la spada che lo difende""* (The plow draws the furrow, but it's the sword that defends it)

The US has a lot of billionaires, but it also has a fairly high [median income per capita.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_household_income#OECD_Statistics)  

For instance, the gulf between the mega billionaires in the US and the average person might be larger than that of Cambodian millionaires and the average person there. But you would be hard pressed to argue the average Cambodian is better off. 

Also the use of quintiles to measure this is outdated. For instance if an Australian gets a $30,000 raise and an American gets a $30,000 raise, their quality of life increase would be very similar. But the Australian might move up 4 quintiles, where the American might move up one or two. Seems like taking more quality of life factors into account would be a better way to measure changes in income. Quintiles can give skewed social mobility measurements that might not translate into actual difficulty of increasing the quality of one's life.

true,stinkiwinki,null,null,"&gt;Da stellt sich mir doch eigentlich die Frage, warum sich nicht mal jemand hinstellt, den ganzen Lug und Trug aufdeckt

Weil ""die Menschen"" nicht die Wahrheit wollen. 

Natürlich eine alte Leier, aber letztendlich wollen sie, daß die Züge pünktlich fahren, daß Benzin weniger als 1,60 kostet, daß Sohnemann BWL studieren kann, daß Töchterlein einen BWL-Studenten heiratet (oder umgekehrt, man ist ja modern) usw. 

Transparente Politik oder gar Partizipation ist für die meisten Leute wohl gar nicht erstrebenswert. Und diejenigen, die sich irgendeinem Ideal von transparenter Politik verpflichtet fühlen und sich deshalb in den Politikbetrieb begeben, die werden entweder von der Maschine zermahlen, oder stehen am Ende als eines ihrer Zahnräder da. 

Oder um mal wieder das Känguruh zu zitieren: Beim Marsch durch die Institutionen, wird man zum Arsch durch die Institutionen.

Insofern ist wundert es mich gar nicht, daß nicht mehr Leute Transparenz fordern, wenn sie irgendwo doch implizit vermuten, daß das einzige was sie durch Transparenz sehen könnten, eine ziemlich häßliche Fratze wäre. Deshalb werden auch Parteien die sich hauptsächlich mit ""weiter so"" auszeichneten aus gefühlter Alternativlosigkeit mit Mehrheiten von 70% belohnt...

Was mich daher eher wundert, ist daß so selten diskutiert wird, inwieweit das ein Problem ist, daß der repräsentativen Demokratie und besonders der Parteiendemokratie, inhärent ist und welche Schritte praktikabel oder zumindest notwendig wären, um das zu beheben.

Aber gut...vermutlich würde dabei herauskommen, daß es eigentlich schon schiefging als man vor 10.000 Jahren mit Ackerbau und Viehzucht anfing...

&gt;Das Problem ist aber, dass so ein System aus Lügengebilden doch irgendwann einmal in sich zusammenfällt.

It defines you only to the extent when you are ignoring the complicated world image, restricting yourself (for some reason) to the slice presented by ideology.

Naming yourself ""rational"" of course doesn't help - just as you said. Because naming in general is not helping in achieving anything specific, maybe apart from the world of eristic. Basing on facts however, and performing your actions with those in mind, does. Here's where conservatives are failing badly, since in majority they believe in some form of supernatural entity, trying to form the reality with that in mind. 

On the other hand, the rest of political scene is as much failing in the process. No matter if they are closer to the communists dogmas, socialists, liberals or whatever there is. Every single formation I know is based on some ideology, that had failed in some way in the real world already. Maybe EPP is somehow trying to escape it, but it has its conservative and liberal factions with different ideas winning the battle.

What is ironic, and I know it, such rational party will not gain a major voters base in the near future. To win the elections and keep the stand they'd require people en masse to start thinking independently, beeing ready to scrap the ideas they've been fed up with during their lifes. Unlikely.

If your exchange programme can arrange accomodation, use it. 

But finding a room for a semester isn't that hard either. 


&gt; How are the facilities on campus? Is public transport from the university to the city difficult?

There are two campuses, both are directly in Berlin: 

http://goo.gl/maps/rcbu9

http://goo.gl/maps/uZ05U

You usually get a ticket for the local public transport with your semester fees, so you can use the Bus, Tram and S-Bahn in Berlin. 

A Bike is not necessary, but you can usually get a cheap one for som Euros from a fellow student. Just look at the Bulletin Boards :-)

Compared to other German larger towns, it's the cheapest. There are some expensive parts of the town, but you can live there pretty comfortable as a student.

I am fairly certain the UK benefits much more. The UK gets younger and harder workers. Bulgaria gets mostly retirees. 

18,000 seems like a lot, but since they are not all in the same village, they can't really contribute something, like say British public governance. They can't be copy for Bulgarians and teach them better governance. 

No. With only a  Brit or two here and there they are just interesting neighbors. Not even enough to slow down the disappearance of Bulgarian small towns and villages, which thanks to our ever shrinking population are melting away all over Bulgaria.

First, Stuttgart is an ideal area for you to live in as an American expat. You have IBM, HP and a lot of others here, other US military as well, so you can build a social network quickly. Also, the area is incredibly safe. My former boss (US expat) liked it so much that he tried to settle down here after retirement, it was just that his wife couldn't bear to live out of the US anymore. Otherwise, he would have been a happy man here.

Second, nurses are highly sought after in Germany, and moreso in the Stuttgart area. There are a lot of nurses from third-world countries in Germany who seem to have no problems working here, I would expect an American nurse to get red-carpet treatment.

Renting or buying shouldn't be an issue at all, one of our neighbours was also an expat from a US company until they moved away after they bought a new home. The landlord of a house we were interested in told us that there is even a property market catering to US expats specifically.

To get a feel for the city of Stuttgart, you can look [here](http://www.stuttgart-tourist.de/en). Keep your eyes open for opportunities in surrounding villages, though.

What they have in common is enough to draw the comparison. You're saying that a region has to be demonstrably in a horrific situation before it can declare independence.

I happen to disagree. If declaring independence can avoid the potential for horrific scenarios, like genocide, in a preemptive manner, than it's legitimate. And not even the danger of genocide is needed. If a region is the buffer zone in a conflict between two nations, one of which doesn't even have a democratically elected government, the multifaceted danger that poses to the region (danger against the region's people, economy, etc.) is enough for it to claim independence so that it can then decide for its future in that geopolitical situation.

What a joke.

Look, the point was that the situations were radically different, as I've discussed elsewhere in this thread. The difference is that with Kosovo the foreign army there was a UN sanctioned NATO-led multinational force that was legal in all respects of international law, and which had open and transparent referendum in '08. In Crimea, it's thousands of soldiers without military insignia and who are, politically and legally speaking, accountable to no one as they have no legal authority to be in Crimea (in fact, their very presence is illegal), who are occupying the region and where the sessions of the Crimean Rada are not transparent in any way, shape, or form.

That is why the situations are so markedly different, and why I don't support a secession vote in the Crimean rada. There are certainly many other ways a country could secede (for example, I support the right of Scotland, Catalonia, the Basque country, etc to secede if they choose to, and there has certainly been no genocide there). But the point is that the Kosovo-Crimea situations are radically different and should not be compared to make the argument that Crimea should be able to secede.",0,1394614816,null,0,false,0,cg0kqzw,t3_204ozh,t1_cg0kqzw,t1_cg0kp2x,null,1432765293,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Which basically excludes any place where we could make good use of them, i.e. near industry and population concentrations.

&gt;Even though there are dangers, I think ultimately the response to nuclear power is a knee-jerk response by our primitively-wired psyche and does not come from reason.

I think the love of a big powerful force like nuclear plants (that promises to solve all of our problems at once) comes from the same primitive brain, together with the tendency to bet the farm on the off-chance that nuclear indeed is the panacea its proponents want it to be. I guess our species has passed through and evolutionary bottleneck where taking a huge risk paid off once, and now we're stuck with that mentality - a mentality that served hunter-gatherer troupes well, perhaps, but that really isn't adaptive anymore when the effects of a botched gamble affect the whole species.

Seatbelts don't require decades to build and don't require additional research to iron out some essential hurdles in implementation.

&gt;Just like every company working on a product which does not yet exist to solve a problem which does exist is acting irrationally?

They are irrational if they expect people to drop everything else and wait patiently until their research is finished as if they can't fail. Just like it's irrational to believe that any of the cold fusion gurus are going to deliver on their promises. It would be nice if they succeeded, but until then I'm going to work with I have.

&gt;There are no fundamental problems with any of the designs. They are all problems of implementation

Any problem that prevents a reactor from being implemented is a fundamental problem for the energy supply. If the contractor for my bathroom offers me a stunningly designed, highly efficient and cheap bathroom but fails to deliver due to ""implementation problems"" I'm still going to let somebody else install my bathroom.

&gt;and with sufficient funding those problems would quickly disappear.

Nuclear energy has been subsidized up to the wazoo for decades, if only because of World War 2, the Cold War etc. All they produced were requests for even more grants. They've had plenty of time. Let's level the playing field and make renewables catch up in research funding.

&gt;The problem is that the self-proclaimed eco-fanatics are scaremongerers who love to yell about how dangerous and unsustainable nuclear energy is. They don't want a good solution, they don't want to save the environment, they want to be right and the problem with that is, that they have no problem with resorting to emotional appeals and other propaganda methods while pro-nuclear people usually try to use facts.

Not necessarily, mostly you have to worry about wind and river direction. Keep in mind that a modern reactor meltdown is contained very well in comparison to a nuclear bomb. Leakage is the primary concern, so building it downstream and downwind is important, but the distance can be reasonable, say 50 kilometers.

&gt;We got into our fossil fuel habit one shovelful of coal at a time, we'll get out of it one solar cell at a time.

I just think that kind of mindset is slowly killing our planet. Climate change changes the climate, so building climate dependent energy sources is really risky if you believe global warming is irreversible.

&gt;big powerful force like nuclear plants

It's not really that big or that powerful, you can build small reactors too. Nuclear power generators either have no influence on the environment or in the worst case scenario have a positive influence on the environment at the small risk of causing humans harm. 

Nuclear accidents happen less frequently than earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters with less devastating consequences. In the case of nuclear power, it may bother people that humans are responsible for the death of humans rather than it being nature, but on the other hand we are ready to go to war if someone does ""us"" harm.

And now people are so worried about radiation from the Fukushima plant, forgetting the real tragedy, the 270,000 displaced and the 19,000 dead in Japan. What about Haiti? 150,000 dead.

If people are willing to live in San Francisco knowing full well (historically and scientifically) the risks of a devastating earthquake, why can't we have the same mindset about nuclear power?

Das ist vermutlich auch der Grund, weshalb dich niemand anmacht. Das, und dass du es vermutlich ernst nimmst.

Ich gebe mal ein paar Beispiele aus meinem Bekanntenkreis.

1. Fall: Kollegen und ich entscheiden uns was leckeres in einem türkischen Restaurant zu essen, eine vegetarierin ist mit dabei, aber im Vorfeld schon abgecheckt, Restaurant hat umfangreiches Angebot an vegetarischem Essen. Vegetarierin nimmt Hühnchen, Begründung: Sie ginge ja nicht alle Tage türksich essen und wolle was leckeres.

Resultat: Ich nehme sie nicht ernst und wenn sie mir erzählt wie viel besser das Veterarier sein ist, mach ich Witze und wie gesagt, ernst nehmen kann ich sie dann nicht mehr.

2. Fall: Kommilitonin isst Maoam und Gummibärchen die mit Rinder/Schweinegelatine gemacht worden sind. Resultat: Siehe oben (wenn auch nciht ganz so extrem, zudem hat sie nie etwas von den Vorteilen des Vegetarier seins gepredigt)

3. Fall: Das ist jetzt die Härte! Abistufe, ich bin neu auf der Schule, erfahre das Mädel XY Vegetarierin ist, aus reiner Neugier frage ich nach den Gründen. Sie sagt: Das töten eines Tieres gliche dem töten eines Menschen, folglich würde man menschliches Fleisch essen, wenn man Tiere isst. Seh ich nicht so, aber ok, respektiere ich. 3 Wochen später kommt sie angerannt und lachend und strahlend zu ihrer BFF, mir ist die Kinnlade runtergefallen. Sie trug einen Hasenpelzmantel. HASENPELZ! Dann prahlte sie, wie lange sie dafür gespaart habe, dass der Pelz eigentlich das Innenfutter ist, sie es aber linksherum trägt damit das außen ist, bla bla bla. Ich sagte: Warum? Du bist doch Vegetarierin. Sie: Und? Ich: Das Verarbeiten von Tierfell zu Pelzmantels ist wie das Gerben von Menschenhaut zu Leder, folglich trägst du eine menschliche Lederjacke.

Oh, and we're not raping our allies. *lulz* It was our allies who helped us with PRISM if you don't remember you don't follow your own country's politics. **It's not rape when it's consensual.** ;) You might have a misunderstanding of the word. :)

 How's that united country and nuclear umbrella going for you? Hope you didn't mind us garrisoning the Fulda Gap for half-a-fucking century. :) Oh, and yeah dude, the future is totally with Russia, just compare Eastern Germany to Western Germany, or Poland/Estonia with Kazakhstan/Belarus. 

Seriously, you're building a fucking pipeline that completely circumvents Poland. You're giving Russia the opportunity to not only increase Europe's dependence on Russia's natural gas, but economically isolating your fucking EU and NATO ally. Now Russia can cut off gas to Ukraine and Poland without cutting it off to the rest of Europe *(yeah, you can redirect gas from Germany to Poland, but at a huge fucking cost of suddenly having to re-direct enough fuel to power an entire nation, and irking Russia at the same time, who Germany just fucking loves to appease)*. 

**Where was Germany in Libya and Mali? Where was Germany when Poland requested extra security? Where was Germany when Poland pleaded with them to cancel their pipeline with Russia which could economically isolate them and increase European dependence on Russian gas? Where was Germany with it's outrageous trade deficit and export policies which is draining the life out of it's neighbors?**

*Germany doesn't give a fuck about the long-term as much as you think it does, it only cares about the short-term and it's immediate needs, no matter who's dick it has to suck or crisis it has to ignore.*

It likes the status quo, so it tries to maintain the status quo by ignoring every fucking thing going on around it, which is a useless fucking strategy. 

**So who's really raping their neighbors?** 

There's a reason that the United States shares such a strong relationship with The Netherlands and The United Kingdom. There's a reason we have such strong security relationships with Poland and Sweden. There's a reason that the Franco-German Brigade fell the fuck apart and France shifted towards more defense cooperation with the United Kingdom and America instead. 

**We're not trying to abandon Eastern Europe, economically and militarily, to Russia like Germany.** We're not ignoring our allies in the European Union when it comes to interventions in Mali or Libya. We're there when they need us. We act when we're expected too. 

*Germany doesn't.* 

**Believe it or not, you might be the savior of the European Union, but you're also it's death nail.** Your failure to take up a leadership role, your failure to help militarily when your European allies need you, your failure to properly align yourself with and push the interests of your allies like Poland *(choosing Russia instead)* is what's going to kill the organization and keep the continent divided, not us.

Personalmente lo trovo ridicolo: da insegnante di informatica ai bambini, trovo molto più importante il *saper trattare* i bambini (che probabilmente deriva anche dalla voglia di insegnare e dalla passione per l'insegnamento) rispetto alla mera competenza. La competenza è importante a livelli avanzati, quando fai corsi di inglese avanzati dal liceo in su. Puoi essere anche madrelingua Dio in terra per quanto riguarda  l'inglese, ma se non sai trattare i bambini? Se non hai voglia di insegnare? Secondo me a livelli bassi (e diciamoci la verità, in Italia poche persone sono a livello talmente avanzato da meritarsi un madrelingua) bisognerebbe dare la possibilità a italiani di insegnare inglese **al pari degli stranieri** (nota bene: non dico di dare la precedenza agli italiani! Sto semplicemente invocando la meritocrazia e dicendo che secondo me è stupido dare la precedenza agli stranieri!)

A quanto ho capito da altri commenti, OP che dice che vorrebbe una certificazione di madrelingua è un'esasperazione del fatto che i madrelingua (anche non laureati) la scavalcano in graduatoria solo per la loro provenienza e non per il merito e OP rimane senza lavoro.

tl;dr secondo me bisognerebbe scegliere soltanto in base al *merito*, magari facendo un colloquio e testando nella pratica le capacità della persona, invece che in base alla *provenienza*.

It's comparable to natural gas if you take into account the whole lifecycle, so it's not that fantastic either. The more basic problem with that approach is that our known uranium reserves simply don't come anywhere near providing world energy use, providing that we manage to build that much reactors (required: 4 per week for decades. current lead time for the latest Finnish reactor: 18 years and counting).

&gt; Some have resorted to religion and others have resorted to ideology. 

OK, this is a proven fact.

&gt; We base our morals on humanism.

Which is an ideology. Unless you can show a rational proof that humanism is better than any possible moral framework or that it is at least better than any other existing framework, choosing humanism isn't rational.

Thus it is shown that either the EURP supports UBI for irrational reasons OR they haven't linked the rational reasons which is just as bad.


For question #1:

Prove that UBI on a multinational or even on a national level would have more positive consequences than the alternatives, for example leaving the money at the taxpayers, spending it on education or supporting small businesses.

My reasoning for why UBI is *not* the best alternative: **where does the money come from?**

But really, it's rather impressive you get internet access all the way up there in the Bavarian Alps. How do you find the time to reddit between the goatfucking and yodeling? 

And it's really easy to own a Mercedes and boost your economy when your country abuses the low wages and living standards of the poorer EU members to artificially depreciate the value of your exports....thus upping your competitiveness by draining the competitiveness of the weaker and poorer EU members. :) 

But how strong is a foundation propped up by on Russian natural gas and constructed through picking at your neighbor's houses like a vulture? :) 

I mean shit, at least the [United States actually made serious economic reforms following the Great Recession](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_responses_to_the_subprime_crisis), all while Germany has failed to take a leadership role in the European Union *(which it benefits most from)* and motivate the other members to make serious, wide-sweeping emergency reforms that are concrete and authoritative. 

And you seem pretty confident about that German economy, but I don't see why.  [America came out of the recession four years ago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Great_Recession), the European Union did as well, but had [a double-dip recession](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/15/eurozone-double-dip-recession) shortly afterwards, [which it only exited from last August](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/13/eurozone-exit-double-dip-recession). In short, we *(America)* still have years of growth *(albeit small)* while Europe as a whole still has years of recession/loss looming over it's head. We've reached pre-2008 levels this year IIRC, but Europe still has a long way to go before it regains the ground it's lost.

Plus, America had a 2012 [GDP growth of 2.2%](https://www.google.com/search?q=u.s.+gdp+growht&amp;oq=u.s.+gdp+growht&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i65l2j69i60j69i61j69i60.9043j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8#es_sm=122&amp;espv=210&amp;q=united+states+gdp+growth&amp;safe=off), compared to the European Union's projected 2013 [GDP growth of .2%](http://rt.com/business/eu-gdp-q3-eurostat-707/) (remember, the E.U. was in recession in 2012). And since our growth has remained relatively stable, **our economy is growing at something like 12x that of Europe.** And our 2013 growth numbers are supposed to be even higher, so expect that multiple to rise. If IIRC, we're even projected to surpass the European Union's economy by 2020.

Unemployment wise, the European Union has a [unemployment rate of 10.9%](https://www.google.com/search?q=European+Union+unemployment+rate&amp;oq=European+Union+unemployment+rate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.5239j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8) and the Eurozone an unemployment rate of [12.1%, which is projected to go up to 12.3 percent](http://www.dw.de/oecd-predicts-record-eurozone-unemployment-for-2014/a-16953636)  by the end of the year. The United States has [a unemployment rate of 7.3%](https://www.google.com/search?q=United+States+Unemployment+rate&amp;oq=United+States+Unemployment+rate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.5218j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8), which  is projected to [fall below 7%](http://www.dw.de/oecd-predicts-record-eurozone-unemployment-for-2014/a-16953636)  by the end of the year. 

And to top it off, unlike Germany and Europe with Russia, we're [no longer dependent on foreign energy like we used to be, and we won't be for the foreseeable future](http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/blog/earth_to_power/2013/04/us-natural-gas-reserves-hit-record.html?page=all), so we got that going for us too. :)

The application for the caesarean was made in the Court of Protection by the Mid-Essex NHS Trust on 23 August 2012, not Essex social services as originally stated; a care order was sought and obtained by Essex County Council as soon as the child was born the following day, 24 August 2012. The precise position relating to the court applications was not clear at time of our publication because a key judgment relating to them, made 15 months earlier, had never been made public; following our reports, this and further judgments were eventually released on 4 December 2013.

Do you seriously think European militaries started dropping cement training bombs on Libyan military targets in some elaborate ploy to get the United States to help when they really didn't need help? 

&gt;Your argument is that the EU is incapable of an action like Libya without US involvement, in reality of course it's able but why would you when US support is so readily available?

**OF COURSE IT DOESN'T IN THE LONG-TERM**. 

It's the most developed and militarily advanced region on the god damn globe. My point was it can't do it with it's present standing military without taking timely emergency measures. You can't be in the middle of a operation like Libya.....and than just be like *""Oh, fuck, hold up Gaddafi, give us a couple weeks/months so we can properly rev-up our military-industrial complex, logistics and intelligence gathering abilities. Kay? Thanks bud.""*

You shouldn't have to take those types of measures when all that is being undertaken is REGIONAL bombing runs with no prospect of occupation. It takes fucking years to build up power projection capabilities, **so get on it**. A lot of men and a lot of weapons doesn't mean shit when you can't use them when you need them, when you can't put them where you want them. We both know war with Russia is slim, but interventions like Mali and Libya are to be expected, so the military should be prepared. You know....isn't that a pretty fundamental part of any peacetime military strategy? Military preparedness for the most likely scenarios? 

&gt;What do you know about being in the military? You're almost certainly some fat, student reddit neckbeard who thinks he understands military matters because he reads some dumb Yank's clickbait on FP, the whole reason I get angry with you is because you clearly don't understand the basics and have zero willingness to learn - instead you dismiss those with more experience than you because you can't afford to have your warped worldview altered.

&gt;My only hope is that you grow out of it.

And what the fuck do you know about me? I do know enough to respect somebody's position, without devolving into personal attacks on them. I guess respect and a balanced conversation isn't something they taught you in boot camp, is it? 

Don't sit here and fucking get on my dick with your psychoanalysis bullshit. I'm not in high school, alright dude, I don't got time for this bitchy catfighting where we trade mean girl barbs and put words in each other's mouth like we got our panties in a bunch.

Sampling method
The sampling was based on a two-stage clustered
stratified design with equal probability of selection for
households within clusters. As the first stage, primary
sampling units (PSUs) were selected for this survey
with probability proportional to size (PPS). Wherever
possible, local electoral territorial units were used as
PSUs, as they have the benefit of having limited and
well-defined geographic boundaries and there is usu
-
ally up-to-date information available concerning the
people living there. Census enumeration districts or
local authorities were used as PSUs where local elec
-
toral territorial units were not available. In each PSU, a
set number of addresses was selected with a view to
conducting a maximum of 30 interviews within the PSU.
To ensure maximum representativeness of the
selected PSUs, the samples were implicitly stratified
by geographical region and by urban/rural character.
All PSUs available in each country were compiled in one
list, representing the total population of the country.
They were then listed within each region by level of
urban-ness, and then in alphabetical order. The PSUs
were then selected with probability proportional to size.
PSU size was measured by the number of households
or, if that information was not available, by the num
-
ber of residents 18 years old and older, the number of
citizens 18 years old or older, or the total population
size within the PSU.
Typically, 50 PSUs and 50 reserve PSUs were selected in
each country, with the aim of conducting 30 interviews
in each PSU. In most countries, the reserve PSUs were
used only after the addresses in the main PSUs had
been exhausted

1. Wozu macht sich Putin eigentlich die Mühe, Russia Today zu betreiben und
2. Hat er sich schon beim deutschen Beitragszahler und öffentlich-rechtlichen Fernsehen für die kostenlose PR bedankt?

In jeder Talkrunde, die ich bisher zum Thema Krim gesehen habe, sitzt ein Kremlbot und erklärt mir Putins Sicht auf die Welt, ob das jetzt der russische Botschafter oder eine von der russischen Regierung bezahlte Journalistin ist. Und dann kommt auch noch das Kabarett daher und sagt mir, dass wir in der Ukraine politische Rückendeckung dafür leisten, dass die USA aus dem Land die nächste IMF-Kolonie machen. Nicht, dass das falsch wäre, aber: Das sind die selben USA, die uns ohne Rücksicht auf Verluste ausspionieren und der selbe IMF, der zusammen mit europäischer Kommission und Zentralbank die drei Reiter der wirtschaftlichen Apokalypse in Irland und dem Mittelmeerraum gegeben hat. Natürlich ist es scheiße, dass wir den Menschen in der Ukraine die 'Wahl' zwischen Pest (Ausbeutung durch uns) und Cholera (Ausbeutung durch Russland) geben, aber wir sind hier Täter und Opfer, Geiseln mit Stockholm-Syndrom, die unserem Lehnsherren in Washington den nächsten Vassal vor die Füße zerren. Ist ja auch per se nicht schlimm das so darzustellen, ich find Balance in Nachricht und Meinung schließlich gut, aber macht sich das russische Staatsfernsehen die Mühe, die westliche Position darzustellen, zu verstehen und sogar gutzuheißen? Nicht, dass ich wüsste. Und diese Bemühungen werden auch niemanden umstimmen, der glaubt, die Medien in Deutschland wären gleichgeschaltet, im In- oder Aus-land. Nochmal, ich finds gut, aber es sieht mir aus wie vergebliche Liebesmüh.

Bonus:
&gt;Na gut, das wirkt dann streckenweise etwas belehrend* und bedient den linksparteisympathisierenden Sozialdemokraten im TV-Zuschauer mit möglicherweise etwas zu mundgerecht zubereiteter Meinung.

true,barsoap,SCHL,Sleswig-Holsteen,"Buying such stuff before you can cook is a sure way to never learn to cook. You need, in order of importance:

* Chef Knife **and sharpener**, cutting board (voila, there's your sandwiches). And I'm saying *Chef* knife because the shape is important. Learn to use it, it's 90% of your cooking life. If in doubt, first keep your fingers away from the sharp side, then google. Always keep your knife sharp. If you can't shave at least the one or other hair off your arm with it, it's not sharp. The proper way to do that is three grindstones, but that's overkill for your purposes and hard to master. Get a proper ceramic rotary one, the one from [fiskars](http://www.fiskars.eu/var/fiskars_emea/storage/images/frontpage2/gardening-yard-care/products/tool-care-and-spare-parts/tool-care/120740-fiskars-xsharp-axe-and-knife-sharpener/1699747-50-eng-EU/120740-Xsharp-Axe-and-Knife-Sharpener.jpg) is good and cheap. Cutting board should be wood, for home uses. Bamboo is very nice, and usually even dishwater safe. Keep that bugger dry, store upright.
* Pan, [big and deep](http://i.tischwelt.de/media/produkte/i/b/df/pfanne-hoch-antihaftbeschichtet-28-0-cm-novara-87693045_id160775.jpg). (yes, you can cook rice in it. add some meat and veggies and you have a dish. [Or you could do something proper](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z_d0soK1cI)). Spatula. You can also do steaks and pancakes in there, but if you do it often you might want to get a less deep one, as spatula action isn't optimal. You're going to survive it, though.
* Pestle and mortar (and tons of unground spices and freeze-dried herbs. You'll thank me later). Granite, ten bucks or so. It's porous, so keep soap away from it, clean dry or with hot water. Because of that, also keep animal products away from it, but who grinds up meat, anyway.
* Pot, with steam thingie ([like this](http://i01.i.aliimg.com/photo/v6/380343113/3pcs_Steam_Pot.jpg). Enjoy your proper pasta, the rest of what you've got is already perfectly adequate for sauces. Both tomato (pan), cream (pan) and pesto (mortar).
* *Possibly* second knife, short, to peel potatoes, cut off veggie ends, etc. Not strictly necessary, but nice and cheap.
* A vegetable/cheese grinder. [One of these](http://picture.yatego.com/images/4cfddf6403e911.2/grater2-kqh/kchenhelfer-gemsereibe-gemsehobel.jpg), forget about other types, they suck. Note the hand guard / food holder and small grating plates, which means they're easy to clean. You can of course cut everything, too, but if you want to make potato pancakes or such you gonna hate it. Or just grind up some carrots, add some juice, and enjoy, for a quick snack.

Oh, and some dishes and assorted cutlery. But you'll notice if you don't have them.

true,onehasnofrets,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt;So it's an ethnic technology that somehow works in European countries but not elsewhere (even assuming Sellafield is not Europe)? :)

The original argument concerned Japan's regulatory and training environment. Given that most nuclear accidents are caused by human error, that's not as unreasonable as you might think. Specifically the Japanese concept of ""Saving face"" might have played a role in Daiichi's manager's unwillingness to admit that their plant was at danger. But that's cultural, not ethnical. Don't put words in my mouth.

&gt;Because averages don't matter when the risk is to turn an area with a radius of dozens of kilometers uninhabitable for an undetermined amount of years.

When you want to talk about the relative 'safety', you have to use the same definitions everywhere. I'm doing all the work here comparing qualities across different modes, you just say ""it has another quality, therefore no nuclear"". You can't just wave away quantitative analysis. That's the meaning of the word rationality. ""What is the ratio between x and y"". So if you insist on saying averages don't matter, I'm afraid I have to call you irrational.

So evacuation then. Have you seen the video of the wolves of Chernobil? They're doing great. They don't care about radiation. The reason we evacuate is because people are afraid of radiation. What radius is safe is based on the Linear No threshold principle, which holds that there is no safe radiation. In that model, every Becquerel is assumed to increase the risk of cancer. You'll find that in most of the evacuation zone, the risk of cancer in comparable to smoking, or pollution, or staying out in the sun. Oh yeah, UV rays are radiation too, and they stimulate the body's vitamin D. So small amounts are actually healthy, but that makes the math hard. So how large an evacuation zone need to be is not uncontroversial.

Evacuations happen with chemical accidents. Do we shut down the electronics industry? Also, you have to weigh the people that might have a remote possibility of having to leave their homes against all the people who can life a modern civilized life with the electricity from nuclear. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. 

&gt;Car crashes don't make that piece of road impassable for decades.

Maybe I wasn't clear, but coal ect. are the cars in this scenario, and airplanes the nuclear.

&gt;You just insist to hide the extremeness of accidents behind the average so you can ignore the qualitatively different effects.

The qualitatively different effects are the risk of cancer. There is no real agreement about how many extra cases of cancer any meltdown will cause. Estimates range from 0 to 10000, because it's epidemically so hard to seperate this specific cause from all other causes of cancer. So we're dealing with an unknown here.
Pollution increases the risk of cancer every day. So does smoking and sitting out in the sun. We don't ban those, we use protection and we warn people so they can be responsible. But we know the risk of those. So given what I do know, the body count from those extremely rare accidents has to be proven to me to be in the millions, before I consider coal safer.

&gt;It's comparable to natural gas if you take into account the whole lifecycle, so it's not that fantastic either. The more basic problem with that approach is that our known uranium reserves simply don't come anywhere near providing world energy use, providing that we manage to build that much reactors (required: 4 per week for decades. current lead time for the latest Finnish reactor: 18 years and counting).


Now we're getting to the interesting stuff. I didn't say uranium, I said fissile material. U-235 is 0,72% of all the Uranium. Conventional nuclear reactors have less than a percent of efficiency. Again, nuclear is in a league of it's own in this realm, we simply wouldn't accept this from any other technology. We'd probably say that they'd need to go work on it again. And they do, like at [Superphénix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superph%C3%A9nix) That's a breeder reactor, runs on the 99% of uranium. It's more efficient, and can use up existing nuclear waste. So now there's 10000 more fuel! Great, right? Well, there was a large NIMBY-movement, it got shot at by ecoterrorists, and shut down to gather votes with the Green movement. That's actually been the typical series of events when nuclear tries to innovate for about 50 years now. They don't care what problems a given reactor solves, they don't care whether the chance of an accident is like winning the lottery or like winning 100 lotteries in a row. They oppose nuclear altogether, just because it's nuclear.

There's plenty reactor architectures that solve the problem you mention. There's architectures that solve the waste problem. There's architectures completely without release of radiation. There's architectures that produce isotopes which are used in cancer therapies. But the decision whether to scale them up or shut them down is made by politicians faced with rabid crowds.

&gt;The most abundant energy source we have is the sun.

The sun is a nuclear fusion reactor that solves the containment problem by not being contained, but by being 150 million kilometers away from earth. So technically , solar is a nuclear technology. Geothermal runs on the heat that the earth's core generates by fission, so technically geothermal is nuclear energy. I'm all for solar energy, wind energy, biogas, all the renewables. We need to stop the fossil fuels, and stop fighting among ourselves. Say in some county, that's 90% of the market. Then obviously, everything else they do has to increase 10-fold. Ten times more wind, ten times more solar, ten times more biogas, ect.

true,CurtHoliday352,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;The funny thing is that I generally agree with you in terms of EU nations meeting their NATO obligations, even though I stop before your desire for a unified EU military or a more ""active"" force, it's kind of absurd that this long after the Cold War we still let NATO members shirk their responsibility and I'd like to see that change.

&gt;My problem with your position is that you use examples as proof of your argument that are wholly inappropriate, like how you say that Libya is proof that the EU needs the US to do anything which is patently not the case. You can argue your position without trying to bend the facts to meet it; saying that every time the US joins in on an operation shows that EU forces are incapable of acting independently is like saying that the US was incapable of handling Iraq or Afghanistan on its own and required help from other nations to invade - it just doesn't join up.

But they are *incapable* of acting without U.S. support, at least for countries like Libya. Sierre Leone, the Ivory Coast, Mali and CAR are all examples of where U.S. support isn't needed, but when it comes to semi-advanced states with Libya with half-competent AA defense and a standing military, than U.S. help is *absolutely needed*. 

Iraq and Libya are nothing alike. It's not even comparable to Mali, because Mali wasn't motivated out of a plea of solidarity for international justification of the intervention like Iraq was, it was about capability. 

Yes, France could've more than handled Mali itself, especially with the United Kingdom helping, but it didn't ask for U.S. help out of solidarity, it asked because of capability. America didn't ask for help with Iraq and Afghanistan because of capability, they asked because of solidarity. The *primary* motivations behind each different. 

&gt;The EU is already more than capable of taking on Russia in a conventional war, just because our spending and power is skewed towards certain member states doesn't mean we're woefully unprepared for a conflict should they force our hand.

&gt;It seems like a pretty moot point though considering the US would never stay out of a conflict like that even if they peeled back their European activity.

Of course it can, because that's a total war scenario. It's not one which relies on power projection and quick, decisive strikes. It allows European countries to fully mobilize their educated populations and technologically-advanced military-industrial complexes. 

Preparedness *(at least in comparison to the type of preparation needed for interventions like Libya)* is secondary when you have the time to align your entire country against it. 

But let's for example, say that Estonia is invaded, or that in the slimmest fucking chance, EU member-states decide to intervene Crimea. American support is cut-off or unavailable for whatever reason *(remember, it's a hypothetical scenario)*. At this point, power projection is absolutely critical, because for all intents and purposes, I really don't, *in my opinion*, think that either the European Union or Russia want to escalate into a nuclear confrontation, or start mobilizing in a *""Total War""* scenario, because then the chances of nuclear holocaust are all be inevitable *(and why it probably will never happen)*. 

So in my opinion, in such a scenario, both Russia and member-states of the European Union would want to keep it as limited and short as possible, as both know they're playing with irradiated fire. It's the same doctrine the Chinese Military is applying to contested territory in the South China Sea when faced with the threat of American reprisal *(as per our MDP with countries in the region)*. 

So, even when talking about Russia instead of Libya, the need for power projection and increased military funding/preparedness is still absolutely critical. 

Of course....this is the same logic the Confederacy used in the American Civil War and the German Empire used in WWI....both of which inevitably ended up as *""Total War""* scenarios...but fuck....I think the point still stands; and who knows what would've happened if Lee captured Washington or Moltke the Younger captured Paris *(without Churchill as Prime Minister to buoy the Home Front)* in the very first phases of each war?

Correction. They are not a distinct ethnic minority. They overwhelmingly identify as Hungarian, but they do have a strong regional identity (think something like the Bavarians - ethnic Germans with a strong regional identity). Only about half of Transylvanian Hungarians are Szekler though.

&gt;In 2002 the estimated ethnic composition of Szekler Land consisted of Hungarians (61 percent), Romanians (33 percent), Germans (3 percent) and Roma (3 percent).

1. Why on earth are they using the 2002 census figures? The 2011 numbers have been available for over a year.

2. I assume they took the combined numbers of Mureş, Harghita and Covasna counties and came up with the above ethnic figures ([see map 1](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Szekely04.png)). Thing is that only the central and eastern parts of Mureş were part of Szeklerland ([map 2](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/T%C3%B6rt_Sz%C3%A9kelyf%C3%B6ld.png/1024px-T%C3%B6rt_Sz%C3%A9kelyf%C3%B6ld.png)), and afaik the Szeklers don't really want the other parts of Mureş county to be part of the autonomy ([map 3](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Szekely_Land_issues.svg/1100px-Szekely_Land_issues.svg.png)).

true,CurtHoliday352,UNSA,United States of America,"Exactly, the Soviet madman was never true, and winter in Russia is no longer the fear. Nuclear weapons have completely changed the game, and Russia can no longer keep retreating until the enemy trips over it's own feet. 

Nuclear weapons have brought Russia onto the same level as everyone else, and made Total War just as costly for them as everybody else. It wasn't like this in WWI and WWII. 

Quick, decisive and limited wars are the future. I don't think we're on the precipice of darkness, but I'm not foolish enough to think that we're in a peaceful utopia either. And I'm not saying each EU member-state should maintain massive, conscripted armies with huge stockpiles of equipment or massive military-industrial complexes, but I do believe that they severely need to increase their power projection capabilities, so they can actually utilize those militaries they have, which are some of the most professionally-trained and technologically advanced forces in the world, against countries like Libya or in scenarios I mentioned above without having to enact emergency measures, or having to rely on the U.S. for logistical and intelligence capabilities to carry out in the operation in a timely manner.

All that is required is a small, tailored, well-trained and well-equipped force which possesses power projection. European militaries *(well most of them)* have all of that....except for the power projection....which even France and the United Kingdom need to focus more on as Libya has shown. 

And I believe China is the best country to back up my example. They have a huge population, a large amount of territory and the world's largest reserves of Rare Earth Materials, with overland borders with some of the most natural resource-gifted nations in the world *(I.E. Russia and Central Asia)*. 

But despite that, EVEN THEIR military leadership has began implementing a doctrine of *""Short, limited &amp; decisive""* wars in potential scenarios against nations they have territorial disputes with in the South China Sea, many of whom, like NATO, have mutual defense pacts with the United States. 

**EDIT:** And Estonia was a wrong example, I should've just stuck to Ukraine for such a hypothetical scenario, so if you don't mind I'd ask you imagine that instead, a place of contention that is nether Russian soil nor EU/NATO soil.

Former nuclear power gives up nukes on condition of integrity of national border supported by the key global powers. One of those parties decides to annexe and everyone suddenly gets interested in what colour the ceiling is. 

Why the hell would any nuclear nation agree to anything similar in the future? I'd be mildly surprised if this doesnt lead to another arms race of sorts. 

The West is (rightfully) fearful of war with Russia, who the hell wants to ruin almost 70 years of relative peace with a country armed with nukes and a president batshit insane enough that he might just use them?

On the centenary of the First World War which some say started with the assassination of an Archduke (or as Blackadder put it ""a family argument that everyone else got involved in) it seems somewhat ironic that the end result of this could be war.

The alternatives are more interesting though:

 * Russia gets Crimea and the West looks like a bunch of idiots . Maybe Russia will throw some gas to what is left of Ukraine as a sweetener so no one pushes the case

 * Russia leaves the Crimea and gets guarantees about its navy base.

true,Moist_Manwich,null,null,"So Hamburg is actually a city I've got some knowledge of here.  Yeah, housing is relatively difficult to find, but depending on what you're looking for it might not be so bad.  You already know the major resources (though I'd add immobilienscout24.de to that list), so that helps.  And English should not be a problem AT ALL.  Hamburg is a pretty large and affluent city, and most people I've come across have at least a basic handle of English.  

As for the place itself, there are a few things I'd advise knowing.  First, if you're looking for a flatshare with another person, you'll probably have the easiest time finding a place.  The tough part is finding a flat share with someone you'll get along with, which is why I'd advise trying to speak with the person on Skype first, if possible.  Again, English isn't likely to be an issue, though definitely make it clear you know some German and are eager to use it when you can.  Also, flatshares likely won't involve one of the worst parts about finding German flats, the courtage.  The courtage is basically a non-refundable 'fee' that you pay to the 'agent' that lists the flat.  This fee is usually a bit more than twice the monthly rent.  I'm not really sure why people here still put up with this system, considering these websites take care of most of the work related to posting/advertising places, but Germans can be very good at rationalizing stupid things (see the GEZ or TV/Radio fees).

If you're looking for a place for yourself, that will be harder without actually being here.  I really do advise getting a one month flat share first, then look for a place of your own (assuming that's what you want to do).  Though if I'm reading right, this might just be a summer thing?  In which case I wouldn't worry too much about it.  Just try to get a read on the person, and hope for the best.  If you DO want your own place...maybe try a couple week stay in an Airbnb listing when you get here, and devote all your first few days to finding a flat?  It REALLY helps if you can see the place and talk to the people (just like anywhere, really).

You also want to worry about location a bit.  As always, the closer to the middle of the city, the more expensive things will be.  Maybe expect to pay from the low 300s up to 700 or 800 a month if you live in a good district.  General districts I would avoid are Wilhelmsburg, Veddel, Harburg, Blankenese, and Rissen (either not nice or way too far out of the way, although where's your internship at?  If it's Airbus in Finkenwerder for example, maybe Blankenese would be a good thing).  

Sternschanze, Altona-Ottensen, St. Pauli, Eimsbuttel, Rotherbaum (if money allows) and Barmbek are what I'd recommend, kind of in that order.  St. Pauli is a pretty interesting place (sort of alternative, punkish culture there, plus crazy nightlife), and Sternschanze has some really good stuff to do there, and is probably the best 'all-around' district, though maybe a bit loud and busy if that isn't your thing.  Altona is more...preppy, like where a bunch of young parents would live, but it's still in a good location and generally nice.  Also very close to the Altona station, which is handy.  Actually, generally, check and try to get a place within walking distance of either an S or U Bahn station.  The buses here are nice enough, but not nearly as convenient to use.

Be excited for this!  Hamburg is actually a pretty cool city, and if the weather is nice this Summer it'll be a great place to live.  The parks here are awesome, the nightlife is pretty good, and there's pretty much always SOMETHING going on.  Just be ready for the northern German 'coldness'.  People here aren't rude, but they can be very gruff and severe.  It's just their way.  Oh, and if timing works out, register for a Volkshochschule Deutsch course.  Maybe your internship already will have some language course worked out, but if not do this.  It's not very expensive, there are classes all over the city, and the hours can work with pretty much any schedule.  Let me know if you have any more questions, I'll be happy to answer them if I can!

And I sure hope you like pilsner.  Because goddam they sure love it here...

1. How? UBI would cause a *huge* increase in state expenses, requiring a proportionally huge increase in taxes. Which would then be built into the price of products and services, like every other tax.
2. Why? If outsourcing a job is worth it, a company will do it. This will make outsourcing more jobs worthwhile because of the tax hike.
3. WTF? How would UBI cause more jobs?
4. Who will want extra income so badly?
5. How so? More tax -&gt; more inflation -&gt; higher UBI -&gt; more tax...
6. Why is unconditional better than conditional?
7. How is it false dilemma? This is simply examining the alternatives and choosing the better ones.

Usually, though, we would just have simply parties with beer, punch, music, and a bunch of people - no theme. There were six fraternities on campus and six team houses (hockey, football, etc.) and each house would throw two parties per week. So there was a lot to choose from.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"I don't think this is a good idea. The populations of those nations are too low to contribute meaningfully in any way. How do we guarantee that they will contribute and not simply have a parasitic relationship like the majority of NATO members? Is it a good idea to be adding countries to an alliance when most members of that alliance are already freeloading? Is it a good idea to add countries (such as Finland) that border Russia, and simultaneously contribute relatively little?

I know its harsh but potential member countries should be admitted based on a cost/benefit or asset/liability basis. For instance, Baltic nations should never have been admitted. Not only do they lie on the border of Russia, meaning there is no way to guarantee their defense, they are also incapable of providing anything meaningful towards the alliance. These are straight up liabilities. All border states of Russia should be mutually agreed upon buffer states. Sorry, but between Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, there are less than 13 million people in those countries combined. That's under half the population of California. How are we supposed to protect those countries? Is it worth risking a war over such a small population? Is it worth worsening our relationship with Russia over a handful small border states?

If NATO is to be taken seriously, it needs to stop adding liability nations. Norway and Sweden are less liabilities than the aforementioned border states, but who is to say they will be considered assets? There are already a number of wealthy European nations who contribute little, and expect everything. How do we know these countries will be any different?

Edit: I don't usually do this, but can someone explain why I am being down voted? I am merely suggesting that NATO takes a more careful look at who it lets in, and I am using historical precedence to back up my opinion.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; I live in the UK and what I don't understand is how EVERYTHING can be so much expensive. Not only the house market. Every month, I spend 1.5 times more on groceries than I did in France. The fact that the UK is an island seems a bit shaky to explain such a discrepancy, and it's not like the wages were 1.5 times higher.

I agree that the UK (and in particular the greater London area) seems to operate in a different economy from the rest of the single market. Part of this is because London doesn't really feel like other European cities, it is also in a very real sense a global city (in the way that it is a hub for global finance, experiences high levels of immigration from the entire globe, property in London is seen as a safe investment by the entire globe and not just Europeans, and also London-life has a ""prestige factor"", and most of the world is able to find work relatively quickly in London as most people already have some basic English).

The fact that things are so expensive in London (and also elsewhere in the UK), does not really seem to be a deterrent for people. Everyone knows that the Uk is overpriced, and yet people still chose to cross Europe to live there. So I don't really see any solutions to the question of high-price-UK.

For a Brit, even if you own a small London property, you know you can sell up and buy anywhere in e.g. Spain or Bulgaria and live in relative luxury. But the majority of Brits moving to Spain or Bulgaria don't really have the right skills to work in those places, the only rational reason to move there is for a life-style reason. So it tends to be retired people who move to those places permanently or choose to buy a second home there, or alternatively students who want to take advantage of cheap prices, while relatively few British workers move to Continental Europe for professional reasons.

During the last decade I spent quite a bit of time working in Italy and considered buying property there. But in the end I decided to move back to the UK, because I thought that I would get ""trapped"" with an Italian salary and the value of Italian property and end up falling behind my equivalent London salary and London property price and never be able to get back to the UK. Differently, I think that I can probably spend the next decade living and working in London and then move back to Italy if I end up wanting to. 

It doesn't look like it is going to be possible to live in Italy and work in the UK unfortunately. There is no way to make London culture/weather/food more mediterranean. And there is no way to make Italian working practices more anglo-saxon.  ",0,1394631717,null,0,false,0,cg0o2r6,t3_2076kx,t1_cg0o2r6,t1_cg0nnin,null,1432766862,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

I don't think that at least Finland will be joining NATO any time soon as the long term goal inside the political class has evolved more around common European defense.

Even if they've taken some pretty large steps in scaling back a lot of those measures since the end of the Cold War, the doctrine and basics are still there, making them much more prepared and capable of defending their country than other European nations. 

Hitler hated Switzerland, he called it a *""Pimple on the face of Europe""* and beyond a doubt, he could've crushed Switzerland if he truly wanted too, but he didn't, because it would've been too costly. The Balkans and Greece set back Operation Barbarossa by a season, Switzerland would've set it back by a year.  

So unless Switzerland itself is the primary target to subject and occupy *(even though it's a neutral country, which, for all intents and purposes, won't attack your rear lines and will even trade with you, as the Swiss-Nazi controversies attest to this day)*, that military preparedness and ability is a **huge** deterrent.

true,iama_george_amaa,LATV,European,"Here's something that was posted today on Facebook by some guy I know, I think it provides enough background details on the history and on the general mood on these annual clashes between Latvian nationalists and Russian antifascists. I'm not the author, I simply translated it, and if you read it, read the whole of it not just the first paragraph.

&gt; With regard to the demonstration of March 16 - if we go there, we really shouldn't be afraid of anything even though anything may happen. Some Molotov cocktails thrown by provocateurs, a few burnt cars, generally nothing extreme, the head of State Police [Ints] Ķuzis has said it on TV and he also says that the situation is being controlled, whatever it means. Meanwhile, in the EU and US news we hear already that Russia has already tried to repeat the Kiev scenario in Latvia and destabilize the situation, and that they have begun to draw their forces close to the Russian border with Latvia, Estonia, and Poland. At the same time, news reports in Russia claim ""we told you already, EU equals fascists if they allow such demonstrations"". In the worst case scenario with such a small incident the Ukrainian war escalates up to a real conflict between EU and Russia. But we were not afraid. And we won't take responsibility. The memory of SS legionnaires is sacred, and it will be kept as such. And to everyone interested it will be correctly explained. Am I right? But maybe we should still get out of the framework of commemorating our grandfathers and have a look at ourselves within a somewhat wider context? Maybe we should ask our grandfathers as a thought experiment what would they like us to do to commemorate them? Would they like to see us commemorating them by the Freedom Monument even if their grandchildren would have to cry for themselves [by their own graves]?

&gt; I think that by not joining such a demonstration any more we would have even less to be afraid of, and nothing would be lost. Except for the only thing that keeps the demonstrators from not going is the need to acknowledge that the fact of having served in the SS legion is nothing special that Latvians should be principally proud of. And to acknowledge that maybe they shouldn't have joined the demo on previous years either. Furthermore, they should remember that even though out of those drafted in Latvia into German legion approx. 50,000 died, additionally approx. 70,000 [Latvians] fell fighting while under the flag of USSR. Because they were drafted in 1940-1941. If we don't commemorate separately those others who possibly had a psychologically tougher job to fight than the legionnaires, then this demonstration is actually unfair because it highlights only the merit of those who served the German side. And now please explain it to someone why it is to be viewed just like that and why is it not to be interpreted as paying tribute to a small part of Hitler's army. You know, it is not easy to put into words even for me as a Latvian. And until our statesmen in such a demonstration don't carry slogans [such as] ""In 1940 and 1945 Latvia suffered unfair betrayal by Europe"", ""Nazi regime was criminal but we had to chose between service or death"", ""Stalin invaded Latvia in 1940 but Hitler did it only in 1941"", ""The USSR army bases could not protect us against Nazi invasion in 1941"", ""SS units never participated in holocaust"", until then each year we will have this problem of having to explain and the risk of provocation.

&gt; So far, unfortunately, it looks like until we have the first serious incident that would be the cause for a precedent in order to adopt a forbidding law, the demonstration itself will remain as a weird and sad tradition. However, as I said, in the current context of Ukraine when history is being written by hours, by joining this demonstration we risk not only our own lives but also those of Ukrainians, Russians and possibly the lives of soldiers of other nationalities. [The lives of] which are still intact and may be kept as such. But this is just my humble opinion. I know that escalating up to war is a too pessimistic scenario to be believable and I really hope that everything will be peaceful on Sunday. But I ask you to think at least, until the next time.

Then there would be no reason for them to even cooperate with NATO and just develop their own nuclear arms programs. Remember we want LESS nukes in the world, not more.

The main deterrent of NATO is the combined nuclear arsenal of its member states, as well as its collective conventional forces. NATO has the ability to escalate to the point where Russia is entirely annihilated, but so does Russia, it's called mutually assured destruction.

&gt;If NATO is to be taken seriously, it needs to stop adding liability nations.

Seriously by whom? The more NATO expands, the less military action Russia can take, because its nuclear umbrella expands to those countries as well.

&gt;It's a great lesson for Iran and others.

A unfortunate lesson. 

I completely get the principle behind it, and M.A.D. *(Mutually Assured Destruction)* has always reigned supreme in relations between nuclear powers....but the dynamics of the game change when more and more countries get nuclear weapons. MAD than becomes less of a guarantee of peace and more of a game of Russian Roulette *(lulz Russian)*. 

I mean....let's look at the countries in the region.....you have the Pakis, the Indians, the Jews, the Ruskies and the Chinese all with nuclear weapons......all pointing their loaded guns at each other in a small room, all with fingers on the trigger. Now you're going to throw the Persians in there? Who next? The Turks and Arabs are going to get all skitzy and shit, because now not only do the Jews and Russians have nuclear weapons, but now the Persians do too...so *of course* they're going to start their own nuclear programs out of self-preservation. 

Now in this scenario, you have the Turks, the Arabs, the Ruskies, the Chinese, the Pakis, the Indians, the Jews and the Persians all in a small room....and all with loaded guns pointed at each other. 

**And it only takes one bullet to fuck everyone.** 

Even if they arn't related to the dispute, what do you think the Arabs are going to do if they see nuclear weapons being launched out of Iran? Even if they're headed for Israel, the Saudis don't know that, so they launch against Iran, now India and Pakistan see a bunch of nuclear missiles coming from fucking everywhere, so they freak out and fire nuclear weapons, now China see's India launching nuclear weapons and freak out, so they launch nuclear weapons, Russia detects this, so they launch their own nuclear weapons out of fear of a Chinese attack, than Turkey freaks the fuck out and launches nuclear weapons on Russia, which, since they're in NATO, also leads to the United States, France and the United Kingdom launching nuclear weapons. **So...we're all utterly fucked just because two small countries had a ISOLATED nuclear dispute**. 

I don't know what scares me more to be honest, Iran's ambitions for nuclear weapons because of United States' encroachment, or Japan's ambitions for nuclear weapons because of the United States' distance *(low confidence in the American nuclear umbrella)*. 

Both can lead to some pretty nasty fucking regional arms race, and it doesn't look like either East Asia nor the Middle East are going to be the most tension-free regions in the next century.

They are often accompanied by [young people](http://imgur.com/8a3nUol), political activists and relatives. Ministers of the government also used to participate in the march up until the year 2000, when it was abolished as an official commemoration.  
However, year after year certain organizations take offense to this procession and they book protests in the same place at the same time. Most notably - [antifa](http://i.imgur.com/R3WpAnh.jpg). They use megaphones and chanting to try and disrupt the procession.  
  
During these events nearly every major news network from Russia sends their camera-crews to Riga and it is the breaking news of the day. Afterwards they use the footage for the whole next year to portray Latvia as a country with raising neo-nazism and and where glorification of Fascism takes place.  
  
Those who participate in the march, on the other hand, remind that Latvians in the SS where mostly conscripts and the plan generally was to defeat the Soviets, then turn against Germany, as in, they were ultimately fighting for an independent country of Latvia. Latvian Legion also was not accused of any war crimes and they even guarded Nazi war criminals during the Nuremberg Trials.

That was really because of the unique historical circumstances of the Iron curtain and communism. Obviously, there wasn't free movement between East Berlin and West Berlin during the Cold War. In much of Western Europe, free movement was extremely easy for a long time before the EU, e.g. at the end of the nineteenth century, Western Europeans travelled around Western Europe very easily. Britain and Ireland had a common travel area long before joining the EU. Londoners and Parisians have almost always found it easy to travel to each others' cities.

&gt; Given the huge number of countries in this world, that means if you're a small country your citizens are severely limited.

There are already small countries that aren't in the EU that already have easy travel arrangements with much of the world, e.g. Switzerland, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, New Zealand.

I don't really find that a problem. EU has 20 or so official languages, and while most non-Anglophone politicians speak at least one more language, I can't expect anyone being comfortable expressing complicated ideas in a language they are not native in, and if they are of certain age, they were never properly instructed in (foreign language education in my country for example is horrible). 

So yeah. If it means communication will be more efficient, use an interpreter instead of being condemned to struggle and fail to convey your ideas in a language you are not competent enough.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"&gt; The main deterrent of NATO is the combined nuclear arsenal of its member states, as well as its collective conventional forces.

Except the combined nuclear arsenal rests only in the hands of three nations, and so too does the collective conventional forces. Outside of France, the UK, and the US, all the other nations add relatively little.

&gt;The more NATO expands, the less military action Russia can take, because its nuclear umbrella expands to those countries as well.

Except there probably wouldn't be any nukes used. So the more NATO expands, the more it is stretched. Adding the militaries of the Nordic nations hardly adds any capabilities to NATO's conventional forces. Adding a few boats, a dozen jets, and a few thousand soldiers does not compensate for the fact the current forces are now obligated to defend even more nations. Nations that are already averse to spending anything on their own defenses, and sees military spending as a waste that only foolish nations do.

&gt;The real reason NATO can't be taken seriously is because many of its European members, including Germany, Italy etc. are dependent on Russian energy imports, such as oil and natural gas. That's why they aren't really taking any action against Russia right now in regards to the Ukraine crisis.

I agree that this is a significant part of it, but nobody should assume NATO can defend the border nations. Nuclear weapons not withstanding, a conventional war means those nations are swallowed and destroyed in the first week. That cannot be argued. It's simply geography. 

The reality is, NATO cannot indefinitely expand. All the major powers are already in NATO. The other contenders are tiny and incapable of contributing anything. How are small nations supposed to contribute? Here's are our one rusty tank? No thanks.

&gt;**Art. 17.**- In the territorial-administrative units in which the citizens belonging to the national minorities by a share of over 20% of the number of the inhabitants, the local public administration authorities shall ensure, in the relations with them, also the use of the mother tongue, in keeping with the provisions of the [Constitution](http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?id=371), of the present law and of the international conventions to which Romania is a party.

and

&gt;**Art. 40.**

&gt;(1) The local council shall meet, monthly, on ordinary sittings, upon the convening by the mayor.

&gt;(2) The local council may also meet in extraordinary sittings at the request of the mayor or of at least one third of the number of the council's members.

&gt;(3) The convening of the local council shall be made in writing, through the secretary of the territorial-administrative unit, by at least 5 days before the ordinary sittings and by at least 3 days before the extraordinary sittings.

&gt;(4) In case of force majeure and of maximum urgency for the solving the interests of the inhabitants of the commune or town, the convening of the local council may be made straight away.

&gt;(5) The invitation to the sitting shall stipulate the date, hour, place where it shall take place, and its agenda.

&gt;(6) The inhabitants of the commune or town shall be informed of the agenda of the local council sitting through mass media or any other means of publicity.

&gt;**(7)** In the communes or towns in which the share of the citizens belonging to a national minority is over 20% of the number of inhabitants, these shall be informed of the agenda also in their language, too.

&gt;(8) In all the cases the convening is recorded in the official report of the sitting. 

*Article 106 is basically the same as Art. 40, only it deals with extraordinary sittings of the Local Councils*

and

&gt;**Art. 90.**

&gt;(1) The Romanian language shall be used in the relations between the citizens and the local public administration authorities.

&gt;**(2)** In the territorial-administrative units in which the citizens belonging to a national minority hold a share of over 20% of the total number of the inhabitants, in their relations with the local public administration authorities and with the own specialty apparatus, they may also address themselves, orally or in writing, in their mother tongue and shall receive the answer both in the Romanian language and in their mother tongue.

&gt;**(3)** Under the terms provided in para (2), persons that know the mother tongue of the citizens belonging to the respective minority shall also be employed in the positions regarding public relations.

&gt;**(4)** The local public administration authorities shall ensure the inscribing of the name of the localities and institutions under their authority, as well as the posting up of the announcements of public interest also in the mother tongue of the citizens belonging to the respective minority, under the terms provided in para (2).

&gt;(5) The official documents shall be compulsorily drawn up in the Romanian language.

true,shudders,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Ukraine does have experience with nuclear weapons and has fielded them in the past, so them creating them isn't that far-fetched

It is far fetched for them. If Russia caught wind of Ukraine pushing for nukes again they would be all over it. And they'd be supported because we all know what direction they would be fired in and because the west can hardly be seen to be aiding Ukrainian nuclear weapons. It wouldn't take much to cripple the Ukrainian economy, as has been shown. As for the US specifically, I think they'd have no problem with sanctioning a nuke aiming Ukraine. It would even help Russian relations.

&gt; But what does worry me? The Middle East and East Asia.

The Middle East is interesting because the US has less of a need for the Middle East due to its forthcoming energy independence. Of course there's an interest in protecting Israel and its current allies, but the USA has no reason to bend over backwards for Middle Eastern oil anymore (save assisting American companies in the region).

I would also argue it is not arbitrary, it was an amount all members agreed on to ensure they had minimum defense capabilities on their own, and if another member was attacked they could contribute something. Also keep in mind, regardless how arbitrary members think the target is, they agreed to it.

It is definitely better for the countries not meeting their targets, but the only question is whether the US, UK, and France will continue subsidizing the other members. The highest official in US Defense threatened to leave NATO in a scathing speech to European defense ministers in 2011. He said he realizes that due to budgetary and political concerns most NATO members could not meet their target anytime soon, but they should at least consolidate forces to avoid redundancy. So far, almost zero consolidation has happened, and there have been more cuts. 

People have mentioned its cheaper overall for one country to have a strong army, and protect the others. That may be true, but considering none of the other countries are contributing to the ""big 3's"" military spending it is not exactly the most fair solution. The US has been steadily cutting its budget and has expressed the desire to move resources from Europe, one of the highest income regions in the world, to other locations.

The US tax code offers many deductions, but the biggest one is that capital gains is taxed at a lower percentage than income. This is to encourage investment, but later in life it is also the largest source of income for billionaires. So having that tiered (like income) instead of a flat rate would go a long way. It was also increased 5% relatively recently as well.

That said, even taxing them more would not bring equality down to say a Swedish level. If someone starts a business and becomes a billionaire I dont think of them as a liability, but rather an asset. If all of these people inherited their wealth it would be one thing, but the vast majority of the richest people in the US started companies that employ people. The Walton family is the big exception. That is a sharp contrast to Europe where the strong majority of billionaires inherited their wealth (Forbes list). 

So if achieving greater equality means kicking wealthy entrepreneurs out, not sure I think that is the best solution.

1.) Importer - if they don´t want to do a big initial investment, they most likely contract an importer doing their work, selling, representoing the brand, marketing, etc. (-1 for you - because you need to be hired by the importer)

* a cutting board will never be cleaned by your flatmates, and your sharp knives, if they are kept razor sharp, will have this demonstrated by flatmates, ending up with chipped knives and possible holes in your walls.

* The pan will never be cleaned, and will get scratched to hell and back by drunk people trying to cook nasty bacon. Buy something you don't mind throwing away.

* For a 1st year uni student? A pestle and mortar? A bit overkill there, let's just hope they know what spices are first.

* Absolutely agree with the pans. Although again, buy something you don't mind disposing at the end of the year.

And they'd be supported because we all know what direction they would be fired in and because the west can hardly be seen to be aiding Ukrainian nuclear weapons. It wouldn't take much to cripple the Ukrainian economy, as has been shown. As for the US specifically, I think they'd have no problem with sanctioning a nuke aiming Ukraine. It would even help Russian relations.

By not being far fetched, I didn't mean them doing it isn't far fetched, I mean them being *capable* of doing it, much more easily than either Iran or North Korea, isn't that far fetched. 

Otherwise I agree with you. 

&gt;The Middle East is interesting because the US has less of a need for the Middle East due to its forthcoming energy independence. Of course there's an interest in protecting Israel and its current allies, but the USA has no reason to bend over backwards for Middle Eastern oil anymore (save assisting American companies in the region).

While true, the majority of the oil in the Middle East, especially Iraq, doesn't go to America. It goes to Europe and China *(an is extracted mostly by European and Chinese corporations)*, which helps keep the petrodollar afloat. 

And even if the United States leaves completely, it still worries me.

 Iran, Israel, and Saudi Arabia don't have the best relations, and the region isn't the most stable in the world, throwing nuclear weapons in the mix, having a nuclear arms race in effect, would be completely destabilizing and pose a honest danger to all of us. As I said, it could only take one shot for everyone to light everyone up, and even if the United States is completely out of the region, it doesn't erase the Shia/Sunni/Jewish tensions.

&gt;Und damit können wir auf jedenfall vermuten, dass bereits die erste Prämisse (in dieser Formulierung) nicht stimmt.

Mir ist klar, dass der Vergleich zum GPG Thema an der Stelle hinkt; meine Intention war nicht ein neues Thema aufzumachen, sondern nur, dir  deine  eigene Kausalität klarmachen.

Denn, mögliche Fehlerquellen bei dir konkret sind

&gt;Damit würde es sich trotzdem lohnen nur Frauen einzustellen.

Wer sagt, dass es sich *nicht* lohnt? Weil die Betriebe nicht zu 100% aus Frauen bestehen? Geht schlecht, weil zu wenig Frauen in bestimmten Wirtschaftszweigen. (Woanders gehts ja vllt, in Dienstleistungsbranchen etwa?)

Wer sagt, dass man 100% Frauen in Betrieben will? Glaub nicht, dass die Betriebskultur in die Richtung will.

&gt;Da das nicht überall passiert, gehe ich davon aus dass das GPG eben KEIN generelles Problem ist.

Wie sollte es überall passieren **können** wenn doch immer noch so wenig Frauen überhaupt berufstätig sind?

Könnte nach dieser Art von Logik auch so sein, dass eben alle Frauendies auf dem Arbeitsmarkt gibt, um Personalkosten zu sparen schon eingestellt werden und es einfach nicht mehr Frauen gibt.

Empirisch belegt und differenziert ist die Behauptung jetzt -genau wie bei dir- nciht.

Fazit:

Alles was ich sagen wollte, war, dass du mit so einer ebenso eindimensionalen wie anfälligen Logik nicht weiterkommst, da da die Empirie bis jetzt in jeder deutschen Studie gegen dich -und für mich- spricht.

Du kannst halt reden was du willst, es gibt für deine Seite leider keine realen Zahlen, die dich stützen, daher ist das nur Theorie. Mein behaupteter Diskriminierungseffekt ist aber sehr stark belegt.

Zwar nicht absolut bewiesen, v.a. nicht in einem endgültigem Betrag festgelegt, aber dennoch genug belegt um die Position vertreten zu können.

&gt; Was ich damit sagen wollte: Gibt es Hinweise darauf, dass die Verteilung von der Norm abweichendt? Oh ja. Banker mit Millionen-Boni und Hausfrauen die sich ein paar Stunden was dazuverdienen.

Ja natürlich wirds da Tendenzen geben in Wirtschaftbranchen wie da EInkommensunterschiede sind, is doch klar. Aber genau das rauszufinden ist ja auch ein Sinn vom GPG.

Nur diese speziellen Details interessieren mich nicht soviel, als dass ich mich so tief in die richtige Studien einlesen würde.

Btw, danke, dass du gerade für die Frauenquote in Vorständen argumentiert hast =)

**Andererseits, hast du wohl noch nicht einmal die Wikipedia Einleitung zum GPG gelesen, weil du schon wieder Scheiße laberst xD**

Ich zitiere und höre auf mir den Mund fusselig zu reden:

&gt;Dabei ist zwischen einem bereinigten und einem unbereinigten Gender Pay Gap zu unterscheiden. Während der unbereinigte Wert die Einkommensunterschiede von Männern und Frauen misst, **wird beim bereinigten Gender Pay Gap eine Verzerrung durch unterschiedliche Ausstattungseffekte – z. B. die unterschiedlichen Ausbildungsgrade, DIE UNTERSCHIEDLICHE BERUFSWAHL, Qualifikation u.ä. von Männern und Frauen – herausgerechnet.**

""Oh ja.""

Aus dem bereinigtem GPG ist die Berufswahl schon draußen. Es wird also das **Durchschnittseinkommen von Mann mit den Durchscnittseinkommen der Frauen NACH BRANCHE GETRENNT** verglichen.

Weißte, ""Wissenschaftler"" denken sich schon was mit ihrer Arbeit, meinst du nicht? Wenn ihre Studie von jedem Trottel hier in reddit debunked werden könnte, wären sie arbeitslos. Also mach dich nicht selber unglücklich hier.

Weißte was? Les den Wikieintrag durch und lies dir mal zusammenfassungen der angesprochenen üblichen Studien durch. Also was ich gemacht hab, vielleicht klappts dann.

Dann kommste wieder, ja?

&gt; Dear readers!
&gt; 
&gt; Today, on March 12 , the owner of ""Afisha - Rambler - SUP"" Alexander Mamut fired chief editor of ""Lenta.ru"" Galina Timchenko. Newly appointed editor is Alexei Goreslavskii - deputy director general for external communications.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, it is not a routine castling, so it requires some explanation. We believe that this appointment is a direct pressure on the editorial staff of ""Lenta.ru"". Dismissal of an independent chief and appointment of a controlled person, including directly controlled from the Kremlin offices - is a violation of the law on the media talking about the inadmissibility of censorship.
&gt; 
&gt; Over the past couple of years the space of free journalism in Russia has decreased dramatically. Some media outlets are directly controlled from the Kremlin, others - through curators, and others - by editors who fear about their jobs. Some media outlets were closed, others will be closed in the coming months. The problem is not that we have nowhere to run. The problem is that you seem to have nothing more to read.
&gt; 
&gt; We certainly expected that they would come for us.
&gt; 
&gt; We believe that this will not last forever. In any case, you, dear readers, should know about it.
&gt; 
&gt; We hope to see you soon.

Yep. Would you prefer that every nation had its own nuclear arsenal? I think that would make the world more dangerous overall.

&gt;Outside of France, the UK, and the US, all the other nations add relatively little.

Why stop there? I'm sure there are certain regions, provinces and states within those countries that add very little as well. Who needs Vermont or Delaware? Kick them out of NATO as well.

Yes, guns and bombs are foolish things to spend money on in this day and age when we should be advanced and civilized. But apparently we are still idiotic monkeys playing around with fancy firecrackers and beating our chests. A failed experiment by nature indeed.

&gt;I agree that this is a significant part of it, but nobody should assume NATO can defend the border nations.

If NATO can't defend its borders then it can't defend the main partners either. If Russia were to attack France or Germany, why should the UK or US help them if Russia is not threatening them?

I think the main point with NATO these days is keeping the peace in the West and protecting economic interests as well. The West is all about business and there are trillions of dollars invested, even in smaller nations with little military strength to add to NATO.

As I said previously, if nobody aids in their defence, then the Russian border may be next to France or Germany in short order, either because Russia annexes them or forms another defence pact like the Warsaw pact. It's actually in Germany and Frances interest to keep any potential conflicts going far away from their borders, in these ""buffer nations"".

&gt; Ja, das ist das, was wir in den Medien gesehen haben. Die Frage ist nun: Wieso steht jemand drei Monate lang auf einem Platz? Hat der nichts zu arbeiten? Ist der mit eigenen Ersparnissen so gut ausgestattet, daß er sich das leisten kann? Wenn nein, wer hat das finanziert?


Hast du den Maidan überhaupt verfolgt? Tagsüber war der Maidan LEER und abends und nachts war er voll von Arbeitern usw. Und ich habe es nciht in den Medien sondern in einem **Livestream** gesehen.


&gt; Daß das aktuelle Regime in Kiev einige sehr ... zweifelhafte Leute beschäftigt, ist ja nichts neues. Aber offensichtlich sind Neofaschisten akzeptable Verhandlungspartner, solange es uns nützt.

Richtig aber die Wahlen stehen noch aus. Außerdem was bringt die Ukraine denn dem Westen? Die Nato wird vllt versuchen die Situation auszunutzen (was ich scharf verurteile) und eine Basis aufzubauen, aber ansonsten wird der Aufbau einer einigermaßen gescheiten Wirtschaft ( Die Jankuwitsch und seine reichen Freunde übrigens voll an die Wand gefahren hat) richtig teuer. 

Außerdem findest du jemanden der auf Demonstranten schießen lässt nicht zweifelhaft?


&gt; Du bleibst einen Beweis schuldig, daß Putin einen Genozid angeordnet hat (eine reine Aufstandsbekämpfung radikalislamischer Kräfte, die Verbindungen zu Al-Quaeda haben, ist kein Genozid, sondern Daseinsvorsorge für den Staat).


Man jagt tscheschenische Terroristen nicht mit der Luftwaffe.Genauso wie man keine 'Schwulenpropaganda' verbietet und Kremelkritiker einsperrt. Und wenn du denkst ich bin pro-USA nope, ich kann einfach nur differenzieren und weiß das es kein Gut und Böse auf der Welt gibt; Jeder hat Dreck am Stecken siehe z.B Guantamo


&gt; Es gibt keine ""Völkerrechte"". Es gibt ""Menschenrechte"" und das ""Völkerrecht"". Es sind mir keine Belege bekannt, daß während der aktuellen Situation auf der Krim Menschenrechte verletzt wurden oder das Völkerrecht (das im Übrigen relativ wertlos ist, siehe Serbien, Irak oder Afghanistan) gebrochen wurde.


Oh das sehe ich anders. Putin hat quasi selbst bestätigt das Soldaten ohne Hoheitszeichen auf der Krim sind in dem er sagte es wären 'lokale Selbstverteidigungsgruppen' außerdem war mir noch garnicht bewusst das wenn einer das Völkerrecht verletzt es der andere jetzt auch tun darf und ich vorallem nicht kritisieren darf , genauso wie ich es beim ****** Irakkrieg getan hab!

Ich werde Quellenbelege liefern, wenn du welche lieferst. Häufig genug haben Nachrichtennachplapperer damit nämlich Probleme und werden pampig...

&gt; Hast du den Maidan überhaupt verfolgt? Tagsüber war der Maidan LEER 

Das ist nicht die Beobachtung, die ich gemacht habe... Und wäre auch unlogisch. Einen *leeren* Platz kann man sperren. 

&gt; Richtig, aber die Wahlen stehen noch bevor.

Also, wenn morgen eine SPD/NPD-gestützte Gruppe Merkel aus dem Land jagt, dann kannst du mit der NPD gut leben, bis zur nächsten Wahl, in der die dann ganz bestimmt nicht in Machtpositionen kommen? 

&gt;  Außerdem was bringt die Ukraine denn dem Westen? 

1. Geringere Probleme mit der Gasversorgung (unter Timoschenko hatte die Ukraine für Deutschland bestimmtes Gas illegalerweise abgezapft...)
2. Stärkerer Zugang zum Schwarzen Meer, damit auch geopolitisch bessere Unterstützung zu Georgien (Wir erinnern uns? Abchasien? Süd-Ossetien?)
3. Drücken der Landwirtschaftspreise (Die Ukraine ist eine Kornkammer...)

&gt; aber ansonsten wird der Aufbau einer einigermaßen gescheiten Wirtschaft ( Die Jankuwitsch und seine reichen Freunde übrigens voll an die Wand gefahren hat) 

Sicher. Aber da hat er nur der guten Julia nachgeeifert. Das politische System des Staatengebildes Ukraine ist korrupt, nicht nur einzelne Vertreter.

&gt;  Außerdem findest du jemanden der auf Demonstranten schießen lässt nicht zweifelhaft?

Ich glaube, daß in einem Rechtsstaat der Staat das Gewaltmonopol hat. Werden Gesetze nicht befolgt, dann hat der Staat das Recht und die Pflicht, dieses Gewaltmonopol zur Wiederherstellung von Recht und Ordnung einzusetzen. 

Janukovic wurde demokratisch gewählt und war/ist legitimes Staatsoberhaupt der Ukraine. Es ist seine **Pflicht** gewesen, die illegale Demonstration auflösen zu lassen.

Nebenbei: Es gibt mehr als einen Hinweis darauf, daß die Mehrzahl der Maidan-Toten von Heckenschützen ausging, die von der Opposition geschickt wurden.

&gt; Man jagt tscheschenische Terroristen nicht mit der Luftwaffe.

Man jagt tschetschenische Terroristen mit jedem Mittel, das in einer Kosten/Nutzen-Analyse am geeignetsten erscheint, die Gefährdung durch selbige Terroristen bei möglichst geringer Gefahr für die eigenen Leute auszuschalten. Platoons, die durch die kaukasische Steppe streifen, werden aufgerieben. Die MiG und deren Pilot sind in drei Minuten wieder auf Heimatkurs bei deutlich größerer Erfolgsquote.

&gt; Genauso wie man keine 'Schwulenpropaganda' verbietet 

Versuche mal, direkt neben einer Grundschule nen homosexuellen BDSM-Schuppen aufzumachen... Das russische Gesetz schreibt im Wesentlichen nur Bannmeilen vor, nicht unähnlich denen, die wir auch haben. 

&gt; und Kremelkritiker einsperrt. 

... wegen Steuerhinterziehung (du weißt, wie Hoeneß) und Aufbau antidemokratischer Gruppierungen (Chodorkowski war dabei, sowas wie eine Chodorkowski-Jugend aufzubauen). Udo Pastörs ist ein Bundeskanzleramtskritiker, und der Konsens ist, daß er weggesperrt gehört.

&gt; Und wenn du denkst ich bin pro-USA nope, ich kann einfach nur differenzieren und weiß das es kein Gut und Böse auf der Welt gibt; Jeder hat Dreck am Stecken siehe z.B Guantamo

Sehr schön. Selbsterkenntnis ist der erste Schritt. Wieso also verteidigst du so vehement die ""gute"" Ukraine?

&gt; Putin hat quasi selbst bestätigt das Soldaten ohne Hoheitszeichen auf der Krim sind 

Er hat bestätigt, daß dort militärisch organisierte Einheiten sind und offengelassen, wer genau diese kontrolliert. Er hat *nicht* von Soldaten gesprochen.

Übrigens: Auch [diese Jungs](http://www.karneval.de/img/content/reiterkorps_pg_koeln_web.jpg) sind militärisch organisiert und tragen keine international anerkannten Hoheitszeichen...

&gt; außerdem war mir noch garnicht bewusst das wenn einer das Völkerrecht verletzt es der andere jetzt auch tun darf! Intressante Kindergartenlogik.

Mein Argument war, daß Völkerrecht nicht das Papier wert ist, auf dem es geschrieben wurde, d.h. faktisch nichtexistent ist.

&gt; wieso waren die soldaten dann nicht in ihrer basis ? 

Weil man in der Basis schlecht verhindern kann, daß ukrainische Freischärlergruppen die Grenze passieren und ein Massaker an der russischen Bevölkerung im Dorf 40km entfernt anrichten.

&gt; wieso auf flughäfen und an der grenzen zum festland?

Relevante Kontrollpunkte, um Truppenaufmarsch und schnelle Verlegung schweren Geräts zu verhindern. Strategie 101.

&gt; Ich denke 'eventuell' ist hier das Schlüsselwort. Jaja 'eventuell' hilft es nach 9/11 auch den Irak zu bombadieren. zz

Dazu werde ich nichts sagen, ich finde diesen Satz aus dem Mund (bzw der Tastatur) sehr bedenklich.


&gt;Nebenbei: Es gibt mehr als einen Hinweis darauf, daß die Mehrzahl der Maidan-Toten von Heckenschützen ausging, die von der Opposition geschickt wurden.



Beweise? Meinst du das verpixelte Video von der Anonymous FB Seite (Die übrigens eine Farce ist, da ein einzelner niemals ein Kollektiv repräsnetieren kann und die eine Agenda pushen) in der ein 'Heckenschütze' in einen Baum schießt? Erstens: Warum schießt ein Scharfschütze (!) ungefähr 2 Meter daneben in einen Baum? Und wieso sieht der Einschlag aus wie von einem Luftgewehr und nicht wie von einer Großkaliberwaffe?

Yeah, you're right about oil situation, but also look at TGV, it's a good alternative (in speed and comfort) to air transport and it didn't use oil (in France almost 75% of our electricity come from nuclear power witch is greener than oil (about local polution, not nuclear wastes that are a different problem (and not the point here). So we have a good alternative to air transport that is not dependent of oil!

I don't think that LGV are that much involved in the extinction of smaller train lines... For me, if there wasn't TGV with the comfort and speed we know today, like in so many other countries, the air transport would be more developed instead of train (for long distances)... (So much much oil-dependant and poluting...).
And about smaller train lines, it's not something new with the construction of LGV, it's something that began during the 20th century : for example, at the beginning of the century, around my home in France, many of small towns were connected with a very local small train (called ""tacot""). It was working because they was no other solution to travel from a town to an other town. After, cars and buses appeared and these small train were removed... And during all the 20th century, local trains were removed, far before the choice of building LGV.

Today, the personnal transportation represented by cars and public transportation with buses have the flexibility to do what we do with trains (at the opposite of begining of 20th century). And I don't think that buses and cars will disapear in the future, they will only be adapted to environnemental considerations and the ""end"" of oil we will probably know soon... We will probably produce maybe electrical cars or hydrogen cars... I believe that greener technologies for transportation will come very soon and this type of transport will probably still as it is today, it will only be adapted.

So my opinion is to think that LGV are still a good choice and will ""protect"" us from a transportation that is too much dependant of oil (like air transport).

Im Schwarzmeerflotten-Vertrag ist nirgendwo vermerkt, dass du aufs Staatsgebiet des Nachbarn rollen darfst, um dort Manöver durchzuführen und in der UN-Charta steht das erst recht nicht drin.

Und nur weil die USA und wir Europäer auch ganz gerne mal beim Völkerrecht ein Auge zukneifen, sollte das nicht bedeuten, dass wir als Normalos da den Mund nicht mehr aufkriegen, wenn es mal jemand anderes macht.

Ich sehe keinen Grund, warum ich da nicht genauso kritisch auf Russland schauen sollten, wenn die sich (auch mal wieder) klar im Unrecht befinden.

Und noch was, ihr beide habt Unrecht, die Krim hat keinerlei verfassungsrechtliche oder (so wie es sich im Moment darstellt) völkerrechtliche Grundlage sich unabhängig von Ukraine zu erklären oder sogar in die Russische Föderation aufgenommen zu werden. Was die machen widerspricht:

- dem allgemeinen Völkerrecht (dies größtenteils dank der allgegenwärtigen russischen Truppen - siehe Stimson-Doktrin, ansonsten kann man das Recht der Krim-Bewohner zur Selbstbestimmung durchaus anerkennen)

- und wenn sie sich tatsächlich der Russischen Föderation anschließen auch ganz direkt der UN-Charta und der Helsinki-Schlussakte (territoriale Veränderungen zwischen zwei Staaten sind nur im Einvernehmen beider Staaten erlaubt)

&gt;  ihr beide habt Unrecht, die Krim hat keinerlei verfassungsrechtliche oder völkerrechtliche Grundlage sich unabhängig von Ukraine zu erklären

Verfassungen lassen sich ändern. 

&gt; der Verfassung der Ukraine (die Ukraine ist ein Einheitsstaat und wenn dann hat der Einheitsstaat eine territoriale Veränderung zu erlauben - siehe zum Beispiel Schottland!),

Wen interessiert eine Verfassung eines Staates, von dem man sich faktisch gelöst hat und de facto nicht mehr die Kontrolle über das eigene Gebiet ausübt?

&gt; dem allgemeinen Völkerrecht (dies größtenteils dank der allgegenwärtigen russischen Truppen - siehe Stimson-Doktrin, ansonsten kann man das Recht der Krim-Bewohner zur Selbstbestimmung durchaus anerkennen)

&gt; Also erstens; Die Tscheschenen dürfen sich nicht abspalten, aber die Russen in der Ukraine dürfen es? Seems fair.

Die Krimrussen haben keine Sprengstoffanschläge in Kiev verursacht - es handelt sich bei den Tschetschenen ganz eindeutig um Terroristen.

Schlau erkannt. Aber auch dann hat der Fußsoldat ein Anrecht darauf, daß die militärische Führung ihn nicht verheizt, wenn es effizientere Wege der Zielerreichung gibt.

&gt; Du bewertest Leben nach dem Ursprung?Wirklich? Ist ein Afghane also weniger wert als du?

Grundsätzlich nicht - wenn ich vor der Entscheidung ""der Afghane oder ich"" stände, würde der Afghane allerdings eher schlecht aussehen. Genauso ""der Afghane oder die folgenden Personen, die mir näher stehen"". 

&gt; Wie wäre es wenn die Supermächte aufhören würden in anderen Ländern rumzupfutschen; ein Putsch in Chile hier; ein paar Waffen an Sadam da.

Das Problem ist, dass diese Leute sich im akademischen Betrieb breitzumachen begonnen haben, und dass sie den Anspruch entwickelt haben, andere Fachbereiche zu »verbessern«.  Da der akademische Bereich die Brutstätte für das Recht und die Politik der Zukunft ist, werden wir irgendwann vor dem Problem stehen, dass diese Leute die Sprache gesetzlich regeln, d.h. diesen Schwachsinn für alle verbindlich machen wollen.  Vorläufer dieser Tendenz gibt es bereits.  Dabei fällt auf, dass Gender-Studies und alle artverwandten Fächer keinerlei wissenschaftlichen¹, aufklärerischen oder emanzipatorischen Gehalt mehr haben.  Ihnen entspringt keinerlei Erkenntnisgewinn über die Funktionsweise der Gesellschaft mehr, wie ihn Adorno und Horkheimer noch produzierten, und trotzdem ziehen sie aus der Tatsache, dass sie an den Universitäten die dominierende »Denkschule« stellen, Legitimitätsansprüche zur Veränderung der Gesellschaft.  Beim Rassenantisemitismus lief es ähnlich, und er war nur deswegen leichter zu durchschauen, weil seine Effekte sehr viel krasser waren.  Es besteht die reelle Chance, dass wir mit diesem Phänomen noch sehr lange zu schaffen haben werden.

&gt; In den Siebzigern wurden an unseren Unis Kampfschriften in einem Propagandadeutsch verfasst, dass das hier im Vergleich ungefähr auf dem Neuigkeitslevel von Schulhof-Geheimsprachen ist.

Es ist ein Unterschied, ob man die Sprache auf der vokabularischer Ebene oder auf grammatischer und morphologischer Ebene umzubauen versucht, weil letzter Ansatz sich am Kern der Sprache zu schaffen macht.

true,CurtHoliday352,UNSA,United States of America,"I seriously doubt we'd ever get into a shooting war with Russia over Ukraine, but I agree with everything else you said. Any potential war would be over something like Estonia or Finland; I can't even see us moving for Moldova as long as it's outside Romania. 

That said, to avoid thermonuclear holocaust, any war would also probably be short, limited and decisive. 

And yeah, the Black Sea Fleet is finished. Even if it isn't sunk, as it can't do shit if Turkey closes the Bosporus Straits. And if we do sink it, it won't be through submarines or anything, it'll be through B2s and F-35s, something that can break through the Russian AA defense *(the most advanced in the entire world)*. And even then, we might ignore it and just lock down the Bospherus Strait, sending the B2s and F-35s to go take out the Russian Atlantic Fleet, which is a much larger concern as it could fuck up our entire logistical network *(which Russian submarines will be doing anyway)*. 

An American destroyer is out there now in the Black Sea, but that's for show. If things popped off all the men on that ship are dead; Russia is tracking it and will saturate it with so many missiles it will cease to be an actual object in existence. The whole reason it's there is to *dare* Russia to destroy it, just like when we sent that big-ass defenseless B-52 across China's newly-declared ADIZ. Sure, it'd be blown up easily, but it's a *dare* to blow it up. 

But like I said, any war between two major nuclear powers is going to be short, decisive and limited. Neither want to escalate beyond conventional warfare, and neither want to fight to the point it turns into *""Total War""*, so power projection and expeditionary forces *(like Marines &amp; Paratroopers)* are going to be key *(in my opinion)*. The downside being Europe, while having some of the most well-trained and technologically advanced militaries in the world, lacks power projection and the necessary infrastructure to use it *(global military bases, large blue water navies, large number of refueling tankers and cargo planes)*, and since time is the deciding factor, probably any retaliation will be coordinated between a small, tailored force from the United Kingdom, France and the United States forces instead of a huge, roving NATO army, and even then, there's no time for indecision so you might just see the U.S. or like US/France or US/Britain go it alone if any arguments between them pop-up, as there'd be no time to negotiate and re-align. 

Of course, *all of this* is just my Armchair General opinion and predictions. 

**NOTE:** An the F-35s arn't even in service yet, so it may just fall to our single squadron of B2s for hitting Russia's heavily-defended *(AA-networked)* backyard.

**NOTE2:** And I really do hope war is avoided, for the sake of all the servicemen on both sides, but most importantly for the sake of the innocent civilians who will without a doubt be caught in the cross-fire. :(

Yet almost [unanimously](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ztbsz/the_french_train_company_sncf_has_been_told_it/) people were talking about what bullshit it was local politicians were blocking a bid from a French company to build high speed rail in the US at the request of Holocaust survivors (they transported prisoners to concentration camps). 

My friend's grandma lived in a concentration camp and watched Nazis shoot her newborn sister to death. 

I fail to see how at a local level this type of thinking is abhorrent and stupid, but at a national level it seems to be defended fairly often. 

I am not saying this is you, but it seems very prevalent on this sub. People constantly talk about how the war took a toll on Germany (which undoubtedly it did) and that 70 years is not long enough to get over it. But as soon as Holocaust survivors try to block projects by companies that collaborated with Nazis they're seen as money hungry and irrational. Many of them dont want reparations at all (my friend's grandma doesnt) she just doesn't want them involved in public projects where she lives. 

Even my best friend thinks its ""fucking ridiculous"" how his grandma thinks. I think it is ridiculous as well. But we are lucky enough to never have been rounded up from our homes, shipped like cattle to a place where many of our family members were systematically murdered. 

Sorry for the wall of text, but I've noticed that *huge* double standard on this sub (and reddit) so many times.

true,CurtHoliday352,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; Agreed :/ It'd probably be a fighting retreat doing maximal damage to the invading army and their economy and wait them to crash economically till putin forget one last time to check his glass for warfarin and one of his entourage kills him like staline.

I think it'd be more like what we saw happened in Crimea. You move and you seize before the other guy can even react. If it works, you have the entire territory and the other guy either has to accept it or mobilize for *""Total War""*. 

It sucks for Ukraine because it has no hope of winning a conventional war against Russia, it sucks for us because nobody has any hope of winning a thermonuclear war. 

So, let's say for example: Russia invades Estonia. I believe, in my opinion, that the fate of Estonia will be determined by who wins the opening battle *(for the country)*. Estonia's fate will depend on how fast the United States/NATO can get Marines and Paratroopers into there while *it's still contested*. Even if it means driving a Carrier Taskforce through a Russian submarine-infested Baltic Sea, because, once again I must emphasis *this is my armchair general opinion*, if Estonia falls completely *(to whomever wins the battle)*, than the country/alliance who loses it is not going to take it back *(or get the chance to take it back, so they'll willingly accept defeat, so as to avoid nuclear escalation...hopefully)*. 

Neither Russia nor the West *(alright....MAYBE Russia....crazy bastards...but for this argument we'll say they won't)* will not want to go nuclear or conduct a first-strike over Estonia. An if either of us do mobilize for conventional total war over Estonia, I highly doubt we'll actually conduct total war *(I.E. Huge NATO armies advancing across massive swathes of Europe against similar sized and positioned Russian armies)*, as I can honestly see no way which that doesn't escalate into thermonuclear warfare....which I don't think anybody wants. 

So, in my opinion, there won't be long, drawn out massive wars *(which in this day and age, are all but guaranteed to end in nuclear holocaust, as I pointed out above)*, but rather short, limited and decisive wars, so as to avoid nuclear escalation. 

This is the same military doctrine which China has applied to any potential conflict in the South China Sea involving the many territorial disputes it has with it's neighbors in the region, many of whom, like NATO, possess mutual defense pacts with the United States. 

And this is why power projection and fast reaction forces *(I.E. Paratroopers &amp; Marines)* are, in my opinion, probably the most important deciding factors in modern day warfare.

Of course....this is the same logic that the German Empire used in WWI and the Japanese Empire used in WWII....both of which inevitably ended up as ""Total War"" scenarios...but fuck....I think the point still stands, given that the introduction of nuclear weapons has completely reshaped the game as we know it; Although....using the same strategy as the two countries which started....*and lost*.....the first two world wars doesn't bode well for this *(hypothetical)* war and it's chances of not snowballing into WWIII.....but I really don't see many other options in which two nuclear-armed states/alliances can go to war and avoid nuclear escalation...so it's literally the only workable scenario which doesn't end in nuclear holocaust.

I would suggest the Mobilis, which is the unlimited day pass, or the Navigo Decouverte.  Here's the math breakdown..

Navigo Decouverte - 5€ for photo plus 5€ for pass plus 34€ for the week, 44€ total (39€ if you bring a photo)

Mobilis - 7€ per day for the four days you stay in the city, 16€ for the one day you go out to Zone 5.  44€ total

The Mobilis works on all public transport and is good for the calendar day you purchase it.  The downside is that you can't buy them in advance so you'll have to go to a station and purchase one every day.  Not a big deal but it may be worth it to you to take the extra time on your first day to get the Decouverte so you don't have to deal with it.

For the Navigo Decouverte you'll either need to get a photo at the Photomaton machines in most Metro stations (5€) or bring some passport-style photos with you.  You'll have to go to one of the ticket windows and pay them 5€ to get your card made and then load it up for a week.

However, **BIG warning** - the Navigo ""week"" runs Monday through Sunday.  If you arrive on a Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, you'll end up having to purchase a second week (or an extra day pass), greatly increasing the price.  Only go for the Decouverte if your 5 day stay begins on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.  Otherwise the daily Mobilis is much cheaper.

Edit:  Also, the tickets are magnetized, so if you do go with the Mobilis, make sure to keep it in its own pocket away from coins, credit cards, keys, anything metal or magnetic.

They could be using a language which is only spoken by 1% of the population, and it wouldn't matter for most people because anything he says would be translated into all the other languages being used in the EU. Yes, translation might cause a minor time delay which could be avoided by having everyone speak English, but really, how often are people in a position where they need to *immediately* know exactly what a government official is saying?

The only people who would be affected by making English (or any language) an official language would be the upper level government officials when they talk to each other in real time. Even then though, if they're actually doing their jobs and talking about important political matters, accuracy is probably more important than the convenience of a *lingua franka*, so using their native language might still be a better option. 

Besides, the anglosphere already gets a lot of flack about having a dominating global presence, and the EU gets a lot of flack about being detached from ""real"" European citizens.

Quando ero all'uni facevo il volontario all'ESN, un'associazione di studenti erasmus. Quando non organizzavamo feste alcoliche, predisponevamo delle guide pratiche per gli studenti in arrivo. Anche Lille ha ESN: http://www.esnlille.fr/ - se il sito non fosse lento marcio, ci avrei fatto un giro per vedere se c'era qualcosa. Prova pure a contattarli, ma non ci contare molto, sono studenti volontari e a noi giovani trentenni lavoratori potrebbero cagarci poco

Cerca queste keyword su google ""**erasmus france bank account residence crazy**"", senza virgolette. La parola ""crazy"" sta lì per far saltare fuori testimonianze informali di qualcuno che magari sarà stato in situazioni simili alle tue. Non ho approfondito, ma la prima pagina di risultati non sembra male.

Cercando invece ""**proof of residence france**"" ho trovato [un forum di expat](http://www.expatforum.com/expats/france-expat-forum-expats-living-france/118653-proof-residence-proof-address.html) in cui uno scrive:

&gt; For what purpose do you need the proof of residence? [...] If it's to open a bank account in France, you use what you've got, even if it's temporary, and you change your address with the bank as soon as you've moved into your more permanent digs.

Con le stesse parole chiave ho trovato anche http://www.readyforfrance.com/ , che tra l'altro è un sito fatto dalla banca HSBC, proverei a vedere se hanno scritto qualcosa.

i bet the reason russians invaded was more because of what happened in the rest of ukraine before/during maidan, rather than what happened in ukraine at maidan was because later russia was soon to invade (see that logic?).


Reddit has turned into a big Fox News-esque community where anything anti-rus, with literally zero fact checks or reality checks,gets  upboated to infiniti and anyone actually asking if that is the case gets destroyed totally, what happened to rationality on reddit or at least a little bit of scepticism? i was merely pointing out that shit was going down in ukraine before russia invaded, not after they invaded as cyridius CLEARLY wrote.

im totally against what russia is doing, however if how people behave on reddit reflect how people think in ukraine then honestly, Russia can have that piece of dirtywater europe, or at least divide it so they dont destroy themselves. There is literally no difference between warmongering american Right and reddit right now, so few rational arguments or suggestions on how to solve this conflict.

Especially since it doesn't have nuclear weapons up it's sleeve *(which means even if they did manage to, which is the slimmest fucking chance in the world, take back Crimea from Russia, they wouldn't of had the nuclear trump card to stop Russia from immediately launching a 2nd Offensive.)*. 

**Hell, Ukraine is fucked if Russia invades in general.** 

The only thing Ukraine can do in such a scenario is go *""Total War""* and shit like Finland in 1939, but given the terrain and Russian sympathies in Eastern Ukraine/Crimea, there's no chance it hell they'll win. 

Even Finland lost the Winter War and had to give up some pretty strategic and valuable territory. 

So, Ukraine's choices, *in my personal armchair opinion are*: 

*A.* Do as good as Finland, but lose Eastern Ukraine, Crimea, and possibly portions of Western Ukraine. Then try to pull a *""Vietnam""* with West Ukraine resembling North Vietnam, with partisans chipping away at Russia in Crimea/Eastern Ukraine. 

*B.* Do worse than Finland, lose the entire country, but hope they can do as good as the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan and make the occupation too costly. 

So yeah, as I mentioned numerous times before, Ukraine is fucked completely against Russia. It's either the country being torn in half and a decade or more of well-coordinated guerrilla warfare against Russia *(best-case scenario)*, or the entire country being occupied and a decade or more of loosely-coordinated guerrilla warfare against Russia *(worst-case scenario)*. 

The most it can hope for is cutting it's losses now with Crimea. And that depends on two things: Russia's goodwill and America's willingness to defend them. And, at the moment, it doesn't look like America has *any intention* of moving militarily against Russia for Ukraine, so it really all depends on Russia's goodwill and whether they decide to invade or not. Because if they invade, Ukraine is in for a real shitty, shitty time for the next decade or two; and if they lose? Well then, they could be in for a real shitty time for the next century *(than again, maybe Russia might be good to Ukraine this time in contrast to the past couple centuries? Though I don't think many Ukranians are going to go for that)*.

true,Seefor,DENK,Copenhagen,"Yes, which is why a Nordic Union probably won't happen until that is resolved. And it is a rather unrealistic scenario that Denmark, Sweden and Finland would leave the EU for that to happen, and I would personally certainly not be glad to see that happen, since I fully believe that our place is in Europe. The more realistic scenario is that Norway joins the EU sometime in the future. Then our international commitments would be in line to make a Nordic Union within the EU possible.

Anyhow, I am not completely convinced as to the virtues of a Nordic Union. Yes, we would have more weight, but on the other hand we'd also lose our separate council votes and we'd lose the ability to lobby for legislation, which fits our specific situation as a country better, since there are still differences between the Nordic nations - especially when it comes to resources. And as a NATO country there are no tangible security guarantees to be gained, which we don't already have.

I think a better alternative, which we could also do without Norway, would be an increased formal cooperation between the Nordic EU countries in which agreements are made to lobby jointly on the issues where agreement between the Nordic countries can be reached. The existing [Nordic Council](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_Council) would have to be strengthened and the Nordic ministers should meet quite often, and especially before EU council meetings, and work to reach a common policy.

One of the things keeping UDMR's monopoly on the Hungarian electorate is the 5% hurdle.

Baltic countries were admitted for geopolitical reasons- to put pressure on Russia, and help cement liberal democracy in those countries. No one has ever been under the illusion that they would be able to help out much in a war, and the fact that they don't pay their full dues is not a major concern. NATO was founded as- and remains- a military coalition meant to contain Russian aggression. We want to be crawling all over their borders. 

&gt;Is it worth worsening our relationship with Russia over a handful small border states?

Absolutely. Russia is bullying its neighbors into joining their Eurasian Union, and threatening destabilization on the periphery of the Europe Union. Russia is again attempting to create an alternative system to the liberal international order, and this time it's a much more conservative and cynical vision.

Let's assume you open a small business and generate a profit of 100000 EUR. You will only keep 52131 EUR. That's a taxation rate of nearly 50%. It will rise over 50% once you start spending that money on your daily necessities (19% VAT, property tax, etc.). I don't know how it sounds to you but to me working for the state is not really my idea of economic freedom.

My personal pain level where I start to find (income) taxes unfair is above 30%.

Luckily there's quite a few countries in the EU that have implemented a flat tax of around 20%. (Which doesn't only save money but also a lot of time when doing taxes. You don't need to move earnings into the next year to not scratch at some progression level that would cost you too much. You just know: You always will pay 20% taxes.)

Buut ... the tentacles of German tax claims are far reaching. You've seen it in Switzerland, Luxembourg and Austria who were forced to either raise taxes or cut their banking secrecy laws.

* Investitionsschutz bedeutet im Klartext neue außergerichtliche Klagemöglichkeiten für internationale Unternehmen gegen öffentliches Handeln. 
* Die Verbraucherschutzstandards für Lebensmittel sind in Europa (zurecht) strenger als in den USA. Sollten in einem Handelsabkommen die Sicherheitsstandards der USA anerkannt werden, wäre dieser Schutz weg.
* Das TTIP wäre de facto unumkehrbar: Einmal unterzeichnet, können die Bündnispartner (also die Staaten) nur mit der Zustimmung aller Vertragsparteien wieder aus dem Bündnis aussteigen.

None where conditional, and they helped some pretty desperate parties that where freshly elected(low electoral risk).

The barrier needs to stay, we aren't mature enough for 4-5 party coalitions. What needs to go is the notion of national parties, currently local representation is monopolised by national parties because the small ones can't even register. And national campaigns have exponentially a higher cost, which in term means more political favors after you win.

true,_delirium,DENK,Denmark,"I think finding ""how are you?"" a weird way to start to a conversation is specifically a northern European, Germanic/Scandinavian thing, not a general US–Europe difference. It's the idiomatic way to start a conversation in a lot of countries, e.g. ¿cómo está(s)? in many Spanish-speaking ones. The semantics are vaguely like the American one as well: you can give a brief ""fine, how about you?"", *but* you can talk about how your day is going too, if you want. Depends on the situation, how well you know the person, personalities, whether you feel like saying anything more or not, etc.

I think some of the reason it seems weird in northern Europe is that, in Scandinavia at least, it's unthinkable that you would answer the question with any detail unless you know the person really well, because people just aren't very open. So it seems weird that people ask it. But in some countries it's perfectly fine to answer ""how are you?"" with ""been a shitty day, [insert description]"".

This is an idea that will only invite disaster. 

&gt;Russia is bullying its neighbors into joining their Eurasian Union, and threatening destabilization on the periphery of the Europe Union. Russia is again attempting to create an alternative system to the liberal international order, and this time it's a much more conservative and cynical vision.

This is one interpretation of Russian intentions. I think it would be wise to pay attention to the Russian interpretation as well. By swallowing up the nations on its borders, we are forcing Russia to react. This is the epitome of foolishness. The West says we are bringing those nations into our fold to protect them from Russia. Russia sees things very differently. We shouldn't needlessly antagonize Russia over some seemingly insignificant nations. 

&gt;With each additional NATO member the West draws a line in the sand that Russia does not dare cross. Who cares if they don't like it? They can either play ball in accordance with the international system they're now part of, or face isolation and economic ruin like the Soviet Union.

true,CurtHoliday352,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;I'm sorry, but that is complete bullshit. Russia doesn't want Ucraine to be Russia, it wants Ucraine to be a buffer between it and the western countries. It wants to look strong. Ukraine has no chance in direct warfare with Russia, but there's a whole slew of problems arising from Russia attacking Ukraine, international treaties kicking into place and the various interests of other countries in the area.

No, it's not complete bullshit. I'm not saying Russia *will* invade, but I am saying it is a *very real* possibility. 

And I never said Russia wants Ukraine *in* Russia, but I do contend that Russia needs Ukraine *in* the Eurasian Union if it's actually going to become a viable, influential and competitive institution *(Instead of CIS.2)*.

I think you underestimate just how important Ukraine is to Russia's sphere-of-influence. Let me put it like this, if Russia doesn't convince Ukraine to join the Eurasian Union, it ain't shit in the coming world. We're going into a *""Asian Century""*, as many have dubbed it, a multi-polar world, dominated by the United States, the European Union *(possibly if it integrates)*, Russia *(possibly if it's Eurasian Union gets off the ground)* and China, with Brazil, India and possibly South Africa coming up from behind. 

Russia just doesn't **want** Ukraine, it **needs** Ukraine. It's need's it's economic strength, it population, if it wants to compete with other global great powers in the future. Kazakhstan and Belarus arn't going to be able to carry Russia to greatness alone, and don't think for a second Russia doesn't realize this, hence why they're pushing so hard to influence Ukraine. 

&gt;Also, Ukraine has a population of around 45 million. Georgia was 4.5 million, Finland is in the same area. Ukraine is 10 times as big. It is a big country and it is not possible for Russia to seize it by force and keep it so. Russia wouldn't even want that. They only want it under their control. 

With half the country possibly vulnerable to Russian agents working with local opposition, and half the population possibly passive about any Russian intervention *(hell, who says that up to a 1/10th of the population won't actually support it?)*. 

And you act like it's a impossibility....but ugh....[maybe you should read this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Ukraine). This wouldn't be the first time Russia has invaded and occupied Ukraine, since **the last time Russia stayed for 220 years**.

&gt;No, your fantasies of all-out warfare will not come to life, I'm sorry. Russia will rig the referendum(yes they will rig them, because who in their right mind would want to be a part of Russia, really now) and keep Crimeea as a part of Russia - Crimeea never should have left Russia in the first place. Ukraine will have payed for its independence from Moscow with a piece of it. It will somehow learn to live with a spiteful neighbor and hopefully not fall pray to nationalists and rusofobia. Russia will get international sanctions. 

Crimea didn't leave Russia, Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine. And it's funny, because Ukraine was apart of Russia for half-a-century longer than Crimea was apart of Russia, since Russia had conquered it from Turkey. 

And *stop putting words in my mouth*. **I don't want no fucking war**, I don't even want sanctions, but I'm not stupid enough to think neither is a possibility nor a necessity, respectfully, at times. The ones that suffer the most are the innocent civilians on both sides, not the soldiers fighting the war or the politicians directing it. In wars, entire houses with families in them can be misidentified and blown-up, kids can be hit by a stray bullet on the way to school; in peace, economic sanctions can lead to you loosing everything you own, to being unable to acquire or afford medicine for your daughter or mother which they desperately need *(because you can't cut off a government's revenue stream without crippling an economy, and you can't cripple a economy without disenfranchising the population)*. 

It's fucked up, and it shouldn't happen, but it happens for a reason, and at times those reasons are justified and necessary in international relations. Simple as that. It's fucked up, but at times it's needed.

&gt;No other country on this green earth will ever relinquish their nuclear weapons.

Nei centri internet andavo su siti che venivano pubblicati ogni tanto su Topolino, ma erano perlopiù siti poco interessanti e troppo infantili.

Flax and hemp keep living
While some are endeavoring to develop environment-friendly engines, others strive to develop healthier interiors, lighter and less dependent on oil resources. To do this, some players in the automotive industry are now confident to new eco-friendly materials such as flax and hemp. At Faurecia, for example, mixing it with petroleum components (NAFILean) now reduces the weight of parts from 20 to 25%.

As will be held from March 11 to 13 next to the Porte de Versailles the new edition of the JEC, the international exhibition for composites, the European Confederation of Flax and Hemp (CELC) take this event to highlight this sector, including any evolution in research and development, with the industrial sector. And to seduce them, CELC launch this occasion a harmonized template sheets for preforms in order to deliver professional reliable data, as measured by standard methods.

In parallel, the Confederation and the JEC organized for the first time a visitor path ""Meet the actors of flax and hemp."" Wednesday between 2:15 p.m. 1:15 p.m. ET, visitors visit the booth D78 7.2 to meet the various players in the industry, but also to discover the bio-based solutions.""",0,1394667649,null,0,false,0,cg15mnm,t3_209wdu,t1_cg15mnm,t3_209wdu,null,1432775265,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
