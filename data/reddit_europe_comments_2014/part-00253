Tarragona is quiet, less every year, but is a quiet city. In fact, this is one of the reasons why I left: it was too boring for someone at his 20s. If you want to work in advertising as it was my case, there is nothing here, and with this example I think you can make yourself an image of what the projections for young people are. More bad aspects: as someone said summers are terrible. We have a lot of humidity all the year but in summer we can get 35° easily. Winters are soft, it snows once every 10 years, it rarely goes down 0°. 
Good aspects: depending on which is your life style, Tarragona is a good place to LIVE, I mean live, and let live: it's not stressful as Barcelona, you have different types of areas to live, it's not dead in winters and not crowded in summers, at least not yet.
There's Barcelona at 1hour drive/train, and it's priceless to go and return in the same day, avoiding living there. Same with the Pyrinees: go skiing and be walking on the beach at sunset (also, really nice beaches!). If you like mountain, we also have it at 20 min.
If you like history you'll love Tgn, it was the capital city of the Roman Empire, and wherever you go there are traces of that. There are interesting towns near like Reus and party areas like Salou with theme parks and so on.

FED and BoE had a much more agressive monetary policy, ECB, granted mired in legal uncertainty, was far more cautious. And it shows in the results. That's a consequence of policy, not scale.

Re comparisons of the systems, well the scales of the EU and US are similar. But I really dislike many features of the US system (citizen juries, role of precedent, first-past-the-post, 2-year MP mandates, presidentialism, ~~near~~-equal votes for states in the senate, police brutality, prison overpopulation, death penalty, gun laws, lack of substantial social protections, aggressive foreign policy and military expenditure - though one would hope it would come in handy in a situation such as this thread is about. hope.). But having federalism that is - we need a stronger center such as that. Germany though? I'm really impressed by its constitutional arrangements.

Re Germany running the EU, even that's overstating it. They either have veto and naturally use it to protect their own interests, like everyone else, or a proportionate vote by whatever's the relevant metric, just like everyone else. Disproportionate power swelled when they were having a boom at a time of a severe bust elsewhere, and so in a position to dictate terms. Not collegial, true, but prob as much as the voters there could swallow (and I would expect no more from any other block of voters either), and generally just a shitty situation however you approach it. I'm moderately apologist on this, since on the one hand the policies were often clearly destructive, but on the other, the room to maneuver to a better outcome so severely limited, that at times I find it miraculous even the minimum that was done, got done.

There's far too little solidarity and trust between citizens of member states still for things to be done rationally. But substantial integration is fairly young, time for it to happen unless it just blows apart.

Re juries, well ofc - quality of rule of law is a prerequisite for any kind of say human rights protection having much meaning. And for just such reasons, law doesn't seem like a matter for nonprofessionals to participate in meaningfully. Simply leaves room for rhetoric or prejudice to overcome legal reasoning - and one would have to stretch to fairly populist arguments in favor. Anyhow, it was a long list, with this only one mention - point was basically how alien it all really is to the continental system, from judicial, executive, legislative, social, even criminal systems. It all seems wrong. And one can ofc make arguments that it is, from one perspective at least. So it appears really undesirable.

Eh, IDK the possibility of ignoring international law may come with the territory of being a veto-wielding superpower, and certainly I wouldn't want a democracy of such magnitude to be totally disengaged. But there's disengaged, and then there's doing whatever you wish to do, however illegal for anyone not having such a privileged status, or just with more regard to following proper steps to do.

&gt; According to Ethnos, at 12:30 on Saturday night, a group of 10-15 people beat two men drinking beer in the bench area. As mentioned victims initially 2-3 assailants attacked them hurling racist verbal descriptions and then fired against them bleach and greywater. Shortly after, the point was a group of 10-15 people, with black shirts and shaved head, which beat them.

Nah, there was too much freedom for everyone to do almost everything. Some people (mostly thugs and politicians) used it in own favor, and lots of people suffered cause of it. Politicians gave promises and never fullfiled them. And at some point a thug would want to become a politician, with all the consequences. So people abstract themself from it. And after Yeltsin, Putin was a breath of fresh air. Yet if you breathe same air for dozen of years, air only getting worse.

true,aeloen,null,null,"I've stayed in several nice places within the Aurelian walls:

Hotel Nazionale - good central location, 5 mins walk to Pantheon and just around the corner from Giolitti's gelato which is a popular ice cream place. Also a short stroll to Piazza Navona and hundreds of restaurants 

Albergo del Senato - in piazza della rotunda - where the Pantheon is. Pricey but special..

Hotel mediterraneo - further out from historic centre, right near Termini train station. Great location for access to transport links which will take you both into the centre but also further afield. 

Hotel Villa Torlonia - quite a distance from the centre but a lot cheaper as a result but pleasant place. 

None of those hotels in Rome had a pool or hot tub. I think you will find it very difficult to find one in the centre. 

Space is a premium in Rome and if you are American (assumption) you will find the hotels very small and maybe a bit more basic than you are used to. Don't let this put you off - Rome is one of the most incredible cities in the world and you should spend all your time outside of the hotel!

If you have your heart set on a pool/hot tub then I think you will need to be much further from the centre. There are lots of hotels on the outskirts which are both significantly cheaper and have more modern facilities like pools etc. However you are likely to be 30-40 mins from the centre of Rome if you do this. I would strongly advise against this - although public transport is pretty good in Rome you don't want to spend up to an hour each way per day just getting into where the action is. Rome is best seen on foot - there's always something fascinating around the corner you would miss on a bus/metro train. 

Top places to see (other than the usual suspects of colosseum, pantheon, forum, Vatican city)

* Basilica San Clemente - excellent church with excavations underneath going back 2000 years

* The Aventine Keyhole - on the Aventine hill a unique view over Rome.

* The Baths of Diocletian (Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri) - church constructed from the ruins of the Baths with fantastic vaulted ceilings.

* Capitoline Museums - for a  rainy day perhaps?

* Piazza del Popolo / Villa Borghese - Great square and sprawling gardens. In the square there are several churches with fantastic Caravaggio paintings. In Villa Borghese there is a museum and acres of green land which you can rent segways/biycyles or 3 wheeled cycle/car things to drive around.

* Via Appia Antica 'The Appian Way' - this can be reached from the Piramide metro station. You then take a local bus out to the first part of the road, and then you can get out and walk along the (2000 year old, with original paving slabs) road and there are lots of ruins, temples and mausoleum's all along the route. Really worth the trip if you want a nice walk.

If you want to go slightly further afield on a day trip away from Rome I would recommend:

* Ostia Antica - Rome's old sea port

* Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli - sprawling private complex of the Emperor who build 'The Wall'

* Frascati - for wine tasting/tours

I see that others have already replied, giving you better info that I could ever give you (I don't use trains to move that much... like, once or twice per year?)

Bullet points:

- it won't take you more thank 45-50 minutes, IF...

- ...the train is on time: Freccia Rossa, Freccia Bianca and Freccia Argento usually have the highest priority as it concerns time of departure and arrival, that's why i would suggest you to avoid the ""Regionale/Interregionale"" type of trains even if they cost like.. half the fare of the Freccia ones; it's VERY EASY for trains to have a late departure (indirect experience of my girlfriend taking the train 5 times a week for 4 years now, but we're kind of far from Bologna)

- If you buy the ticket online, you usually have a big discount, sometimes as much as 50% of the ticket! [Here](http://www.trenitalia.com/cms/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=4ddd1a035296f310VgnVCM1000005817f90aRCRD) you can find the english version of Trenitalia website.

- Be prepared for the grumpiness of some employees of the train companies; sometimes you're lucky and find nice people, but most of the time you'll find lazy people that won't go that far to help you for anything. That's usually because they are working and YOU bastard ignorant foreigner are making them work MORE than the minimum they can do! Sometimes you can find the helpful kind of people tho...

- Be prepare for the train to not be in the best condition as far as cleanliness is concerned...

Why? This is really wishful thinking on the part of Westerners. China has always been far more concerned with SE Asia rather than North. They signed border agreements with Russia to trade land. They've done the same with Mongolia, Central Asia and they are desperately trying to do the same in SE Asia and India. If they violate an agreement they signed with the only country that is close to them, then China would be fucked.China has more to lose than gain from Siberia.

&gt; The Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) (Russian: Федера́льная слу́жба безопа́сности Росси́йской Федера́ции (ФСБ), tr. Federal'naya sluzhba bezopasnosti Rossiyskoy Federatsii (FSB); IPA: [fʲɪdʲɪˈralʲnəjə ˈsluʐbə bʲɪzɐˈpasnəstʲɪ rɐˈsʲijskəj fʲɪdʲɪˈrat͡sɨjɪ]) is the principal security agency of the Russian Federation and the main successor agency to the USSR's Committee of State Security (KGB). Its main responsibilities are within the country and include counter-intelligence, internal and border security, counter-terrorism, and surveillance as well as investigating some other types of grave crimes. It is headquartered in Lubyanka Square, Moscow's centre, in the main building of the former KGB. The Director of the FSB since 2008 is army general Aleksandr Bortnikov.
&gt; 
&gt; The immediate predecessor of the FSB was the Federal Counterintelligence Service (FSK) of Russia: on 12 April 1995, Russian president Boris Yeltsin signed a law mandating a reorganization of the FSK, which resulted in the creation of the FSB. In 2003, the FSB's responsibilities were widened by incorporating the previously independent Border Guard Service and a major part of the abolished Federal Agency of Government Communication and Information (FAPSI). The two major structural components of the former KGB that remain administratively independent of the FSB are the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) and the State Guards (FSO).
&gt; 
&gt; Under the federal law, the FSB is a military service just like the Armed Forces, the MVD, the FSO, the SVR, the FSKN and EMERCOM's civil defence, but its commissioned officers do not normally wear military uniform.

Neither Sweden nor Finland had permanent military bases in their countries. This is a great reason to expand your sphere of influence and infiltrate those countries.

Sometimes this all just looks like a long-term plan of the US. The US started destabilizing Ukraine more than a decade age, spent billions of dollars on anti-Russian politics . Then the situation escalates and they are suddenly all surprised that it happened, as if nobody saw it coming for years. 

I thought these tactics only work in countries nobody cares about, like those of the Middle East. I thought Europe and Russia would take a united stand against the US. But instead Russia acted on its own and Europe completely ignored US aggression... not only that, they actually took the side of the US and further escalated the situation as if that would lead to peaceful results. Europeans tolerated the US bringing violent conflict with a nuclear power right to their doorstep. In this day and age.

Ultimately this whole thing seems to only work out for the US. Russia gains no benefits from this whole sitaution. Neither does Europe. Neither does Ukraine. Only the US gains an excuse to bring more military into Europe while heavily damaging trade relations between two amazing trade partners (EU and Russia).

L'amica, a te sconosciuta, della tua fidanzata ti invita al suo compleanno in pizzeria.  
Tu, fidanzato provetto dai co*lioni d'acciaio, accetti ~~perché obbligato~~ con felicità di passare il tuo sabato sera a festeggiare un compleanno di cui non te ne importa una mazza...ma ben presto scopri che:  

* la pizzeria scelta dalla festeggiata era quella a 2km da casa sua e....25km da casa del 90% dei festeggiati  
* pizze da 7-8 euro a listino, molto particolari logicamente....non ci facciamo mancare niente neh?  
* La festeggiata si presenta con una bottiglia di prosecco e un dolce fatto in casa dalla suocera.  
* arriva il momento del conto, la festeggiata va per prima e con stupore generale paga solamente la sua pizza e la sua bibita... Ma come? Mi son fatto 25km per venire in questa pizzeria che hai scelto tu, dove costa tutto un rene e mezzo, dove avevi promesso che ci pagavi almeno da bere e....ci lasci il conto con coperto incluso? RAGE TIME  
* pago in silenzio e assisto subito dopo alla consegna del nostro regalo che, grazie al cielo, abbiamo preso spendendo 5 euro a testa.  Ma non è finita...  
* la festeggiata ha voglia di far festa e propone di andare in un ""famoso locale a 15km di sua conoscenza"", accettiamo illusi che ""magari non voleva offrire qui ma ci offrirà ettolitri di cocktails in questo famoso locale"".  
* prendiamo la macchina e 15km dopo (logicamente non in direzione verso casa) arriviamo a questo fantasmagorico locale situato in una zona industriale.  
All'ingresso ci sono dei bodyguard che alla vista del gruppo guidato dalla festeggiata le chiedono ""scusi signorina, siete qui per un compleanno? Avete già pagato un tavolo per caso?"" lei in velocità e sottovoce risponde ""no, non ho prenotato niente grazie"".  
Guardo la mia compagna con espressione WTF e ben presto mi ritrovo spinto dentro con una drink card in mano che tutti si apprestano inebetiti a riporre nel portafoglio senza prestare particolare attenzione.  
Io, preso da un attacco di panico, avvicino la drink card alla torcia del cellulare e leggo: ""uscita previo pagamento di 15 euro alla cassa, minima consumazione 6 euro""....mi parte un embolo, cade un cristo e alla fine convinco la fidanzata a filarcela senza pagare prima che sia troppo tardi...  

Conclusione? Il giorno dopo arriva un sms della festeggiata: ""spero che vi siate divertiti ieri e mi dispiace che non siete riusciti a rimanere anche nel locale xxx, ci siamo tanti divertiti....""  

**STRONZA**

Bin ça, c'est justement pas de la prostitution. Dès lors que c'est un métier et une source de revenu, on ne peut plus faire la fine bouche ! 

On ne va pas accepter n'importe quoi, mais on accepte beaucoup plus que ce qu'on le ferait par pur plaisir. C'est somme toute pareil dans n'importe quel boulot. Je pense que nous avons tous des clients/collègue pénibles avec qui il faut bien rester poli pour faire tourner la boutique. Mais bon... c'est déjà pénible de les avoir au téléphone ou en réunion, donc j'imagine ce que ça doit être de les avoir physiquement dans un de ses orifices naturels. Une chose que j'ai lu dans les témoignages de prostituées, c'est qu'une grosse partie de leur clientèle essaie de les humilier autant qu'ils le peuvent, c'est plus rare dans la plupart des contextes professionnels. 

&gt;Je ne suis pas capable de prendre ton raisonnement au sérieux. C'est &gt;du même acabit que ""si t'étais ta fille qu'on tuait tu serais pour la &gt;peine de mort sans procès"". Bah oui peut-être, mais ce n'est pas à &gt;l'affect individuel que le fonctionnement global de la société doit &gt;tourner. Je ne veux pas non plus que ma fille soit ouvrière pour une &gt;boîte qui produit des circuits imprimés à Taiwan, ça ne retire rien à la &gt;valeur de ceux et celles qui le font.

Il y a une grosse différence entre un meurtre qui est définitif, n'implique pas le choix (plus ou moins) volontaire de la victime et est totalement illégal et le fait de faire, d'une façon ou d'une autre, commerce de son corps. L'infériorité sociale des populations exploitées ne se jugent pas sur les valeurs que tu peux avoir mais sur les conditions objectives de leur existence. Ça leur fait une belle jambe de savoir qu'on ne les méprise pas. La question est de savoir ce qu'on met sur la table pour améliorer leurs conditions de vie. La réponse est rien (moi le premier) notamment parce qu'on a pas d'alternative évidente (hormis peut-être le commerce équitable qui bien entendu peut cacher d'autres escroqueries à la bonne volonté). Donc on accepte volontiers leur infériorité, leurs souffrances pour avoir des produits moins chers. 

&gt;Le sexe sans rapport de domination ça n'existe pas. 

Les rapports humains sans domination, ça n'existe pas. Mais alors du coup, les plus forts peuvent légitimement écraser les plus faibles ? C'est dans l'ordre des choses et il n'y a aucune question à se poser là-dessus ?

&gt;Le sexe sans devoir lâcher directement ou indirectement de l'argent &gt;quand t'es un homme hétéro, c'est rare. 

Pour ma part, c'est un critère de sélection. Une femme qui ne m'invite pas à peu près autant que je l'invite, ira voir un autre pigeon que moi. Je pense que l'argent et le luxe sont des zones érogènes chez certaines personnes. Comme je vis avec deux paires de chaussures (dont une qui va avec le costume quand je dois faire bonne figure pour le travail), pas de voiture, je ne suis pas un candidat pour ce genre de femmes.

&gt;Je ne crois pas à la sacralisation du corps ou de l'intime comme &gt;valeurs à défendre, ça me semble très ""sex-negative"", et je crois &gt;encore moins au droit de l'Etat ou de la société à s'immiscer dans mon &gt;lit et mes relations interpersonnelles avec un adulte consentant.

Comment fais-tu la différence entre une prostituée en situation d'esclavage et une prostituée qui se prostitue volontairement ? 

Comment articules-tu consentement et domination. Par définition la domination pèse sur le consentement. Considérer les individus en dehors de relations de pouvoir et de domination est une vue de l'esprit. L'action d'une autorité quelconque reste à mon sens nécessaire parce qu'une portion de la population quand elle livrée à elle-même est foncièrement violente et perverse. 

Pour ma part, le sexe contre de l'argent, ce n'est pas du sexe. C'est vide. Je préfère encore ma main et mon imagination. Quel sens y-a-t-il à se frotter contre quelqu'un dont on se fout, qui se fout de toi ? Une prostituée ou une poupée gonflable possèdent le même potentiel érotique.

Maybe we could have known that he was just waiting for the west to show weakness, but we liked our comfy post-cold-war position too much.

And that's still part of his master plan; that the West deems the probable losses of a direct conflict with Russia higher than the gains of helping Ukraine out. Also, that we're in discord, as usual.

So yes, appeasement has obviously failed. It's clear that the Ukrainian forces cannot withstand a Russian invasion. The US has made clear that they won't send troops. Ukraine has made an official request to the EU for military assistance iirc.

We should honor that request. Under the 'new' thread in the east, we as Europeans should form a European military alliance and send troops to secure Ukraine's borders. Not only would this instantly redefine the EU's position in international politics as an active rather than only passive force. It would establish the EU as a protecting power for former soviet states and tighten their bounds to the west. Also, the military of all EU states combined has a budget of ~220 billion dollar, it would be the second largest military force of the world with the ability to project considerable force to anywhere in the world. 

Our armies are already specialized for their roles in NATO, we'd complement each other pretty well. This also means that Germany has to give up it's anti-militaristic position and finally create a military force that's appropriate for its size and economic power.

Putin will continue to ridicule us while making facts on the ground. He counts on the weakness of the west. A strong move may bring him to reason; of course it could also backfire ans escalate the situation further. My guts tell me a Intervention of a united Europe would make Putin back down if we give him a chance to save face, but then my guts also told me that he wouldn't invade eastern Ukraine, so all I know for sure is that the west has to stop looking so weak, because shit starts to fall apart on all corners.

Despite the shitty decisions of the last two governments, the United States are still our Ally, and - let's face it - the economic crisis (they call it the big recession now) and the two wars in Afghanistan and Irak have weakened the United States, also you can't have Bush going around pissing off pretty much everyone on the planet (even us Allies) and then have a considerate, hesitant President like Obama, unable to clean up the mess. 

It simple. If the United States are weakened, someone else will fill the power vacuum. And who should that be? The Russians? The Chinese? The Islamists?

Bisogna prenotare mesi prima, da secoli voglio andarci ma c'è una coda che neanche in Giappone.

&gt; Milano è bellissima sui Navigli, in vicolo Lavandaie, che se ci capiti alle sette di sera a luglio c'è la luce perfetta per fare fotografie.

Vicolo delle lavandaie spicca perché tutto l'intorno è tragicamente orrendo, saranno 50 metri quadri e le sette di sera a luglio saranno 30 ore l'anno.

&gt; Milano è bellissima al Parco delle due Basiliche e in porta Ticinese

Ecco, sì, lì sembra quasi di essere in una città normale del Nord Italia. A parte il rumore assordante del traffico in via Molino delle Armi. Per quello dici che sembra un pezzo di Roma?

&gt; Milano è bellissima in via Mercanti

Decente sì. Dici tra il McDonald's e il Burger King, vicino a Piazza Duomo?

This segment makes it sound like the cops are a throwback to the times when sexual assault was an issue that was brushed under the rug and people who claimed they were abused were viewed with suspicion - no mention of race here. Hell, just look at the Jimmy Seville scandal - there were reports of him abusing kids for decades in places like schools and hospitals. In the few decades leading up to his death, journalists would ask him if he ""liked little girls"" as if it were some eccentric celebrity quirk, not a quality that was seriously fucking sick. 

The fact of the matter is, there was a time when people didn't take sexual assault victims - especially female sexual assault victims - seriously. There are still people who are mentally stuck in that time, and Yorkshire isn't exactly known for being the epitome of social progress.

The Kremlin cares, but again not so much about being strong, feared, relevant, etc. But about defendable borders. Good video about that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE6rSljTwdU&amp;list=UUwnKziETDbHJtx78nIkfYug

Napoleon invaded Russia easily. And only winter stopped him. Hitler invaded Russia easily, and they had to move their tank factories behind the Ural mountains, to have enough time to build enough tanks to stop the Germans. 

Think about that. They know Moscow and the core of Russia can be easily overrun. And in fact was in WWII. And the Urals saved them. 

And Napoleon was not the first invader. Teutonic knights, Mongols, etc. All have a clear path to Moscow and the very cultural and economic core of Russia.

So Russia has expanded until it touched natural borders. Ocean and giant mountain ranges. And if they had to expand all the way to end of Asia to find a natural border, fine. 

There is no natural border they can reach in the West. Instead they have a buffer zone. The whole Warsaw pact was a buffer zone. But the that collapsed, and almost everyone joined NATO. And NATO's border touched Russia's border, when Russia was at it lowest point in modern history. The Baltics joining NATO was bad enough. But Ukraine joying NATO? Unacceptable. 

Unfortunately Russia has bigger problems than NATO. Most of all its population is shrinking. The shrinking was delayed recently only thanks to immigration, ethnic Russian leaving former Soviet states and immigrating into Russia. But that's over now. 

And a lot of Russia's distant cities need help from Moscow to exist. An ever shrinking Russian population and economy will not be able to sustain them in the long term. 

And if both the EU and China and India use enough renewable energy to drop the price of oil and natural gas, Russia is deep, deep trouble. 

Beyond their immediate problem of a shrinking population, there's a more long term potential danger. 

The Mongolian empire was not really Mongolian. Genghis Khan's initial unification of all the other nomads was not very hard and not very bloody. 

Their conquest of China was very hard and bloody.  And Genghis was great at diplomacy. And the Chinese states fought each other, and even helped the Mongols conquer their rivals. And after every conquest Genghis took everyone who was skilled, engineers, builders, etc, and made them part of his army.  And if any of those things had not happened, the Mongols would not have been able to conquer all of China. Certainly not the Song.  

But they did happen. And the Mongols did conquer China, slowly, taking on Chinese siege technology, and catapults, and engineers, and builders, and anyone useful from every city they conquered. 

So the Mongol army that conquered the Song and the word was more Chinese than Mongolian. Only it's core of horse archers was Mongolian. 
And that's who conquered Russia and the Middle East. That was China's technology and a lot of her people conquering the world.  The Mongol empire was exactly as Mongolian as Kievan Rus was Swedish, and Russia German under Catherine the Great.  
 
China spent most of its history focused on keeping the horse nomads out. It didn't work every well. The Jin, the second Chinese state Genghis conquered were run by a dynasty started by a Mongolian nomad invasion. And they themselves had replaced a dynasty that was from an even older Mongolian nomad invasion. Understandable that China was so focused on just trying to keep that from happening. 

But that's not a problem for modern China. China has absolutely nothing to worry about from Mongolia today. And China has a lot of people. And it's economy is growing fast. And Siberia has so few people. And so many resources, and so much open space, all just sitting there, right next to China....

Allowing Ukraine to join NATO or allowing the Russian separatists to fail could seriously damage Putin's approval ratings among the masses, to the point where it could be increasingly difficult to stay in power. 

There have also been rumors that there is a divide in the Kremlin between people who want to bring Russia back to a time when Russia was seen as more powerful - back to the USSR - and people who don't. Guess who's winning? 

Also, I don't think they need a logical rationale to do stuff like this. A lot of the Iraq war was propelled by higher ups in US intelligence/military who thought that teaming up with Saddam during the Cold War was a huge mistake and that they ought to remove him from power, even if it meant having to rebuild the country. The Iraq war is comparable to Russia's role in the Ukraine 'crisis' because both are/were instigated by a stupidly idealistic clique of leadership figures in their respective countries.

Ce qui se passe c'est qu'en 2016 il doit y avoir une seconde réunion consacrée à la lutte contre les drogues (ONUDC).
Ils doivent s'orienter vers une nouvelle politique pour lutter contre le trafic et assurer la santé des populations. Entre temps vu que certains pays comme l'Uruguay ou certains états aux USA ont légalisé pour le médical et certains en récréatif, ils pourraient être des observatoires supplémentaires sur la baisse de la consommation lors d'une légalisation.

Déjà dans certains états des US, ils indiquent une baisse de consommation des jeunes avec la légalisation (colorado il me semble, mais l'étude est un peu légère). Le portugal est aussi un bon exemple si je ne dis pas de bêtise (légalisation de toutes les drogues et grosse diminution de morts par overdose).

Le Mexique envisage aussi la légalisation. En Europe beaucoup de pays ont au moins décriminalisé mais le problème reste les réseaux du trafic.
En France, c'est à mon avis le plus gros problème, le changement social qui s'y produirait pourrait être limite dramatique pour certaines régions (il faudrait utiliser les taxes pour sortir les gens de la misère où la vente est la source des revenus des quartiers).

Donc tout ça pour dire, si la réunion de 2016 s'accorde dans une direction pour plus de contrôle et sécurité, il pourrait très bien se passer une légalisation pour plusieurs pays. Je rêve peut-être un peu mais vu la direction des Etats-Unis, avec le recul je pense qu'ils comprendront que l'argent et la santé est plus facilement contrôlable par la légalisation et prévention que le reste.

Dernier point, je pense que la légalisation dans les pays devrait passer par l'accompagnement et la prévention, puis proposer des variétés qui ont un certain taux de CBD. Cela éviterait à un consommateur prédisposé de déclencher des problèmes mentaux puisque le CBD est un antipsychotique et contre les effets que le THC peut avoir sur certaines personnes. Ce serait une solution beaucoup plus sûre pour la population qui consomme ce qu'elle trouve dans la rue et qui n'est pas au courant des problèmes que le cannabis peut amener...

 Tu n'as rien montré du tout.. tu confonds ton interprétation biaisée, excuse moi mais un peu simpliste, avec la réalité des choses. Tout ce qui est dit par la dame et sur le ppt est sourcé, et émane d’études en psychologie et psychologie sociale. Ca n’est pas une opinion qui est donnée, mais un état de fait des connaissances dans ce domaine. Ton fameux post ""jamais réfuté"" (lol) est vraiment très orienté. Par exemple tu y écrits *Il ne s'agit donc absolument pas de ""lutter contre les préjugés et stéréotypes filles-garçons à l'école"", mais bien d'imposer un agenda féministe en le faisant passer pour objectif alors qu'il est terriblement biaisé.* en te basant sur un slide (n°9) qui en fait dit l’inverse : il s’agit effectivement de lutter contre les préjugés et stéréotypes filles-garçons à l'école pour chercher à niveler, à terme,  la hiérarchie entre les sexes. En fait la madame elle dit « blanc » et toi tu affirmes mordicus qu’elle a dit « noir », c’est assez effarant. D’ailleurs le slide en question donne juste une définition du terme ""genre"" selon les inventeurs du concept (des psychologues), et dit juste que ce qu’ils appellent ""genre"" est l’ensemble de règles attribuées aux sexes (biologiques) sur des bases purement non-innées, expliquant, entre autres, la hiérarchie existante entre les sexes (cad en faveur de l’homme salariales, temps de travail, responsabilités.. et en faveur de la femme reussite scolaire et accès aux diplomes) ...  rien de féministe là dedans, et encore moins de misandre. C’est juste un fait… à moins que tu appelles *féminisme* toute initiative visant à modifier le statut de la femme dans la société, tant que cette modification leur bénéficierait, évidement.

&gt; Les inégalités flagrantes sont passées sous silence.

Ah oui .. je me demande bien lesquelles, et si possible qui soient pertinentes dans ce contexte.

&gt; Elle nie les facteurs biologiques. C'est un déni de réalité.

 Tu n'as rien compris c'est affligeant. Elle est pourtant claire la madame à partir de la minute 27 qui te fait tant flipper : Les études en question portent justement sur les origines **non innées** des conséquences sociales de l'appartenance à un sexe biologique. Personne là dedans ne nie le sexe biologique, il se trouve juste que tout n'est pas inné, et que cette étude porte juste sur ça, et cherche à déconstruire ce que l'on a pris pour inné mais qui en fait ne l'est pas, c'est-à-dire essentiellement l’ordre social. Les inégalités d’origine biologiques sont simplement hors sujet : on pourrait discuter biologie moléculaire des heures et des heures aux gosses en classe sans que ça ne fasse jamais avancer le schmilblick.. tu comprends ça j’espère ? Ou alors, tu crois carrément que tout est déterminé à la naissance?  Pourtant rien de biologique n’empêche une femme d’être patron, et rien de biologique n’empêche un mec d’être couturier, or on observe bien plus d’hommes que de femmes patrons, et bien plus de femmes couturières que de mecs couturiers.. donc… je te laisse finir le syllogisme, ça te fera du bien. L’autre aspect est que ce schéma de rôles attribués (et entretenu) aux hommes / femmes alors que rien d’inné ne le justifie est en partie à l'origine de pleins de problèmes tels que violences conjugales, violences tout court, inégalités de salaire, inégalités d'accession sociales etc... (mais j'ai bien peur de comprendre qu’en fait tu t'en cognes de leurs problèmes aux nanas). 

&gt; Tu vois pas comme une différence plus importante que ton ridicule ""150 femmes par an"" ?

 C'est juste abject … mais bon...De multiples raisons, tant biologiques que sociales expliquent la mortalité supérieure chez l’homme que chez la femme (et encore, la différence s’amenuise chaque année), sauf que c’est juste pas le sujet…  
 
&gt; Tu n'as rien. Aucun argument ni aucune source 

Je n’ai besoin de rien : le bon sens suffit  mais si tu y tiens les sources sont données dans le powerpoint et par la madame ; tu devrais sans doute les lire. 

&gt; alors que de mon côté j'ai tout vu et analysé.

T'as surtout rien pigé, MauvaisConseil. Peut être que là tu vises un peu trop haut non ? Tu me fais penser aux scientifiques du dimanche qui viennent gonfler les chercheurs aux fêtes de la science avec leurs histoires d'énergie infinie qu'ils ont gobé sur youtube et qui sortent des énormités en affirmant que c'est eux qui ont raison ...

 Mais bon.. plus sérieusement, ce que je ne comprends pas c'est surtout le ""pourquoi"". Pourquoi les gens comme toi font un tel ramdam pour absolument éviter que ce type d'initiative existe alors qu'au contraire, il faut absolument qu'elles soient tentées ? Quel est ton intérêt exactement? Juste, va faire un tour dans un collège discuter ""genres"" avec des gosses de 12/14 berges ... histoire de réaliser le travail qu'il reste à faire et de revenir dans le monde réel.... à moins que .. à moins que cet état de fait te satisfasse... tu sais, la femme pondeuse, cantonnée à son fourneau et surtout qui ferme sa gueule :  c'est pas un peu pour ça que tu militerais au bout du compte?

true,Toppo,FINL,Finland,"&gt;Legal frameworks are stretched all the time in the face of realpolitik, and you are naive if you don't acknowledge that. Remember WMD?

Yea, what about it? You are naive if you think that realpolitik is a magic word that you can use to back up any claim you make and ignore all the legal frameworks that work against your arguments.

&gt;Do you really need me to list you the corrupt countries near bankruptcy in the EU? Are you for real?

Ukraine is not a part of EU, and will not be in a long time, if ever, so how are the internal things of EU relevant?

&gt;Let me spell it out: the EU offered the trade agreement to Ukraine because it was in NATO's interest, not our own. 

Of course it is the interest of EU to get extra-union states to be sympathetic towards EU and feel EU is for them, even though they aren't a part of EU. Why do you think Nato is interested in Ukraine? To grow it's military influence and reach and to counter other military blocks. In the same way EU is interested in growing it's economic and political influence and countering other economic and political blocks. Having good relations with Ukraine is only natural considering this interest of the EU, and seeing how Russia reacts to it, it is very relevant of EU to have sanctions against Russia. 

&gt;The bits about ""being expected"" to act like a superpower we can ignore - expected by whom? Under which legal framework?

Russia, China, the US and some European countries, it depends on the issue. It's not a legal framework as the term ""superpower"" itself isn't a legally formulated term. But for example the Balkan wars were seen by many as a failure of the EU, even thought it happened outside of the EU. Many saw that EU as a global player had a greater responsibility and should have done more to stop the conflict. This is something that is often expected from superpowers, strong interference outside your borders. Likewise during the COP15 negotiatons in Copenhagen many expected EU to wield greater power along with the US and China, but many saw it as a failure that EU did not wield power like the US and China, as people were expecting the EU to wield power like a superpower. The EU as a superpower has been a serious subject for some time:

I would add some public choice views to this analysis. I believe the reason why a complicated agreement like this is necessary is that politicians on both sides are beholden to parochial, protectionistic interests. In other words, I don't really accept that EU negotiators are in any meaningful way negotiating for Europe's benefit, or that their ""win-set"" is a faithful representation of the ""win-set"" of the EU population (whatever that is anyway).

It was done by a researcher of a public university, not some dodgy company offering, as main service, ""science"" on demand. Your scepticism is appreciated, but misplaced.

Did you actually read the study? Did you find methodological weaknesses or errors? If yes, say so! If no, shut the fuck up. There's ways to dig into those aspects that have no official numbers, and reliably so. Studies are judged by being reviewed, not by the authority that wrote them. That would be, you know, argument to authority, no matter the verdict. But, still:

The Mediendienst Information is a publication directed at journalists by the Rat für Migration, which is a cross-discipline association of scientists. It was founded as a reaction to the CDU still driving a line of ""those guest workers will all go again, Germany is not a country for immigration"", which was completely irresponsible. Xenophobia-induced integration failure. We've seen that a lot.

&gt; The criminal stats already do show that a high number of crimes is done by foreigner. So do the math. 

The maths is: Those are not immigrants. They are *actual* foreigners, not here to stay. The Cosa Nostra does not need to take on German citizenship to wash money here. You don't need to immigrate to traffic meth from Czechia, or do an arms deal with German bike gangs. And so on and so on.

If we exclude Roma-White dating, which is very common, but which might not be viewed as ""interracial in the traditional sense"", it's rare. 

The most common one after that, which has a long history, is between foreign male students, Arab mostly, and some African, and Romanian women. The most famous such mixed child is [Cabral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabral_Ibacka), TV host and blogger. Another one is [Nadine](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-i26VcbBRRhU/T704qbzIBxI/AAAAAAAAAPA/mGIiQZlO-EU/s1600/biografie+nadine+vedete+blog.jpg), also in showbiz.

There are some mixed race kids in my hometown (Hungarian/Black and Romanian/Asian) and I know of a some friends-of-friends who are CentrAfrican/Romanian, SyrianArab/Romanian and Korean/Romanian mix. Also, I had a friend whose sister was maried to a Syrian dude.

While Arab/Romanian marriages are the most widespread, and not really that shocking, I don't think ""interracial marriages"" are that widespread in the grand scheme of things.

**Hairdriers**

* they estimate the number of hairdriers based on ownership rate in france
* they assume that ownership equals 12 minutes of daily use(!)
* so the sketchy ownership rate multiplied by the energy requirement for the dubious *average* use equals total energy, right?

**Smartphones**

They acknowledge the energy efficiency of smartphones will likely improve without regulatory intervention. But then they go and talk about *harvesting energy
from the environment, from e.g. body movements (as implemented in watches), temperature
differences, PV* which is crazy talk since the potential harvested energy is tiny compared to the requirement of a smartphone.

They also suggest regulating to *Allow for easy replacement (without tools) of battery by end-user* which is absolutely a good thing (in your face, Apple, Google) and *Possibilities for updating/replacing the software/ operating system to ensure ongoing security, performance (also energy) and usability; availability of alternative operating systems if manufacturer support has ended (availability of specifications to alternative
operating systems vendors/communities)* which would be really good. Then they go to recommend *Allow for increase of memory (e.g. through Micro-SD-Cards)*, which is reasonable but also  *and other performance critical
components;* - which makes me think they've watched that unrealistic phoneblocks video.

**Kettles**

I think we can relax. They acknowledge that faster heating time is better since less energy is lost in the environment. They talk about reducing the thermal mass, better thermal insulation of the external surfaces, a lower minimum quantity of water (so you don't have to heat up the usual 0.5l just for one mug), and faster cut-off after reaching the boiling temperature.

Telefónica owns the phone lines in Spain. Fifteen years or so ago, a law was passed that said they had to allow other operators to use them to provide competing services. Telefónica complies, but in most areas some of those lines are connected to old (very old) switches, some are noisy due to how they are routed near power stations, etc., and so the quality of any particular line can vary a huge amount. 

Guess which lines Telefónica allocates to their competitors?

Your best bet might be to switch to Movistar if you're stuck with ADSL. In my case I had the modem syncronized at 540Kb with Jazztel's ""up to 20Mb"" service, with constant cuts dropouts. I switched to Movistar and contracted ""up to 10Mb"", the guy came out and said oh, this line is shit, I'm going to switch you to a good one.

The discussion here has lost a lot of quality over the last weeks. The tone has gone from perfectly valid criticism of German leadership (which is fine and which I agree with) to calling insults and suggesting that Germans are busy selling Eastern Europe to Russia, only care for themselves and like eating the living, beating hearts of little kittens. Just like with the sovereign debt crisis. And every little step is ""not enough"", ergo Germoney = evil.

true,MauvaisConseil,YAFrance,France,"&gt;Tout ce qui est dit par la dame et sur le ppt est sourcé, et émane d’études en psychologie et psychologie sociale

C'est surtout réfuté par les statistiques et études médicales.

&gt;Ca n’est pas une opinion qui est donnée, mais un état de fait des connaissances dans ce domaine.

L'état de fait des connaissances scientifiques démontre que les comportements humains sont en partie influencés par des facteurs biologiques, ce que refuse d'accepter le concept de genre.

Le sexe biologique est un élément déterminant de l'identité sexuelle. Le genre tel qu'il est employé par les études proposées dans les ABCD de l'égalité n'inclue pas ce socle biologique dans l'identité et la représentation sexuelle.

&gt;il s’agit effectivement de lutter contre les préjugés et stéréotypes filles-garçons à l'école pour chercher à niveler, à terme, la hiérarchie entre les sexes. 

Cela inclue l'idée que les individus sont neutres et que les sexes sont substituables, comme si le simple fait de nier les représentations sociales liées aux faits biologiques allait compenser ces faits biologiques. Or la plupart des représentations sexuées ont pour fondement des bases physiques et biologiques.

Les stéréotypes que dénonce cette théorie ne peuvent être considérés comme des stéréotypes que si l'on adhère à l'existence d'un concept de genre purement social. À partir du moment où l'on inclue la part de biologique dans les comportements, il ne s'agit plus de stéréotypes, mais bien de comportements statistiquement normaux.

Exemple tiré des ABCD de l'Égalité : [le petit chaperon rouge](http://www.cndp.fr/ABCD-de-l-egalite/fileadmin/user_upload/doc/fichepedagogique_danserlepetitchaperonrouge.pdf). 

Il y est clairement dit qu'il faut pousser les filles à faire le loup et les garçons le petit chaperon rouge… Ce qui va à l'encontre des choix des enfants, et on pourrait même dire de leurs tendances naturelles. Cela ne veut pas dire que le rôle du loup est réservé aux garçons, mais que les garçons vont naturellement avoir tendance à le choisir, et ce sans aucune intervention ou pression sociale.

Ailleurs, il est dit qu'il faut ""casser"" le schéma des garçons au centre de la cour avec un ballon et des filles en plein bavardages sur les bords. Il serait du devoir de l'enseignant de mélanger les enfants, de les pousser à opter pour les mêmes jeux afin de développer les mêmes compétences… À nouveau contre les aptitudes et choix des enfants, qui sont bien souvent le fait de données biologiques. 

La vérité, c'est que dès les premiers jours de la vie, les garçons vont statistiquement privilégier les objets et les activités physiques tandis que les filles vont privilégier les discussions et les activités sociales. Cela n'a rien d'une construction sociale, mais c'est biologique. C'est d'ailleurs démontré scientifiquement (en particulier par les travaux de [Simon Baron Cohen](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Baron-Cohen), mais on a des dizaines d'études du même type.

Cette promotion de l’indifférenciation des sexes, qui est au coeur des ABCD, relève d’un parti pris anthropologique qui ne saurait faire oeuvre de culture commune ni même de concept scientifique.

On lutte contre des stéréotypes qui n'existent pas, avec en prime un bon gros déni de réalité.

&gt;D’ailleurs le slide en question donne juste une définition du terme ""genre"" selon les inventeurs du concept (des psychologues), et dit juste que ce qu’ils appellent ""genre"" est l’ensemble de règles attribuées aux sexes (biologiques) sur des bases purement non-innées

La plupart des représentations sociales des sexes (le genre) ne sont pas uniquement sociales et pas du tout arbitraires. La définition même du genre qui est proposée est scientifiquement fausse, car elle nie tous les aspects représentatifs qui sont biologiques.

&gt;rien de féministe là dedans, et encore moins de misandre

Féministe car cela vise à l’indifférenciation entre les sexes. Misandre car  il fait passer les garçons pour des coupables et les filles comme des victimes.

&gt;Les études en question portent justement sur les origines non innées des conséquences sociales de l'appartenance à un sexe biologique. Personne là dedans ne nie le sexe biologique, il se trouve juste que tout n'est pas inné, et que cette étude porte juste sur ça, et cherche à déconstruire ce que l'on a pris pour inné mais qui en fait ne l'est pas, c'est-à-dire essentiellement l’ordre social.

Il se trouve que le genre a comme socle le biologique. La plupart des différences sociales ont pour origine des différences biologiques.

&gt;Les inégalités d’origine biologiques sont simplement hors sujet : on pourrait discuter biologie moléculaire des heures et des heures aux gosses en classe sans que ça ne fasse jamais avancer le schmilblick.. tu comprends ça j’espère ? 

Les conséquences des inégalités biologiques sont tout simplement niées. C'est pour cela qu'il y a une négation du biologique.

&gt;Ou alors, tu crois carrément que tout est déterminé à la naissance?

Tout n'est pas déterminé à la naissance, mais par exemple la différence de sociabilisation, la propension à travailler seul, l'attrait pour les sujets techniques ou les activités physiques, et le goût de la compétition sont influencés par le biologique. Les caractéristiques biologiques évoluent en fonction de l'environnement et de l'âge, évidemment, mais il y a des évolutions biologiquement propres à chaque sexe.

&gt;rien de biologique n’empêche une femme d’être patron, et rien de biologique n’empêche un mec d’être couturier, or on observe bien plus d’hommes que de femmes patrons, et bien plus de femmes couturières que de mecs couturiers..

Évidemment tu prends des exemples ad-hoc en te focalisant sur les hommes bourgeois et les femmes prolétaires.

Se faire exploiter par un patron ou par une patronne ne change rien. Et si les femmes veulent être patron, il faudrait peut-être qu'elles créent un peu plus d'entreprises. Rien n'empêche les femmes de créer autant d'entreprises que les garçons, il n'y a pas besoin d'ateliers ni de lutte contre les stéréotypes pour cela. 

Par contre, les femmes ont moins tendance à prendre des risques et à aller dans des milieux compétitifs. Ceci pourrait s'expliquer par l'influence de la testostérone et du cortisol, qui sont moins présents chez les femmes dès la naissance, voire même avant. Actuellement il n'y a rien qui prouve que les différences de comportements sont d'origine sociale et non biologiques.

Les patrons représentent une infime minorité de la population privilégiée. Regarde plutôt ce qu'il se passe dans le bas de la société pour chaque sexe : les hommes sont plus souvent sans diplômes, seuls et meurent beaucoup plus tôt.

&gt;L’autre aspect est que ce schéma de rôles attribués (et entretenu) aux hommes / femmes alors que rien d’inné ne le justifie est en partie à l'origine de pleins de problèmes tels que violences conjugales, violences tout court, inégalités de salaire, inégalités d'accession sociales etc

D'une part les rôles ne sont pas attribués. Chacun est aujourd'hui libre de choisir sa voie. Ensuite, il n'est absolument pas démontré que différences constatées sont la conséquence de facteurs uniquement sociaux et non biologiques. Encore une fois, il a été démontré l'importance de la testostérone et du cortisol dans l’agressivité et l'attrait pour la compétition. Je te laisse chercher sur google.

&gt;sauf que c’est juste pas le sujet…

Il n'y a rien qui prouve que les violences conjugales sont la conséquence de stéréotypes sexués. Ton exemple n'a donc rien à voir avec la discussion et est d'ailleurs complètement débile (comme si un mari tuait sa femme pour *la remettre à sa place*).

&gt;Pourquoi les gens comme toi font un tel ramdam pour absolument éviter que ce type d'initiative existe alors qu'au contraire, il faut absolument qu'elles soient tentées ? Quel est ton intérêt exactement?

Il faut absolument protéger les enfants de cette propagande qui repose sur des notions fausses et dangereuses. Ce que vous répétez est faux et n'aboutira à rien. Le cas de la Suède le démontre. C'est du despotisme tel que le prévoyait Tocqueville et il est évidemment nécessaire de lutter contre cela.

&gt;Juste, va faire un tour dans un collège discuter ""genres"" avec des gosses de 12/14 berges ... histoire de réaliser le travail qu'il reste à faire et de revenir dans le monde réel.... 

L'adolescence est un moment où les différences hormonales sont les plus importantes, il n'est absolument pas inquiétant que les comportements soient différenciés.

There's a common external tariff in the EU which is levied against the US.

You don't need near black op secrecy when going into talks for them to succeed.  You don't need to play down the effects of ISDS (which appears in more than TTIP).  You don't have to deal with the concerns that such international trade talks are a known way to circumvent such protests as ACTA, and to slip controversial stuff in as a small part of a bigger trade package.   You don't have to have people worried that their government will have to pay compensation to a pharmaceutical companies if elected governments focus on preemptive medicine and treatment programmes.  You don't have to protect industries or carefully name opt outs, if they're currently already protected.

You don't need any of this.

You could just reduce the Common External Tariff between the EU and the US to zero, and the US to do the same with US-EU import duties.

It is as simple as that.  Or could be.  

The talks as they are held do serve corporate interests.  That's why there is so much focus on lobbyists.   You could, *could*, take the Common External Tariff, typically around 13%, and reduce it through installments over 5 years so as to not cause a shockwave and open up a new market and a whole load more competition.  The US would have to meet EU regulations when selling to them, the EU would have to meet US regulations if wanting to export there.  Synergy could be formed at the WTO, but not a single threat of unwanted or watered down regulations need appear on either side of the Atlantic.

The only reason for keeping the CET is if you want the EU to be protectionist behaving more like a customs union than a free trade area.

Su questo hai ragione, ero convinto del contrario, ma leggendo il PDF istat ufficiale:

disoccupazione sono pertanto esclusi i giovani inattivi, cioè coloro che non sono occupati e non 
cercano lavoro, ad esempio perché impegnati negli studi.

true,AKA_Sotof,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; It's strange that you're the one calling people biased and 'completely blind'when the only thing the rebels can be according to you are conscripts and putin thugs. Are you really so bold as to say no one In the east supports them or Russia?

I never said anything that goes either way here. I said if they were fighting then they merely joined Putin's national mafia.

&gt;Are you really that sure that anyone In the east who doesn't support the EU government in the west of Ukraine is a Putin conscript?

There are surely those who don't wish to fight and are duped by Russian propaganda, yes.

&gt;However unlike you I'm open to the possibility that the people in the east aren't so sure about who to support and that many don't support the kiev/EU government. 

I never told you what I believe on this particular subject. Frankly I will be the first to state that I don't have the numbers and the situation in eastern Ukraine is confusing, and frankly anyone who claims they do have the numbers are trying to deceive you. There are no such current, valid numbers because of the chaos and instability brought by Putin.

It is perfectly probable that the majority in eastern Ukraine wants independence or join Russia, I just don't think violence is the way to resolve this. They should hold a referendum observed by the international community if there is even enough support for that happening.

Sadly Putin has left the rest of Europe without other viable options than military force at this point if they want a safe continent without warmongers and warlords. The only option we have if we are to respect international laws and human rights is to intervene on the side of the Ukrainian government and crush the Russian invasion.

You see the part I don't get about you is that you claim to support a neutral view point, but you don't seem to even entertain the notion that if Putin had never intervened with his thugs, we might have a completely different political landscape where people were supporting eastern Ukraine's right of self-determination instead of condemning Putin's efforts to annex eastern Ukraine by force.

You don't seem to entertain the notion that the vast majority in eastern Ukraine are at this point so tired of Russia's warmongering and rampaging of Putin's thugs that they want to stay as Ukraine or even join the EU/NATO as protection against these kinds of attacks on the peace.

I'm open to all the scenarios because I like to deal with facts, but at the same time there is little I despise more than warmongering and a complete disregard for the truth. Putin has shown that he and his thugs are nothing more than warmongers and that they care nothing for the truth unless it is advantageous to them, and that they will without any conscience abuse the existence of human rights in order to violate them.",0,1409316870,null,0,false,0,ck3p387,t3_2ev5fc,t1_ck3p387,t1_ck3oojd,null,1427299622,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

So like I said in my earlier post, it's both - not just PC. In broader terms, it's incompetence. For instance....

Not mentioning the ethnicity of the perpetrators in official reports shouldn't have prevented the police from apprehending the individuals they *know* are involved, assuming the police aren't absolute morons. Apparently, this is an unwise thing to assume. 

Moreover, being PC in fighting crime means not stopping random brown people on the street and asking them if they've molested any children lately.

And the realpolitik thing is that if we REALLY hurt Russia, they will end up as China's bitch which would be a problem... those two being uneasy with each other at best is quite important, because the combined power could actually be dangerous (probably not, but could).

This is a ridiculous statement. Your ignorance is astounding. Your neglecting to say how you would actually 'hurt' Russia. Or who would be the ones inflicting this hurt.

&gt; Obviously it'd be preferable if Russia simply pacified the situation. Barring the aggressor doing that, them being defeated is the next best option

I even left out this gem as a goodwill gesture.

English is not my first language, but I'm sure that statement is contradictory.  Do you care to explain how on the one hand you want Russia to 'pacify' the situation and on the other you call Russia the 'aggressor'.

Or some more recent data, perhaps: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EthnicRussiansInTheFormerUSSR.png

That's 1994. In the Donetsk People's republic we got this group:
Pink: 20.0%-34.9%. So around 1900 they were a minority. In 1994 they were a minority. Or what times are you talking about when they were one and the same group? How far do you want to go back before you reach a Russian majority to justify that ""Russians are native""? 

My point is, you can find all sorts of ambiguous reasons why Russians are native there. But they are ambiguous and people will always disagree on how far you look back. What we have right now are the current international borders, laws and people. Why not work from there on?

In contrast, every citizen has to pay taxes, no exceptions – fortunately we don't have any tax exempt, royal parasites.

And it's different to a tax in the way the money is used. It's tied to a specific purpose (in this case public broadcasting), and the state doesn't have access to the money. They can't take money out of the broadcasting funds to build a new super highway connecting Frankfurt to Berlin so lobbyists can throw parties for them more often. But they can use taxes for that. That makes a huge difference, and it's the main reason public broadcasters resist converting this fee to taxes. They know that they will have to beg for their money, and you get the idea what would likely happen with programming then? 

Unfortunately, we don't have a way to tie taxes to a specific purpose. But then again, there are good reasons for that, too.

true,dekuscrub,null,null,"The majority of the projected gains from TTIP (or any FTA in the modern times really) don't come from tariff liberalization. Average US tariffs are something like 3% (weighted by trade). If you assume an import demand elasticity of something like 1.5 (high but not unreasonable), you'd expect a 4.5% boost in EU merchandise exports to the US following full implementation. This would be a good thing and might translate into some extremely minor GDP/national welfare gains.

The ""meat"" of the gains comes from the ""behind the border"" barriers to trade, since the tariffs are relatively low. Ecorys released an *extremely* detailed analysis of the extent and impact of non tariff measures and regulatory divergence on US-EU trade back in 2009 (see [here](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2009/december/tradoc_145613.pdf)). These issues effect investment, trade in services, in addition to trade in goods.

A more recent study (by the CEPR), drawing information from the above, estimated that the gains from a comprehensive agreement would outweigh the gains from a tariff only agreement by an order if magnitude.

Edit: I also forgot to mention that setting tariffs to zero actually doesn't avert all need for negotiations since there's still rules of origin to deal with. Let's say TPP happens. Now there's free trade between the US and Japan. Meanwhile, the EU's tariff on US imports goes to zero (but the tariff on Japanese imports is still up). Well without some additional work, now Honda can make a car in Japan, ship it to the US, and then send it to the EU tariff free. Figuring out issues like these is actually among the most strenuous and absurdly complex parts of trade negotiations, and there's really no way to avoid it short of making a TTIP customs union (which is.... Unlikely).",0,1409318487,null,0,1409319733,0,ck3pn5f,t3_2ewgn3,t1_ck3pn5f,t1_ck3orzm,null,1427299363,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

When used as a plea for pity, this [appeal to emotion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_emotion) can constitute a potential logical [fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy), while when used as an appeal for sympathy for weaker members of society, or the [social good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_good) of the long-term health and viability of a society, it can constitute an argument for [social justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice) generally accepted as appropriate [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*].

In the short or medium term they won't. In the long term they want to get control of their local seas (and the straits of Malacca) back.

true,DaturaNet,Lorraine,Lorraine,"&gt; L'état de fait des connaissances scientifiques démontre que les comportements humains sont en partie influencés par des facteurs biologiques, ce que refuse d'accepter le concept de genre.

 C'est faux : pour une obscure raison tu fais un procès d'intention. Le concept de genre s'intéresse aux facteurs non-innés, sans pour autant réfuter explicitement l'origine biologique des différences hommes/femmes, ce qui serait absurde. Personne dans l'intégralité de ces documents ne nie que les hommes ne peuvent pas accoucher ni que les femmes ne peuvent se trimbaler de prostate, ni que certains métiers sont réservés aux hommes, et d'autres aux femmes, et ce pour des raisons biologiques. En fait tu noies le poisson en t'agrippant obstinément sur des aspects qui ne sont pas abordés, puisque hors-sujets, par les études de genre. C'est un peu comme si on reprochait à un lettré de ne pas se baser sur des maths pour faire son boulot. C'est bizarre. 

&gt; Le sexe biologique est un élément déterminant de l'identité sexuelle. Le genre tel qu'il est employé par les études proposées dans les ABCD de l'égalité n'inclue pas ce socle biologique dans l'identité et la représentation sexuelle.

On parle ici de la représentation sociale des genres, notamment du genre féminin, et de ses conséquences dans l'ordre social établi. On parle du fait que beaucoup pensent que des métiers sont réservés aux hommes alors que ça ne l'est pas. On parle du fait qu'à compétences et métier égaux, les femmes gagnent ~20% de moins que les hommes, on parle de la vision qu'ont certains hommes des femmes, et de l'inverse, basée sur des stéréotypes absurdes. Tu es hors sujet, et je pense que tu es volontairement hors sujet .. autrement dit de mauvaise foi. Tu t'arques boute sur les différences biologiques pour nier le fait que hommes et femmes ne sont pas sur un même pied d'égalité et que ces inégalités sont pérennisées par une sorte de moule social que les ABCD ont pour vocation à briser, ou du moins à .. disons atténuer. 

&gt; Tout n'est pas déterminé à la naissance, mais par exemple la différence de sociabilisation, la propension à travailler seul, l'attrait pour les sujets techniques ou les activités physiques, et le goût de la compétition sont influencés par le biologique. Les caractéristiques biologiques évoluent en fonction de l'environnement et de l'âge, évidemment, mais il y a des évolutions biologiquement propres à chaque sexe.

  Dans ton discours tu es juste en train d'affirmer que les femmes ne sont pas faites *à la naissance* pour les métiers techniques, scientifiques ou sportifs. Or la réalité te prouve le contraire puisque (bien que l'évolution soit lente) on trouve de plus en plus de femmes scientifiques, patron ou sportives. Juste imagine l'évolution depuis les années 50. Tu crois que la biologie de la femme ou de l'homme aient eu le temps de changer en 1/2 siècle? Evidemment non: pas la peine de se taper une régression multivariée pour comprendre qu'à biologie égale, ces évolutions s'expliquent par une modification, favorable, du contexte social. 

&gt; Par contre, les femmes ont moins tendance à prendre des risques et à aller dans des milieux compétitifs. Ceci pourrait s'expliquer par l'influence de la testostérone et du cortisol, qui sont moins présents chez les femmes dès la naissance, voire même avant. Actuellement il n'y a rien qui prouve que les différences de comportements sont d'origine sociale et non biologiques.

 Bien sur que si : l'évolution du nombre de femmes à poste de responsabilité n'a cessé d'augmenter et ce justement grâce aux efforts des féministes pour casser le stéréotype associé et la disparition concomitante de réseaux professionnels excluant systématiquement les femmes. A biologie égale, cette évolution prouve par A+B que le contexte social est prépondérant dans cette évolution. Certes, beaucoup d'efforts restent à faire, par exemple via des initiatives type ABCD. 

&gt; La plupart des différences sociales ont pour origine des différences biologiques.

Non. Tu affirmes ça péremptoirement. Je préfère affirmer le contraire. 

&gt; Il n'y a rien qui prouve que les violences conjugales sont la conséquence de stéréotypes sexués. Ton exemple n'a donc rien à voir avec la discussion et est d'ailleurs complètement débile (comme si un mari tuait sa femme pour la remettre à sa place).

 Tu fais un déni de réalité particulièrement morbide. C'est la représentation de la femme chez certains hommes qui est à l'origine de tels phénomènes. La violence conjugale, notamment des hommes envers les femmes n'est pas un processus réciproque, mais totalement univoque ayant pour origine un phénomène de recherche de domination sexiste, auxquels les stéréotypes combattus par l'ABCD de l'égalité sont bien évidement liés. Demande autour de toi au FN, tu y trouveras bien deux ou trois beaufs qui sauront te justifier la nécessité d'une bonne tarte à leur rombière de temps en temps. 

&gt; D'une part les rôles ne sont pas attribués. Chacun est aujourd'hui libre de choisir sa voie.

Sauf que des voies en question ne sont pas prêtes à accueillir des femmes, et hommes sans doute aussi.. problèmes de stéréotypes tu vois. Je te laisse chercher sur google quelques exemples représentatifs. 

&gt; Il faut absolument protéger les enfants de cette propagande qui repose sur des notions fausses et dangereuses. Ce que vous répétez est faux et n'aboutira à rien. Le cas de la Suède le démontre. C'est du despotisme tel que le prévoyait Tocqueville et il est évidemment nécessaire de lutter contre cela.

En fait c'est exactement l'inverse: ton discours, que j'imagine répété ad-nauseum au local FN, est la preuve éclatante de l'absolue nécessité de mettre en place de telles expérimentations. 
Par ailleurs, je pense sincèrement que tu n'en as rien à battre des gosses. Ta démarche s'inscrit dans une volonté, consciente ou pas, de pérenniser un phénomène de domination sexiste de plus en plus mis à mal dans notre société. Je te soupçonne de détester les féministes et de te faire pas mal laver le cerveau par Soral.. j'ai raison non (même si ça me décevrai un peu, j'avoue)? 

&gt; L'adolescence est un moment où les différences hormonales sont les plus importantes, il n'est absolument pas inquiétant que les comportements soient différenciés.

 Tu es parfois d'une touchante naïveté. J'ai trouvé un [article](https://monsieursamovar.wordpress.com/2014/06/22/abc-you-and-me/) qui pourrait t'éclairer à ce sujet. C'est d'un prof, en première ligne tu vois. Je précise que je connais beaucoup d'enseignants et ce discours que tu vas lire je l'ai malheureusement souvent entendu.. mais surtout ne faisons rien : c'est la testostérone. D'ailleurs, jusqu’où va ta propension à utiliser la testostérone pour justifier les comportements masculins.. je me demande? 

&gt; Procès d'intention ridicule et qui ne mérite que mon mépris, comme d'ailleurs la plupart de tes propos. Visiblement, le lavage de cerveau a fonctionné sur toi.

C'était pas sympa je te l'accorde. Excuse moi.. d’ailleurs le EDIT que j'ai supprimé l'était .. euh..encore moins.. bon je t'avoue écrire un peu vite des fois et après coup je me dis que je suis allé un peu trop loin et quelque part ça m'embête. Du coup des fois si c'est pas trop tard j'édite le post. Je n'ai rien contre toi et, même si on a pas encore trouvé, y a peut-être plein de sujets sur lesquels on est d'accord ;). Tu me fais penser à un autre FN avec qui j'avais l'habitude de m'écharper/discuter sur le post.fr avant qu'il ne ferme, un gars dont le pseudo était ""Sapristi"" .. ça te dit rien toi qui m'a l'air d'être un sacré forum warrior ? 

Sinon : (i) si (et seulement si) tu écoute béatement du Soral, tu devrais éviter de parler ""lavage de cerveau"" .. franchement. (ii) note que tu as pris la peine de répondre à la plupart de mes propos, ce qui démontre que tu ne les méprises pas tant que ça... et enfin (iii) ne t'inquiète pas, mon cerveau va très très très bien :)

true,jeanralph,ZBSVUE,U-E,"&gt; Comment fais-tu la différence entre une prostituée en situation d'esclavage et une prostituée qui se prostitue volontairement ?

La même différence qu'entre une mec qui n'a trouvé qu'un travail dangereux et une esclave qui travaille sous la menace permanente de violences et/ou sous la rétention de ses papiers d'identité : c'est certes pas une situation idéale mais le libre-arbitre demeure.

La domination ou l'absence de meilleures alternatives pèse sur le consentement et peut résulter en des situations plus que moyennes (discutables au cas par cas, ne généralisons pas sur le sort des prostituées certaines sont bien plus consentantes que d'autres) mais ça ne l'abolit pas dans son entièreté. Une personne libre de ses mouvements n'est pas prisonnière au même titre qu'un otage retenu de force, ça aurait de graves conséquences de dire le contraire.

&gt; L'action d'une autorité quelconque reste à mon sens nécessaire parce qu'une portion de la population quand elle livrée à elle-même est foncièrement violente et perverse.

En fait on est d'accord sur le principe général de la protection de cette frange de la population qui est très vulnérable. J'ai parlé dans mon post précédent du droit de chacun à négocier ses propres relations entre adultes consentants, mais ça c'est davantage l'idée que je me fais de l'escort de luxe (avec qui je traite en égal puisqu'elle peut me jeter si elle ne veut pas de moi). En ce qui concerne la prostituée de rue, je vais au plus pressé et donc ma priorité va à sa protection comme contrainte pragmatique, par delà toute considération idéologique. 

Et justement, je pense que le meilleur moyen d'assurer sa protection est que l'autorité dont tu parles soit mobilisée pour lutter contre les trafics, assurer leur sécurité dans la rue voire réguler de manière draconienne d'éventuelles maisons de closes plutot que pour leur faire la chasse. J'ai lu certains articles qui disent clairement que ""l'abolition"" de la prostitution ne fait que précariser davantage ces femmes (et en plus des abus qu'elles peuvent subir de la part de leurs clients s'ajoutent un éventuel harcèlement policier contre lequel elles deviennent désarmées).

 Après c'est un débat empirique dont on peut discuter des tenants et des aboutissants, mais je sais que des associations de prostituées dont la volonté de protéger cette population n'est pas discutable vont dans mon sens, davantage que dans celui de la prohibition.

---

&gt;

&gt;This is a list of countries by __guns per capita__ (number of privately owned small firearms divided by number of residents).    

&gt;Despite concerns that it contains systematic errors, the *[Small Arms Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Arms_Survey) 2007*,  provides an estimate of the total number of known civilian-owned guns in a country per 100 people of that country.

&gt;As some people may possess multiple firearms and in many countries such as Israel and Switzerland people may possess the guns for decades while the government technically owns the guns, this number does not necessarily represent the percentage of people who possess guns in each country.  Indeed, the errors in these numbers alter cross-country comparisons.

dove h è l'altezza dell'ipotetico banano, d è la distanza dell'isola più distante dal centro dal banano (100 * sqrt(2), circa 140km) e R è il raggio della Terra.

L'ipotetico banano dovrebbe quindi essere alto oltre un chilometro e mezzo; circa 400 volte l'altezza di un banano Lacatan, tra i più alti esistenti.

Senza contare che non sempre potrebbe esserci linea di vista, che nel centro dell'arcipelago c'è l'Oceano Atlantico e dunque il banano andrebbe posto da qualche altra parte, aumentando il valore di d, senza contare la difficoltà dello sviluppo di una tecnologia alternativa a quella GSM, ma compatibile, visto che una torre GSM ha come range tipico 35 chilometri, a causa di limitazioni tecniche.

There wasn't a problem. Without Russian soldiers there wouldn't have been an uprising. Surely they can get some kind of autonomy, that's reasonable.

I also don't agree with the notion to label every critic of TTIP as a person acting based on ""misconceptions and outright paranoia"". It's as good, bad or helpful as calling every pro sayer a shill. *Not* the level of argumentation I'm interested in.

_________________

Lets look at the more reasonable wording:

Good point on the need to **ratify** given outcomes of the processes commonly referred to as negotiations.

&gt; Once final agreement has been reached in the negotiations, it does not immediately go into force. Rather, it has to also be ratified meaning that it has to be put into the official body of law.

First, you might want to expand on how one is able to alter *final* agreements (=your wording). 

To help, the ratification ""translates"" pre-set values into laws and renders them legally binding. It is not a process where those given values are facing a review. That's the part taking place in the phase before, the negotiations.

This might explain why this phase is the, currently, over-protected one and also the element facing the impact in regard to [lobbyists](http://corporateeurope.org/international-trade/2014/07/who-lobbies-most-ttip). Those lobbyists don't play a role in the later ratification because the contents are already set. Q.e.d.

Your **ISDS** claims are based on two (the third is indirect) elements:

1) ISDS cases are rare

2) the ""government in bad faith"" thinking

*3) I'll add this third point because I think it might get lost otherwise*: The ""need"" for protection *outside* the scope of the already established and working elements being available for every citizen.

Answers:

1) The rare character trait is subjectively confirmed but that's a relative statement and does for example not take into account the actual amount of money involved. There also is a threatening nature of ISDS being in place, namely that a government avoids decisions and rulings just because it has to fear that it will get sued by the companies being affected.

So, yes, ""rare"", but the focus on having this element in a ""free trade"" agreement is strikingly interesting. Especially when...

2) Picking an example from another treaty incorporating ISDS: When Australia decides to protect its citizens form the influence of the tobacco industry (while, of course, still allowing them to sell their goods), there's no bad faith involved. Still, Australia gets sued by Philip Morris.

I don't see how the presence of a single case like that is able to support the ISDS aims. If you want protection, please receive it the same way the ordinary citizen does. 

Needless to say that the a vague ""bad faith"" basis could render e.g. environmental protection (=in good faith, for the population = actual people) a possible element of lawsuits. The risk on investing into a legal loophole should rest on the shoulders of the investor, not the country later trying to close this very gap or enhancing living standards for current and future generations.

3) That indirect point:

If one promotes an elevated need for protection for companies only, the #2 example sheds a bad light on that, maybe, reasonable approach. It's not like the EU lacks appropriate courts and standards to receive protection btw. ISDS is for companies only, in separate courts, with separate conditions. The relevant question is: Why?

______________

Adding a point being left out when it comes to **misconceptions:**

The very optimistic notion of believing in key phrases like ""more jobs"" or even ""fair conditions"", usually being accompanied by the belief that wages will increase and/or low-pay sectors vanish. Looking at for example long-standing (and, in some sense, successful) treaties like [NAFTA](http://www.cfr.org/trade/naftas-economic-impact/p15790), none of these came true while the trade volume indeed increased.

The picture of the pros and especially the ones affecting the average person isn't as clear as one might assume after for example hearing the EU Trade Com. making unfounded claims about ""hundreds of thousands new jobs."" In fact, there's [no basis](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2e9796/wheres_the_outrage_over_the_transatlantic_trade/cjxex81) he has to make such claims. He just believes.

Even the [commonly linked studies](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/march/tradoc_150737.pdf) which aim to show how much every participant has to gain from TTIP don't include the impact on jobs numbers or payment nor a single line on ISDS or any other legal concerns. Left out factors. Side note, the studies actually mentioning job numbers also list possible losses. I wonder if the Com. has read them.

The above, adding to the secrecy and the participation of (please excuse the term) [big business](http://corporateeurope.org/international-trade/2014/07/who-lobbies-most-ttip) in the lineup of lobbyists, might add to the impression TTIP currently makes. Certainly room for improvements. :-)

true,MauvaisConseil,YAFrance,France,"&gt; L'histoire des différentes nations Européenne a démarré avant Napoléon et le principe d'état Nation n'est pas apparu de toute manière avant la renaissance.

L'Allemagne ou l'Italie n'existaient pas. C'est un fait. Les trajectoires des différents pays européens sont différentes et tenter de faire une histoire commune est voué à l'échec.

&gt;Et la France a eut des rapports avec a peu pret toutes les nations d'Europe pendant et apres la Renaissance de part sa position géographique et de pouvoir.

Effectivement, la France a été en guerre contre toutes les nations européennes.

&gt;Quel rapport avec étudier l'histoire de l'Europe ou non? Que tu le veuille ou non il y a pas mal de trucs a étudier en histoire pas que la France. Ton blabla sur les nations n'apporte par ailleurs aucun argument. Etudier une chose ou une autre en soi n'est pas mieux ou pas ou idéologique ou pas

Je parle de rappeler que la France a une histoire glorieuse. Ce qui n'est pas le cas des autres pays européen :

*Peut-être parce que ça fait 40 ans qu'on nous répète que la France est trop petite, trop ceci, pas assez cela, qu'on n'arrivera à rien tous seuls.
Peut-être parce que ça fait 40 ans qu'on monte les Français les uns contre les autres, pour les affaiblir afin d'éviter qu'ils soient unis.
Peut-être parce que ça fait 40 ans qu'on apprend la culpabilisation de la France dans l'histoire, au lieu de rappeler son histoire glorieuse. Ce que Hubert Védrine appelle la maladie expiatoire d’autoculpabilisation*

&gt;Rien dans les programmes n'indique que c'est ca le but de la maneuvre.

http://eduscol.education.fr/pid23139/europe-et-monde.html

Le système éducatif se conçoit désormais dans un contexte européen et international en mouvement. **L'objectif est de former des citoyens du monde**, de faciliter la poursuite d'études dans un autre pays, de permettre une recherche d'emploi sur un marché du travail élargi.

Tout est dit. On ne forme plus des citoyens français, mais bien autre chose.

Sur le propos général, je ne fais que reprendre [les conclusions du Haut Conseil à l'Intégration](http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/var/storage/rapports-publics/114000053/0000.pdf) :

La vision du monde qui semble s'opérer est binaire : d'un côté, les opprimés, victimes de l'impérialisme des Occidentaux, et ce, depuis les temps les plus reculés, et de l'autre, les oppresseurs, les Européens et Américains blancs, pilleurs des pays du Tiers-Monde. Cette vision fantasmée sert d'explication à l'histoire du monde et de justification aux échecs personnels.  [...]  

Sur certains territoires, ce vague héritage du tiers-mondisme trouve parfois des échos au sein même du corps enseignant, quelques uns de ses membres confortant les élèves dans un statut de victime, d'autant plus quand ils sont habitants des quartiers. Cette vision de l'histoire peut parfois servir de justification aux rapports sociaux : les habitants des cités, souvent immigrés, seraient les opprimés d'hier, concentrés dans des ghettos, rejetés de la vie économique et de la réussite, tandis qu'au-dehors, les Français, assimilés aux Blancs, se partageraient les richesses. Le sentiment de ne pas appartenir à la communauté nationale est partagé : chacun se définit par la nationalité d'origine de ses parents avant de se sentir Français.

Voir plus loin la recommandation du HCI : 

**L’objectif de tous les Français doit être de vivre dans une société unie dans ses différences  par les principes républicains que l'histoire nationale a construit, dans une même communauté de destin.**

&gt;Tu insulte l'ensemble des professeurs d'histoire si tu insinue qu'ils vont faire autre chose qu'enseigner l'histoire. C'est aussi pas mal de la mauvaise foi.

Il se trouve que j'en connais des profs d'histoire, et ils sont autant affligés que moi du manque cruel de connaissances de leurs élèves. Aucune chance qu'ils ne comprennent une histoire européenne s'ils ne connaissent pas les fondamentaux nationaux.

&gt;Je suis content que tu sois d'accord avec moi et que tu admette t'etre trompé?

Content de voir que tu ne sais pas lire. Je n'ai pas parlé de libéralisme économique mais bien du courant libéral. Apprends à lire petit troll.

&gt;C'est devenu un modèle comme indiqué dans le programme, qui a enclenché pas mal de réformes dans toute l'Europe. Tu devrais en être fier.

Justement, le programme n'indique absolument pas que c'est un modèle, ni que l'ensemble de l'Europe a lutté contre la France à cette époque, il dit au contraire que c'était la France qui menait ces guerres, alors qu'elle était agressée. Il en parle comme si la Révolution française était due à un mouvement européen, avec évidemment pour modèle le parlementarisme britannique. Historiquement, c'est faux.

&gt;Ensuite le fait que l'Italie et l'Allemagne n'existait pas en temps que cette dénomination ne donne aucun argument et d'autre part montre bien que tu ignore que l'ensemble des courants nationalistes datent de cette époque. Le sentiment d'appartenir a un peuple Allemand (Prussien), Italien ou autre se retrouve dans les mouvements pan-germans, pan-italiens du XIXe

Et ? Ça n'a aucun rapport avec ce que je disais. D'autre part rien ne te permet d'affirmer que j'ignore quoi que ce soit.

&gt;Non simplement il s'agit d'étudier les faits et non pas de dire ""c'est la france qu'est la meilleure"" ou la moins bonne. Là tu sors du contexte de l'étude de l'histoire.

Il s'agit de nier la spécificité et la grandeur de la France.

&gt;Si tu avais lu les programmes ils demandent d'insister sur 1830 et 1848

Dans le cadre européen uniquement.

&gt;Tu n'en sais rien. Tu interpretes

Ce sont les conclusions du Haut Conseil à l'Intégration.

&gt;Dans son contexte l'affaire Dreyfus a une importance car de 1 elle impliquait la politique internationale et de 2 c'est une affaire qui montre la tension entre la Prusse et la France, ainsi que le climat de la fin du 19e.

Pas plus que n'importe quel roman à succès de l'époque. Autant étudier Maurras dans ce cas. Son influence est encore présente dans nos institutions actuelles. On ne peut pas en dire autant de Dreyfus.

&gt;Ce n'est bien évidemment pas ce qui est décrit ou demandé dans le programme

Encore une fois, ce sont les conclusions du HCI.

&gt;Ils sont sensés étudiés typiquement ce genre de choses. Reli le programme.

Où ça ?

&gt;Tu est ignorant. Ignorant de l'histoire, de ma capacité, de ce qui est enseigné de comment c'est enseigné, de mes études de tout. Et comme tout ignorant tu fais des raccourcis et penses avoir raison. Tu prends en plus comme exemple un fais raconté.

J'ai déjà débattu avec toi et je sais bien que tu n'as pas les connaissances. Ne serait-ce que par ton orthographe on voit bien que tu as des difficultés à appréhender les nuances et la rigueur académiques. Le lavage de cerveau a visiblement bien fonctionné sur toi, tu ne fais que répéter la doxa sans esprit critique.

&gt;Tu te rends compte que c'est un procès d'intention basé sur une formulation extrêmement mineure? Encore une fois le programme ne dis pas ""Accessoirement' par ailleurs.

Il n'y a pas que la formulation. Les phrases concernant l'affaire Dreyfus sont en gras, on lui attribue le qualificatif ""d'événement essentiel dans la postérité de l’idée de République.""

Bref, il suffit de comparer.

&gt;Procès d'intention il n'est cité nulle part dans le programme

http://cache.media.eduscol.education.fr/file/lycee/12/3/01_RESS_LYC_HIST_TermS_th1_309123.pdf

&gt;Ils en parlent bien?

Ils en parlent sous le prisme du libéralisme et en aucun cas avec des faits historiques.

Ils ne parlent pas des guerres menées par l'Europe contre la France.

Napoléon n'est plus évoqué. [Il avait déjà été viré des programmes de collège tout comme Louis XIV](http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2011/08/27/01016-20110827ARTFIG00002-ce-que-nos-enfants-n-apprennent-plus-au-college.php). Clémenceau a disparu aussi. Lénine n'a même pas existé.

&gt;Your claim works when describing the UN. (With a few major flaws in the system.) It does not work when describing the Security Council.

The UN is closer to the ideal of giving everyone a voice in the choir. But the very reason the Security council exists is because the UN's  predecessor, the League of Nations, didn't recognize the real, factual power of the big shots... and was mostly ignored as a result.

There are obviously a lot of things wrong with the security council.

This is done through the intelligence services, Putin doesn't go on TV and announce withdrawal (note how he didn't announce the start of the insurgency in that way either). Given Putin's hold on the media, it is easy to make proper public noises about the de-escalation and make the public percieve it as victory... he did annex Crimea, after all, that's one clear and big gain for Russia.

You are correct, though, that a war can get out of hand locally and can no longer be turned off easily once it reaches a certain intensity. However, without material support and training from Russia, rebels would not last too long. Once they have amassed sufficient weapons/ammunition/territory, the role of local warlords (with an interest in keeping the war rolling) becomes stronger, they have many options, including drawing Russia in deeper than it would prefer to go. 

That's where the biggest dangers of a muddled civil war lie, Putin may still be in control now, but his hand could be forced by unpredictable future events.

- sourate 16, verset 61 : ""Si Allah s'en prenait aux gens pour leurs méfaits, Il ne laisserait sur cette terre aucun être vivant. Mais Il les renvoie jusqu'à un terme fixé. Puis, quand leur terme vient, ils ne peuvent ni le retarder d'une heure ni l'avancer.""

- Sourate 29, verset 5 : ""Celui qui espère rencontrer Allah, le terme fixé par Allah va certainement venir. Et c'est Lui l'Audient, l'Omniscient. (6) Et quiconque lutte, ne lutte que pour lui-même, car Allah peut Se passer de tout l'univers. ""

&gt;___I Am Cuba___ ([Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language): ___Soy Cuba___; [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language): __Я Куба__, *Ya Kuba)* is a [1964](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_in_film) [Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union)-[Cuban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba) film directed by [Mikhail Kalatozov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Kalatozov) at [Mosfilm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosfilm). The film was not received well by either the Russian or Cuban public  and was almost completely forgotten until it was re-discovered by filmmakers in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) thirty years later.  The acrobatic [tracking shots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_shot) and idiosyncratic [mise en scene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_scene) prompted [Hollywood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood) directors like [Martin Scorsese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese) to begin a campaign to restore the film in the early 1990s.

Besides us there a lot of people in Europe who openly support Russia or the Ukraine, and taking a stand might destabilize your local government. Even if we always criticise our politicians, the diplomats know their stuff and Im sure that there are a lot of underhand deals being made. What do you want them to do? Openly antagonize Russia? Please. 

2. Nobody will invade anybody. The time of open war is over, nobody can afford that anymore. If we like it or not, the people of Crimea, and partly of eastern Ukraine -want- to be part of Russia. If you invade and force them to comply, you are putting them in a situation where they might rebel. As they do right now, as we see. Why would they abide to our rules if they dont want? They will be in the sam situation as your russian-invaded Ukraine: there is an enemy force (EU) who occupies your land and forces you to do as they please.

3. It doesnt really matter what they think. If they do stupid stuff to harm their country, they are traitors and should be put to justice. Acting like a spoiled child and destroying property just because is senseless.

4. Agree with you here. There are still too many nations with too many interests, I too want the EU to have a strong standpoint. They arent chicken, they have no direction, at least not openly.

In other words, if you tend to trust people and have lots of face-to-face interactions, you will probably assess your well-being more highly.

&gt;But of course interactions on online social networks are not face-to-face and this may impact the trust you have in people online. It is this loss of trust that can then affect subjective well-being rather than the online interaction itself.

Quand j'étais petit, vers 13 ans, je détestais les français avec chaque partie de mon corps et mon âme. Pourquoi? Je n'ai aucune idée. J'étais un ado nationaliste qui pensais que les Etats-Unis étaient incroyables. J'avais une vision des français dans ma tête comme les personnages sur les dessins animés que je regardais à la télévision; un homme portant une chemise noire et blanche, avec une cigarette à une main, une baguette à l'autre, en s'asseyant dans un café devant le Tour Eiffel. Je pensais que chaque français était comme un parisien impoli, je pensais que chaque français détestait les Etats-Unis, et finalement je pensais que chaque français était une pimbêche. 

Alors, la question importante, pourquoi est-ce que je pensais ça? La réponse est vraiment simple. C'est un temps passé de se plaindre des français dans le média américain. ""Les français ne sont pas en Irak avec nous, les français ne sont pas du même avis comme nous, les français sont socialistes qui veulent que les homosexuels se marient."" Et puis dans la classe d'histoire, ""Les américains puissants libérèrent les français deux fois des mains viles des allemands."" Et un étudiant dit ""Hahaha, les français, ils sont faibles, ils mangeaient probablement les grenouilles pendant que nous libérions leur pays"". On ne peut pas s'échapper de ce sentiment. Et puis, puisque personne ne connait un français réel, le sentiment reste.

Si on ne veut pas s'informer (et il n'y a pas une culture d'éducation ici), on va continuer penser tous ça, et croit qu'il est la vérité. Alors, si nous retournons à l'article d'OP, on peut voir pourquoi cet homme croit qu'un de six français soutiennent ISIS.

Elargissons un tout petit peu aux versets adjacents:

&gt;16:60: C'est à ceux qui ne croient pas en l'au-delà que revient le mauvais qualificatif (qu'ils ont attribué à Allah). Tandis qu'à Allah [Seul] est le qualificatif suprême. Et c'est Lui le Tout Puissant, le Sage.

&gt; 16, 62: Et ils assignent à Allah ce qu'ils détestent [pour eux-mêmes]. Et leurs langues profèrent un mensonge quand ils disent que la plus belle récompense leur sera réservée. C'est le Feu, sans nul doute, qui leur sera réservé et ils y seront envoyés, les premiers.

Hoppla, deux versets qui condamnent à l'enfer ceux qui n'y croient pas. Aucune compassion, mais de l'intolérance. 

&gt;39, 3 :C'est à Allah qu'appartient la religion pure. Tandis que ceux qui prennent des protecteurs en dehors de Lui (disent) : « Nous ne les adorons que pour qu'ils nous rapprochent davantage d'Allah. » En vérité, Allah jugera parmi eux sur ce en quoi ils divergent. Allah ne guide pas celui qui est menteur et grand ingrat.

Condamnation de ceux qui ""prennent des protecteurs en dehors de lui"", c'est à dire les infidèles et ceux qui vénèrent d'autres dieux en plus de Allah. Un point de plus pour moi. 

&gt;39, 5 :Il a créé les cieux et la terre en toute vérité. Il enroule la nuit sur le jour et enroule le jour sur la nuit, et Il a assujetti le soleil et la lune à poursuivre chacun sa course pour un terme fixé. C'est bien Lui le Puissant, le Grand Pardonneur ! 

Allah est tout-puissant, on s'en tape, ça compte pour rien.


&gt;29, 4: Ou bien ceux qui commettent des méfaits, comptent-ils pouvoir Nous échapper ? Comme leur jugement est mauvais ! 


Allah sait tout, il punira ceux qui commettent des méfaits. Bon, ni miséricordieux, ni affreux. Zéro.

&gt;29, 7: Et quant à ceux qui croient et font de bonnes œuvres, Nous leur effacerons leurs méfaits, et Nous les rétribuerons de la meilleure récompense pour ce qu'ils auront accompli.

Bon, allez, un point pour toi. Bien que trois versets plus haut, il vient de dire que ceux qui commettent les méfaits ne peuvent lui échapper. Mais là ""croire"" et quelques bonnes oeuvres et il oublie. Comme son jugement est mauvais! hehe

Much of the large landmasses of the Nordics aren't particularly useful either; either being mountainous or dense forest. Population density maps show this nicely: http://i.imgur.com/FnfVuLG.jpg. So while there's a lot of land, most of it can really be discounted for any comparisons to other European countries.

And the Nordics are taking in a huge number of immigrants, yet our social systems are still holding up. Ethnic/cultural homogeneity really isn't the real issue/solution. Distribution of wealth and social capital is. In the US this is of course heavily tied to race due to historical reasons, and in Europe to some extent due to a lot of immigrants being refugees, and thus necessarily poor, but ethnic/cultural homogeneity in my opinion has virtually nothing to do with the success of the Nordic Model; economic homogeneity is the real route to success.",0,1409326368,null,0,false,0,ck3t5ky,t3_2ewp1o,t1_ck3t5ky,t1_ck3ssku,null,1427297654,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

He also states that Greece tried to establish a client relationship by offering a Greek origin paper. The term he used (πελατειακή βάση) basically means that the government does you a favour and in return you vote accordingly. So the Greek state offered Greek papers to Albanians so that they would in exchange vote for those who helped them, and specifically the Greek party in Albania. That of course backfired spectacularly because those who left Albania for Greece had no intention of returning just to vote.   
You could get Greek papers by either money (plain old corruption no surprise there), or by an oral test in the Vlach language with a known speaker of that language, the so called ""Vlachmeter"". They also used another retarded way of calculating the minority by giving Greek status to anyone who was Orthodox christian.

&gt;RUSSIA’S import ban on Polish fruit and vegetables will leave Poland with a big surplus of apples by the end of the year. Last year 677,000 tonnes of Polish apples went to Russia, accounting for 56% of Poland’s apple exports.  This year Poland was able to export its apples to Russia only until August 1st, when Russia imposed an import ban.

&gt;Poles have responded by celebrating the forbidden fruit, encouraging people via a social-media campaign on Facebook and YouTube (pictured) to “Eat apples to annoy Putin”. Intermarché, a chain of supermarkets, is planning to send 40 tonnes of apples to Kaliningrad, the Russia enclave that shares a border with Poland, drawing humorous comparisons with Russia’s recent “humanitarian convoy” to eastern Ukraine.

&gt;From Tallinn to Warsaw, Moscow’s latest trade sanctions arouse strong emotions. Russia is “a totally untrustworthy and unpredictable business partner,” said Dalia Grybauskaitė, Lithuania's president, on August 8th, the day after Russia imposed a wide-ranging ban on food products from the European Union and other countries. In Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, food producers and politicians expected the ban. But this doesn’t mean they were ready when it was imposed.

&gt;The ban could cost Polish farmers €500m ($659m), according to estimates by Poland’s ministry of agriculture. In the three Baltic States, where food exports to Russia represent a smaller fraction of overall exports, dairy producers will be among the most affected. Road hauliers who drive food to Russia will feel it too. Evaldas Gustas, Lithuania’s minister of the economy, said that the effects of the ban “will not be extensive”, but that it could reduce Lithuania’s GDP growth by 0.2 percentage points if it lasts. Taavi Rõivas, Estonia’s prime minister, pointed out in an interview that ordinary Russian consumers will have to make the biggest sacrifice.

&gt;Not only trade with Russia has been affected: four days after the ban was announced, Pieno Zvaigdzes, Lithuania’s second-largest producer of dairy products, stopped taking deliveries from one of Latvia’s largest milk producer cooperatives, citing force majeure.

&gt;Governments are trying to help. Riga will grant tax holidays to Latvian companies that export more than 10% of their products to Russia, among other measures. Warsaw has been discussing ways to help cider producers, though it has decided to keep the excise tax on the alcoholic beverage. Poland is banking on farmers receiving compensation from Brussels, though Marek Sawicki, a farmer, was not impressed by the European Commission’s offer of €125m. “We’ll keep fighting,” he said. Mr Sawicki is based in Jabłonka, a village in southern Poland whose name comes from the Polish word for apple tree.

&gt;With Russia’s veterinary and phytosanitary services becoming increasingly capricious and arbitrary in their assessments of foreign foods, some producers may have no choice but to try and sell their products elsewhere. Warsaw is trying to convince Washington to open the American market to Polish apples. But America's strict standards for food imports, and the likely opposition of American farmers, mean it could be a long wait.

&gt;Meanwhile, four weeks into the ban, and with the apple season around the corner, Poles don’t appear to be eating more apples. Despite the #jedzjabłka (eat apples) campaign on social media, apple growers and supermarkets say they are selling the same amount as before. To counteract the ban, Poles would have to start eating twice as many apples, doubling their annual consumption to 30kg each.

true,GavinZac,IREL,Ireland,"&gt;You honestly think it is colder in the UK then USA? You realize the waters from Gulf of Mexico feed towards Europe and keep it warmer even if it is farther North? The numbers aren't even remotely close in comparison by large orders of magnitude.

I'm from Ireland, yes. The Gulf Stream is our happy friend who stops us from being Norway and dumps the contents of the Atlantic on our heads from September to April. 

However, I get the feeling you're talking about the North of the US. I proposed to my wife on a rooftop in NYC at night in December so I'm aware it gets cold. It gets cold on special occasions this side of the ocean too. Sometimes that lovely wind lets up and Norway starts feeling a whole lot closer. These cold snaps are what kill people. 

Regardless, the average *highest* daily temperature in the UK over the course if a year is 55 degrees Fahrenheit. That puts it on par with the states on the northern border of the USA. 

http://www.mapsofworld.com/usa/usa-maps/united-states-weather-maps.html. 

That surprises even me, so I found a second source. This one puts the line of equivalence a lite further south, further south when inland at least, but still within a 10 degree (f) range with most of the places cited. 

http://www.allcountries.org/uscensus/408_normal_daily_mean_temperature_selected_cities.html

What you have are more frequent extremes; it is more frequently hot in the summer and more frequently freezing in the winter. You have aircon and massive houses to deal with this. Britain and Ireland might only get hot or cold snaps once a year, but because it's not the norm, it's not financially viable to be completely prepared for. 

&gt; large orders of magnitude 

You don't appear to know what an order of magnitude is, so please don't use the phrase. Apart from how neither Celsius nor Fahrenheit can be properly expressed with orders of magnitude, the idea that it's even ten times - a single ('small'?) order of magnitude - colder in the US is a bit silly.

For me, I don't know. Here, I'll give a short elaboration:

**Yes**

We stand as one! We are a united nation! We are not Polish, Greek or German! We are European! Anyone is equal! Equal pay check, coins, rights and benefits! We are all equal for Lady Justice and we have nothing to fear, but our progress!

**No**

This is utter shit! With a federalisation we lose our identity! Our cultural heritage for which we have fought so long for! We have one government for 750 million people, but they can't decide what French, Portuguese or Dutch people value most!

That comparison doesn't fit. It's not as if the UN has an army on alert 24/7, and then they just have to stay in the barracks because of the UN council. The great powers *always* will approve or disapprove of actions, but this way they're forced to take a position beforehand, so everyone knows what they're getting into and can prepare accordingly, and if there's one power blocking everything they'll get the reputation damage. Removing the Security Council will not make more interventions happen; it will just increase uncertainty, making everything more tense and risky.

&gt;Again, try giving votes in Congress ONLY to New York, California and Texas - and see how that explanation works with the other states.

The UN is not a state and the UN members did not join expecting it to function as a state.

&gt;The reasoning of a dictator.

I'm a historian. This is how it happened. Don't shoot the piano player.

How would *you* force eg. Russia or the USA to adhere to the declarations of the General Assembly of the UN then?

&gt;So France gets a seat on the Security Council but India doesn't? Because it would be inconvenient? Heck, there's no reason why even Canada shouldn't have a seat when France does, but even India doesn't?

Canada is closer to Europe in social standards, and Japan is still seen as small and distant enough that we'll keep the center of gravity close to us.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"I keep seeing people making this comparison, and I'm wondering if they misunderstood what was happening at the time. Back then, it was about the question whether war was inevitable. If another large European war would have to be fought sooner or later, then giving the Nazis more time for rearmament instead of declaring war would be a mistake, but if you judged that was even just a decent a chance that Hitler would at some point be satisfied then declaring war would have meant sending another generation to die in another large war even if it might have been avoided.

Today we know that WWII had become inevitable the day Hitler came to power. The Nazis began preparations immediately, read about Hjalmar Schacht's [trial](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Schacht.html) to learn about the astonishing extend of the preparations. So, in hindsight, it's easy to criticize Chamberlain, essentially for hesitating to start WWII.

Anyway, the comparison doesn't work, because that one year extra time for rearmament made a giant difference for the Nazis, but if an all-out war with Russia is inevitable, then it hardly matters.

Within 40 days of that, you'll get a letter from the NOT (drug offenses) office of the local Prefettura summoning you to a hearing (you can send in documents in your defense at this stage if you want). At the hearing, people from the NOT office will review the case and decide whether to just give you an official warning or slap you with an administrative sentence, which could *theoretically* revoke your visa. For first time offenders found in possession of small amounts the warning is by far the most likely outcome, and doesn't carry any further consequence.

In any case, the fact will stay 'in the system', which means that if they catch you again they'll know it's not the first time. It's not going to be registered as a crime (because it isn't, in Italy) and won't be found on your 'criminal record' or anything of the sort. The records they keep are mostly used to figure out whether people are drug addicts.

Nobody except yourself should be notified at any point; not your university, not your employer and so on.

Edit:

I might've exagurated it a bit with the 'massive scale' thing, but I do believe if the Russian intend was genuine, we'd welcome them with open arms.

Europe is a continent that was, on multiple occasions, absolutely torn apart by war and conflict. The European Union's main goal was to halt these conflicts, bring in peace, and let prosperity flow from this peace. Having the biggest war monger nation of the continent inside this fold makes a lot of sense. No longer would European leaders have to bend over backwards to meet with the Russians. Their political parties would simply have representatives walking around Brussels ready to chat. 

Eastern Europe might say no at first, but I think if they truly consider the effects with regards to likelihood of aggression / war / economic fighting, they'd probably sign on. Doesn't mean they'd like the Russians, it'd just mean they could call them names to their face, in Brussels.

true,amenohana,null,null,"God, I'm not sure why nobody in this thread has answered your question simply...

This is not a dumb question, and there's some subtlety here: it depends on whether the adjective is *attributive* (roughly: coming before a noun), *predicative* (roughly: coming after a noun, describing it via ""to be"", ""to become"", or similar), or actually an *adjectival noun* (roughly: something that stands in for a noun) in disguise.

""Ein Großes"" means ""a big one"". This is a standard thing you can do with an adjective - capitalise it and put an appropriate adjective ending on it, and suddenly it becomes an adjectival *noun* (in English, usually ""a/the ___ one"" or ""some/the ___ ones""). So you can say ""nicht groß"" (""not big"" - adjective), but ""kein Groß**es**"" (""not a big one"" - noun), or ""das Groß**e**"" (""the big one"" - noun), or ""die Groß**en**"" (""the big ones"" - noun).

You'll have noticed all the endings changed, and I haven't told you why. That's mostly because which one you use is a little complex at first sight: it depends on the noun's gender and case and so on, in true German fashion. It's the same one you'd use attributively: ""ein groß**es** Auto"" (note small ""g"" because it's an adjective again now) = ""a big car"". That doesn't make it any clearer, I'm sure, but you can look them up if you want to. :) Point is, attributive adjectives and adjectival nouns take endings, and at some point you'll learn what those endings are. You *can't* say ""ein Groß"" or ""ein groß Auto"".

Likewise, though, you can't say ""das Auto ist großes"": predicative adjectives *never* take endings, so ""das Auto ist groß"".",0,1409334117,null,0,1409334414,0,ck3x7je,t3_2emh01,t1_ck3x7je,t1_ck0vkuj,null,1427295763,1,false,German,t5_2qq51,1

true,MauvaisConseil,YAFrance,France,"&gt; Le concept de genre s'intéresse aux facteurs non-innés, sans pour autant réfuter explicitement l'origine biologique des différences hommes/femmes, ce qui serait absurde.

""le genre est un contenu social **et arbitraire**. Si ça a une part de biologique, [ce n'est pas arbitraire](http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/arbitraire/4951). Là, on dit clairement que les représentations sexuées sont le fait d'un choix, ce qui est faux.

&gt;Personne dans l'intégralité de ces documents ne nie que les hommes ne peuvent pas accoucher ni que les femmes ne peuvent se trimbaler de prostate, ni que certains métiers sont réservés aux hommes, et d'autres aux femmes, et ce pour des raisons biologiques.

Hors-sujet.

&gt;En fait tu noies le poisson en t'agrippant obstinément sur des aspects qui ne sont pas abordés, puisque hors-sujets, par les études de genre.

Si on considère la part biologique, les stéréotypes ne sont plus des stéréotypes mais bien des tendances naturelles. Ce qui invalide l'intégralité des ABCD de l'égalité.

&gt;On parle du fait que beaucoup pensent que des métiers sont réservés aux hommes alors que ça ne l'est pas.

Non. On parle de ""pousser les filles à faire le loup et les garçons le petit chaperon rouge"" et de """"casser"" le schéma des garçons au centre de la cour avec un ballon et des filles en plein bavardages sur les bords"".

On parle de faire croire que les filles sont les victimes et les garçons les privilégiés. Cela n'a rien à voir avec le fait d'encourager les femmes à faire tel ou tel métier.

&gt;Tu t'arques boute sur les différences biologiques pour nier le fait que hommes et femmes ne sont pas sur un même pied d'égalité et que ces inégalités sont pérennisées par une sorte de moule social que les ABCD ont pour vocation à briser, ou du moins à .. disons atténuer.

Je ne nie pas le fait qu'il y a des inégalités. Je nie le fait qu'il y a des injustices. Les inégalités ne sont pas le fait de ""la société"" et encore moins d'une quelconque ""hiérarchie"" que suppose cette idéologie.

&gt;Dans ton discours tu es juste en train d'affirmer que les femmes ne sont pas faites à la naissance pour les métiers techniques, scientifiques ou sportifs.

Tu confonds ""avoir un intérêt pour"" et ""être fait pour"". Et je répète que ces différences ne sont pas données à la naissance, mais résultent en partie d'une constante différence hormonale tout au long de la vie.

&gt;Or la réalité te prouve le contraire puisque (bien que l'évolution soit lente) on trouve de plus en plus de femmes scientifiques, patron ou sportives.

La prémisse est fausse donc ta conclusion (non sourcée) est fausse. J'ai parlé d'intérêt et de tendance. Ce que montrent ces évolutions, c'est qu'on n'a absolument pas besoin de ces ABCD de l'égalité pour faire évoluer la situation. L'égalité est déjà garantie aujourd'hui et les femmes ne sont absolument pas victimes d'un complot pour les empêcher d'avoir telle activité.

&gt;Tu crois que la biologie de la femme ou de l'homme aient eu le temps de changer en 1/2 siècle?

Elle a changé et [c'est d'ailleurs prouvé](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9l%C3%A9tion_de_la_spermatogen%C3%A8se) chez les hommes.

&gt;Evidemment non: pas la peine de se taper une régression multivariée pour comprendre qu'à biologie égale, ces évolutions s'expliquent par une modification, favorable, du contexte social.

On n'en sait rien. Encore une fois, les patrons et les athlètes sont des infimes minorités privilégiées dont je me contrefous. C'est bien un point de vue bourgeois que de se focaliser sur ces minorités pour en sortir une règle générale. Ce qu'on constate, c'est que l'emploi salarié, précaire et le chômage augmentent, et ce pour la majorité. 

Le contexte social a effectivement évolué, mais absolument pas favorablement.

&gt;Bien sur que si : l'évolution du nombre de femmes à poste de responsabilité n'a cessé d'augmenter et ce justement grâce aux efforts des féministes pour casser le stéréotype associé et la disparition concomitante de réseaux professionnels excluant systématiquement les femmes. A biologie égale, cette évolution prouve par A+B que le contexte social est prépondérant dans cette évolution.

Il y a surtout eu une augmentation du chômage, de la précarité, des divorces, et de la solitude qui concernent bien plus de personnes, sans parler de l'échec scolaire. Merci les féministes, puisque tu leur attribues les évolutions sociales. On voit bien l'idéologie bourgeoise dans toute sa splendeur.

Maintenant, que les conditions matérielles aient favorisé une bourgeoisie diplômée plutôt qu'une bourgeoisie de capital, ce faisant avantageant les femmes, puisque le système scolaire leur est favorable,  cela n'est absolument pas surprenant, mais ça n'a rien à voir avec le féminisme.

&gt;Non. Tu affirmes ça péremptoirement. Je préfère affirmer le contraire.

L'attrait pour le social et l'aversion au risque des femmes, l'attrait pour la technique et la compétition des hommes, via les hormones, est prouvé. Cela suffit à expliquer une bonne partie des différences sociales.

&gt;C'est la représentation de la femme chez certains hommes qui est à l'origine de tels phénomènes.

Bien sûr que non : les hommes ont tendance à être plus agressifs que les femmes, les femmes ont tendance à être moins résistantes et musclées que les hommes. Nier l'importance des hormones dans ces comportements est un déni de réalité. Et pour ta gouverne la violence physique touche d'abord les jeunes hommes. [Les victimes d'homicides sont à 78% des hommes](http://homofabulus.com/quel-sexe-tue-le-plus-et-pourquoi-agression-homicide-et-evolution/)... C'est probablement du sexisme aussi...

Au fait, tu parlais de 150 femmes et zéro hommes, [c'est faux](http://www.20minutes.fr/societe/1369317-en-2013-121-femmes-et-25-hommes-sont-morts-sous-les-coups-de-leur-conjoint).

&gt;La violence conjugale, notamment des hommes envers les femmes n'est pas un processus réciproque, mais totalement univoque ayant pour origine un phénomène de recherche de domination sexiste, 

Affirmation péremptoire et auto-explicative. De très nombreuses études tendent à montrer que c'est un processus réciproque :

https://www.csulb.edu/~mfiebert/assault.htm

et

http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/V71-Straus_Thirty-Years-Denying-Evidence-PV_10.pdf

&gt;auxquels les stéréotypes combattus par l'ABCD de l'égalité sont bien évidement liés. 

Trouve moi une seule proposition concrète des ABCD de l'égalité qui, selon toi, permettrait de diminuer la violence conjugale.

&gt;Demande autour de toi au FN, tu y trouveras bien deux ou trois beaufs qui sauront te justifier la nécessité d'une bonne tarte à leur rombière de temps en temps

Chez moi au FN il y a peu de risques. Dans la population immigrée africaine par contre, oui tu risques de trouver ce genre de propos. C'est pas au FN qu'on voile les femmes, qu'on pratique les mariages forcés (ou entre cousins) ou qu'on pratique l'excision.

Petite lecture pour toi :

http://www.mediterraneas.org/IMG/pdf/informe-francia.pdf

&gt;Sauf que des voies en question ne sont pas prêtes à accueillir des femmes, et hommes sans doute aussi.. problèmes de stéréotypes tu vois. 

Prêtes dans quel sens ?

Il n'y a aucune étude scientifique en France sur ce que tu affirmes.

&gt;En fait c'est exactement l'inverse: ton discours, que j'imagine répété ad-nauseum au local FN, est la preuve éclatante de l'absolue nécessité de mettre en place de telles expérimentations.

Aucun argument. Tu dis juste ""mon avis est meilleur et il faut faire ce que je dis"" sans rien prouver.

&gt;Par ailleurs, je pense sincèrement que tu n'en as rien à battre des gosses

Procès d'intention.

&gt;Ta démarche s'inscrit dans une volonté, consciente ou pas, de pérenniser un phénomène de domination sexiste de plus en plus mis à mal dans notre société

Ma démarche s'inscrit dans une volonté consciente, de lutter contre un phénomène de misandrie de plus en plus présent dans notre société. Il n'y a qu'à voir [ces courbes](https://i.imgur.com/YLQXr29.png) pour comprendre ce contre quoi je lutte.

&gt;Je te soupçonne de détester les féministes

J'aime bien les féministes différentialistes pro-sexe comme Despentes. Revaloriser le féminin et prendre acte des différences entre sexes plutôt que de faire croire qu'on peut les effacer en partie par la propagande et le lavage de cerveau des enfants.

Les autres féministes mourront car elles sont dans le déni de réalité.

&gt;Tu es parfois d'une touchante naïveté. J'ai trouvé un article[1] qui pourrait t'éclairer à ce sujet. C'est d'un prof, en première ligne tu vois.

&gt;Je précise que je connais beaucoup d'enseignants et ce discours que tu vas lire je l'ai malheureusement souvent entendu.. mais surtout ne faisons rien : c'est la testostérone.

Je suis d'une famille de prof et d'instits depuis 4 générations... J'ai des amis et de la famille prof dans tous les milieux, tous types d'établissement et de classes, et dans les 4 coins de la France. 

Le fait que l'enseignant ait perdu toute autorité et qu'on fait face à des enfants rois n'a rien à voir avec le sexisme. Il y a des cas sociaux partout, sauf qu'avant on les séparait des autres et on leur faisait bien comprendre qu'ils devaient obéir. 

Maintenant c'est le règne du laxisme et en cela le comportement du prof est révélateur : il se plaint de la société (les parents, l'école, l'État), et est incapable de se faire obéir.

Pas étonnant qu'avec ce [pédagogisme](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A9dagogisme) qu'on arrive à de telles situations. Mais encore une fois, les ABCD ou aucune initiative féministe n'y changeront rien.

Bref, rien à voir avec du sexisme, tout à voir avec l'échec du système éducatif.

Et pas besoin d'ABCD de l'Égalité pour corriger ça, il suffit de montrer ces courbes :

In other words they stood up, with grenades in their hands, maybe that the grenade explodes at a greater height, to be more effective. The Russians were already in range, if it was moments later. There is no indication other than that they held their hands high (but with grenades or sth like this in their hands).

&gt;Even when it comes to more sophisticated technology, the buyers have not been particularly belligerent organisations. Night-vision goggles were sold to students for a college pro­ject, said Number 10, while small shipments of guns went for sporting purposes.

&gt;If anything, the state of UK weapons exports to Russia shows how little Moscow relies on foreign pow­ers for its military prowess.

It does politically. Look at Putin's approval ratings, it's like he's a wartime leader (because he kind of is). I agree with what you're saying, but you have to remember that Russia doesn't really care to be liked by the international community. All they want is to be feared/respected/in control of their global region. Where the west largely governs by likeability, Russia governs by coercion. 
  
It should be pretty clear by now that Russia isn't interested in being liked by the majority of the world, and certainly doesn't care what ""the west"" thinks. I mean, they lost the Cold War and now everyone in the room is gravitating towards the cool, hip, western guys. But nobody likes to admit they lost gracefully and then change themselves to go fit in with the winners who just beat you; so Russia sits in its corner insisting they never needed the west anyways, and how they have their few weird friends (central asia, belarus, eastern ukraine, and the Commonwealth of Independent States) to hang out with.  
  
I totally agree that Putin is a victim of his own manufactured nationalist surge, and we should all realize he's now hostage to his own constituency. There's nothing he fears more than his own people, and if he lets this war down quickly - well just look at what happened to Netanyahu's approval ratings as he started to deescalate the war with Gaza. He doesn't want to risk that.  
  
So in the mean time Russia is going to bleed Ukraine. They will send in more and more units to make this victory more costly for Ukraine. Putin doesn't realize it, but he's digging himself deeper and deeper into a hole he's eventually going to have to claw his way out of.

Es gibt viele Leute, die abbrechen oder nicht bestehen, die einen Burnout erleiden etc. Und es empfiehlt sich zu gucken, wie die Lage auf dem Arbeitsmarkt in etwa aussehen wird, wenn sie fertig ist (in frühestens sechs Jahren), soweit ich weiß gibt es eher zuviele als zu wenige Juristen.

I believe a federal EU would be the best option for current and future issues. I'm also someone who is opposed to nationalism so the formation of a federation from a region with a past like Europe would be a nice symbolic gesture. 

However i may be stating the obvious but the EU will need serious reforms before we can do something like this. 

I would also like to tackle the popular arguments against a federal EU and give my opinion on them:

We would lose our culture: Why ? I don't understand what this means , there is no such thing as a european culture and no reason why anyone would be forced to give up their culture. Even the US which has always flaunted the ""melting pot"" idea where different cultures would merge into one has signicant differences between the East/West/Etc...

It would be less democratic as the power would be further away from the people: This argument is correct in theory but i don't like it because if you take it to it's conclusion the best regime is anarchy as it is the most democratic (in theory). Every individual rules themselves and only themselves.

The EU is run by technocrats/is corrupt/Etc... : I agree , the EU must be deeply reformed and made much more democratic to be a federal government. But i'm pretty sure that's obvious to everyone.

You make it sound like Britain's fueling Russia military. 

Thought I'd introduce a little fact here as it's not the first time I've seen this silly point dredged up today. 


&gt;On face value, few of the licences read like they matter much to the Kremlin’s military machine, with its $81bn annual budget. During the past 12 months, for example, the UK granted the ex­port of £480 worth of semiconductor chemicals, and £6,261 of swimming equipment.

&gt;Even when it comes to more sophisticated technology, the buyers have not been particularly belligerent organisations. Night-vision goggles were sold to students for a college pro­ject, said Number 10, while small shipments of guns went for sporting purposes.

&gt;If anything, the state of UK weapons exports to Russia shows how little Moscow relies on foreign pow­ers for its military prowess.
Since 2000, the Kremlin has signed only 10 arms contracts of any significance with other nations.

Really? I don't know of a dialect that doesn't have it.

&gt; Since it's an allophone, many speakers may not even be conscious of the fact that it's different from [h]

Of course - but getting people to say the word ""huge"" and feel how different it is from ""hoot"" or something is a great place to start from. Saying ""this sound is completely foreign to you"" is not only wrong, it's also pedagogically damaging. I am mostly just combating the mentality - I find it very smug and self-satisfied when native speakers say ""this bit of my language is the hardest thing for foreigners ever!"" (native speakers are *least* well placed to have an opinion on what's hard for non-native speakers), and more importantly, non-native speakers *believe* them, which hinders their learning.

We *do* have the ich-laut - only in a small number of places, but it's a good place to start. I have never had a beginner who failed to pick the sound up within five minutes by my method, whereas those who are told to listen and repeat normally end up saying ""isch"" or ""ick"".

&gt; Only a very few languages have [ç] as a phoneme (I believe Haida, a native language of parts of Canada and Alaska, is one).

[Yep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_palatal_fricative) - a fair few have it as an allophone, though, and it's a bit of a shame for native English speakers not to take advantage of that!

There is also the part that when East Ukraine uprising began, position of US/EU was the opposite, reportedly making regaining of control of East Ukraine one of the conditions of first loans Poroshenko needed - which is considered in Russia one of the main reason why Ukranian government escalated to use of army vs. East Ukraine so quickly.

So yes, as far as most of Russian population is concerned, Obama and rest of US government sparked, nurtured and blew this warfire until it become self-sustaining.

From their view point - Russia has come out a very clear loser on international stage overall as the result of this conflict, while US benefited greatly economically - its LNG program now viewed much more favorably in Europe as alternative to Russian gas, Europe is more dependent on trade with US now that so many ties with Russia are getting cut, NATO is being revitalized and US arms exports are going to be doing well for decades due to this fiasco.

Norfolk, to name one, where ""huge"" is pronounced as if written ""hooge"". And there are several dialects where /h/ doesn't feature at all, such as Cockney.

&gt; but getting people to say the word ""huge"" and feel how different it is from ""hoot"" or something is a great place to start from

That is how it's taught, yes; but not everyone is able to then reproduce that sound in places it would never occur in their native language.

You probably don't realise this, but if you're like most speakers of English, the two Ps in ""pipsqueak"" are pronounced quite differently (the first is aspirated, the second is not). In many south Asian languages, the difference is crucial, but try pronouncing ""paper"" without aspirating the two Ps, and without making them sound like Bs.

If you can easily pronounce the [ç] in ""ich"", good for you. So can I. However, many can't, no matter how well they're taught, and this despite the fact that they can easily pronounce it in ""huge"".

&gt; I find it very smug and self-satisfied when native speakers say ""this bit of my language is the hardest thing for foreigners ever!""

Simplistic maybe -- it depends on the learner's native language. But not smug. There has to be *something* that non-native speakers find the most difficult about any language. In this case, it was assumed it was [x] and [ç], which may not be true, but I don't think it's ""smug"".

&gt; 
&gt; Gibt man den dialektalen Varietäten aber dieselbe Anerkennung in den Medien, in der Bildung und in Ämtern, existiert auch seine Formalität wieder. Dialekt kann formell sein
&gt; 
&gt; Jeder Muttersprachler weiss, wie Formalität im Dialekt funktioniert: wie in anderen Sprachen und damit auch dem Hochdeutschen. Eine ganz kurze Anleitung:
&gt; 
&gt; * Höflichkeit: andere Anrede für Respektpersonen verwenden
&gt; * Formalität: abstrakte Sprache und Floskeln verwenden
&gt;
&gt; Keine Angst also. Die Formalität bleibt mit dem Gebrauch von Dialekt natürlich bestehen und prägt sich gar noch vielfältiger aus.

Sätze solcher Dummheit erfüllen fast schon den Tatbestand der Körperverletzung. Formalität als sprachliches Phänomen ist untrennbar verbunden mit Verwaltung (darunter fällt auch Militär) und ihrer Kultur. Damit diese optimal funktionieren kann, ist Einheitlichkeit überall dort notwendig, wo Variation den Ablauf stört.  Schriftsprache gehörte immer schon dazu, die ersten beiden Orthographischen Konferenzen im Zuge der Deutschen Einigung bezeugen dies.  Mit der Verbreitung fernmündlicher Kommunikation wuchs  die Notwendigkeit, sich in einer Weise artikulieren zu können, die außerhalb der örtlichen Region verstanden werden kann, auch  ins Gesprochene hinein.
 
Mit der Notwendigkeit zu einer Pseudostandardsprache scheidet sich das Volk in diejenigen, die ihrer neben ihrem Mutterdialekt mächtig sind, und solche, die nur ihren Mutterdialekt beherrschen.  Im Rennen um knappe Beförderungen und den damit verbundenen Status wird dieser Umstand zu einem einfach zu verifizierenden Qualifikationsmerkmal. Je besser einer die Verwaltungssprache beherrscht, desto eher wird er für eine Beförderung geeignet sein.  Umgekehrt lässt sich jemand, »der nicht einmal richtig Deutsch kann«, leicht als tumber Provinzbauerntrampel abtun.  Pseudostandardsprache wird dadurch auch zu einem Distinktionsmerkmal. Dies wiederum zwingt alljene, die mit der Verwaltung in Kontakt kommen, – und das sind im Grunde alle –, zur Nachahmung, wenn man selbst nicht für einen Bauerntrampel gehalten werden will.  Auf diese Weise wirkt der Gegensatz in die Gesellschaft hinein und sorgt dort für Ärger bei denen, die sich herabgesetzt fühlen.

Dieser Komplex lässt sich nicht, wie der Autor es meint, durch eine »Aufwertung« des Dialekts aufheben, da, wie oben gezeigt, der Gegensatz aus der Notwendigkeit zur Einheitlichkeit entsprungen ist.

Turkey does not recognize European Union as a whole since it doesn't recognize Cyprus a part of EU and military occupies European territory (the north of Cyprus).

He also got the date wrong. Turkey has been an associate member since 1963.

Turkey has a population of 76.000.000.

Greece didn't back Cyprus and was in favor of Anan plan.

&gt;Greece believes it has a monopoly on the name Macedonia. Its main argument is that Macedonia is an ancient name for northern Greece. Macedonia argues that this has been the country’s constitutional name since the Second World War. 

Greece believes the ancient Macedonians were not Slavs and a country should not be allowed to plagiarize history.

&gt;Macedonia argues that this has been the country’s constitutional name since the Second World War.

FYROM declared intepentance and became a country in 1991.

&gt;The EU is insisting on good neighbourly relations as a precondition for accession.

Let me repeat that. The EU is insisting on good neighbourly relations as a precondition for accession. If it didn't have the good neighbourly relations Russia could also be a member.

&gt;Professor Dr Blerim Reka a former Ambassador of the Republic of Macedonia to the European Union in Brussels.

Thanks. Perhaps speakers from Norfolk would have difficulties with this sound (though I've met plenty of people from Norfolk, and all seemed perfectly able to affect both a 'regional' accent and a 'neutral' accent, but perhaps I've met a very specific bunch of people - similarly Cockney speakers, I'd guess, though I've not met many).

&gt; That is how it's taught, yes

I'm sorry, did you read my post *in its context*? I was replying to a specific poster who did *not* teach it this way - and, indeed, thought it couldn't be taught this way.

&gt; You probably don't realise this

I find this phrasing patronising and disrespectful. Stop it.

&gt; if you're like most speakers of English, the two Ps in ""pipsqueak"" are pronounced quite differently

I *do* know this. Like you and everyone else who knows this, I had to be taught it, of course. But I think it is *good* that people be taught this kind of thing. It is very valuable for people to learn this sort of stuff if it helps them to learn 'unusual' properties of their target language. English and German aspirate their Ps in the same way, though, so this particular property of P-sounds is a red herring in the context of German learning, as I'm sure you're aware.

But we're not talking about an individual country slashing tariffs, certainly not for the EU, and pragmatically not for the US either.

Let's, for pragmatism sake, say that the EU is a single country in that it is negotiating as a single trading bloc.  Yes, tariffs on average are low.

Leather tariffs are high.  

That makes no difference to the EU as a trading bloc.   None.  It's, on the face of it, inconsequential.  On the other hand, leather, woolen textiles, fishing or agricultural tariffs being high might be exactly what struggling EU states or regions don't want.   

It's not indicative of the whole.

In fact, high tariffs on such significant markets, but with other insignificant commodities driving the overall average down, might be the very opposite of what the whole EU *needs*.  These are prominent markets, in struggling member state economies, that domino into further larger state bail outs.  

Existential labour rights aren't working.  People still wear Nike.  Domestically people are still suffering, and questionable labour outside the EU or US is prevalent.

Don't be annoyed, it's usually Polish people and people from other ex-soviet counties who think this because their history lessons are full of revisionist bullshit from the USSR about how they were ""saved"" by their Slavic brothers and the West abandoned them and the West only got involved when the West was threatened. Unfortunately despite this being complete bullshit it is still taught in ex-soviet countries in schools and so a lot of people incorrectly parrot it on /r/Europe, it isn't their fault really though, they don't know any better. I only realised this when I went on an exchange a few years ago to teach English as a foreign language in Poland and was very surprised (and even angered) by what they were being taught as history in their colleges.

Some of them do so for historical reasons: Russia's ""first channel"" is a direct descendant of USSR's main TV channel, which people trusted for decades.

But I think the real culrpit here is that people got into a trap during Euromaidan.

The majority of people in eastern Ukraine didn't like Euromaidan: not just its cause, but also the fact that it was violent. People in Donetsk had even more reasons: they were trying to oust the President who was from Donetsk.

Few Ukrainian TV channels were openly anti-maidan, so people went to Russian channels for the news: Russian news coverage resonated with how they felt.

But the thing is, Russian TV added a lot of propaganda and disinformation. Much more than usual.

So it had a polarizing effect: those people went from simply disliking Euromaidan towards serious hatred of all Euromaidan supporters (basically, the rest of Ukraine).

Don't think so. The french and brits were blitzkrieged to death in weeks in defensive positions. It would have gone down even faster had their forces been outstretched in enemy territory.  Inferior tactics, inferior troops, inferior material, inferior everything. 

They were stuck in WWI thinking. Best they would have done is take 50 km, consider it a victory, then stop. I know some german commanders said germany would have collapsed had the allies launched a serious offensive, but I don't give much credit to them. Sounds more like taunting to me.

Menu:  http://www.krishna-bhavan.com/menus.php

It is usually filled with Indian people.  The food is very tasty.  The service is a bit hit and miss, but if you want a relatively inexpensive but tasty meal, it is great.  It is very basic in terms of decor, but they have improved it over the past six months.  I guess what I'm saying is that it is nothing fancy.

I'm personally opposed for a variety of reasons, however the most important of which is I feel people do not identify with the EU. For a state to function there must be a sense of common belonging and identity and currently this is distinctly lacking in the EU. While the people who frequent this sub are very cosmopolitan most Europeans are not and thus feel no connection to the EU as an institution, there's no cultural recognition of the institution as part of our identity. As a result I feel that union would be doomed as it would lack cultural/mental legitimacy. What it would almost inevitably end up as would be a variety of competing groups mutually resenting one another and dominated by the largest powers. This resentment  would likely foster further disunity. I think of it like the USA, currently a very divided nation socially and politically, but the issues would be a thousand times worse due to lack of a shared language or sense of history to bind us together.

true,SpecsaversGaza,ENGL,England,"You're taking a poll a trifle too seriously. Also the very nature of banter is typically about not taking things seriously, so what you're suggesting regarding banter is missing the point. More on that later. 

Seriously though, as you insist, I wouldn't be able to respond to such a poll seriously, it's nonsense based on stereotypes. The pollsters may as well have given folk an image of a man in a stripey shirt, a beret, smoking a gauloise, with a bicycle adorned with a string of onions - and a set of darts to throw at it. 

Nationalities and charactor traits don't march hand-in-hand, if they did life might be a little easier but dreadfully dull. France has hateful bigots just as England does, that doesn't make you and me bigots though it's just assigned one trait to a number of folk, the national boundary to it is almost pointless. 

My personal view of France is close to adoration, I adore it's cinema, it's artists, various other cultural gems and enjoy going there on a fairly regular basis. I'd not wear that on my sleeve, nor even mention it to a Frenchman until I though him worthy of being told. 

In misunderstanding banter, and I believe you have, you're missing an opportunity to actually get to know the English. It's de rigueur in both greeting and communication, a verbal version of a masonic handshake which, if done properly, will quickly reveal if someone is suitable to continue talking with. It's best done face to face but with a few sentences you can suss a strangers social class, intelligence, education, iconism, etc. Within the UK we do it between countries, regions and even cities, beyond we do similar with Australians, New Zealanders, South Africans, Canadians, etc... the yanks don't seem to get it though. 

There's been some whinging about banter ecently but I think it misses the point, it's a communication tool, there's an interesting article about it, decrying the notion of it being idiotic but suggested there's good and bad banter - I don't agree with any of those points though: http://realgrasshopper.wordpress.com/2012/03/07/if-you-participate-in-bad-banter-youre-an-idiot/

I was interested to hear Zizek talk about similar in the FYI, I'd link to it if I could find it - so it's not unique to the English - although we probably do do it best. ;)

And a huge population and problems with the goverment and the military leadership and freedom of the press and police violence like in Taksim Square and problems with religious minorities and...

&gt;And in no way does it change the fact that Greece is blackmailing Albania over territorial waters.

Actually Greece is one of the few that actively supports Albania joining EU as is one with the most benefits from Albania being in EU. The others complain that they don't want another mouth to feed. Under the Greek EU Presidency the Council of the European Union agreed to grant Albania candidate status thanks to the Greek suppport. And the European cross-border program for 2014-2020 from mutual economical development between the two countries is under discussion to be implemented as was the 2007-2013 thanks to Greek help.

Being in the EU means the territorial waters are open to all companies even if they are Greek, Albanian or Italian. Yes the problem with territorial waters should be fixed before Albania joins by cooperation but don't think Greece can do anything it wants. Likely in less than 5 years that Albania is expected to be in place to join EU.

You'll notice that there are three patterns, corresponding to either a definite article, indefinite article or no article. The no article adjective endings (strong adjective declension) generally end with the same letter as the article (if it were there) 

Ich trinke schwarze**n** Tee. Ich trinke de**n** Tee. 

The adjectives that come after a definite article (weak adjective declension) are pretty straight forward. If it's dativ or genitive, it's always en. If it's plural, it always en regardless of case and if it's anything else except masculine singular (also gets en), it's e. 

The adjectives that come after an indefinite article (mixed adjective declension) are actually a mixture of the other two. The nominative and accusative cases have the endings for the strong declension and the dative and genitive have the endings for the weak declension. 

I hope that helps. If you don't know the endings of the articles, it will make it a little more difficult, but they follow an easy to remember pattern.

Tout ce que je peux te dire est que l'Islam dans un pays comme la Tunisie pre-révolution 2011 était quelque chose de personnel et très modéré après c'est parti en couilles dans tous les sens (entre les mecs qui retournent leur veste du jour au lendemain pour se racheter une conduite, d'autres qui y voient une façon de faire du cash ; faut dire aussi que certains pays ont financé le parti islamiste qui ont acheté des voix, d'autres comme les usa... les ont soutenu implicitement etc...). Mais y a pas besoin de lire un bouquin de 1500 ans pour savoir différencier le mal et le bien. On n'inculque a personne de tuer à l'école et chacun a son libre arbitre pour ne pas se dédouaner sur les versets plus ou moins bien interprétés, faut porter ses couilles et arrêter tous ces délires. Bref on avait la chance d'avoir le pays avec le plus haut taux de scolarisation d'Afrique et surement en étendant à la région MENA avec 99% et ce n'est pas un hasard si l'Islamisme ne trouvait pas son public, puis la crise est arrivée, une misère encore plus forte dans les villes pauvres, un état plutôt répressif (mais y avait bien pire) ce qui fait un foyer favorable au développement de cette gangrène qui est l'Islamisme. Je connais des pratiquants qui fuient les mosquées car ils n'ont rien à voir avec ces nouveaux islamistes 2.0 de la 25ème heure. 

Pour les personnages publics j'ai l'impression qu'il n'y a que des larbins.

Les médias aident pas non plus là-dessus et préfère donner leur vision des choses faire des procès d'intention que de laisser les gens se faire leur propre opinion. 
Je pense que ce n'est pas l'Islam qui doit passer à la période des lumières, l'Islam reconnaît d'autres prophètes par exemple. C'est plus son ""fan club"" qui doit ouvrir les yeux.

Is a total war with Russia something you actually expect to win? It's generally understood that a total war between NATO and Russia will involve a thermonuclear exchange which will leave Russia, Europe and the USA in bits. How do you prepare for a war you know you will lose even if you win?

Go against your gut instincts and focus on your economy. Instead of sanctioning Russia and forcing them to become self-reliant in the hopes that they will collapse before you do you should continue investing in them, buying up assets, buying up people, allowing the oligarchs to have multiple citizenships, allowing their money into your banks, getting the economic ties formed so strongly that Russia attacking the EU would be indistinguishable from Russia attacking itself.

Just imagine Europe 70 years ago and now compare it with what we achived until today. What do you think your grand or grand grand parents would have told you if you asked them 70 years ago ""What about a Europe with no real boarders, one currency (sure, you're britsh, so ignore that ;)), etc. [..]"" ?
I think from this point of view, the thought that some day Europe might be a federal union isn't that uptoian at all. 


People might call this unrealistic, stupid, etc. but you know what?
Sometimes, even (or especialy?) in politics you might need some ideas or toughts from time to time, acting as a 'bigger goal', that seem or might be a bit unrealistic, otherwise there would be no progress at all.
