true,ResurrectedTaxmaster,ROMA,Ferentari,"We're maintaining our situation, but life here hasn't changed much. We pay some of the highest taxes in the world, life for businesses here is a nightmare, bureaucracy is  something you have to deal with every day and it's a pain in the ass. I pay 24% VAT and a ton of other taxes for everything and stuff like cars or electronics  are much more expensive than in the west. Usually it's much cheaper to buy things from amazon.de or amazon.co.uk and that's incredibly sad considering that the British or the Germans make a lot more money than we do. A small family living in Bucharest needs about $300 a month just for utilities, but on the other hand the minimum wage is about 240$ and it's hard to get a better paying job unless you work in Engineering/IT or have relations and know who to bribe. The worst part is the healthcare, hospitals are so filthy they have cockroaches in them most of the time, even in the capital. Westerners have to worry about airborne diseases but our worries are even bigger and easier to spot with the naked eye. Nurses and medics don't give a shit about you unless you bribe them a little (and most people can't afford that so they're treated like shit, nurses yell at them, leave them to die, etc). The second worst thing about this country is the education system and the government. Kids are expected to read dozens of novels, learn C++/Python (in high schools where they focus on math-related subjects) and university level math meaning things like integrals, limits, derivatives, matrices and other stuff that most Americans don't know anything about until the first year of Uni. The laws are also formulated in a very ambiguous way so that influential people can get away with anything if they have relations and money.

The only good part is that the crime rate is very low, even with all these gypsies (and their gypsy clans) and the poverty in the rural areas. Corruption is very strong though. I don't know anyone in the parliament with a clean record.

Actual post-tax-and-welfare income for the lowest decile of the population will fall about 8% from 2010-2015 (from the IFS, which is well known and well respected), the rest of the fall comes from the Radical Statistics model of cash-equivalent falls in services provided. The cash-terms fall in services is similar across all income levels (£1,500 to £2,200, Figure 2), and obviously that's a much larger proportion of a higher salary than a lower salary. There are two obvious dubious points with this - first, as far as I can see, this is based purely on money spent, not value of service provided, so public sector wages could fall 5%, for nurses, teachers, binmen, bus drivers, etc, and this would record hundreds of pounds lost in services to each household, even if exactly the same people were being employed to provide exactly the same service. Secondly, they are taking this fall in service value as a percentage of disposable income, and not total income, without any clear reason.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Cutting spending doesn't cause poverty just as spending doesn't create wealth

Cutting spending on welfare programs causes poverty and spending is what actually creates wealth.

&gt; Consider that during the height of the spending boom in London more people were pushed out of affordability brackets for many essential services including housing which made them effectively poorer.

...because it was still a recession? I don't know about this spending boom that much, can you provide some more info?

&gt; Spending and ""growth"" and ""recessions"" are one thing. Wealth and poverty are another.

I didn't imply otherwise. I said that cutting spending causes recession *and* poverty. I didn't say they were related. I can see how some countries that have fast growth can still have high levels of poverty (eg. the US), but that doesn't make my statement false. Cutting spending slows growth and, if you're cutting welfare programs (which is what austerity is about also), it also increases poverty.

&gt; And your talking points are primitive left-wing politics. It doesn't even touch upon details of all these processes in terms of economics. 

Nice ad hominem. Also, I didn't go in detail because I was making a bullet point list, which is meant to be short and get to the point.

It was utter shit for everyone else.

First day of the magnificent Kingdom of Yugoslavia hundreds of protesters in Slovenia and Croatia were killed by the Serbian royal Army for protesting the creation of the state.

Politicians advocating for higher autonomy for Slovenia and Croatia were killed in parliament in Belgrade.

Ever since the inception of Yugoslavia after WWI, parties from other states were constantly pushing for more autonomy for themselves as they didn't want to be ruled by Serbia.

The Serbian king declared a dictatorship.

To say that ""it wasn't perfect"" is an understatement. It was an utter mistake, an attempt to force different cultures together. Cultures that lived separate lives for more than 500 years. Joining former Austrian territories with former Ottoman territories was a mistake that should not have been made.

No it would not. Like I said, through the whole duration of Kingdom of Yugoslavia, non-Serb parts of the country were constantly fighting for higher autonomy and higher rights. Such a country was not bound to live.

Interestingly, the most support ""Kingdom of Yugoslavia"" had gotten in the parliament was from Serb nationalist parties. Easy to see why.

There's this myth with you romanians that everything is so expensive in your country and woe you but everything is very cheap there. 

Cars? They're like 20% cheaper than the prices in western europe and you have dacias cheaper than anywhere else and they are great cars.

Electronics? Are you fucking shitting me? I stocked up on electronics like crazy when I was living there. I was buying the newest graphics cards and shipping them off to friends in europe where they couldn't even get them nevermind the price!

And don't get me started on your internet. Gigabit internet for like what... $15 US? Mobile internet costs like $3 and it works everywhere.

Food? Great quality and it costs like half what it costs in western europe. I could buy a whole kilo of cheese and a whole kilo of tomatoes for one dollar each! I can't even afford a kilo of cheese in Belgium without breaking the piggybank. Fruit! Meats! Everything is dirt cheap there!  Fast food is more expensive than fresh produce and meat!

Beeeeer! Oh my freaking god I could buy a beer in a bar for one euro and it wasn't a bargain bin brand. It was only lagers but I can live with that.

I will give you that the salaries are sometimes low (though my romanian coworkers were taking home almost 2k euros after taxes) but you pay next to nothing in income taxes. What's you income tax?

true,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"&gt;Because they're apathetic, uneducated, ill informed,

People don't become apathetic by themselves. Apathy is a result of alienation from the system; Why be active if your activity effects nothing? 

Education is another matter of social alienation; In a society in which the wealthy benefit from a - for lack of a better work - proletariat that is not class conscious, surely they would gear their resources towards making the system prevent those people from gaining class consciousness. 

So, given that it is the elites that control society from the get go, the elites will gear their resources towards suppressing the consciousness of the people, and as such people cannot be educated or informed using normal social means; That is, you can't trust the system to educate you on the system's flaws.

&gt;or overly comfortable.

This I agree with, the people who are living comfortably(i.e. ""middle class"") want stability more than anything, and will not have the impetus to act unless that stability, and as such, their way of life, is threatened.

&gt;Revolutions can and do happen.

Do they? We can call the Euromaidan in Ukraine a revolution of sorts, but a revolution requires a systemic change. Most revolutions are not class conscious in nature and as such no *real* systemic change takes place, and one could argue in that situation that they're not really revolutions at all.

&gt;If people are unwilling to change it, or were unwilling to form it, then that's on them. They can't just give up their responsibility for the system they live in. Hell, most people would happily complain on reddit about a political or what have you problem, but couldn't be bothered writing to their MPs, starting a different political party, what-have-you. In their minds doing things is hard, and often hardly worth doing.

Of course, but people have to know there's a problem in the first place, and people have to know what the cause is. Knowing there's a problem is easy, knowing what's causing it is a matter of some difficulty if you're living within the system.

As we both probably know, a system only works based on the complicit nature of the individuals that live within it; But that doesn't mean that the individuals have any real, actionable power *within* the system. The one true actionable power that the general population has is the removal of complicit acceptance, asserting that the system justify itself, and at that point the system collapses. *That* is your revolution.

By voting different, or writing your MPs, you are not doing anything that is fundamentally going to change the system. Say you write an MP and he ignores you, and you vote him out of office; What has changed? In reality is it not simply that you have voted out one elite that ignores you in place of another? Once those who are in power realize they need only to pretend to listen, they will act solely in their own interests and in the interests of the system. Not of the population.

And say you start a party; No party is successful in any meaningful way if they are working *within* the system to *destroy* the system. The elites do not let the system be destroyed because the system is created by them to work in their favour. A classic example would be Murdoch's media empire, which can make or break politicians. 

So we must ask ourselves; If the system is created to preserve itself, how can we trust the system to educate its subservient populace on how to destroy it? It simply wont. People, to change a system meaningfully, must act outside the system. And people don't know that as long as they're indoctrinated to work within the system or indoctrinated to feel that there is no point to trying to change the system at all, will never be able to actually change it.

Running again with the Euromaidan revolution, the people had finally found the capability to act outside the system, but as soon as they pushed the system to breaking point, the system gave them fake concessions and instead of dismantling the system can effecting real change, the people decided to keep the very same system that caused the problem in the first place.

And that is because they were not class conscious enough to recognize the problem, and that's because they've been educated by the system, not because they're apathetic or lazy.",0,1409855046,null,0,false,0,ck955b0,t3_2ffstb,t1_ck955b0,t1_ck945v2,null,1427197515,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,Brandmon,MALT,Malta Pajjiz tal-Miki Maws,"One thing that is taken out of proportion is staring people in the face: Fertility rates. It is formulated poorly at present and also projected appallingly for the future.

At present, I too often see Total Fertility rates of whole countries compared to Specific Fertility Rates of immigrants which, in turn, are too easily assumed as Muslim. Thus you have the contrast both fertility rates which are not compatible and before you know it: *Our culture is doomed!*

Then you have projected future fertility rates. It is often assumed in this regard that:
1) The children of Muslims are inevitably Muslims. No exceptions. 
2) Such children will, in the future, have the same previously exaggerated fertility rate of about several children a family.

There are many holes in the above assumptions that can easily be spotted but here is the heart of the matter that is debunking the above: Muslim families from across the globe, from Muslim immigrants in Europe to people in Muslim nations such as Iran, Turkey, etc, for the past 30 years have seen a substantial decrease in fertility rates strongly suggesting projections that within a few decades fertility rates in such countries and communities will normalise their fertility rates to European levels.  In Iran, this is actually *already* the case, where the current total fertility rate is 1.7. (Google ""Iran fertility rate"" to see this drop projected in the clearest terms)

Thus once people take into account that Muslim fertility rates are actually projected to become equal to European norms *before* Muslims outnumber everyone else which, with all the wrong assumptions, would take 40+ years anyway, the whole idea simply breaks down.

And, for those who didn't click on before, you're one of *those* people - the so-called ""cultural protectionists"", who are living on the wrong side of history. 

&gt;Freedom of movement?? So I can just go into your house and sleep next to your daughter? No, right, you hypocrite, suddenly freedom of movement is restricted because it would be harmful to you. 

Unless we take your metaphor literally - in which you're scared that a migrant of a different ethnicity is going to sleep with your daughter (for such a specific example, it must surely be something that concerns you, and that you're extrapolating as an example) - I see no problem.

People flatshare with other people. Young people are often forced to share a house, against their own will, with their families because they're economically dependent. The idea of people from all backgrounds sharing a house isn't new or unique, and has been the theme of many sitcoms.

Additionally, as you say, liberties are limited when they encroach upon a person's rights - however, there is no human right of ""not having to live amongst foreigners"", and such a view goes against Enlightenment values. Property rights - a precarious assertion already - does not extend to the whole country. 

This country is not your home, you do not own it, and you do not have a right to lock people out of it.

&gt;Now understand that there are realistic people who protect our borders because it is harmful if anyone can just come and go into a country. 

On the contrary, evidence (both anecdotal and statistical) points to the exact opposite - it's no surprise that an immigrant nation grew to become the world's biggest superpower today while isolationist countries lie in squalor, and it's not co-incidence that China (a country which, for long periods in history, was vastly more developed than the West) stagnated circa-1200s when Zheng He was refused to continue his voyages, and the Emperor began executing anyone who left and returned to the country. Needless to say, the Opium Wars showed just how much this former-developed nation fell after once being the nation most likely to take the top spot.

I can cite numerous academic works in favour of this assertion, and other such assertions - contrary to belief, this is beyond dispute, this is academic fact.

&gt;You probably believe everyone is equal and deny facts like average iq differences(for example asians have the highest average iq). 

I believe that, if differences do exist, they should be compensated for. Otherwise, we are not living in a fair meritocracy if some people start in a higher position than others.

Besides, IQ Tests? The Flynn Effect has called the whole validity of those into doubt years ago. The fact that Mensa still uses them just goes to show how slowly it is for scientific knowledge to reach the general public.

&gt; Because nothing matters to you except the egotistical feeling of thinking that you are doing the just and correct thing, when in reality you have been taught to think this way and it is not in your or your peoples best interest. 

On the contrary, I would say that it's you who doesn't know what is your country's best interests. Blinded by tabloid claims that immigrants ""drag a country down"", against evidence of the opposite provided by the actual experts, you've grown to believe that anything which doesn't talk the same language or eat the same food as you do is a threat and an economic burden, when in reality it's the opposite.

Is there a sense of pro-equal utopianism there? Perhaps - after all, alongside benefitting the host country, remittances have been shown time and again to have a greater effect on helping poverty-stricken sending countries than the paltry amounts given in so-called government aid, and that money gets to the right people. There are studies which claim open borders would do wonders to lessen global inequalities. There is certainly that incentive.

However, should I tell you a better reason why I care? Because I'm going to be becoming an immigrant myself very soon, leaving this British backwater in favour of greener pastures, and I know exactly how difficult it is to jump through those hoops, and I know how difficult my future life is going to be because, surprise surprise, I've looked into it. Contrary to popular belief, immigration isn't as easy as just hopping on a plane and you're there.

You seem to be starting to agree with me. 

To cut the story short, the more laws imposed by the state on the hiring process, the more dislocations in the job market you are going to have.

Ideally, the job market should act like a conveyor belt. It should pick you up after graduation and drop you when you retire. Also ideally, you should have the same unemployment rate across all ages. 

The fact that there is a 50% youth unemployment proves that the conveyor belt is stuck. Because of the rigid labor laws, there are not enough [older] people exiting the workforce to make room for the young. 

A balanced economy does not make a choice between younger or older. The older people are more experienced, but they cost more. The younger ones are sharper, cheaper, but less experienced. 

Anything else being equal, an employer would want to hire at the both ends of the spectrum.

So, one thing you want to do is to erase all labor laws that impede employers to hire and fire people, such as forcing companies to pay severance for instance.

Ihre einzige Existenzgrundlage waren bisher die antagonistisch gestellten ""Faschisten in Kiev"", auf welche ich hier schonmal bezüglich ihrer Quantität und Qualität einging, s. Link. Des weiteren ist mir nicht ersichtlich, wie eine Miliz, bzw Sepearatisten, Legitimität aus einem vermeintlichen Umstand ziehen sollte, der mit der nächsten Wahl behoben wäre. Die Neuwahl wurde direkt nach dem Maidanputsch in Aussicht gestellt, außerdem wurde die Regierung von den Resten (-Teile Janukowitschs Partei) des 2012 gewählten Parlaments bestätigt. Des weiteren sollte man sich mal überlegen, wie es um die russische Minder/Mehheiten [vor dem ganzen Konflikt gestanden hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians_in_Ukraine#Lack_of_discrimination). So schlecht ja nicht gerade. Als eher reformistisch eingestellte Person frage Ich mich, inwiefern diese Separatisten also überhaupt als ""Freiheitskämpfer angesehen werden können und wie der Anteil an ideologisch fragwürdigen Kriegsspielern ausfällt. Diesen ganzen Rattenschwanz konnte ich mit einem 4-Worte Satz einem Troll/Infokrieger nahebringen, d-h- implizieren. Wenn er es einfach ignoriert hätte, was ja nunmal Standard bei denen ist, wäre kein (Zeit)Verlust bei mir entstanden, was allerdings bei dem halben Roman inklusive Links hier geschehen wäre.

Kurzum: wo liegt dein Problem mit meinem ""Stil"" jetzt? Bis jetzt kam ja nur die Beschuldigung der ""billigen Rhetorik"" (Polemik) und ""Ironie"" (Auch wenn Zynismus gemeint war). Was ist so schlimm an Polemik und Zynismus? Da muss auch schon bisschen was an Substanz hinter deiner radikalen Ablehnung sein. Dass Ich es nicht nachvollziehen kann, hab ich ja nun schon mehrmals zum Ausdruck gebracht.

true,demostravius,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Well aside from the fact it was a tongue in cheek comment I will give you my reasons for being pro monarchy (like the vast majority of the UK).

The Monarchy (or the crown estate in particular) ensures our land remains free to use, with the abolition of the monarchy the land would either revert to the Windsor's or be snatched up by the government. If it's the former we risk it being sold off to private developers. If it's the later we risk it being sold off to private developers. I for one like being able to visit all these places.

Secondly the Monarchy adds a lot of flavour and comes steeped in tradition. Instead of just having 'The British Navy' or 'The British Air Force' we get Royal, this and Royal that. I like having a Royal Mail, I like having Royal Societies they are far more interesting than departments.

Thirdly the Monarchy is a great diplomatic tie to other commonwealth nations. The people love them, they are a great headline and she brings the country together like few other things do. Just look at the Royal Marriage and the birth of Prince George, even the Americans love it. The Royal Family has an air of grace and pageantry that you don't get with fake TV, they are a giant soap opera that has the benefit of being real.

Finally, ALL countries have a problem with a few people holding too much power, having too much sway over things, owning too much land, etc. I would much prefer we keep the number 1 family in the public eye, under scrutiny, rather than free to get up to nefarious things.

I completely agree with you that it's daft anyone should get something in life simply because they where born into it.

Chi viene beccato senza abbonamento o biglietto (l'1% dei passeggeri) viene come detto prima portato in questo stanzino e ad uno ad uno vengono chieste le generalità proprie e l'indirizzo della famiglia a cui verrà notificato tramite verbale l'infrazione commessa e un corso di rieducazione civica presso un centro regionale gestito dalla Lega Nord.

La mia impressione è che al giornalismo ci si arrivi da tante strade. Alcune più canoniche, altre più affidate al caso e la fortuna. Per questo consigliavo a OP di tenersi comunque una strada alternativa aperta, altrimenti si rischia di finire a fare il freelance pagato a cazzo, le poche volte che il mercato gira bene.

Anche perché, nell'esempio del giornalismo economico, non basta saperne a pacchi di economia. Bisogna anche saperla spiegare, saperla scrivere, e entrare in dinamiche da redazione che poco hanno a che vedere con la materia di cui si tratta, e molto hanno a che vedere con la capacità di saper gestire tempi e spazi di scrittura.

That's where that was. Additionally, you had to be 20 years old, at least, and license period was for 1 year. It applied to all guns - hand guns and long rifles and shotguns.

Until November 1938 even Jews *could* own firearms, though it was probably not likely they would get a license, but after November the *Verordnung gegen den Waffenbesitz der Juden* became law, and effectively disarmed the Jews.

If EU and US will provide slightly higher pressure (some more sanctions + help to Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova) - there is good chance to see the fall of Soviet Reunion before World Cup 18. It seems Kazakhstan is already moving into this direction after recent phrase of Putin how Kazakhstan was created on a territory which never had any state on it - and Belarus is openly exploit Customs Union to bypass Kremlin's self-inflicted sanctions and organize government-sponsored ""contraband"" of forbidden products from EU into Russian Federation.

It's serious but it won't lead to new cold *war* - just a couple *cold battles* maybe - because population of RuFed is close to boiling point (it's obvious Kremlin has nothing to offer to develop the country - only prayers for higher prices of oil and gas and invasions into nearby countries), government's bankruptcy and/or severe sanctions may spark explosion of separatism. Either RuFed will remove Putin and its government from control (and army from Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia) or there is serious possibility for the ""empire"" to go belly up in couple years. 

I bet local bureaucrats already have plans what to do as separate countries, in fact [there are already ready-to-use customs post structures *inside* RuFed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacjJL4WVsU) + regions of RuFed already act as separate states, they have less integration than countries in EU and that is why Kremlin was so hysterical about Ukraine and Georgia signing association agreement with EU - because it's almost the same level of integration as relations between regions within RuFed. Another example: when a citizen move between regions of RuFed she/he need passport and *visa on arrival* (a.k.a. ""registracia"") which is strongly linked to property ownership rights and act more like ""localized/temporary citizenship"" (if you don't own another real estate you can legally live within estate where you have *registracia* indefinitely without consent of other tenants) so citizens either have to purchase real estate to acquire ""localized citizenship"" or bribe someone to get their passport stamped with local visa - I heard about case where 40,000 (!) people were illegally registered within the same real estate property in Sochi (by FSB itself, mind you).",0,1409857567,null,0,1409864667,0,ck96hva,t3_2fh8s7,t1_ck96hva,t3_2fh8s7,null,1427196885,64,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,64

&gt; Ich rede(/argumentiere) nicht nach irgenjemandes Schnauze. Wenn ich Lust hab Truther, Infokrieger, Trolls und andere Dummschwaller mit Polemik Pfeffer zu geben, dann mach Ich das.

Dito. Ich tendiere eher zum Oberlehrertum, Du zum Zynismus. Ich neige zur Selbstkritik und Kritik an denen, die mir näher sind, und zum Versuch des Dialogs mit denen, die weiter weg sind. Ich suche nach Begegnung, nicht nach Schlagabtausch. 

&gt; Was ist so schlimm an Polemik und Zynismus?

Provoziert oft negative Emotionen auch da, wo man sie nicht intendiert hat. Ist zur Abwehr geeignet oder zur Identitätsstabilisierung, steht aber dem ""Erkenntnisgewinn"" und dem konstruktiven Dialog im Weg. 

Ich bin einfach etwas dünnhäutig gegenüber Polemik bei Themen, die mir wichtig sind, egal ob sie für oder gegen meinen Standpunkt spricht. Und das führt dann gelegentlich zu solchen herummoralisieren. Ich sag nicht, dass ich meinen Ansprüchen selbst genüge; das wäre schön. Aber ich bemühe mich, und vielleicht schwappt etwas von dieser Bemühungsenergie manchmal über und trifft andere wie Dich. 

Wie auch immer, bis zum nächsten Mal :)

true,jeanralph,ZBSVUE,U-E,"Avec plaisir, c'est un de mes films préférés. Spoiler alerts pour la suite de mon post, évidemment.

Il y'a à mon sens deux éléments différents qui caractérisent ce film : son contexte limité dans le temps et dans l'espace (New York dans les années 70) et d'autre part l'aspect intemporel et universel de la psychologie du personnage principal. Evidemment, il y'a de forts liens entre les deux aspects et la psychologie de Travis ne serait pas mise en valeur sans le contexte adapté.

1 - Le film se passe à New York dans les années 70. Aujourd'hui, en particulier Manhattan où je crois vit Travis, c'est devenu Disneyland. Mais à l'époque il y'avait des taux de criminalité importants, même Times Square était glauque et il y'avait une impression générale de délabrement urbain.

Cette impression est relayée par le cinéma d'époque. Un film qui précède de deux ans Taxi Driver, Un justicier dans la ville (Death Wish, avec Charles Bronson), montre un *vigilante* new-yorkais qui tue des agresseurs en signe de ras le bol contre le chaos et le crime. D'après wikipédia, les spectateurs applaudissaient durant ces scènes (pourtant moralement ambigues, comme Taxi Driver en fait) ce qui donne une idée du ras-le-bol général partagé par d'autres dans la vraie vie.

2 - En gardant toujours à l'esprit cette impression de déliquescence urbaine en arrière-plan, il y'a aussi la personnalité de Travis Bickle qui joue. 

Pourquoi lui en particulier ? Parce que c'est un jeune homme déraciné (son accent et l'histoire laissent entendre qu'il est originaire d'un bled dans le Midwest et n'a pas de proches en ville), un vétéran du Vietnam (stress post traumatique ? Réinsertion difficile ?) et qui a une certaine notion de la rectitude morale et de la ""pureté"", qu'il oppose en permanence à sa réalité quotidienne de citadin qui vit dans une poubelle.

Pourtant ce qu'il faut aussi réaliser c'est que ce n'est pas simplement un bourgeois sympathique devenu justicier malgré lui comme l'est Charles Bronson dans Death Wish. Travis ne bouffe que de la merde, ne fait aucun effort pour sociabiliser (malgré qu'il n'aime pas sa propre solitude), avale des pilules et veut montrer qu'il a un côté bad boy (la raison pour laquelle il emmène Betsy voir un porno). En fait il travaille de nuit dans les pires coins de la ville alors que rien ne l'y oblige tout court, donc il s'est auto-imposé une vie dissolue et un sentiment d'aliénation permanente (et il sabote ses propres rencards amoureux !). Bref, Travis a une vie de merde, ne trouve pas de satisfaction à vivre en ville et à interagir avec autrui. Mais il est responsable de ses choix de vie, et s'il a une vie de merde c'est peut être pour s'auto-victimiser et se ""nourrir"" de la décadence qu'il entend dénoncer (Paul Schrader le scénariste l'a indirectement suggéré dans une interview) depuis son surplomb moral. Le taxi est un symbole de cette situation, vu que c'est une profession à la fois solitaire mais aussi avec des interactions sociales permanentes qui restent superficielles et pas très satisfaisantes.

Ses interactions avec Palantine est une partie que j'ai du mal à comprendre moi-même. Mon interprétation personnelle, c'est qu'il cherche à assassiner Palantine afin de faire parler de lui dans les médias comme beaucoup d'autres l'ont depuis depuis. 

Plus pragmatiquement, je pense que cette tentative de meurtre sert surtout à montrer que Travis est un personnage au mieux ambigu, capable du pire comme du meilleur et instable (et au pire vraiment un sale type et un fou criminel), car sans ce passage ses seuls meurtres seraient celui d'un braqueur et celui d'un proxénète d'une prostituée de 12 ans et des mafieux autour. Même le meurtre du proxénète joué par Harvey Keitel est moralement ambigu (Travis s'est auto-nommé justicier sans que personne ne lui demande quoique ce soit), mais ça avec Palantine ça impose de se rappeler que la volonté de Travis de ""devenir quelqu'un"" et de ""montrer sa force"" (il en parle dans ses monologues) ne connait pas vraiment de grands principes non plus.

La fin du film est ironique. Travis, un personnage égo-centrique et destructeur quand on connait ses vraies intentions, devient un héros dans les médias parce que personne ne va nier ce statut à un jeune homme qui a fait le travail de la police en mettant hors d'état de nuire (dans un contexte général d'insécurité) le proxo d'une fillette. La fin, qui commence comme le début du film, laisse penser qu'il n'a rien appris et est prêt à récidiver de nouveau un de ses jours.

Pour l'anecdote, Paul Schrader a écrit le scénario sans parler à personne ni sortir de chez lui pendant plusieurs semaines. Il l'a aussi écrit avec un flingue chargé à portée de main et sous-entend que l'oeuvre est partiellement autobiographique en ce qui concerne son sentiement de solitude et d'aliénation. Ca aide à représenter l'état d'esprit.

J'oublie surement beaucoup de choses, c'est un film riche en concepts et qui laisse la place à la vision des choses de chacun. J'ai des amis IRL qui soutiennent toujours que Travis est effectivement un héros qui a raison d'agir ainsi.",0,1409857782,null,0,1409859229,0,ck96m0a,t3_2fh34v,t1_ck96m0a,t3_2fh34v,null,1427196832,14,false,france,t5_2qhjz,14

true,ResurrectedTaxmaster,ROMA,Ferentari,"2000$? 

You're like an American living in Silicon Valley saying Detroit and everywhere else in the USA is perfect. You've experienced the best Romania has to offer. Do notice that the minimum wage in Romania is 240$ and you said your colleagues were making 2000 EUROS (after taxes??),  meaning $2500. Simple math says that your colleagues were making more than 10 times what a minimum wage worker makes in one month, meaning your friends worked only one month to get an amount of money a poor Romanian would have to work their ass of *for an entire year*.  That's an attractive salary everywhere in the world, but in Romania it's HUGE. How can you consider yourself worthy of speaking for an entire country if you only lived near to people who were making thousands of euro a month? About 40% of Romania is rural. I'd love to see a peasant make 2000 a month shoveling manure, now that would be funny. Also, what a coincidence. Our president apparently makes 6700 lei a month which is about 2000$. Obama makes $33333 a month but I guess that's appropriate for ""the most powerful man in the world"".

&gt; See here's the thing: I lived in Bucharest for a while as an expat. Utilities only set me back about 600 lei and I was living it large in a 3 bedroom apartment so I don't see how you can hit $300 in utilities. I'm paying almost 600 euros in utilities now in Belgium.

Note that I said ""small family"". Also, minimum wage is 800 lei in Romania and you just said that while being on your own you spent 600 lei on the bills alone and the government thinks that you can afford food, clothes and luxuries with those 200 lei that remain. A traditional family made of a working father and a stay-at-home mother is difficult to sustain given those conditions. The average wage in Romania is about 1600 lei. After you pay the utilities you're left with 1000 lei which is 300$ for non-Romanians. With 300$ you have to afford new clothes, food, going out, watching movies, buy furniture and electronics like a TV (a 40 inch TV is about 500$) or a smartphone (a nexus 5, considered a midrange phone is 350 euro in Romania). Most families also have only one person who works (the father) and has to sustain a few other family members or friends.

&gt;Cars? They're like 20% cheaper than the prices in western europe and you have dacias cheaper than anywhere else and they are great cars. I remember someone in my office bought a VW Gold for 15000 euros while another friend of mine that was living in Scandinavia bought almost the same model for 45000 euros.

Romania is full of cars that have Bulgarian license plates. I'll leave you to think about why that happens.

 A car is 20% cheaper but are salaries here only 20% smaller than in the rest of Europe? Minimum wage in **Poland** is almost double than it is in Romania, about 400 euros. Minimum wage in Poland is higher than the average wage in Romania. Yes, that's true, look it up. Do you think a Romanian cares about 20% cheaper cars when he struggles to make what in Poland is considered the absolute minimum wage? And that's Poland, I won't even talk about Germany, UK, France or goddamn Scandinavia. You're being silly here.

&gt;Electronics? Are you fucking shitting me? I stocked up on electronics like crazy when I was living there. I was buying the newest graphics cards and shipping them off to friends in europe where they couldn't even get them nevermind the price! After I moved to Belgium I had someone buy me the laptop in Romania and send it to me because it cost HALF what it cost here!

you mean second hand? An online shop that sells electronics even made an article saying that buying from other countries, especially from the UK isn't cheaper than buying from them.  http://blog.pcgarage.ro/magazin-pc-garage/componente-pc-mai-ieftine-%E2%80%9Cafara%E2%80%9D-mit-sau-realitate/

Here's a gtx780 Ti as an example:

http://www.pcgarage.ro/placi-video/asus/geforce-gtx-780-ti-directcu-ii-oc-3gb-ddr5-384-bit/

http://www.amazon.co.uk/GeForce-DirectCU-Graphics-Express-DisplayPort/dp/B00HFMPMX6

3277 lei vs 2665 lei (from UK, link below, same model) . Even without the price cut Amazon sells that GPU at 2750 lei. My gpu, a 7850, was about 1150 lei in Romania. In the UK it was always much cheaper. In the USA my HD7850 was 180$ at that time. The popular entry level smartphone is Moto G and it's $130 in the USA, in Romania it's about $300.



&gt;And don't get me started on your internet. Gigabit internet for like what... $15 US? Mobile internet costs like $3 and it works everywhere.

Gigabit isn't available everywhere though. That's the only good thing about living here, that and piracy laws that aren't enforced at all, and very rarely someone gets busted for cybernetic crimes. And no, mobile internet is a bit more expensive than that. The 3$/month internet you're talking about is probably slow mobile internet that's capped at about 100 or 200MB a month.

&gt;Beeeeer! Oh my freaking god I could buy a beer in a bar for one euro and it wasn't a bargain bin brand. It was only lagers but I can live with that.

Since when is food a worry? even someone from the rural parts of the country can afford beer and almost anything he wants to eat. Why do you think villages are full of drunken hobos who pick fights with people all the time? Alcohol is something everyone can afford and if they're too poor to afford a beer chances are they're living in a rural area where they have the means to make their own stuff like Palinca, Tuica, wine or whatever.

&gt;I will give you that the salaries are sometimes low (though my romanian coworkers were taking home almost 2k euros after taxes) but you pay next to nothing in income taxes. What's you income tax? Flat 16%? Call me when you're paying 45%. Your VAT is high but you have basically no property taxes. Back home in Canada I am paying through the nose for not selling my apartment after moving out of it.

Did you seriously compare CANADA to Romania? Canada is one of the best countries you can live in. Every wealthy Romanian person moves to another country when they require medical aid, they know that money can buy better things than what Romania's free ""healthcare"" can provide.  

And also, taxes are much higher. You end up paying around 50% of what you make after you take into account income tax (16%), health tax, insurance and the other taxes that you have to pay.  I don't know where you lived or where you worked but taxes here are so high that working illegally is extremely popular, even though it obviously has severe consequences. People would rather sacrifice their pension than to starve to death working like a slave for minimum wage. 

&gt;Worst? You're complaining your kids learn C++ and Python? All the countries on this planet are desperate to introduce programming to the school curriculum and you are dissatisfied that your includes it? Why? What possible reason could you have to complain about something like this?

We're talking about kids here. Children who are going through difficult times and don't have time for all that. C++ is considered a fairly low level language, it's a bad choice for a first language. It's too complicated. It's not for everyone. Something more simple like Java would've been a better choice. **Slamming a hundred books on a kids desk and telling him ""memorize all that or else!"" isn't education.** You can't force feed education and expect it to work. Paid tutors have become a trend here, you can't survive without one because there are specific rules you have to follow even when solving math problems. You have to write in a specific, robotic way or else you lose points. Same goes for language tests and others. Everyone cheats during their tests here, teachers getting bribed and offering extra, paid classes to students (in exchange for better grades of course) is a huge problem here. It's such a big problem that instead of buying furniture or equipment for schools they're put cameras everywhere. And guess what, the moment cameras are installed, the average grades in that place drop significantly.

&gt;Your highschool graduates can stand toe to toe with the STEM universtiy graduates of other countries and you think this is a bad thing? What is this bizzaro world?

You mean hypothetically or in practice? It's a bit optimistic to hope such a thing. Because every year about 60-80% students fail the Bacalaureat exam that they need to pass in order to graduate university. That's how much old literature, derivatives, integrals and C++ matters to 80% of the Romanian population. If you're a country full of poverty and corruption you can't hope to achieve what the USA, England, Japan and other more advanced countries couldn't. It's been proven that poverty and education greatly affect someone's IQ. That's why Romania has a fairly low average IQ. The 3rd or 2nd lowest in EU from what I saw here: http://www.photius.com/rankings/national_iq_scores_country_ranks.html

Die Bundesagentur für Arbeit kann eine medizinische Untersuchung zur Feststellung der Erwerbsfähigkeit anordnen. Bist du das nämlich nicht ist entweder Rentenkasse oder Sozialamt für dich zuständig, nicht die BA.

Das ganze liegt dann im Ermessen des Arztes ob da n Drogentest mit dabei ist, und die BA wird auch nur ein abstraktes Ergebnis erhalten, keine Details.

Einfach mal zu *fragen* ist da sehr viel niedrigschwelliger, fragen ob man einen Test machen will ist nicht mehr ganz so subtil... und kann man auch als Verpflichtung in eine Eingliederungsvereinbarung schreiben, denn die ist ja freiwillig wenn sie freiwillig unterschrieben, nicht angeordnet, wird.

Im Grunde genommen ist an so einer langsamen Eskalation gerade bei besonderen Spezis nichts einzuwenden. Wenn du den offensichltilchen Alki zum Arzt zum test schickst  *Das* ist nicht der Grund, warum das komplette System kaputt ist.

It wasn't at all because the deutschmark had failed, it was quite simply because Germany was one of the EU countries that had decided to make currency union a reality.

There were complaints, of course, and grumblings. There were fears that stores would use the changeover to hide price rises (there were cases where this did actually happen, but they were relatively few). But no panic.

Some months before the changeover, stores began displaying prices in euros as well as marks. I did notice some price rises *then*: there was a gentlemen's agreement in place that stores wouldn't raise their prices immediately after the changeover, so they adjusted prices beforehand, so that the eventual euro price would be X.99 or X.95 from the outset. But those price rises were modest.

A few weeks before the changeover, the banks started selling ""starter kits"", little bags containing all the euro coins that were to be issued so we could get used to them.

And then one day, the ATMs started spitting out euros instead of marks, the shops asked for payment in euros and gave change in euros, and that was pretty much it. If memory serves, half the vending machines were modified for euros before the changeover, and the other half after, but it was a long time ago and I'm a bit hazy on that one.

And then, after a few months, the DM prices disappeared from displays.

One of the most interesting things about the coins was that coins issued in different member states had (and, of course, still have) different reverses. I accidentally insulted a woman in a kebab shop by looking carefully at my change to see if any of the coins were from Italy or something. ""You don't need to count your change,"" she said.

My comment:

This is actually not really true, or at least not to that extend. A lot of companies just use the demographic change to lower wages because they can pay foreign workers less money (up to 50% in engineering) and more or less expect germans to assimilate. If there really was a lack of workforce wages would go up. Oh and don't forget that Germany is shifting to the right, besides most german people are incredibly rude fuckwits.

Ich bin keiner von denen die meinen es sei eine Steuer und deshalb der Bund und nicht die Länder zuständig, das kann man so und so sehen. Der Bund würde auf jeden Fall nichts anders machen.

Das Problem ist der Staatsvertrag. Der wird nämlich zwischen dem Bundesland in dem du wohnst und den Rundfunkanstalten geschlossen. Ein Vertrag zwischen zwei Parteien welcher eine dritte Partei, nämlich dich, zur Zahlung von Beiträgen einer nicht bestellten Leistung verpflichtet. 

Das gibt es im deutschen Vertragsrecht überhaupt nicht. Der Staat kann nicht an deiner statt zu deinem Nachteil mit einer anderen Partei einen Vertrag über dich abschließen. Das ist völlig abstrus, ein eklatanter Rechtsbruch. Das gibt auch das Grundgesetz nicht her und ich sehe auch nicht, dass irgendein Gericht dies nicht anerkennen wird.

Weiterhin verstößt der Vertrag gegen die informationelle Selbstbestimmung sowie deine Persönlichkeitsrechte. Eine Zwangsanmeldung kennt das deutsche Recht nicht im Falle von öffentlich rechtlichen Einrichtungen. Es ist schlicht rechtswidrig dich irgendwo anzumelden, wenn du dich nicht damit einverstanden erklärst. Auch hier sehe ich keine Chance, dass ein Gericht dies als zulässig erachtet.

Dann wird gegen den Gleichbehandlungsgrundsatz verstoßen. Jemand der eine Wohnung, einen Ferienwohnsitz, eine Gartenlaube und ein Büro hat, zahlt für jedes Objekt Gebühren, obwohl er nur an einem Ort den ÖRR konsumieren kann. Ich bin so ein Fall, habe Büro und Wohnung. Es ist kompletter Unsinn die Gebühren an eine Wohnung zu binden und gleichzeitig fürs Büro Gebühren einzuziehen. Gleiches gilt für die Arbeitgeber. Jeder Arbeiter der eine Wohnung oder ein Auto hat, also alle, zahlen bereits Gebühren um 24/7 ÖRR nutzen zu können. Nun sollen die Arbeitgeber das aber auch noch mal extra machen? Das verstößt völlig gegen den Gleichheitsgrundsatz, die Bindung der Gebühren an eine Wohnung ist schlicht illegal.

Die bereits ergangenen Gerichtsurteile der Verfassungsgerichtshöfe in Bayern und Koblenz sind für mich da auch kein Rückschlag, die Urteilsbegründung sind derart an den Haaren herbeigezogen, dass ich mir kaum vorstellen kann, dass das BVG einen ähnlichen Weg geht. Sollte es so sein, klage ich bis vor den EuGH. Hier findet ein Rechtsbruch sondergleichen statt, jedes Jahr wird das Volk um 8 Milliarden Euro erleichtert für Leistungen die in keinem Verhältnis zu den erbrachten Beiträgen stehen. Man rechne das mal hoch. 80 Milliarden Euro pro Dekade wenn denn die Gebühren stabil bleiben. Damit kann man Griechenland retten.

Ich kann das auch gar nicht oft genug betonen, der Deutsche muss aufhören sich alles von der Obrigkeit gefallen zu lassen und klagen so lange ihm der Rechtsweg noch offen steht. Unsere Regierung, die ÖR, jeder der stets gegen unsere Interessen handelt, sei es Waffenlieferungen, Kriege oder Rundfunkgebühren tut dies nur, weil wir es ihnen viel zu lange haben durchgehen lassen.

true,Jigsus,null,null,"I'm not going to insult you. I'm just pointing out that this image your romanians have of your own country and ""the west"" is ridiculous. I was actually clearing 3000 euros a month which is much more than the romanians were earning but they were earning pretty well on their own. The romanian coworkers were earning 2000. If you're an urban professional in Bucharest you're surely earning more than 1000 euros which is plenty considering the prices. Not even the cleaning lady earns minimum wage so I don't know why you bring it up. In my 1.5 years spent there I did not find a single person that really earned minimum wage. Maybe they were earning that on paper but the bonuses made up for it. I admit this is a limited experience but who do you know who earns minimum wage in Romania?

You have this ingrained inferiority complex in your country that I just don't understand. It's evident in your post too because you think CANADA is some supercountry compared to Romania. I left Canada because it sucks more every day. You say country names like they are holy. Corruption? It's about on par with what you experience in the US. At least no government employee will shoot you. Canada is just a few notches lower in corruption but corruption in Canada is all about sucking corporate dick. I remember it was snowing once in Bucharest and everybody was complaining about how lazy city hall is being and telling me that ""you clean the roads better than this in Canada"". No man... nobody cleans the roads during a blizzard better because it's impossible and then the blizzard stopped and the roads were clean of ice but everybody was still complaining. Is complaining your job?

Let me tell you about Canada where the middle class is getting crushed by tax burdens, our social liberties get eroded every single day and the cost of living just keeps going up. Large companies piss on our rights every single day and we're supposed to take it. Kids fall behind in school and the whole class is forced to fall behind. Fuck Canada. Compared to that the only problem you have in Romania is finding a good paying job. Guess what? Finding a job is hard everywhere these days. It's not like I can strap on my job helmet and squeeze down into a job cannon and fire off into job land, where jobs grow on little jobbies. Find a good paying gig in Romania and you're set. Hell find an online gig and you can earn enough to live a comfortable life there. That's it. You pay the little taxes and the government stays out of your way in Romania. They don't punish you for owning your own home. They don't punish you for being unmarried. They don't punish you for leaving something to your children. In Romania you can still be middle class.

I left Romania because I got a chance to work on something that could be my life's work but if this wasn't an issue I'd move back there in a heartbeat.


You say 60% of students fail to graduate a university? How many do you think graduate in other countries? 40% sounds about right for any country. You say your IQ test scores are low but I think that's just because you're not used to IQ test taking. In Canada they teach you how to score on an IQ test. Romanians are wicked smart and I have plenty of anecdotes to back that up but they don't matter. What matters is you sell yourselves short. Don't. Shit ain't better anywhere else trust me I've lived in a lot of countries.

And fucking hell stop looking to the government for help. Politicians from any country won't help you. The best you can hope is that they stay out of your way. Fuck minimum wage. Your goal in life isn't to earn that. If you push on that you'll end up with a country full of chavs like the UK.

Are you commenting on reddit from a different universe?

&gt;If you buy something without research and are surprised when you find that it's a piece of shit - then nobody should be responsible but you.

Sure. And the way people deal with that responsibility is to delegate it to an organization who has the means to decide about the right criteria and enforce them.

&gt;Because consumers keep stupidly buying it doesn't mean something should be banned.

They're not stupid buying it. They're buying it because they haven't got the means or the opportunity to carefully research the whole production chain of every single product they buy. So they just take into account what they can judge immediately: price, functions, design etc.

&gt;And has the disadvantage of limiting choice for something that wasn't causing anyone harm

It didn't cause direct harm, but of all ways to reduce electricity consumption and the associated trade balance and climate problems, this is rather non-intrusive way to achieve it which leaves the maximum amount of freedom of choice open. Believe me, we'll have to (not) do quite a lot of more and forcing vacuum cleaner manufacturers to follow different priorities in their designs is a very, very small effort with practically no cost.

&gt;There's no reason that a grant scheme needs to be inefficient or corrupt. That's a problem with the organisation, not the idea of a grant scheme.

Even open competitions where a government agency awards a contract to a specific firm are always a touchy issue because of the mere risk of favoritism. It's best to avoid that. A general rule of no wattage above threshold x is unambiguous and the same for everyone, no discussion, no suspicion.

true,antipositive,NRW,Rheinland,"&gt; One of the most interesting things about the coins was that coins issued in different member states had (and, of course, still have) different reverses.I accidentally insulted a woman in a kebab shop by looking carefully at my change to see if any of the coins were from Italy or something. ""You don't need to count your change,"" she said. ""I've been in this job for 20 years and I've never short-changed anyone."" So I tried to explain what I was doing, and she thought I was accusing her of slipping foreign coins into my change.

I was always looking closely at the change given, as the 20 and 50ct coins are stupidly similar in size.  
When I paid in a German supermarket with non-German Euro coins shortly after the change, I had a cashier asking her collegue if they are allowed to accept foreign coins. Guess the owner did not really school her about the new currency.

Furthermore, people aren't microstates; there is no definition in which a state is anything but a plot of land with borders with a governing body that has jurisdiction over said plot of land.

In your world the fruits of your labor are obtained violently and defended with violence or the threat thereof. Its exactly as how a state operates. There is no private property without a violent imposition of ownership, from the owner themselves or from a state, otherwise anyone could simply take everything they wanted from everyone.

What exactly is to stop the most wealthy of your society from buying a bunch of mercenaries and taking your stuff? If said army overpowers the private law enforcement entities of the area (or the person owns the private law enforcement of the area) then the answer is nothing.

true,0xnld,UKRA,Ukraine,"TL:DR It's very hard if you don't have a job offer already.

Immigrating means getting a residence and work permit (tourist visa is not immigration).

Getting a work permit usually requires having a contract or at least a written job offer from some business in receiving country. It also means said business needs to fill out the required paperwork to employ a foreign citizen. Studying in a university typically doesn't entail a work permit, only residence. There are some other ways, e.g. buying property (in some countries). There's also skilled migration points-based programs in some countries like Canada, Australia, UK, maybe others. Last time I checked, UK requires you to either have something like 50K GBP in current salary or a PhD if you don't have a job offer in your pocket.

So you have to a) possess desirable qualifications for potential employer  (often those qualifications need to be in short enough supply for company to justify importing you) b) pass the interview with them somehow c) often - pass the language test

UKIP and their cronies are basically longing for a return to the glory days of empire (which is why they like the Commonwealth so much – never mind that most of the Commonwealth don't want a Commonwealth free trade area) rather than looking forward at new ways we can be globally important.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"I'm not sure if I am really the right person to ask, but here are my thoughts.

I think the implementation of the euro was wrong, as I think it was an attempt to use economics to create a political Europe that was not there. I think in retrospect this was the wrong order. I think it would have made more sense to create the political Europe first, and to do this more slowly, with the direct consent of the people, via referendums. 

I think the political requirements for the euro to exist include mainly:

(1) a commitment by the south to reform labour laws, cut deficits and so forth. They need to be committed to this with oversight from outside.

(2) a commitment by the north to making vast (and probably permanent) transfers of money to the south, and essentially guarantee the debts of the south.

I think without these two commitments and consent to these commitments from the people via referendums, I would not have created the euro. I think in the case of the UK, the reality is (for a range of historical reasons) you would never have got the consent of the people, so I do not think the UK would ever have been part of it. I also think it would have been hard to get the swedes and Danes on board. I think this creates a very difficult tension within the EU - I therefore think those non-euro states should have left the union (and perhaps got some kind of associate status). I think it would have been possible to get the consent from the peoples of most other states, but I think in the case of the Netherlands, Germany and Austria they might not have given their consent to permanent transfers of wealth. I also am not sure how the French would have voted.

Perhaps I am asking too much? However, I think that the current situation will not be able to continue for ever. We already got some somewhat extreme results in some European elections and those of the member states. I think if the crisis is not resolved soon the politics will start to get very difficult.

Ich muss zugeben, dass ich nicht alle Texte gelesen habe. Mit Sandro (""dumme Sprüche"") und Antonia (""ach, im Osten ist es ja doch ganz nett"", ""kita = Kommunismus"") kann ich mich etwas identifizieren.

Ich persönlich bin 1989 geboren, wenige Monate vor dem Mauerfall. Was mich betrifft, habe ich nicht (bewusst) in der DDR gelebt, werde aber trotzdem oft irgendwas dazu gefragt. Ich habe keine Ahnung, wie es war, kenne keine Ostprodukte etcpp. Dieses unterschwellige ""das musst du doch wissen"" ist anstrengend.

Mich nerven genauso wie Sandro die ständigen, dummen Sprüche. Ich habe kaum bis keinen Dialekt und werde genau deswegen oft angesprochen: ""Ach, das hört man gar nicht, dass du aus dem Osten bist."" Es nervt, das immer wieder zu hören. Einem Berliner oder Schwaben sagt doch auch keiner, dass er wunderbar Hochdeutsch spricht?!

Neulich sagte mir eine Kollegin, dass sie niemals daran denken würde, in Sachsen oder Dresden Urlaub zu machen. Muss sie auch nicht, klar. Aber immer dieses kategorische nicht-in-den-Osten-wollen (hab das schon öfter gehört) ist (für mich) pure Ignoranz. Ich habe oft das Gefühl, dass viele denken, dass es ""drüben"" arg rückschrittlich ist, dass es dort nichts gibt, das ihre Zeit wert ist. Selbst am soliden Halbwissen fehlt es oft. Ich begegne oft Leuten, die nicht eine Stadt im Osten (außer Berlin) kennen und geographisch einordnen können.

Tl,dr: 1989 im Osten geboren, mich nerven dumme Sprüche/Fragen und schiere Ignoranz.

First off, former members of the USSR contain a large Russian minority, which is bound to want to go back to Russia, for reasons only they understand. It is the case of Moldavia, it was the case of Crimeea etc. To be honest, I kind of understand them. Between being poor in a country where you are the minority and being poor in a country where you are the majority, I too would choose the second option.


Second of all, there are people in these countries (ex-communist countries I mean) (In Romania the amount is quite significant, about 25%) who really miss the old communist regime, because of the failures of the regimes that came afterwards. According to these people, times were better back then, you actually had money even if there wasn't anything to buy because there wasn't jack shit available, one had a steady job, got a flat from the state (even if in a shitty area of town) etc. This could be mistaken for a pro-Russian attitude by an outsider, but make no mistake: at least in Romania, while 1 in 4 people miss the old communist regime, most people distrust or outright hate Russia.",0,1409868240,null,0,1409868656,0,ck9c697,t3_2fh8s7,t1_ck9c697,t1_ck98b65,null,1427194146,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14

This is like an obese person slimming down and working out to turn fat into muscle. Our country keeps spending on things even our military [doesn't need](http://www.businessinsider.com/congress-approves-useless-military-spending-2013-5). And since Sept 11th, we had an explosive defense budget that was unchecked; we're spending without a budget basically, which leads to things like you know, debt. The second part is that high military spending cuts into our economy for things like assistance to states which lead to job creation for teachers, government workers, and so on.

Getting this straight from the estonia.eu website: 

""In 1992, almost one third of the Estonian population had not determined their citizenship. Estonia's position is that citizenship cannot be forced on anyone and that everyone has the right to choose his or her citizenship. The Estonian Government encouraged persons of undetermined citizenship to either apply for Estonian citizenship or choose another citizenship (Russian, Ukrainian, etc.). During the course of this campaign, carried out from 1993 to 1998, a number of these residents received Estonian citizenship, while others acquired the citizenship of some other country.""... 
And also: ""On June 3rd 2014, the Estonian Parliament passed an amendment proposed by the Chancellor of Justice making applying for citizenship easier for young people who despite not having a residence permit, have resided in Estonia permanently. The amendment makes applying for citizenship easier for those young people, whose legal guardian has not applied for a residence permit for them before they reached the age of 15, but who have been factually living in Estonia for at least eight years. These people are granted citizenship, if they have not become the permanent residents of another country and they have a valid residence permit or right of residence at the time they are granted citizenship.""

So I don't see how children would have to write a test.

The word is ""Türkenwichser"".

If you take that as standard German it translates to ""turkish wanker"" and it's probably one of the worst insults you can hurl at turkish immigrants. Please never do that, ok?

However ...

It's actually a traditional dish. Here's why:

""Türken"" is not only the plural of ""Türke"" (turk), put also a word for corn. Today we usually use the word ""Mais"" for corn, but in some regions in the south it was and sometimes still is called ""Türken"".

And the ""Wichser"" comes from the way the dish is prepared. ""Wichsen"" does not only mean jerking off, it also means for example polishing shoes (""Schuhe wichsen""). So the word is used for describing a fast, repetitive motion with your hands/arms.

I compiled all this data about employment in Europe in the few hours between sleep and work. I made it purely for my own enjoyment. The idea came to me after I overheard a conversation between two men at a bus stop I was waiting at last week. In particular it was because of this one sentence that one of them said angrily: *How can this country achieve something when only a million and a half are the bread-winners for all of its 7-million population?!*  So then I thought he’s most likely exaggerating and made it my quest to find out the truth. Turns out he was either wrong or just had old data. TIL! :)


I have to note the following:

* Estonia had **the highest decrease** in Employment growth in comparison to the EG data for Q4 2013.

* Hungary had **the highest increase** in Employment growth in comparison to the EG data for Q4 2013.


I wasn’t sure how to project the above 2 points in the table, so I decided I’d leave it for my comment here.


I believe I did my best. Hope it’s comprehensible and I’m sorry if it’s not colour-blind friendly and if I made any grammar mistakes!

Back in my university days, I've been organizing the Hungarian branch of an international student exchange scheme and by far the most work I had was with Middle Eastern and African students, despite being well-prepared.

The invitation letter was 3-pages long, included every details of both the student, the inviting university (gladly it was all sanctioned, without it I think no visa applicant would've gotten approved and the school's repute probably helped too) and our organization, which would've had to assume all legal and monetary obligations if the visa applicant would overstay his welcome. That effectively meant me and another person who was the president.

However this was just one of roughly 10 requirements they had to meet to be granted a visa. Naturally the embassies called to verify the authenticity of the letters, they had to provide bank statements in excess of 5.000€ on top of the regular stuff: certification of being a student (from the desk of the university chancellor), one personal interview which basically consisted of nothing but verifying personal data and acting like a dick to them to scare their possible nasty overstay thoughts away, and one more visit to the embassy (even if they lived hundreds of kms away) and such. Some country-specific requirements were in place as well, Egyptian students had to prove they aren't bailing the country to avoid military service with a government waiver for example. 

It was a hassle for me but I had huge respect for the exchange students who acted really casually when describing this process. And naturally on top of this all, being from countries like Egypt and Ghana, even Hungarian prices were expensive for them and they had to miss out on some programs simply because they couldn't afford it :/

Oh, and all of this was of course a bit of a loophole in the system as I was informed over the phone by embassy employees, the regular tourist visa application is supposed to be even more scrutinous.

In giro poi c'è una statistica riguardo le morti neonatali che dopo il 1991 ebbe un picco improvviso per la scarsa assistenza medica e l'incapacità di un a famiglia a reperire risorse per il sostentamento.

Putin invece cominciò a nazionalizzare i settori chiave, usando mano ferma (e dunque usando delle lievi limitazioni delle libertà) per far riprendere l'economia stabilizzando la crisi e ora  la Russia si è allontanata dai livelli degli anni '90 e non saranno ricchi come l'occidente ma quantomeno si riesce a vivere e hanno potere d'acquisto sufficiente per il sostentamento, e il consenso che ha Putin dai suoi cittadini è genuino per aver fatto uscire il paese da quella crisi nera, oltre che economica, anche politica.

Hass. Die Typen sollten sterben. Besser früher als später. 

Verleugnung. Vielleicht ist das gar nicht wahr, oder wird übertrieben. Wer hat einen Nutzen davon? Ich wehre mich seit Jahren gegen die Entmenschlichung des ""Gegners"" - soviel sollte man als Deutscher aus dem Geschichtsunterricht mitgenommen haben. Aber jetzt denke ich: Die müssen weg. Den Gedanken will ich mir aber nicht ernsthaft erlauben, also denke ich: Das ist alles nicht wahr. Propaganda, um die Pazifisten weichzukochen.

Ratlosigkeit. Ursachensuche. Das Öl, das hat die ganze Region zerstört. Ein Fluch, im Nachhinein. Die Radikalisisierung dort hat viele Gründe, hauptsächlich wirtschaftliche. Die radikale Auslegung des Islam ist nur ein Mittel zum Zweck, ein Kristallationspunkt oder ein spiritueller Überbau, unter dem sich der ganze Hass der Verlierer dieser Welt sammelt. Und dazu kommt: Ein Ort, an den permanent Waffen geliefert werden müssen - mal an die eine, mal an die andere Partei - ist ein wahrer Goldesel für manche. 

Hinterher ist man schlauer. Was nicht heisst, dass man die Fehler nicht wiederholt. Keine Ahnung. Die Menschheit ist nichts als ein ekliger Ausschlag der Erde.

Jahrelang bedrogt Aggro-Rap machen. Lebenskrise, Enttäuschung, Alles-Anders-Machen, ins andere Extrem kippen. Neuer Kick gesucht. Bingo, Köpfe abschneiden. So stell ich mir das vor. 

Aber aus der Vogelperspektive kommt es mir dann alles ganz logisch vor. Der Kapitalismus (so abgedroschen es klingt) produziert Ungleichheiten in immer größerem Ausmaße, und dieser Prozess verläuft technologiegestützt exponentiell. Die zunehmende Vernetzung der Weltgesellschaft kommt mir ein wenig so vor, als bilde sich langsam aus vielen Zellen ein Organismus. Irgendwann wurden wir vom Tier zum Menschen, wurden immer freier von unmittelbaren Instinkten, aus ""Gruppenverbünden"" wurden Ansammlungen von freien Individuen, Aufklärung, dachten, dass es immer so weiter geht, aber jetzt werden wir langsam zu kleinen Zellen eines Megaorganismus. Und irgendwo muss dieser Megaorganismus seinen Dickdarm und sein Arschloch haben. Man sagt, Strukturen gehen nicht auf die Straße. Führen Strukturen Krieg?

&gt;""The Americans promised that Nato wouldn't move beyond the boundaries of Germany after the Cold War but now half of central and eastern Europe are members, so what happened to their promises? It shows they cannot be trusted."" Gorbachev

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/1933223/Gorbachev-US-could-start-new-Cold-War.html

&gt;The Revolutions of 1989 and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in 1991 removed the de facto main adversary of NATO and caused a strategic re-evaluation of NATO's purpose, nature, tasks, and their focus on the continent of Europe. This shift started with the 1990 signing in Paris of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe between NATO and the Soviet Union, which mandated specific military reductions across the continent that continued after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991.[41] At that time, European countries accounted for 34% of NATO's military spending; by 2012, this had fallen to 21%.[42] NATO also began a gradual expansion to include newly autonomous Eastern European nations, and extended its activities into political and humanitarian situations that had not formerly been NATO concerns

&gt;The first post-Cold War expansion of NATO came with German reunification on 3 October 1990, when the former East Germany became part of the Federal Republic of Germany and the alliance. This had been agreed in the Two Plus Four Treaty earlier in the year. To secure Soviet approval of a united Germany remaining in NATO, it was agreed that foreign troops and nuclear weapons would not be stationed in the east, and there are diverging view on whether negotiators gave commitments regarding further NATO expansion east. Jack Matlock, U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union during its final years, said that the West gave a ""clear commitment"" not to expand, and declassified documents indicate that Soviet negotiators were given the impression that NATO membership was off the table for countries such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary, or Poland.[43] In May 2008, Gorbachev repeated his view that ""the Americans promised that NATO wouldn't move beyond the boundaries of Germany after the Cold War.""[44] According to Robert Zoellick, a State Department official involved in the Two Plus Four negotiating process, this appears to be a misperception, and no formal commitment regarding enlargement was made.[45]

true,King_of_Avalon,EURO,Croatia,"It's damn near impossible even for well-educated people. It can vary a bit from one country to the next, but in general, it's not easy to immigrate to the EU as a degree-holding American/Canadian than it is a poor farmer from Sudan (most Europeans seem to be astonished when they learn that people from the US/Canada/Aus/NZ get absolutely no special privileges above anyone from Africa aside from visa-free tourism). Right now, Europe is remarkably difficult to get into in general.

I'll take the UK for example. If you want to work, you've got a few options. First, you can work for at least two years in your home country that has an office in the UK. Then, you can apply to transfer to the UK branch. If for whatever reason they agree to the request, you can get an intra-company transferee visa that lasts for a few years. Generally, unless you have a highly specialised skill that's almost absent in the local market, this visa tends to be used almost entirely by senior management.

The next option is to straight up be sponsored for a work permit after applying for a job vacancy. This requires: around £1000 for the employer to sign up to the register of sponsors, that requires a vetting of your HR systems and some background checks on key HR personnel. Then, another £400 or so for the certificate of sponsorship. In order to get this, you have to prove that no UK/EU citizen applied who was equally as qualified. In order to do this, you must show that the job was posted in the local Jobcentre Plus for several weeks at a minimum, allowing the largest possible number of people to apply. 

After that, the applicant can apply for a sponsored Tier 2 visa. Part of the requirements would be the salary, which is typically pegged around the average yearly wage, perhaps slightly below. I think it's around £21000 at the moment, but might have changed. This is to discourage people from applying for 'unskilled' positions.

You must give your fingerprints in person at an overseas mission. The entire process takes several months. At this point, I don't know a single person in the UK right now on a Tier 2 visa. All are either students or spouses. And I should add - what company in this day and age hires someone from across oceans based entirely on phone/Skype calls? Businesses have been minimising risk since 2007, and hiring people from outside of the labour market sight unseen has basically stopped.

Alternatively, you can marry someone from that country. This means that you do not benefit from the EU/EEA residence card, and must go through normal immigration channels. For the UK, this requires a compulsory English test, proof of substantial income on the part of the British spouse sponsoring their partner (and *only* the British spouse - any financial interests and job offers for the non-British spouse don't count). The requirements at the moment for Brits to sponsor spouses are so onerous that I know two people who now live in separate countries because their British partners (all young) didn't have tens of thousands of pounds in liquid assets for the application sponsorship. That particular route is absolutely draconian at the moment.

Or you could be a student, which is a lot like going through job sponsorship although not as difficult, just long and costly. You can work 20 hours per week during term time, and 40 hours per week during holidays. At the end of your course, you must leave the UK. There is no longer a post-study work option - it was eliminated a few years ago.

There's also a few family reunification visas, mainly concerning dependant minors and elderly relatives (preferably who live alone). I'm not as familiar with these because they've never applied. There are also a handful of options available to remarkably wealthy people with millions in liquid assets ready to spend a hefty chunk of that within the country.

And that's pretty much it. If you head over to /r/IWantOut, where people dole out immigration advice, look at all the US-&gt;UK request threads and read just how brutal the advice is.  Now this does vary from one country to the next (for example, most European countries do still have post-study work options and less evil spouse visa rules than the UK), but it's still rather dismal all around. It's much easier to get in to get married to an EU citizen, and then move to *another* EU country that's not your spouse's, since that gets you an EU/EEA residence card which is pretty much a free ride.

By far, pretty much your best hope to get to Europe legally is to work for a major multinational company for a few years and try to get a transfer to Europe. The good old days of being let in simply for being from a western power, having a western degree or being married to a citizen just don't work any more. That started to die after 2001, and was extinguished along with the economy after 2007.

true,ThunderstruckGER,EURO,Europa,"&gt;Ich bin einfach etwas dünnhäutig gegenüber Polemik bei Themen, die mir wichtig sind, egal ob sie für oder gegen meinen Standpunkt spricht.

Gehe Ich richtig in der Annahme, dass diese Dünnhäutigkeit überbrückt wurde durch die Darlegung was nun tatsächlich hinter meiner Polemik gesteckt hat - und was meine Motive sind? Diesbezüglich möchte Ich dir halt einfach mal empfehlen, lockerer zu werden. Denn wie du siehst, kann ja dann doch relativ viel hinter einer oberflächlich betrachtet plumpen Bemerkung stecken. Wie die Leute das Anpacken ist ja schließlich immer eine Frage der Muße und verfügbaren Zeit.

&gt;Provoziert oft negative Emotionen auch da, wo man sie nicht intendiert hat. Ist zur Abwehr geeignet oder zur Identitätsstabilisierung, steht aber dem ""Erkenntnisgewinn"" und dem konstruktiven Dialog im Weg. 

Das kann man durchaus so stehen lassen. Aber weil Ich ein unverbesserlicher Relativierer bin, will ich darauf hinweisen, dass alles aufgeführte durch Polemik geschehn kann, aber nicht muss - je nach Dosierung und die Art der Polemik. Du kannst ja eher zynisch bis sarkastisch polemisch sein, oder eben richtig bösartig. Es kommt einfach auf die Verwendung und den Kontext an.

Außerdem: Es ist doch schön wenn du dich der Wahheitsfindung verschreibst, das ist ein ambitioniertes Ziel und erfordert sehr viel Hartnäckigkeit, Sorgfalt und Zeit. Aber es wird wahrscheinlich sehr oft sehr schnell in irgendeiner Sackgasse enden. Ich will außerdem darauf hinaus, dass /r/de dafür auch nicht der beste Sub ist. Alleine von der Sinngebung nicht. Afaik waren wir uns doch in einem andern Thread einig, dass da entsprechende, hervorragende philosophische/wissenschaftliche Subreddits existieren.

Jedenfalls,  /r/de, das musst du verstehen, ist ein Hybrid aus dem Unterhaltungscharakter von Reddit, dem Wahrheitsfindungsanspruch und dem Element der Streitgespräche. Diese Streitgespräche *können* der Wahrheitsfindung dienen und tun das hier ja oft, bzw man kann in ihnen eben das vertreten, was man als die Wahrheit oder der Wahrheit am Nächsten ansieht, aber das ist nicht immer der Fall. Es geht nun auch mal was daneben, das finde Ich menschlich, auch -und insbesondere- dort, wo ein Übergang zb zu einer ""Rechthaberei"" vorhanden sein kann. Das hat was mit der gewissen, natürlichen, menschlichen Eitelkeit und dem Grad der Festigung des Weltbildes, bzw  des Grads der Vielfalt des Voranschreitens des Gedankenprozesses zum Thema zu tun. Das passiert mir sicher auch das ein oder andere Mal und wohl sogar beiläufig ohne es unmittelbar zu merken. Da fallen einem dann erst sehr viel später in Retrospektive kleine Fehler und beiläufige Formulierungen auf, die einem aber auch offensichtlich bis zu einem gewissen Grad verziehen werden.

Wie gesagt: Bleib locker wenn der Informationsaustausch abstrakt und/oder restringiert, oder auch einfach nur ruppig ist und denk kurz über den Kontext nach. Wir sind hier im Internet. Wenn dich mal was anpisst, mach keinen Hehl daraus, aber frag bei Interesse o.ä. erstmal ganz normal nach, was dahinter steckt. Das wäre mein Rat zu dem Thema. Dann hätte ich dir zb ganz trocken meine Sicht auf den Zustand der kämpfenden Parteien in der Ostukraine wiedergegeben.

- Alien &gt; **Alien – Das unheimliche Wesen aus einer fremden Welt** (the creepy creature from a foreign world)
- The Man Who Knew Too Little &gt; **Agent Null Null Nix - Bill Murray in hirnloser Mission** (Agent Zero Zero Nothing - Bill Murray on brainless mission)
- Lethal Weapon 4 &gt; **Lethal Weapon 4 - Zwei Profis räumen auf** (Two professionals tidy up)
- The Cable Guy &gt; **Cable Guy - Die Nervensäge** (the 'nuisance'/annoying person)


Super inconsisten titles:

- Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl &gt; **Fluch der Karibik** (Curse of the Caribbean) = Main title &amp; subtitle condensed
- Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest &gt; **Pirates of the Caribbean - Fluch der Karibik 2** = English original series title + Condensed title of previous entry + ""2""
- Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End &gt; **Pirates of the Caribbean - Am Ende der Welt** = English original series title + translated subtitle + no number


You also gotta love it when they 'translate' english to 'english for germans'. Somehow happens often with 'girl' titles. 

- Bring it on &gt; **Girls United**
- Mean Girls &gt; **Girls Club**
- View from the Top &gt; **Flight Girls - Blondinen im Anflug** (Blondes on approach)
- Horrible Bosses &gt; **Kill the Boss**
- Taken &gt; **96 Hours**
- Cradle to Grave &gt; **Born 2 Die**
- Cellular &gt; **Final Call - Wenn er auflegt, muss sie sterben!** (If he hangs up, she must die!)
- Thor: The Dark World &gt; **Thor: The Dark Kingdom**
- Captain America: The Winter Soldier &gt; **The Return of the First Avenger**

If the goal is straight up communication, youll be understood 99% of the time even when you mess up (context is king.) If the goal is correctness, then ask to be corrected. 

The only way to learn is to learn. And, once you make a certain mistake in a conversation and are corrected, thatll likely stick with you better than memorizing gender from a book.

I remember learning that the old religious scholars who did much to standardize German are responsible for die Erde being feminine (women give birth as the earth gives life), and in their worldview the heavens were manly (der Himmel, der Gott, etc.) It then always struck me as surprising that they didnt make the universe (das  All) masculine as well.

Of course there was a lot of anger by public sector workers that in 1998 the Left/communist party got a record 12% of votes.

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_general_election,_1998


But eventually this paid off when in 2008, that sweden did not had to undergo harsh budget cutsthat many PIIGS countries did because the swedes after a harsh recession in early 90s decided to *live within their means*.

And eventually that and the factor that the swedes had their own currency allowed a quick rebound from the crisis.

Precisely. That's my whole point about it being the best deterrent. If Ukraine had nuclear weapons, we'd be 100% certain that this conflict will remain localized and that Russia will not attempt to ""seize Kiev in two weeks"" unless its leader has suicidal tendencies.

Obviously it is not panacea, so having a large conventional force is likewise important. One of the biggest reasons why Ukraine is a ""weaker nation which needs alliances"" is that it has no nukes. Likewise, a rich Germany and Japan are also ""weaker nations which need alliances"", and could go a long way toward fixing that by getting even a single nuke.

true,zrodion,null,null,"State Duma deputy Roman Khudyakov (LDPR) sent a letter to the head of the Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin to provide available to the investigation materials concerning the repeated attacks on Russian territory in the Rostov region on the part of Ukraine. As a result of the shelling, which occur regularly in recent months, are dead, injured, property damaged by the Russians and their lives are a constant threat. Materials will be used for the preparation of a claim to Ukrainian authorities on the $ 1 billion in international courts. If you win, the money will be spent on compensation for damage to Russian citizens. 

A $ 1 billion legislator considers adequate, based on the number of victims and the fact that the lives of thousands of Russian citizens have been threatened because of fire from a neighboring country. 

Another projectile flew from Ukraine, exploded on September 4 near the checkpoint ""Voloshino"" Rostov region. Prior to that, the border areas were regularly subjected to shelling from the Ukraine as artillery and small arms fire. In August, there were repeatedly shelling, in particular in the area of ​​PPC ""Gukovo"" or village Kujbyshevo, and some of them had the opportunity to see the representatives of the OSCE. Until August, according to the government of the Rostov region, Russia's territory 16 times the shelling, which resulted in one death and nine were wounded. A large number of citizens was property damage. 

At the same time, as noted by Roman Khudiakov fighters Ukrainian destroyer battalions differ russophobia and chauvinism and it could fire on the territory of Russia is not in error, but purposefully. 

- Our territory is shelled regularly. There are dead and wounded, many material damage. Neighboring state should be responsible for these crimes, and the international community to give their assessment of such actions. In this case, we have reason to believe that the attacks were carried out purposefully - said Hudyakov. - In the National Guard battalions en masse are radicals, has a strong anti-Russian sentiments. They committed many crimes against civilians, including in Ukraine killed four Russian journalists. 

After receiving the investigative materials on firing Russian legislator would like to work with the victims and with the support of the authorities to prepare a lawsuit in international courts to Ukraine by $ 1 billion, which will be compensated by Russian citizens who have suffered from the actions of the Ukrainian authorities. 

In most of the Rostov region told ""Izvestia"" that Ukrainian Rockets continue to burst in Russia. 

- During the period of the conflict at different times were shelling, causing harm to the residential buildings. Mostly injuries were recorded in the region of Donetsk (city with 50 thousand population in the Rostov region of Russia. - ""Proceedings""), Kuibyshev district center, near the hamlet of Kherson, 2 km from Millerovo - told the FSB Border Guard directorate in the Rostov region . - In July, in the region of Donetsk during the shelling killed one man. 

Member of the State Duma Defense Committee and a native of Rostov region Vladimir Bessonov said that after the attacks, the region needs support. 

- Some time ago, residents of border areas were in a state of panic, although it is now, in my opinion, the tension eased a little. And now we need to take swift action to restore the local character of certain areas of the economy to have fallen into the epicenter of these events settlements. For example, animal husbandry should be revived. In general, to breathe life into the economy of these settlements, - he said. 

The head of the Moscow Bar Andrei Knyazev said that in the case of the firing of Russia has the right to demand justice through international courts. 

- If Ukraine recognizes the validity of the charges, of course, win the court will be easier, and otherwise process runs the risk of delayed so long as the legal costs can be more expensive compensation - said the lawyer. - In the case of the downed plane Ukrainian army in 2001, it lasted 7 years. But in general, in the case of such attacks and assassinations of course we have the right to demand justice through international lawsuits. 

Confrontation in the east of Ukraine between the militias and the Kiev troops continued for several months. The reason for a military confrontation that killed according to various sources for about 2.5 thousand. Lives, became a coup in Kiev in February this year and the emergence of the power structures of nationalist politicians calling eradicate Russian-speaking population of Ukraine.

Well, not every nuke is a doomsday device. Battlefield tactical nukes are a huge escalation, but not in themselves suicidal. Which means that the threshold of their use is lower, and the likelihood of their use by a desperate army is higher. Which means - don't make that army too desperate.

&gt;On a slightly different note, it's also more people employed in the military.

In the 21st century, the number of people or tanks and other clunky hardware matter quite a bit less. In this conflict they seem to matter because both Russian and Ukrainian armies are outdated, but in a conflict with a modern force Russians would lose ten times the amount of tanks and be able to inflict far less damage. Just look at the Iraq War to see what a modern army can do when engaged in a conventional conflict against an outdated army. Beyond 10-20k elite troops (and by that I mean on par with average US troops), Russians would differ from Iraqis just in terms of there being more juicy targets to pick out.

As for your faith in NATO, the problem with such alliances between democratic states is that people by their very nature are fickle, prone to propaganda and active measures campaigns, and often err on the side of pacifism. If you're 100% certain that NATO will honour its article 5 commitment in case Russia starts a Donbass-style hybrid war in Estonia, I envy your optimism. I am not so certain. Which is why it would make sense for the Baltic countries to collectively have one single nuke pointed at Moscow.

Ukraine is no Georgia however. All that already takes months and it is much closer to the EU borders. Also Eastern European countries have both more to lose and are more influential than in the time of Georgia.

Not nearly influential enough tho, as it seems. By now there are really two or three options. 

We could send NATO forces in some capacity or at least provide air strikes against rebels. That's probably the only chance for this conflict to end with Kiev government regaining the control over it's territory. Putin would bitch, moan and tell stories about bad, bad West, but would also use his handy ""There are no Russians in Ukraine"" card to save some face. He's rallied voters to the standard so most important part of the whole plan would have been successful anyway.
That was option 1.
 

If West will stick to sanctions or even move to arming Ukraine it won't help one bit and UA army will be crushed within weeks, if not worse. Putin will either try to carve out Eastern Ukraine (most likely) or will try to take the whole country as a puppet state. 

If first then he will be allowed to do so and we'll simply get Georgian situation. 

If he will try to take Kiev and beyond things may get very hot very fast. My university buddy works as an analyst for Center of Eastern Studies think-tank here in Warsaw. It is one of the centres that provides analyses and suggestions for the government. I've been nagging him for months for some inside knowledge and while he wasn't able to tell me much from what I understand direct and immediate danger for Kiev is seen as a breaking point for Polish policy in this conflict. In that case we may break rank as a NATO and EU member (like we would have till that point) and send forces into Ukraine in order to prevent an advance on its capital while bilaterally seeking assistance and guarantees from possible allies.

*la diada* is about independende, if possible through a referendum good, if not through unilateral declaration. It means the ANC goes for a separate state whether there's a majority that wants it or not. That's **NOT** democratic, even if there's a majority that might want it. Do you understand that? If it doesn't matter for them to have a vote, they're equally democratic as the central government... nil.

&gt;For the people nothing will change? Well, you won't have a state against you.

Don't be annoying. I have nothing against a Catalan state. I have something against taking that decision without a vote. Your nationalism is nothing different from the idiots in Madrid, you want to deny a vote. There's only one way to find out, and that's voting. *La diada* has nothing to do with that.

Let me repeat, I have nothing against an independent Catalunya, but in a democracy it's a people's vote, not a decision taken in Madrid, nor in Barcelona. The ANC is not a democratic platform, even if they represent many people here.

&gt; Really, I don't know where you come from or where do you get your information from. On 11S there's no voting!

Demanding independence is different from asking for a referendum. I can't understand you don't understand that difference. 11S bad, 9N good. How do you want me to explain it more clearly?

And, *theoretically* again, companies are supposed to use this only to counter a passing low in orders, not when they are in a death spiral, but I know at least of one technically insolvent company which has launched several successive ERTEs to save itself the redundancy payments, so that there are some actives left for the lenders.

A German pronounces w as /v/ (*voiced* labio-dental fricative,) though, whereas the English pronounce w as a [voiced labio-velar approximant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labio-velar_approximant).

So whereas the English would read ""work"" as [wɜːk], a heavy German accent pronounces it as [vœɐkʰ].

So we usually do that and chat, like in a pub. There are some places we call ""pubs"" that go for the English/Irish pub look, are more beer-centered and usually don't care much about aperitivo. I like them, but they might be disappointing from an Irish perspective. I'm not sure. Then there's the whole dancing scene, to which I'm oblivious. Nightlife is centered around ""navigli"", the old waterways designed by Leonardo da Vinci himself, but you can find good places anywhere.

Pizza here is good, but very few places make it Naples-good.

I'm not very much into art or history so, as I suspected, I can't advise you well. But that's one kind of information that should be easy to find on the Internet or tourist information points. Also, if you like gothic churches, Duomo is awesome.

Last Supper: I've never seen it, but it should be possible.

Maybe you'll be luckier than me.

Keep in mind that very few people speak English well (or at all). Also, people from Milan are weary of people approaching them (scammers and beggars abound), so asking for directions is harder and you'll need to find the right person. Looking like a tourist might actually help.

Bread is 50-75 cents (generally about 500 grams). 

The absolute cheapest low quality hot dogs are about 2 dollars a kilo. Ground meat, not sure, but if I had to guess, around 4 dollars a kilo. If you want real meat, pork goes from 6-10 dollars a kilo. 

A dozen eggs, are be a bit less than 2 dollars, depending on size, maybe even a little cheaper. 

A 1.5 l bottle of beer goes from 1.7-2.5 dollars. A bottle of wine from 2 dollars. A somewhat decent wine goes from at least 5 dollars for 0.7 l. 

Fruits and vegetables are very cheap when they're in season, but the price goes up at least 2-3 times out of season. The prices change on a daily basis, so I can't tell you exactly.

People should just use the public transport to get to work, but whenever you drive, because you like driving as a hobby in order to express your manhood, then it would be a 3000 cc diesel engine roaring.

true,VincentClebard,ZZZZZZchiot,Chiot,"&gt; Intéressant certes, mais finalement ta ""classe dominante"" existe sous cette forme dans tous les pays qui disposent d'un gouvernement, d'une administration, d'une presse, d'entreprises et de partis politiques... c'est à dire dans quasiment tous les pays. C'est pas un peu enfoncer une porte ouverte tout ça? 

Je ne disais rien d'exceptionnel. Je faisais juste le constat que Marine Le Pen n'appartenait pas à cette classe dominante, qui se définit autrement que ""j'ai de l'argent"". Apparemment, ce n'était pas évident pour tout le monde.

Donc avant de dire ""Marine Le Pen est extérieure à ces milieux"", il faut définir ""ces milieux"".

&gt; Dans ce cas, Cahuzac, Sarkozy, Tiberi, Chirac, Dumas, Carignon, Woerth etc.. qui faisaient partie du ""système"" puisque députés, ministres ou maires, ont dû rire particulièrement jaune non? 

L'existence d'une classe dominante ou de plusieurs champs sociaux dans lesquels des acteurs se retrouvent entre eux n'impliquent pas une absence de luttes entre eux.

En gros, c'est comme si tu disais : ""l'université française n'est pas un milieu social assez remarquable pour qu'on puisse le traiter comme un objet sociologique. Ben oui : j'ai vu des universitaires débattre entre eux et ne pas être d'accord !""

Que des journalistes fassent un boulot qui mettent des bâtons dans les roues de certains hommes politiques, chefs d'entreprise, intellectuels médiatiques, etc. c'est une chose. Que *le journalisme* ou une classe médiatique ne soit pas intimement liée aux milieux ""à pouvoir"", s'en est une autre. 

C'est aussi comme si tu me soulignais qu'il n'existe pas de ""classe dominante"" dans notre pays, issue d'écoles proches (ou des mêmes écoles) participant à des mécanismes de reproduction sociale fort, pouvant se renvoyer l'ascenseur assez naturellement, disposant de codes implicites dans la bienséance qu'ils doivent avoir entre eux, etc. parce que tu connais un petit élu qui fait super bien son boulot et refuse de participer à tous ces trucs.",0,1409904922,null,0,false,0,ck9qwb8,t3_2ffxu7,t1_ck9qwb8,t1_ck9fzhf,null,1427187173,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

And that's bad. But if they started treating gay people fairly, that would just be them doing what they are supposed to do, not something exceptional. 

I never suggested that gay people shouldn't be afforded their human rights,  i dont see how you can misunderstand me so wildly. 

Regardless, britain is not particularly a bastion of human rights, even though we do legally treat gays appropriately, there's plenty of places where uk law is not up to standard, and being better than the shittiest countries in the world is irrelevant,  we're not supposed to infringe human rights. You don't deserve praise for not doing bad things.

People's standards for this country are too low. Stop comparing us with backwater shitholes with laws from the dark ages. That's not the measure you should be satisfied with meeting, it's the absolute minimum you should demand.

So no, fuck you, not me. Fuck you for throwing your sexuality around like it makes your opinion right on unrelated matters, as a straight person with considered ethical standards,  fuck you. Fuck you for being complacent and accepting the status quo and not demanding more, not demanding that our government do what it should. Your attitude is exactly the problem, you dont critically examine what the government does unless it suits you. You don't give a shit about the country,  you're just looking out for yourself. 

It's fine to be proud of britain, but not for simply not infringing some basic rights. Dont give politicians such an easy free pass, they don't deserve it, we don't deserve it.

true,matart91,veneto,null,"Sono utente Airbnb da circa 1 anno e posso contare all'incirca 4 esperienze in quattro paesi diversi:  

* **Francia, Parigi:** Prima esperienza, ho pagato all'incirca 50€ (totali per 2 notti e 2 persone!) per l'affitto di una stanza a 15 minuti di metro dalla Tour Eiffel. Sono partito molto timoroso e sono tornato a casa super soddisfatto in quanto i proprietari erano gentilissimi, la stanza era pulitissima e dotata di tutto (wifi compreso), avevamo le chiavi di casa (logic) ed eravamo liberi di utilizzare bagno e cucina a nostro piacimento.  

* **Italia, Verona:** Ho prenotato all'ultimo e non ho prestato attenzione alle recensioni e alle foto presenti. Abbiamo optato per un appartamento completo (non solo camera) e ce la siamo cavata con 45€ per una notte. Il monolocale in se era carino...il problema è che si trovava due piani sottoterra (taverna trasformata in mini appartamento), senza finestre, con una stufa a gas per scaldarsi (immaginavo già di finire nella cronaca nera) e ogni tanto giravano scorpioni qua e la. 
Sicuramente la ""peggiore"" tra le 4 esperienze ma è stata in buona parte colpa mia che non ho prestato abbastanza attenzione all'annuncio.  

* **Belgio, Bruxelles:**  Eravamo a 50m dalla stazione della metro, in zona universitaria e ospitati da una famiglia Vietnamita di 3 persone che dormiva in salotto. Abbiamo pagato anche li sui 50€ totali per due notti, era tutto pulito, loro gentilissimi e disponibilissimi e non possiamo certo lamentarci!  

* **Croazia, Pola:** Airbnb in questo caso è stata la nostra salvezza perchè siamo riusciti ad affittare un trilocale super accessoriato (Wifi, Aria condizionata, Tv satellitare ecc) a solo 400€ per una settimana, quando ad Agosto un ~~loculo~~ monolocale senza AC costa in media 450-500€ a settimana (prezzi delle agenzie).  
Anche qui il proprietario è stato gentilissimo e ci ha fornito un sacco di consigli che solo un residente può darti.  

In definitiva consiglio Airbnb a coloro che:  

* **Vogliono risparmiare -&gt;** Trovatemi un hotel decente a 15 minuti dal centro di Parigi che costi 50€ per due notti e 2 persone...ecco perchè ho scelto Airbnb.  

* **Avere un contatto con i ""locali"" -&gt;** Subito non avevo prestato attenzione a questo punto ma vivere a ""stretto contatto"" con la popolazione del posto significa ricevere numerosi consigli che permettono di risparmiare e di scoprire al meglio il posto che si sta visitando.  

Invece sconsiglio Airbnb:  

* **A chi non sa cercare su internet -&gt;** Su Airbnb c'è di tutto, dallo squallido monolocale senza finestre al fantastico appartamento con piscina. Imparate ad usare la funzione cerca e prestate attenzione alla posizione dell'appartamento, in caso contrario andate in hotel.  

* **Alle persone troppo timide -&gt;** La mia fidanzata è molto timida e alla prima esperienza si sentiva molto imbarazzata a stare a stretto contatto con degli sconosciuti conosciuti da 2 minuti. E' una cosa che non mi tocca personalmente ma posso comprendere che farsi la doccia a casa di sconosciuti possa far sentire in imbarazzo molti.  

* **Alle persone che cercano servizi da 5 stelle -&gt;** Siete a casa degli altri, non in un hotel da 5 stelle con la suite. Costa poco e offre lo stretto necessario per viaggiatori da ""zaino in spalla e cartina"", se non siete intraprendenti e volete il ""pane fatto"" consiglio di affidarvi ad un'agenzia turistica.

It's partly that but don't only assume it's party politics, the British public have been lied to concerning referendums on the EU and ""doing something"" about high immigration rates which are not matching Cameron's Election pledge of&lt;100,000 net pa.

This reflects the negative view of the public as much as it does UKIP's agenda or policies.

2. Immigration net pa current = 235,000
3. Polls 77% public want lower immigration
4. Rotherham and 1400 abused children mainly of Kashmiri/Pashtun perpetrators (aka political correctness in the local authority)

Why go to Germany and expect there to be American cheeses?

You can get an almost decent English or Irish cheddar at Lidl from time to time, but it didn't really catch on in Germany so it's not always stocked. Lidl's ""English week"" basically failed, as what was on offer was either stuff you can get in Germany anyhow (why buy something called ""apple sauce"" when you can get it cheaper as ""Apfelmus""?), stuff Germans don't see the point of (what's so special about malt vinegar?), or stuff Germans generally didn't want to even risk trying (mint sauce). In the big cities you may have more luck.

From reading the article it does feel like a plausible analysis of why things have happened the way they have. The issue I have with this analysis though, is that I feel it downplays other factors, such as the military strategic importance of the Crimean warm water port. If I had to judge I'd argue that seizing Crimea is mostly explained as based on military strategic reasons and opportunity, but however that the positive effect it had on Putins popularity might explain his continued escalation in the rest of the eastern Ukraine.


The problem I have with this analysis though, is that the premise of it is that Putin cares more about staying in power of Russia, than he cares about Russia - unless of course he believes that him staying in power equals succes for Russia.

Another hit at this analysis is that Putin might understand the current situation as one that is a trade-off, where the current economic sanctions are a short-term negative for Russia, whereas the annexation of rich/important land is a long-term gain, which in time as sanctions are lifted, will turn out to be a net gain for Russia.

There has been a lot of conversation surrounding this very topic so I will be brief. 


To let the alliances made by NATO to be discredited by Putin, would be, in all probability his goal. While he very well may be crazy in his nationalistic fervor he is not stupid. He knows if he was to go to war with NATO that Russia's military wouldn't stand a chance. 

Action on the part of NATO would not be an incursion into Russia, but rather to repel an incoming offensive. 

Putin may very well seek to discredit NATO by trying to push the bounds in an effort to see how far NATO will go. But if NATO was to break their promise of mutual protection the entire system would quickly fall apart and warring among Eastern European states and Russia would be eminent. Furthermore numerous countries would benefit from this scenario where current alliances keep them in check, namely China and Russia. For example think of Japan, The Philippians, South Korea, and most of Eastern Europe. 


In effect by NATO not responding the end result is only a larger, more complex, and ruinous quagmire globally. I'd like to add I do not accept your corollary; that being protection of the Baltics, or of the alliance, would result in nuclear war. But if that was to be the case (Which is ***highly*** unlikely), Russia would still lose, just having taken most of Europe with him.

Wahlbetrug ist keine Frage der ""Wahrnehmung"":

&gt;In Sevastopol, the largest city in Crimea, turnout for Sunday’s referendum reached an astonishing 123% of registered voters. There may be an explanation for this number that doesn’t involve the simple stuffing of ballot boxes: 

&gt;“One reporter from Kiev showed his Russian passport and was handed a ballot and allowed to vote. This raised questions in Kiev if perhaps the Russian soldiers and Russian paramilitary occupying the area since late February had been allowed to cast votes.

&gt;Before anyone rushes to accept this vote, they might also like to note the most recent poll in Crimea – published last month – showed just 41% wanted unity with Russia. This was a rise of five points in a year, and was taken as the violence flared in Kiev, but it makes it impossible to assume a majority really wanted to join Russia – let alone 97% of the population

If you don't respond to them, it will be handed over to a debt collection agency (""Inkasso"" is the word used in this context), and if you don't respond to that, they'll take out a court order. Fail to respond to that, and there'll be a hearing. Fail to attend the hearing, and you'll be found guilty in your absence. Still fail to pay, and in theory an arrest warrant will be issued and you could spend a few days in jail.

That's the theory. In practice it's likely to go that far only if you're a repeat offender. Just the once, and it will probably be dropped and just be kept on file. But don't rely on that.

Now, in your case, if you've left the country, the post they send to you will probably be returned ""unknown at this address"". If they then check with the authorities, they should see that you're no longer registered as resident in Germany.

That won't necessarily be the end of it though. The statute of limitations on such things is ten years. The details will remain on file for that length of time. If, during that period, you return to Germany, your name and date and birth will be enough to identify you, and you may (or may not) then receive a bill. It will be more than €40, because all sorts of costs will have been added, for which you are liable.

However, if your name has been misspelled, there's a chance the system won't recognise you. Then again, even that's not a given.

Eine Minderheit, die laut deinem Zitat nur 10% der Bevölkerung umfasst, wird selbst bei einem perfekt fairem Referendum aus offensichtlichen Gründen Schwierigkeiten haben, die Bevölkerungsmehrheit zu überstimmen.  Von daher war der Boykott der Serben verständlich.

Was hat das jetzt allerdings mit der Volksabstimmung in der Ukraine zu tun?  Das Referendum im Kosovo war politisch völlig bedeutungslos, wie der Wikipedia-Artikel selber erwähnt:

&gt;The only United Nations member who recognised the Republic of Kosova was Albania, with a resolution recognising the country passed in the Parliament of Albania on 21 October


Was die Abstimmung in Bosnien-Herzegowina betrifft, du lässt bezeichnenderweise den Anlass dafür weg:

&gt;In a session 15 October 1991, the Bosnian Parliament, alarmed by the existence of the RAM Plan, approved the ""Memorandum on Sovereignty"" through the use of a parliamentary movement to reopen parliament after Krajišnik had closed it and after Serb deputies had walked out.

&gt;The RAM Plan, also known as Operation RAM, Brana Plan, or Rampart-91, was a military plan developed over the course of 1990 and finalized in Belgrade, Serbia during a military strategy meeting in August 1991 by a group of senior Serb officers of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and experts from the JNA's Psychological Operations Department. Its purpose was organizing Serbs outside Serbia, consolidating control of the Serbian Democratic Parties (SDS), and preparing arms and ammunition in an effort of establishing a country where ""all Serbs with their territories would live together in the same state."" 

&gt;A separate group of undercover operatives and military officers was charged with the implementation of the plan. These people then undertook numerous actions during the Yugoslav Wars that were later described as ethnic cleansing and genocide.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAM_Plan

&gt;The September 1991 leak alarmed the Bosnian government, which decided to proclaim independence on 15 October. At the time the Croatian War of Independence was in full swing, and Serbian actions in Bosnia mirrored those of the Serbs in Croatia.

*Excuse* me? Look at you:

&gt; To us,, it's quite simple really: learn the language and history and take the citizenship test. If you can't do that then it must mean that you don't really want to be here that much. And if you don't want to be here (and you feel ""persecuted"") then feel free to go live in Russia, they'll welcome you with open arms as they've said many times in the past.

So learning a new language as a child was easy for you. Congratulations. It's not so easy for everybody - and *much* harder for your elders (who you clearly have no respect for, fucking arrogant shit of a kid). Should I shit all over your parents if they don't speak English? I mean it is an English world - but you and I know the older generation in Estonia struggles with English.

Next - most of the Russians that moved to Estonia did not do it out of spite for Estonians. They chose to make the place their home. It is their home! They moved there legitimately and there were no ""Estonian language tests"" when they moved there. Why would they go live in Russia now? Because a new arrogant racist group has risen to power and wants Russians to fuck off? Because of a whole set of new racist laws that discriminate against a settled population? You think you're a good person for this?

Personally you seem just as awful as - if not *more so* than - the communists that annexed Estonia generations ago.

true,Crix83,lurker,,"Wow. Proprio ieri stavo pensando di chiedere quanti giocatori di ruolo e/o di giochi in scatola erano presenti qui su r/Italy

Per capire quali giochi prendere dipende sempre quanti giocatori siete e che tipo di giocatori. Faccio la lista dei giochi in mio possesso o quelli che ho giocato (quelli che mi vengono in mente) cercando di spiegare anche un pò il gioco.

- Wherewolf: In estate con la compagnia del mare (10-25 persone, dipende dal periodo) giochiamo solo a questo. Una sorta di Lupus in Tabula, con più ruoli e più fazioni. La pecca è che essendo ad eliminazione, i primi che ""muoiono"" restano a guardare la partita per ore (e la cosa a volte è quasi più divertente che giocare).

- Il trono di spade. (seconda edizione): Per farla breve, risiko ambientato nel mondo della famosa saga di libri (ancor più famosa grazie alla serie tv), senza la parte della fortuna dovuta al tiro dei dadi. Una partita dura dalle 2 alle 5 ore. Il libretto di istruzioni è di circa 30 pagine.


Oltre ai già citati Bang!, Munchkin e The resistance: avalon posso nominare (come party games e/o filler, quindi giochi veloci o che possono giocare tutti... anche i meno appassionati di giochi):

- C'era una volta
- Si, oscuro signore!
- Mascarade (preso il mese scorso e giocato poco, ma sembra davvero molto carino, devo farci più partite)
- Citadels
- 7 wonders
- Dixit! (se devi acquistarlo prendi la versione Dixit: Odyssey! Giocando con lo stesso gruppo di persone sarai ""obbligato"" a comprare più espansioni e questa scatola prevede dello spazio aggiuntivo per le carte delle espansioni).
- The resistance: coup (filler da 10-15 minuti a partita), facile da spiegare e da giocare, ma non così banale e con un'alta giocabilità.

Ora sto valutando l'acquisto di:
- Splendor
- Camel Up
- Love letter


Bonus: se sei interessato a wherewolf/lupus in tabula c'è un app per android (forse anche per iOS) che ti permette di giocare, basta che ti leggi le regole del gioco da qualche sito e puoi usare l'app per assegnare i ruoli e serve come ottimo supporto ai narratori alle prime armi.",0,1409911770,null,0,false,0,ck9s104,t3_2fhfwv,t1_ck9s104,t3_2fhfwv,null,1427186575,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

No. The purpose of the investigation by the Dutch Safety Board is not to determine whodunnit. It is an aircraft accident investigation conducted as per the ICAO procedures. According to the Dutch investigation board the preliminary report will be published Tuesday 9 September 2014 08:00 hours UTC: http://www.onderzoeksraad.nl/en/onderzoek/2049/investigation-crash-mh17-17-july-2014

The available data related to the investigation has been given to the parties participating to the investigation - such as the contents of the black boxes, and the ATC recordings. The data is confidential and will not be published. Nothing exceptional in that as they never are. Publishing it would be in breach of the agreed upon code of conduct as defined in [the ICAO Annex 13 - Incident reporting, data systems and information exchange](http://www.icao.int/safety/ism/ICAO%20Annexes/Forms/AllItems.aspx). 

The *results* of the investigation will be published, and the preliminary report is expected early September. It is common for the investigation to take its time until the final report is ready. Sometimes that may take even years. The ICAO recommendation is:  
&gt; 6.6 Recommendation.— The State conducting the investigation should release the Final Report in the shortest possible time and, if possible, within twelve months of the date of the occurrence. If the report cannot be released within twelve months, the State conducting the investigation should release an interim report on each anniversary of the occurrence, detailing the progress of the investigation and any safety issues raised.

So, do not expect (or as Russia has done, demand) for the black box or ATC recordings to get published. They never are. Sometimes only relevant snippets of those have been published as text - not the recordings themselves. And those snippets have been published with the results in due time. In some rare cases some snippets may have been leaked before the results, but that is very rare and as a breach of code of conduct may compromise the investigation.

It is important to keep in mind what the Dutch Safety Board is investigating and what is the purpose of its investigation (or actually [the three investigations](http://www.onderzoeksraad.nl/en/onderzoek/2049/investigation-crash-mh17-17-july-2014) they have opened).

As per ICAO Annex 13 the purpose of the investigation is:
&gt; A process conducted for the purpose of accident prevention which includes the gathering and analysis of information, the drawing of conclusions, including the determination of causes and, when appropriate, the making of safety recommendations.

**Apportioning blame, such as who shot the missile, is NOT the purpose of the DSB investigation:**
&gt; 3.1 The sole objective of the investigation of an accident or incident shall be the prevention of accidents and incidents. It is not the purpose of this activity to apportion blame or liability.  
&gt;..  
&gt; 5.4.1 Recommendation.— Any judicial or administrative proceedings to apportion blame or liability should be separate from any investigation conducted under the provisions of this Annex.

For that purpose there is separate judicial criminal investigations by Dutch prosecutor office, by Ukrainian prosecutor, and by other relevant judicial authorities too. 

Therefore, do not expect the MH17 accident investigation report, preliminary or final, to contain much anything regarding whodunnit. The whodunnit investigations are separate and handled by the appropriate judicial authorities. For example, the Dutch prosecutor office has opened an investigation for suspected 298 murders.",0,1409911954,null,0,1409912490,0,ck9s26w,t3_2firh4,t1_ck9s26w,t1_ck9r8xb,null,1427186559,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

Il problema non è il calo fisiologico della popolazione, il problema è il rapporto fra cittadini in età produttiva e non. Se 5 giovani devono mantenere 30 vecchi è ovvio che non possono contribuire abbastanza soldi (così come è strutturato il welfare attuale). E non parlo solo di pensioni ma ovviamente anche di spesa sanitaria.

È un problema enorme e voler far finta che non esista dismettendolo con un facile e unsourced ""eh ma tanto i ggiovani guadagneranno un sacco di soldi fra qualche anno"" è sintomo di estrema superficialità.

true,DFractalH,EURO,Großdeutschland,"&gt;The difference, and it's important, is that Bavarians and Prussians spoke the same language,

There are plenty of precedents were multiethnic states functioned over a long period of time without requiring one dominant *cultural* language. In fact, before the advent and at the beginning of the nation state, many of today's regions which are now subsumed within a nation state were far less homogeneous in their language. In fact, it usually went the way that a nation state was established and only then a common language or dialect was enforced, for example (the pinnacle of centralisation) France with the Parisian culture/dialect. Contemporary examples include India and China. I do not see why English cannot take the same role in Europe and why a homogeneous cultural language is required in the first place.

&gt;not to mention their common history in East Francia and later on in the Holy Roman Empire. 

How exactly would this have affected the identififation of the common people with nationalistic ideas when their usual frame of reference didn't exceed low double digits km? Such 'common heritage' might have been utilised to manufacture a national identity, but this is a - to say the least - conscious efforts on those creating the national identity. It is in fact the usual way of going about things, compare the utilisation of the manufactured 'Gaullic' heritage of France during the late 18th early 19th century. In our case, this artificiality is highlighted by the fact that plenty of states who were both under Francian and HRE rule are now parts of separate national states (e.g. northern Italy and the Netherlands).

In addition, again in the case of Europe, there is plenty of shared loss and history to be used to form some kind of identity. 

&gt;Same thing in the US where english was imposed and where the Amerindians kept being pushed west. 

English wasn't imposed at all. There never has been any official legislation and there is [none now](http://answers.usa.gov/system/templates/selfservice/USAGov/#!portal/1012/article/3206/Official-Language-of-the-US). English became the most commonly used language via a natural development, but only in the last century. German, for example, was in heavy use right up to the American entry into WWI.

&gt;And in the end, what lead Prussia and Bavaria to become one under the same flag or the different US states to do the same were not only the common cultural ties and agressive policies of the government but also, you guessed it, war. 

I agree that a common enemy, or let's say competitor, usually leads to a more unified approach to things. Let me just spell it out for you what this means in terms of the EU: **R u s s i a**.

&gt;However, if you think people with different languages, different customs, different philosophies, different interests etc. will all come under the same flag for a Federal Europe which, in the end, would only be giving more power to the current most powerful country in Europe (currently Germany but tomorrow it might be the UK or France for demographic reasons), you're dreaming.

You've got an interesting view on federal states. Do you see California or Texas dominating the US, seeing as they are the most powerful US states? Ontario or BC dominating Canada? Bavaria commanding all other 15 German states? A federal state can be one of the most beneficial power structures for local governments.

To see this, let's take a step back and think what a federal state means. It is nothing but a description of one part of the governmental - not the political! - structure of a state: territories with variable degrees of autonomy, local governments, and a central government with a variable degree of power. Nothing more, nothing less. 

So, no, I am not in fact dreaming if I think that such a structure can be used to govern Europe. I would even go so far and say that the EU already is a federal state with a, in some respects, very weak central government (the lines towards confederacy are fleeting).

A federation tells you nothing about the political system (compare the American vs. the Russian one), the way power is distributed (in particular state vs. central government) and a lot of other choices.

With respect to this, a federation might be the best choice of any government for a culturally heterogeneous crowd, simply because it allows for a very flexible power structure which can be adapted to ultimately respect the wishes of the local governments.

&gt;Also, I'm against this system because I find it totally undemocratic. 

Again you confuse two concepts. A federation has nothing at all to say about how power is *attained*, only how power is *distributed*. It can be a strongman, as in the case of Putin. Or it can be a reasonably well functioning democracy, as in the case of Germany. 

&gt;All nations have a veto which is rubbish. 

Where exactly in the EU does this happen? AFAIK it's not the case with Lisbon that any single nation can veto anything it wants.

&gt;Small nations are over represented in a parliament which has no power anyway 

Which is a symptom of the particular way power is attained in the EU's current form. That parliament has no power is simply false: it can essentially veto any new EU commission and any legislation presented to it. What the EU parliament lacks is the right to initiate legislation. However, parliament steadly grew in power, the latest being the fight to elect the Commission president (which it won).

&gt;and France and Germany have one member each at the Commission which is as much as small countries with 5 times less in terms of population. 

Wait, I thought federations were dominated by their strongest members? Cheap shots aside, this is simply how the EU has decided it wants to prevent strong countries from dominating the field. I won't argue for or against it, but I'll just say again that it is simply one way of doing things. We could as well do it differently, and the only thing preventing us is political will.

&gt;But then, this was made in order to be undemocratic with just some democratic paint on top.

That's just an ideological statement. Either back it up or I'll just assume you want it to be true.

&gt;Basically, not all nations are democratic, but all democracies function in a nation-state model. Take out this model, and you take away democracy. 

I don't see how this conclusion follows from anything you've written so far. To me this seems to be an entirely separate issue. Please elaborate on this.

also falls du es noch nicht getan hast: immatrikulationsamt andrufen und vielleicht sogar im sekretariat vom maschinenbau-institut und erstmal genau nachfragen was sache ist.

von bauingenieurwesen weiß ich, dass vorkurse zwar cool sind aber nicht todesnotwendig

aus eigener erfahrung weiß ich, studentenwohnheime sind immer schnell vollgebucht und haben ellenlange wartelisten und du wirst höchstwahrscheinlich keinen platz mehr bekommen, aber wohnheime sind auch total scheiße. wenn du dir ne wg suchst, wirst du einen riesigen stress haben, der sich aber auszahlen wird, weil wenn du ein zimmer gefunden hast lebst du um einiges besser. das soll heißen, dass wenn du in eine andere stadt gehen solltest/müsstest wo kein gemachtes wohnheimzimmer auf dich wartet, dann ist das nicht der weltuntergang (zumindest klingt das so , als wär das deine größte sorge). Tipp: 1-6 monate in ein möbeliertes zimmer gehen und von da aus ganz in ruhe suchen, bei mir haben aber oft 2wochen in einer jugendherberge auch gereicht um was zu finden, auch als 19-jähriger ersti.

&gt;Following the fatal [shooting of Michael Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Michael_Brown) on August 9, 2014, protests and [civil disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disorder) broke out the next day in the city of [Ferguson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson,_Missouri), in the [U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state) of [Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri), and the protests lasted for over 2 weeks. As the details of the original shooting event emerged from investigators, police established curfews and deployed riot squads to maintain order, while members of the Ferguson community demonstrated peacefully. Looting by a number of people caused violent unrest in the vicinity of the original shooting. Widespread media coverage examined the [post-9/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-9/11) trend of [Police militarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_militarization), especially when dealing with protests.

- et que dans le futur B, tu peux revenir dans le passé A et le modifier en passé / présent / futur B où les choses ne se déroulent pas de la même façon.

Du coup, tu vis dans l'univers A, personne n'est venu te tuer, tu as des enfants, l'un d'entre eux devient tempsonaute (ou que sais-je :p), remonte en 1990, te trucide avant que tu n'ais pu faire d'enfants et là ... le paradoxe, le gros bug mais en fait, si tu avais été tué(e) en 1990, tu n'aurais pas eu d'enfants, point.

&gt; bravura e brillantezza"" del canale

Condizione necessaria, ma non sufficiente

&gt; acquisto di pubblicità

Spesso c'è anche questo fattore

&gt; raccomandazione di qualche youtuber famoso

Certo, ma in generale c'è la promozione di canali (non nel senso di ""canale di youtube"") con molta visibilità: magari hanno attratto l'attenzione di grosse community online (es.: immagina quelli che finiscono in /r/all tramite /r/videos) oppure riviste online molto seguite. Sia questi canali, che venire citati da uno youtube famoso significa comunque ottenere molta visibilità. Non sempre avviene in modo spontaneo: Frank Matano inizialmente spammava di brutto su pagine di facebook e forum online.

Qualsiasi canale che abbia molta visibilità può lanciare di brutto in poco tempo qualsiasi cosa.

Spesso poi non fa successo il canale in sé, ma uno specifico video che fa il botto. Per Jackall: anni fa li aveva lanciati ""io sono molto leggenda"", poi c'è stato ""Lost in Google"" e infine ""Gay Ingenui"". Sono stati singoli successi che hanno fatto aumentare di colpo gli iscritti anche perché poi si finisce nella home page di Youtube e quindi quel successo viene amplificato. Se vedi molti canali famosi alcuni dei loro vecchi video sono ancora quelli che hanno ricevuto il maggior numero di visitatori. Quindi a volte sono stati aiutati da specifici video che hanno avuto molto successo in modo (più o meno) spontaneo... e siccome alla base c'era un canale interessante (non un singolo video ben fatto) hanno generato iscritti. 

In ogni modo: utenti come Frank Matano, Jackall o Guglielmo Scilla, ma anche byoblu non hanno fatto il botto sin da subito, ma sono cresciuti piano piano, sudandosi ogni iscritto. Facevano contenuti che piacevano alle persone, e vedendo una buona risposta degli utenti hanno continuato a farli con sistematicità, per anni, investendoci molto. 

Poi raggiunta una certa soglia, inizi ad essere rilanciato da canali molto forti (es.: il blog di Grillo per Byoblu e Mediaset per Frank Matano), ma comunque non avrebbe raggiunto quei canali senza una visibilità conquistata su youtube.",0,1409915628,null,0,false,0,ck9ss0m,t3_2fjeu6,t1_ck9ss0m,t3_2fjeu6,null,1427186224,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

true,aronsz,HUNG,Hungary,"1. Completely agree. I often get surprised by some random forum poster's beliefs on how this and that political system would work so well IRL... No. It's been tried. It failed. It failed bad. If you think communism would work like the propaganda says, take a look at the post-USSR states in Europe.

  We still couldn't manage to get ourselves back on our feet, and I'm worried that we won't make much progress in the next decades either. Making Hungary part of the ""Comecon""* single-handedly killed our agriculture (something Hungary had always been very proud of) by illogically distributing the industrial production over the Soviet states. Oh, we still got it pretty good, I mean, compared to ~~Beloru~~ Lukashenkia, or Ukraine, or Georgia, or the -istans we are still the rich and enlightened Western world...

  But no. Communism - as the westerner basement revolutionarys see it - is a utopia. It just doesn't work out that way. I know bringing up Orwell makes everything sound like a part of the circlejerk, but both Animal Farm and 1984 got a real good grasp of what it's like living under a regime like my parents and grandparents did. It's not a utopia. It's not even equality. Some people live in squalor, they starve, most are being intimidated and oppressed. A select few gets to enjoy the fruits of the regime. Just look at the shit Ceausescu pulled.

  There is no ""good communism"".

true,doctorheredoctor,BELG,Belgium,"Still it is a bit weird. 

In 1937 ~610534000 people were involved in the Sino-Japanese conflict.

By 1 September 1939 the total number of people involved in war was increased by ~114224000, a gain of only 18% - yet we consider this to be very significant.  Two days later when the Allies declared war I'm sure that number increased greatly (haven't checked the figure but I'll bet if you include the entire British empire it will be impressive).

There really was a lot going on right before the ""official"" start of the war.

The Spanish civil war had already begun in 1936, and the involvement of other European powers was obvious.  The Luftwaffe pilots bombing Poland in 1939 had Guernica fresh in their memory.  This could also be argued as being part of the central conflict despite Spain's later neutrality (but they did send volunteers to the eastfront!).  

In 1938 a European power (Russia) fought with Japanese forces on their borders and once again in 1939 until another interlude ended with the total rout of Japanese forces by battle-hardened Soviets in 1945.  Many more people died in a single one of these 'border skirmishes' than have so far perished in the Donbass war. 

In 1939 the Ukranians and Slovakians each had a war with Hungary. 
Also in 1939 Italy invaded and annexed Albania.

There are some who even argue that the entire interwar period ought to be considered a form of necessary armistice while the European powers reconsolidated.

Lo spacciatore ha tutto l'interesse nel proporti cose più redditizie e, difatti, è diventata pratica abbastanza comune tagliare la marijuana o l'hashish con l'eroina.

Nel momento in cui legalizzi, togli il punto di contatto tra la criminalità organizzata ed il potenziale acquirente.

&gt;###Green uniforms pass through Pazar
Followers of Islamic community in Serbia and the Party of Democratic Action in “March on Hadžet”. Organizers: It's just a performance, the young men are “flag-bearers”, and fezzes are a tradition

&gt;A FEW dozen young Bosniaks, dressed in green uniforms and wearing fezzes, appeared yesterday first on the central Novi Pazar square, and then in a procession of Bosniaks, lead by the heads of Islamic Community in Serbia (IzuS), Bosniak cultural community (BKZ) and Party of Democratic Action (SDA), which paid tribute in the Hadžet neighborhood to the Bosniaks executed there in 1945.

&gt;The news first appeared in the city that “mufti's army” has appeared; there were other information too, a lot of discomfort, and some concern among some Bosniaks and citizens of other nationalities – however, in Hadžet it was explained to journalists that it is not a formation, but rather young men, activists of Islamic community, who borrowed the uniforms just for today and for this occasion, that they're responsible for flag-bearing, and that it is a performance. Green color, as it was explained, symbolizes Islam, and fezzes are part of traditional Bosniak attire.

&gt;After the prayer, the gathered were addressed by the head mufti of IZ in Serbia dr Mevlud Dudić and mufti of Sandžak Muamer Zurkolić, who emphasized that in 1945. in Hadžet there was a genocide and that local authorities, without a court trial and proven guilt, quickly executed 2.000 Bosniaks. Dudić and Zukorlić called upon Bosniaks not to forget genocides such as Hadžet and Srebrenica, so they wouldn't experience simliar suffering again.

&gt;Such campaigns were previously organized by the supporters of mufti Muamer Zukorlić, but this time, along with mufti's supporters and associates, “on campaign” were also present the heads and activists of SDA. Many regard this event as the beginning of political convergence of Ugljanin and Zukorlić which have for decades been in a serious “political warfare”.

&gt;Official history claims that those executed on Hadžet were collaborators of the Nazi occupiers and criminals, headed by war mayor of Novi Pazar Aćif Hadžiahmetović, while on the other hand members of Islamic community and many Bosniak parties claim that – those murdered were innocent people who did nothing but defend Bosniaks from chetniks and others who endangered them.

&gt;##CONFLICT OVER AĆIF
The most controversial person resting in Hadžet is Aćif Hadžiahmetović, the recipient of Hitler's accolade. The official history claims that he committed many atrocities against Serbs and opposing Bosniaks, whom he wanted to Albanize. In BNV they emphasize that Aćif was a hero, that he defended Novi Pazar and Bosniaks from chetniks, and that he deserves that Bosniaks pay him due tribute. For that purpose, BNV has built a plaque in the New Pazar center in honor of Aćif-efendija, which lies today in the place where his house used to be, and in the local court the process of his rehabilitation has been started.

&gt;##INCIDENTS AND THE MAUSOLEUM
Few years ago in Hadžet there was almost a serious conflict between supporters of IZ in Serbia and the gendermerie. The conflict was avoided in the last moment. Back then, activists of IZ attempted to prevent the building of a kindergarten “on the sacred place” and hold a prayer, but the kindergarten was built nevertheless. Bosniak national council, headed by Esad Džudžo (he received an ID card on that name yesterday), plans to build a memorial center in Hadžet dedicated, it was announced, to all innocent Bosniak victims.

Who is Aćif Hadžiahmetović? Just like with any person in the Balkans, depends on whom you ask:

true,DreamingLight,null,null,"1. Il sub4sub è superato. A meno che non si iscrive uno youtuber grosso al tuo canale, non funziona più.
2. La maggior parte del pubblico è fatta da ragazzini. Questa cosa ve la dovete stampare nel cervello. Se si vuole diventare famosi bisogna proporre un prodotto che sia indirizzato a quella fascia d'età.
3. Qualità ripresa video e produzione video. Brutto da dire, ma difficilmente la gente ti caga se il tuo video è brutto da vedere. Qualche caso eccezionale c'è (es. Farenz aveva una qualità video oscena ma aveva dalla sua il fatto che ti spaccavi dalle risate).
4. Partecipa alle live. Cerca di infilarti in mezzo alle live, magari prima di gente con diecimila iscritti, per dire, poi a salire. Probabilmente saranno loro a farti entrare nelle live big una volta instaurata confidenza, che ti guadagni commentando spesso i loro video. Il commento che metti devi cercare di farlo diventare tra i più popolari, quindi via di battute che fanno ridere sul serio o critiche intelligenti. Scrivi in italiano.
5. Partecipa alle pagine Facebook degli altri youtuber. Cerca di essere tra i primi a postare commenti su Facebook, scrivendo qualcosa di intelligente. Ovviamente scrivi con l'account della tua pagina Facebook da personaggio pubblico, non l'account tuo personale. Devi likegrabbare con i commenti.
6. NON chiedere ""raga entrate nel mio canale? Vi rubo solo un minuto icsdi icsdi"": la gente ti ignorerà o insulterà.
7. Proponi il tuo video alle pagine Facebook che si occupano di Youtube contattandole in privato (es. L'occhio sul tubo). Queste pagine di solito servono proprio a questo. Se il video gli piace, lo pubblicheranno.
8. Impara a usare le statistiche di Youtube: vedi ad esempio l'età di chi ti guarda, il sesso, a che ora, con quale dispositivo, da dove arrivano le visite, ecc. Evita le annotazioni che sono fastidiose se puoi anche perché da mobile non si vedono ma se proprio devi metti il link anche in descrizione e fai sapere che ce l'hai messo.
9. Molti youtuber pagano Google per inserire la loro pubblicità su Youtube (che può apparire a inizio video o nel banner principale o da altre parti).
10. Usa titoli provocatori, magari anche falsi se puoi. Il tuo scopo è fare clickbait. Inserisci i nomi di altri youtuber famosi nel titolo *ogni tanto*, anche se ne parli poco e se non ne parli fai in modo di parlarne ogni tanto: trova una scusa ma non ti attirare haters. Va bene anche una battuta in mezzo al video, per dire.
11. Molti youtuber pagano quei siti che ti procurano iscritti e views. Io comunque non lo farei: è facile venire sgamati dalla community guardando le tue statistiche e se invece ti sgama Google inizia a salutare il canale.
12. Usa anteprime che attirano: il bel paio di tette o chiappe non muore mai quindi ogni tanto ficcaci di mezzo pure queste. Le anteprime devono essere fatte bene e possibilmente devono seguire uno stesso stile, cioè devi usare magari lo stesso posizionamento imagine-font, stesse dimensioni, magari anche colori. Devi avere delle guidelines. Non buttarci troppa roba.
13. Molti youtuber pagano pagine Facebook famose, anche estranee a Youtube, per far inserire il loro video nella pagina. 
14. I vlogger in ogni caso fanno poche visite, poi dipende dal tipo di vlogger ma se sei uno di quelli che sta fermo e parla allora difficilmente il tuo canale sarà popolare.
15. Se cresci un po', fai collaborazioni. Sempre iniziando con youtuber da qualche migliaio di iscritti.
16. Sii deciso, se segui questi consigli il tempo pagherà. Se decidi di fare una cosa, portala avanti bene anche se sei scoraggiato dal numero di iscritti.
17. Fatti un bell'avatar perché comparirà su ogni commento che lasci.
18. Non dico essere bello, ma non essere brutto. Bonus points se sei bello. Anzi se sei bello, io al posto tuo mi lascerei in contenuti alla willwoosh-de carli-ecc. Il successo è assicurato.

Il segreto principale per fare successo è solo uno:  
**Trattare argomenti che interessano al pubblico in modo interessante**  

FaviJ ha raggiunto un milione di iscritti in meno di 2 anni?  
Al 90% il motivo del suo successo è perchè tratta di videogiochi con un linguaggio e una comicità che colpisce la fascia più presente su Youtube: quella dei ragazzini dai 12-18 anni.  

Alla fine puoi farti raccomandare da PewDiePie, spendere centinaia di € in pubblicità e spammare dovunque ma se mancano i contenuti, o peggio ancora non riesci a proporli in un modo interessante, puoi stare sicuro che non farai più di tanto successo e che a lungo tempo difficilmente il tuo canale crescerà di iscritti e views.  

Personalmente ad un neo youtuber potrei consigliare:  

* Tratta un argomento di cui sei esperto e informati due volte prima di dare dubbie informazioni. Se possibile focalizzati su un'unica cosa.  

* Trova un modo interessante per esporre i tuoi argomenti. La gente non guarderà mai un video non montato in cui parli male, fai lunghe pause e non concludi i discorsi.  

* Se possibile scriviti giù un copione da seguire (magari per i vlog vale meno questo punto), questo ti permetterà di fare discorsi più complessi e di evitare di perderti in discorsi OT che fanno perdere tempo.  

* ~~strikethrough~~ prendi spunto dai canali Youtube inglesi e americani. L'80% dei canali italiani importanti non sono nient'altro che format stranieri già famosi all'estero portati in lingua italiana (potrei farti mooolti esempi).  
Personalmente i canali esteri sono una spanna sopra quelli italiani: molto più professionali, tecnicamente migliori e molto più interessanti.  

* Investi -&gt; Se registri i tuoi video controluce con un tostapane non aspettarti il botto di views. Ah non sottovalutare l'audio nei video, Yotobi lo apprezzo ma ogni volta che sento l'audio dei suoi video mi viene da spruzzare nel posteriore.  

* Usa i social per farti pubblicità ma non spammare come un ~~Daniele Andreani~~ demente.

Mica l'ONU è un'autorità che scavalca gli Stati nazionali!

Serve invece (o almeno dovrebbe) a garantire la pace, per come l'ho capita io.

Così come le risoluzioni ONU non sono mica decreti, mi immagino che ciò che produrrebbe questa eventuale istituzione plurireligiosa sarebbero solo pareri.

Non fate l'errore di proiettare la ""nostra"" situazione sulle altre realtà ""religiose"", perché solo raramente c'è un'autorità centrale strutturata e gerarchizzata come la Chiesa cattolica e quella ortodossa: non c'è nel Cristianesimo evangelico (esclusa la Chiesa anglicana), come non c'è nell'Islam, come non c'è nell'Ebraismo, come non c'è nel Buddhismo, solo per citare quelle geograficamente più vicine e che insieme già comprendono miliardi di persone.

Quindi non vedo affatto il pericolo del pensiero unico, anche perché le divisioni e le differenze ci saranno sempre, anche all'interno di una stessa tradizione religiosa.

Basti guardare, ad esempio, il prete che ha benedetto le fedi di due trans (articolo apparso su Repubblica), con buona pace di chi sostiene che le due comunità religiose e LGBT siano compatte e l'una contro l'altra armata.

Basti pensare inoltre alle numerosissime Chiese evangeliche ammerregane, le divisioni all'interno dell'Islam, le varie correnti dell'ebraismo, le diverse varietà del Buddhismo, l'infinità di Induismi, ecc.

Il downvote io non te l'ho dato: prenditela con gli altri.

&gt; Beh, il discorso è questo, c'è chi arriva ad un certo punto che vuole provare altro, vuoi perchè fa figo(adolescenti), vuoi perchè l'erba non da più le sensazioni di quando si inizia, così si cerca sempre quel qualcosa in più, e si finisce col pippare la pasta termica seccata e sbriciolata sul treno prima di andare a scuola(che poi, non chiedetemi che cazzo c'entra con la droga, qui parlo di ragazzini di 16/17 anni).

Tu dimentichi diverse cose però: la prima è che i minorenni si scassano già adesso di alcool, eppure è ancora legale. La seconda è che dire ""provano altro"" non è sufficiente: in questo modo demonizzi tutto ciò che è oltre erba/fumo. L'ecstasy, per esempio, è  una pasticca che *dovrebbe* essere composta da MDMA. Il motivo per cui non sempre lo è è proprio perché è illegale. La MDMA pura è una sostanza sicura: non uccide, non ti frigge il cervello. Di tutte le morti che vedi la maggior parte è perché c'era dell'altro dentro, una minima parte perché debole di cuore, si disidrata e balla tutta la notte, una minima parte perché si scassa con quantità di molto superiori alla norma (l'overdose è già difficile, l'overdose da morte ancora di più). Questo è per farti un esempio: quando si prova *altro* e si parla male di quell' *altro*, spesso lo si fa proprio per le conseguenze che derivano dall'illegalità della stessa e non dalla sostanza stessa (senza poi parlare della mancata educazione alla sostanza visto che di certo non ti insegnano come drogarti).
Gli eccessi poi, ci sono ovunque e valgono anche per il sedicenne che si sfonda di nutella e  muore per qualche cosa legata all'obesità qualche anno dopo.
E quindi, anche se si ""prova altro"", la scala è graduale e quelli che poi passano alle sostanze davvero pericolose sono una minoranza.

&gt; Sisi, questo sono d'accordo.
Però legalizzandola, lo stato cosa ti vende, quanto ci guadagna?
Vuoi che le case del tabacco non abbiano già pronti i loro prodotti da mettere su questo tipo di mercato?

It is disturbing because the movement these men are commemorating was organized by Aćif Hadžiahmetović, a notorious Nazi collaborator who was found guilty by a war crimes tribunal after the war of being responsible for the deaths of thousands of ethnic Serbs.

The tragico-comedic aspect of this is twofold. First, one of the main messages of the Mufti organizing this event is to call upon people to never forget Srebrenica. How a person can have so little introspection and basic decency as to think that the celebration of one war criminal is the best occasion to deny other war crimes is beyond me. 

What is by far more bizarre, however, is that most of the people taking part in the march are Bosniaks. Hadžiahmetović on the other hand was not only an ethnic Albanian, but his main goal was creating a greater Albania, which included as part of the program a policy of Albanizing the Bosniaks! The idea that some Bosniaks could seriously regard this person as a Bosniak hero is simply mind-blowing.

This does not mean however that they would support Belarusian involvement in the conflict in any shape or form. Lukashenka attacking Ukraine together with Russia would be a political suicide for him. I am not even sure that Belarusian army would obey orders to do that.

So that's the majority. It is more interesting among the elites. Lukashenka and his clique made a career and fortune by being a friend of Russia, even though him and Putin hate each other's guts. Starting from the Russian war with Georgia, and especially now, Lukashenka is also very scared: Putin has undermined the whole of the post-Soviet architecture of the region -- an existential threat for all the former SSRs. So the government in Belarus is actually taking covert measures to prevent the Ukrainian scenario in Belarus. It is rumored that ethnic Russians are being removed from various positions of power. More overtly, Lukashenko did things like banning the use of orange black ribbons during the Victory day celebraitons in Minsk, the coverage on Belarusian TV of events in Ukraine is pretty objective (which is so out of carachter for Belarusian TV, it's spooky), and he maintained close links with the new Ukrainian government from day 1. Just recently, Belarus has liberalised trade relations with Ukraine and concluded a big contract for supplying dieasel fuel to them. The fuel was suplied to ""help Ukraine with the harvest"", but it is the same staff Ukrainian tanks run on.

Belarusian opposition almost anonymously supports Ukraine, there is a good number of Belarusians fighting on Ukrainian side. ",0,1409920193,null,0,false,0,ck9twhe,t3_2firh4,t1_ck9twhe,t1_ck9smqm,null,1427185700,17,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,17

Point is, he had to get on to the metro, ride to wherever the fuck he needed to go to do paperwork, then head back to hospital and go get medical attention. Is a twisted ankle an emergency? You'll be the judge, but it is still a fucking shame, FUD or not.

It would be an anecdote if it wasn't for my other friend's account of CatSalut. She served as a medic for about two years after getting her MIR doing a full-time job while earning as if she worked part time.

E comunque non sarebbe un'istituzione religiosa in sé, e il paragone con l'ONU non regge.

Per come me la sto immaginando io da queste poche righe dell'ANSA, dovrebbe evitare le guerre diffondendo la conoscenza e favorendo un'interpretazione più soft dei testi sacri, tipo citando passi del Corano che condannano la violenza perpetuata dall'ISIS e isolando così i fondamentalisti delegittimandoli.

Ripeto, per come me la sto immaginando io, secondo me ci vuole una voce religiosa non fondamentalista che parli sia ai fedeli/credenti/religiosi/praticanti, mostrando vie al dialogo alternative allo scontro e favorendo la pace e il dialogo fra le diverse culture, pur mantenendo le identità, e sia ai non credenti, mostrando un altro lato delle religioni che è quello maggioritario e non violento.

A) I rapporti tra Snowden e la Russia iniziano ben prima del leak;

B) Snowden subisce un  repentino cambio di opinioni, non so' se siano stati cancellati i suoi post su Ars Technica ma si passa da un ""la sorveglianza è ok"" al ""Governo di merda ci spia"", più o meno attorno al periodo dei suoi viaggi in India e Svizzera (entrambi paesi dove i Russi sono molto attivi);

C) Non è prassi degli stati quella di ricevere apertamente spie straniere (per ovvi motivi, ad esempio Mitrokhin o Litvinenko non andavano in tv con Blair) a meno che non siano agenti di un certo livello (ossia risorse dotate di informazioni abbastanza rilevanti), nel caso di Snowden invece, il primo ha persino intervistato Putin (ma lol). Bisogna essere veramente ingenui (per non dire altro) per credere che l'autore del più grande leak della storia dell'intelligence (non solo Statunitense) sia cascato per caso, dopo anni di spionaggio, perchè ci vogliono anni per raccogliere  dati tanto sensibili, nelle mani dei servizi segreti di una potenza apertamente ostile ed attiva non solo in Siria ma di li' a poco in Europa (con tentativi di fratturare un'alleanza  attraverso i vari leaks). La dialettica dell'eroe è infantile;

D) La dinamica è perfettamente compatibile con gli interessi della Russia (introdurre frizioni tra Stati Uniti ed alleati NATO,  vedasi vicende legate alla Germania);

E) Ci sono tantissimi buchi nella storia di Snowden,   non solo questioni logistiche, o nelle storie dei  suoi handler (legati a Wikileaks e ad ambienti del Cremlino);

F) Le modalità di trasferimento sono tali che solo il supporto di un servizio d'intelligence avrebbe potuto permettere alla vicenda di svilluparsi con tanta rapidità, per intenderci, ci sono piccoli stati che non possono permettersi di fare quello che Greenwald e Snowden hanno fatto. L'ingerenza russa (viste le modalità del trasferimento) deve essere stata programmata prima e non dopo lo scoppio della vicenda;

G) Snowden dice che la sua decisione è stata la ratio estrema, eppure non c'è traccia di denunce o di appelli, persino al resto della  famiglia (quasi tutta proveniente da ambienti militari/governativi/servizio pubblico, il nonno credo fosse un ammiraglio), ha copiato migliaia di files consegnandoli al nemico, eppure non  ha potuto avere il tempo materiale di verificare il contenuto di  migliaia e migliaia di  documenti, Snowden non aveva  nemmeno idea della provenienza (se da operazioni di spionaggio illegali o lecite) delle informazioni in suo possesso, e non avendoli visionati nemmeno poteva essere a conoscenza della sensibilità dei dati (se quindi la loro diffusione avrebbe messo a rischio la sicurezza nazionale o di uomini dell'intelligence).

Si può non essere d'accordo e molti altri utenti hanno fatto osservazioni intelligenti per ribattere quello che ho detto ( per la cronaca, lo hanno fatto senza insultare).

No ma non dico di parlarne male. Non saprei come spiegarti.

Per quanto riguarda copiare un youtuber, nel modo di fare e parlare, penso che sia un po' conformista come atteggiamento, emulare sarebbe più adeguato! Io preferisco comunque restare me stesso, e esprimermi per come ci riesco, cercando ovviamente di migliorarmi, seguire modelli, o imitare canali tanto per avere successo non mi ispira!

Mettere foto false, o titoli falsi non lo condivido nemmeno io, caricare un po' il titolo però può essere a volte un metodo per attirare! =)

Again, it's unfortunate that this is the case, but such is politics everywhere in the world.

And yet they never used a nuke or placed another country in a situation where they had to use it. Because nuclear deterrence works, even on crazy totalitarian regimes.

&gt; C) Non ritengo Snowden una spia, già il fatto che tu lo ritenga tale influenza tutto il tuo pensiero.

E' un problema di termini. Facciamo che tu fossi un dipendente d'ambasciata  ed io un operatore dei servizi statunitensi. 

Io che ti recluto =  il termine corretto è case officer, divento il tuo handler

Tu = agente,   sei una mia risorsa, il tuo lavoro è in effetti quello della spia etimologicamente parlando (dal latino specere, guardare)

Snowden  ha fornito ad una potenza straniera informazioni coperte da segreto ed  idonee a ledere la sicurezza nazionale del proprio paese, come da definizione del reato di spionaggio. Questo è fuori discussione, sarebbe stato colpevole anche se non avesse mai parlato con un russo  prima del leak (non figura l'elemento soggettivo, la sua convinzione di operare per la ""libertà"", del resto non spetta a Snowden decidere cosa sia giusto o sbagliato).

&gt; D) Allora visto che è compatibile deve essere necessariamente così?

E' il mondo dell'intelligence, non  il tribunale di Forum. Se gli indizi puntano in quella direzione, ci sono  palesi buchi nella storia ed entra in gioco una potenza straniera, allora la partecipazione da parte di un attore straniero deve essere presa per certa al fine di apprestare rimedi. Il lavoro dell'intelligence è di essere  paranoici.

&gt; E) Anche qui, fonti che non siano ex-NSA o NSA?

Questo  derubrica a prescindere chiunque si occupi di intelligence in maniera professionale (renditi conto che è come il grillino che ripudia la spiegazione del medico in merito all'utilità dei vaccini, in quanto dottore e dunque schiavo delle multinazionali). Leggi i post,  se poi non ti convincono motiva il tuo dissenso.
Comunque:

http://theweek.com/article/index/245492/5-ways-nsa-leaker-edward-snowdens-story-isnt-holding-up

http://thedailybanter.com/2014/07/significant-holes-emerge-washington-posts-nsa-story-late/

&gt; F) Questa non l'ho proprio capita.

Dei civili non possono organizzare il trasferimento di una persona che in quel momento è ricercata dai principali servizi segreti del mondo, senza preavviso, senza fondi esterni e senza aiuti da parte degli stati di destinazione. E' un lavoro di intelligence.

&gt;G) Scusate NSA, lo sapete che state spiando illegalmente il mondo? Scusate popolo americano, lo sapete che vi stanno spiando? Certamente, sono domande che uno fa e resta in quel Paese, chissà che cosa mai potrà accadere di male... Il fatto che tu consideri Snowden ""una spia"" e la Russia ""il nemico"" la dice lunga sulla parte che hai già deciso di sostenere ancora prima di intavolare un discorso.

Peccato che prima dei Russi esistano:
 i giornali nazionali, i giudici, il proprio rappresentante in congresso, le associazioni a tutela dei diritti civili, i propri superiori, la televisione, internet, i politici dell'opposizione.

Snowden non ha percorso nessuna di queste strade, invece ha copiato Gigabyte di dati e li ha portati a spasso per il globo finchè non ha deciso di consegnarli al  nemico (non mio, della potenza per la quale lavorava, un minimo di 'intelligenza quando posti per cortesia) che incidentalmente a seguito del leak ha dato una brusca accelerata alle proprie operazioni  di SIGINT e HUMINT in Europa ed ha invaso di li' a poco un paese vicino nel mentre  giornali Tedeschi entravano in possesso di informazioni riservate circa le operazioni di spionaggio statunitense in Europa.

Es wird im Westen von der Ukraine gesprochen, als sei es ein Land mit einem homogenen Volkswillen, und als dieser wird der von der neuen Regierung geäußerte aufgefaßt. Es gibt dort aber offensichtlich - wie überall - unterschiedliche Gruppen mit unterschiedlichen Allianzen und Zielen. Die in den Westen wollten, waren hauptsächlich die jüngeren Leute aus der Westukraine. Den Willen der anderen Gruppen wollen viele im Westen ausblenden, weil er nicht so gut paßt.

in münchen hab ich auch mal in ner wg gewohnt, obwohl da die wohnungssituation noch beschissener war, aber da bin ich in die wohnung von nem freund von nem freund von nem freund... reingekommen.. in bremen bin ich erst in nen vormöbiliertes zimmer für 3 monate im letzten ghetto untergekommen und hab dann ganz in ruhe ne nette wg gesucht. hat eigentlich gut funktioniert. am semesteranfang muss man halt nehmen was man bekommt und diese wg-castings sind ein echter horror, kann man nicht anders sagen und man nimmt sowieso finden kann. tut jeder und hat eigentlich auch immer jeder getan, selbst vor 20 jahren als sowas ja noch ""viel einfacher war"". aber wenn man nichts kaputt macht und so dann kann man eigtl immer schnell umziehen. man ist ja selten an viel kram gebunden.

was ich in ner großen stadt immer empfehlen kann bei der wg suche (falls du irgendwelche tipps haben willst): auf jeden fall irgendwie da pennen (hostel, bekannte, entfernte gruselige verwandte, egal). wenn man als letzter bei nem casting ist und noch nen bier mittrinkt oder so isses immer besser als wenn man dankend absagt und man noch mitm auto in die heimat fahren muss. ausserdem kann man dann auch noch auf angebote reagieren die abends reinkommen. 

wichtig ist auch zu schauen, wo die locals ihre angebote hochladen (hier in hb ist es zum beispiel das schwarze brett auf der stadtseite und nicht sowas wie wg-gesucht.de, was quasi nur die ""auswertigen"" benutzen). 

und wenn du jetzt noch sehr jung bist, wovon ich einfach mal ausgehe, dann brauchst du gar nicht groß bei leuten vorsprechen die alle 25+ sind, weil die meistens nach gleichaltrigen suchen. wenn sie dich einladen ist gut und wenn du schon merkst es passt nicht dann stell denen einfach ein paar fragen, wo und wie du noch so suchen kannst. Das hat bei uns mal einer gemacht und der hat mich nachhaltig beeindruckt.

Nein, eine Frage des Völkerrechts. Und das hat Russland mit dem Einfall in die Ukraine eindeutig verletzt. Die vertraglich vereinbarte Anwesenheit russischen Truppen ändert daran nichts. 

&gt;Thirteen members of the United Nations Security Council voted in favor of a resolution declaring the referendum invalid, but Russia vetoed it and China abstained.

&gt;Niemand wurde von ihnen zum Wählen gezwungen oder davon abgehalten.

&gt;The official result from the Autonomous Republic of Crimea was a 96.77 percent vote for integration of the region into the Russian Federation with an 83.1 percent voter turnout. 

&gt;Polling by the Razumkov Centre in 2008 found that 63.8% of Crimeans (76% of Russians, 55% of Ukrainians, and 14% of Crimean Tatars, respectively) would like Crimea to secede from Ukraine and join Russia and 53.8% would like to preserve its current status, but with expanded powers and rights. Razumkov characterized Crimeans' views as confused, unsteady, and sometimes contradictory and therefore vulnerable to internal and external influences.

&gt;A poll by the International Republican Institute in May 2013 found that 67% wanted to remain in Ukraine and 23% wanted to join to Russia.[33] A poll conducted by the Crimean Institute of Political and Social Research on 8–10 March 2014 found that 77% of respondents planned to vote for ""reunification with Russia"", and 97% assessed the current situation in Ukraine as negative. 

&gt;A poll conducted by the GfK Group on 12–14 March 2014 with 600 respondents found that 70.6% of Crimeans intended to vote for joining Russia, 10.8% for restoring the 1992 constitution and 5.6% did not intend to take part in the referendum.

Our [Science Museum](http://www.museoscienza.org/english/) it's also a nice place to visit, but don't expect anything of the size of the London one, for example.

Back to art, [Pinacoteca di Brera](http://www.brera.beniculturali.it/HomePage) (no english version for this one) can give you a nice overview of Italian art from the XIII century onwards.

I second icemaze's advice about nightlife: don't stay in the Duomo area, take via Torino and head to Colonne di San Lorenzo, which is a lot livelier, and going past them you'll reach also the Navigli district.

Razumkov characterized Crimeans' views as confused, unsteady, and sometimes contradictory and therefore vulnerable to internal and external influences.

Unfortunately it's all too common. It's a very similar mentality to the ""little englander"" mentality among UK people who want to pull out of the EU because they think everything will be fine forever if we all just sit on our little island and dont interact with others.

&gt;And it always seems to come from the most pro-Europe people, and federalists.

Well, don't tar them all. I'm fiercely pro-EU and am an EU federalist, but I support the idea of a strong EU with a global presence and no aversion to interaction with countries outside our borders, not some petty self-serving isolationist state which placates any and all in order to avoid having to ever do anything.

&gt;Honestly, this shit is mindboggling to me.

It is painful, I agree. There are just far far too many Europeans who've grown up with the insane notion that war in Europe, at least Western Europe, is a thing of the past and is banished forever to the history book, and that America is evil and NATO is too.

All the necessary resources are being put to action and we'll do everything in our power to resolve this matter quickly.""

I really hope this doesn't grow and isn't a beginning to something bad.

**Edit 1**: Minister of Foreign Affairs called out the Russian ambassador in Estonia, they are also in contact with the foreign ministry of Russia.

Urmas Paet (our minister of foreign affairs): ""This is a disturbing case. We are expecting help and cooperation from Russia regarding this incident and returning the Estonian citizen back to Estonia.""

**Edit 2:** I will try to give live translation of the press conference by the Internal Security Service that starts in a few minutes. Time is local time (GMT +3).

**Edit 3:** **17:00 The press conference has started.**

**Edit 4:** First information given is what we know already: armed group of persons that crossed the border from Russia kidnapped a counterintelligence officer at 9:00am and took him over the border by force.

**Edit 5:** Not from press conference: our president tweeted (he freaking loves twitter): ""It is unacceptable that the persons who violated the border kidnap an Estonian citizen from Estonian soil. I expect a quick solution for this case and the return of the Estonian citizen.""

**Edit 6:** Apparently they have technical difficulties so they will continue when they fix that. Also since we don't have access to live feed, only what reporters write to the stream, the updates might have 5-10 minute holes between them. Stay tuned.

**Edit 7:** Director General of the Internal Security Service: ""First information tells us that this incident is not motivated politically.""

**Edit 8:** The kidnapped officer is a male, he's an employee with a lot of past work experience.

**Edit 9:** There was a meeting at 13:00 (that is 5 hours after the kidnapping) where the border guards of Estonia and Russia also participated. Russian border guards denied any knowledge about the incident and the kidnapping.

**Edit 10:** The kidnapped officer was gathering intelligence at the time of the incident. The actual content is not revealed due to security purposes but it had to do with cross-border corruption and border customs. 

**Edit 11:** Prime Minister of Estonia who is at NATO summit in Wales at this moment, said that he hasn't notified anyone there officially as it is a matter between Estonia and Russian Federation.

**Edit 12:** Because the press conference has ended there probably won't be any more new information for a while. I will update this post once additional information comes up.

**tl;dr (outdated, read below for new info): There isn't much information as of yet, ISS (Internal Security Service) held a 20 minute press conference. Kidnapped officer is male, still held inside Russia, has good work record and past experience. Russia is being Russia, ie denies any involvement. General Director of ISS said this likely isn't politically motivated.**

**Edit 13:** Russia's FSB just announced they have detained an Estonia's intelligence officer. They said he ""was armed"" and ""gathering intelligence"". I don't know if they meant he was spying on them. That would bring a political aspect into all of this (not that this is a surprise).

**Edit 14:** FSB said they caught him in Pskov oblast, which is Russian territory.

**Edit 15:** Ministers of Estonia will have a briefing tonight about the next steps as soon as the Prime Minister returns from the NATO summit.

**Edit 16:** [The most read news article on BBC right now.](http://i.imgur.com/VSZpUBV.png)

**Edit 17:** It's 10.30PM here and I doubt they'll add any additional significant news today. See you tomorrow!

Imagine a liberal democratic Russia with accountable government and transparent institutions -- it would be the envy of the world and highly sought-after as an ally by the EU and the US among others.

Mi spiego.
Il problema principale delle infezioni (TBC in questo caso) trasportate dagli immigrati non è banalmente quantitativo, ma qualitativo. La sorveglianza deve essere tenuta alta perché questi soggetti possono essere portatori di micobatteriosi atipiche (cioè delle varianti della classe mycobacterium, oltre al più comune tuberculosis, detto bacillo di koch), che possono presentare profili particolari di resistenza antibiotica, caratteristiche morfologiche alterate, presentazioni cliniche dei sintomi inusuali eccetera eccetera. Questo in soldoni significa che la diffusione di queste micobatteriosi TBC-like può creare una grande confusione da un punto di vista diagnostico e terapeutico, rappresentando quindi una minaccia per la salute pubblica.

Ho in definitiva molto apprezzato questo post perché smonta questo polverone che sa tanto di demagogico e poco di interesse nella pubblica sanità, ma invito comunque tutti a tener presente che ci sono degli aspetti critici infettivologici, legati all'immigrazione che vanno sempre tenuti in considerazione.

true,elrohir_ancalin,null,null,"When a country is a confederation or federal nation, like USA or Germany, it is somehow implied that states come together as separate political entities that agree to have a common government. Think of it like ""A constitution of Massachusets occurs prior to a constitution of the US"" (although I am not implying that his occurs before in ""real time"", it is more of a ""logical time""). It is also usually implied that there must exist legal mechanisms for leaving the federation, and that wherever there is no federal law states may regulate and tax as they please. However, these conditions are consequences, not a defining trait.

On the other hand, in the constitution of a centralized country like Spain there are no intermediaries: the people in all the territory of Spain come together, as individuals, to form the country. In addition, the constitution declares the country ""only and indivisible"", and even though it allows to ""lease government capabilities to local autonomous regions"", there is also a statement that ""the armed forces shall enforce the integrity of the nation"". So the main difference between autonomous regions compared to states is 

* 1) power comes to them delegated from ""upside"", not aggregated from their citizens,

* 2) The central government may unilateraly revoque the conceded autonomy

Now, in the context of this power-from-downside/power-from-upside difference, it usually occurs that some of the consequences also change: It is unconstitutional to try to leave the country, and power comes as a specific list of competences; whatever is not delegated explicitly remains to the central government.

However, it is perfectly possible, in paper at least, to write different constitutions that enable autonomous regions to leave the country or whatever. Virtually enabling the two types of states to work exactly the same.

So it is a matter of custom: federal states usually have a detachment-tolerant attitude, wheras central estates with autonomous regions usually have this ""you are free as long as you stay and don't piss me off"" Overly-Attached-Girlfriend attitude.

Needless to say, some Catalonians actually want to leave and many more what to *at least* have the ability to say what they think on the subject.

In the current constitution, however, you first need ALL SPAIN to agree on a constitutional change, just to make it legal for the Catalonians to take a Catalonia-only referendum. You must understand that in the central state the land of Catalonia belongs to a person from Madrid just as much as land of Madrid belong to a person from Catalonia. i.e. All Spaniards are legally seen as equal ""shareholders of Catalonia"", and the only vote that can allow catalonia independence is a favorable mayority in ALL OF SPAIN. 

This may sound ridiculous, but try to imagine a bank in Shanghai owning only a 10% on Microsoft trying to take over the entirety of MS Shanghai's plant, and all of a suden it becomes clear that with the current legal framework the Catalonians are asking something illegal. Still, I understand they have reasons for leaving and respect that. For me, It's just a matter of formality, if it was legally possible I would let them go happily and I intend to vote for that if questioned (I'm Galician and not indepentist, for the record).

true,Jaquestrap,UNSA,United States of America,"They would support countries because those countries are a part of NATO, and nobody is going to risk NATO falling apart. This has little to do with ""Europe"", this has almost everything to do with NATO obligations and relations. Poland is a very strong contributing nation to NATO, having contributed troops to every single NATO led operation since joining except the Libyan Civil War, and that was only because it was protesting the withdrawal of the Missile Shield from its territories (as it still viewed Russia as a threat at the time--and they were right). The UK and Western Europe would jump to the aid of Poland and the Baltic States should they be attacked because of firm and non-negotiable obligations of defense should a NATO ally be attacked. As the treaty stipulates and all members have signed and ratified, an attack on one NATO member is *treated equally as an attack on all*. If someone declares war and attacks Poland, they are instantaneously now at war with *every single NATO member*. And no nation in NATO is willing to let the alliance fall apart by shirking its obligations to help their ally, because then the entire alliance would fall apart, they would lose their own security (read: US military support) and the entire post-WWII/post-Soviet order would fall apart, drastically impacting international diplomacy, causing a multitude of conflicts, and devastating international trade, exchange, etc. If a nation shirked it's NATO obligations and refused to defend a NATO ally, it would instantaneously become an international pariah.

TL;DR This is a NATO oriented operation, not a EU oriented one. The UK would help if Poland or the Baltic States were attacked because it is firmly bound under no uncertain terms to do so, as would every single NATO ally including the US, France, Germany, Canada, Greece, Norway, Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Czech Republic, Turkey, etc. NATO is the one international organization that is quite firm and not open to any sort of interpretation about its obligations and what would happen if a NATO ally were attacked.

true,mad05963,UNSA,United States of America,"Actually it accomplishes a lot.  Here's the strategic situation: Any actual attack by Russia will first be countered by the national army of the invaded country.  At best, any Eastern European nation could only hold off an attack for several days if not less.   The only way to ensure total safety would be to treat the entire Russian border as a single front and deploy NATO troops throughout its length. This is logistically untenable and strategically unwise since any push by Russia could employ far greater resources that any one section of that NATO front could hold as NATO's resources would be too thin across the front.  The solution is a rapid reaction force that sits behind the arc of conflict at the ready to await the invasion.  Once conflict in joined by the local national army and the Russian invaders the rapid reaction force moves in to provide support.  This is a spearhead, already in full communication with NATO command and networked to coordinate incoming resources from NATO allies, that can add significant firepower to any particular/vital theater of the conflict.  Under NATO guidelines the local national army resources would be under the command of the NATO field Commander, turning the conflict immediately into a NATO affair and sidelining that country's national politics/factions.  The rapid reaction force also signals compliance by allied countries to the defensive utility of the NATO treaty and its immediate implementation, making each contributing nation unable to second guess actions and investing them into the conflict without debate or lollygagging about with their own internal politics.  The last thing you want is any country with the means to confront Russia to sit and debate the merits of confronting Russia.  NATO, as a mechanism of war, sends a strong message.  Consider also that the reality of the situation is made more complex by the weakness of the Baltic nations whose leaders may capitulate at the first sign of an invasion of their territory or that of their neighbors.  If Russia manages to coerce any of those nations into proclaiming their allegiance to Russia (so they are spared a military invasion), or cede territory to it, Russia can gain legitimate control of the territories it wants by sheer fear, a replay of the dynamics that played out in the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Therefore it is necessary to announce, mobilize and entrench NATO troops to assure those nations that they will be protected.  This will hardly cause fear for Russia, but it makes their intimidation of the Baltic nations more difficult.  To conclude, a rapid reaction force is the most effective strategy to confront Russian military aggression with the current state of Eastern Europe's border with Russia, that does not  dilute the power that NATO can wield as the conflict widens.

I don't think the US should somehow invade us, nor do I think it will or can. Technologically, it is far easier for Ukraine to build nukes than for Iran, for example. It's even feasible to do so in secret if some kind of a behind-the-scenes understanding with the US is reached.
