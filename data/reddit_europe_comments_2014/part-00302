Because, as I have already said:

1. They're not ""flat-out worse"". GDP growth is slightly better in the UK, inflation is probably better in the UK, unemployment it's debatable and poverty it's debatable. ""the UK is actually doing worse than Germany, at least in flat numbers"" is not a very defensible claim.

false,matude,ESTO,Estland,"&gt; There are a lot of reasons, but mostly because you're role models of economic development we want to achieve.

Honestly for me it's more due to the cultural reasons. A few facts before I make my point:

* We used to be part of both Denmark and Sweden (Swedish time is *even today*, [after 400 years, remembered as 'the good old times'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Estonia_(1561%E2%80%931721\)))  

* Sweden's 4th oldest university is located in Estonia (Gustav Adolf II set up multiple schools and re-organized the societal and administrational structures such that they left a big impact)  

* [Danes got their flag from here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Denmark), in 1219. All Nordic cross flags are derived from theirs. There are many Nordic cross flags used for county flags in Estonia, dating back to 13th century. 
 
* Tallinn probably got its name from *taani linn*, literally ""Danish city"".  

* Estonia's [Coat of Arms is derived from the Coat of Arms of Denmark, dating from 13th century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Estonia)  

* We're Finnic people (like Finns and Saami people, both considered Nordic)  

* 15% of our words are from Low-German (because [German was the language of the cultural and political elite since 12th century right up till 1919](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Germans)). This paradoxically gives us actually a  *larger* connection with the other [West Germanic language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germanic_languages) people [Scandinavian countries] than the Finnish have because we actually use many of the same words. Something rarely considered.)  

* [We're included in the Old Norse Icelandic Sagas as Víkingr frá Esthland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oeselians). We [fought along the side of Swedes against the Danes in the Battle of Bråvalla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oeselians) (cheers mates). Also, Saaremaa has the richest finds of Viking treasures after Gotland in Sweden. This strongly suggests that Estonia was an important transit country during the Viking era. However nowadays nobody knows there were any vikings from these areas at all.  

* [We had Swedish minorities living here peacefully in cooperation for 8 centuries (until WW2)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_Swedes), we offered them [cultural autonomy and self-governance](http://www.estonica.org/en/Cultural_autonomy_of_national_minorities_and_cultural_self-government_in_the_Republic_of_Estonia/) in 1925, something that was exceptional in Europe and earned a great deal of international acclaim, the local Swedes thanked and declined, showing they were okay with how things were. Afaik some islands *still* have dual language shop and street signs. Our main islands are still named Ösel and Dagö in Swedish).  

* We call ourselves *põhjamaalased* (""northern people"", another translation would be literally ""nordic people"" as *põhjala* is often translated as nordic), it's such [in many folk songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLD6rLNM_AE) that [are almost equal in importance to the national anthem.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%B5hjamaa)  

* [Know this Swedish red paint color?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falu_red) - common here too. Especially on the islands.  

* Estonians [are (were?) protestant lutherans](http://www.harwoodlevitt.com/wp-content/uploads//2013/06/Map-F.jpg). Now [Protestant Work Ethic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic) is an odd theory but I can't deny I've noticed similar sense of duty when doing wörk in the countries involved (in Estonia when one person passes by another who does manual work it's common to say ""*jõudu!*"" [Strength!], to wish the person good luck in his duties, and he/she will reply with ""tarvis!"" [needed!]). (Not sure how much this anecdotal evidence applies to the workers who have gone to Finland as cheap labour, I hear the Estonian builders have acted pretty awful there).

* [We used to use the Runic calendars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runic_calendar) (like everybody else in the Northern Europe btw). [Sirvikalender in Estonian](http://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirvikalender).

* Celebrating [Midsummer Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsummer)

* Eating [*vastlakukkel*/semla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semla)

* … crippling alcoholism? :D

Hell, if you read Hõbevalge by Lennart Meri he goes as far as suggesting the whole Norse mythology got its start from the Kaali meteorite falling in Saaremaa (Ösel). (Thor arriving on the chariot of fire, the sun setting in the east and disappearing for days, etc). Of course his 'proof' is dubious at best, but to say there are no cultural ties between the Nordic countries and Estland is almost laughably absurd (not saying this about your post specifically, but simply generally). The sea is often seen as a divider, but throughout the times it has been in fact a connector, culture thrived on coastal areas, sea trade routes have been the main way everything spreads.   

It feels almost an insult if the only reason we're not considered Nordic is because of economy and perhaps the less open society. Both something that could and will develop in time and should be an obvious difference considering we were occupied behind the iron curtain for 40+ years. It's as if here is your relative hoping for reassurance and help, but instead of warm welcome, the back is turned instead. There are many who consider Estonia to be the only Nordic country which was forced into the USSR and now that Estland is again independent the memory of the soviet times is so strongly rooted in the world's mind that even the thousand+ years of history that came *before* the USSR occupation is completely ignored/forgotten. We used to be Vikings, we used to be friends, we used to be not simply equal with the Finns but brothers (*vennasrahvad*) (so much so that regular people chose to volunteer to go fight in each-others wars for independence. Cultures so intervened that we ended up with the same tune for anthem by some funny twist of fate), we used to be so friendly with the Swedes there's an Estonian Swedish dialect (called Eastern now and lumped together with the Finnish. And… we burnt down your old capital Sigtuna, heh). But yea, now everybody just sees the soviet influence.

It's hard to say sometimes, you isolate yourself from people who think that way, and you end up in a friendly group of progressive, reasonable people. That's when you start thinking that Moldovians aren't that bad and people are getting smarter, only to get smacked in the face by reality when you actually read a survey. There are whole cities famous for their majority pro-Russian stance, notably the second biggest city in Moldova - Balti (ignoring the transnistrean Tiraspol, which is of the same size but lives in a different world), also known as the proudly self-proclaimed ""city of Russians"" / ""the Russian city"".

In May 2013, about 74% of Moldavians believed that Russia ""wants the better for us"", with only 11% believing the opposite. I do believe the percentage migh be somewhat lower now, but by how much?

Russians watch their Russian TV and spread out the misinformation to Moldavians who then teach their kids that Ukraine is ran by Nazis and Russia is the big good guy with better salaries than Moldova. And for a 20y old ""kid"" that never paid attention in school (Most Moldavians don't even pass the national exams at the end of high school, most of those who do pass get a a 5-6 out of 10 grade, which is the ridicoulous minimum) Russia becomes an expression of power and higher well-being. And they romanticize the idea of being part of it, the power and respect that putin has, ""people listen when Putin speaks"". For a small, useless, corupt country like ours, that is attractive. Putin is efficient, - if he wants something done, he gets it done. Our politicians talk and talk and talk and talk...

Western leaders are weak and soft, they do no have that sort of attraction. You will then of course hear about gay marriage and one of my university proffesors even told us (a 140 people class) that he once saw two dogs getting married in some Northern European country, which provoked (in him) some disgust and resentment towards the *very* free west, "" it's not all great out there"".

I'll see if I can find some real data.

But on the other side, our houses are much more solidly built and are way better insulated. Air condition isn't really needed in our houses, for example. This costs you less (energy also costs!), and is better for the environment.

German trains are ok, Swiss trains or Japanese trains are better. German trains are not really that timely. Compared to UK trains, however, the situation is better. But public transport isn't just long distance trains. It's also town-busses, tramways, short-distance trains (""S-Bahn""), things like that. In many places in the world you could not live without a car. In german towns, you could.

Cash transactions: if you stop using ""credit card"", but start using ""EC"" card, you can reduce your cash transaction quite considably. Not chaning to the local way of plastic money and then wondering that things don't work as expected is a bit ... weird. One should know that the german banking system is very different to the US. Since 60 years or so no one is getting the literal ""paychecks"" anymore. Every amount of money is transferred directly to the account. Transfers even to a different bank are usualy very cheap or cost-free. That made credit cards unneccessary. They also used to be quite expensive for the people asking for them (e.g. 15 years ago). And they are STILL expensive for the shops: the credit card company charges the shop a fee, I think it's a whopping 1.5% of the amount. EC transfers are however almost free for the shop. So, what kind of money transfer systems is the used by the people and the shops?

Finally, cash usage has it's positive sides.

BS Answer IMO..
&gt; According to John F. Kennedy's famous quote ""There is only one thing in the long run more expensive than education: no education"" the state of Germany supports their citizens in getting a first Bachelor's and Master's degree. It therefore funds universities, which than don't raise tuition fees. Programs which are designed to grant second degrees are not funded. The ""Master Online Photovoltaics"" warmly welcomes students to get their first Master degree, but it is designed to earn a second degree. Therefore the MO Photovoltaics needs to raise tuition fees similarly to anglo-american universities. Since previous knowledge gained through your past profession and/or education is credited, the overall cost for a particular student strongly varies and can be estimated to be about 200 Euro per credit point.

My brain was still working in English, and often I would only catch every third or fourth word in a sentence when someone spoke to me, so I would just have to guess what the full sentence was.  Once I became fluent, my family at home asked what it was like to transition to using a different language, all day every day.

This was the best way I could describe it: 1. Someone says something to me.  2. My brain hears what they say in German.  3. My brain attempts to translate what they just said to English so I can understand it.  4. My brain comprehends what they said and formulates a response.  5. My brain attempts to translate my response into German.  6. I say what I think is the correct response in German.

After I became fluent in German, the process drastically reduced:
1.  Someone says something to me in German.  2. My brain comprehends it (in German) and formulates a response (in German).  3. I respond in German.

When I wasn't fluent, people who often just have to stare at me for up to 30 secs while I figured out what they said and what I should say.

(Zero Hedge)

About Globalresearch.ca:

&gt; Chossudovsky is the son of a Russian Jewish émigré, the career United Nations diplomat and academic Evgeny Chossudovsky (1914–2006).

&gt; (...)

&gt; In 2001, Chossudovsky founded the Centre for Research on Globalisation (CRG), located in Montreal, Canada, becoming its editor and director. It describes itself as being ""committed to curbing the tide of globalisation and disarming the new world order"".[5] CRG maintains websites in several languages, including the English-language GlobalResearch.ca.

&gt; (...)

&gt; In a January 2012 article, he characterized the Free Syrian Army as ""a de facto paramilitary creation of NATO.""[6] Syrian president Bashar al-Assad e-mailed his father-in-law, Fawaz Akhras, to inquire how true Chossudovsky's claims were.[7] Chossudovsky also claimed that deaths of protesters in the Maidan Square in Kiev were ""triggered by Neo-Nazi elements""

&gt; (...)

&gt; He is a favoured commentator at Russia Today.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Chossudovsky

He has significant readership among the American pacifist anti-imperialist left, and his commentary just so happens to benefit the Kremlin greatly .... almost always.

And his father was a ""diplomat"", which reminds me of an ""FSO"" with the U.S. dpt. of State, which practically means ""spy"" anyways.

I'm Swiss, and oddly enough, many German Swiss find it really grating when (usually) Americans try to blend in and learn Swiss German.  It's a horrible enough dialect on its own merits, without someone butchering it.  There I can kind of understand someone not learning the language - it'd be kind like a French person moving to BFE Scotland and being asked to learn RP English while everyone around him is speaking either with a massively thick brogue or talks to him in French...

Thanks for the thought about people who're ""worn out"" - I've not experienced this with others in Germany, but it's interesting nonetheless.

&gt;Standard FTA/Investment treaty, though what makes it exceptional is the fact that it's between the two largest markets in the world, the EU and the US. Negotiations are still under way, so there is no way to know what is in it yet. But if it goes through, it's expected to raise the GDP of both the US and the EU by around 2%, will create a common standard of regulations in many areas (meaning that, by virtue of the size of the free trade area, other countries will have an incentive to adopt those regulations as well).

&gt;People are concerned about the secretive nature of the negotiations, however, ignoring that all FTA and Investment treaties are negotiated under such conditions, and also by the ISDS provisions. ISDS (Investor-State Dispute Settlement) is also a feature of most trade and investment treaties, and means that a country can be sued for imposing laws that unfairly target foreign investors. This does not mean that any law that's put in place that harms an investor is grounds for suing, rather the laws just have to be non-discriminatory, else the company would have grounds to sue. As an example, let's say the government passes a law that bans the use of a compound at over 50ppm (parts per million). A domestic company uses it at 40ppm, and a foreign one at 60ppm. The government can pass the law without fear of being sued provided that there's strong scientific evidence that 50ppm is where the danger level is at. Without that evidence, it would be unclear whether the government was imposing it at that level just to protect the domestic industry against the foreign competition (and hence would be discriminatory). I think those are the two main ones that people are worried about.

http://www.cibo360.it/cucina/mondo/rag%F9_bolognese.htm

I made two minor substitutions based on the quality of ingredients available.  Chuck top blade (flat iron/butler's) was substituted for la cartella (skirt).  It's identical in flavor, but probably a little less gelatinous because it has less connective tissue.  It looked a lot better than the skirt they had available, though.  I also used salt pork in place of the pancetta, it's basically cured pork belly without any other additional seasoning (or smoke).  The quality of pancetta I saw wasn't what I wanted to use.  Salt pork works well, but is... salty, so for that sub, no additional salt was needed in the recipe.

I think it came out well.  The texture was great, although I probably could have minced everything a bit finer.  I cut everything by hand, including the meat, because I didn't want too fine a grind.  The meat didn't dry out with 2 hours of simmering, so I think I picked the right cut to substitute.

After a 6-9 months and 600+ hours of German classes in the Volkshochschule of my town and my university, I was able to hold some basic conversations and everyday tasks but literally no one wanted to speak German with me, it's like everytime a german identify you as foreigner, they instantly switch to English just to make your life easier. (this applies for friends, people on the streets, girls in clubs, waiters, cashiers, etc.)

When I ended my Erasmus year in Germany and came back to my country, I presented the TestDAF, in which I got a B2 level, not enough to be accepted in a german university, thing that makes me really sad because I really wanted to go back and study another undergraduate, not only because the low cost of education but because of the QUALITY of it, specially for the field I wanted, Industrial design.

I'm talking from my perspective but I think that things would probably had been absolutely different if I had for example the level of immersion in the language with native speakers that I had in the US while learning English ( I don't want to offend Americans, I love you guys and had a great time in the US, but the average person there just don't learn a second language, which I guess facilitated this situation).

false,limespan,null,null,"I think you're making an excellent point, though I'm perhaps one of those your comment is directed at.

I first came to Germany for a semester and went back. I finished my Masters in Germany then did my PhD at a (very prestigious) university, all in English. And now I'm actually teaching in English. My main job involves research, but I do offer a course each semester, which is inevitably in English. Usually half my students are German and the other half are international students.

What have I done to learn German?
In the 7 years I have spent here, I took a 2 week intensive class in the first month I was here. That's it. I have a lot of German friends who all speak to me in English, my work is in English, in my field the publications are in English. So there is no *necessity* for me to learn the language, apart from the shame and moral pressure I myself feel for not having made the effort.

I do speak German, but my learning has always been in spurts of motivation followed by stagnation, so I'm not fluent. I took an exam that certified my ability at the B2 level one year back and then since then I've again not put in the necessary effort. But for the coming year I have resolved to clear the C2 (the highest level) exam.

Why I didn't put in enough efforts to learn German?
Motivation is not something that can be sustained for long, and if you haven't spent the first year solely learning the language, it becomes very difficult to restart. Plus there are always other priorities so that you only ever learn to the necessary level. I was doing a PhD and I suppose I could have squeezed in some German in there, but I never had it high enough on my priorities.

For those like me who have let it slide too long, I offer a Chinese saying:

""The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now"".

This thing with these girls and your comment is excellent example of failed multiculturalism and liberal naivete with rose tinted glasses, of which Angela Merkel has spoken. Those girls in fact were not Austrian.

Anyway as for the girls, well I am sure we all had our teenage rebellions, but this is just plain retarded. I wish they could come back, but I am afraid they will not be able to. 

Edit: Just want to explain myself a bit better, don't want to sound too chauvinistic. I just wanted to say that ""being Austrian"" entails more than mere citizenship, it entails some cultural norms, and I am sure that giving birth to babies so they can die for Allah is not ""being Austrian"".

To give you an example I live in California, and have three colleges in my local area; One is the local community college that can be used for the two first years of study. I don't know exactly how much it is but it is very cheap. Next we have a state school. In California we have two State University programs, The California State University system, and the University of California system. The California State University has an instate price of about 7,000 USD, but the price can dang near double with the cost of room and board, books fees and that sort. The schools also don't really have a strong reputation outside of the state or even really in the state due to the lower requirements. Finally we have the University of California that has a total price tag of 31,000 USD! Of cource this school is very prestigious both in and out of state but jeez luiz does it cost a pretty penny. Add 20,000 grand and that is what you would pay for out of state tuition for the same university. I hope this shows you what the average American has to deal with, and why private school is so much more popular here then in other countries.

I have known many other ex-pats in Germany who pretty much gave up trying to speak German because people in shops, bars, etc. and even their German friends would only want to practise their English all the time. 

You can say something in perfect German but with an accent, and people will switch to English automatically. Even if they think they are being ""helpful"" by speaking English, it can eventually come off as patronising or just plain selfish.

When I lived in the UK, we had many exchange students staying in our home and I always spoke to them in English to help them, even though I could have switched to their mother-tongue to make things easier on them.

To get to your original point about English speakers wanting to study in English at a German university: 

a) German is a relatively difficult language that is not widely spoken. Even as a linguist, I would have thought twice about doing a full degree in German when I was just a student.

b) Remember that many of these universities specifically offer and advertise courses in English. You can hardly get annoyed with people for wanting to take advantage of this offer. You can't act like they are demanding some kind of special treatment or assume that they don't want to learn German at all.

These courses aren't some kind of charity project for lazy foreigners. They are a great advertisement for Germany and German academia (which is great but still has a lot of room for improvement). Attracting so many young minds here from all over the world can only be good in the long run.

I wouldn't say they hated Germans, but they vowed never to buy anything from Germany, and my grandfather got very upset when his brother bought a Mecedes.

My dad was less anti-German, but didn't like them much.  Apparently German owners of a hotel in Utah told him there was no room there after he made a reservation months ago, and they were very rude to him.  This was in 1977.  He always warned me that if the world didn't keep an eye on Germany, they would cause another world war.

As for me, I think no people on Earth have ever taken responsibility like the German people.  I also studied in Europe, and met many nice German people.  I've met even more nice German people here in NYC.  I think you guys are very, very trustworthy and responsible.  

I just wish you guys trusted yourselves like many in the rest of the world do.  You guys smartly abhor nationalism, but you can trust yourselves to be an important actor in world affairs.  Even if you had a strong military, I do not believe you would act irresponsibly (like we do).  Germany is leaving a huge power vacuum in Europe, and I fear it will destabilize things.  It is unnatural for the country with the biggest population and economy on the continent to neuter itself for so long.

Anyway, this Jew trusts you guys, and hopes you become more involved in world affairs.

Also, please don't be so scared of inflation, Europe is on the verge of a deflationary crisis.  If this happens, racism and fascism will rise, and minorities will suffer.  That is the opposite of everything Germany wants.  Please remember that Germany itself became extremist after being economically punished.  Doing the same to countries today will result in extremism again.

I hope this isn't rude, I've had a few beers.

Germany will accept quantitative easing because of where in the cycle it's economy is now stalling. There are enough economists who will tell Germany inflation is not the problem.

But seriously regards the deflationary gap. I would have expected this sooner. Corporations are obtaining higher productivity from their workers, and therefore are reducing employment. Corporations are also making greater profits as a whole and this money is not going to national governments for infrastructure spending or other public programmes.

Governments all over Europe have redefined unemployment in unemployment statistics attempting to disguise the real unemployment and under-employment levels. Eventually the fall in gross incomes will lead to real declines in aggregate demand as the workforce becomes poorer. Certainly, this is fairly empirical. 

Corporations have the money and the people have a declining share. Export markets will not save large corporations. Europe as a developed world economy needs domestic [European] demand.

&gt;

&gt;The __Great Pacific garbage patch__, also described as the __Pacific trash vortex__, is a [gyre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyre) of [marine debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_debris) particles in the central [North Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pacific_Ocean) located roughly between [135°W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/135th_meridian_west) to [155°W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/155th_meridian_west) and [35°N](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35th_parallel_north) and [42°N](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42nd_parallel_north).  The patch extends over an indeterminate area, with estimates ranging very widely depending on the degree of plastic concentration used to define the affected area.

&gt;The patch is characterized by exceptionally high relative concentrations of [pelagic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagic) plastics, [chemical sludge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_sludge) and other [debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debris) that have been trapped by the currents of the [North Pacific Gyre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pacific_Gyre).  Despite its enormous size and density (4 particles per cubic meter), the patch is not visible from [satellite photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_photography), nor is it necessarily detectable to casual boaters or divers in the area, as it consists primarily of a small increase in suspended, often-microscopic particles in the upper [water column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_column).

Kepard: Very fast, best user interface but not that cheap,very  limited amount of countries to choose from. You can get free days by inviting people.   

Earthvpn: Cheapest one of them all, a TON of countries and IPs to choose from, the only negative is that the user interface isn't that nice, but it works good. Speed is good and has dedicated torrenting servers.  

PureVPN: Stay away from these guys. They offer a 30day money back guarantee but it is just bs. They stole me and this vpn never worked for me, worst experience with this1. Dont trust websites telling you that this is a ""top vpn"" , it isn't and they pay these websites for those reviews. This vpn is UTTER CRAP.  

expressvpn: Very expensive, awesome user interface, but not worth the money imo.  

Hidemyass: Its cheap, its fast , its works. The user interface is too big and comboluted for my taste and it uses too much resources to run. They have a free proxy service that you can use to access simple blocked youtube websites...    

privateinternetaccess:  I used this one and its very cheap, its fast and its simple. The only negative is that its based on the US,....so it isn't ""private"" at all...since they keep logs and well you knwo the nsa shit so if you are going to torrent I wouldnt use this1.   

Those are the ones that I have used, perhaps I missed a couple that are not worth mentioning, when I was living in germany I used to watch the NFL using kepard. I strongly recommend kepard and earthvpn over the rest, because of their speed and price. Most of them offer a 30-day money back guarantee so you can give them a try without any risk and choose the one you like the most. If you want a free vpn, which is shit dude, but if that is your thing, I would go for hotspotshield . However, if you want to watch netflix, nfl and etc american stuff I would use a paid one, because free ones are really slow and crash a lot. Kepard being my first choice but its a bit more expensive than earthvpn.

Clauses prevent S.Korea from lowering its level of openness
By Jung Eun-joo

&gt;*The provisions of the South Korea-European Union FTA (KOREU FTA) contain “poison pills” hidden in some clauses. One source of controversy is the presence of “ratchet” clauses. Although the government says this agreement includes none, the text contains phrases just like the ratchet clauses in that of the KORUS FTA (South Korea-U.S. FTA). A ratchet is a device that stops a cog wheel revolving in one direction from turning back the other way. In a fair trade agreement, a ratchet clause is one that stops one state from taking measures to lower its level of openness vis-a-vis the other state.*

&gt;*Regarding services and investment, Chapter 7 of the KOREU FTA states that all clauses of the agreement can be amended as long as they do not reduce the duties and agreements regarding market access, treatment of nationals and treatment of the most-favored nation. This phrase is exactly the same as that of the ratchet clause in Article 12 of the KORUS FTA.*

&gt;*However, Trade Minister and chief negotiator Kim Jong-hoon asserted on Oct. 22 at a parliamentary inspection of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MOFAT) that the former was a “standstill clause,” different to that of the ratchet clause in the KORUS FTA. A standstill is a principal of trade that prevents the adoption of extra protectionist measures. Lee Hae-yeong, professor of International Relations at Hanshin University, refuted this, saying, “A clause that prevents the adoption of new regulations and ensures that any amendments go only in the direction of further openness is one that prevents retrogression regardless of what it is called.” Lee went on to say, “It is clear that the inclusion of such a clause would place limitations on South Korea’s policy choices.”*

**URIEL FANELLI - LA TEORIA DELLA MONTAGNA DI MERDA**

Alcune persone godono nel particolare hobby di fare ""debunking"". 
Il debunking è l'abitudine di dimostrare, punto per punto, che le teorie cospirazioniste (UFO, HAARP, rettiliani, scie, 11Settembre &amp; co) siano false. 

Non ho voglia di spiegare che la cosa più difficile da dimostrare al mondo sono proprio le verità più semplici, direi quasi gli assiomi, se non fosse che non si dimostrano affatto: ci si limita a constatare che siano assiomi e siano necessari o presenti per chi si occupa di matematica inversa. 
Quanto più vicini siamo alle evidenze ed agli assiomi, quanto più complesso sarà dimostrare qualcosa nella media. I problemi sulle qualità di base dei numeri sono quelli che, come la congettura di Riemann, resistono di più all'assalto intellettuale dei dimostratori.
Allo stesso modo, dimostrare che nessuna industria farmaceutica ci stia irrorando gratis di anticoncezionali perchè agli azionisti piace venderli è di una complessita immensa; entrerebbero in gioco Peano e Pareto, e come scrive qualcuno, tutti mi darebbero immediatamente del fascista.

Il guaio è un altro: cento milioni di scimmie che battano tasti a casaccio su cento milioni di macchine da scrivere per cento milioni di anni probabilmente scriveranno l'opera magna della letteratura di ogni tempo e luogo.
Il problema è che produrranno anche una cataclismica, spaventosa, leviatanica, galattica MONTAGNA DI MERDA.

La proporzione tra le due cose, catastroficamente a favore della merda, è tale che normalmente si danno le macchine da scrivere in mano a persone delle quali si presume che scriveranno qualcosa di buono. Il motivo è molto semplice: se anche le nostre scimmie scrivessero l'opera magna di ogni tempo e di ogni luogo, il tempo necessario a scartare tutte le altre opere sarebbe infame.
Questo è alla base di quella che io chiamo ""la teoria della montagna di merda"". Essa dice, in sostanza, che un idiota può produrre più merda di quanta tu non possa spalarne. Prendiamo per esempio il famoso motore di Schietti.

Si tratta di una bufala catastrofica; è vero che i palloncini saliranno in alto, ma per gonfiarli in fondo al cilindro abbiamo usato più dell'energia che otterremo. Questa cosa è stata fatta presente a Schietti, dicendogli che un certo Boyle e un certo Mariotte hanno detto delle cose sensate qualche tempo fa. Il risultato è stato che lui se n'è uscito con un ulteriore delirio ""Schietti dimostra falsa la legge di Boyle-Mariotte"".
La cosiddetta dimostrazione consiste nell'introdurre ulteriore complessità: una macchina fatta di due componenti è difficile da falsificare, una macchina composta da stantuffi, leve, ingranaggi, miliardi di circuiti logici, eccetera è dialetticamente impossibile da debunkare completamente, perchè mancano le competenze.

Prendiamo per esempio il processore del vostro PC: si potrebbe dire che possa parlare con l'aldilà. Se siamo ciarlatani, intendo. A quel punto arriverebbe un tizio che lavora in Verilog o in VHDL e ci spiegherebbe che niente in un processore parla con l'aldilà. La risposta del cialtrone a quel punto sarà qualcosa di relativo alla fisica del silicio. Il guaio è che a quel punto l'esperto di Verilog esaurisce la sua competenza perchè la parte al silicio gli è nota solo in parte (quel tanto che serve a scrivere codice eseguibile dall'hardware nei tempi previsti), ma se andiamo allo stato dell'arte ci saranno esperti di fisica della materia che passano la vita sul silicio: chi ha visto la modellazione matematica di un singolo nucleo di idrogeno (un delirio di operatori hermitiani) sa bene che ""l'atomo di Silicio"" non è per nulla una cosa semplice. In pratica, se facciamo affermazioni riferite allo stato dell'arte ci vorrà un intero team di esperti per contraddirci, a patto di riferirci ad una complessità abbastanza grande di fenomeni fisici. Non esiste una sola persona in grado di discutere allo stato dell'arte di una CPU, ci vuole una squadra intera.

Il problema è che radunare la suddetta squadra ci costerà uno sforzo immenso rispetto a quello che costa al cialtrone affermare di pingare la madonna in persona attraverso la sua vpn. In pratica, economicamente parlando, vinceranno sempre i cialtroni perchè la competenza costa più dell'incompetenza. Ma c'è un motivo di tipo umano che mi impedisce di darmi a quest'attività. Il fatto, cioè, che queste persone siano arrabbiate.

Oh, non arrabbiate come mi arrabbio io con il cane se mi scava una pianta di susini per seppellirci il pane. Sono arrabbiate come stile di vita, nel senso adleriano del termine (Ok, ok. Ho conosciuto psicologi adleriani capaci di mettere a posto, in pochi mesi, anni di disastri di apprendisti stregoni. Siccome sono un tecnico, la prima cosa che ho fatto è stata di ficcare le mani nella scatola e ho letto un sacco di cose di Adler). La rabbia per loro è una condizione permanente, ontologica ed è un metodo di ricerca: la tal cosa è vera nella misura in cui pensarla sostiene la mia rabbia. Poichè molte delle verità che sono passate alla storia sono state inizialmente scomode (Nella maggior parte dei casi la verità è comodissima. Sono salito sulla metro stamattina pensando che mi avrebbe portato qui. Era vero. Sarebbe stato peggio se fosse stato falso e io sbagliando il senso di marcia mi fossi trovato a Cascina Gobba. In questo caso la verità sarebbe comoda mentre la falsità sarebbe un rompimento di coglioni), queste persone ritengono che ogni affermazione che suscita rabbia sia scomoda, ergo vera. 

Il problema è che esse non suscitano una vera e propria rabbia e non sono, nella media, nemmeno ""scomode"": si tratta quasi esclusivamente di affermazioni fastidiose. Fastidiose perchè il buon Schietti si ostina ad ammorbare i commenti dei blog di mezzo mondo con la sua parafilosofia. La strategia di queste persone è di ammorbare la vita alla gente con la propaganda delle loro idiozie. Poichè ad un certo punto ricevono una reazione di fastidio, deducono che la loro ""verità"" sia ""scomoda anziché capire che il problema, sta nella loro fastidiosa presenza e non nella loro scomoda verità. Lo scopo è quello di arrivare ad uno scontro, appunto, rabbioso. E questo è dovuto molto semplicemente al fatto che la rabbia è la loro condizione esistenziale: rabbia perchè si sentono impotenti di fronte a banche e multinazionali, rabbia perchè non riescono a realizzarsi, rabbia perchè si sentono maltrattati dalla società, eccetera.

La colpa di tutto questo, delle loro disgrazie ultime, sta proprio nelle leggende, nei mulini a vento che combattono e verso i quali rivolgono la loro rabbia. Ma il fatto che la rabbia sia la loro condizione ontologica, fa si che essa non sia l'effetto dei mulini a vento ma la causa. La loro condizione esistenziale è di essere arrabbiati, soprattutto, prima di ogni cosa ed a prescindere. Di fatto questi individui si sono aggirati per il mondo, digrignando bile e vomitando odio astioso, con una vocina dentro che chiedeva loro ""perchè tanto odio?"" 

Perchè tanta ingiustificata rabbia?

Improvvisamente arriva il ciarlatano e gli dice: ecco qui, puoi scegliere tra ""sono arrabbiato perchè mi nascondono la verità sull' 11 settembre"", ""sono arrabbiato perchè ci stanno uccidendo con le scie chimiche"", ""sono arrabbiato perchè la free energy viene nascosta al mondo"", e avanti di questo passo. In altre parole le teorie cospirazioniste sono solo un vestito, una copertura che serve a dare una motivazione apparente per una rabbia che altrimenti non si spiega; Blondet è arrabbiato perchè come giornalista è una sega fritta, perchè non ha credito in alcun ambiente giornalistico serio, denunciare il grande complotto degli ebrei gli serve perchè dire ""sono arrabbiato perchè la mia carriera di giornalista è una montagna di letame"" suona male, mentre ""sono arrabbiato perchè gli ebrei dominano il mondo e vogliono tagliare un pezzo di pisello a tutti"" suona meglio: non contiene un'ammissione di implicito fallimento esistenziale. Ora, qual'è la realizzazione massima della rabbia? Contrariamente a quanto si pensa, la massima realizzazione è la sua stessa diffusione; perchè ogni volta che l'arrabbiato vede che qualcuno si arrabbia con lui trae conferma del fatto che fa bene ad arrabbiarsi e quando qualcuno si arrabbia contro di lui, ha conferma del fatto che le sue teorie sono scomode (quando invece è la sua presenza ad essere fastidiosa).

Come scriveva Adler in Psicologia Individuale, ""il nevrotico troverà nella propria nevrosi le energie per sostenere la nevrosi stessa, per quante ne siano necessarie""(Adler contestava l'affermazione freudiana secondo la quale la rappresentazione della nevrosi di fronte all'analista fosse uno sfogo energetico, un calo libidico sufficiente a fermarla). O, tradotto in soldoni, essi produrranno sempre più rabbia di quanta ne possiate sopportare, più provocazioni di quanto possiate mantenere la calma, più fastidio di quanto possiate tollerare: l'energia libidica a loro disposizione, la grandezza della forza che li spinge in questo processo ha la cardinalità del continuo. C'è un solo modo di neutralizzare questa gente: stabilito che lo scopo principe di queste persone sia di perpetuare e di diffondere lo stato di rabbia ""a priori"" che produce il loro stato esistenziale, il solo modo di fermarli è di evitare i contatti con loro.

Essi sono profondamente malati di una malattia invisibile che si chiama rabbia. Lo scopo ultimo di questa malattia è il contagio e nient'altro che il contagio; non cambierebbe nulla nell'esistenza materiale di queste persone se si scoprisse che la CIA ha demolito le torri gemelle, nè se si scoprisse che gli USA vogliono sacrificare la quinta flotta alla guerra contro l'Iran, come dice Blondet, in entrambi i casi la nostra italianissima esistenza ne sarebbe inficiata assai poco, ne sarebbero inficiati poco i nostri successi ed insuccessi personali.

1. Du hast den falschen Bekanntenkreis.

Budget hilft. Und nicht über den Einnahmen leben.

Umzüge kann man selbst machen - wenn man weiß, daß man häufig umziehen muss, reduziert man eben seinen Kram so lange, bis er ins Auto passt, und holt sich günstige Möbel vor Ort. Wer jeden Monat umzieht, sollte sich über ""Pensionen"" Gedanken machen.

false,ecuaqueso,null,null,"&gt;American's simply don't study German in school.

I dunno about that, probably depends on your school district.  German was more popular than French at my high school, which offered German starting in the 7th grade (11-12 years old), all the way through AP German.  The district even paid for me to take further German &amp; Spanish classes at the local university once I'd completed the highest level offered by my high school.  This was public school, not private.  Spanish/German/French offered from 7th grade, 6 years of each available (with proficiency exams allowing one to skip a year as I did).

I'm not saying that many Americans become fluent in German, but at least in a lot of US public schools, German is still offered as one of the foreign language options.  Unlike in Europe, though, we don't switch languages when we cross a state border (as a lot of our states are bigger than European countries, going on a road trip across the US is kind of like doing the same in Europe, but you stay in one country), so most people don't get to practice the foreign language they learned in school unless that language was Spanish.

Anyway, the thought of going back to grad school in Germany for a different subject for free is an interesting idea, but at least in the sciences in the US it's not that difficult to get funding to study if you're any good.  If I were to try, one of the reasons would be to become fluent-ish in German.",0,1413097467,null,0,false,0,cl76d7l,t3_2ixz9u,t1_cl76d7l,t1_cl6xfk6,null,1426568702,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3

---

&gt;__Betteridge's law of headlines__ is an [adage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adage) that states: ""Any [headline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headline) which ends in a [question mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark) can be answered by the word *no*."" It is named after Ian Betteridge, a British technology journalist,  although the general concept is much older.  The observation has also been called ""__Davis' law__""   or just the ""__journalistic principle__"".  In the field of [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics), the concept, referring to the titles of research papers, has been referred to as __Hinchliffe's Rule__  since before 1988.

false,10ebbor10,null,null,"&gt;Nuclear waste container failure is a major issue right now, due to the failure of at least one of the very high tech containers inside of an underground storage facility (a salt cavern) here in the US, that was supposed to last for thousands of years.

It was to last for thousands of years, after it was sealed. You might build the strongest box you want, if you don't close it nothing it's not going to do much good.

&gt;It exploded and caused major contamination. I don't think they have figured out what caused it yet.

You mean, it exploded and the filtering system preventing any significant contamination outside the facility. Failure was correctly identified as having originated from the fact that the lab were the waste originated (after all, this storage installation was designed for medical and research waste)  had incorrectly prepared the barrels.

&gt;That incident should be seen as a reminder that there is a lot that we still don't know that we need to know about issues related to nuclear energy. Particularly storage of waste from nuclear fission.

Or you know, that you should fact check on Wikipedia before telling tales.

&gt; Solar Flare doomsday Scenario

1) Decentralized renewables will not aid in surviving a solar flare. After all, long range connections are essential to have a semblance of a functional grid with renewables, and it's those connections that will fail.

In addition, most renewables don't have cold start capability.

2) Failure of several transformators is unlikely to result in full grid failure. The grid won't work anymore, but parts of it can and will survive as islands, which will be sufficient enough 

3) Their solar event prognosis includes a failure of many basic supply chains, such as fuel and even food. Suffice to say, if that happens the US is pretty much done for.

4) The Chemical Industry needs electric power to cool and contain many of it's feedstock materials. In case of prolonged power failure, that will be what you want to worry about.

5) Their death toll estimation for the nuclear power failure (assuming IIRC, 50 spent fuel ignitions) was about 70 000 (eventual cancer deaths). ",0,1413102635,null,0,false,0,cl77dm6,t3_2ixrns,t1_cl77dm6,t1_cl6opm4,null,1426568160,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

The centralization plan had two main tactics.

The first one emerged during the 19th century. The general rule was: ""Convertiremos Madrid en un vergel, Bilbao en una gran fábrica y Barcelona en un immense solar"" (That is, we will make Madrid super splendorous, Bilbao in a big factory (it was the most industrialized zone in Spain in the 19th Century, along with Catalonia, specialized in metals), and Barcelona in a great 'sandlot' for the lack of a better word.

And the government prohibited the growth of Barcelona outside the city walls until 1860, when permission was given and [the famous Pla Cerdà was made.] (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/PlaCerda1859b.jpg/450px-PlaCerda1859b.jpg)

Barcelona grew immensely, like it had been so pressurized that it almost exploded.

The second part of the plan came during Franco's regime (1939-1975) after the Civil War. Basically it profited from the rural exodus and consisted to shift the internal immigration not only to Madrid and other big cities, but also specially to Barcelona. The plan succeeded and failed at the same time. On one hand, at achieved to dilute Catalan culture into Spain some decades and fall Barcelona and Catalonia with Andalusians and Extremadurians (is that the word?), as well as many other people from other parts from Spain. It failed in the sense that Barcelona grew such a lot more.

Barcelona was not as important as Madrid now, of course, but still, now it held firmly it's ground (we're talking about 1977, after Franco's death, during the transition). Now, in this year, the first great demonstration of democracy about Catalonia was held. Estimated were 1.200.000 participants. This caught Madrid off guard.

In the new Constitution, immense administrative power were given to the new regions, the Comunidades Autónomas (the autonomous communities). Consensus was that this was enough.

But let's go back for a bit:

Catalanism is, as a explained earlier, the product of the semi castillian colonization of Spain, strong enough to break the concept of the Aragonese nation, but not enough to arrive into Valencia 100%, and most importantly, Catalonia.

We have talked a lot about Aragon but not enough about Catalonia.
Has been Catalonia historically a *nation*?

This is a very debated topic, but one thing is clear, to say YES or to say NO is not possible.

The concept of Catalonia seems to have originated like in the XI century or so, after the concept of Hispanic March disappeared when the kingdom of Pamplona (later Navarra) emerged and the count of Aragon declared himself king. There were many other counties. Sobrarbe and Ribagorça, under the influence of Aragon, and 'the rest': Urgell (always big and snarky), Pallars, deep into the Pyrenees, Empuries (little but also reticent to authority), the Roselló, Capcir, and other two or three that now form the French Roussillon, and finally mainly Barcelona, which engulfed Cerdanya, Girona, Osona, Besalú, Berga, etc. All this region was commonly named Catalonia, and Barcelona was its *de facto* capital, never completely de iure. 
From the beginning of the union in 1162 of the Kingdom of Aragorn and the County of Barcelona (the rest of the counties were like semi vassal and semi independent), the holder of the Principality of Catalonia was called Count of Barcelona, fact which helps to reflect the abstention of this notion of Catalonia as an entity, much mess independent.

(Note: The De Facto vassalization of all this area to France finished when legendary Guifre 'the Hairy in 878 elected his son as successor and since then all the area wouldn't listen to the king of France.)

Catalan language, customs, traditions, etc. were being absorbed by the Castillian ones, as I said earlier, in Aragon (region) already before the dynastic union, and in Aragon (Crown) after it. The 19th century, specially after the 1st Republic (1868-1874), saw the movement of the ""Renaixença"", the Renaissance of Catalan as a language used publicly, and artistically. It began as a culture movement. The political movement was tiny and still had no objectives. Independence was absurd. It grew more political until the first Republic. Some extremists (for the era), already had proposed the ideal of independence, but it was widely ignored. 

It did happen, in the 2nd Republic, in 1934, the Catalan Republic was proclaimed by the president of the Generalitat. It was a personal more a personal move by him that an institutionalized act that the majority of the Catalans wanted. Those were such such turbulent times, the years before the republic, the system was mad. But in the Catalan case, the extremist section was already occupied by many anarchists and communists who didn't care much about Catalonian independence as much as the revolution of the proletariat.

In reality, what had happened was the catalans, mostly the elite, were absolutely fed up with Madrid and its centralized policy, which inhibited catalan culture for centuries and causes many many frictions with the superbig (at least compared to the rest of Spain) Catalan entrepreneur bourgeoisie.

Back to 1977. The new regional system comes with an obscure treaty. Jordi Pujol, nowadays in the epicenter of a super big scandal involving corruption, governed with his party, CiU (Convergencia u Unió) mainly moderate nationalists from Center, with many absolute majorities, uninterruptedly from 1980-2003. This treaty was done with Felipe Gonzalez, the PSOE socialist president who run Spain from 1982 to 1996 and consisted  essentially in: you leave alone the catalan bourgeoisie and I support you in Madrid always.

We mustn't forget 1992. The super boost to Barcelona the olympics gave can be still smelled in the city nowadays, in infrastructure, touristically, commercially, culturally, everything.
**Barcelona is now an entity as important as Madrid and Lisboa**, much more above than any other Spanish city. The three blocks I explained earlier continue today.

Not only that. Catalonia is super centralized. In the region over 7,5 million live, maybe 5 of them live within 30 Kms from 'the city'.
Barcelona has everything a big capital should need. A super big airport, port, logistics center, cultural influence, important banks and multinationals, a world-class touristic brand, and a big etc.
And the most important thing. A very big elite. Very big. Very cohesive. Very patriotic. Very rich. And very ancient. The Barcelona's 400 families nucleus and all the 'Alta Societat' around them exist since medieval times and in these last 40 years of democracy they have intertwined politics and economics, both for good and bad (corruption).

The economic, political, social force, influence of Barcelona, contained to this little territory of Catalonia, cannot now be contained easily.

This is why they have always wanted more and more power. In this last decade the movement of Catalonia as an ideal as grown exponentially. In 2006 the first bubble grew over the question of the Estatut, the magna carta which specifies which powers would the government give to Catalonia. It was approved in referendum, but the central government banned it. In 2010 a great debate arose over the question of the 'Pacte Fiscal'. Catalonia wanted the same treatment as the Basquenland and Navarra have nowadays, with special fueros derived from historical reasons, which consist essentially in the these regions manage their own taxes and the rest they give to Spain, not the other way around like the rest of the regions. A de facto (i like this expression a lot) nearly total independence from the central government. Again the government did not negotiate. 

From there the situation has escalated pretty quickly. 10-15 years ago, independentism was something widely known as something 'of the minority', a very vocal, mostly young and radical movement. Take 15% of the population wanted it.

Then in these last years, the second type of independentists has arrived: The masses.

Education propaganda, textbooks in schools (which I myself have experienced), semi control of some mass media, all of this, great process engineered by some few to one single objective: make the masses stop questioning 'why?', and begin questioning 'why not'?

[Typical specimens of brain eaten children.] (http://elmonomudo.com/wp-content/gallery/diada-2012-2/thumbs/thumbs_p1030759a-1600x1200-2.jpg)

The objective has been achieved, a feat of social engineering, sentiment manipulation, and loads of money. Specially relevant has been that simple argument, so easily eatable by the masses, of the ""Dret a Decidir"", the right to decide.

Of course, it is impossible to talk when people like in the photo of this. Because, dude, it all makes sense! Why would democracy not equal vote?

Utterly disregardable are the philosophic implications this statement provides, directly against the international jurisprudence since the Declaration of Universal Rights, the then so called rights of the rest of Spanish people, who basically do not want to see their country even more f***ed up, because, frankly, be the case of independence achieved in Catalonia, it's unquestionable that a massive capital outflow would succeed, along with the relocation of many companies to other parts of Spain, and basically the break-up and defenestration and throw away of Catalonia's economic system. And do not talk even about the ever-gagantic opposition of Madrid and basically the rest countries of Europe, USA, etc.

What did I say before that the time is up for Castille? So it is for Catalunya. This nationalistic sentiment is mainly based on sentimentalism and romanticism, it cannot pass a serious exam. The time for the forming of nations, at least in the western world, passed a century ago. It's too late. 

Catalonia has entered an impasse. It can bang itself against the wall or hit the reverse button.

One thing has become clear, at least for Madrid. The time for centralization is history, and continue with it will only engrave the situation. Catalonia's point has been clear, now negotiations, based in consensus, have to follow.

Catalan government issued a law regarding the voting the 9-November. The Spanish Constitutional Court has banned it. Radicals have the opinion to not to listen to the law. Moderates prefer not delegitimize the 'process' and try to make the law pass.

Catalan president Artur Mas has two options: He is the head of CiU. They were moderates before but have been pushed by the independentist wave, and many of their voters, instead of going to him, have channeled through more extremist parties, like ERC. He can be moderate again, at cost of being viewed as a traitor by many parts of society, or continue down the path of illegality, face unknown consequences by the central government, become a 'political corpse' most likely, and be succeeded as the head of the secessionist movement by another political figure, more extremist, like Oriol Junqueras, the president of ERC.

Spanish right wing president Mariano Rajoy has not good polls. In fact, he has lost half his voters over the course of 3 years. The two main points that maintained him as good decisions by his electorate are the abortion law, which has recently cancelled, going further down the polls, and the catalan question. He can choose to act firm as a rock and be seen then as a hero holder of Spanish unity and have more probabilities to win the elections Dec'15, or sit to negotiate, and expect to loose something to Catalonia, which would hurt him politically with the non-catalans even more.

This 15th Artur Mas's government will decide publicly if they abide to the decision of the Consitutional Jury. It's the bottle neck we all see coming from years, even decades. What will happen? It's exciting to wait.

Unlike Crimea the people in this region wanted to be part of Armenia before the Soviet Union broke up and Azerbaijan didn't controle it when it became indepenedent. The reason it's considered Azerbaijani territory is because the conflict is not resolved yet and Soviet borders became recognised by default.

And the problem with Crimea ^^^(a ^^territory ^^part ^^of ^^and ^^administered ^^by ^^Ukraine ^^for ^^more ^^than ^^20 ^^years) was that Russian forces forcefully pushed out the Ukrainian forces . But this wasn't the case in Nagorno Karabakh because for one it started when it was part of the Soviet Union and Armenia didn't have an army.

High German is fine, and appreciated.  Being Dutch, you probably speak it to at least some degree, and you ought to be totally fine speaking it.  We all grew up with Rudy Carrell... :D

We may obstinately speak Swiss German to actual Germans and Austrians - we're a bit weird that way, because growing up, we're taught that ""Hochdeutsch"" is proper, even though few of us speak it without a thick accent.  Plus we often have kind of a weird admiration/hate relationship with the Germans that's hard to explain.  Most Germans living in Switzerland quickly come to understand Swiss (and the ones who don't should), so while it seems kind of awkward to have one guy speaking Swiss German and the other guy speaking Hochdeutsch, it's generally considered a sign of good assimilation of a German immigrant if they can pull it off smoothly.

Regarding the lectures in Swiss German - that is really weird and a bit disturbing, actually.  I've _never_ heard of a higher academic environment using anything but Hochdeutsch in lectures, even when it's all or mostly Swiss people.  In smaller circles, such as study/discussion groups, sure, maybe.  I say this because I've lived abroad for most of the past 10 years, and I've noticed a seeming tendency for Switzerland to start looking inward increasingly during that time.

 2. Che c'entrano le bottiglie abbandonate? In molte parti di Roma esistono ordinanze (talora stagionali) che impediscono il consumo di alcolici e/o prodotti imbottigliati in determinati orari.

Sure we have that. I'm pretty sure this can be said for every language to some degree. Some examples off the top of my head: das/dass, Leiter (as in leader/director, as in ladder, as in conductor), die List/die Liste, etc. 

&gt; Not to mention pronunciations. English is not consistent.

Again, I'm pretty sure this can be said for every language. 

The way I see it, the problems you're going to have learning English, you'll also have learning any other language. 

But there are several grammatical concepts that just don't really exist in the the English language. Take the obvious example: articles. Der, die, das, der, dem, des. It's just damn near impossible to get all those consistently right as a non-native speaker. 


edit: just to be clear, this is, of course, my subjective view. I haven't done any research on this. Neither do I claim that English is in any way inferior to German. I love this language.

**Summary**

- Two of them actually, municipal and senate, I'll only talk about municipal elections, because this was only the first round of the senate ones.
- Currently, the *national* coalition consists of three parties, ANO, ČSSD and KDU-ČSL.


**The main parties sorted by national popularity**

- ANO is a few years old center-right party founded and lead by the second richest Czech, the billionare Andrej Babiš.
- ČSSD is a traditional left-wing party.
- KSČM is a communist party (yes, we have a communist party :/).
- TOP 09 is a few years old right-wing party, they position themselves as successors of ODS, as the ""main"" right-wing party.
- ODS is our oldest right-wing party, they used to be very popular, won several national elections.
- KDU-ČSL are christian democrats, a traditional party, they recently refreshed their leadership with younger people. They're strong on municipal level.
- Smaller parties: Greens, Libertarians, Pirates. (Not official names.)

**Results in Prague**

- Note that Prague is more right-wing than the average city / town.
- ANO won with 22%, TOP 09 20%, Greens+KDU-ČSL+??? 11%, ODS 11%, ČSSD 10%, KSČM 6%, Pirates 5.31%.

**Overall results**

- In summary, the three parties currently in the national government (ANO, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL) were relatively successful.
- I'm happy that Pirates got 4 representatives in Prague and they also *won* in the spa town Mariánské Lázně (13k population) with 21%, quite a surprise!
- Another good thing is that communists didn't do very well.
- In the second biggest city Brno, the recessist / hipster / whatever movement Žít Brno supported by the Pirates surprised with 12%. I think they're quite cool, have a look at their webpage: http://chcu.zitbrno.cz/.

That's like the equivalent of recommending Eminem, Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Fall Out Boy, Maroon 5, Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga, Flo Rida, Justin Timberlake to someone learning English... which is fine and all, but it's so typical and Top 40 music is easy to find with google.

Ammetto senza problemi che da *Senza contare che [...]* sono partito un po' per una tangente locale che riguarda problemi più fiorentini che altro. Vediamo comunque di chiarire, premetto però che non ho i mezzi per discutere della situazione di Roma in particolare.

1. In sé, è ovvio, mi sembra però un po' un atteggiamento cerchiobottista. *La movida* è una cosa meravigliosanei limiti e finché sono tutelati gli interessi e i bisogni della comunità. Ora, il punto è, chi è la comunità? Solo i residenti? I residenti e le attività diurne? Anche le attività notturne? La gente che è piazza la sera? Perché, ti posso assicurare, che non tutte le necessità di tutti sono tutelate o addirittura tutelabili (e.g. in centro in macchina dopo una certa ora non ci vai, ZTL, però non ci sono neanche bus dopo l'una di notte).

2. Qua si tratta più che altro di roba fiorentina, con parte della stampa [*cough* corriere fiorentino *cough*] che ha fatto della sua raison d'etre mettere in evidenza come il peggior problema di Firenze sia la gente in piazza dopo mezzanotte. Quasi al livello dei romeni di qualche anno fa che stupravano le italiche donne. Ora, puoi anche avere ragione, ma se la soluzione che proponi è *gne gne brutti e cattivi dovete starvene a casa*, la vede dura risolvere il problema. Ci sono rifiuti appoggiati per terra o su panchine/gradini? Fai passare la nettezza a ripulire e considera se non sia il caso di aumentare la presenza di bidoni.   C'è gente che piscia per strada? È un problema che va risolto, forse potrebbe aiutare la presenza di bagni pubblici, visto che non ne esiste alcuno e di demanda la soluzione del problema ai privati, finendo con una infrastruttura sottodimensionata rispetto al fabbisogno.

3. Proprio no. La città è dei cittadini. Che poi coincidano con quelli che pagano le tasse mi sta benissimo. Ma la città è di chi la vive e la abita.

&gt; Zuvor waren Biologen von einer Opferzahl ausgegangen, die im Bereich von Hunderten Millionen lag. ""Wir sind vollkommen überrascht von diesem Resultat"", sagte Peter Marra, einer der beteiligten Forscher, der ""New York Times"".

&gt; Außerdem befördern die Katzen jährlich mindestens 6,9 Milliarden, möglicherweise sogar bis zu 20,7 Milliarden Säugetiere ins Jenseits, darunter Maulwürfe, Karnickel, Ziesel und Grauhörnchen. Katzen töten, was sich bewegt und kleiner ist als sie, selbst vor Giftschlangen und Skorpionen schrecken sie nicht zurück.

&gt; Der Großteil der Wilderei geht auf das Konto von verwilderten Katzen, stellen die Forscher fest. Aber auch die Freigänger im Privatbesitz seien verantwortlich für ""eine substantielle Wildtier-Mortalität"", wie es in der Studie heißt. Die Forscher fordern deshalb einschneidende Maßnahmen, etwa Hausarrest für Katzen zur Brutzeit.

I'm curious about that, do you have some examples of this education text book manipulation. Since you experienced it yourself maybe you can even post some scan. Maybe I can take Ideas to rebuild Grand Moravia.

I'm also curious about the masses thing, since about 50% of the population in Catalonia is not of Catalan origin and a lot of those in the demonstrations were not educated in the democracy times. How did the elites manage to brain wash them when by the numbers of audience of media the Spanish media has as big a following as the Catalan one?

&gt; The time for the forming of nations, at least in the western world, passed a century ago. It's too late. 

You are aware right that a lot of the countries in the world are younger than 100 years? Even in Europe.

&gt;Catalan president Artur Mas has two options: He is the head of CiU. They were moderates before but have been pushed by the independentist wave, and many of their voters, instead of going to him, have channeled through more extremist parties, like ERC.

From the 'Pujol' part I had understood that CiU was the elites part of Catalonia, the same that you say control the independence movement. How it came to happen that 10 years ago they were regionalist and now they are for sovereignty, if they control the movement? I'd need more explanation.

&gt;He can be moderate again, at cost of being viewed as a traitor by many parts of society, or continue down the path of illegality, face unknown consequences by the central government, become a 'political corpse' most likely, and be succeeded as the head of the secessionist movement by another political figure, more extremist, like Oriol Junqueras, the president of ERC.

Well, if they are aiming for independence, it is assumed that there must be a point in which the legality of the self-determination right will take precedence over state laws. 

Is it possible that CiU was never really in control of the movement and they have just shifted they political space to keep with the majority of the voters and now have to continue to do so or fall into irrelevance? From looking at the demonstration reports it looked like he was being commanded to put the ballot boxes by a very wide spectrum of people.

How is that not saying that they are one and the same or dare I say equating them?

Secondly, I didn't call anybody a bigot but I do believe that it does constitute prejudice. In many cases opposition to free movement of labour is not based on the reality of the phenomenon, as reflected by serious academic studies, but on people's perceptions of it. Given that it has already led to a popular push to restrict EEA migrants claiming benefits (when they rarely claim them), it seems very, very divorced from reality.

false,StoneCall,SACH,Leipzig,"&gt; First of all, can anybody here tell me what's the deal with admission procedure for studienkollegs? Is there an entrance exam for them? How hard is it to join them?

Yes. Difficulty depends on the university and the general subject matter.

&gt; Also, I've read about the NC criteria for admissions to restricted courses. Now, I've been told that most computer science(Informatik) courses aren't subjected to restriction. I am not exactly sure of what that means. Do the universities take in anyone for these courses?

Everybody with Abitur or an equivalent EU secondary school diploma, yes. You still need to apply. However, some universities guarantee admission if you've passed the Studienkolleg that is responsible for the respective university.

&gt; So, here's my understanding of all this. First I apply to the university, which'll then tell me to join a studienkolleg first. So, I apply for a studienkolleg(which should be related the university?), which'll then tell me to take a test first. SO, I take the entrance exam. Enroll myself in a studienkolleg, and at the end of the course, I'll have to take the Feststellungsprüfung. After which I must apply again to the university. Is this correct, or did I misunderstand something here?

Pretty much, except you don't need to apply to the university and wait for their rejection before you apply to the Studienkolleg. Just apply for the Studienkolleg directly through the university.

* Someone walked into a bar in Amsterdam with a rifle, and started shooting. Two people got injured, one severely. A while after this incident the police may have found his car burned out in Amsterdam Zuidoost.

* There was a huge cancer-research. 130.000 people got packages at home with which they could provide ""samples"" to the research. The results are now in; 763 cases of colon cancer were discovered. In another 4000 people polyps were found wich may ignite colon-cancer.

* After a wild chase the police arrested a 22-year old Frenchman who ignored a police stop-sign in Belgium. There were speeds of upwards 200 km/h and the suspect attempted to drive other police vehicles of the road. The police found a sporting-bag full of weed in his car.

Because Felipe II in the Spanish golden Age, when Portugal was finally part of Spain again, had two revolts, one in Catalonia and another in Portugal. He choose Portugal live.

Portugal is not Castille, but Portugal is Spain. The Spanish, however, committed the same error as with Aragon: to make Castille=Spain, which is not true. Spain, the roman Hispania, is the entire peninsula, and the kings in the middle ages wanted to be known as 'the emperor of all spain'.

Oxford  ha un intake molto basso (più basso dei posti a disposizione) quindi è più facile entrare che a Cambridge;

Cambridge (sto pensando di  ritornare all'università facendo apply  come mature student, ma a matematica pura) è il top, l'accesso è più competitivo rispetto ad Oxford e credo per alcuni college occorra anche lo STEP.  Per l'undergrad, presentare  l'apply a Oxford esclude la possibilità di farla lo stesso anno a Cambridge (e viceversa);

Imperial è probabilmente la migliore dal punto di vista occupazionale per le discipline strettamente applicate ed è a Londra dove la vicinanza all'industria si fa sentire. Il problema è che mantenerti   costa un casino, non pensare ai costi della retta (perchè sarai sponsorizzato con un prestito) ma a quelli per condurre una vita dignitosa in una delle città più care al mondo;

Warwick: ottima per matematica, economia ed op research, molto competitiva nell'accesso;

UCL: ho un amico che fa il dottorato in  fisica (nanoscience), è buona, conosco anche un matematico di Birkbeck, ma comunque non siamo sullo stesso livello dell'Imperial;

St. Andrews, Bath e  Durham le conosco solo di reputazione, so che sono molto buone ma nient'altro (al limite posso chiedere a dei miei colleghi), per certo comunque hanno dei dipartimenti di CS e di matematica molto quotati;

Edinburgh costa meno delle alternative ed è una gran bella università, sono molto orientati all'ingegneria elettronica (soprattutto DSP, computer vision e machine learning),  per gli Europei (non inglesi) costa quasi meno del politecnico di Milano.

Il cap massimo per le rette per il prossimo anno credo  ammonti a 10k  pound annue,  nel caso di  cittadini UE iscritti alla laurea triennale (per la prima volta), i programmi dell'unione coprono le spese in anticipo, sarai poi chiamato a rimborsare il prestito al termine degli studi   contingentemente allo stipendio (credo il rimborso scatti con un contratto di lavoro &gt; 35k pound annui, ma dovrei verificare).


Considera anche Norvegia, Svezia,  Olanda, Belgio e Svizzera (grande upvote alla Svizzera).
Israele (Tel-Aviv, Technion) offre dei corsi di laurea in inglese, ma non sono informato, ma comunque è per me   che parlo la lingua già difficile 
andarci in viaggio, figuriamoci per uno ""straniero"".
Evita la Francia, dovresti provare l'ammissione ad una École  e c'è veramente da spaccarsi il culo (anche se non avresti poi alcun problema economico, se si passa la selezione ordinaria, durante il corso si è inquadrati come  dipendenti pubblici stipendiati, o almeno così funziona all'ENS e a X, che sono le uniche sulle quali mi sono informato. Bada bene che il Francese te lo insegneranno nei corsi preliminari).

Poi sempre provare negli Stati Uniti, una volta entrati in una delle università top 20, mantenersi non dovrebbe essere un problema con tutti i pacchetti di financial aid che ci sono.


Se il problema è di carattere economico allora  considera le seguenti scuole  che ospitano collegi e residenze universitarie e non sono malaccio per informatica, non è un elenco esaustivo: Pisa (se il problema è di carattere economico allora mettiti sotto e prova l'ammissione alla Normale o al Sant'Anna, sono molto toste),  Bologna (che  ha un collegio con borse che credo coprano le spese), Pavia (idem),  Padova (ma potrei sbagliarmi), Napoli (dovrebbero esserci due residenze universitarie), Torino (le fondazioni legate agli Agnelli e al San Paolo offrono qualcosa). Non conosco le altre, ho scartato  Milano e Roma  perchè le città sono veramente care.

Il mio campo è abbastanza diverso dall'informatica (studio Genetica), quindi non mi pronuncio sui punti di opportunità lavorative nello specifico. Se posso limitarmi a darti un parere, la realtà del regno unito è molto dinamica e i corsi universitari stessi ti indirizzano molto presto verso il lavoro, non sarebbe una brutta idea spostarsi subito secondo me. Ma sicuramente ci sarà qualcuno più esperto nel field che saprà consigliarti meglio.

3) Per la maggior parte delle Università del regno unito, la domanda si fa tramite il servizio UCAS, che è linkato in tutti i siti delle università. E' un percorso guidato easy peasy, con chiare indicazioni dei documenti che ti servono e altro materiale da allegare alla application. 

4) Per la University of Edinburgh (e credo anche per le altre) non ci sono test di ammissione (eccetto per Medicina). La selezione si basa sui tuoi voti del 5 anno e sul voto finale di maturità, oltre che a una lettera di raccomandazione da un tuo professore e un tuo personal statement. Per il College of Science and Engineering, il voto minimo richiesto per l'ammissione è 90/100. 

5) Ti consiglio di farti un giro sulle graduatorie delle università recentemente pubblicate, sia quelle del Times che altre. Nello UK Oxford e Cambridge sono le migliori, ma ci sono tante altre validissime alternative, specialmente nel campo informatico. 

6) Come qualcuno ha già detto, il costo della vita in generale nello UK è un po' più alto che in Italia. Tutto ovviamente dipende dallo stile di vita che hai (parlando di vitto, alloggio e attività ricreative ad esempio). Detto questo, la maggior parte degli studenti ''stranieri'' vive una vita tranquillissima e sostiene le spese. Alcuni lavorano part-time per i primi anni.

Those elections had as its main subject the independence matter, and the results were clearly in favour for the pro-independence parties. 

You talked about children brainwashed, and that really hurt me. If there are pro-independence parents who have kids, it is so normal that they raise them by the thoughts and valors they believe in. It is when the American child (or any other country) sings the anthem and he probably don't even know the minor thing about it. 

You talked about SO MANY THINGS, which have from little to none importance in the independence concern. You talked about Barcelona 1992, that was just out of context. we have got olympics in Barcelona instead of Madrid despite the uncountable attemps of the city to have them just for Barcelona's appeal. You talked about a ""super big airport"" which has less than 5 international destinations because they go all through Madrid. You talked about political and finantial corruption, while there is a new case of corruption in the rest of Spain in a monthly basis, splashing on PP, PSOE, banks, etc. In Catalonia there is one corrption scandal every half a year, or so (which is also quite lame). But this cases haven't really got much to do with the political parties other than the illegal finansation of CiU, which resulted with the impound of CiU's headquarters. Other than that, almost every corruption scandal has been family business or personal malversation. To end with this I would just like to point out that the central government sticks and hides behind the constitution, a piece of outdated laws which were set to vote only for those who are currently older than 57. The majority of the population is living ruled and conditioned by a bunch of rules they didn't even get to vote. It is known that if Constitution was changed they wouldn't recognise Catalonia's right to decide their future, but they aren't willing to change it anyways.

**Tl;dr** : Catalan independence movement has been always impulsed by the people, from scratch. There is not such thing as brainwash. Corruption scandals happen everywhere but it seems like only the few that happen in Catalonia are worth talking. Constitution is outdated, and no longer represents the people.

false,Aeduh,CATA,Catalonia,"&gt;I'm curious about that, do you have some examples of this education text book manipulation. Since you experienced it yourself maybe you can even post some scan. Maybe I can take Ideas to rebuild Grand Moravia.

It's mainly the history part. On one hand, specially in public schools, professors are completely one-sided. History is portrayed always as a succession of great affronts from 'Madrit' to Catalonia. Every time Spain is mentioned, it is called the 'Spanish state'. The Crown of Aragon is portrayed os the CatalanoAragonese Crown, which is historically repulsive. All kids are from little convinced that Catalalonia is the great, and then in secondary school also the influence of extremist student associations comes to place, and they infiltrate all public high schools and put posters everywhere.

&gt;I'm also curious about the masses thing, since about 50% of the population in Catalonia is not of Catalan origin and a lot of those in the demonstrations were not educated in the democracy times. How did the elites manage to brain wash them when by the numbers of audience of media the Spanish media has as big a following as the Catalan one?

Because Centralization from Madrid has been linked to ""Franco"", ""fascism"" etc. So all these Castillian speaking people are socialist and can't stand to hear the name of 'Franco', so this has facilitated things.
Also, the what was the very vocal independentist minority has always been also very extremist. Although now the movement is more ideologically diverse, still there are some people that 'shouted' all the time, making the impression that they were many more than in reality until it was true.

Also, being independentist is 'cool' now. If you are not, at least in the younger generation, you have to 'prove why you wouldn't be'. You have social pressure. I know some friends that posted photos of themselves with the 'estel.lada' flag, the independentist flag, and then say to me, really I don't give a shit about this, actually I'd prefer things to keep as they are now.

&gt;You are aware right that a lot of the countries in the world are younger than 100 years? Even in Europe.

Yes, but the level of infrastructure, social and economic relations, family relations, institutional, cultural, historical relations between Catalonia and the rest of Spain are so strong and tight that to cut off these would be like to cut off your own arm. Tecnically you can, but I don't recommend it.

&gt;They started this, but the spiral has gone out of hand. They wanted more negotiation power, but the wave is so big now and they have been pushed by extremists so much that between moderating the cause and loosing power and elections, and changing and try to lead the independentist cause they have chosen the second option.

&gt;Well, if they are aiming for independence, it is assumed that there must be a point in which the legality of the self-determination right will take precedence over state laws.

That's the argument of nationalists, and it can take to hours of discussion. Rivers of ink have been written about this topic.

&gt;Is it possible that CiU was never really in control of the movement and they have just shifted they political space to keep with the majority of the voters and now have to continue to do so or fall into irrelevance? From looking at the demonstration reports it looked like he was being commanded to put the ballot boxes by a very wide spectrum of people.

My language skill was not great but we spoke all in German (both her parents speak English pretty well) and they were very happy. Drank some whiskey with her dad.

2 days later I made a huge German Sunday breakfast for the two of us. About a million little foods on the table to choose from. One of the little containers was a box with the ring on it. In my mind it went better than reality as about 5 minutes into breakfast with me sweating about what is about to happen she tells me she is tired and is going back to bed. I pushed the table away from her, grabbed the ring, got on one knee, told her how much I was in love, and asked her to be my wife (in English).

false,_luca_,toscana,,"Io ho studiato informatica alla University of Edinburgh e ti rispondo in base alla mia esperienza:

&gt; 1) Una laurea nel regno unito, ai fini lavorativi e a parità di voti, è presa maggiormente in considerazione rispetto ad una conseguita in Italia?

Presa in considerazione da chi, datori di lavoro in Italia o all'estero? In ogni caso credo che cambi poco, soprattutto in informatica dove spesso e volentieri la laurea conta poco in confronto a quello che sai fare e a quanto sei sveglio. Poi vabbè, studiare a un'università più rinomata può essere un piccolo vantaggio, per esempio l'università di Edimburgo è abbastanza rinomata e molte ditte cercano gente proprio tramite l'università perché sanno di trovare persone valide.

&gt; 2) Secondo voi, è meglio fare la triennale in Italia e poi la specialistica all'estero oppure entrambe all'estero (o entrambe in Italia)?

Entrambe. La preparazione secondo me te la dà anche l'università italiana, ma fare l'uni all'estero è un'esperienza da fare e che ti darà molto. Per quanto mi riguarda mi sono trovato molto bene per il fatto che lo studio è meno nozionistico e più pratico di quanto penso sia in Italia. Però dall'altro lato sono più rigidi in UK, oltre agli esami hai spesso compitini o practicals da consegnare ogni settimana, ed i fuoricorso non esistono (è molto più simile al liceo che all'università italiana in questo senso).

Però a parte questo, l'università qui ti inserisce subito nel mondo del lavoro. Le vacanze estive sono lunghe (3-4 mesi) e già dai primi anni puoi trovare internships estive che pagano bene e ti permettono di fare esperienza e arricchire il CV. Come ho detto prima, l'università è in contatto con molte compagnie sia locali che internazionali (Google, Amazon, ecc.), quindi non avrai problemi a trovare lavoro fin da subito. Al di là delle internships, la maggior parte degli studenti trova un posto di lavoro fisso ben prima di laurearsi.

&gt; 3) Sapete l'iter da seguire per poter richiedere l'ammissione in una qualsiasi università del regno unito per un cittadino europeo?

Non è difficile, per la maggior parte delle università devi fare richiesta tramite l'UCAS. Ti costa sui £20 mi pare, devi submittere una serie di cose e fine, senza nessun test di ingresso nè niente, a meno che tu non voglia fare medicina. Quando ho fatto richiesta io, la deadline era a gennaio, a parte alcune università come Oxford e Cambridge che ce l'avevano a ottobre. Comunque sul sito delle varie uni trovi tutti i dettagli.

&gt; 4) E' difficile entrare in università come Warwick, St. Andrews o Univeristy of Edinburgh? Ci sono test di ammissione da superare?

Test di ingresso non ce ne sono, almeno nella maggior parte delle università. Semplicemente devi fare domanda e mandare una serie di cose. Non so se è cambiato il processo da quanto ho fatto domanda io, ma mi sa che ti servirà un professore che ti faccia da reference, e che tra le altre cose dia una stima del voto di maturità che probabilmente riceverai. Il voto di maturità è importante, ti servirà almeno 80-90 per le università più quotate, a me avevano chiesto almeno 90. Ovviamente poi ti servirà una certificazione per la conoscenza della lingua inglese, tipo il TOEFL.

&gt; 5) Quali sono le uni più consigliate tenendo conto del prestigio, del costo della vita, dei servizi offerti ect.. ?

Beh, le migliori sono ovviamente Oxford e Cambridge, ma penso che sia molto difficile entrare. La University of Edinburgh è molto buona, soprattutto per informatica, e soprattutto vedi il punto 6) per quanto riguarda i costi.

&gt; 6) Le spesi annuali che dovrei pagare se studiassi in un altro ateneo italiano che non sia quello della mia città sarebbero, più o meno, le stesse rispetto ad un ipotetico studio nel regno unito (vitto, alloggio, tasse, testi ect..)?

Le tasse in Inghilterra penso siano più alte, ma in Scozia l'università è gratuita (le tasse le paga la SAAS, se vai sul loro sito trovi tutti i dettagli). Quindi considerando questo probabilmente paghi meno qui che in Italia. Per quanto riguarda il resto, l'affitto a Edimburgo non è economicissimo, ma nemmeno terribile (penso si parli di circa £300 al mese). Per il resto la vita qui costa davvero pochissimo, se razioni un minimo i soldi vivi davvero con pochissimo. I testi universitari sono spesso consigliati, ma non obbligatori: soprattutto ai primi anni campi benissimo solo con gli appunti. Tra l'altro i libri spesso puoi prenderli in prestito dalla biblioteca senza bisogno di comprarli. Per quanto riguarda il lato economico studiare qui non è per niente un problema: anzi, come ho detto prima, probabilmente riesci a pagarti tranquillamente le spese con qualche lavoretto nel finesettimana o una internship estiva.",0,1413117411,null,0,false,0,cl79v7l,t3_2j0pw3,t1_cl79v7l,t3_2j0pw3,null,1426566998,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

The '92 Olympics were totally in context. If you are  not able to appreciate the importance this event took in Barcelona's history I don't know if you were able to comprehend the rest of things I said.
Were not to be because all the infrastructure, money, influence, tourism, brand name, and a long etc the games gave to Barcelona, the city wouldn't have been so important, less money would have come in, less culture would have generated in it, less social movements, less influence over the rest of Spain, less capability to have the social power to initiate a struggle of independence.

The airport of Barcelona is physically super big, one of the 50th biggest in the world when Barcelona is not by far in top 50 cities by population, specially after the construction of the T1 terminal. The reason behind Madrid taking all the transatlantic flights is mainly logistical, not some sort of petty revenge.

The corruption cases are as scandalous as here as in the rest of Spain.

false,SomebodyCool,null,insulti &amp; porchidii,"&gt; 1) Una laurea nel regno unito, ai fini lavorativi e a parità di voti, è presa maggiormente in considerazione rispetto ad una conseguita in Italia?

Nessuno ti assume perché ti sei laureato in un certo ateneo, punto. Al massimo venire da posti ultra-famosi può far dare una seconda occhiata al tuo curriculum sulla fiducia, ma se ti prendono o no dipende molto più da te e da quello che sai fare (e da come sai venderti).

&gt; 2) Secondo voi, è meglio fare la triennale in Italia e poi la specialistica all'estero oppure entrambe all'estero (o entrambe in Italia)?

Se la tua sola lingua è l'inglese, triennale in Italia e magistrale all'estero. Fare la triennale in UK è inutile rispetto a un buon corso di laurea italiano e ti costa *molto* di più, non solo di tasse universitarie ma anche di costo della vita. La magistrale in inglese la trovi anche in area germanica, dove ci sono programmi fantastici che costano molto meno che in UK.

La sola eccezione è se vuoi fare l'uni in Scozia, dove paghi molto poco, però con poche eccezioni (astrofisica a Edinburgo) non ne vale la pena.

&gt; 3) Sapete l'iter da seguire per poter richiedere l'ammisione in una qualsiasi università del regno unito per un cittadino europeo?

Lo stesso identico iter che per un cittadino britannico: UCAS, a meno che tu non voglia iscriverti a Oxbridge che come sempre deve essere speciale e ha una sua procedura.

&gt; 4) E' difficile entrare in università come Warwick, St. Andrews o Univeristy of Edinburgh? Ci sono test di ammissione da superare?

Le prime due sono considerate università d'elite in UK. Non ci sono test d'ingresso ma la normale procedura d'ammissione che valuta i tuoi voti italiani, la tua lettera di motivazione e le tue attività extracurriculuari (forse anche un essay, non ricordo). Secondo me se sei uno studente top della classe in Italia hai ottimissime chance, della mia classe di liceo uno fu ammesso a Cambridge e io a York e St. Andrews (poi non ci andai perché non vinsi le borse che mi sarebbero servite, ma cmq).

&gt; 5) Quali sono le uni più consigliate tenendo conto del prestigio, del costo della vita, dei servizi offerti ect.. ?

Secondo me le uniche due università dove ha senso fare la triennale sono Cambridge e Oxford, per via del sistema tutorale che non trovi da quasi nessun'altra parte al mondo (quasi, lo trovi nelle grande ecoles francesi, alla Normale in Italia, in alcuni 'collegi d'eccellenza' nati da poco in Italia e in non mi ricordo quale università olandese). Però costa, e se non puoi permettertelo con le tue finanze io ti sconsiglio di fare debiti per andarci.

&gt; 6) Le spesi annuali che dovrei pagare se studiassi in un altro ateneo italiano che non sia quello della mia città sarebbero, più o meno, le stesse rispetto ad un ipotetico studio nel regno unito (vitto, alloggio, tasse, testi ect..)?

Vitto e alloggio, a meno di non vivere in città italiane molto costose tipo in centro a milano, sono quasi sicuramente più costose in UK. Le tasse pure, a meno di non studiare in Scozia. I testi li compri su amazon o li scarichi (io li scaricherei, specie se fai informatica), il costo non cambia.",0,1413118197,null,0,false,0,cl7a1la,t3_2j0pw3,t1_cl7a1la,t3_2j0pw3,null,1426566913,4,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,4

At the same time, if you're using much less water and the pipes are therefore not always moving you get stagnant water, which needs to get flushed. Which is exactly what the water utilities are doing over here because German households are too bloody good at saving water.

Here in my city, water, household-scale, costs about a Euro per month plus 2.20 per cube metre. A more realistic price would be 5.50 per month base price plus 10 cents cube metre price.

&gt; Budget hilft. Und nicht über den Einnahmen leben. 

Ja. Budget is alles, wenn man kein Geld hat. Nicht über den Einnahmen leben ist ab dem Punkt unglaublich kompliziert wo die Fixkosten über den Einnahmen liegen. Dann muss man die Einnahmen erhöhen - das ist, wenn man Fixkosten von 450€ im Monat hat eher kompliziert, wenn man noch studiert nebenbei. Man benötigt eigentlich 2 Nebenjobs und wenn man einen Hiwi-Job an der Uni hat dann ist dort die bezahlte Stundenzahl selten idenitisch mit der geleisteten Arbeit. 

Fixkosten: Krankenkasse 150€+Miete 150€ (so billig zu wohnen ist schon Glück) + Essen 150€ (das ist schon wenig, Ja-Produkte.. etc.pp). Möglichst viel Selbst kochen, möglichst viel Gesund und ausgewogen. 

Wenn du gerade so 300€ in einem Job hast und du zeitlich nicht wirklich 2 Jobs machen kannst.. bzw. dir ein zweiter Job sagt, dass sie dich nicht haben wollen, weil du per Minijob-Regelegung über 450€ bist, weil sie dann Abgaben zahlen müssen - dann merkst du das nicht so einfach ist... Freelancen klappt manchmal - ist aber je nach Projekt und Auftrag auch Stressig und schlecht bezahlt. 

Die Freunde, die dir beim Umzug helfen - die will man mal sehen, Konzerte, was Kochen, mal Trinken gehen - Freunde auswärts besuchen (Trampen und Pennplätze, Couchsurfing hilft schon viel)... 

Kleidung, einmalige Ausgaben (Reparaturen, Computer, Notebook, Nachzahlungen... ) sind da nicht mit drinnen. Außerdem bewegst du dich in bestimmten sozialen Kreisen, wo man auch mal zu Mittag essen geht.. kann man skippen, aber das immer skippen ist halt auch Mist. 

Ich bin auch nie anders umgezogen, Möbel vom Sperrmüll + Aufarbeiten oder Familie... oder halt ein paar kleine Teile von Ikea. 

Wenn der erste Punkt nicht zutrifft: Einkommen &gt; Ausgaben und das Einkommen nicht signifikant über (bei mir so 500-600€) sind, dann kannst du nichts zurück legen. 

Dann bist du nähmlich in der blöden Armutsfalle - wo du durch Mahnungen, Dispo-Kredite und anderen Scheiß - den du erstmal vor dem Sparen loswerden willst (weil 12% Dispo-Gebühr bei 0.05% Leitzins sicher nicht dir hilft..) noch zusätzliche Ausgaben hast... 

Klar geht das, ich bin ja auch grad dabei... nur ohne Job der genug Geld bringt, ist das wirklich kompliziert.

I haven't seen as much talk about the secession of the Croatian regions, but within The Republika Srpska there's seems to be strong support for secession, and therefore there has been a lot of discussion about the region's ""independence"".

It's generally agreed that if the Serbian part of the country were to secede, it would quite likely become a region of the current Republic of Serbia. The issues with this possible development have been the number one reason for the negativity towards the secession within the federation, to my understanding. This would reinflame a lot of the issue that were on the table during the wars, which the Dayton Agreements, in part, more or less, silenced.

I've gathered, for instance, that some groups, I guess at least Bosniaks, feel that justice wouldn't be done if Serbia were to acquire the region. Before the war some of the regions within Republika Srpska were predominantly Bosnian, but this was changed during the war. 

Srebrenica, for instance, is within the current borders of Republika Srpska. It's there that the infamous [Srebrenica massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre) took place, later decided to be a genocide by the International Court of Justice. This is one of the worst examples from the wars, but it's relevant to bring up because were the region to secede, it'd mean, in some eyes, that the questionable actions taken during the war were successful and that they'd be rewarded on some level.

false,wub_wub,SERB,Serbia,"There is no real reason that makes sense. The most common reasoning from EU/US is that it would bring further instability to the region - which is true if nobody supports it. Bosniaks are against it because, *according to them*, the Serb side with it's mostly Serb population allegedly only exist because of the few alleged genocides.

And while it's true that demographics did indeed shift on all sides during the conflict, what currently exists as Serb entity was primarily inhabited by Serbs even before the war, and vice versa. The extent of the population movement is hard to pinpoint due to the fact that there was no official census conducted until 2013 - and the results are yet to be published. Here's the map from 1991 (you get roughly the same picture if you look at older maps too): http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/BiH_-_ES_N_1991_1.gif You can see the current entity borders here: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina%2C_administrative_divisions_-_en_%28entities%29_-_colored.svg


The dayton agreement sort of prevents an entity from organizing referendum and declaring independence and only allows for secession/division using legal framework.

As far as what the people there want, in Serb side around 90+% are in favor for the country to be split, and in Bosniak side around ~25% iirc - but don't quote me on those numbers as they vary from survey to survey and those are the last ones I read.

Just to be clear, I don't think that splitting the country is ideal solution - ideally it would be more unified without entities, but if that's not what the people want forcing them to live like that might backfire instead of improve over longer period of time.

**To sum it up**, there isn't really a good justification - it primarily boils down to ""because we don't want them to"", or some references to the past and the war which apparently to some means that any progress or change in the future is impossible.
____

I'm sure that a lot of people will disagree with me, and start going on about war, and how dayton agreement prevents the splitting of entities (even though it actually doesn't) etc, but apart from those arguments I'd appreciate if someone could give me a more reasonable explanation that makes sense seeing how this is 2014 and 1994, because I can't think of one.

I'm sorry if it came off like that. I meant that if you thought this whole debacle would end like this(As in, no more privatisation etc.) then that's a pretty naive stance to take.

&gt;You can't have ""De facto privatisation"", it's 100% owned by the state that is the definition of not privatised.

Right, I agree with you here. That *right now* at this moment, it is not acting similar to a private entity.

&gt;

&gt;The __Russell Group__ is an association of 24 British [public](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university) [research universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_university). It is headquartered in London and was established in 1994 to represent its members' interests, principally to [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Government) and [parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom); 19 smaller British research universities formed the [1994 Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Group) in response, which has since dissolved. In 2010, Russell Group members received approximately two-thirds of all university research grant and contract income in the United Kingdom. 

&gt;As of May 2004, Russell Group members awarded 56% of all doctorates awarded in the United Kingdom, and over 30% of all students studying in the United Kingdom from outside the EU.  In the 2001 national Research Assessment Exercise, 78% of the staff in Grade 5* departments and 57% of the staff in Grade 5 departments were located in Russell Group universities. 

&gt;The Russell Group is so named because the first informal meetings of the Group took place at the [Hotel Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Russell) in [Russell Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Square), London, generally shortly before meetings of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals (now [Universities UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universities_UK)) in nearby [Tavistock Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavistock_Square), close to the University of London buildings.

Non ci ho mai passato piú di qualche giorno, ma mi ha fatto una buona impressione.
 
Cosa _IMPORTANTISSIMA_ : il mercato immobiliare in Svezia é un casino! 
La ditta per cui andresti a lavorare ti fornisce un alloggio? Da quel che so a Stoccolma e Göteborg é praticamente impossibile trovare un affitto di prima mano.. Comprare dovrebbe essere piú semplice, ma ci vuole tempo...

&gt;Per me sarebbe una mossa di carriera, più che altro, ma con gli scandinavi ci ho avuto un po' tanto a che fare e professionalmente mi fanno paura: non li ho mai visti affrontare a muso duro un argomento, non li ho mai visti prendere in mano una cosa in modo pragmatico: o si lasciano annegare in continue devianze e tangenti che portano completamente ad altro, oppure l'approccio iniziale è completamente superficiale e quindi soggetto a continui fix di quanto fatto (tipiche le riunioni per decidere quando fare una riunione per prendere una decisione sul problema X).
Tu come la vedi?

Tutte cose che nel mio piccolo (sono un dottorando) vedo giornalmente. Purtroppo é veramente troppo spesso cosí. 

Un altra situazione al limite del ridicolo che si presenta continuamente é quando c'é un problema che potresti risolverti da solo in un paio d'ore, ma che non devi assolutamente fare tu perché non é tua competenza e il tuo tempo é troppo prezioso. Allora si passa per le persone competenti del caso e si aspetta una settimana invece...

Poi gli Svedesi vanno sempre interpretati... tipo non ti diranno mai ""no, quello che hai fatto non va bene"", ma ti diranno ""hai fatto un buon lavoro, ma perché invece non lo fai in quest'altro modo?"".

D'altro canto peró ci sono anche moltissimi lati positivi.

Stipendi decisamente all'altezza, una mentalitá tale che sia le imprese che lo stato investono tantissimo in ricerca. Una qualitá della vita che in Italia te la sogni.

A me per dire l'Italia manca moltissimo, ma ogni volta che torno dopo una settimana ne ho le palle piene e non vedo l'ore di tornarmene in Svezia.",0,1413120595,null,0,false,0,cl7an14,t3_2ixt5c,t1_cl7an14,t1_cl79y5t,null,1426566581,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

That is inaccurate ;-) It was the Crown of Aragon, as any Europa Universalis player knows. It is Aragon with Cataln culture and destined to rule Gonder (ethiopia).

&gt; All kids are from little convinced that Catalalonia is the great,

I think every kid growing up thinks that their nation (as they aspire to be) is great, or even that some dubious king was a hero. I don't think that's that special. I could imagine that children in Spain feel similar things since their National day (today) is connected with their Empire and colonialism.

&gt;extremist student associations comes to place, and they infiltrate all public high schools and put posters everywhere.

I'm afraid this is not really rare. Student association putting extremist posters against the capital and the empires is not that rare of a happening (although in post eastern bloc countries you see it much less, of course).

&gt;Yes, but the level of infrastructure, social and economic relations, family relations, institutional, cultural, historical relations between Catalonia and the rest of Spain are so strong and tight that to cut off these would be like to cut off your own arm. Tecnically you can, but I don't recommend it.

I don't imagine them to be much stronger than what Czech and Slovakia had, and the split has benefited both economies (specially the Slovak one, I'd dare say). Both still cooperate and there's a lot of people from one place working in another. Two states does not mean cutting of all ties, just power ties, at least if both states/peoples are grown up and civilized.

During the communist regime water was in state ownership and relatively cheap (0,8 CZK/M^3 at the end of 80's). Then the government transferred ownership of the water intrastructure to the cities and these sold it quickly to foreign multinationals (notably Veolia). Back then it was argued that the infrastructure needs a lot of investment and that any price increase would be allowed *only* due of to technological necessity. A lot of (unpunished) corruption was involved in these deals.

Two decades later: price of water grew up by ~100x (not a typo) while other commodities grew up say only 10x. Multinationals draw massive profits out of the country. Expensive maintenance of infrastructure was, however, left to the cities, multinationals were not interested in this part.

Nationalism runs in every human being blood, saying that every nationalism is bad is wrong. Nationalism is the fruit of the mistakes that every empire did back on the day, trying to convert someone into something that they are not; erasing the borders that once divided people that got nothing in common between them  (eg: USSR) , and creating new ones which separated an entire nation ( eg: Kurdistan).

&gt;Yet proposed U.S. legislation against the importation of textiles produced by child labor — to “protect” children from exploitation and promote their education — has had a devastating effect in Bangladesh, especially on the lives of those for whom it was designed to protect. I lived in Bangladesh in 1988 when raw jute was still the leading export. Children were begging in the streets, engaging in prostitution and other crimes, or doing hard labor. The rapid expansion of the garment industry created better paid, less arduous jobs for children. Though far from ideal, those jobs were vastly superior to what the children had previously. And they were far better than what the kids were forced to return to when, as a result of pressure from the United States, the children were fired by the garment industry. The one place that they did not end up was in school. Thanks to U.S. pressure, many children went back to prostitution and other dangerous behavior.

false,Chobeat,nostalgico,,"Internet è un pianeta da 3 miliardi di persone cresciuto senza una Costituzione. L’importanza assunta dai vari Facebook o Google e la necessità di continuare a garantire tutele e pari condizioni di accesso hanno però alimentato il dibattito sul bisogno di leggi specifiche. L’Italia presenta la sua proposta lunedì a una delegazione di 27 parlamentari europei: una Carta dei diritti frutto del lavoro della commissione presieduta da Stefano Rodotà. E la presidente della Camera Laura Boldrini dichiara «Ho istituito la commissione perché il Parlamento non può rimanere un osservatore esterno. Non possiamo lasciare il web in mano ai potenti, è uno strumento troppo importante. I cittadini hanno dei diritti che devono essere rispettati».
Composta da 14 punti
La carta, che nasce per fare da base a eventuali interventi legislativi e per essere portata sui tavoli di discussione internazionali, introduce il diritto fondamentale di accesso a Internet, ovvero quello di potersi connettere da qualsiasi zona del Paese o situazione economica e culturale di partenza. Composta da 14 punti, «si basa sui principi di eguaglianza, libertà e dignità che devono prevalere sulle logiche economiche», spiega Rodotà. Quando si parla di neutralità della Rete i paletti sono ben visibili: «È condizione necessaria perché possa mantenere la sua capacità di innovazione».
Diritto all’anonimato. E all’oblio
Non c’è spazio per la creazione di corsie più veloci (e più costose) per spingere i contenuti dei colossi. Sulla tutela dei dati personali e sulla profilazione delle identità a fini pubblicitari «ci vuole più trasparenza e garanzia di controllo dei propri dati». Introdotto il diritto di anonimato, in controtendenza con la volontà di Facebook di ricondurre i profili a identità riconoscibili. E quello all’oblio: si può ottenere la cancellazione delle informazioni non più rilevanti dagli indici dei motori di ricerca, come da sentenza europea, ma senza “limitare il diritto di informazione”.

In order for wages to rise as they did before the crash you need low unemployment. Because when unemployment is low and im not talking about unemployment rate which is a farce. 

Because lower unemployment gives people initiative to ask for higher wages because that means they can ask for pay raises and threaten to leave for other companies.


Also the main reason why wage growth is stagnant is because workers feel they have lower their wage expectations to remain employed. Lots of businesses are still struggling years after the crash and can not afford pay rises at this time.

That said, I don't know the extent of the protests... 2% of the population seems fairly large. 

Anyway, I think you don't really understand the situation there... people ALREADY pay for their water through taxes. Nobody is getting a free handout here, do travellers play a large role in this discussion? Perhaps someone in Ireland can fill me in.

Point is, the government simply wants to sell the rights to private water companies. The worry for the people isn't about not paying. It's that taxes won't go down and that water companies can charge whatever they want. 

I imagine a lot of Irish people will be looking to their neighbours in the UK where there are many private water companies and basing their opinion on that. 

That said, Ireland is interesting, it's a very boggy country and there are huge eerie alien spaceship-like water collection towers in towns across the country, that's how water is brought to many citizens so it's something that's in the spotlight for many and not part of the underground infrastructure as it is in many places. 

Remember what works in one country doesn't necessarily work in all. 

But if this goes ahead. Let's have a look years down the line and how water costs to the average citizen compares. It's an interesting discussion anyway, but I'll always believe a government should listen to its people.

but the authors of that one (not successive) study in their last paragraph say,

""the best data - the firm-level data is so far only available for four nations,""

when in 2008, I make it at least 13 nations used the euro, I think it's pretty reasonable to dismiss what Sadeh's saying as shit because it is not what he says it is.   

We have one study not successive, which only has firm-level data on four out of 13 nations.   That's not bringing anything down to anywhere.

I have figured it out.

&gt; What you say about nationalism is completely and utterly wrong. Nationalism in the modern sense is only a cultural construct that exists since two centuries ago and is bound to disappear again. 

Go tell a Scott they are English, go tell an American they are Brits, go tell youself, as a Spaniard, that you are Mexican. Nationalism has existed since ever. Maybe I should call it patriotism, actually, that was my bad. What I'm trying to say is that people are how they are for a reason. It is not arbitrary. As a Catalan I'm 100% proud of all the things my country has done, all the battles, the wars. I have heroes, just as lots of Brits would consider Churchill as a national heroe, for example. However, I give 0 shits about what Spain has done. Colonize and anihilate more people than the Nazis did during the holocaust in South America? I would be ashamed. The funny thing is that today is Spain's national day and you celebrate that, the fact that today more than 500 years ago, the majority of the population that were living there had their death sentences signed. You are making a huge mistake thinking that nationalisms or sentiments must adjust to the borders and jursidictial limitations we currently have. It is totally the other way around. The borders and the countries in the world must adjust their limits to the ones the people demand. 

&gt; Also, ""Every word you say, every sentence"" is an insult to my post, my intelligence and a complete act of demagogy, and I request you got that back off unless you write three posts at least as long as I have done, to at least demonstrate the thing ""Every word you say, every sentence"".

I don't know how can you take this as an insult. You are telling me to back off because my posts aren't as long as yours. Well, here you have: huwdgveoweybfenf8uhre0f8yb0r8efbher8hfv90wksmedwe    dwue9hfd98wehrfrewferfnerufnwunrefuwernfunwerfubewr8fy  9whjed9hweudnwunefuhwreufhweunfun bullshit bullshit bullshit bla bla bla. 

When saying ""Every word you say, every sentence"", I'm just showing my disagreement towards your ""completely scientific and empiric post with no sources"". If you are that arrogant and selfish to take it personal it is none of my business. Also, I can't find where the demagogy is in there, to be honest, but personally making a 3000 words long post to say the least from a ""neutral position"" which underestimates and undervalues the independentist movement and the Catalan people has more demagogy in it than whatever i have written that has bothered you so much.

false,TheMadFleming,FLAN,Flanders,"It wasn't only the Spanish, the Hollanders blocked the Schelde for centuries making Antwerp lose its importance. Antwerp used to be the largest Dutch-speaking city in the low countries by far with 100.000 inhabitants and the Duchy of Brabant was the most powerful province followed by the county Flanders, which used to be the most powerful but was weakened by the wars with France. 

Holland only had cities of 10.000-20.000 inhabitants. After Antwerp fell to the Spanish during the Dutch revolt only 45.000 inhabitants of the original 100.000 were left. This also happened with all the other cities in what is now Flanders. All those economic and religious refugees fled with their wealth to Holland making it the richest and most populous Dutch region.

While the Spanish were capturing Flemish and Brabantian cities Holland flooded the countryside behind us so the Spanish couldn't advance (they were mostly interested in taking one of the largest harbors of Europe, which was Antwerp). Years later Holland ""liberated"" or annexed Zeeuws-Vlaanderen and North-Brabant but gave them no power. Zeeuws-Vlaanderen was useful to maintain control over the Schelde.

I'm convinced Holland let a lot of these things happen on purpose to remove its biggest rivals, Flanders and Brabant and become the sole ruling power in the Netherlands to this day. Some of them even call the whole country Holland themselves and the Holland accent has been exported everywhere in the Netherlands in some form through media, a shame really.

Oh yeah and when we were beaten down and weak in 1815 they managed to get us back in the Netherlands where we probably would have stayed as another irrelevant bunch of provinces ready to be hollandified (no offence that accent is not my thing). 

But ironically Flanders owes it ""rebirth"" to the French-speaking elite who together with the catholics initiated the Belgian revolution. Even though I'm Flemish oriented I don't see the revolution as necessarily entirely a bad thing. Call it Flemish pride but a Fleming should never be ruled by an Ollander! The little backstabbers of the Dutch family! Hehe.

The most common reasoning from EU/US is that it would bring further instability to the region - which is true if nobody supports it. Bosniaks are against it because, according to them, the Serb side with it's mostly Serb population allegedly only exist because of the **few alleged genocides**.

What constitutes ""few"" in serbian language? What is acceptable amount of massacres for average serb to be considered non-issue? Or is it just Western conspiracy against glorious serbs?

I'm going to start slowly adding articles and reports of mass graves that are being uncovered. Stay tuned.

About 1,500 Muslims in the ethnically mixed municipality of Foca, some 40km southeast of Sarajevo, went missing at the start of Bosnia's 1992-1995 war in the first wave of ""ethnic cleansing"" by Serb forces, ex-Yugoslav army and paramilitaries.
About 600, including more than 300 inmates from the KP Dom detention camp in Foca, remain unaccounted for, according to figures from a Sarajevo institute investigating war crimes. Twenty-eight bodies were found in a mass grave nearby last week.l

Addendum to above from Serbian source - “The experts have, from the beginning of June until today, exhumed 89 whole and 644 incomplete bodies”, Muhamed Mustafić, the regional prosecutor, told AFP. The mass grave is located in the village of Kamenica, near Zvornik. This is a so-called secondary grave, in other words, it contains bodies previously buried and then exhumed from a different mass grave site, in a bid to cover up the crime.

“We have discovered women and children under 14 years of age among the victims”, Mustafić said. He added that a third of the site has not yet been explored and that the experts believe they will discover over 1 000 bodies.

false,MasterOfWhisperers,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Excuse me, but you did write a big long piece about the problems you see caused by immigration, from anywhere outside the UK. This was presented in a discussion about free movement of labour across the EU. Moreover you used arguments about immigration in general (many of which are applicable to non-EEA immigration) in a discussion about immigration from EEA countries. How is that not saying that they are one and the same or dare I say equating them?

The two types of immigration have things in common and have things which are differences. In the post that you responded to, I listed the complaints that applied to EEA immigration and didn't list the additional problems we have with non-EEA immigration. That's not equating the two. 

&gt; Secondly, I didn't call anybody a bigot but I do believe that it does constitute prejudice. In many cases opposition to free movement of labour is not based on the reality of the phenomenon, as reflected by serious academic studies, but on people's perceptions of it. Given that it has already led to a popular push to restrict EEA migrants claiming benefits (when they rarely claim them), it seems very, very divorced from reality.

Opposition to immigration can be caused by either bigotry or by very sensible and legitimate complaints. Given that more than 70% of the country wants to restrict immigration, and that I don't believe most of the country are informed mainly be prejudice, most opposition is coming from reasonable concerns. 

The push to restrict migrants claiming benefits when they've just got off the boat is a very reasonable one. It doesn't matter that fewer claim benefits: it's because most people feel that you or your family should have paid in before being able to claim from it. The restrictions suggested are the most basic: just requiring you've been here a matter of months first. Having said that, I do feel the issue is exaggerated but that's not because of popular prejudice. It's because David Cameron wants to pretend to the public he is doing something about European immigration and he's not allowed to do much else. 

As for your last position, I wasn't expecting to convince you - and I think the worst ""disaster"" is too strong - but I feel capable of convincing most people that free movement is far more negative than a points-based system.",0,1413127763,null,0,false,0,cl7cytb,t3_2ixp5q,t1_cl7cytb,t1_cl79d5o,null,1426565495,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

We had 1 thing that Aragon didn't we had a global Empire and we were a super power during centuries, it would be almost impossible for Spain to annex us, we won the battle of Aljubarrota because of our careful planning and English allies and for a matter of fact it would be a question of time until you saw an independent Portuguese Nation again.

When Filipe II had to deal with revolts he chose to let Portugal go because it would be impossible to deal with the Portuguese Nobility and a Portugal 100x times bigger than Catalonia(all Portuguese colonies), also the British had our back at that time.

The only way Portugal would be united today with Spain is if under a Portuguese King kinda the same that happened with the Union of England and Scotland under a Scotish King.

And yet you fail again, when you say sooner or later Portugal will be part of Spain, it's just absurd, it's absolutely impossible for that to happen in the next 100 years, some reasons:

* The trend is for Spain to split up, not the other way around.

* Portugal is a republic, Spain is a monarchy and Portugal would never change to a monarchy again and even more impossible is Portugal being ruled by a Spanish King without the use of force, so a Coup would happen in Spain which is very unlikable or a military invasion even more unlikable this days. 

* Even if a Union happened it would be doomed for failure Portuguese people have a really sense of nationalism that would be impossible this days to be destroyed by a central government we are talking about a culture and a language spread around the globe, also most population bellow the Equator line speaks Portuguese and have Portuguese Ancestry/Culture.

&gt;If you're going to argue, argue to the point.

I am not, the crimes that happened over 20 years ago were never the core of my comment - which you will see if you read it again and try to comprehend it.

No, I'm just saying that any sort of crime committed by any side no matter its size is irrelevant to the discussion.

&gt;I'm not proving your point

By looking back at the past and not providing any reasonable explanations about why the current bosniak population is against splitting, just like I said people will in my original comment (seriously, did you even read it?) you are. Read my last paragraph again.

Except that you are not arguing any of my points. List of recognized genocides is, last time I checked, 1 - but few (as in small number) additional ones are claimed - but have not been internationally accepted as such. Look up a list of genocides on wiki if you don't trust me.

Just as I said the Battle of Aljubarrota was won by careful planning and with the help of English Allies.

From the wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Aljubarrota 

""This marked the first use of English defensive tactics on the Iberian peninsula, reportedly without any casualties to the Portuguese.""

""English allies arrived on Easter of 1385, consisting of a company of about 100 English longbowmen, veterans from the Hundred Years' War, sent to honor the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 (presently the oldest active treaty in the world).""

""To calm the soldiers' nervousness and to improve his army's defensive position, general Nuno Álvares Pereira ordered the construction of a system of ditches, pitches and caltrops. This application of typical English tactical procedures had also been used by the Portuguese on the previous battle of Atoleiros and was especially effective against cavalry.""

So basically we had help from the English both tactically and with soldiers it was a big asset that Catalonia never really had through centuries.

It was both the Castillians being reckless and the Portuguese using the English Advanced Tactics from the 100 Years War plus some longbows and also very good planning from the Portuguese.

false,angry_spaniard,ESPR,Delenda est euro,"&gt; Why not expand the port to a international trading port and encourage some trade brokerages. 

I would say that the infrastructure of the port is very good and is working perfectly for all the international trade. A massive amount of containers are moved. You are talking about competing with Gibraltar, Amsterdam and London. Doing exactly what? And why in Cadiz?

Reading your full comment I would understand that you are talking about making it a fiscal heaven. Am I misunderstanding something?

If you are talking about brokers for stock-market. Spain has already 4 stock-markets and it's probably too many, the one at Valencia is dying and the one at Bilbao is not exactly healthy and would die without the Basque fiscal agreement.

Stock markets are privatized anyway if somebody wants to create another at Spain they can. But I think that it's more likely that one closes.


&gt;  Give the region fiscal autonomy and give Gibraltar, amsterdam and London a run for their money.

 Basque Country already has fiscal autonomy and Catalonia asked for it at 2011(and after it was denied the ruling right wing nationalist coalition started to push for independence.

The only practical difference has been that the corporate tax is exactly 2% lower than the rest of Spain, following closely any reform at Spain. And they don't participate in the national cohesion funds anymore, keeping for themselves like 5% of the GDP that they would have to contribute if they had the same status as Catalonia.


And this is a completely different situation, the locals would refuse any fiscal autonomy. Andalusia and specially Cadiz are funding a big part of their budget from transfers from wealthier regions. If they get fiscal autonomy how are they going to pay the schools and hospitals? It's not like they have an economy to tax.

Ich bin seit mittlerweile 2 Wochen im 5. Semester. Nachdem ich im 4. Semester 2 Klausuren in den Sand gesetzt hatte, musste ich sie diese Woche nachschreiben, bzw. durch die Prüfungsordnung insgesamt 3 Klausuren. Gefühlt lief das alles soweit so gut, dass ich auf jeden Fall weiterhin studieren kann.

Von einem Dozenten habe ich das Angebot bekommen, am Ende des 6. Semesters ein Empfehlungsschreiben zu bekommen, bei einem anderen bin ich gerade dran. Gerade in meinem (hoffentlich) zukünftigen Berufsfeld ist das kein schlechter Start. 

Für meine Studienarbeit habe ich diese Woche eine teure Softwarelizenz bewilligt bekommen, was auch ziemlich cool ist.

Mein Französischkurs hat diese Woche begonnen, von März bis Juli habe ich den B1.1 Kurs gemacht, jetzt mache ich B1.2, um eines Tages auf einem akzeptablen Niveau zu sein. Da ich Französisch in der Schule einfach nur gehasst habe, bin ich relativ stolz darauf, dass ich das jetzt noch mal ordentlich lerne.

Oh, und in genau 4 Wochen habe ich meinen 20. Geburtstag. Im Moment läuft eigentlich alles zu gut um wahr zu sein.

Das Wochenende habe ich mit Netflix und mit meiner Familie verbracht, endlich mal wieder ein wenig ausschlafen und gut essen gehen war echt nötig.

 * In Genoa heavy rains caused floods and widespread damage, killing one person. Since this already happened 3 years ago, almost in the same way, people are quite pissed off since a bunch of safety measures (such as shoring up river banks) were promised, but nothing happened. It turns out that all the works were indeed scheduled and financed, but were also stuck in a clusterfuck of bureaucracy, lawsuits and tender rules, so nothing was actually done. Among protests, volunteers and the poor church cardinal whose house was damaged, the government is promising that this time, definitely, something will be done against too much bureaucracy.

 * In an effort to encourage job creation the government wants to change labor laws, removing the historical protections that prevented easy employee terminations. This has the unions up to arms, together with the leftmost portions of the government parties. Renzi however doesn't really want to stall the reforms, so he's forcing the law through with confidence votes and the support of the right. The left-wing party, whose leader is also Renzi, is now facing an internal revolt and strikes are being organized. However since a good deal of youths have no job and therefore don't really care about termination protections protests might not be large enough this time around.

 * After another mayor allowed the registration of a same-sex wedding performed abroad the (right wing) interior minister issued a directive that required all mayors to cancel any such existing registrations. Most mayors that allowed them refused, stating that it wouldn't be constitutional. In the meantime a catholic-right wing group called 'Standing watchers' organized a demonstration by placing people standing still reading a book in several major squares to protest against the addition of 'sexual orientation' to an anti-discrimination law, since they want to be free to state that homosexuality is a disease. Turnout was low, but it enticed left-wing and LGBT organization to counter-protest and it ended with fights, making the 'standing watchers' the victims. Italy remains the only country in western Europe without any law about same-sex unions, since nobody is able to agree upon what kind of law to make.

false,ggow,SCOT,Scotland,"&gt;The price would be a full, free and fair referendum on our continued membership of the European Union: the opportunity to get our country back. And for that to happen quickly.

You cannot have a 'full, free, and fair' referendum with little more than two months to discuss all of the consequences, ramifications, and practicalities of such a large change. It would not be a full referendum, and it would not be free, as its legitimacy would be diminished and bound by ignorance that will require a long, involved, national, discuss to lift. 

If I were being cynical, I'd say there are a number of reasons for such a move:

1) The Conservatives promised referendum in 2017 is quite far away, relatively speaking. By 'de-risking' the vote for the core group of europhobes, in terms of the vote, he can take the legs out from underneath the Conservatives pledge. 

2) The media have been complicit in bashing the EU for every negative thing it does, and not really giving it a fair hearing. In the context of a referendum, however, where the consequences are actually leaving the EU, they're likely to be much more responsible and balanced in their coverage. The 'damage' will take a long time to un-do, however, so pulling it to July 2015, as opposed to 2017, will not allow the media to change opinions against Farage. 

3) UKIP, in 2015, will likely be at the height of their political support; untainted by the realities of Government and untainted by the reality that they can't be all things to all men. All of this would sap their party grass-roots activists morale. Striking while the iron is hot would continue that on. 

4) This point is perhaps subject to my own biases, since I believe the facts support continued-EU membership, but having two months to discuss this is going to work in the Europhobe's favour. You cannot write complicated discussion papers, publish them, have rallies, and town-hall meetings, and so on in the space of two months. You cannot expect the electorate to consume all the information thrown at them, digest it, and come to an informed opinion in that time frame. It can take months to disprove a red herring, so we need time to consider it e.g. it would be shocking for the UK to vote to leave only to find out in the break up negotiations that, actually, we were wrongly informed on how the legal relationship would end up and no, we won't be getting this that and the next thing. 

5) I think Farage is scared of how his MPs are going to be behaving after they're elected. They have a hard time keeping their members in line at the moment, it's going to be difficult to do likewise with possible 10-25 MP's, to keep their opinions and speech 'acceptable'. This will work against UKIP, since the allegations that they're 'just racist' will be hard to refute when there have been numerous scandals around racism in their small delegation to Westminster. (Of course, I could be wrong and they might get their part discipline in order and manage to root out the racists.)

6) Having the vote early precludes the possibility of a renegotiation taking place. IF there are some reforms passed, many in the UK will think 'well, I might have voted to leave but we'll see how these turn out, we can always have another referendum'. For Farage, no reform could make the EU worth staying in, so he'll never be happy with that regardless of how good the reforms are. 

7) I imagine, well hope, that the EZ and EU will have managed to get their shit together, in some semblance or another, re: the economy come 2017. 2015, too close to call. In 2017, the UK should have a deeply embedded recovery with living standards starting to rise strongly again. In 2015, living standards might be rather moribund, as they are now. If people are economically happy with their situation on they day, they won't want to rock the boat. Farage will want to exploit the dis affectation felt the maximum, which means exploiting it now.

false,_chwax_,null,null,"Un bouquin qui m'a appris énormément. Ce que j'en ai retenu c'est qu'au moment où la Révolution a éclaté, les jeux étaient déjà faits depuis longtemps et qu'ils étaient en défaveur de la noblesse. 

Une noblesse que Tocqueville décrit comme devenue parfaitement inutile et parasitaire : elle vit à la ville dans l'opulence que lui confèrent ses titres de propriété et ne s'occupe plus de ses terres, tout en gênant la propriété des paysans par ces mêmes titres. Comme le dit Tocqueville, les paysans en ont assez de payer pour des inutiles qu'ils ne voient jamais et dont ils n'ont plus besoin depuis belle lurette. Alors leur cramer leur château, à partir de là .. Ainsi que les gras ecclésiastiques ...  :D

 
Je trouve que le moyen-Âge avait sa beauté propre et sa logique formelle, c'est-à-dire l'équilibre des pouvoirs entre la noblesse et le pouvoir central. Eh bien, le pouvoir central a fini par gagner. 

La leçon à retenir de tout ça, c'est que c'est parce que le pouvoir royal français souhaitait se renforcer et unifier le royaume (pic sous Louis XIV) qu'il a volontairement volé dans les plumes de la noblesse, d'abord en l'attirant à la Cour du roi donc loin de ses terres, puis en la mettant en concurrence avec les élites issues de la bourgeoisie qui ont gagné leur accès dans l'administration royale (noblesse de robe avec des roturiers).
 
 
Donc au final l'ancien Régime c'est avant tout l'histoire du long déclin de la noblesse au profit du pouvoir central, il me semble.

I don't think so. Or maybe it is. I guess in English you have words that are spelled the same, but pronounced differently (e.g. read/read). I can't think of anything like that in German right now. Although the opposite case, where words are pronounced the same way, but spelled differently occurs quite often. 

So I guess English might be worse in that regard. 

Although I always intuitively thought that the irregularities in the language, while irregular, still follow some form of pattern or at least form groups. To illustrate what I mean: irregular verbs such as catch, buy, etc., where the past tense is caught/bought instead of catched/buyed. I can't exactly pinpoint it, but I do feel some sort of pattern there. 

&gt; I think neither language is better. I prefer the simplicity of the lack of cases and the lack of multiple articles in English.

Vorher schön beim Griechen essen gewesen, dann Kaffee trinken zuhause.

nach so eins zwei Bier kam die Diskussion über Ausländer in Deutschland auf und wie sehr die bösen Immigranten doch unsere Kultur infiltrieren und uns ihren Glaube und ihre Lebensweise aufzwingen wollen.

Nun bin ich, auch durch den Freundeskreis, eher Linksliberal habe aber auch Meinungen, die manche vielleicht als eher rechts einstufen aber was bei diesen Diskussionen so ans Tageslicht kam ließ mich eigentlich ziemlich erschrecken.

Zum einen wurde stark pauschalisiert, alle Ausländer sind faul und gleich etc.

Einmal kam sogar die Frage ob ich jetzt eine Türkische Freundin hätte, weil ich für Kopftücher auf der Straße bin?!

Ausländer haben sich gefälligst anzupassen, kein Islam in Deutschland.

false,inadaptado,null,null,"I have some second-hand experience (property was not mine but I was involved in the process) so I will advise as best as a can.

Let's start by the truth: it's a risk. There is no way around it. Once you are out of your home you lose control and anything could happen. It could get trashed, or robbed, or burned down, or who knows. Usually nothing really bad happens, but at the very least it's common to suffer minor damages (accidental or not). In the end everything can be fixed with money, but if you are the kind that worries too much or don't have some cash to spare I wouldn't even try.

If you do want to try, I would like to offer you some advice:

- Make sure you comply with your local laws. The hospitality industry is pressing hard to kill amateur holiday lettings, and several places already have legislation forcing to register and pay a hefty fee to be allowed to do it.

- Ask for the money upfront, keep a detailed inventory (up to the last teaspoon) and document the whole process, from start to finish, so you can be protected against claims. Spaniards may not be used to haggling but they do love a bargain and some people might complain if they think that will get them some money back. Other people are just dicks who don't give a shit about anything, so I would also make sure to be insured as well.

- Keep in mind it's a business, so you are competing against others. If you ask for too much money, or your house is not attractive, or you don't provide a good service, you might find yourself without any offers. I would make some research first to see what kind of holidaymakers go to that area, what they are looking for, and how much they are willing to pay. And, of course, make sure you advertise in as many places you can.

If you keep in control of the whole process and maintain a professional attitude you will minimize the risks and might end up earning good money (particularly if there is any kind of famous festivities, fair or event in the area; you can ask for the moon during those days!).

P.S. Beware of letting the house out to groups of friends looking forward to celebrate something (birthday, graduation, hens/stags, etc..), particularly if young.

Glücklicherweise ist meine Familie extrem, nunja, liberal bzw. offen, oder besser gesagt, realistisch. Pauschalisierungen und Populismus trifft bei uns auf keinen fruchtbaren Boden, aber andererseits reden wir eher selten über sowas. Eltern sind vor allem deshalb abgeklärt, weil aus der DDR - da hat man nicht sofort Existenzängste wenn mal jemand an der Tradition rüttelt. 

Populär ist Populismus, weil er einerseits simpel zu verstehen ist (Ausländer kommen rein -&gt; Wohlstand und Sicherheit gehen raus) und meist so gehalten, dass er schwer zu widerlegen ist, mit diesen einfachen abstrakten Phrasen. Teilweise fußt es auch auf Wahrheiten, die aber Ursache und Wirkung vertauschen. Beispiel: Ausländerviertel und Kriminalität. Rechtspopulismus sagt: Alle Ausländer sind kriminell, deshalb dort hohe Kriminalität. Realität sagt: oft (nicht immer) wenig Perspektive für dortige Bevölkerung, ergo alternative Beschaffungsmethoden. Die Ghettoisierung (vor allem auch weiter unterstützt von den Populisten) trägt auch dazu bei, dass Parellelgesellschaften entstehen, die gegenseitiges Unverständnis und fehlenden Respekt zur Folge haben. 

Grundlegend kann man immer sagen: Dem gut situierten Bürger ist alles suspekt, was von der Norm abweicht. Ob sich dies in Ausländerfeindlichkeit oder simples Misstrauen manifestiert, hängt von jedem selbst ab.

Two **private bloggers** also [had to remove](http://yle.fi/uutiset/officials_deny_general_whisky_banbut_whisky_fair_cant_call_itself_that/7524224) any references to the word ""whisky"" from their posts about the upcoming event.

There is this lovely little bit from Wiki.

&gt;The Government of Northern Cyprus estimates that the 1983 population of Northern Cyprus was 155,521.[95] Estimates by the government of the Republic of Cyprus from 2001 place the population at 200,000, of which 80–89,000 are Turkish Cypriots and 109,000–117,000 Turkish settlers.[96] An island-wide census in 1960 indicated the number of Turkish Cypriots as 102,000 and Greek Cypriots as 450,000.[97] Estimates state that 36,000 Turkish Cypriots (about one-third of the total) emigrated in the period 1975–1995, with the consequence that within Northern Cyprus the native Turkish Cypriots have been outnumbered by settlers from Turkey.[96]
Northern Cyprus's first official census was performed in 1996. The population recorded was 200,587.[98] The second census, carried out in 2006, revealed the population of Northern Cyprus to be 265,100,[99] of which majority is composed of indigenous Turkish Cypriots, with the rest including a large number of settlers from Turkey. Of the 178,000 Turkish Cypriot citizens, 82% are native Cypriots (145,000). Of the 45,000 people born to non- Cypriot parentage, nearly 40% (17,000) were born in Cyprus. The figure for non-citizens, including students, guest workers and temporary residents stood at 78,000 people.[99][100]


&gt;One source claims that the population in the north has reached 500,000,[101] split between 50% Turkish Cypriots and 50% Turkish settlers or Cypriot-born children of such settlers.[102]
The third official census of Northern Cyprus was carried out in 2011, made under the auspices of UN observers. It returned a total population of 294,906.[103] These results were disputed by some political parties, labour unions and local newspapers. The government was accused of deliberately under-counting the population, after apparently giving an estimate of 700,000 before the census, in order to demand financial help from Turkey.[104][105][106] Northern Cyprus is almost entirely Turkish-speaking. English, however, is widely spoken as a second language.[citation needed]
There are 644 Greek Cypriots living in Rizokarpaso (Dipkarpaz) and 364 Maronites in Kormakitis.[107] Between 180,000 to 200,000 Greek Cypriots were forcibly evicted from their homes in the North by the invading force of the Turkish army.[108][109][110] Rizokarpaso is the home of the biggest Greek-speaking population in the north. The Greek-Cypriot inhabitants are still supplied by the UN, and Greek-Cypriot products are consequently available in some shops.[citation needed]",0,1413143281,null,0,1413143671,0,cl7kj0k,t3_2iz9s9,t1_cl7kj0k,t1_cl7k9ii,null,1426561898,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

false,TheAppleManSam,UNSA,Dirty South,"&gt;Similarities between the euro region and Japan are intensifying, heaping pressure on Mario Draghi while offering good news for bond holders.

&gt;Sluggish credit growth? Check. Slowing economy? Check. Falling market expectations for inflation? Check. Aging population? Yes, it has that too, placing Europe in a similar situation to what was encountered by the world’s third-largest economy after the bubble burst on its postwar Economic Miracle.

&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;With the official interest rate near zero, bond investors say European Central Bank President Draghi may need to do more to steer the region away from the deflation and debt traps that condemned Japan to two decades of stagnation.

&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;Europe should be on a roll. It’s never been cheaper for euro-area governments or individuals to borrow money and the ECB is seeking to put cash into the economy through cheap loans to banks and a pledge to buy asset-backed securities.

&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;**Bund Yields**

&gt;The rate on benchmark German bunds was 0.96 percent as of 2:19 p.m. London time and touched a record 0.866 percent last month. Spanish yields fell to 2.039 percent earlier this month, from 7.751 percent just before Draghi boosted confidence in the region with a pledge in July 2012 to do *“whatever it takes”* to save the euro. This month, the ECB lowered the main interest rate to 0.05 percent. Officials are forecast to keep the rate unchanged in their next policy decision on Oct. 2.

&gt;Yet there is little evidence any benefits are feeding through to the economy.

&gt;Euro-area growth stagnated in the second quarter and data today showed inflation slowed to 0.3 percent this month, a fraction of the ECB’s goal of just under 2 percent. The central bank’s preferred measure of medium-term inflation expectations is near a four-year low.

&gt;------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;**Declining Costs**

&gt;Although declining costs for everything from transport and food to clothes can be good news for consumers, disinflation -- or slowing inflation -- makes it harder for borrowers to pay off debts and for businesses to boost profits. Under deflation, or falling prices, households may postpone purchases and companies may delay investment and hiring as demand for their products dries up.

&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;**Bubble Burst**

&gt;Since Japan’s real estate and stock market bubble burst in the early 1990s, companies have focused on cutting debt and shifting manufacturing overseas. Wages stagnated and consumers reined in spending. That led to two decades with no nominal growth in the economy. Prices of goods kept falling, creating deflation that sapped optimism.

&gt;Euro-region inflation expectations, as measured by five-year consumer-price swaps, have fallen and stayed below those of Japan since March this year. M3 money supply, a broad measure of liquidity, grew 2 percent in August. That’s less than half the average of 5 percent in the past 10 years, and below the 4 percent threshold that characterized the Japanese deflation experience in the past two decades, according to JPMorgan.

&gt;Adding to the mix of constrained credit conditions, a high level of debt and low growth in Europe, a fifth of German, Italian, and Greek people are older than 65, up from around 15 percent in 1991, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Japan has the biggest proportion of older people, with those over 65 accounting for 25 percent of its population.

&gt;Shifting demographics mean more consumers in these countries will no longer be producers, placing further headwinds on growth.",0,1413144160,null,0,false,0,cl7kzlz,t3_2j1voe,t1_cl7kzlz,t3_2j1voe,null,1426561683,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Lusitania was a name of a province of the Roman Empire part of Hispania it was name after the Lusitani, an ethnicity of the people that used to live on that land.

So it would be terrible wrong for us Portuguese to treat us like Lusitania right? Kinda, the same way that Castillians adopted the term Spain we adopted the term Lusitania, now geographically there are some parts of Portugal that are not even part of Lusitania and others that are not even part of Portugal.

Conclusion the same way that people from Badajoz will reject the term Lusitanian to refer to their City we do reject the term Spain to refer to our land Portugal, doesn't mean we are both wrong.

Portugal is part of Spain, geographically speaking the same way that Badajoz is part of Lusitania, geographically speaking. But the descendants of  people from Badajoz are not Luso-descendentes and the people from Portugal are not Spanish.

Another great example is that a Portuguese Speaker is called a Lusophone, pretty ridiculous when the Portuguese Language has it's roots in Galicia that wasn't even part of Portugal and worse it is far away from Lusitania. Still this is the correct term and it should be used as it is.
