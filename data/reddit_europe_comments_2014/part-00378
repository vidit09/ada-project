false,Louis_de_Lasalle,ITAL,Italy,"Honestly I am sympathetic, most of the immigrants coming here are fleeing from horrible countries, these are people willing to put their life savings, and their lives themselves to cross the Mediterranean in a boat and find a home here.

But on the other hand, I must be honest with myself and concede that I was born into a wealthy family, have enjoyed what would be called an upper class and sheltered life, and am ignorant of the plight of the working classes. What I do know is that these immigrants are all placed in the working class areas, where different cultural values seem to clash furiously, and cause many of our own people to feel abandoned within their own nations, and the immigrants compete with them for the same jobs which are already scarce.

I think we must be pragmatic. There is a clear and sizeable portion of the populace who is willing to vote whoever proposes to end immigration and restore to them their own sense of home and country; and there those even willing to use violence to achieve these aims. The problem is that none of the centre right or centre left parties is willing to promise or care about this issue, and so this sizeable portion of the peoples is starting to vote and support for the only kind of parties which are willing to make this issue their main platform; to wit, far rightists and semi fascists. This is troubling and to be honest somewhat scary.

My pragmatic opinion is that the centre parties must do what I feel to be ethically wrong, begin to deport the people who risked everything to come here and create a dignified and safe life. They must do this, because if they do not, the alternative is clear, the far right parties will gain momentum and may even win an election, and then not only will they deport, they will do so in a cruel manner and couples it with authoritarian grabs of power and backwards social policies.

Dennoch hat er eine eigene Position und die versuche ich zu verstehen. Er macht ja auch keinen Hehl daraus: er hat seine politische Position und vertritt sie ganz offen. Der Joffe steht 100% hinter dem was er sagt. Das ist einfach sein Weltbild. So simpel es klingt.

Man sollte die Leute also nicht gleich als Marionette des bösen xyz-Feindbilds abstempeln. Stattdessen hilft es einfach mal zu versuchen das politische Gegenüber zu verstehen. Zumindest versuchen. Das ist einfach eine der fundamentalsten Diskussionsgrundlagen.

&gt; Gli antispecisti duri sono ovviamente del ""partito"" patocentrico o biocentrico.

No! Antispecismo, biocentrismo, patocentrismo sono tre concetti diversi e non intercambiabili.

Esempi (e definizioni):

Per un sostenitore del patocentrismo la vita di una medusa non ha la stessa importanza di quella di un'anatra. Dato che l'anatra ha un sistema nervoso e sente dolore, mentre la medusa no. **Questo è il patocentrismo: ""assegnare agli animali superiori diritti pari all’uomo, come non soffrire o non essere uccisi"".** (cito dall'articolo che linkavi)

L'antispecista ti dirà che invece tu, specie Homo sapiens sapiens, non hai nessun diritto di togliere la vita ad una Cyanea capillata, volgarmente detta ""medusa criniera di leone"". **Questo è l'antispecismo: ""ogni essere senziente possiede diritti esistenziali che dovrebbero essere riconosciuti dall'umanità, indipendentemente dal loro modo di vivere, ovviamente diverso da quello umano.""** (cito da it.wiki)

**Il biocentrista invece ti dirà che non solo devi lasciar stare l'anatra e la medusa, ma non devi nemmeno abbattere l'albero.** Sto semplificando, ma non così tanto da confondere le acque.

Also, wir sind uns wahrscheinlich alle einig, dass in in der islamischen Gemeinde destruktive und schnellstens zu behende Tendenzen gibt. Das können auch genug ""Insider"" so unterschreiben. Gerne sind das auch Tendenzen, die in der Stärke nicht in der christlichen Basis zu finden sind. Dafür haben die hier einheimischen ""Christen"" wohl andere Lieblingsressentiments, da bin Ich mir sicher.

Um zum Punkt zu kommen: Du glaubst doch nicht, dass das Milieu aus dem die PEGIDA und dieser Rattenschwanz stammt ausschließlich gegen fundamentalistische Moslems ist? Das ist wie immer bei diesen Bewegungen ein Vehikel um Xenophobie, bzw einfach schon die diffusen Ängste der Bürger zu bündeln und auf irgendein imaginäres Feindbild zu projezieren.

Jedenfalls brauchen wir ja nicht so zu tun, als wär so ein Bündnis und dessen ganzer Kontext irgendwie neuartig.

* Denmark will submit its formal claim on territory in the North Pole region on Monday. The claim is based on geological surveys of the Lomonosov ridge that's connected to Greenland and extends under the North Pole.

 Russia and Canada are also expected to submit overlapping claims. A UN commission will then investigate the scientific basis for the claims after which the three countries (+ US and Norway if they make any claims) will have to negotiate the actual borders.

 The area claimed is more than twenty times larger than Denmark proper (not including Greenland).

* A report on conditions for returning Eritrean refugees has caused a lot of discussion as even the people behind the data gathering for the report disagree with its conclusions. Conveniently, it concludes that there would be no problem sending refugees back to the dictatorship.

 Had it not been disowned by pretty much everyone, the report could have been used to order the expulsion of Eritrean refugees.

 This reeks of an overeager bureaucrat trying to fiddle with the results  to achieve a certain political outcome. Whether or not he was told to do so by the (former) justice minister remains to be seen.

 * [Source](http://www.thelocal.dk/20141210/denmark-doubts-controversial-eritrea-report).

* A close approach by a Russian fighter plane caused a passenger plane from Copenhagen en route to Poland to divert its course slightly, and a couple of Danish fighter jets went to the area to keep track of things.

 The Russian jet did nothing illegal, but flying that close to other airplanes in international airspace with your transponder turned off is just downright irresponsible.

false,cokkish,ITAL,Italy,"&gt; Migration to Sweden exploded after WW2 -

That's exactly what I said. War isn't the only thing that motivates immigration. Economical gain is still the primary cause behind it and always will be. 

&gt; In most recent days there are more immigrants, but nothing much different from what we seen in the past

Not only is the number of immigrants important, but where they come from. The influx of, say Germans, in 70's doesn't have the same impact  of Turks or Syrians on the native society.

Moreover the most striking fact that we gather from the graphic is the constant spiking up. That creates a sum effect on the total immigrant population.

That makes the situation remarkably different from what we saw in the past.

&gt; Without immigrants the cost of construction, gastronomy, plumbing etc. would have been much higher as there would not be enough Swedes to cover those positions, which inflates the wages.

That would mean there'd be Swedish plummers who make good money. That's all. It would be a way to elevate the lower class jobs to higher wages and thus virtually lessen the wage-gap. 

I'm not saying immigrants are worthless (they in fact contribute to a country's wealth in many senses).

But I see them more as a favour to the richest fringes of the society who can keep making good profit over a newly introduces bottom of the barrel once even the native underprivileged chunk of the population has jumped up a little too high in the food chain to be properly exploited.

This is all while most of the native population doesn't get a direct advantage from it that they wouldn't have without that many immigrants other than maybe taking a small part in this exploitation through lower plumming bills. 

They may however experience discomfort: mostly alienation to a perceived invasion, a sense of unsafety even; as long as they feel like the immigrants are more apt to commit crimes. Others still might even rejoice in the multicultural richness they can now live first hand.

At last this influx of the new poor is the restoration of a lost balanced, but it's arguably the best balance possible.

Had he been willing to work &amp; cooperate with former regime men, be a little more morally flexible, than we might not be in this mess to begin with &amp; Iraq wouldn't of had to wait nearly half-a-decade till Patraeus got on the scene with a troop surge backing him up &amp; a commitment to winning over Sunni tribal leaders *(big bags of money playing no small part)* so Al-Qaeda could be routed as their support eroded *(which wouldn't of even been a problem in the first place had the previous incompetent bullshit not taken place)* and the situation could actually stabilize. 

Unfortunately we weren't committed to staying another decade to cement those gains. Meh.

Dick Cheney can burn in hell. I might dislike Bremer for his incompetence, but I fucking hate Cheney. He was competent. There's no denying it.

Although all of this kinda supports my point. There was a moral obligation to remove Saddam, like there was with Gaddafi. But the approach was flawed, like you pointed out with Libya. If we had went in there without justifying it with WMDs based on shitty intel, and been more competent about the occupation with anybody fucking else other than Bremer, things could be very different.

By that I mean you should strive to understand German words by themselves rather than their English translations.

I'm guessing the biggest difficulty with you is the word order, since the verb will often come at the end of the sentence. Again, this is just something you need to get used to. I was lucky in that I studied Latin--where verbs are almost always placed at the end of the sentence, since word order doesn't generally matter--before German, so I was already used to anticipating the verb at the end of the sentence.

The reason why *""Es war jemand da""* totally works is because of the *da*.

You can say ""Jemand war da"" to mean ""someone was there"".

However, you can't just say ""Jemand war"" to say that someone exists, just like you can't say ""Someone was"" in English as a complete sentence.

A statement of existence contains the ""Es gibt/gab"" construction. The ""es war"" construction works as long as the statement *could be* rearranged without the ""es"" and still make sense. For whatever reason, the speaker wanted to delay some of the information and thus started the sentence with ""es"", which is just a sort of dummy element.",0,1418611617,null,0,false,0,cmv4xdq,t3_2pbiry,t1_cmv4xdq,t3_2pbiry,null,1425429583,1,false,German,t5_2qq51,1

false,newappeal,advanced-english,advanced (native English),"Think of the ""es gibt x"" construction (literally ""it gives x"") as saying ""x exists"". When you ask ""Gibt es Wein?"" you're asking if there is any wine present. Alternatively, if you ask ""Ist der Wein da?"", you know that there's wine somewhere around there, but you want to know if *the* wine is *there* specifically. You could therefore ask ""Gibt es jemanden (da)?"" to ask if someone exists in a more general context, for instance, if you're drunk at a bar, you might ask ""Gibt es jemanden, der mich nach Hause bringen kann?"" to mean ""Is there someone who can take me home?"". In this case, you don't really care about that person's precise location, just whether or not there exists someone who can take you home. Alternatively, if you hear a knock at the door, you might call, ""Ist jemand da?"" to mean ""Is someone there?"", as you are in this case asking not if the person exists, but if they are standing in front of your door.

A simpler (though less precise) explanation might be that when *is/are/was/etc...* and *there* are next to each other in the English sentence, you should use the ""es gibt/gab"" expression, while when the *there* is not next to the form of *to be*, you probably want to translate literally, using *da/dort* and a form of *sein*.

[**Libya: Can Britain and France really run this conflict?**](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/concoughlin/8399184/Libya-Can-Britain-and-France-really-run-this-conflict.html)

&gt;We've only been at war for four days, but already serious divisions have appeared within the coalition leadership over how to prosecute the campaign. It is easy to understand Barack Obama's reluctance to play a lead role in a conflict he didn't want in the first place. This was one war that America didn't want.

&gt;Britain and France may have made all the running in drumming up international support for a no-fly zone. So if London and Paris are so keen to confront Gaddafi, why don't they run the campaign? After all, it was only at the end of last year that the British and French governments signed a new defence cooperation pact, whereby they agreed to cooperate more closely on military issues. The French even agreed to allow us the use of one of their aircraft carriers – assuming, that is, we had the aircraft to fly off it.

&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;Fast forward two decades and the Americans are once more doing the lion's share of the combat operations. Of the 100 or so missions launched since the UN authorised military action at the end of last week, at least half have been undertaken by the US. The rest have been divided between the British and the French. To date, all combat operations have taken place under American command, with General Carter Ham directly the opening salvoes of the coalition effort.

&gt;But unlike recent coalition campaigns in Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan, Libya is different. This time, Mr Obama and his generals can't wait for the opportunity to hand over responsibility for the mission to someone else. As one senior US officer told me yesterday: *""The Europeans wanted the no-fly zone; so the Europeans can command the no-fly zone.""*

&gt;The only problem with this neat solution is that, as is so often the case when dealing with a major security issue, *""the Europeans""* just can't agree on how the command structure should be run.

[**Libya, Europe and the future of NATO: Always waiting for the U.S. Cavalry**](http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2011/06/libya-europe-and-fuure-nato)

&gt;America was visibly reluctant to get involved, let alone lead the action. And, having helped to knock out Libya's air defences and conduct some of the initial air-to-ground strikes, it pulled back from the front-line operations. But America's role remains essential, not least in providing air-to-air refuelling, as well as intelligence and reconnaissance for the European allies.

[**NATO Commander: EU could not do Libya without US**](http://euobserver.com/defence/115650)

&gt;NATO Major-General Marcel Druart, addressing the European Parliament committee on security and defence on Tuesday (20 March), said NATO relied heavily on US military expertise on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.

&gt;*The U.S. military has spent about $1 billion on Libya’s revolution, and secretly helped NATO with everything from munitions to surveillance aircraft. John Barry provides an exclusive look at Obama’s emerging 'covert intervention' strategy.*

&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;The U.S. military has spent about $1 billion so far and played a far larger role in Libya than it has acknowledged, quietly implementing an emerging *""covert intervention""* strategy that the Obama administration hopes will let America fight small wars with a barely detectable footprint. 

&gt;Officially, President Obama handed the lead role of ousting Muammar Gaddafi to the European members of NATO. For this he was criticized by Washington war hawks who suggested that Europeans working with a ragtag team of Libyan rebels was a recipe for stalemate, not victory. 

&gt;But behind the scenes, the U.S. military played an indispensable role in the Libya campaign, deploying far more forces than the administration chose to advertise. And at NATO headquarters outside Brussels, the U.S. was intimately involved in all decisions about how the Libyan rebels should be supported as they rolled up control of cities and oil refineries and marched toward the capital, Tripoli.",0,1418617465,null,0,1418619697,0,cmv80rv,t3_2paqbv,t1_cmv80rv,t1_cmv7ifn,null,1425427689,-6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-6

we conduct two separate investigations - one Persecutor's office, one Parliamentary committee.  

Parliamentary committee makes its findings public, says there were quite a few of mysterious flights in the period of 2004-2006, some rumours about someone getting paid bigtime, but no hard enough proof of anything more than that. 

Persecutor's office doesn't make almost nothing public, but they too discontinue the investigation after some time. 

US Senate then releases their investigation, where they repeat almost word-by-word everything our initial investigation found (among other things, which may or may not be related to Lithuania). 

US media draws conclusion that since both investigations has some matching points, it means Lithuania = torture prison. 

now, can someone assure me that US Senate didn't just copypaste these matching points from our Parliamentary investigation? it's probably nothing wrong with that if they did, it's just, we are in this situation because we made our findings public. not every other country did. so it's very easy for media to see these coincidences and then paint these maps, when actually, no other source is pointing to Lithuania, actually name Lithuania is not even mentioned.

might it be true, might have Lithuania had torture prison on its soil? possible. is it proven? absolutely not, not even near that.

My book actually says it's the case anytime you have two infinitives + an auxillary, so not just with modals which is strong than what I said... Maybe with joggen, joggen isn't treated/considered an infinitive? I took some pictures real quick, because I'm genuinely unsure of why it wouldn't work with OP's, but does work here.

My book is Handbuch zur deutschen Grammatik (if that makes a difference)

http://i.imgur.com/83QlTff.jpg?1  (see edit at bottom)

http://i.imgur.com/77i0RJL.jpg  (relevant part is point 4 at the bottom)

And I double checked Hammer's guide just to make sure (though my other textbook is quite modern)

http://i.imgur.com/x0Pz9S3.jpg?1  (see edit at bottom)

Also, I reread the rule you wrote earlier and wouldn't

&gt;Drittletzte Stelle: konjugiertes Hilfsverb

belie what you were saying. Doesn't that mean that the conjugated verb comes before the two infinitives?

---------

Not trying to be a jerk, maybe I am misunderstanding the sources or there is a difference. I'm genuinely just not sure, because I thought I understood a rule here (clearly I didn't) and now I'm trying to understand what the actual rule in these situations is.

So basically if I'm understanding correctly, in most cases where you have a conjugated helping verb + two infinitives in a relative clause it would be:

    [dass] [...] [3.letzte]             [2.letzte]    [letzte]
    [dass] [...] [conjugated verb] [infinitive 1] [infinitive 2]

Ich weiß jetzt grad nicht was trauriger ist. Das manche Idioten eine billige Hetzschrift die fast nur auf Diffamierung und persönlichen Angriffen besteht schon für differenziert und **intellektuell** (mit 2x Doppel-L) halten, oder das hier:

&gt;Die Regierungsbeteiligung der Nazis wird so oft wiederholt, dass man schon einen im Gesicht sitzen hat

Wenn sich hier in Deutschland auch nur jemand dafür ausspricht Migrantenfamilien zu mehr Integrationsleistung aufzufordern, dann wird der Nazivorwurf so lange wiederholt, bis sich die Person aus dem öffentlichen Leben verabschiedet hat. Die Systempresse ist dieses Vorwurfs durch ihre Leser und objektive Kommentatoren indes überdrüssig, wie kommen die nur dazu auf die Wahrheit hinzuweisen? So schlimm sind die Nazis dort doch gar nicht, richtig?

Es ist schlicht nur noch peinlich. Der Fakt, dass sowas als gute Kritik gilt lässt tief blicken. Manche leben mittlerweile eben zusammen mit diesen ""Journalisten"" die solchen Müll schreiben in einer fremden Realität. Passend dazu Roland Tichy:

&gt;Wir suchen uns neue Leser, die alten sind reaktionär

&gt;Für die gedruckte Presse aber beschleunigt das ganze den eigenen Untergang. Denn sollen die Leute wirklich lesen, dass sie alle Volltrottel im harmlosesten Sinn oder aber sogar bösartige Nazis sind? Das Verhalten vieler meiner Kollegen erinnert an die bitterböse Parabel, die Bert Brecht nach dem Niederschlagen des Volksaufstands in der DDR in seinem wunderschönen Band “Buckower Elegien”geschrieben hat: “Das Volk hat das Vertrauen der Regierung verscherzt. Wäre es da nicht doch einfacher, die Regierung löste das Volk auf und wählte ein anderes?” 

&gt;Die Zeitungen haben offensichtlich beschlossen, sich neue Leser zu wählen, weil ihnen die noch vorhandenen nicht klug, nicht links, nicht grün und überhaupt nicht modern genug sind. Dazu passt, dass die Süddeutsche ihre Kommentarfunktion im Internet schließt und die ARD dies für die Tagesschau erwägt. Lesermeinungen sind einfach zu dumm für die Inhaber des erhobenen Zeigefingers. Alle fürchten sich vor dem Internet. Aber es ist die Verachtung der Leser, die zur Kündigung des Abos führt.

Ich fand nur eine Wiederholung der in der Sendung getroffenen Aussagen und deren Zurückweisung als ""Märchen"" und ""Schablonenhaftes Schwarz-Weiß-Denken ohne intellektuelle Differenzierung"" vom ""Salonbolschewisten"" Uthoff. Statt inhaltlicher Auseinandersetzung also nur Diskreditierung mit dem üblichen moralischen Gestus des Besserwissers, der es merkwürdig findet, ""dass das Publikum gar nicht merkt, für wie blöd es gehalten wird.""

Einzige Aussnahme: 

&gt;Dass durch diese Personalie das innerukrainische Korruptionsproblem angegangen werden soll, dürfte für Uthoff eine Lüge der US-amerikanisch gesteuerten ""Qualitätspresse"" sein.

Hier wird die Personalie Jaresko als Korruptionsbekämpfungsmaschine beschrieben (und gleichzeitig Herrn Uthoff wieder etwas unterstellt). Dies ist zumindest eine mögliche Sichtweise. Die andere - dass es nämlich eine bemerkenswerte Nähe zur US-Politik und IWF-Finanzwelt im neuen ukrainischen Kabinett gibt, die Fragen über dessen Unabhängigkeit aufwirft - ist jedoch ebenfalls gerechtfertigt:

Westeuropa ist hinsichtlich seines Einflusses auf die Ukraine ziemlich außen vor (war zu erwarten; ""Fuck the EU""), muss aber aufgrund Sanktionspolitik, ausbleibenden South-Stream-Deals sowie Unterstützungszahlungen gegen die ukr. Staatspleite finanziell für seine politischen Versäumnisse der Vergangenheit büßen. Die Interessen einiger internationaler Unternehmen (vertreten durch die USA bzw. umgekehrt) werden gewahrt. Das ukrainische Volk wird nach wie vor von korrupten Oligarchen beherrscht, die Verschlechterung der wirtschaftlichen Situation und die Entfremdung vom Brudervolk der Russen wird durch [Aufflammen des Nationalismus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8YqjAcaLYc&amp;html5=1) kompensiert. 

Was gibt es denn sonst angeblich an inhaltlicher Auseinandersetzung? Es wird der ""Einsatz von Streubomben"" erwähnt sowie, dass die ""Die Regierungsbeteiligung der Nazis so oft wiederholt wird, dass man schon einen im Gesicht sitzen hat"". Aber es wird gar nicht darauf eingegangen, ob dies zutreffend sei, kritikwürdig oder irgendwas sonst. Es wird einfach nur mittels betont leidenschaftlicher Rhetorik als blödsinnig zurückgewiesen. 

Dass es heute jungen Lesern gar nicht mehr auffällt, ob wirklich eine inhaltliche Auseinandersetzung in einem Text stattfindet, oder ob stattdessen nur ihre politische Sichtweise mit glühender Sprache bestätigt wird, ist ebenso lehrreich wie erschütternd.

*""Nous sommes deux nations souveraines et indépendantes qui prenons nos décisions en nous fondant sur nos intérêts nationaux respectifs. Mais c'est précisément parce que nos intérêts et nos valeurs sont si proches que nous avons été en mesure de faire franchir un nouveau cap à notre alliance.""*

Afin de se positioner comme candidat crédible dans un futur proche, le FN réaffirme son soutien inconditionnel à la participation de la France, directement et indirectement, aux projets américains. Il est évident que critiquer le FN ne doit pas revenir à s'adosser sur les PS; la question de la torture est vieille en Europe et en France, et n'est pas unique à l'extrême-droite.

It's all (almost delibratly, it seems) vague, not explaining how any one sources supports any claim, all while making grave accusations left and right, and then drawing conclusions based on those unsupported claims.

So I do not feel culturally enriched to be living near a poor neighbourhood where they barely speak my language (or any European language), they believe boys and girls should study separated, and girls don't need higher education, because some Prophet thought so, 1400 years ago.

false,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; PARIS: French police launched raids across the country early Monday, dismantling a network sending jihadist fighters to Syria, a police source told AFP.
&gt; 
&gt; Elite and anti-terror police units descended on around a dozen targets, mostly in the southern region of Toulouse, but also around Paris and in the northern region of Normandy, the source said on condition of anonymity.
&gt; 
&gt; It was not immediately clear how many people were arrested.
&gt; 
&gt; In recent months France, which has Europe's largest Muslim population, has been facing the fact that hundreds of its citizens have openly joined jihadist groups in Iraq and Syria and have even called for attacks on their homeland.
&gt; 
&gt; The new reality was driven home in a video from ISIS released in mid-November, showing three Kalashnikov-wielding Frenchmen burning their passports and calling on Muslims to join them or stage attacks in France.
&gt; 
&gt; A grisly execution video released around the same time featured at least one French citizen who hailed from a small village in Normandy and converted to Islam in his teens.
&gt; 
&gt; Almost 1,000 French nationals from a wide range of backgrounds are estimated to have left to join jihadists in Iraq and Syria, including some 400 thought to be currently fighting on the ground and almost 50 who were killed.
&gt; 
&gt; According to figured published in the Le Monde newspaper in November, about a quarter of those who left to join the jihadists were converts to Islam, with many coming from everyday French backgrounds.

Leaving Iraq and Afghanistan is not the end of this - we will be back soon enough. Then we'll pull out because war is politically unpalatable, particularly in far-away regions, and the cycle will only repeat itself.

It depends if you want to talk about whether going in was a good idea or not, or whether you want to discuss if leaving was. I believe going in was a good idea on the grounds that I personally wouldn't risk a dangerous brutal dictator like Saddam Hussein, who has a history of using chemical weapons on his own people and probably should have been deposed a decade previously, getting hold of them again. However weak the evidence turns out to be of whether or not he has them on a particular day. Saddam was much more than ""something bad"".

But even if it was a bad idea, Saddam is gone. I see two alternatives to the above scenario of not leaving the region in peace: the first, probably more popular, is to just leave the region alone to descend into an extended civil war scenario and probably have more civilian casualties than in any short-term conflict with better equipped and trained ""Western"" forces, creating a sworn enemy of the West in any case, even if we leave them alone. And eventually, spend billions in fighting them anyway.

The other, is to go in and stay there, for a couple of decades at least. It's a long time, I know, but I think if we don't, we'll be there for longer intermittently. We also need to spend the money in investing and trade, education. Give them it for all I care - but realistically it would probably be in the form of loans. Make sure it's well spent. Don't keep an obvious presence on the ground, but do shut down ISIS/Taliban/whatever comes next when it appears. 

I can agree that the way the regime change itself was handled was far from ideal. The sectarian Shia-led Maliki government caused or catalyzed ISIS. It probably wouldn't have happened with Saddam still there, but I don't think that that means getting rid of him caused ISIS.",0,1418633071,null,0,1418633486,0,cmvda9m,t3_2paqbv,t1_cmvda9m,t1_cmvcnwj,null,1425425144,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Berlin is big in the sense that it is spread out over a large area and sights of interest are scattered all over the place: you could certainly spend a couple of weeks in Berlin and still not see everything. Berlin has had a fascinating history from the 12th century onwards, and each era has left its mark on the city. I highly recommend [Dorling Kindersley's Eyewitness Guides](http://www.amazon.com/Eyewitness-Travel-Guide-Berlin-Publishing/dp/0789451689) to get the most out of a big city like Berlin. As well as being packed with insider tips, history, art and architecture, they also have a comprehensive guide to everything from how to recognise a police officer to how to use the public transport.

Even so, a month is long enough to strike out and explore a bit. It depends on what you're interested in, but here are a few ideas that are easily within reach of Berlin:

* Potsdam (literally right next to Berlin)
* The Spreewald, around Lübben and Lübbenau; the home of the Sorbs, a Slavic ethnic minority, in an area of marshland with more canals than roads; the only place in Germany where the post is delivered by punt
* Dresden
* Leipzig
* Schwerin
* Hamburg
* Erfurt

Prague is close enough if you spend a night or two there (not Germany, of course, but definitely worth a visit if you can manage it).",0,1418634832,null,0,false,0,cmvdnj3,t3_2pb8ao,t1_cmvdnj3,t3_2pb8ao,null,1425424897,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3

It isn't just 'destination' or 'business' travel to be accounted for it is the price to consumer. Perhaps a traveler would prefer to fly in to a different airport, because it was cheaper, and then take the bus, train, or rent a car. Or perhaps a traveler decided to change their plans. 

The point is Europe is not small, but it is dense; so you can expect a highly susceptibility to variability. 


Why not specify hub locations with 'mega-airports' for international travel, in conjunction with fewer smaller airports to service interstate commerce and travel.

If only is were strictly an individual matter... but freeer trade between two countries means a convergence of prices, including the price of labor. So free trade with a lower wage country will mean a drop in wages.

&gt;•Even though it is beneficial for the economy as a whole, it may increase inequality.
 •Developing countries may need ""incubation time"" for important industries with high added value (e.g. automobiles). Notice that there are almost no big, global corporations in Eastern Europe (that are not owned by foreigners). I think that the only way such corporations can emerge is either protectionism (many examples of that in China – Baidu, Huawei) or gradual growth of a small company that targets some small market at first – but foreign companies often buy these to get rid of a possible future competitor.

false,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Well, it's the reverse the other way round; if you went process-first then you'd have to use institutions that you haven't explained yet. If you did both at a time, the lack of structure would be confusing. There is no optimal solution because of all the interdependencies, unfortunately.

Of course you could go high-level overview first and then drill down into detail in institution or process specific follow-up episodes. 

&gt;  How I end up approaching it will likely depend on the form the first script takes, and I unfortunately won't be able to begin work on that for another week or so.

A week's nothing relative to the work load you're taking on here.

While I'm at it, sitting here and spending minutes to type sentences to suggest how you should spend many, *many* hours of your time, here's a quick ad-hoc outline of how I would approach something like that ~~if I would be insane enough to take on a project like this~~.

The very first thing I'd research would be if there was some budget I could get my hands on. Not to get payed for what is more work than you probably realise yet, but it's possible that MEPs have a pot they can use to invite e.g., groups of students to Brussels. I know the German Bundestag has something like that for visiting groups.

Then I might whip up something like a Gantt-esque knowledge-dependency diagram to get a grasp on what viewers need to know before they can understand the next concept. This wouldn't only help with finding a structure but might even prevent a situation where you end up having written several scripts (or worse, made the terrible mistake of prematurely producing episodes) only to then notice a severe flaw in your approach.  
It will also help to not get lost into details that won't be important later on, it will tell you when to say ""we'll learn more about this in a later episode"" or when to recap something from a previous one.

Next I'd write the rough scripts for all episodes before I'd even think of recording anything. This will be a video, so you'll need to show something. There will be organisational charts. When you know which ones you'll need, you can look for a collaborator who knows something about graphics design; if you try to do that without being able to tell what will be needed they'd hesitate to commit to an unspecified work load.

Once all that is in place and I could be reasonably sure the approach will work, and only then, I'd refine the scripts, make sure I got all the stock imagery in place, record all sound and video, and finally compose and cut.

The very first episode would probably be about why all those institutions are needed in the first place. They're not a purpose in themselves and there's no point in understanding the ""how"" without the ""why"".  
This would be a bit about the EU's history, and a lot about the Single Market. This is what most of the EU's institutions are concerned with most of the time, and what the bulk of legislation addresses. It doesn't only bring economic advantages, but lets us have a level of consumer rights that would result in corporations simply ignoring markets if countries would enact them on their own (think of the recycling directive or the ban on animal testing for cosmetic products), and prevents a race-to-the-bottom scenario in areas such as workers' rights or environmental regulation. Essentially, members form a policy cartel.  
What I keep seeing around here is that commenters don't understand the difference between the Single Market and a free trade area. This is essential and can be explained at the example of the CE mark. The common regulations and EU directives *make* the Single Market. And when you want to have a common set of rules, you need a mechanism to agree on and enforce them. That's what's at the very core of the EU's institutions, conveniences for citizens are a bonus, and attempts to expand on this by channelling the political power that comes with being the world's largest common economic area into a united (or at least coordinated)  foreign policy are relatively recent additions.

*The ticket checker came across as sketchy when asking for money, etc. I would have been skeeved out, too, and called the BVG right away to check on policy.

*BVG responded in German, which seems a bit odd, given that pretty much all of its documents are available in multiple languages.  At the very least, if they had to send it out in German, someone could have been courteous enough to write a short disclaimer at the top in English saying, ""hey, I have to send this to you in German, but make sure you respond.""  Even then, the OP could not provide the information requested because in his account, the ticket taker took the ticket from him.  BVG is coming across as increasingly sketchy there.

*As far as we know, there was no real ""Mahnung"" phase; everything skipped right to ""Inkasso.""  As far as I know (again, not a lawyer), all Mahnungen must be sent via some format where there is a hard copy at the end, and as far as we know, this was never done.

Il est facile de se proclamer contre les guerres ""sauf contre le Mali"". Le faire sincèrement est une autre pair de manche. Si le FN était réellement contre ces opérations, alors pourquoi Marine Lepen a appelé a un réarmement de l'armée française à l'occasion du 11 Novembre?

I was planning to do the same, but then I realized that kids after me may actually be getting better education, since a few years ago middle school used to be a joke and now they take some more serious tests (however I don't believe this is the way to go).

As for higher education I believe we face identical problems. Literally everybody's going for a degree now, which means that some of those degrees become completely worthless. Best students usually end up on best universities so the other universities have to adjust what they demand from their students. They have the incentive to do so though, because I believe they get they money for every student. And this is were it becomes ridiculous. I live in Lublin, city of about 400 000, 100 000 of which are students. We produce about 600 lawyers, 350 building engineers, 200+ environmental engineers (some of them will do the exact same thing building ones can do) every year. There's simply no way that they are all getting a job. And there's simply no way that they're all good specialists. Imagine my surprise, when I realized that MIT has roughly the same number of students as my *Politechnika*.

That's why I wrote ""relatively well-educated"". There's a will to learn, but the education alone doesn't mean anything anymore. I believe we should introduce some kind of limit on the number of graduates in the most important branches of education and adjust them to reality.

Si vis pacem para bellum.

&gt;Elle a appelé en particulier à un arrêt immédiat des réductions budgétaires pour l'armée, et à une augmentation systématique du budget militaire. Que faire avec tout cet argent? Rester dans son treilli tranquille au régiment?

À quoi sert l'armée selon toi ?

La France a des territoires sur toute la planète, elle aspire à être indépendante des autres pays. Ne pas avoir d'armée c'est se soumettre aux autres. D'ailleurs ce sont les Présidents les plus atlantistes que sont Sarko et Hollande qui ont baissé le budget de l'armée.

Forcément, entretenir une force militaire capable de nous défendre en Europe, dans l'Océan Indien, dans les Caraïbes, en Amérique du Sud, dans le Pacifique et au milieu de l'Atlantique, ça a un coût.

__Giancarlo Magalli__, detto ""il Grande"" (Lilliput, 23 agosto 1947) è un conduttore televisivo. La sua assunzione alla RAI è convenuta a tutta l'azienda, perché viste le sue ridotte dimensioni i dirigenti RAI gli pagano metà dello stipendio.
Attualmente è impegnato alla stesura della sua autobiografia dal titolo *Perché sugli autobus salgo ancora gratis*; per concentrarsi al massimo su questa sua nuova esperienza si è ritirato nelle tenute di Albano Carrisi.

But when you look at the bigger picture - for example if you check out the documentary film ""Taxi to the Dark Side"" you start getting s sense that ""enemy combatants"" are captured and detained around the world to justify budgets for the CIA and various branches of the military - sure there are a few ops here and there like the mission to kill Bin Laden - but the film estimates towards the end that only 1% of the people captured have proven ties to terror... So it feels like the same shit cops pull in plenty of countries - issuing x number of fines and arresting x number of people just to keep or raise their budgets and get a commendation from mgmt for their hard work

Paraphrasing one the convicted American MPs in the film ""you see guys being tagged as high value and being sent to Guantanamo and that keeps the pressure on for the next group of guys you pick up - you want the results to be just as good or better each time you detain guys - so that your higher ups are happy with your work - this is why people go so far in their interrogations even when there's clearly no information"" 

A great example is the guy who was detained and tortured until he told US staff that Saddam had chemical weapons - which was used as grounds for the war and later turned out to be false and him just saying what his captors wanted to hear

&gt;Si vis pacem para bellum.

Difficile de distinguer cette rhétorique des justifications génériques qu'on utilise pour préparer la guerre (et non la paix)

&gt;
À quoi sert l'armée selon toi ?
La France a des territoires sur toute la planète, elle aspire à être indépendante des autres pays. Ne pas avoir d'armée c'est se soumettre aux autres. D'ailleurs ce sont les Présidents les plus atlantistes que sont Sarko et Hollande qui ont baissé le budget de l'armée.
Forcément, entretenir une force militaire capable de nous défendre en Europe, dans l'Océan Indien, dans les Caraïbes, en Amérique du Sud, dans le Pacifique et au milieu de l'Atlantique, ça a un coût.

Ce n'est pas juste avoir une armée, mais avoir une armée avec un budget bien plus élevé. Que je sache, les territoires outre-mers français ne sont pas plus menacés qu'habituellement. 

Sur la question plus large, une armée sert à défendre un état. C'est d'autant plus vrai pour une garde nationale tournée vers un adversaire intérieur.

*""On l'a vu en Libye, on l'a vu en Syrie : nous sommes en attente le doigt sur la couture du pantalon de ce que Barack Obama va nous dire de faire ou ne pas faire"".* Le Pen préconise une politique militaire *""indépendante, et liée à une diplomatie indépendante, indépendante de l'UE et de l'Otan.""* Ainsi, Lepen voudrait distancer la France des USA, mais seulement pour conduire sa propre politique impérialiste.

&gt;Les mouvements sociaux se multiplient ? On a des données chiffrées là-dessus ? Tu parles de la manif pour tous ?
Ce que je vois surtout se multiplier, c'est une apathie et un individualisme.

Quel intérêt pour une garde nationale si ce n'est pour défendre l'intérieur ? Et oui, il me semble qu'il y a tout petit peu plus de tensions sociales qu'auparavant. On a juste le gouvernement le plus impopulaire de la cinquième république. L'hostilité du FN aux grèves est t'elle à prouver ?

EDIT: une partie du comment est passé à la trappe:

&gt;2 milliards d'euros, c'est le coût de 2 mois d'immigration selon l'OCDE.

L'intérêt n'étant pas de comparer l'incomparable, mais de se demander d'où vient l'argent. 2 Milliards d'euros pour les forces armées, ça vient probablement de coupes dans les budgets sociaux.",0,1418638170,null,0,1418638944,0,cmveabp,t3_2pcb8v,t1_cmveabp,t1_cmve4j7,null,1425424538,0,false,france,t5_2qhjz,0

I was in a similar situation to you in that I graduated at 18, took a gap year and now study in England (hey, I even have a single mother!)

Firstly about the gap year. The worst thing you could possibly do is go into a gap year without any sense of plan. I think gap years are a great thing and can teach you a lot about yourself that you may not learn so quickly elsewhere. Working in a commercial kitchen for the first time, I learnt a lot about working under pressure, appreciating quality and well, culinary stuff. Living in hostels and travelling, you learn a lot about social skills and different perspectives. Could I have learnt these things elsewhere? Sure, but who knows when. And if you can afford to do it now, I see no problem with that.

Come to my second point, also regarding your gap year. I would split it up so you spend some time working and saving up money, so you don't have to worry about these things when you want to travel. 

Thirdly, why specifically England? What are you looking to study and where? Having graduated in Germany, I wanted to leave the country at all costs - now, I think I would've been perfectly happy with going to the Netherlands instead of racking up a huge bill in the UK.

&gt;Ce n'est pas juste avoir une armée, mais avoir une armée avec un budget bien plus élevé. Que je sache, les territoires outre-mers français ne sont pas plus menacés qu'habituellement

Ils ne le sont pas moins qu'il y a 10 ans. Du coup pourquoi le budget devrait baisser ?

https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forces_arm%C3%A9es_fran%C3%A7aises#Budget

*Les budgets de 2006 et 2007 sont de 47,7 milliards d'euros, soit le deuxième budget avec le Royaume-Uni. La France consacre alors environ 2,4 % par an de son PIB à sa défense. En 2012, le budget est de 31 milliards et demi d’euros, soit 1,5 % du PIB*.

https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forces_arm%C3%A9es_fran%C3%A7aises#Budget
Les budgets de 2006 et 2007 sont de 47,7 milliards d'euros, soit le deuxième budget avec le Royaume-Uni. La France consacre alors environ 2,4 % par an de son PIB à sa défense. En 2012, le budget est de 31 milliards et demi d’euros, soit 1,5 % du PIB.
On propose de le refaire passer à 2%

La question de la baisse du budget, en plus d'être une question d'alignement (puisqu'on baisse les budgets en Europe depuis la fin de la Guerre Froide), c'est une question de tactique budgétaire. Certains, comme Lepen, préfèrent exclure la ""défense nationale"" des coupes austéritaires, et cela va avec une tactique d'alignement plus indépendante.

Le PS en général, préfère inclure les budgets militaires dans les coupes, quitte à plus s'intégrer au sein des alliés de la France.

En d'autre termes, ce sont deux tactiques qui auront de toute manière la participation aux guerres impérialistes comme conséquences. La différence se trouve dans les modalités d'intervention.

&gt;Il y a des ennemis de l'intérieur. On a d'ailleurs 1100 Français impliqués dans le djihad. On parle de 12 000 salafistes en France.

Et ce seront bien entendu les seules cibles affectées à cette Garde Nationale.

&gt;Le fait que le gouvernement soit impopulaire ne change pas grand chose. On a peut-être même moins de manifs qu'avant. Les émeutes sont aussi fréquentes qu'avant voire moins.

Le risque en revanche est plus grand, au fur et à mesure que les inégalités se creusent et que moins de programme sociaux les colmatent.

Other involved countries -- say Poland -- are implicated but are not specifically named and neither specifically asked to be omitted. 

Further, Great Britain and the United States work *very closely*, and have for a very long time. The SAS and DEVGURU (Seal Team 6) conduct operations in mixed squads -- which is rather bizarre. The NSA provided funding for the GCHQ and the two are rather interchangeable. And the CIA and MI6 have been working together -- operationally -- since World War 2. Oh and who can forget the 1953 Iranian Revolution where the MI6 and CIA overthrew a government together?

And lets not forget Great Britain's decision to field two *Queen Elizabeth-class* super carriers  was equal parts air-wing ability and America.

Agreed, but I also have an irresistible urge to play devil's advocate here.

When it comes to problems created by muslim immigration, the response is usually to assert that the problem is with integration into society, with immigration policies, with racism preventing employment, and that violence and anti-social behaviour is also a problem with Europeans as well. And many of those may be valid arguments. But the problem I have with all this is that *they came here*. Why are we responsible for their integration? Why are we responsible for being sensitive towards their sky-wizard?

I'm sure that the vast majority of muslims just want to live normal lives, but that doesn't remove the fact that some do not.

However, immigration should be justified firstly on more fundamental grounds. The following is an extract from [an article](http://thoughtsoptimisticrealist.wordpress.com/2014/03/29/migration-is-a-social-imperative/) I penned in March.

&gt;... the philosophical and ethical basis for migration is hugely powerful. Although the members of humanity are born into different societies and cultures, we are all fundamentally human and inhabitants of the same planet. Thus, it is difficult to justify from an ethical perspective strict border controls which curtail immigration and prevent people from migrating to other parts of the world to build a better life for themselves, their families, and ultimately the global citizenry.

[An analysis](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/the-mainstream-press-has-lost-its-balance-on-immigration/) of United Kingdom newspaper articles between 2006 and 2013 recently found a deterioration in the quality of public discourse concerning immigration over the period analysed. It would appear that many political actors have abandoned more fundamental justifications for immigration, such as the one extracted from my article previously, and instead have focused almost entirely upon the economic advantages of immigration. There are also other benefits from immigration, such as the cultural dividend it affords to society.

Had many political actors combined economic advantages of immigration with ethical justifications and cultural benefits, public discourse over immigration would likely be more balanced, and anti-immigration populism less successful. Such populism would doubtless still exist, as we have very recently suffered a global financial crisis, and indeed continue to suffer its aftershocks, however its successes may have been more constrained. It is dispiriting that many political actors continue to rely almost entirely upon an economic justification for immigration. This needs to change. More fundamental justifications for immigration must be employed.",0,1418640051,null,0,false,0,cmvemsf,t3_2pc0am,t1_cmvemsf,t1_cmvd271,null,1425424315,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt; If Bush had not signed the ""The Hague invasion act"". Stating that the US has carté blanche to invade the Netherlands should an American citizen be charged at the international criminal court.

As the UN secretariat on Human Rights and Torture said these crimes were committed in countries who are signatories of the ICC. At worst the US would apply pressure to get the person released -- putting further pressure on America, potentially igniting a firestorm. To be sure it is a delicate situation; but a delicate situation where we must -- as human beings -- stand up not only for the values of the 'west' but for basic human rights.

&gt;That's about the politics that involves this program, and it's disgusting.

I don't think anyone is trying to blame anyone other than the United States -- and rightfully so. America has bases in Europe, and has since World War 2, for strategic reasons. In my view there is good reason for these bases: from the obvious strategic implications to economic benefits for the states. In fact I go further and invite Germany and Great Britain to position bases on U.S. soil. Primarily for the strategic, training, and logistic value. These countries will rise and fall together; lets have no illusions on that fact. The American people also didn't commit a war crime, as they did, per Article 3 of the four Geneva treaties. 

But of course: The country at 'fault' is America -- more specifically Bush, Cheney, CIA officials, and the DOJ.

**Buying a used bike in Germany that is suitable for the trip:**

Since you want to register it here in Germany it needs TÜV, easiest way to get that is buying a bike that is still is registered. You don't have to prove its roadworthiness when you buy it as long as you get the last TÜV report from the previous owner. To check that every German licence plate has sticker like [this](http://upundaway.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/tuev-sued-pruefplakette-2015.jpg). The number in the middle is the year when the next inspection is due and the number facing up the month it is due. -&gt; Saves you ~90€ and the hassle of getting new TÜV

Important: You need the actual form that says ""Hauptuntersuchung §29 StVZO"" on it for your registration, so make sure you get all the paperwork from the previous owner. Also make sure that you get both parts of the ""Zulassungsbescheinigung""... If the owner does not have them the bike is stolen!

**Getting insurance and registering the bike:**

Things you need: 

* Valid German address for paperwork
* Bank account that allows IBAN transaction to pay taxes and insurance
* [""Zulassungsbescheinigung Teil I + Teil II""](https://media.essen.de/media/wwwessende/bilder/aemter/ordner_33/zulassungs_und_fahrerlaubnisbehoerde/ZB_II_62515.jpg)
* [""Prüfbericht zur Hauptuntersuchung §29StVZO""](http://www.x-fish.org/blog_picture/111010_04.jpg)
* Girocard debit card or cash for registration fees and new licence plates
* Valid EVB-number from your insurance company

So what is an EVB? Once you know the model of the bike you want to insure you can contact any insurance company that offers liability insurance like ADAC Autoversicherungen. Once you sign the contract they will give you an EVB-Number for registration.

**What to do with the bike ofter the trip:**

It sounds like you are planning a one way trip, so I suppose it would be easiest for you to get no export registration, get the bike ""stolen"" in Mongolia by someone who does not need/want paperwork and register it as such when you are back (I mean you totally planned on bringing it back to Germany but you had some bad luck).

Otherwise you need to bring all the paperwork with you and get an export registration.... I actually don't know",0,1418641131,null,0,1418641679,0,cmvetuu,t3_2pbscf,t1_cmvetuu,t3_2pbscf,null,1425424159,10,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,10

So we take in refugees, because we have pledged to help people in distress.

We mainly take in immigrants because we need labour.

Logically we can expect more from a immigrant than a refugee as they are more likely to find jobs and integrate.

&gt;__Kinder Surprise__, also known as a __Kinder Egg__ or __Kinder Joy__ or, in the original Italian, __Kinder Sorpresa__, is a [candy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy) manufactured by Italian company [Ferrero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrero_SpA). Originally intended for [children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child), it has the form of a [chocolate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate) egg containing a small [toy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy), often requiring assembly.

&gt;""Kinder"" is the German word for ""children"".

1. Terroristen hassen den Westen nicht wegen seiner Freiheit, es ist schlicht nicht deren Ziel die Freiheit des Westens zu zerstören. Sie hassen den Westen und insbesondere die USA, weil diese sich permanent in die Angelegenheiten ihrer Staaten einmischen, Diktatoren stützen, Demokratien stürzen, mit Drohnen morden, Länder besetzen, die Liste ist beliebig fortsetzbar. Keiner von denen wird Terrorist in der Absicht über die Freiheit zu siegen oder uns hier von unseren Regierungen unterdrücken zu lassen.

2. Bezogen auf die angewandten Methoden, sprich das Freiheit, Recht und Gesetz gebrochen werden und der Westen sein wahres Gesicht zeigt, ist dies auch kein Sieg, denn es würde voraussetzen, dass dieser Verrat an den sog. Grundwerten des Westens erstmalig und aufgrund des mohammedanischen Terrors geschehen ist. Auch das ist natürlich falsch. Nicht erst seit der [Operation Phoenix](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Phoenix) weiß man, dass die USA es mit den Grundrechten nicht so ernst nehmen. Das selbe gilt auch für die Überwachung, welche hier in Deutschland seit jeher die gesamte Bevölkerung einschloss. Die NSA horchte schon lange vor dem 11. September alles ab, die amerikanischen Besatzer schissen auf das Fernmeldegeheimnis, die durch sie eingerichteten Geheimdienste konnten ja nicht ""mit dem Grundgesetz unterm Arm rumrennen"", Terror gegen die eigenen Bevölkerung ob in Europa oder den USA, MKULTRA, Gladio und RAF der späteren Generationen, all das ist vom Westen ganz ohne die Gefahr durch mohammedanische Terroristen angestellt worden und war weitaus schlimmer, als die jetzt zu Tage getretene Folterpraxis. Nur völlig verwirrte Propagandaopfer glauben, dass es hier so etwas wie Grundrechte gibt, oder dass der Westen eine moralisch überlegene Position inne hat. Das war nie so, das wird nie so sein.

Alors ça on est bien d'accord. Après le Mali a peu de ressources, un territoire compliqué et très vaste, je suis assez sceptique sur ses perspectives d'indépendance.

&gt;Etre contre la guerre, ca n'est pas restreint, c'est tout un programme politique. Ca ne consiste pas a dire ""oh j'aime pas la guerre mais on va la faire"".

Bah oui on est d'accord. Par contre dans le cas de la Lybie et de la Syrie c'est un délire des politiques au pouvoir. Ces interventions étaient complètement inutiles et tout à fait évitables. Par contre, le FN ni moi n'avons dit qu'on était contre ""la guerre"".

&gt;Ca veut aussi dire combattre ce qui pourrait l'amener: C'est à dire les ingérences

Oui mais à quel moment combattre une ingérence d'un autre pays devient une ingérence ?

Non puoi applicare un concetto definito dall'uomo ad altri esseri viventi. Per il ghepardo non fa differenza se è una gazzella o un'antilope o uno gnu o un cane. La distinzione che il ghepardo fa non è ""È una gazzella, che è inferiore al cane quindi posso mangiarla ma il cane no"". Semplicemente distingue in quello che può mangiare, quello che non può mangiare, quello che costituisce pericolo. Chiamalo istinto, chiamalo evoluzione, non è specismo.

State cercando di dimostrare una teoria in maniera molto sbagliata, perché volete applicare ad esseri non al livello *intellettuale* dell'uomo concetti che sono propria definizione del lavoro della mente umana. Noi abbiamo bisogno di specismo e antispecismo, perché ci siamo allontanati così tanto dalla natura che ci sembra irreale essere considerati animali e quindi dobbiamo dare un ordine di importanza e usabilità agli altri esseri viventi. 

L'anti specismo non è minacciato dal corso della natura perché ne fa semplicemente parte. Mi considero antispecista (NON animalista, non amo gli altri animali come non amo l'uomo, non ho un cane perché non lo considero giusto nei suoi confronti), se posso evito di schiacciare formiche quando cammino, lumache quando piove, non uccido le zanzare quando ce le ho in camera - d'estate dormo con un flaconcino di autan o quelle minchiate lì - quando mi entra una blatta in casa la catturo e la butto fuori. Cosa succede se capita e ne pesto una inconsapevolmente? Niente. Non è colpa mia se sono migliaia di volte più grande. Se sono nella foresta e un elefante non mi vede e mi calpesta non puoi dargli la colpa. L'antispecismo non è aver paura di vivere perché altrimenti uccidi esseri viventi, è considerarsi pari a loro e quindi non potersi arrogare il diritto di decidere per la loro vita. Non mi interessa cosa sarà di loro in natura, non è un problema mio. 

Per chi ha tirato in mezzo i batteri e le medicine, vorrei ricordare che durante la malattia c'è una guerra in corso: migliaia di batteri mi stanno attaccando, e io non sono san Francesco. Se mi attacca un cane non esito a prenderlo a pugni sul muso nella stessa maniera in cui se vengo attaccato da un uomo mi difendo. L'antispecismo non è GLI ANIMALI SONO MIGLIORI DI NOI (che paradossalmente è specismo, animalisti del cazzo) ma gli animali hanno gli stessi miei diritti e io non sono nessuno per decidere della loro vita.

false,Gschaftlhuber,null,null,"Kulturkritik setzt sich natürlich immer leicht dem Vorwurf aus, dass man die Vergangenheit glorifizieren wolle. Doch wollen wir an unserem Stammtisch einmal folgendes erwägen: 

Die Digitalisierung und Vernetzung der Kommunikation haben u.a. zwei Effekte. Einerseits ist eine ganze Menge Information verfügbar, deren Einordnung aber vielen nicht gelingt, da sie durch Einübung in Kurztexte nicht mehr genügend Kognitionsvermögen aufbringen, um komplexere Sachverhalte zu erfassen. Außerdem führt das Angebot an Information zur Illusion des Wissens, die jedoch trügerisch ist, da sie die Skepsis mindert und damit die Offenheit für andere Perspektiven. 

Andererseits - und dieser Effekt ist möglicherweise folgenreich - gibt es im Menschen als sozialem Wesen den Drang angelegt, so sein zu wollen, wie die anderen, die zur jeweiligen Gruppe gehören. In frühen stammesgeschichtlichen Stadien war die Gruppe die Sippe bzw. der Stamm. Im einen trugen alle eine Tonplatte in den Lippen und huldigten den Baumgeistern, im nächsten flochten sie sich Zöpfe in die Haare und fanden die Erdgeister besser, etc. Die Homogenisierung betraf also nur kleine Gruppen, und ein paar Kilometer weiter gab es eine Alternative.

In einem späteren Stadium gab es in Griechenland den Stadtstaat, beispielsweise Athen. Was der jeweilige Stadtstaat tun wollte, entschied man in gemeinschaftlicher Abstimmung nach Abwägung der Argumente - die Geburt der Rhetorik und der Demokratie. Wichtig: auch hier gab es ein paar Kilometer weiter einen anderen Stadtstaat - sei es Sparta, Korinth oder Poteidaia - der jeweils seinen eigene Version der Weltsicht und z.T. ein unterschiedliches Herrschaftssystem hatte. 

Heute betrifft das Streben nach Angleichung im digitalen Dorf Millionen von Menschen auf einmal, die sich zudem in ihren Wünschen und Neigungen algorithmisch ausrechnen lassen. Das ist eine Weiterentwicklung des vor ca. einem Jahrhundert entstandenen Massenmenschen (Ortega y Gasset). Dessen Entstehung hatte - verbunden mit der Verfeinerung der Manipulations- und Lenkungsmechanismen in der Propaganda - im Nationalsozialismus und Kommunismus zu den größten Kriegen und Verbrechen der Menschheitsgeschichte geführt. 

Ich gebe zu, dass ich in der Darstellung aus Platzmangel ein paar geschichtliche Sprünge eingelegt habe, aber es wird vielleicht deutlich, warum ein wenig Skepsis bezüglich derjenigen, die die Welt hauptsächlich durch ihre vernetzten Rechner betrachten, angebracht ist.

thank you for your visit to Goslar and its Christmas market. I would like to express my earnest apologies for any displeasure you may have experienced during your stay. I am also sorry to hear about your disappointment with our market in the Rammelsberg mine.

But I am happy to inform you that we are in the process of fixing the problem of the bad weather you were experiencing during the stay by moving our annual Christmas market to a later date, preferably some day in mid-July.

I must also kindly object to your observation of there being ""nothing to do"" in Goslar when our main attraction features a [majestic golden eagle sitting atop a market fountain.](http://i.imgur.com/j6TNsdY.jpg) That's just the kind of exiting installation you won't find in cities like New York or London. (But please be aware that you're not allowed to touch it. It's also strictly forbidden to drink the water in that fountain. For your safety.)

As for the entrance fee to the Rammelsberg mine, I have to inform you that there's currently no way to get a refund for it. I will forward your complaint to our local Ortsverein to see if we can maybe install a rollercoaster or a ferris wheel inside that mine.

And should you ever be sick of Goslar - as if that is possible! - always remember that it's only 45 km away from the metropolitan area of Bad Salzdetfurth!

If there’s anything else I can do to improve your stay in Goslar, just let me know!

Yours faithfully,

As far as export plates go, it seems like they would be the easiest to get as a US citizen if I was 'exporting' to Mongolia, right? If not, what sort of registration would I need? If I wouldn't have to do border crossings and paperwork, I wouldn't even register it. I would just start driving to Mongolia after I purchase it. Is there a way to 'legally' own the bike without going through the Amtsschimmel.

I guess I'll just bullet point the rest of the questions I have for you. 

* If the bike comes without TUV, it will cost 90 euro to receive one?
* Is a TUV necessary to get the bike registered in my name? Even if it is an export registration?
* Will a US military base work for a valid address, or should I ask an old austauschfamilie to use theirs?
* I have an old Sparkasse account. I don't know if it is active or not, or even how to check if it is. I assume this will work for IBAN?
* What will the fees and plates tally up to?
* If I purchase from a small vendor in GaPa, will he likely help me with registration of the bike and the red-tape involved? I like to think I know the German persona, but auto dealers are a whole different game.

In 2013, it received [more than 135 000](http://www.thelocal.se/20140619/sweden-takes-19-percent-of-eus-asylum-seekers) (half of them being Syrians). Remember, Sweden's population is barely over 9 million. That means the population increases by 1.5% a year, and that's only counting refugees.

Furthermore, all Syrian refugees are being granted permanent residence by Sweden, blurring the line between immigration and asylum. That is not a good thing, as refugees are meant to go back to their country once it eventually stabilises. Doing otherwise means your immigration policy, whatever its goal was, is being bypassed as refugees turn into immigrants. I think that was Sweden is doing is unhealthy: they are going over their limits trying to accomodate so many migrants, many of whom will end up as what can only be called a ghetto. That situation only serves to grow the ranks of SD, and I would not like to see them get into power.

false,ACatInAMicrowave,advanced-english,advanced (native English),"So you've discovered the hell that is German grammar. 

In German, with a subordinate clause (a part of a sentence which can't stand on it's own, e.g. 'Because I'm tired', 'When I was a child ') the 'main' verb goes to the end of the clause. Here's some examples in English and their German equivalents. 

&gt;E: I'm going to bed because I'm tired. 

&gt;G: Ich gehe ins Bett, weil ich müde bin. 

As you can see, the verb 'bin' has gone to the end. The last part of the sentence after the comma couldn't ever be on it's own as it makes no sense. Therefore it's 'subordinate'. 

&gt;E: When I was in Germany, I got to know a lot of friends. 

&gt;G: Als ich in Deutschland war, habe ich viele Freunde kennengelernt. 

This time the subordinate clause comes first. Notice also that after the comma, the verb comes first. This is because the main cause treats the subordinate the same as it would, say, a preposition, time etc. 


&gt;E: Before we go to the cinema we have to buy the sweets, as everything is expensive there. 

&gt;D: Bevor wir ins Kino gehen, müssen wir die Süßigkeiten kaufen, da alles dort so teuer ist. 

Here we have three clauses, two of them subordinate. 

German is not my mother tongue so it's probable I've made some lexical mistakes. I hope you find this helpful anyway. It takes a while to get to grips with this rule but it will become natural soon enough if you keep at it

1) Living on a campus is overrated (or better said, its not worth 9 grand a year in tuition fees on top of 4.5 grand of accommodation fees). Yes, a lot of my friends are the people I live with and yes, this is my second year living on campus, but its not the college dorm experience that many people make it out to be (or at least I did). Maybe its the university I go to, but my block isn't one big happy family. And even if it were, it still wouldn't be worth 13k a year.

2) To add on to point 1: you can make that kind of experience for yourself. I know a lot of people who decided to study in the Rotterdam, Maastricht, Riga or Barcelona, who didn't stay in dorms, but rather found an apartment and they still managed to emulate something that seems very similar to what my experience is, that is: cooking with friends, having flat parties, just hanging out, etc. Again: yes, it is easier when you live in dorms, but no, it just isn't worth it for me.

3) I don't know much about Computer Sciences or Software Engineering, but I think Scotland could potentially be a good balance between the lifestyle and the costs. Sorry that I can't help more on that front.

4) My last point is a strongly personal opinion, though I've discussed it both with British people and with foreigners. I think there is something seriously fucked up with British culture, especially with respects to their drinking culture. This will only be magnified times ten at uni. Don't get me wrong, I love drinking and I'm definitely not one of those people who look down upon those who drink, but the extent to which the British students can take it is both shocking and weirdly admirable, in a morbid way. Again, maybe its the university I go to (Aston Uni), but I would've expected a culture that is more based around learning and less about chugging Strongbow mixed with piss and chunder out of a pigs head.

I do however think that your heart is in the right place. I see a lot of my own past perceptions in your writing, so I think I understand why you want to leave Germany and come to the UK.

By assimilation, you are right. I believe that assimilation creates ethnic homogeneity and ethnic homogeneity creates a strong nation-state. Japan, one of the strongest and most homogeneous nations in the world, formed by fully assimilating the Ainu and Okinawan minorities, who historically were very different from the Honshu Japanese. One of the greatest successes of the US is its full assimilation of European peoples, although regrettably on the backs of black and Hispanic minorities who were not allowed to assimilate. In the US, a Portuguese, a Swede, and a Ukrainian all see themselves as part of the same whole (""white"" Americans), while in Romania (your flair) it is hard enough to get Szekelys to identify as Romanian and speak Romanian rather than broken Magyar.

You legally own it as soon as you got the papers, to legally drive the bike it has to be registered though

&gt; If the bike comes without TUV, it will cost 90 euro to receive one?

TÜV (HU+AU) for motorcycles is 61 Euro at [TÜV-Süd](http://www.tuev-sued.de/home_de)

&gt; Is a TUV necessary to get the bike registered in my name? Even if it is an export registration?

Yes.

Elle a raison quand elle dit qu'on ne peut pas simplement lui donner des grandes consignes ou principes et que ça va avoir des résultats tout seul, ceux-ci doivent être explicitement décrits à un moment où à un autre.

Moi ces discussions me fait penser à la crise européenne actuelle. On essaye d'avoir une sorte d'IA qui va tout réguler à partir de quelques principes simplistes, en premier lieu ne pas avoir de dette. Si certains en ont plus qu'un certain montant, ils doivent tout faire pour la réduire, en priorité sur tout le reste, et c'est ça qui est considéré comme ""bien"" ou ""correct"". C'est l'algorithme de l'EU. Mais la question de qui a décidé ça ou est-ce que c'est réllement correct et efficace n'est pas posée. L'IA c'est pareil, on parle en permanence de ce que ça va faire, ça peut faire, ce qui va arriver, etc... Mais la réelle question c'est comment les principes que l'on veut appliquer le sont et quels sont-ils. Ca c'est entièrement débatable et contrôlable, mais on dirait qu'on en parle jamais. 

Un exemple concret : l'histoire des lois d'Asimov. Qu'est-ce qu'il faudrait pour qu'ils soient REELLEMENT appliqués ? Il faudrait une ultra-centralisation de la construction de toutes les parties robotiques et électroniques pouvant potientellement servir à la création de machines pour lesquelles la possibilité de l'application de ces lois se poseraient, càd celles qui pourraient blesser ou tuer. TOUTES les machines ou parties de machines en ayant la capacité devraient, en plus de leurs possibilités propres quelles qu'elles soient, avoir une IA ultra-avancée capable de décider si ce qu'on leur ordonne est interdit ou non par ces lois. Et évidemment ça dépendrait de l'information qui leur est donnée, comme pour les humains. Sans cette centralisation, n'importe qui pourrait construire des machines échappant à ces règlementations. 

Et comme quasiment n'importe quelle machine pourrait risquer de blesser, où trace-t-on la ligne entre machine ""importante"", devant se soumettre à ces lois, et les autres ? Et comment est décidé ce qui va entrer dans le champ de ces lois ou non ? Une peine de prison cause du tort à un être humain, mais on considère qu'elle est justifiée : une IA pourait-elle décider d'une peine de prison ? Qu'en est-il des ""réformes"" imposées à la Grèce, considére-t-on qu'elles causent du tort ou non, qu'elles sont justifiées ou non ? Aujourd'hui la réponse institutionelle est ""oui"" à la seconde question, mais ce n'est pas l'avis de tout le monde. Si on peut même pas se mettre d'accord sur des principes dont, en théorie ET en pratique, il serait possible de discuter entre nous, comment va-t-on se mettre d'accord sur des principes qui seront ensuite appliqués de manière automatique, systématique et aveugle, par des machines ? Qui va réussir à imposer son point de vue sur la constitution de ces algorithmes, dans quelles réunions top-secrètes, avec quelle transparence réelle ? Est-ce que ça sera comme le TAFTA ?

Tout ce que j'entend en permanence sur ce sujet, c'est des déclarations spectaculaires sur le futur ou des trucs complètement abstraits de ce genre, et le discours de ce monsieur ""transhumaniste"" (et ce mouvement dans son ensemble en est un bon exemple aussi), mais jamais de question cocnrètes comme ça.

Sadly, at the moment there are not enough capable officers left to stage a coup - the former probably being the **measure of last resort** in this situation.

The EU should break most diplomatic ties with Turkey to send a clear signal for once; hopefully it will result in some kind of public response in Turkey. But for me it is evident that only the Turkish armed forces can at this point end Erdogan his rule before things get even much, much worse. As of present Turkey is a failed democracy, which makes provisional military rule preferable to the current situation.

Zum Teil steckt da auch das [NIMBY-Phänomen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY) hinter. Angeblich haben sie ja nichts gegen Flüchtlinge, aber doch nicht nebenan!

- Wehrpflicht: 9 monate mit mäßigem Gehalt. (ca. 500 im Monat)
- danach optional: freiwillig verlängerter wehrdienst, max. 14 monate also insgesamt fast 2 jahre, oder eben kürzer. bezahlung ähnlich wie zeitsoldat (ca 1000-1500 netto, habs nimmer genau im kopf und müsste die alten gehaltszettel rauskramen)
- alternativ: 2 oder mehr jahre als zeitsoldat. von vorn herein das ""hohe"" gehalt (wird steuerlich anders abgerechnet, aber netto kommt das gleiche raus).

zu bedenken ist, je länger man dabei ist, umso höher die wahrscheinlichkeit auf nen auslandseinsatz (dafür gibts dann aber auch ne gefahrenzulage).

alles in allem könnte man sich so die ersten paar semester des studiums gut finanzieren (wenn man sparsam ist und neben dem studium arbeitet evtl. auch das ganze) und du kommst auch von daheim weg uns siehst mal was anderes. außerdem kannst evtl. da dann deinen Führerschein machen, was auch nochmal 1-2 tausender spart.

Chiudi gli occhi ed immagina una sfilza di donne munte senza che nessuno le chiedesse il permesso e poi dimmi se quest'idea non è malata anche se l'intera operazione durasse solo cinque minuti. E poi le infilano un cosa? siringone? dentro la vagina e spruzzano il seme di un bel maschione forte dai geni promettenti. 


Le secrezioni sono spontanee e possono essere anche stimolate, alcuni afidi possono anche trattenere le secrezioni se queste non vengono raccolte. Gli afidi vengono protetti dai predatori naturali. E in tutto questo non vi è **consapevolezza**.
Riporto infatti quello che intendiamo per specismo e che tu attribuisci alle formiche, perché forse nel tuo argomentare hai perso di vista la definizione:
&gt; Lo specismo è l'attribuzione di un diverso valore e status morale agli individui a seconda della loro specie di appartenenza.

Quindi stai dicendo che le formiche hanno la percezione di loro stesse, di valori e status morali e ritengono gli afidi esseri inferiori e quindi è giusto sfruttarli? 

In ogni caso, se ti piace così tanto la trasposizione uomo-vacca/formica-afide, vorrei ricordarti che le formiche si nutrono di quelli che sono gli escrementi dell'afide, non il latte. Libero di fare lo stesso.

They were born here. The problem is that their parents were allowed in while maintaining their ""culture"". So their kids, instead of being German, end up with a ""Turkish person living in Germany"" identity (even though they probably only ever went to Turkey for vacations). They are immigrants in their own country.

Now couple this with the general dissatisfaction the average youngster feels with ""the system"". For us, the scapegoat is the structure of the political/economical system, for them it is the entire ""blasphemous"" system. So while ""natives"" would become extreme left- (or right) wing, ""aliens"" end up rejecting western civilization as a whole and becoming extremists.

false,EmanueleAina,null,null,"&gt; Il Paradosso Norvegese è quel fenomeno per cui all'aumentare dell'educazione gender-neutral e dell'educazione all'eguaglianza di genere, come in Norvegia, crescono le differenze di genere nella scelta della carriera e quindi ci sono meno donne in campo scientifico. Il contraltare sono i paesi poveri, retrogradi e sessisti dove il gap professionale è molto minore, con punte come, mi sembra, l'Uganda, dove il gap nelle professioni STEM è quasi nullo.

Non ho trovato molti dati a riguardo, se hai dei link sono ben accetti.

Per quel poco che ho cercato ho trovato solo i dati in *Exploring cross-national differences in gender gaps in education*[1], dove in effetti la Norvegia non brilla particolarmente, ma non è neppure messa così male. Dati storici potrebbero essere più interessanti, ma mi pare interessante che Svezia e Finlandia siano messe meglio, anche se non in tutti i settori STEM, in particolare Engineering (e noi in Mathematics&amp;Statistics abbiamo un incredibile 62%, surclassati solo dalla Polonia con 75%).

In ogni caso i dati sono interessanti in quanto la varianza tra le nazioni europee è evidentemente troppo altra per suffragare ipotesi biologiche: se ne deduce che le forze sociali non siano affatto trascurabili e quindi interventi mirati ad equilibrarle non siano affatto sbagliati a priori.

[1] http://prema.iacm.forth.gr/docs/ws1/papers/Van%20Langen2.pdf

&gt; Questi bias non sono piccoli. Distribuiti su una popolazione, generano una buona parte del gap. Poi sono il primo a dire che ci siano elementi culturali di discriminazione, altrimenti non sarei femminista, ma indipendentemente dalla natura del problema, io critico la soluzione, che è violenta e potenzialmente pericolosa, oltre che apparentemente inefficace.

""Buona parte del gap"" ci può stare, ma dai dati sopra direi che un'altra buona parte è dovuta a fattori sociali. Poi non so a quale soluzione violenta ti stai riferendo: le quote rosa non sono certo violente, ancor meno OPW o quel poco che il ""delinquente"" Matthew Garrett ha scritto sul suo blog.

&gt; Mi sono espresso male: genera opposizione verso le persone integrate tramite le quote. Se tu devi avere almeno il 30% di donne nel tuo staff e il 70% di queste sono assunte per fare numero, una buona parte di queste sarà meno competente e meno competitivo sul piano lavorativo.

Io questo assunto non lo condivido. Siccome ho parlato di quote rosa in ambito politico, riprendo l'esempio sottolineando che mi sento sinceramente di affermare che i membri femminili inseriti non sono affatto di qualità inferiore ai membri maschili rimpiazzati. Si può discutere se esse siano migliori, ma peggiori decisamente no.

Pertanto non vedo come invece in altri settori si debba per forza ""rimpiazzare"" un uomo bravo con una donna bravina: si sceglie una donna brava e il gioco è fatto.

&gt; Se non ci fosse differenza di competenze, non ci sarebbe neanche il gap (come non c'è infatti in molti settori). Dove c'è il gap, c'è una differenza di competenze.

No, c'è una differenza di quantità, non di competenze. Qui non credo ci siano studi (ma se li hai, link!) in quanto misurare tali differenze credo sia estremamente complicato, pertanto si assume l'ipotesi nulla.

&gt; Le SJW, per definizione, rifiutano il concetto di merito, che non è legato all'individuo ma alle etichette che si porta dietro: sei nero, donna e queer?
&gt; Devi essere compensato per esser nato così e quindi eccoti un posto di lavoro, anche se sei un incompetente.

Non so se esista una definizione ufficiale, ma almeno Wikipedia riporta che Gandhi e MLK siano entrambi stati indicati come SJW, quindi 1) sbagli a usare il termine con genere femminile e 2) non credo sia corretto dire che per definizione rifiutino il merito. A tal proposito, sono assolutamente certo che Matthew (che riprendo in quanto mio più recente esempio di persona etichettata SJW) non lo rifiuta in alcun modo, ma anzi lavora affinché solo il merito e poco altro determini il valore di una persona.

&gt; E cosa succede? Succede che nel tuo posto di lavoro sarai visto come un privilegiato incompetente, e quindi odiato. E questo odio c'è sempre il rischio che una parte dei tuoi colleghi lo proietti sulle categorie a cui appartieni, che verranno viste come privilegiate. Ed ecco che se applicato su larga scala, ottieni esattamente l'effetto contrario a quello voluto.

Sì, è un osservazione interessante, limitata però a come le quote rosa vengano applicate. Come tutte le cose possono essere applicate bene o male, non c'è dubbio, ma questo non le rende sbagliate per sé.

&gt; Un esempio è l'URSS: in URSS c'erano forti politiche di inclusione di genere e razziale forzate sin da subito dal regime. Ovviamente da questa erano esclusi omosessuali, credenti e tutta un'altra serie di categorie, non era certo la stessa cosa che in Svezia. Tuttavia c'erano e c'era l'idea di un egualitarismo di fondo imposto dal loro sistema sociale. Non era parte degli individui, era parte della società, del sistema. Risultato? Appena caduto il regime è tornata in auge l'intolleranza che è stata repressa per tanti anni, che sta venendo cavalcata dalla classe politica russa e dalla chiesa ortodossa con grande successo.

Come tu riporti dalle garanzie forzate dal regime erano esclusi gli omossessuali i quali sono però il principale obiettivo dell'intolleranza attuale, il che mi fa pensare che le tue conclusioni debbano venire riconsiderate. *Forse* se ci fossero state le ""quote gay"" ora anche gli omossessuali non verrebbero visti come corpo estraneo alla società ma parte integrante di essa (ma siamo nell'iperuranio delle ipotesi).

&gt; Siamo arrivati a parlare di quote rosa perché il 70% delle soluzioni proposte dalle SJW si riduce ad una qualche forma di quota basata su genere, razza, orientamento ecc ecc.

Boh, non conosco il 100% dei SJW quindi non so stabilire in quale quantità le soluzioni proposte nella loro totalità siano assimilabili a quote rosa.

Per stare sul concreto, ritieni che OPW sia assimilabile a una forma di quote rosa?

Quali alternative ritieni più valide?

So the infrastructure used for your connection now is different than before. It might be an issue with the cables in your house, the routing, the outlet in your flat etc. So I would do some troubleshooting, like restarting the router, checking the cables (you switched some of them, right? Are they correctly plugged in? Pull them out and plug them in again), if possible try other cables. Look at your cable outlet and try to judge if it is very old and corroded etc. 

Is your internet slow all the time or only in the evening? Cable is a shared medium, so if others inthe house use it more, your connection becomes slower. If it gets to slow, they might have to upgrade the hardware you connect to. Try to do some speedchecks in regular intervals and save screenshots to prove your minimum connection speed. 

In the end, you migh need a technician to fix this issue. Of course you can call them, but if you have a shop near you, you can also go there and tell them about your problems. 

A few hints in dealing with them: Insists that you already restarted your router a few times, checked all your cables by pulling them out and plugging them in again, restarted your PC etc. Have the length of your TV cable handy, because they may suggest it's too long. They may suggest other cable issues, like a broken cable etc. Insists that you checked and switched everything already for testing and that you need a technician. You can present your speedcheck screenshots as evidence of the issue if they don't want to escalate.

The claim has not been contested yet, but it is expected that Canada and Russia will make some claims as well and these will overlap with the Danish one. The claims will be examined by a UN-commission and in 10-15 years it will be decided who gets what.

Not entirely sure if it's a good idea going on such a trip on motorcycle without a valid licence plate, hence my proposal to just register the motorcycle in your name, either a regular registration or an export registration (the process in 95% the same)

If you are fixed on exporting make sure you get an ""Ausfuhrkennzeichen"" (Export licence plate). Unfortunately I can't get you much practical information about export regulations to mongolia.

There is a nice ADAC site [here](http://www.adac.de/infotestrat/fahrzeugkauf-und-verkauf/import-export/Exportkennzeichen/default.aspx?prevPageNFB=1) that lists everthing you need for that. (Basically the same as I wrote up in my initial post, plus you have the option of getting an intl. registartion paper (10€) you will need to sell the motorcycle later. Please keep in mind that due to frequent fraud you will need to show up with the motorcycle at the registration office, so they can identify if the numbers match up. Another benefit is that if you get a licence plate that is valid for less than 3 months you won't have to pay taxes!

1. If it has no Tüv you have to get a new HU/AU inspection for 61€ (apperently the 90€ is for cars) + repair all problems they find (Motorcycle HU is a joke tbh, but passing emission tests can be tricky, usually there is a reason motorcycles are sold without TÜV)

2. You always have to register it in your name

3. The adress itself is not that important, but you should be able to recieve mail there. If /u/dinkelflakes is right and you just need a ""Meldebestätigung"", that won't be a big problem for you

4. Yep all German bank accounts work. Since you pointed out that you are from the US I just wanted you to be aware that you can't pay taxes cash, but need to have a bank account they can charge.

5. see /u/therealgeorgekaplan

6. Maye he can, just give them a call beforehand and explain them what you want to do. There is dedicated adventure touring community here in Germany and they always get exited if someone wants to do something crazy. Unless you dealer is a sports bike guy...

Another general advice: Since you wanted to get ADAC-insurance anyway make sure that before doing the whole thing head to a local ADAC place and straight up ask them what you want to do and what you have prepared. They will definately give you all the information you would ever need on the subject.",0,1418653153,null,0,1418653591,0,cmvhx1e,t3_2pbscf,t1_cmvhx1e,t1_cmvflr4,null,1425390846,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

Should such a promise have been made by NATO as such, it would have to have been as a formal, written decision by all NATO Allies.

Per me non è inutile perché in quel concetto che tu vuoi esprimere si racchiude tutto quello di cui stiamo parlando in questo topic. L'uomo è un animale ed è sbagliata questa idea di esserci noi (uomo) e loro (animali).

Siamo tutto noi.

Condivido l'ultima parte e ringrazio di essere uomo nel 2000 perché forse vedrò la nostra razza andare da qualche parte nell'universo. 

Ma che senso ha per esempio guardare le stelle e cercare forme di vita extraterrestre se non abbiamo la giusta considerazione per quelle che abbiamo sul pianeta dove viviamo? La Terra esiste da 4 miliardi e mezzo di anni, i dinosauri hanno dominato per 160 milioni di anni (l'uomo 200 mila, 800 volte in meno) e solo negli ultimi cento abbiamo fatto danni terribili che non mettono in pericolo la vita del pianeta, al pianeta frega niente. Mettono in pericolo la **nostra** vita come razza. Ok, abbiamo composto sinfonie, scritto libri meravigliosi, ma è tutto tarato sul nostro intelletto, la nostra percezione delle cose, i nostri canoni. Per dirla in un altro modo, ci siamo guardati talmente dentro che alla fine vediamo attraverso il buco del culo e pensiamo pure che sia una cosa sensata. 

Ti rendi conto quanto queste cose che vantiamo come frutto del nostro intelletto siano in realtà un qualcosa solo legate alla labilità della nostra presenza? Siamo da un niente su questo pianeta e quando ci estingueremo torneremo ad essere niente, magari petrolio, magari diamanti.

Ecco la nostra superiorità e cazzo duro.

What Sweden does have is a high level of immigration (0,78% per year, it's not like the country is literally changing over night.

The research shows that the Lomonosov ridge is geologically connected to Greenland, which is an autonomous country in the Danish realm. The claim is made based on this connection, but it is likely that an overlapping Russian claim will be made shortly based on similar evidence. Canada may also make a claim for the same territory.

This process has been going on for a while. The deadline for submitting claims to the UN is this year, which is why it's being made now.

The Danish claim is seen as fairly aggressive, since it extends all the way to the 200 nm border of Russia.

We're well past the golden age of oil. We've got an economy that's totally dependent on a single, unrenewable resource. We've got the shortest workday in Europe. We've got an insansely generous welfare state where instead of focusing on helping those who need it the most, we spread the welfare excessively across the population as a whole. 


And yet the unions (looking at you, LO) yell about how we're working *too much*, that we're working *too hard*, that we need *longer* vacations, *more* pay and *less* work. And if you dare suggest that it might perhaps be wise to think about the future, *our* future, your sole intention is to ''ruin the rights of the common man'', and to ''eradicate the welfare state''.


You're damn right we're screwed. Leftists refuse to acknowledge the challenges we face, while the populists blame it all on the ''god damn Somalis/Muslims who are taking our jobs/stealing our welfare (funny how they never make up their minds)'' while refusing to see the broader picture.


And seriously, who's going to vote for a politician that wants to limit public expenditure? Someone who instead of repeating catchy rhetoric like ''expel the foreigners'' or ''shorter workdays'' actually has to *explain* things?

Immigration in itself is one of the greatest contributors to foreign aid. I don't have the number in my head, but out of the total foreign aid coming from Norway, a huge part of it is money sent to relatives from immigrants.

Denmark[edit] Further information: Immigration to Denmark and Crime in Denmark According to the figures from Danmarks Statistik, crime rate among refugees and their descendants is 73% higher than for the male population average, even when taking into account their socioeconomic background. A report from Teori- og Metodecentret from 2006 found that seven out of ten young people placed on the secured youth institutions in Denmark are immigrants (with 40 percent of them being refugees).[7]

Finland[edit] Further information: Immigration to Finland and Crime in Finland According to official statistics, 21.0% of rapes have been committed by foreigners in Finland.[8] Foreigners comprise 2.2% of the population.[8]

Netherlands According to a 2009 study commissioned by Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch Ballin[18], of 447 criminal files, 63% teenagers convicted of serious crime are children of parents born outside the Netherlands. In the research, 447 case files of youngsters aged from 12 to 17 were studied. All the files involved cases in which the perpetrator was convicted of a crime for which the maximum jail sentence is 8 years or more. These were murder, manslaughter, robbery with violence, extortion, arson, public acts of violence and sexual crimes. The study did not examine whether the courts or police engage in discriminatory practices with respect to youths not of ""white Dutch"" origin.

Norway The report shows that, of 131 individuals charged with the 152 rapes in which the perpetrator could be identified, 45.8% were of African, Middle Eastern or Asian origin while 54.2% were of Norwegian, other European or American origin. In the cases of ""assault rape"", i.e. rape aggravated by physical violence, a category that included 6 of the 152 cases and 5 of the 131 identified individuals, the 5 identified individuals were of African, Middle Eastern or Asian origin. In the cases of assault rape where the individual responsible was not identified and the police relied on the description provided by the victim, ""8 of the perpetrators were African / dark-skinned appearance, 4 were Western / light / Nordic and 4 had an Asian appearance"".[23]

Swizerland In Switzerland, 69.7% of prison population had no Swiss citizenship, compared to 22.1% of total resident population (as of 2008). The figure of arrests by residence status is not usually made public. In 1997, when there were for the first time more foreigners than Swiss among the convicts under criminal law (out of a fraction of 20.6% of the total population at the time), a special report was compiled by the Federal Department of Justice and Police (published in 2001) which for the year 1998 found an arrest rate per 1000 adult population of 2.3 for Swiss citizens, 4.2 for legally resident aliens and 32 for asylum seekers. 21% of arrests made concerned individuals with no residence status, who were thus either sans papiers or ""crime tourists"" without any permanent residence in Switzerland.[26]",0,1418655683,null,0,false,0,cmvixk4,t3_2p913c,t1_cmvixk4,t1_cmvc53w,null,1425390373,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Um die Leute, die in die Industrie wollen (oder auch nicht, aber es trotzdem machen), geht es ja nicht unbedingt. Sondern um die, die in der akademischen Forschung tätig sind und das auch bleiben wollen. Denn da wird die wirkliche Grundlagenforschung gemacht. Kaum ein Unternehmen gönnt sich den Luxus von Forschung, die sich evtl. erst in 10 Jahren (oder vielleicht auch nie) auszahlt. Und Postdoc-Stellen an Unis sind zwar nicht wirklich selten, aber erstens relativ mager bezahlt (Ein Postdoc unmittelbar nach der Promotion kommt in Westdeutschland auf ca. 1900 € netto) und zweitens immer befristet. D.h. man steht mit Anfang 30 da, nach 8-10 Jahren Studium/Promotion, und kann sich von befristeter Stelle zu befristeter Stelle hangeln. Aber auch nur max. 12 Jahre (abzüglich Promotionszeit, realistisch also eher 6-9 Jahre), dann hat man quasi Berufsverbot, dank Hochschulfreiheitsgesetz. Es sei denn, man habilitiert zwischenzeitlich und versucht, eine Professur zu ergattern. Aber davon gibts halt auch nicht so viele. 

Ach ja: Die 1900 € netto gelten natürlich nur, wenn man nach TV-L angestellt ist (Hausstellen). Oft hat man auch das ""Glück"", über Stipendien bezahlt zu werden.

Smaller countries have more seats in the parliament per population than large ones; conversely large ones are easier to bargain with. It's balanced.

I'd say that the likelihood of David Cameron's 2017 referendum taking place is about 40% - which is more or less that chance that David Cameron has of winning the next election. 

However, the question on EU referendum will not go away whatever the result of the next election. It isn't really about ""if"" any more. It is more a question about ""when"". At some stage within the next decade the UK will have a referendum on EU membership. The public has started to get used to the idea of having one and the movement for one is now inevitable.

Given that, it's likely he'd use being in coalition as an excuse not to have to give a referendum. It's unlikely the Lib Dems would support the Tories in holding one, and Labour have said they won't hold one, so it looks like nothing other than a Tory/UKIP coalition would result in a referendum (UKIP would make it a requirement if they prop up a government), and it's unlikely UKIP will win enough seats to be able to be a credible coalition partner.",0,1418657088,null,0,false,0,cmvjjxs,t3_2pd16k,t1_cmvjjxs,t1_cmvjbn9,null,1425390083,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

&gt; European host countries did it because they saw an opportunity to strengthen ties with the US and get payed. That doesn't make them any less guilty, it's true, but it's probably one of the key things.

I think so.  The motivation is different -- that of protecting the US at all cost.  That those costs might subvert the very thing you're trying to protect is something they ignored (or were blind to), but I still think it's a distinction worth making.

Just because there are two paths to the same torturous result -- fear and greed -- does not necessarily make them equals.  One implies an attempt at doing the right thing, at having the best interest of *something other than yourself* at heart.

Europe has never had a united army, the Napoleonic wars was a conflict between Europeans, or who do you think Napoleon fought? Aliens, ancient Egyptians? Ancient Aliens?

&gt;You guys realize how different your countries really are in culture religion, language

By your logic NATO shouldn't exist, or is it because there is certain 'primus inter pares' member that dictates the organisation?

&gt;You guys are hardly our "" bitches""...we have pretty generous trade ties

lol, from your perspective generous. The current big deal, the ""Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership"" that is under development, is laughable. 

It was revealed earlier that the US had been spying and knew just how far the European negotiators could bend when discussing terms of the deal. 
Yet the deal is still being negotiated, despite loosing any kind of bargaining position. If that isn't a sign of subservience I don't know what is.

&gt;Russia when Putin decides to cut off gas supplies to central Europe 

This is the very reason why should be more united, you know as well as I that the Russian economy depends on oil sales. If we had a united front we could turn a sellers market into a buyers market. We could instead of getting individual prices, have uniform prices for every country.

Besides Gazprom has not cut supply to Ukraine due to Ukraine not being in NATO but due to them not paying their bills in several years. Further more Hungary just recently ceased reselling gas to Ukraine, and Hungary, so the extent of Russian pressure is not limited by NATO protection but merely because the EU refuses to demand standardised pricing. 
 

The EU could provide its own safety cheaply, without the moral downfalls of CIA black sites, and military conflicts in foreign countries.
China manages to push its own interests with soft power, never sending their military outside their borders, if they can so can we. 


Again I have to ask you, if the roles were reversed, would you be satisfied?

Also as an American taxpayer, how do you feel about this? I'd be pissed,  that my military that is supposed to protect my country, is occupying foreign lands. Unless of course you enjoy the feeling of being a citizen of an empire.  

If we are going to keep this equal partnership charade going, then we might as well call for an accession of the EU into the US. That way we can at least have a vote that matters. The way things are, have led me to thoroughly lose faith in democracy and sovereignty in my country.

You said the Iniuts have some sort of shadow of Danish colonising. That is true, except they were the colonisers.

&gt;What are you talking about?

I included a link to [it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland#The_Thule_Culture_.281300_-_present.29). That is what I am talking about.

&gt;Greenland achieved autonomy in 2008[1] with a referendum, which was bilaterally ratified in Denmark as well. Greenland is likely to continue to be a part of the Danish Realm, but you are grossly overstating the power that gives Denmark over Greenland. Denmark is required to fulfil two obligations in its relationship with Greenland:
Maintain foreign relations (because Greenland does not have the human resources to maintain international diplomacy),
Maintain security (because Greenland does not have the human or economic resources to establish a military for its vast area).
Greenland is not occupied by Denmark, and Greenland is fully autonomous in all other areas than these two, including fully autonomous management of its natural resources.

I am aware of that. If you look at my history you will se I addressed the 2008 referendum specifically to another person. I never said occupied. I said Denmark is responsible for its protection. I said Denmark holds military power over Greenland. If Denmark did not concern itself with Greenlands natural resources why would they still dispute Hans Island with Canada? Why would they claim large portions of the Arctic?",0,1418658992,null,0,false,0,cmvkgk0,t3_2pcqd4,t1_cmvkgk0,t1_cmvk4xj,null,1425389502,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Natürlich versuchen Rechtsextreme solche Ängste für sich zu nutzen, genauso wie die Linken Ängste vor Nazis, und Feministen Ängste vor Männern. Aber das ist nicht der Grund warum die Leute da hin gehen.

Teilweise sind die Ängste begründet, die Linken ziehen es vor, den Kopf in den Sand zu stecken und ""Nazi"" zu schreien, als sich damit auseinanderzusetzen. De Maizière's Ansatz macht deutlich mehr Sinn.

I really hope you're being facetious here. Yes, the Inuits emigrated from North America and displaced the earlier Dorset culture in the West Arctic. To claim that Scandinavians are somehow ""more original"" Greenlanders than the Inuit is foolish.

&gt; If Denmark did not concern itself with Greenlands natural resources why would they still dispute Hans Island with Canada? Why would they claim large portions of the Arctic?

I repeat: Denmark has literally zero jurisdiction over the natural resources of Greenland. You really need to understand this. Zero, zip, squat.

As I already said, Denmark is obligated to act on behalf of Greenland in foreign affairs, including territorial claims. I'm not competent to judge the legitimacy to the Danish claim to the Arctic, but the reason that nations are competing for control is both control over trade routes and control over natural resources. Control over trade routes in international waters is a foreign policy matter, while natural resources are not.

Whether or not the claim is legitimate, Greenland has no way to make a claim other than through the Danish diplomacy, seeing as how Greenland has no capacity to deal with foreign relations at all. In this sense, Denmark is making the claim in Greenland's interest.

And consumer goods are often more expensive so it all evens out more or less. According to PPP ratings, Eastern European countries are just 1.5-2 times poorer than the west.

I am not going to comment on what you said about China as it is full of hypotheticals. What I will say is that if China hypothetically began using force I doubt the Americans would make a squeak, your two countries are symbiotically linked when it comes to economic growth, that it would be like chastising your own feet.

This is further compounded by your government's(and Europe's) weak response towards El Sisi empowerment and Mubarak's dethronement. I still remember Hilary Clinton back when she was in Obama's cabinet stumbling for a few days at first showing support for Mubarak, then only after the fact showing support for the Egyptian people. 

When Sisi came to power there was little protest, hell even invited him to official celebrations. That is just an example of the reaction towards a minor partner, a major partner like China I cannot imagine would garner too much protest.

Today, a degree isn't *that* necessary. Since capitalism entered India in 1991, the middle class has grown, and people can spend money on things that don't traditionally need degrees. For example, I know people that earn a living just fine teaching music or something. Unfortunately, most people's parents would completely disagree and be incredibly shocked to even hear of people not getting a college degree, unless they absolutely couldn't afford one.

Because the arranged marriage market is heavily dependent on parental approval, pretty much any bride/groom without a degree will be ruled out. It would be a huge dent to the ""family honour"" if their child were to marry somebody without a degree; the better the university the degree was from, the better.

I see dumping of ruble in January-March as the only way for the government to save any currency reserves that left (~340 billions atm, but only 200B liquid with 160B debt payouts during next 13 months) and use them for 2-3 years afterwards instead of spending everything till August and then defaulting.

edit: latest data. Today exchange rate has increased from 59.5r/1$ to 65-68r/1$ (highest deals on exchange) - currency lost 10-16% of value during 1 day.

1.
Arme Länder können es sich einfach nicht leisten. Und wenn die Länder versuchen die Schulden auf 0 zu bringen heißt es sie Investieren weniger. Was wir 2020 haben werden ist ein schuldenfreies Land; allerdings wird es nur den jetzt schon reichen Ländern wirklich gut gehen. Der Rest wird berühmt für schlechte Bildung (auch Schulen schließen) und kaum befahrbaren Straßen.  gesagt: die Schuldenbremse ist verfrüht.

2. 
Die Universität des Saarlandes hat mehr Studenten als vor noch einigen Jahren. Das wichtigste Detail allerdings ist, dass die meisten in diesem Zuwachs, v.a. Master Studenten, aus anderen Bundesländern kommen. Finanzieren muss das dennoch das Land alleine. 

Die Lösung: 
1. Schuldenbremse lösen,

2. Bildung entweder zentral finanzieren, oder einer komplizierteren Finanzierung, bei der die Länder je nach Anzahl der Studenten an Uni X einen Beitrag zahlen. ",0,1418664260,null,0,false,0,cmvn7a5,t3_2pd0as,t1_cmvn7a5,t1_cmvkhro,null,1425388188,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

I think UKIP doesn't currently oppose gay marriage.

I think initially they opposed it on the basis that gay people, under the civil partnership act, already had all the legal rights and responsibilities that straigt people had and therefore wasn't really necessary.

People like you are dishonest. If Erdogan and his party were unable to win the elections and used the military to capture power, you would scream bloody murder and talk about democracy. If the secular elite can't get people to vote for them, you call for a coup.

You know what the problem with a coup is? It has to be on going. It never ever solves the underlying issue that a lot of people in Turkey don't like secular parties like the CHP. Erdogan and the AKP themselves are an offshot of a party that was banned in the 1997 coup. The military thought that the coup would solve all their problems but it didn't.

I agree my friends are self-selecting. I am also not pretending to be an expert on current French social attitudes. However, I think anyone interested in French culture, history and politics would admit that these are interesting times in France. Just look at the impact of ""merci pour ce moment"" and ""le suicide francais"". Just look at the polling. I just think it would be optimistic to claim that the French are not becoming more EUsceptic.

&gt; As to parties' stances changing due to the FN, I haven't seen any noticeable effect on the left yet, although the UMP has been feeling the heat for a while now. They're still too disorganised and set to lose the next elections IMO, especially if they're represented by Sarkozy. That man is just a relic of a past no one - that includes me - wants to go back to.

I believe Hollande is set to make a big immigration speech? We will see what it contains. I don't agree with you that UMP will lose the next elections. I think they are by far the favourites to win at this stage. I agree that Sarko is not a great choice for the UMP, but the PS also doesn't have very good choices.

false,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Well, but why is that a better deal? The UK could simply remove all its representatives from the European parliament and EU institutions, and stop attending EU summits, and it would immediately get about the same deal that Iceland is getting now.

As mentioned, I don't think it is the ideal deal for the UK and I personally think that the UK should go for an entirely different deal, perhaps like Turkey's deal or perhaps like Canada's deal.

However, in the case of a Switzerland it is a better deal for example because they are free to make FTAs with other countries round the globe (which they couldn't inside the EU). And outside the EU Switzerland has its own currency and therefore its own monetary policy. A whole heap of the acquis does not apply to Switzerland, including foreign and security policy. And Norway is exempt from various fishing related laws. 

&gt; Although why any country would accept a deal that basically means something like ""regulation without representation"", is beyond me. 

It isn't beyond me at all. Maybe they don't like the direction the EU is headed and fundamentally have a problem with ever closer union?

&gt; The only reason for that would be to appease said crowd, so you could tell them ""we're not part of the EU"" (when de facto you really are, just without being represented in its institutions).

""Said crowd"" are the electorate. ""Said crowd"" probably prefer de facto membership to de jure membership and don't really care about representation at the institutions. I think they're right.

The reason why some people might oppose this, is because for they might consider ""marriage"" to be a sacred, religious institution, in addition to being a civil institution. These people might believe that under the eyes of the church gay people cannot benefit from the religious institution, therefore the civil institutions should also be separate.

Je développe une petite app métier Android pour un client. Problème, ce client n'a aucune api, aucuns webservice pour accéder à leur bdd. Donc moi, bonne poire je leur dis je vais développer les webservices, sans me douter de ce qui va suivre.

Paranos de la sécurité, ils refusent de me donner accès à aucun de leur serveur. Bien entendu, aucun document ne m'est fourni, juste un dump de la strucutre la base MySQL, un peu de code php d'un autre temps, que personne ne peut m'expliquer car l'application a été conçue il y a une dizaine d'années et personne n'y a touché depuis.

Ah, et au passage le serveur est bloqué en php 5.0.préhistoire. Donc exit les frameworks les plus connus qui demandent au minimum PHP 5.2 - 5.3. Je commence donc le dev sur mon poste, en remplissant la base à la main, en m'inspirant du code PHP qui m'a été fourni. Une fois ceci fait, je code l'appli Android tranquillement, en fournissant des release à chaque gros milestone du projet. Bien entendu, chez le client, personne ne teste, personne ne recette. Je les pousse, j'insiste pour que quelqu'un s'en charge sinon ça va être l'horreur.

Ce qui devait arriver arriva, je livre la final release le 1er décembre, tout fonctionne (sauf que personne n'a jamais testé chez le client, avec l'API installée sur leur serveur de recette.

Résultat, ça fait deux jours que je dev en aveugle, sur un serveur préhistorique, à chaque fois que je leur demande de faire une mise à jour des webservices ça prends une demi journée, bref je craque. Le client me demande pourquoi ça prends tant de temps, j'ai beau leur expliquer que c'est ultra galère, il n'y a aucun techos, donc je ne peux pas rentrer dans le spécifique...

false,Titanomakhia,ENGL,England,"&gt; It's just that the British public don't agree with the pro-EU arguments

That's not the case. In fact the pro-EU group has been growing over the last year or so. It's easy enough to pick a favourable poll or two to make it look like one side is obviously winning - for example on the 11 of October IPSOS MORI polled 1000 people and found 56% support for staying in the EU and 36% for leaving. That is clearly an anomaly much like this poll is off the trend line for the last year. In a previous comment I collated every poll taken in the last two years up to November this year and made some graphs from them to show the long term trends. I'll copy and paste that comment and the links to the graphs below. As you'll see the general trend is now marginally in favour of staying whereas before about June this year it was in favour of leaving. UKIP's rise to prominence has coincided with a decrease in the number of people wanting to leave the EU. So no, if anything the British public don't agree with the anti-EU arguments and are siding with staying in. 

&gt; [Here's a list of every poll taken in the UK on the subject in the last 2 years.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_referendum_on_United_Kingdom_membership_of_the_European_Union#Standard_polling_on_EU_membership) 
&gt; 
&gt; About two weeks ago I made a few very simple quick graphs using the data above with numbers for those in favour of staying versus those in favour of leaving. 
&gt; 
&gt; I had to use only numbers for the dates, no slashes and no letters so I figured the easiest way was to assign each week with a consecutive number. It looks unreadable but there is a key to understand it. 0 = the first week in February and 87 = the third week of November. 
&gt; 
&gt; Either way I wasn't looking to use the graph for specific reference but simply to see the trend in results and it shows that very well. 
&gt; 
&gt; Also interesting is the 'Don't know' section is also decreasing

There aren't actually a very high number of Brits working in the EU and I expect those people will have to apply for work permits. There are currently very hign numbers of Brits who work in Australia and Canada and they seem to be fine with work permits, so not sure why Brits would mind work permits in the rEU.

As I understand it, you can take stuff from all over the EU, put it together in to a product, and sell it anywhere within the EU without having to worry about tariffs, trade documentation, etc. This works because the EU has a common external tariff.

But if the UK is outside the EU and the common tariff area, the EU won't want its external tariffs bypassed by sending goods via the UK. So, there will need to be origin rules - rules determining when something is an EU/UK product and when it isn't.

For example, you might say that the wheels in your UK-assembled car are from Germany, the seats from France, the brakes from the US, the exhaust from the UK, ... and then you add up the percentages and find that by value it's 25% British, 40% EU and 35% US and therefore you can export it to the EU without applying a tariff (or by applying a low UK -&gt; EU car tariff to part of it, or whatever).

Or you might find that it's 55% US and therefore the importer has to pay the US -&gt; EU import tariff instead.

There are a lot of ways to write origin rules and I'm no expert on them. But I think it's clear that there's likely to be a lot of bureaucracy involved if the UK and EU are to be allowed to follow their own independent tariff policies, and hence trade would be less free. You couldn't just drive a lorry off a ferry in Dover or Calais with minimal paperwork.

Or the UK could stay in the common tariff area and agree to apply all the EU-decided tariffs. But that would shoot down part of some people's case for leaving - that the UK would be 'free to trade with the world' if it left the EU.

Unless you secretly concur with Erdogan his highly disturbing views or if you are just oblivious to what might happen. His views, even the more extreme parts of it, will likely be cast in law. Every day this man is allowed to remain in place the damage to Turkey will increase further.

You could of course try to reason that he is occupying his position by popular mandate, but so were many dictators in the past.

false,Titanomakhia,ENGL,England,"I commented further up this thread to someone who was claiming that the public had rejected the arguments of pro-EU people that the opposite seemed to be true as the polling seemed to show an increase in the pro-EU 'voters'. I think that's is exactly because the general public is, by and large, fairly centrist and conservative (small c) and is many are alienated by UKIP. They'll talk about how wonderful it would be to make a statement and do something radical but in the end they vote for stability and the status quo. As you say the status quo often wins out in elections because voting for change is much scarier than merely talking about it. UKIP have got people talking but when it comes to how people will actually vote people tend to think 'If it ain't too broke for me I shouldn't try and fix it'. UKIP are doing loads to stimulate the debate but I think might damage the actual anti-EU cause in the long run.

Citation?

&gt; Also Brits have easier access to work permits in AUS and CAN since both of those are Common Wealth countries. There is no way to predict how hard/easy it would be to acquire a work permit in the EU for UK citizens after you leaving the EU.

Most Brits don't want to work in the EU. Most Brits don't generally speak the languages and also most of the EU has lower pay and higher unemployment than the UK. The rEU is unlikely to want to make it extremely difficult for Brits to work there, because of the very high number of rEUropeans working in the UK.

Europe however except for a handful of countries have left us bearing the responsibility and moral obligations to us alone, while Europe complains about so and so interventions or how this and that was handled. If you don't like the U.S.'s foreign policy or interventions, Europe is at part to blame due to its inactivity and failure to accept its role as an equal bearing partner and becoming lackluster, to the point many counties in NATO doubt if article 5 was called they would be helped. If Europe wants the U.S. to change it has to change as well due to U.S.'s slow moving political adaptation / stagnation.

tl:dr - it take multiple groups or ideologies to make advances and set regulations and cooperate the advancement of human rights, because if only one country was enforcing them no one would would really care.

yea and who tells you about them, the U.S. Gov. they could hide it pretty well if they didn't want you to know. lets see a European politician admit he or she was wrong for a change when something of this scale happens instead of being flip floppily or sensationalist. lets not forget the Gov ordered the release of the torture documents and has to file reason for issuing a drone strike.

The thing is, nobody knows. They most likely would have to fulfill the same requirements, quotas and waiting periods for work permits as people coming from other non-EU countries.

false,bishey3,TURK,Turkey,"Turkey seems to be in 4 parts at the moment. Islamist, ""Gulenist"", Secularist and Kurdist. Kurds are understandably supporting their own party and looking for their rights. Secularists are also a rather stable group and basically hoping for a more Western path both in social life and politics. The rest is a bit complicated though. 

Erdogan in his first years kept his popularity with promises of EU membership and westernization all the while keeping their Islamic roots in tact. In this period he made superficial but marketable improvements in economy. After that he started to break the cohesion in the army in order to prevent a possible intervention for his future goals. (Traditionally army has intervened whenever the governing party moved away from the ideals that created the nation in the first place, essentially guarding Ataturk's legacy.)

During this period he aligned himself with Fetullah Gülen, a powerful Islamic figure who basically has his own cult. This cult's religion is almost identical to mainstream Islam but there is a huge community with a powerful figure on top of it who is calling the shots. Together they were able to control the economy and the law. Once Erdogan stopped needing Gülen's help he started his plan to get rid of him. Gülen retaliated with exposing his corruption. Erdogan answered back with the idea that Gülen is operating a parallel government -controlled by foreign forces- that is trying to destroy Turkey. The recent raids on the newspaper and the TV channel are all very important locations for Gülen to communicate with his followers. It's all political chess really. 

The biggest demographic in Turkey, mostly uneducated and located in Anatolia, is the lower (working) class. When they look at Erdogan, they see someone they can identify with. He is a muslim, he believes in superiority of men and women are only there for population growth, he explains that hard working people will be rewarded in the after life. He keeps the working class barely fed, so whenever he improves their life he is met with gratitude but he is still appreciated on other times. He has the perfect demographic. These people are apolitical, they only listen to Erdogan's speeches, only read newspapers supported by Erdogan. These people don't want sharia law, they want whatever Erdogan wants.

I agree, it is uncertain. But remember that there are far more rEUropeans in the UK than Brits in the rEU and unemployment levels in the UK are far lower than the rEU. So personally I don't think the rEU will want to make it hard for them unless the UK makes it hard for Brits currently living in the UK, which I don't think will happen.

Nein, will ich nicht. Jeder hat die freie Entscheidung, was er studieren will. Ob allerdings jeder dahergelaufene Hansel sagen wir mal Musikwissenschaft studieren werden muss, weil er mal eine Gitarre gehalten hat - wohlweislich, daß der Arbeitsmarkt begrenzt ist und die eigene Begabung bestenfalls mittelmäßig - und mit seiner Immatrikulation die Lehrbedingungen für wirkllich begabte Kommilitonen verschlechtert, das wird sich der angesprochene Zeitgenosse dann vielleicht doch überlegen.

&gt; Zumindest die Lehrer an meiner Schule hatten größtenteils einen harten Knacks nach 15-20 Jahren Berufsalltag.

Die Lehrer, bei denen ich das beobachtete, wurden Lehrer, weil ""man nicht gekündigt werden kann und eine sichere Pension hat"". Und nach 20 Jahren dann in die Arbeitsunfähigkeit. Gute, kompetente Lehrer haben oft bis zum Ende durchgezogen.

Übrigens höre ich immer Schuldenberg. Die RWTH Aachen, zum Beispiel, hat einen Jahresetat von knapp 800 Millionen Euro bei 40000 Studenten^1. Lass die Hälfte des Etats für Forschung draufgehen (In der Realität: eher mehr), dann sind wir bei 400 Millionen für 40000 Studis, oder rund 5000€ pro Semester. Bei einer Regelstudienzeit von 9 Semestern kommt man also auf 45000 € - die man dann abstottern kann. Der Betrag entspricht etwa einem Neuwagen der gehobenen Mittelklasse, oder - über einen Zeitraum von 20 Jahren - rund 190€/Monat.

Das ist nicht unmöglich, und sicher für eine *gute* Ausbildung auch nicht zu viel.

Wem das zu teuer ist, der kann sicher über ein günstigeres Fernstudium auch zum Abschluß kommen - der Etat der Fernuni Hagen ist hat nur rund 100 Millionen bei 88000 Studenten. Das muss sich dann natürlich in den Studiengebühren niederschlagen.

Im Übrigen: Ich bin auch dafür, die Beträge, die man zur Rückzahlung von Studienkrediten verwendet, voll von der zukünftigen Einkommenssteuer absetzen zu können, gewissermaßen als Verlustvortrag.

I do not believe that Turkey nor Europe will benefit from the presence of the future Turkish state as it is in the making now.

You are a hypocrite. You don't want democracy for Turkey. You don't want people to have a say on how their country is run if they disagree with you. You want them to be exactly like Western Europe. If the people don't agree then you want the military to bash some heads in and keep them quite.

Well unforutenetly for you it's too late. The military has no say in politics anymore. It is too late to put the genie back into the bottle. The days where the secular elite of Istanbul and western coast are gone. The Kurds and the rest of the country who have been oppressed for to long by the secular elites have awoken.

&gt; Unless you secretly concur with Erdogan his highly disturbing views or if you are just oblivious to what might happen. His views, even the more extreme parts of it, will likely be cast in law. Every day this man is allowed to remain in place the damage to Turkey will increase further.

I think he was a good leader. His election in 2002 was a new dawn for Turkey. Almost like the fall of the Ottoman empire without the violence. Turkey has significantly changed under. It used to be a shithole and a joke. It has completely transformed and it's a serious country now. There is respect for human rights, cultures and languages of other people. Turkey has become a nation where Christians can complain about the abuse they suffered in the past without being repressed. Alevis can openly complain about discrimination. Kurds can open up their own tv channels and speak their languages without fear. They can actually call out Erdogan for not doing enough to give them more rights. They couldn't do that back in the old days.

However he's been in power for to long. A country functions best when the leadership changes now and then. Erdogan in my opinion should hand over power to a protege.

You seem to have this wrong idea of the EU being an exclusive club of rich countries, but this is not the case. The EU benefits as well from having not so rich countries in it since labor is much cheaper there. And that (surprise surprise) benefits companies in richer countries that can off-shore their factories and sell their products everywhere at lower costs. At the same time, those poorer countries receive more investment and their growth is stronger in the long term.

Das ändert aber nichts daran, dass sie im Verhältnis zu ihrem Reichtum weniger zahlen als die gemeine Bevölkerung und dass die ungerechte Vermögensverteilung, die jedes Jahr schlimmer wird, viele junge Menschen (und deren Eltern) verzweifeln lässt, überhaupt studieren zu können und/oder sie sind gezwungen während dem Studium zu knechten. Sollte dies in einem fortschrittlichen Land Regel für (Kinder aus) Arbeiterklasse und Mittelstand sein? 
Außerdem muss der Staat durch das Immer-Reicher-Werden von 1% der Bevölkerung immer mehr sparen, was letzendlich nur der Bevölkerung schadet. Die Politiker haben ja ihre Tausenden €s im Monat und die Reichen werden parallel zur Staatsverschuldung reicher.... was für ein Zufall! 

Ich habe hier eine interessante Grafik dazu: http://i.imgur.com/kPH6q1V.png
Natürlich war das Vermögen vor einigen Jahrzehnten auch unfair verteilt, aber zumindest so fair, dass Politiker korrupt und Superreiche reich sein konnten, ohne dass die Bevölkerung leiden musste (bzw in diesem Ausmaß. Die rechten Pegida-Demonstrationen sind ja nur ein klassisches Symptom einer immer ärmer werdenden Bevölkerung, wie auch schon Ende der 1920ern). Und ja, dafür dass immer mehr Menschen in relativer Armut leben müssen, kann man dies als schlimm bezeichnen. Ich meine.... in welchem Land willst du leben? Willst du in einer harten Leistungsgesellschaft leben, die bald tunesisches Niveau von 2008 erreicht hat oder in einem künstlerisch und wissenschaftlich wertvollen Land, wo die Menschen sich ohne Geldsorgen entfalten können und die Kultur wieder erblühen kann?

false,sisko7,EURO,Europa,"&gt; Wieso hat man angst vor dem Islam, wenn er 5 % der Bevölkerung ausmacht. Total unverständlich. 

6% der Muslime in Deutschland sind islamismusaffin und gewaltaffin (politisch-religiös motivierte Gewalt). Bei den Fundamentalisten (40% der Muslime in Deutschland) ist der Anteil mit 17% besonders hoch. 

Wir haben praktisch 250.000 Islamistenversteher in Deutschland, die auch von Hasspredigern radikalisiert werden können.

Fundamentalisten neigen auch am ehesten dazu, sich ausschliesslich in Parallelgesellschaften zu bewegen, und im Freundeskreis selten oder nie deutsch zu sprechen. Der Anteil von Muslimen in Deutschland, die die Trennung zwischen Religion und Staat ablehnen, beträgt 22%. Besonders junge Muslime lehnen die Trennung zwischen Religion und Staat ab. 

10% der Muslime haben eine sehr hohe Distanz zu Demokratie und Rechtsstaat, und befürworten Körperstrafen im Sinne der Scharia. 56% der Muslime haben eine mittlere Demokratiedistanz, 48% finden die Demokratie ist mitschuld an der Kriminalität. 90% der Muslime finden, dass kein Muslim das Recht hat, im Namen Allahas Menschen zu töten.

Verständlich, dass die Ossis keine Lust darauf haben, dass auch in ihren Städten fundamentalistische Parallelgesellschaften einziehen.

Anteil der bekannten Rechtsextremisten in der deutschen Bevölkerung ohne Migrationshintergrund: 0.03%  (22000)

Anteil der bekannten Islamisten in der muslimischen Bevölkerung in Deutschland: 1% (42500)

Es stimmt mich traurig, dass viel zu viele Deutsche die Augen vor diesen Problemen verschliessen.
