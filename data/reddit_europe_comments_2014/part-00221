* Try to use the language. Whether it's through this subreddit, or if you find a Skype partner to do a language exchange, you must use the language. 

* Have a definite goal, something for you to work towards in the short/medium term to motivate you to practice. It needs to be something concrete, rather than the amorphous ""get better"". I am learning German so I can talk to her when I see her in another couple months. I also have shorter goals, such as specific issues that I want to focus on.

* Don't use flashcards. Instead use SRS. I use Memrise, and I'm a big fan of Anki as well. I understand there is another option for Mac, but I'm unfamiliar with it.

You can't buy a Metro card in advance. You have to buy one in Rome. They're available either from the machines in any Metro station, the ticket booth in any major train station, or most tabaccai (tobacconists).

These cards give you unlimited access to all of Rome's public transport (buses, trams, metro, commuter trains) except the 'extraurbano' trains and the airport. You can buy them for different lengths of time: 100 minutes (unlimited but one Metro trip only), 1 day, 1 week, 1 month. 

However if you're in Rome to sightsee, then the Roma Pass (3 days - €36; 2 days - €24) is your best deal: it gives you unlimited transport, plus free entrance to two major sights, and a discount on subsequent ones.

For more details on all of the above, plus a lot of other tips including how to avoid being pickpocketed, please see the [Public Transport](http://romevacationtips.com/how-to-use-romes-public-transport/) section of my website RomeVacationTips.com.

The UK got this land from the Jordanians, who actually didn't really want it because it was full of pesky Palestinians.

Then the people in charge of the USA suddenly stopped hating Jews when they realized they too were Zionists, just not Jews, and got on the bandwagon. And the UK and the US thought ""Hey, this land is full of people the neighbors find pesky (Palestinians) so why not put here the other people the neighbors find really pesky (Jews)?! Great idea! Let's do it.""

And there was also the fact that both in the UK and the US the people in charge of giving land to Zionists were also Zionists and therefore believed in similar fairy-tales to those the Jews believed in. And these fairy-tales could only come true if the Jews got a piece of land right where they were the least wanted, right where it was the least practical to raise a nation out of nowhere.

But in the same way, spoiled child brats get what they want, the Jews demanded that their nation be built there, against all practicality and common-sense. And the people in charge of the UK and the US also demanded it because they to wanted the fairy-tales to come true. To this day, Zionists are known to not make concessions, so why should they not have been like this from the start? So they were. And they made a nation there, not with the goal of making a proper nation that could develop properly, but simply for the (religious) principle of it. ""It's my way or the Yawehway."" 

And so they gave that land to the Zionist Jews. And they gave them all they needed to build a nation. But, as in Hollywood, ""Location, location, location"". It was just a terrible set.

Just don't push in front of a queue if you don't want people to think you're a prick; you probably won't be 'removed from the premises' but you might get some nasty stares and tutting

&gt;Don't talk loudly or quickly whether in public or private.

This one's a bit true... you can talk as quickly as you want I've never heard anyone have a problem with that

&gt;Don't stick your finger out or look over your cup when drinking tea, it's rude.

R u having a laff m8

&gt;Remember to look right before crossing the road.

Look both ways and you'll be fine, like everywhere else

&gt;Don't insult the Queen or the monarchy in general. We live here and thus are fully aware of the pros and cons.

Just a simple matter of keeping your nose out of business you've not got a clue about

&gt;Don't talk about money, politics or religion. Especially don't talk about religion if you're Catholic.

If you're catholic? What are you smoking?

&gt;Do or don't tip, it doesn't really matter.

Tipping here is just for really good service; most people tip a couple of quid but there's really no need or expectation

&gt;Look up the unwritten rules before visiting a pub.

I go to pubs and I haven't got a clue what unwritten rules you're talking about

&gt;The whole V for Victory symbol is basically the same as giving the middle finger here. 

Not quite as harsh, but yeah it's a 'swear' gesture

&gt;Being on the phone in a public place is frowned upon, but really, really frowned upon in quiet places.

True

&gt;Don't kiss or hug or be touchy-feely with someone unless you're best friends.

Mostly true, some people are just more affectionate. Just make sure they're okay with it first...

&gt;When you've finished eating, put you knife and fork on the plate facing up whilst next to each other, so the waiter knows to collect your plate.

This is etiquette sure, but waiters usually will just come and ask if you've finished anyway if you look like you're finished

&gt;Give your seat to anyone who is older, female, pregnant or disabled.

Give your seat up for someone just because they're a woman? Do one

&gt;Women will extend their hand to shake yours first.

Uh, okay

&gt;Hold the door open for people coming in with you and thank anyone who holds the door open for you.

True, just politeness

&gt;If someone doesn't thank you, it's 100% okay to slam it in their face.

Not true, the British way is a non-confrontational, passive-aggressive tut

&gt;Always arrive on time, unless it's a dinner party.

Not sure how it is elsewhere but would have thought ""arrive at the agreed upon time"" is pretty universal

&gt;If it is a dinner party, arrive ten to twenty minutes after the given time.

Or just arrive when you want, nobody gives a shit. Would be more annoyed if you arrive really late than if you arrive dead on time

&gt;Wait until everyone is seated and the host begins to eat before eating in a restaurant or somebody's home.

Just eat when you want - again, nobody gives a shit

&gt;If you're invited to somebody's house for dinner, bring a small gift for the hostess - wine, chocolates, flowers and champagne are good, but sometimes people give books or other personal things when more familiar.

This is in no way required or expected. It is just a nice gesture if you want to do it. Quit getting your facts on Britishness from fucking Come Dine With Me

&gt;Privacy is really, really highly valued here.

Sure, everyone likes their privacy. People like to talk to each other though so unless you're in London feel free to strike up a conversation with a stranger

&gt;Invitations to someone's garden are usually signs of good friendship, we take huge pride in them and value the private sanctuary of them.

You are making us sound like right wankers you realise this

&gt;If someone says something is good, it's excellent. 

Or it's good. Or it's bad but they don't want to hurt your feelings. Read into how people say their words, not just what they say.

&gt;In Northern Ireland, religion and politics are an utter minefield, so steer well clear of those topics.

Actually decent advice there

Is Germany's current success (if it can be called that; I mean, things aren't exactly rosy for a lot of Germans) really the result of these reforms or the result of providing the credit and the exports that fuelled the boom in the less competitive Eurozone countries? 

If that narrative made sense, then why is [Germany's economy now slowly but steadily again faltering](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/07/10/uk-europe-economy-idUKKBN0FF1CG20140710)? Why was the reward of its supposed virtue almost as short-lived as boom the profligate countries of the Eurozone enjoyed?

Consider, for example, how in the past, before the euro, Germany's exports had to out-compete the effects of currency devaluation but now they don't. Consider how the euro gave a lot of credit to the weak peripheral economies and they spent that importing stuff from Germany.

&gt; The undertaking began in secret in the summer of 2003. The German economy had been stuck in a chronic slump since the beginning of the new century with growth stagnating near zero. Unemployment was on the rise and the budget deficit was consistently growing.

&gt; The previous year, Eichel had only narrowly managed to avoid a deficit warning from the European Commission. But it soon became apparent that the situation was not going to improve in the near future. Because Schröder and Eichel shied away from cleaning up the budget by way of austerity, further warnings from Brussels, or even monetary penalties, seemed merely a matter of time.

&gt; Schröder, though, found a solution. If it wasn't possible to adjust the government's finances to the Stability Pact, then the Stability Pact would simply have to be adjusted to the state of German finances.

&gt; Schröder tried to secure the support of French President Jacques Chirac and British Prime Minister Tony Blair. ""The initiative will gain clout if the United Kingdom is also on board,"" reads an internal Chancellery memo. ""Therefore, please maintain absolute confidentiality until a final agreement is reached.""

&gt; The memo describes what Schröder had in mind: ""Germany and France must be able to create necessary growth incentives, even when the 3 percent deficit threshold is exceeded."" For the sake of the economy, in other words, no country should be forced to save unless it absolutely wanted to.

See how it goes? Germany cannot be bound by rules that may restrict its growth! It must have an option to spend its way out of a recession! It's only fair after all! ",0,1406858029,null,0,false,0,cjdlcns,t3_2c88gh,t1_cjdlcns,t1_cjd6t6a,null,1435008944,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Sharing groceries among 6-12 people sounds like a real hassle. Then again in Sweden I've shared a kitchen with 55 people in the school and things didn't get stolen ^often

Of course it depends on the people you live with and how many there are etc. I just know that there are three things that *will* get stolen, used without your permission in the hopes you won't realize it or they will tell you afterwards, when it's too late and you would have liked it for yourself:

Any kind of alcohol (especially beer), pizza (or stuff like pizza), everything you can put on bread (from peanut butter to cheese). I lived in a house with some other German exchange students in Japan and made this experience myself. It seems we Germans are a thieving people as long as we are poor students ;) Funny story: I shared my foodmoney with a friend. We bought our stuff together and usually marked our stuff - I bought bread once, put it in on the table to mark it, but had to go back to my room, as my telephone rang. I come back, my friend sits there, grinning and telling me ""look, I found bread for free"". He already had eaten half of it -.-

I swear, every time I went to visit one of them and we put beer in the fridge, half of it would be gone, unless we drank it in the kitchen (and even then people would open it, see the beer, see us drink it and immediately ask if they can have some). Usually my friend would have some pizza there in case we got hungry, but as we went for it, it would be gone. I don't know if it's just the way in Tuebingen, but it really sucked.

One of my friends bought himself a mini-fridge, another went as far as renting an apartment with his brother, as soon as he started studying in Tuebingen as well.

* U-1 Persons unemployed 15 weeks or longer, as a percent of the civilian labor force - 2.9%

* U-2 Job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs, as a percent of the civilian labor force - 3.1%

* U-3 Total unemployed, as a percent of the civilian labor force (official unemployment rate) - 6.1%

* U-4 Total unemployed **plus discouraged workers**, as a percent of the civilian labor force plus discouraged workers - 6.5%

* U-5 Total unemployed, plus discouraged workers, **plus all other persons marginally attached to the labor force**, as a percent of the civilian labor force plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force - 7.3%

* U-6 Total unemployed, plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force, **plus total employed part time for economic reasons**, as a percent of the civilian labor force plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force - 12.1%

&gt;Of the 40.7 million who were uninsured in 2013, 14.5 million gained coverage, but 5.2 million of the insured lost coverage, for a net gain in coverage of approximately 9.3 million. This represents a drop in the share of the population that is uninsured from 20.5 percent to 15.8 percent.

So right now is actually worse then what you thought it was the worse situation in US... 

It's not only about uninsured, do you have any idea how it cost to give birth in US? Or how much is a day of hospitalization? Quick googling...
&gt;Women with insurance pay out of pocket an average of $3,400, according to a survey by Childbirth Connection, one of the groups behind the maternity costs report. Two decades ago, women typically paid nothing other than a small fee if they opted for a private hospital room or television.

Imagine you have an appendectomy and you have to stay in hospital a day extra... if you don't have a job that ruins you (that's what I was talking about). Sure, Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) helps a lot but it doesn't solve the problem and what if you are one of the 16% or so uninsured? 

&gt; According to one angry Reddit user, his bill for treating appendicitis and the resulting appendectomy procedure was $55,000.
Twenty-year-old Nick Gonzales had his appendix removed at Sutter General Hospital in Sacramento, Calif. in October 2012. He later received a bill for $55,029.31. 
His insurance covered most of it, but he was still expected to pay $11,119.53. He told CBS Sacramento that the money “is still a ton at this time in my life.”

&gt; Sunday early morning. E, aged 20, with his boyfriend are on their way to Gazi (gay-friendly neighbourhood in Athens). When the reach the Underground (Métro) Square, they are attacked with homophobic motives. 4-5 people begin throwing slurs at them, and one of those hits them, while the rest laugh. The Police shows up after 2.5 hours, even though this is a very central area in Athens. The tragic irony is that this racist attack comes only a few days after the biggest LGBT Pride event in Athens. 

Métro seems to be the favourite place for homophobic attacks. I know at least 3 cases of transwomen being beaten up in métro cars in Athens while everyone just looked the other way. ",0,1406869790,null,0,false,0,cjdq5cj,t3_2c5wqg,t1_cjdq5cj,t1_cjcgv5t,null,1435011411,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

The people in rural Anatolia progressed forward, while their relatives living in Germany got left behind. 

If you look at the migration numbers, there are more people moving back to Turkey than there are people coming to Turkey. The majority of people moving back are young people of Turkish descent who grew up in Germany. They are moving back because living in Istanbul or Izmir allows them more freedom than living in the Turkish community in Germany. 

After visiting Istanbul for a few years ago I totally understood why Turkey wants to (and should) be inside the EU - the majority of young progressive Turks on the west coast feel European.

de plus, il mettent plus en danger qu'autre chose la minorite qu'ils estiment vouloir defendre.

j'ai l'intime conviction que les manifestations n'auraient jamais derapes si cette fameuse milice ne serait pas venues provoquer les manifestants (qui etaient loin d'etre uniquement des ""arabes"" au passage...).

Going with this
&gt; I came to learn -&gt; Ich bin gekommen, um zu lernen

Sull'Africa però, sono molto più scettico. Durante lo scorso anno ho avuto coinquilini da Niger, Tanzania, Etiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda. **TUTTI** hanno confermato quello che già sapevo: Gheddafi è stato fatto fuori anche per impedire che il suo progetto di sviluppo per l'Africa potesse decollare. Si trattava principalmente di una banca di investimenti che potesse gestire un discreto patrimonio. Quindi, in sintesi, per l'Africa non c'è speranza, almeno non a breve termine. 

L'unica alternativa all'asse Washington-Londra è l'asse Buenos Aires (i.e. MercoSur)-Mosca (BRICS). Ma stai pur certo che sua maestà la Regina e il premio nobel per la pace faranno *di tutto* per impedire che questa ampia parte del mondo possa vivere una stagione di sviluppo e progresso (a cui la UE ha spontaneamente rinunciato).

For example using a nuclear weapon (little known fact, the US had radio broadcasts and dropped leaflets warning people to evacuate, but since the weapons were so new nobody believed US claims of their potential destruction). 

Many on this sub will gladly ignore the Holocaust in Germany and Dutch atrocities in Indonesia, and many others awful things their countries were doing at the same time. So my apologies if that is not what you were doing, it happens a lot on this sub. 

As I said, I definitely do not take that view. I went to Northern Iraq two winters ago because I wanted to meet Iraqis (not the ones living in the US because they tend to have an overly positive view). If I could hop on a plane tomorrow and go anywhere, my number one destination would be Pakistan, both for the natural beauty and to meet Pakistanis (obviously). So as long as you are not one of the many on here that will demonize things the US has done but ignore things their country has done I fully accept criticism. It just gets a bit absurd when people type out an entire list of things the US has done, but refuse to acknowledge anything European nations have done during the same timeframe.

&gt; L'État israélien se condamne à des opérations régulières à Gaza ou en Cisjordanie, cette stratégie terrifiante parce qu'elle condamne les Palestiniens au sous-développement et à la souffrance, terrifiante parce qu'elle condamne Israël peu à peu à devenir un État ségrégationniste, militariste et autoritaire. C'est la spirale de l'Afrique du Sud de l'apartheid avant Frederik De Klerk et Nelson Mandela, faite de répression violente, d'iniquité et de bantoustans humiliants. C'est la spirale de l'Algérie française entre putsch des généraux et OAS face au camp de la paix incarné par de Gaulle.

et ça : 

&gt; Troisième vérité qui brûle les lèvres et que je veux exprimer ici: oui il y a une terreur en Palestine et en Cisjordanie, une terreur organisée et méthodique appliquée par les forces armées israéliennes, comme en ont témoigné de nombreux officiers et soldats israéliens écœurés par le rôle qu'on leur a fait jouer.

auxquels j'adhère et d'autres beaucoup moins comme ceux-là : 

&gt; Ayons le courage de dire une première vérité: il n'y a pas en droit international de droit à la sécurité qui implique en retour un droit à l'occupation et encore moins un droit au massacre.

Malheureusement si. Quand on a bombardé la Lybie, on a tué [des femmes et des enfants aussi](http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/monde/20111220.OBS7180/libye-ces-morts-que-l-otan-ne-veut-pas-voir.html). On lui a fait dire ce qu'on veut au droit international. Et la guerre donne le droit au massacre : si vous pensez le contraire, renseignez-vous sur bomber Harris et les bombardements alliés des villes allemandes durant la seconde guerre mondiale.

Le droint international autorise les victimes collatérales si il y a un objectif militaire et une raison de frapper. Comme le Hamas bombarde israël avec ses roquettes, Israël a le droit de riposter (j'insiste sur le mot droit qui n'a pas le même sens que le mot devoir : Israël n'est pas *obligé* de riposté, mais il y est *autorisé*, la nuance a son improtance vis à vis du droit international : ce n'est pas parcequ'une action est *légale* qu'elle est *légitime* )

&gt; l n'y a pas de partenaire en Palestine car les partisans de la paix ont été méthodiquement marginalisés par la stratégie du gouvernement d'Israël. La logique de force a légitimité hier le Hamas contre le Fatah. Elle légitime aujourd'hui les fanatiques les plus radicaux du Hamas voire le Djihad islamique. 

Mouais, Israël n'a pas aidé mais l'islamisme du Hams et le soutien en sous-main de l'Iran a joué lui aussi.

true,shevagleb,SWIT,Ukrainian/Russian/Swiss who lived in US,"The argument that Russians make is that the US is trying to get a piece of Ukraine - and on some level I agree with them - Kerry &amp; Biden's sons now have cushy board level jobs in the Ukrainian state gas company, and had Putin not taken over Crimea I can envisage a future where Kiev would have cancelled the renewal of the Sevastopol naval base lease in favor of closer ties to NATO. 

Nevertheless I am appalled at the rest of what is coming out of Russia : the neo-nazi line (yes they exist, no they didnt take over Ukraine and the hate crime levels haven't spiked as a result of their presence and participation in the Maidan overthrow), the claims that evil Ukraine is oppressing Russian speakers - no - greedy bureaucrats and politicians have been doing a shit job across the country - they're not nor have hey been targetting ethnic Russians. 

There was a small town newspaper editor who actually wrote a sarcastic letter to Putin in the wake of Crimea, asking him to liberate his oblast from corrupt oppressors (the local oligarchs and politicians) because the living conditions were terrible.

Ukraine's new leadership's hands aren't clean - we dont have conclusive evidence as to who ordered the snipers on the protestors and cops (what lead to Yanik fleeing the country, 200 dead people later) and there are suspicions that it was a false flag op by the right wing leaders of the protests. 

There are some in Ukraine who are a little overzealous with the anti-Russian nationalistic rhetoric and some that overlook incidents like the burning of pro-Russian protestors in Odessa because they view all the victims as ""asking for it""... Again its ""good"" vs ""evil"" with the ""good"" guys being able to get away with whatever.

IDK it's tricky. I think a good chunk of Crimea and the Donbas want closer ties to Russian and dont want to lose potential ties in favor of the EU and NATO - a Gallup poll in the spring supports my opinion - but they didnt engineer the uprisings - some jumped on the bandwagon but its clearly Moscow &amp; co pulling the strings. The leadership, weapons and funding is coming out of Russia. Are these private individuals and funds? Hard to believe. Just like its hard to buy into ISIS being privately funded and having no ties to any govt in the Gulf. 

The situation in the East is everybody calling the others bluff - Yanik called the peoples bluff - the people called Putin's bluff - and the West did too. Only nothing is decelerating, quite the opposite, and that makes me scared for my countries and my people.

true,King_of_Avalon,EURO,Croatia,"I just want to piggyback on this to explain a bit further.

I've had fun with this as well. I went to high school in America (specifically Florida). There was another girl in my French class who was from London. Together, the two of us were asked if there were cinemas in England, I think the girl was asked if there were *cars* in England, if there was internet (this was in 2004), and so many other stupid fucking questions.

But here's the thing - how much of the television and films that you (and anyone else in Europe) watch that's from the US? I'm guessing around 80-90%? Well in the US, it's 100%. With the exception of a few people who watch *Doctor Who* or *Top Gear* on BBC America, Americans basically consume media made solely in the US. As a result, even well educated Americans can often know shockingly little about the outside world. It just doesn't factor into the American way of life. Only about 30% of Americans even own a passport. 

I mention this because it's important to note the impact this has on the American psyche. Ask an American to picture a city in Africa, and the first thing they'll immediately think of is [this](http://www.conquistaweb.it/harambee/img/kenya/kibera_nairobi.jpg). Not [Nairobi](http://www.kicc.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Nairobi-night.jpg), or [Johannesburg](http://maharishiinstitute.org/images/uploads/johannesburg_view_image.jpg) - the default will always be abject poverty or tribal huts. The same with Europe. Ask them to picture a European city and it will be this romanticised, almost 19th century portrait of a European city without the cars, the traffic, all of the things that go along with a modern society.

This is important because it shapes the way that Americans interact with the world. It goes some way towards explaining why people are willing to vote and support wars in the middle east. It's a lot easier to think that you're spreading freedom and democracy when you think the enemy looks more like [this](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Afghan-residents-sit-outside-a-hut-on-the-outskirts-of-Herat-AFP.jpg) and less like [this](http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/i/streams/2013/October/131010/8C9335754-pb-131010-kabul-water-park-mn-03.jpg) (a water park in Kabul). 

Furthermore, it gets to the heart of the whole ""we're number one!"" mentality. If you think the rest of the world (with the exception of Japan) looks positively mediaeval, that the technology in Europe must be at least 20 years behind, that people in the rest of the developed world die in dirty hospital corridors waiting for treatment, then you start to understand the centuries-old superiority complex of Americans. If the rest of the world is measurably shitty, then obviously it follows logically that America is in fact number one, even if you've never left your home state and have no idea what the rest of the world is even like. 

So yes, /u/BoilerButtSlut is right, you will need to be prepared for stupid questions from stupid people, but know that they don't mean ill by it. Many of them genuinely assume that because you're not American, you must necessarily have a lower quality of life, at least technologically, because no place is obviously as great as the USA.

People will usually make varying degrees of effort to get your name right, and then will settle on some version or abbreviation that's manageable. You can speed this up by suggesting some version that worked in the past. :-) (For me, it's Derek instead of Dirk, which is close enough).

Asian names in western countries are worse by far, e.g. the poor Chinese will never get the proper syllable tone, and some consonants are somewhat different. That's why they sometimes do adopt new names (it also seems a bit of a tradition in China), but westerners in western countries really shouldn't need to.

Tutto il resto sono mezze verita', trucchetti semantici, sottintesi, che approfittano della tua ignoranza per farti indignare.

Mezze verita':  

* Il nome di Renzi non era indicato sulla scheda: vero, ma non vuol dire nulla: per costituzione il presidente del consiglio lo indica il presidente della repubblica e lo vota il parlamento.

* FIrme referendum: (come gia' spiegato) all'aumento delle firme corrisponde una diminuzione del quorum, il vero ostacolo ai referendum.

* una magistratura controllata dal capo della maggioranza:
nella nuova riforma non cambiano le modalita' di elezione del csm, Berlusconi per il solo fatto di avere la maggioranza qualche anno fa, controllava la magistratura?

* un senato di immuni: si tratta di un'immunita' molto limitata, non diversa da quella che hanno i parlamentari eletti. E sono eletti esattamente come il presidente della repubblica, e' un'elezione di secondo livello.

Trucchetti semantici:

* parlamentari non scelti dai cittadini: cosa vuol dire scelti? e chi sono i cittadini? I parlamentari del M5S sono stati scelti dai cittadini? In realta' sono stati scelti da qualche migliaio di iscritti.
E quelli del PD, votati da milioni di persone? Si ma la scelta era limitata.
E quelli che hanno votato PDL, non hanno scelto Alfano invece che Bersani?
Se ci fossero le preferenze sarebbero scelti? Alle scorse elezioni europee meno di un quarto degli elettori hanno espresso preferenze, quindi gli altri non hanno scelto? Lo vedi come quella frase non vuol dire un cazzo?

Sottintesi fondati sulla tua ignoranza:

* 'casualmente' uguale a quella della p2. il piano della p2 prevedeva ""ripartizione di competenze fra le due Camere (funzione politica alla CD e funzione economica al SR)"". Renzi vuol far fare al senato da mediatore fra regioni e stato, direi che non e' uguale per niente.
Nel piano c'e' anche l'abolizione delle province. Quindi 'casualmente' il M5S e' piduista.

In the less likely scenario in which the final round is between FN and PS, then I think the FN have a better shot as I think some of the centre right will go for FN rather than PS again.

But also that the European Central Bank is completely independent, so the struggling countries couldn't use monetary politics to actively counteract the high debts, and were doomed to strict to the less effective fiscal politics.
Maybe this system is the part there you can blame Germany, because the European Central Bank equates essential the German central bank. Although this separation between monetary and administration power guaranteed price stability in Germany for serval decades.
I'm a aware that the single currency area killed the natural exchange correction rates leading to current account deficits in some countries and to current account surplus in other countries like Germany or Netherlands.
But you have to notice that deficits have been caused by insufficient productivity and competitiveness.

In the end Germany have paid 28% do the total costs caused by the mismanagement of their European neighbors. By its nature government action isn't altruistically because the government is committed to its citizen in the first place and Germany has had no interest in a insolvent sales market. 

A important thing is the mood of the German voters. Many people are convinced Germany shouldn't pay anything for the debts of other countries because they honestly believe the people of Greece for example are just lazy and greedy. Having this opinion in a recognizable part of the population it is not easy to make politics against the voters will. Nether less such a large part of the population shares this opinion that a new right wing party were formed, the AFD ( alternative for Germany, which wants to split up the European Union in a northern union including the rich countries and a southern union which includes the poor countries)

German freeways are scary for slow/small/shitty cars.

Repeat 10 times. I actually rear-ended someone that way once. I must have been the only person on the road without ABS. There wasn't much damage, but still, *fuck*.

German drivers also tend to do the same in cities. They won't go *over* the speed limit, but they'll hit it in half a second and stay there until they hate to stop at the next red light.

Ha detto che mamme o babbi, sempre di due aveva bisogno, che sua mamma per tirare su lui e i fratelli doveva lavorare durissimo e non aveva mai tempo. Mi disse, testuali parole ""Che mi importa se fossero state due madri lesbiche o due padri gay?Cosa poteva importare a me, che spendevo il tempo coi miei cugini e amici in paese?Io volevo qualcuno che mi soffiasse il naso, che mi difendesse perché ero sempre il più piccolino e che avesse tempo per me la sera. Volevo che mamma non fosse sempre cosi' stanca. A quei tempi avrebbe fatto scalpore, certo, ma faceva anche scalpore che mamma avesse deciso di fare l'ostetrica per vivere. Faceva scalpore anche che le donne mettessero i pantaloni, ma oggi mi sa che le cose sono un attimino diverse."". 

Questo mi disse mio padre, anni fa, quando la mia migliore amica fece coming out e io gli chiesi cosa ne pensasse su tutta la linea.

Mio babbo di ruoli da maschio o da femmina non ha mai avuto bisogno. Quando ero piccola si é preso cura di me come mia mamma. Disciplina e regole che davano lui e mia madre erano le stesse. Attenzione alla scuola anche. Non é che abbiano mai riflettuto su chi facesse cosa. Sa cucinare, pulire, lavare e stirare, e quando non lavora fino a tardi lo fa. E' il più ordinato in casa, questo é sicuro.

Quando era piccolo, il paese intero di ruoli da osservare ne aveva a bizzeffe, per lui e per gli altri ragazzini. E per dirla tutta, i padri nel suo paese da che mondo é mondo stavano fuori a lavorare, non avevano quasi alcun ruolo o rapporto diretto coi bambini, almeno quelli che conosceva lui. Quello che gli mancava era qualcun altro solo per sé, o almeno più tempo con sua mamma.

Quindi si, mio babbo avrebbe preferito due babbi o due mamme stabili, sereni e non un solo genitore povero e disperato.

Nah, or it depends. Germany for example: German law enforcement are pissed because they can't go directly to Facebook's datacenter and seize all servers remotely involved with a case. They have to contact FB first, request info, etc.

While with German providers they can (and usually do) get a search warrant and seize any server that they believe is involved in a case. The search order here is rather a formality and it's very very rare that a judge won't sign a search warrant.

true,rewboss,UKGB,Expat from UK,"Slang is nearly impossible to teach. There are many different types of slang, plus there's what /u/Gogkti and /u/ma-int mentioned, which is actually dialect rather than slang: dialect is regional, slang is... well, nobody's really been able to give a good definition, but it's to do with belonging to certain socio-economic groups.

And this is the problem, because attempting to use slang when you don't belong to that particular group can backfire on you. You know how embarrassing it is when your parents try to speak like your friends? Like that.

For example, if you live in an urban area with a large Turkish population, you may come into contact with ""Kanak sprak"", a slang -- actually an ""ethnolect"" -- spoken by second and third-generation Turks living in Germany. Whatever you do, though, never refer to a Turk as a ""Kanake"": like the English ""N-word"", it's okay for members of that particular ethnic group to use it, but it's an insult if anyone else does. And don't try greeting a young Turk with ""Hey Alder!"" They'll just think you're trying to make fun of them.

You don't really need to know slang, to be honest, mostly because the people you're most likely to come into contact with at first will automatically switch to a standard dialect when talking to you. And people in a professional capacity will always use standard language: if a police officer wants to see your driving licence, he will always ask for your ""Führerschein"", never ""Lappen"".",0,1406884783,null,0,false,0,cjdtwz4,t3_2caoi1,t1_cjdtwz4,t3_2caoi1,null,1435013021,10,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,10

While La Rioja and Cantabria became regions on their own around 1980 (just like Madrid, BTW), their differences with ""inland Castille"" are less cultural and more dictated by geographical and economic circumstances: Cantabria in particular is very maritime, in stark difference with landlocked Castille. I wouldn't say that the people from any of those two regions would feel ""offended"" if you called them Castillians, whereas both feel very strongly about **not** being *Basque*.

Ironically, in the whole of Spain, the people most likely to feel offended if called ""Castillian"" are those from Leon, which merged with ""Old Castille"" when the modern Spanish regions were formed...",0,1406885735,null,0,false,0,cjdu3c5,t3_2c8qm6,t1_cjdu3c5,t1_cjdtltj,null,1435013132,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I contatti per l'Africa sono attualmente gestiti dalle società petrolifere che fanno da ministri degli esteri ombra, quindi l'USA ha già i contatti ma non sono benvisti a causa dei metodi poco ortodossi che usano, la Cina si è fatta dare un botto di materie prime dal Congo in cambio delle strade, la Russia ha in protezione la Siria e Eni rimane l'ultima bandierina europea sullo scacchiere, che cerca di gestire le cose col modello Mattei. 

In questo scenario un'Africa tranquilla è più propensa al modello Eni, un'Africa instabile lascia il terreno ai servizi segreti americani che mangiano il mangiabile e il modello BRICS sta nel mezzo.

Lo stesso vale per il MercoSur, dove anche noi europei siamo nella partita del mercato (FIAT e TIM in Brasile ad esempio, ma anche Siemens tanto per capirci).

Se a legiferare c'e' stato per decenni un esercito di incompetenti, di chi pensi sia la colpa?

Ma te, in che tipo di societa' vuoi vivere te lo sei mai chiesto? 

No, non sto parlando di 'siamo tutti fratelli' e altre stronzate, sto parlando di equita', autonomie,  libera iniziativa, libero mercato, stato sociale, previdenza,  difesa. Perche' non e' vero niente che Destra e Sinistra non esistono piu', le differenze ci sono eccome, in ognuno dei punti che ho citato; e se non sei te a scegliere poi perdi anche il diritto di lamentarti (e tipicamente lo prendi pure in qlo).

Forse invece di aspettare il Verbo del Guru di turno che ti dica cosa devi pensare ti converrebbe cercare di recuperare il tempo che hai perduto. La democrazia costa sforzo, e fossi in te mi metteri a correre.

Ah, a proposito di Grillo, un'altra cosa: quando senti qualcuno parlare di problemi complessi e proporre soluzioni iniziando la frase con ""e' semplice"", questo qualcuno e' in malafede o e' un mentecatto.

Le soluzioni semplici a problemi complessi non esistono, altrimenti i problemi medesimi sarebbero gia' stati TUTTI risolti. Vale per la decrescita felice, le biowashball, la web-democrazia, le stampanti 3D e tutta una serie di altre stronzate.

Fermo restando che l'Argentina è piuttosto ricca di materie prime (e che ha 8 reattori nucleari che lavorano, altro che i Verdi), ti riporto un piccolo scambio epistolare avvenuto tra me e un mio amico/colega ricercatore che si occupa di matematica finanziaria. Si parlava dell'Italia e del problema di una eventuale svalutazione, quindi possiamo considerarlo analogo a quello Argentino visto che credo tu sottintenda che la debolezza del Pesos potrebbe essere un problema.

&gt; Considerazione interessante, ma mi permetto di obiettare: il costo delle materie prime è spesso ridotto rispetto al valore aggiunto introdotto dal processo di lavorazione. Quindi potresti tranquillamento compensare l'aumento dei costi delle materie prime riducendo la pressione fiscale, il costo del lavoro, potenziando le infrastrutture, ecc. Questo produce ricchezza che magicamente farebbe lievitare il valore nominale della valuta, riducendo l'effetto inflattivo.

Nel mondo piddino-montiamo è un *piacere* parlare con una persona che capisca la differenza che c'è tra ricchezza e moneta (che è più o meno la stessa che c'è tra la lunghezza di una strada e i metri che servono per misurarla). In una corrispondenza epistolare con un mio amico/collega che fa il ricercatore in ambito di matematica finanziaria si parlava del problema della svalutazione derivante da inflazione. C'è uscito questo passaggio:  
  
&gt; Considerazione interessante, ma mi permetto di obiettare: il costo delle materie prime è spesso ridotto rispetto al valore aggiunto introdotto dal processo di lavorazione. Quindi potresti tranquillamento compensare l'aumento dei costi delle materie prime riducendo la pressione fiscale, il costo del lavoro, potenziando le infrastrutture, ecc. Questo produce ricchezza che magicamente farebbe lievitare il valore nominale della valuta, riducendo l'effetto inflattivo.  
  
quindi il problema non è tanto nello stampare moneta ma in *come* questa moneta viene utilizzata. Riguardo all'Argentina, ti invito a notare come la spesa pubblica sia passata da una connotazione *tattica* del primo mandato presidenziale di Cristina (assistenzialismo a go-go) a una connotazione *strategica*: infrastrutture (migliaia di km di ferrovie), ricerca (piano di rientro di ricercatori all'estero), energia (8 reattori nucleari), edilizia residenziale. Quindi la Yamaha sposta la produzione delle moto in Argentina e Facebook apre una sede a Buenos Aires. E tante altre cose. 
E arriviamo ai mofo-bund. Furono una invenzione della Germania Nazista (!!) per ridare impulso all'economia. Una specie di bit-coin. In pratica venivano stampati questi pezzi di carta che fungevano da valuta alternativa. In sintesi: la valuta è un bene convenzionale/nominale ma deve circolare.  
  
P.S. hai ragione, mofo-bund non da risultati su google. Vuoi vedere che mi ricordo male il nome? Ah, 'sto tedesco non lo imparerò mai...

It's just that, after New Castile was amputated Madrid and gained Albacete, it wasn't felt that the resulting region could keep the same name, and Castilla - La Mancha had a nice Quixotic ring to it.

The main difference between Old and New Castile is indeed the time in which they were conquered, but this had long-lasting cultural and economic effects: as the Reconquista progressed, the ""encomienda"" system was perfected by which the king granted ""oversight"" over the land *and* people living thereon to the knights who had taken part in the conquest. As a result, in the whole of Spain you will notice that landholdings become ever larger as you travel south, whereas social inequality increases. The ""encomienda"" system, in its ""finished"" form was later exported to Latin America (with still very visible social and economic effects).

Consequently, in Old Castile land ownership was more widespread than in New Castile, making the population at large more conservative, since they were more likely to own their own land, or at least not depend of an absentee landlord, something much more common in New Castile, or even more strikingly, Andalusia and Estremadura.

Così come i palestinesi (un popolo che è cresciuto in 50 anni da 700.000 a 4.000.000, per inciso) hanno reazioni scomposte a causa delle reazioni scomposte israeliane, il sentimento israeliano di rivalsa imediata nasce anche dal fatto di essere circondato da paesi nemici, che vorrebbero vedere la distruzione di israele in un microsecondo.

(ignorando poi le vere ""caste"" come notai, tassisti, farmacisti... boh), di quelli contro i GMO... sembrano votare cinque stelle. Poi ovviamente c'è gente uguale che vota PD, PDL, SEL e tutti gli altri, non ho dubbi, ma la percentuale mi sembra maggiore.

* I parlamentari. Sono perfettamente d'accordo col portare ""carne fresca"" in parlamento, ma non ignoranti. Secondo me il ""non essere politici di professione"" non dovrebbe essere assolutamente un vanto. Ancora, so che sto facendo di nuovo di tutta l'erba un fascio, e ci sono dei perfetti deficienti in tutti i partiti, ma i 5 stelle sono quelli che volevano bandire il grano saraceno, che hanno augurato morte a napolitano...

* La linea politica. Un conto è volere cambiare le cose, un conto è sedersi incrociando le braccia come alle elementari e continuare a ripetere ""NO"". Purtroppo o per fortuna, la politica è fatta di compromessi, e non facendone nessuno blocchi solo il paese perché non si crea nessuna maggioranza, e quindi non viene approvato niente.

* La linea politica (2). Semplicemente non mi trovo d'accordo con alcune delle loro proposte, come l'uscire dall'EU (facile dare la colpa di tutto all'euro, eh?), il reddito di cittadinanza, lo stop dei finanziamenti ai partiti (che vadano diminuiti sono anche d'accordo, ma cosi rischi solo di consegnarli nelle mani dei privati).

* Grillo. Davvero, potrei perdonare qualsiasi cosa ai 5 stelle se non fosse per lui. Fa il capo ma non ha il coraggio di giocarsi le palle (facile stare fuori e buttare via chiunque non abbia la tua opinione), e andare ad urlare vaffanculo in piazza non è il modo di fare politica. Mi sembra una specie di Mussolini venuto male ogni tanto. Non risco proprio a sopportarlo.

* Casaleggio. Boh, non ho una grande opinione di lui, so solo che mi sta molto sui coglioni per come si guadagna da vivere (clickbait su clickbait).

Detto questo, alternative? No, non ne ho. Ma so che preferirei non votare nessuno piuttosto che dare il mio voto a loro, per i motivi sopra. Io nel frattempo voto PD, per il semplice fatto che ogni voto in più è un voto verso la loro maggioranza, e quindi magari verso la loro possibilità di fare qualche cambiamento (ed inoltre quel poco che han fatto fino ad ora non mi sembra uno schifo completo, quindi magari sono sulla buona strada).

Furthermore the president itself ran on an early  parliamentary elections platform and as committed himself to hold them this year still, and since the beginning about 70 percent of the population were for early elections. 

So of course elections now are  problematic. But the lesser of two evils.

Elle pose aussi des questions trop mignonnes, du style ""Au Japon, on décide d'abord de se mettre en couple et ensuite on couche ensemble. Il paraît qu'en France, on couche d'abord et ensuite on décide de se mettre en relation. C'est vrai ? Et est-ce que tu es comme ça toi aussi ?"".

And that's probably another problem in Europe. Starting a company, especially a tech company with some yet-to-be-proven-to-be-useful new product is a high risk operation. If you are the founder or an employee, that should be on your mind.

If you find out that your new product is not viable and or there is no real market for it, the very best way is to dump it as soon as possible.

The Tierheim is mostly about rehoming cats, but that can work well. If the staff there are good, they'll be able to find a good match for you: obviously, some of the cats there might have health problems or be traumatized in some way, and need an owner with the right sort of experience. You should probably avoid telling people, especially at the Tierheim, that you specifically want a kitten to love, because that will just make them wonder what you're going to do when it grows up. If you're American, that will work against you because Americans have a reputation among Germans for abandoning pets. It's probably an undeserved reputation, but you need to know that this reputation exists.

* sono arroganti e maleducati. Guardati i video tipo ""Tizio del M5S distrugge gli avversari in parlamento"", 90% sono stupidi arrabbiati che si coprono di ridicolo e mancano di rispetto alla gente.

* presentano un pensiero antiscientifico preoccupante. Questo per me e' il punto peggiore. Lo scienziato ormai e' additato come il ""professorone"" che fa il saputello e prende un sacco di soldi, invece che esperto in materia. Stiamo assistendo alla crescita esponenziale di complottismi e cazzate antiscientifiche, l'ultima roba che serve e' gente che propini queste idee dal governo.

* sono ignoranti. Vedi punto precedente. Non sanno come funzionano le cose che sono chiamati a votare.. [Vedi qui](http://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/2c9m7w/la_situazione_politica_attuale_secondo_un/). Non hanno qualifiche in economia, politica, storia, o qualsiasi altra cosa abbia un minimo di attinenza col governare un paese.

* non sono collaborativi. Basti vedere l'ostruzionismo che stanno facendo al parlamento per proposte che, quando le lanciava grillo, accettavano ciecamente

* grillo: personaggio davvero infimo. Non vuole fare il capo pero' comanda. Predica parlamento pulito e lui ha decine di condanne. Sbandiera democrazia e caccia chi non la pensa come lui. Critica i politici ricchi e ha decine di appartamenti, barche etc. Esige la trasparenza in tutto, e non pubblica i proventi del blog.

* non hanno soluzioni vere. Le loro sono ""soluzioni semplici"" a problemi che non hanno soluzioni semplici.

* non scendono nel dettaglio. ""Destra e sinistra sono tutte uguali"" si certo, se non ti prendi la briga di andarti a leggere i manifesti. Poi quando anche le leggi vengono fatte con questo livello di superficialità, siamo a posto

* tende al fascismo. Si parla di processi popolari,

true,Naurgul,null,null,"It's a bit more complicated than ""inflation phobia"", actually. Germany is so used to being an exporting country that they have difficulty understanding the problems arising if they ask everyone to do the same as them. 

To expand on that thought: 

&gt; In 1873, there was a huge stock market bubble in Germany, and it blew up. It was called the Founders Crisis. And liberal economic ideas of the type we've been discussing
were completely discredited.

&gt; At this point in time, there was a guy called Liszt who comes along and says, you know, the funny thing about the Brits telling us all the story about how to get rich, if they had actually done that themselves-- you know what their comparative advantage was in? Wool. They would still be making blankets for the people in Flanders.

&gt; How come they're running the world? How come they have the biggest navy in the world? How come they make steel when they basically have no iron ore? What the hell is that all about? So he rewrote how you think about international trade. 

&gt; And at the same time that he did this, he, and also the Bismarck who was running the place did what was called the marriage or iron and rye, bringing together the industrialists in the south, the agrarians in the north. You use the surplus from agriculture to basically buy flattened equipment. You bring it in, you reverse engineer it, you do it faster, you do it faster, you build up German industrial capitalism. Big firms, big banks, forced saving, a big role for the state.

&gt; And it's all driven by exports. There's your difference. But when you're exporting and your sources of demand lie outside your economy, you don't have to worry about
internal demand. The Keynesian story makes no sense if you're Germany. Why would you want to stabilize consumption if you're export dependent? Because all you're going to do is raise your wages and prices, and your BMW is going to go from 50,000 to 100,000 real fast, and you're not going to sell them. So if you don't rely on domestic consumption and rely on external consumption, the dynamics of your economy are completely different.

&gt; What do you care about price control? All this stuff about the neuralgia of the 1920s and the inflation experience, this is a post-war construction. It's really about remaining price competitive in export markets.

&gt; So you need a strong, independent central bank. What else do you care about? Very important: competition. You want to have competition over products, so that you have BMW and Audi competing with each other so they can sell more to the Chinese both because they're competing against product quality. You don't get involved in the Apple, Samsung, buy up patents and sue each other in court crap. You do real competition to get real value out at the end of it.

&gt; Given that the role of the state, these Freiburg liberals-- this is Walter Euken, one of the guys who, post-war, reinvigorates all this stuff. Because after Nazism is is credited, they needed a new thing. And basically it was about the economic constitution, where
competition rather than consumption becomes important, and sound money and central bank independence defines the economy.

&gt; Why is this important? First of all, for 30 years, this is the entire structure of the Euro. If you think about the way the European Union is set up, it's Generalized Ordoliberalism, to give that type of liberalism its name.

Sinceramente non mi è mai interessato del meteo, la trovo una mania noiosa ed inutile se non quando ci sono interessi specifici (vacanze\gente che lavora con particolari condizioni atmosferiche\pendolari hardcore) perché tanto a me il tempo interessa solo a pasquetta e sappiamo benissimo tutti che a pasquetta piove. 

Però non posso che stare dalla parte dei giusti, perché vedere terroristi (il termine è che azzeccato) approfittare di calamità naturali che hanno portato in passato a disastri e morti è una cosa disgustosa. 

Allo stesso modo critico l'approccio ""casalingo"", con le perturbazioni dai nomi di donna, i click bait, etc.

Quindi non mi interessa il meteo, trovo la perversione meteorologica dei TG (agosto: ""TADA, ANCORA CALDO TORRIDO!"", dicembre: ""TADA, PIOVE ED IL FREDDO CONTINUERÀ ANCHE A GENNAIO"", aprile: ""TADA, DOVE SONO LE MEZZE STAGIONI?"") imbarazzante e sintomo di cattivo giornalismo, ma non posso che appoggiare totalmente persone competenti che cercano di fare il loro lavoro nel migliore dei modi.

&gt;Regarding the High Representative - which is basically European Foreign Minister - Romania rallied to the position of the Eastern Europeans who want to get to a representative therea. [...] ""We would like the High Representative for Foreign Policy to be a representative of the Eastern countries"" - said President Traian Basescu, at departure to Brussels.

&gt;The European press has indicated that variants for this position on the Bulgarian Kristlina Georgieva and Polish Radoslaw Sikorski, of the Eastern Bloc and the Italian Federica Mogherini in the western part of the EU.

&gt;And here comes a divergence between PM Ponta and President Basescu, regarding Romania's position, something that could weaken the bargaining position of the country. If Basescu already expressed his option for a representative of the Eastern countries, Ponta shoots for Italian Mogherini, social democratic sources said for HotNews.ro.

&gt;Georgieva is supported by the Bulgarian opposition - GERB party of former Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, who is part of the European People's Party, that is a colleague of Traian Baescu in Europe. So is the Polish Radoslaw Sikorski, who is a member of Civic Platform, of Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk, a member of the EPP.

&gt;Ponta, however, supports colleague and friend Matteo Renzi, Premier of Rome and the Italian Democratic Party, which wants the post of EU foreign minister for Mogherini.

&gt;Also, things are tangled Sofia to the Bulgarian Socialist Party leader Sergey Stanishev says he does not support Kristalina Georgieva, given that he himself targets a commissioner post. Stanishev is president of the Party of European Socialists and a friend Victor Ponta - hence another reason for social democratic Prime Minister not to agree with Basescu's pledge of support for Georgieva in the European Council.

&gt;Mogherini, which was in Bucharest in late May, encounters the opposition of Poland and the Baltic States, which reproach the Italian diplomat's proximity to Russia.

&gt;

&gt;The ___Übermensch___ ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language) for ""Overman, Overhuman, Above-Human, Superman, Super-human""; German pronunciation: [ˈˀyːbɐmɛnʃ]) is a [concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept) in the [philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_Friedrich_Nietzsche). [Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) had his character Zarathustra posit the Übermensch as a goal for humanity to set for itself in his 1883 book *[Thus Spoke Zarathustra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thus_Spoke_Zarathustra)* ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language): *Also Sprach Zarathustra*), although Nietzsche clearly disagreed with many things he had Zarathustra say.

&gt;There is no consensus regarding the precise meaning of the *Übermensch*, nor on the importance of the concept in Nietzsche's thought. There are other conceptions of [superhuman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhuman) nature besides those that are labeled Übermensch.

true,trycatch1,RUSS,Russia,"&gt; Well the BBC, Reuters, Guardian, Independent, Times, ITV etc all are reporting on the Ukraine situation and have reporters on the ground 

I opened the BBC site, the top report on Ukraine is this thingie: [Ukraine MH17: Rebels ambush army convoy near crash site](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28599315). Reported by Tom Burridge from Kyiv. Nobody would argue that he reported it ""from the ground"", however, this ground was more than 600km far away from the events he reported about. The ambushed convoy was ~20km from Grabovo, maybe from Kyiv it looks ""near crash site"", but for the conflict it's not ""near"" at all. Then he retold official statements of ATO Press Center and official twitter of DNR. Then a video fragment showing how an OSCE observer is returning to his car from a toilet, tucking his pants, few more videos of OSCE observers and UA military moving around. This report is over.

Then there is a report by a guy who actually visited Shakhtarsk -- that's good, however, his visit was absolutely useless -- few sentimental interviews with crying civilians, that's all you can get from it. He didn't say in a single word e.g. why Shakhtarsk is so strategically important for both UA army and ""rebels"". Not a single word that ""rebels"" also have strong artillery in Shakhtarsk (including 120mm mortars, tanks, self-propelling 122m howitzers ""Gvozdika"", Grads, etc.), and that they happily shell the city with all this stuff. In the end he makes the following abstruse statement: ""Ukrainian forces are seems to be determined to retake the territory controlled by rebels, but no sign yet that they can unite the nation"" -- dude, maybe you should visit Sloviansk or Kramatorsk to get such a sign? Or read the latest survey showing that the Ukrainian nation is more united than ever? The report is over.

That's basically is an example of very poor superficial reporting and non-existing analysis you are able to get only a very vague and distorted idea what's going on in the area.

&gt;  I can't recall a time where any of the newspapers/outlets have published a story which was complete bullshit with zero evidence or factual backing. 

What about secret Putin-Merkel pact invented by The Independent? They surely double checked this stuff.

The primaries of the PSOE were won by Pedro Sanchez the conservative candidate.  He was the only candidate that supported the current economic policies and that from opposition. They had also a Eduardo Madina, social-liberal candidate; he was the favourite, his wife was *hired* by Telefonica for the same type of position that Rajoy's wife had. Pedro Sanchez was involved in the fall of Caja Madrid, as part of the assembly. The only candidate without known dirty stuff was the independent left candidadate Jose Antonio Perez Tapias.

Both big parties are too conservative to change. The PSOE turned to the right a month after the best results of the parties to its left.

I am using conservative as opposed to change. I mean the tobacco distribution is done with a system of a private monopoly for every postal code, both big parties support it. It was established by Franco. It doesn't fit with liberal or socialist policies, but it's a strong lobby. One of the errors of Madina was defending the liberalization of things like that.

How can I put this? In English, it used to be that you could use ""man"" to refer to all humans -- and fairly recently at that. That's not the case with the German ""Mann"".

For example, while even a relatively modern English-language Bible can say, in Matthew 4:4 ""Man cannot live by bread alone..."", in the 1912 Lutherbibel the same phrase reads: ""Der Mensch lebt nicht vom Brot allein..."" Had the translation said, ""Der Mann lebt nicht..."", the question in the reader's mind would have been: ""Wait -- which man are we talking about? Who is he?"" The alternative, ""Man lebt nicht...""

This is simply a lie.

Your comment implies that I don't admit other countries get aid from the West and that I think Israel is worse than its neighbors, because it fits your argument. But I never spoke about Israel's neighbors. 

It's pretty simple, Israel isn't any better than its neighbors. 

And Israel isn't more criticized than its neighbors. It's criticized in a different light, and the reason is also pretty simple. Israel claims to be a democracy, the West claims Israel is a democracy. People judge Israel on the standards of a democracy.

You can bet that if Saudi Arabia started bombing its neighbors in the name of democracy and claiming their land, etc., people would criticize them just the same as people criticize Israel.

And you can bet that the West (USA especially) would jump in the Saudis defense claiming they were indeed a democracy fighting for self-determination, bla-bla-bla.

I perfectly agree that the West aids many Middle-Eastern countries, and they do so for very different reasons. But to claim Israel is less dependent of this aid is simply a lie. They're all equally dependent. They're all leeches of the West. Israel isn't any better than its neighbors.

&gt;  
&gt; Impfungen sind ein massiver Eingriff in die Gesundheit des Menschen, die ihm eher schaden als helfen. Wenn sie aber schädlich waren und man damit zum Arzt geht, wird nur behaupet: Ne das kommt da und da her. Ganz besonderer Quatsch ist die Tetanusimfung. Bei der heutigen Hygiene ist es kaum möglich Tetanus zu bekommen. Man müsste eine Wunde erstmal nicht säubern, dann luftdicht abschliessen und ca 3 Tage warten. Dann bekommt man vieleicht Tetanus.
&gt; 
&gt; Danke für dieses Video Martin, ganz besonders die Stelle 4:45. Hör ich ganz oft von anderen Eltern. Euer ungeimpftes Kind steckt unsere geimpften Kinder an ... HÄ? ^^
&gt; 
&gt; Hab auch schon vor längerer Zeit ein Video zu dem Thema gemacht und es wurde ziemlich stark kritisiert. In diesem Sinne, danke für dein Engagement (und Mut^^) auf dieses Thema nochmal aufmerksam zu machen. :)

Dann eine Antwort die ein paar gute Argumente bringt:

&gt;  
&gt; Ich finde Deine Videos klasse und sehr inspirierend. Deswegen finde ich es schade, dass Du dieser Meinung bist. Ich denke, Pocken, Mumps, Masern, Röteln und Polio sind weitaus schädlicher als die Impfungen. Es gibt keine Nachweise, dass Impfungen schädlich für den Einzelnen sind. Durch Impfungen soll vielmehr eine Herdenimmunität in der Population hergestellt werden, die bei den o.g. Krankheiten verhindern soll, dass es zu einer flächendeckenden Ausbreitung mit vielen Betroffenen kommt. Bis vor 100 Jahren waren nämlich solche Krankheitsausbrüche mit Toten oder Geschädigten üblich. Und um dem Argument zuvor zu kommen, dass es in unserer Industrienation nicht zu solchen Ausbrüchen kommen könne, verweise ich auf die Ausbrüche in Bayern, NRW und der Schweiz in den letzten 10 Jahren. Dort gab es aufgrund lokaler Impfmüdigkeit zu erheblichen Masernausbrüchen auch mit Toten. Und wenn ich dann Fälle sehe, in denen noch nicht durch eine Impfung zu schützende Säuglinge durch eine Masernübertragung nicht geimpfter anderer Kinder, schwerst geistig und körperlich behindert werden, kann ich Deiner Ansicht nicht folgen und halte sie für sehr problematisch. Solche Schäden durch Impfmüdigkeit würden nicht eintreten, würde mehr gegen die Masern geimpft. Denn dann hätte das Virus keine Chance mehr (ähnlich wie bei den Pocken). Doch leider scheint der größte Feind der Impfung, sein Erfolg zu sein. Wo die Menschen die Auswirkung von solchen Krankheitsausbrüchen nicht mehr mitbekommen, wird sich dann eben die Frage der Notwendigkeig gestellt.

Die Rückantwort:

&gt;  
&gt; +Schena123
&gt; Leider gibt es keinen Beweis dass Impfungen wirken. Dafür müsste es eine große Doppelblindstudie geben und die gibt es nicht. Allein der Titer soll ausschlaggebend für eine Immunität sein, doch selbst dann kann die Krankheit noch ausbrechen.
&gt; Und das es vor 100 Jahren noch solche Krankheitsausbrüche gab kann viele Ursachen haben. Immerhin wurde seitdem nich nur die Impfung eingeführt.
&gt; Komischerweise hat jede, von einer Impfstoffherstellerfirma finanzierten, Studie zu dem Thema ein positives Ergebniss und jede freifinanzierte ein negatives. Ist bei der Wirkung von Milch genauso, aber da merken langsam einige das das Quatsch ist. Wird bei Impfstoffen auch irgendwann der Fall sein.
&gt; Allein schon wenn man sie anschaut wie Impfungen getestet werden. (Polio zb) Ein Affe bekommt einen scheinbaren Erreger aus dem Rückmark von einem scheinbar an Polio verstorbenen Jungen ins Gehirn gespritzt. Natürlich wurde das vorher gereinigt, was bedeutet das jede Menge Chemikalien drin waren. Wenn der Affe starb war das der Beweis das Polio übertragbar und tödlich ist. Mal ehrlich wer Chemikalien ind Gehirn gespritzt bekommt, bei dem wundere ich mich nicht wenn der stirbt. Der ganze natürliche Prozess der Ansteckung kann so gar nicht nachvollzogen werden. Natürlich ging das Experiment noch weiter mit tausenden von Affen. Will jetzt hier nicht alles hinschreiben^^
&gt; Fakt ist dass ich mich sehr eingehend mit dem Thema beschäftigt habe und immer noch beschäftige, da ich wahrscheinlich erst einen Bruchteil von allem weiß. Darum habe ich meine Meinung^^ die habe ich ja nicht einfach so brauchst du also nicht schade finden ;)
&gt; 
&gt; Übrigens zum Thema Imunität noch mal einen kurzen Gedankengang.
&gt; Impfungen bestehen, wie schon gesagt aus abgeschwächten veränderten Erregern, die dann Immunität erzeugen sollen. Wenn man alle Giftstoffe in der Spritze mal aussen vor lässt. Wogegen ist man dann Immun? Gegen den Erreger oder gegen den abgeschwächten veränderten Erreger? ;) Darum gibts auch Kinder die an ihren geimpften Krankheiten erkranken.

Jetzt konnte ich mich nicht mehr zurückhalten...

&gt;  
&gt; +Koch's vegan  Faszinierend. Hast du zufälligerweise eine Quelle zu der Geschichte mit den Affen? Würde mich tatsächlich interessieren.
&gt; 
&gt; Man sollte, ganz richtig wie du gesagt hast, bedenken, dass Studien oft ""zufällig"" zu einem Ergebnis kommen, welches die Studierende Partei gerne hören möchte. Allerdings ist bei den freien Studien gut möglich, dass sie mit dem Hintergedanken gemacht werden, zu einem anderen Ergebnis zu kommen als die vorherigen von Konzernen finanzierten. Mit anderen Worten: Genau so ""zufällig"" wie bei den einen Impfungen immer toll zu funktionieren scheinen, so ""zufällig tun sie dies bei den Anderen eben nicht.
&gt; (nur meine Meinung...)
&gt; 
&gt; Und schließlich zu der Funktionsweise von Impfstoffen:
&gt; Genau genommen gibt es zwei Arten von Impfungen: Die Aktive und die Passive. NUR bei der Aktiven Impfung werden abgetötete oder geschwächte Krankheitserreger injiziert. Bei der Passiven Impfung werden konzentrierte Antikörper verabreicht... keine Sorge, Antikörper sind harmlos, sind bloß Proteine. Zugegeben, die Passive Impfung ist eine Notimpfung und hält nicht so lange vor wie die Aktive, aber man sollte um ihrer Existenz bescheid wissen.
&gt; Bei der Aktiven Impfung werden aber auch nicht immer lebende abgeschwächte sondern auch oft tote Bruchstücke der unveränderten Krankheitszellen verwendet. Da Antikörper sich an segmente der Erreger heften müssen reichen diese für gewöhnlich auch.
&gt; 
&gt; Letztlich noch deine Frage, ob man bei einer Impfung gegen den vorbereiteten Erreger, davon ausgegangen dass es ein Abgeschwächter ist, oder gegen einen natürlichen Erreger immunisiert wird:
&gt; Impfstoffe werden lange erprobt (unter anderem an Tieren, ja) damit sie dem Menschen nicht schaden können, im Gegenteil, ihm helfen. Und wenn man davon ausgeht, dass die grundlegende Struktur der abgeschwächten Erreger erhalten bleibt (wozu die Versuche ja da sind) besteht kein Risiko und die gebildeten Antikörper funktionieren auch gegen die echten Erreger (wiederum: Dafür sind die Versuche da).
&gt; 
&gt; Und zum Schluss noch die Erzählung aus dem Video, dass die jährliche Impfung gegen Grippe vergebens war: Grippe ist ein ziemlich fieses Zeug, gegen das die Menschen ja nun schon länger vorgehen. Anders als viele andere Erreger verändern sich Grippe Viren sehr schnell. D.h. dass der Betroffene einfach eine leicht andere Grippe gekriegt hat als jene, gegen die er impfte. Aus meiner Sicht ist der Nutzen einer Grippeimpfung tatsächlich eben aus diesem Grund fragwürdig, was aber NICHT heißt, dass alle Impfungen nutzlos sind. Schließlich gibt es auch weniger wandelbare Erreger, die mit Impfungen effektiv bekämpft werden können.
&gt; 
&gt; Soo, ich will mal mit gutem Beispiel vorran gehen und Quellen zu meinem Geschwafel angeben:

Ora stiamo entrando in un discorso veramente lungo e profondo: non credo che la democrazia funzioni, a dirla tutta sono anarchico e credo nell'anarchia. Eppure voto.

Voto perché se la democrazia necessita di una solida base di istruzione e civiltà, l'anarchia ne è fortemente dipendente e la sua esistenza è impossibile senza quei prerequisiti (a meno che per anarchia non intendiamo ""Ehhhh ognuno fa quello che vuole, andiamo a saccheggiare qualche negozio, bum bum crashhh"").

Io posso dire che per quanto non sia un sostenitore del sistema democratico faccio il mio dovere cercando di scorgere rappresentanti del popolo che credo possano fare del bene all'Italia. 

Magari sbaglio, non posso vedere se Caio ha veramente un cuore puro come dice, ma se lo faccio ti assicuro che è in buonissima fede.

Praticamente dietro ad ogni rovesciamento dinastico o politico c'e' di mezzo un complotto o piu' genericamente una rete di inganni. Poi non voglio parlare dei debunker, perche' nella vita comune non ho con me sempre un debunker tascabile da sfoderare ogni volta che ho un dubbio, per cui si rimane esposti ad interpretazioni, il che forse non e' neanche del tutto un male. Pero' ad esempio, prendiamo il crack finanziario del 2008. A raccontarlo al momento non era molto diverso dalle tesi folli sul Bilderberg o sul signoraggio, che sono semplicemente idiozie. Pero' e' prova provata che all' epoca un pugno di finanzieri senza scrupoli in concerto coscientemente ha ignorato (consapevolemnte) il rischio negli investimenti (ad essere gentili) e il risultato e' stato la maggiore crisi finanziaria dal dopoguerra. Allo stesso tempo, inspiegabilmente sia le banche centrali che vari enti di controllo che in altre situazione avrebbero potuto tranquillamente tamponare la situazione per tempo, non hanno controllato nulla ed hanno sottovalutato la situazione lasciando che questo episodio degenerasse in un bubbone putrescente i cui effetti sentiamo ancora nel 2014.
Questo episodio ha tutte le caratteristiche di una cospirazione cazzata (irrazionalita', le banche cattive, corrotti a tutti i livelli, avidita', etc), eppure ... Se mettiamo ad esempio nel 2007 tu (generico tu) avessi cominciato a denunciare la situazione, probabilmente ti avrebbero riso in faccia. Come vedi la linea di confine tra cazzata e realta' puo' essere davvero labile alle volte. Ma di esempi di cospirazioni reali ma completamente folli se ne possono fare a milioni, da IRAN - CONTRAS a Watergate fino al complotto nazista per l' eliminazione degli ebrei. Non sono episodi degni delle fantasie piu' sfrenate di un complottista da rinchiudere in manicomio e gettare via la chiave? Eppure sono realta'.

&gt;Fact is, a lot of people are worried about the growing numbers of muslims in the UK whose population has doubled every ten years since the 1950's and now comprise 12.5% of London's population. Islam is a backwards stone-age cult whose members believe in a divine mandate that homosexuals should be murdered so anyone with intelligent progressive values should be concerned about its rise in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. That is a perfectly legitimate and non-racist position to have. It's fine living in a country where compatible cultures co-exist. It's when the cultures are not compatible, problems arise.

Or

&gt;Muslim immigrants are Labour's toys to play with. The reason they vote Labour is not because Labour has strong anti-homosexual, misogynist and conservative values in line with their beliefs. They vote Labour because Labour brought them here and offer them free money in return for their vote. They are Labour's toys to play with. The problem is, they got a taste for it and started voting for someone who offered them even more free money and spoke their language. This is naturally a big problem for Labour as their other toys, the working class, are deserting them too. They don't want to be in a position where the only people left voting for them are the welfare class and a few right-on, rabid, feminist Guardian journalists.

Or

&gt;yeah, he's saying contrary to what some bleeding brain imbeciles like to pretend among the ""liberal"" intelligencia, normal, ""non-extreme"", common-or-garden muslims actually do believe in barbaric punishments against homosexuals, adulterers or apostates to cite a few examples.

You do this because you are motivated by more demanding tasks and/or to get a comfier job, better health and a longer life expectancy.

&gt;Another person quits after middle school, doesn't work or works very easy jobs and, in general, contributes considerably less to the economy.

Menial jobs are seldom easy, health prospects are lower and life expectancy shorter. Also, they work all the time paying taxes while you study. By the time you enter the workforce, they have already paid a handsome sum in upkeep while all you have at that point is *potential* to contribute.

It's a fairly redundant point of view anyhow. The important thing is to keeping the overall society rolling. Low- to low-middle income households spend more of their income than high earning households, who tend to save part of their money - thus contributing very little to society. If you punish low income households by taxing them too much they don't consume. If they don't consume, company profits drop, leading to jobs being cut, leading to less people earning, less people consuming, starting a vicious cycle.

Basically we want an overall high consumption or else it will start to suck for the vast majority of people.

A progressive tax is equal, everybody has the best prospects to consume - especially the households that tend to consume the most. A flat rate gives a high earner more money to save, but that isn't favorable for society as a whole.

&gt; 
&gt; Ma io non lo credo, credo semplicemente che tu sia – banalmente, per quello che ti ho letto – una persona cattiva, e che frequenti troppe persone capaci di fare quello di cui mi accusi. Ma se tu sei abituata a essere bugiarda, non misurare me con il tuo metro. Non tutti sono come te.

&gt; http://www.distantisaluti.com/i-meno-meno-meno-peggio/
&gt; E decido di scriverlo dopo una discussione su Friendfeed, social network che frequenti e su cui ci siamo scornati diverse volte, in cui mi ero reso conto di quante persone fossero ignare della falsità di quelle mappe:

&gt; Avessi letto il post di Sullivan (o gli altri), l’avrei citato, come ho sempre fatto quando accade. Chiunque conosca il rigore con cui scrivo, non avrebbe alcun dubbio.
&gt; 
&gt; Ed è naturalmente vero che quelle quattro mappe fossero attaccate, nel centro in cui lavoravo, già dal 2008 (la prima guerra a Gaza è di fine 2008, non del 2006: se cerchi di accreditarti come storica, non dovresti fare questo sfondone storico pazzesco http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_War), come ovviamente ridicolo insinuare che io non abbia lavorato in Palestina: ci sono centinaia di post, foto, racconti, testimonianze. Questo, per esempio, è quello che scrissi il giorno che scoppiò la prima guerra a Gaza: http://www.distantisaluti.com/domenica-28-dicembre/
&gt; 
&gt; Te lo posto per farti vedere, per esempio, che io ero contrario a quella guerra, come sono contrario a questa. Ma che ci sono persone che non adottano il tuo modo binario di vedere le cose – se dico questa cosa a chi fa gioco? – ma pensano che le proprie battaglie sono buone battaglie solo se si combattono con onestà.

It should go without saying that the money you earn does not come out of a black box with 2 slots on it: ""Input: work"" - ""Output: Money"".

Instead, the black box is the rest of society, and if the majority of society is struggling to pay the bills, then also the majoriy of the high earners will strugle to keep their jobs/better life, as all the money then flows towards the select few providing bare necessities.

Furthermore, you forget that **investing is really not a duty, it is a luxury**. To invest, you need to have substantial amounts of money left at the end of the month. Otherwise, the only way you can invest is to take care of other people in simple non-financial ways that are *not rewarded*. So, I do not see why you hold everyone up to an unobtainable standard to invest. Only those who already earn enough can *decide* to invest, others cannot, hence it is a luxury. Nothing but a way to make you feel good when you already have enough.

Contribution is also way overblown. There are plenty people doing actual labour for way less pay than you, who are functioning at a level that is just right for them. Many others can't find a job. They would also like your black box that magically gives more money to you as long as you put in ""hard work"".

Yes, those who drop out after middle school are paying taxes for the next 8 years while I get my higher education. But I will be paying, even with flat taxes, a marginally larger amount in total after graduating, possibly for the next 30 - 40 years. Proportionally, I really can't see how the poorer worker contributed more.  

The thing with higher-income households is that they have more income to spend. Yes, a poorer family may spend 100% of his net income, let's say, 600 euros a month. The richer family, however, even when spending 50% of their net income, could spend 3000 euros a month. Even when spending a smaller percentage, the household with a higher income spends considerably more than one that earns less.  

Every low-income household has the opportunity to try and at least not be poor. If you are not willing to put in the effort to improve your own life and help yourself, why should others do it for you?

altro atteggiamento che li rende estremamente ridicoli è quello di vedere complotti del pd ad ogni angolo: perdono le elezioni? complotto del pd. le votazioni online (non certificat da nessuno) sul loro finto portale (costituito di click-bait) non vanno come previsto? si inventano gli ""hacker del pd"".

Putin's words say nothing about imperialism. I applaud any nation who protects their minorities or other minorities when they are at risk of being treated unjustly. To take such a quote and deduce a form of imperialism behind it is kindergarden propaganda.

And no, in Crimea this was not the case which is why I denounced the annexation from the very beginning and I still do. 

&gt;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26637296

Using such an incident to claim that the Russian army is in fact engaging the Ukrainian army in Crimea or even the East is irrational and desperate. 

You and most people are not interested in understanding what's happening, but you're looking for ""evidence"" or ""incriminating information"". The reason for this is the assumption, fed to us by most of the media, that every obstacle that the new Ukrainian government encounters has to be the responsibility of Russia. A priori, if you will. It's very similar to the sort of conspiracy style of thought used by certain groups who believe everything wrong with the world is the fault of the Jews. (The style, not the motives)

If someone would actually try to understand instead of incriminate, he would firstly consider the following question: If the Russian Army controls these separatists and has an interest in this region, then why are they losing against the Ukrainian Army? Secret operation or not, the Ukrainian army is a dilapidated sinkhole of corruption that stagnated in the early nineties. One might even consider whether the Ukrainian Army themselves believe that the Russian troops are present on the battlefield. Because if they did knew this, it's actually quite surprising that they engaged them, because they refrained from doing this in Crimea. But that's a hypothetical, which we do not believe without evidence.

If someone who tries to understand what's happening is looking for useable facts, he's not going to pretend some instagram picture of a soldier is some kind of great discovery. He will however ask himself why Russia is sending one third of a BUK system and a trained crew to shoot down a civilian plane like some kind of idiot. Or why Russia is emptying a single GRAD from Russian soil while, according to the internet detectives, he could drive it 200 meters more Westwards and be in Ukrainian territory? What could possibly be the objective here?

He may however be more interested in what the rebel leaders are publicly saying and why it might be quite important that these rebels have attacked Putin openly for his inaction in Eastern Ukraine.

This person will also look for motives, because that's how geopolitics makes sense. Why is Putin sending a secret and highly unsuccesful mission to Eastern Ukraine when the West is apparantly 100% certain that they are behind it anyway? Including the great majority of the Western public. Why would Russia chose to loose, when the media war has already been lost?

Do you want to know why? Because they are not interested in obtaining this region and they are already thinking about a couple of years from now, when the independent investigations will have to admit they didn't found anything linking the separatists with Russia except medical supplies.

Mind you, I do not deny that Russia is willingly neglecting the smuggling and recruitment of new separatists. And I wont deny it when Russia is sending the green men in like they did in Crimea. But reason, motives and the relevant facts are lacking from this debate. Completely.

An exception were spies that spied on Western nations and organizations such as Rainer Rupp and Gabriele Gast, who were sentenced to twelve years and six years nine months, respectively.

Erich Mielke, the long-time head of the Stasi, was prosecuted after the Wende, not for his Stasi actions, but for a murder he committed in 1931.

Wolfgang Schwanitz, his second-in-command, was never prosecuted.

Markus Wolf, long-time head of the foreign intelligence department HVA, was sentenced to six years, but that verdict was deemed invalid by the constitutional court. He was later sentenced to two years on probation for other crimes.

Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski got suspended prison sentences.

Ob du dafür geeignet bist wird vorher eingehend gecheckt. Der Eingriff ist ziemlich schnell und schmerzlos, aber ne Stunde danach wird es ziemlich unangenehm.

Man wird in der Regel vormittags operiert, dann ist man KO und haut sich hin, wenn du aufstehst kannst du, sofern alles gut gelaufen ist, perfekt sehen.

Man hat noch ne Woche so'n Fremdkörpergefühl im Auge, als wenn man ein Sandkorn drin hat, aber das ist schnell vergessen. Dann zwei Monate ordentlich mit künstlicher Tränenflüssigkeit schmieren und fertig. Keine anstrengenden Arbeiten oder Sport für 6 Wochen (wenn ich mich recht erinnere).

Ich hatte auf beiden Augen -2 und ebenfalls Hornhautverkrümmung, aber bisher ist alles super. Ich habe mich für Femto entschieden weil der Schnitt auch gelasert wird, also keine Klingen, dafür ist es eben teuerer.

Ich weiß nicht ob ich es wieder machen würde. Es ist schon n ganzer Haufen Geld und im nachhinein stellt sich für mich heraus dass es eigentlich nur kosmetischen Nutzen hat. Es ist super ohne Brille, keine Frage, aber unbedingt notwendig war es eben nicht.

Ich hab übrigens noch draufgezahlt, um lebenslang Garantie auf Nachbesserungen zu haben (man kann die Prozedur wiederholen, kein Problem).

No translation is really ""better"" than another inherently (as long as it's by a proficient speakers). Different translations just have different goals i.e. to make it a direct cognate with etymologically connected words (when possible); to make it sound as natural or idiomatic as possible; to make it sound as lofty as possible; etc. Arguing that one is better than the other for anything but aesthetic reasons (i.e. inherently better) is not taken particularly seriously.

You can make arguments *why one translation is more aesthetically pleasing or contextually relevant to a certain audience* (e.g. *super human* might be a less relevant to younger people who primarily think of the superheros or mutants/x-men or whatever but not necessarily to older audiences). **Why it is inherently better is not something that linguists and translators dwell on or believe in.**",0,1406902162,null,0,1406914915,0,cjdyilq,t3_2cbth3,t1_cjdyilq,t1_cjdy5dn,null,1435015189,3,false,German,t5_2qq51,3

Ik erken de grenzen van mijn mogelijkheden. 
Ik zal mij open en toetsbaar opstellen, en ik ken mijn verantwoordelijkheid voor de samenleving. 
Ik zal de beschikbaarheid en toegankelijkheid van de gezondheidszorg bevorderen.

&gt;I / swear promise I as good as I can will exercise the service of my fellow man. Medicine 
I'll take care of the sick, promote health and alleviate suffering. 
I suggest the importance of the patient first and respectful attitudes. 
I will do no harm to the patient. 
I listen and will inform him well. 
I will keep secret what has been entrusted to me. 
I will promote the medical knowledge of myself and others. 
I recognize the limits of my abilities. 
I shall draw open and testable, and I know my responsibility to society. 
I will promote the availability and accessibility of health care. 
I do not abuse my medical knowledge, even under pressure. 
I will uphold the medical profession alive. 
I promise (So help me God.)

The verse 'do no harm' is of course not stated so literal that it prevents doctors from doing surgery or any other form of medicine where one would need to 'first cause harm to then cure'; it's harm in the bigger sense.

true,Elmorn,FINL,Finland,"I personally agree with you, to an extent. In an ideal world, everyone would start from the exact same situation, and only their efforts would determine how far they get.

However, there are many issues with this idea, and with your claims of investment vs. reward. 

Education, while free or close to it, is not the only thing that affects your life. It gives you opportunities, but it is only one small aspect of the overall picture. 

People get sick, they get pregnant, they have to move due to their family situations, they might be debilitated by an accident, or may be they are born with a condition that affects their ability to perform in life. They might be born to abusive parents, to drug-abusing parents, or anti-education parents, religious parents, I dont think I need to list all the possibilities here for you to get the point.

On top of that, genetics, friends and economic situations around the world ALL have an effect on your lifetime earnings. Not to mention things like inheritance, if your family is rich, the connections and networking that that enables you to have. Also, your parents are more likely to be well educated too, which also affects how not only you develop, but how you view education in general. 

In a vacuum, it would be ""fair"" to tax everyone at the same rate, if everyone had the same opportunities in life, and the outcome of their life would only be dependent on their own actions.

This, however, is completely impossible. There is no way for such a society to exist, at least not yet. Maybe if we are all brought up from childhood by robots in the future, it might be possible, but would we even want such a society, only to tax people the same?

Anyways, my view  on the issue is that we all agree to participate in society, in the social contract that forms nations. To me, higher taxes have nothing to do with what I want to do with my life. Money, as an end, is meaningless. If you look at practically any studies concerning happiness, the top tends to be full of socialist high tax countries. 

To me, the reason I am getting my education, is because I want to improve myself, I want to do the work it will allow me to do, and as a distant third is the fact that it will allow me to earn more. 

I live in one of the most expensive countries in the world.

true,trycatch1,RUSS,Russia,"&gt; Sounds like VICE or news Republic would be your preferred journalistic style.

VICE News is not a major news outlet. Yes, I think that Simon Ostrovsky probably is the best reporter on this war for non-Russian/Ukrainian speaking folks. For Russian-speakers local citizen journalists in twitter are still much better though.

&gt; I agree that these news outlets aren't doing in depth military analysis of the conflict each and every day.

Well, in Sloviansk after 2 month of war even some old ladies were able distinguish BMP from Nona, while for these reporters every armored caterpillars vehicle still is a ""tank"". OK, apparently they don't have to be military experts to report on a war, or even have any idea about military aspect at all (seriously, you don't need to be a military expert to distinguish a BMP from a tank), but they probably shine in other areas? Maybe in covering deep political background, social and day-to-day life issues? Nope, coverage of all other topics are just as bad and shallow as their coverage of the military aspect.

&gt; As for the 'United' comment I think it's fairly obvious that the nation is in fact not united, but is fragmented in civil war. Hardly a distorted view.

&gt;you can at least put in the effort to not be poor

A statement used in various guises as a mantra but never effectively demonstrated on the scale of society other than through the means of anecdotes, which is of course not a real demonstration at all.

All the while, it has been demonstrated that simply being poor does hamper your judgment when making financial decisions. It has also been demonstrated that being part of a group that is deemed to perform less in society subconsciously makes you act like that group is stereotyped. Being poor actually gives you less perspective to envision your future, and when you can envision it, the financial security needed to make sound financial decisions is absent. ""Making an effort"" is a task that groups in society as whole struggle precisely because of their poor status. Many simply are not strong enough to help themselves, while still occupying a productive place in society.

On what is the assumption that if you just try, you have a x% chance to stop being poor based? And then, do you really think so highly of yourselves that this is true and most people simply are so inferior that they do not even try?

Taxes aren't about you, they're about society. To look at personal work contribution as the only factor for a functioning society doesn't work. It's not worth anything if nobody pays you, and you're not getting paid if nobody can afford it.

When you graduate, why won't you be paid a similar salary in Estonia as you would be in the states? Because nobody can afford it. Why? Because there's less money in the system. Why? Because there's nowhere near as much consumption going on in Estonia as there is in the states. Money begets money.

&gt;If you are not willing to put in the effort to improve your own life and help yourself, why should others do it for you?

It's extremely seldom that it's a question about effort. People don't actually want to stay poor. I have never met a person who actually wants to be poor. I've met people who *say* that it's awesome, that jobs suck etc. but what are they supposed to do, tell you their sob story and their history they're most probably ashamed of?

And most importantly, so that the next generation won't have the same problems. You break the trend.

A successful society doesn't think ""How much can I get out of this *right now*"", a successful society thinks a few generations ahead.

They are listing on the NYSE because most investors are in the US and a lot of the business/sales are in the US - NYSE is also a global exchange with huge liquidity etc.

They will be paying corporation tax in the UK. The UK has a low corporate taxation rate (especially compared to USA and Italy) and very low taxation on dividends, and an extremely good network of double-taxation treaties around the whole world and a particularly good one with The Netherlands.

When they see me name written down they struggle with the ""Geo"", so they end up saying ""Joff"" or ""Joffrey"" instead of ""Jeff"" and ""Jeffrey"".  In one extreme case, in Basel (Switzerland), I was referred to as ""Hoff"". 

My surname is also a problem because it sounds exactly like a relatively common German surname, but is spelled a different way.  This causes issues in both directions - if they see it written down then they can't pronounce it right, and if they hear it they can't spell it right.

true,Qwill2,null,null,"&gt; If *man* in English can mean *mankind* in some instances but *human male* in others than *Mensch* can certainly mean *person* in some contexts but *man* in others. 

Of course. But that last *man* in this quote is a *mankind* kind of *man*, right? If that's the case, I definitely need a course in language, because I'm totally agreeing with you.


&gt; B/c it's a very common German word and he used that word.

Yes. It's a common word to express *mankind*. 

&gt; The same reason people use *man* to mean *mankind* even though the word humanity exists to explicitly include women.

Fair enough. It's not uncommon to use *man* to mean *mankind* either. 

I'm argueing against those who protest that *Overhuman* is **wrong**. My argument is that *Overhuman* stands as a term that is more precise, and as I call it, more literal. By that I mean this:

* Nietzsche wrote *Mensch*.

* *Mensch* can't be misunderstood to mean *male man* in German. 

* *Human* can't be misunderstood to mean *male man* in English. 

* *Man* **can be misunderstood** to mean *male man* in English.

* All else being equal, *human* is preferable to *man*, and by extension **not wrong**, or less accurate.

The arguments against that have come up against this view, is that Nietzsche probably didn't mean to include women in this idea. This is based on Nietzsche's negative views on women overall, not in any particular quote where he explicitly says that women can't be overhuman. Now, whether Nietzsche did mean this, or whether he didn't, is irrelevant to the translation, since that would mean that the translation of one word does a lot more of the interpretive job (unbeknownst to the reader) that it is intended to. 

The fact that Nietzsche chose the word *Mensch*, while he (if he meant to state explicitly that women couldn't be overhuman) could have chosen *Mann*, shouldn't be disregarded in this matter.",0,1406905178,null,0,false,0,cjdzy51,t3_2cbth3,t1_cjdzy51,t1_cjdz8e9,null,1435015906,1,false,German,t5_2qq51,1

Actually, you can do that, and this has been done tons of times in the past. Countries are comprised of states/provinces, which can be targets of a war. This was clearly demonstrated when Russia invaded and seized Crimea just half a year ago. (Though in this case war was not officially declared).

Countries are much more centralized today, but in the past, the country was not based around the government, but rather the leader. There where many wars where vassals of the king fought against each other, or against foreign countries. 

War does not have a criteria of there being 2 countries. A war can involve 2 people. When this war was conducted, we where still at a point where vassals did wage war, so if they wanted Scilly could have invaded Netherlands (though had no chance of winning). 

As concluded by the parties in the article, it was a war, that was never finished. Its gets a bit muddy due to changes in political structure, but its much more complex then your water downed explanation.

true,serpenta,POLA,Mazovia,"That's true, Warsaw is still growing, so the money discrepancy is not a massive problrm here yet. But the hate war - fortunatelly only verbal - between the born Warsovians and those who came here to work is raging on.

The first are treating the other almost as some under-species: they loiter, they steal, they destroy public property and so on; most that's bad is their fault really, to some those rooted here.

And these migrants are viewed by the other side as worse educated (which is bullshit, since mostly people come to Warsaw to study and then start working), impolite, even dumber. All because they are from smaller towns.

On the other hand the migrants hate back, which is natural really, when you are disregarded and call names (they are called ""jars"", because they often govback to families for the weekend and return with food in jars).

And then there is the other, thankfully larger group of born Warsovians, including myself, who don't know what is the fuss about.

The migrants are regarded as not caring for the city and even hating it; and so why they stay instead of leaving home, these disrespectful Warsovians ask. While the answer is as easy as money and prospects.

Besides how one can feel in a place when he encounters active hate (more the internet hate than hatred thankfully), and has to live away from family and friends because of imbalanced country's growth.

The only real problem is that the migrants often doesn't notice our tax office that they change place of living, so they pay taxes outside Warsaw (here the taxes are divided between national and local governments).

But even that is already worked on by the city. F.i. it was lately proposed that people who pay taxes in Warsaw should have access to commuteral transport for free (it would be financed from city's taxes).

That's what I meant. Doesn't mankind mean humanity?

&gt;  You are trying to prove this and do it like math. That means nothing. I'm sorry. 

I set it up like that to make it clear what I meant, since I'm obviously misrepresenting my own case here. It's supposed to make it easy for you to point out which premise is mistaken. I don't see how that makes it like math, but OK. I think it looks more like syllogisms, though. I don't know how that ""means nothing"". 

&gt; Mensch can't be misunderstood to mean male man in German.

&gt; &gt; No. You don't know that. I know that in some parts of Austria/Germany it is offensive to call a woman by the singular Mensch this could be b/c of masculine implications in the singular and that Mensch is grammatically masculine.

Thanks for the information. No, I didn't know that (and neither do my discussion partners).

&gt;  Something possibly being misinterpreted does not make it invalid. 

I don't claim that anything is invalid. Why do you say I do? I'm argueing *against* those who claim that one particular translation (human) is invalid. I'm backing that particular translation, *that they say is invalid*, up with my arguments.

&gt; It doesn't matter than ""man"" can be mistaken as meaning something else. That invalidates nothing.

I'm not trying to invalidate anything. Where does this come from?

I'm facing people who are argueing that one interpretation is invalid. I'm protesting by saying that that one interpretation is better. How am I saying anything is invalidated?

&gt; Both super and over could be misinterpreted as meaning literally above as in a man standing at the top of the steps or something.

Of course.

&gt; That doesn't change that it can be interpreted correctly and thus is a valid translation.

Something is clearly wrong here. Could you copy-paste where I say that *man* is invalid/wrong, just so I can explain myself?

You are saying that ""human"" is preferable to man b/c ""man"" could be misinterpreted.

immagino che tu ti riferisca ai BOT e ai vari titoli di Stato.
Quando lo Stato emette un BOT è come se chiedesse un prestito, in questo caso verso la BCE che li stampa. Immaginati la BCE a saldo zero; compera 10 miliardi di debito pubblico in Europa e ora ha una riserva di denaro di -10 miliardi. Alla fine dei prestiti la BCE riceverà metti 10,5 miliardi di euro, 10 di cui vengono distrutti e 0,5 che rimangono in circolo, rappresentando la maggior ricchezza in circolo e contribuendo all'inflazione. Il motivo per cui Tesoro e Banca Centrale sono divisi è appunto per evitare che uno Stato copra i propri debiti continuando a stampare, mandando in vacca la credibilità della moneta. Se uno Stato fosse serio e affidabile se ne potrebbe fare a meno, ma dato che con un potere del genere è facile fare vaccate molto grosse in molto poco tempo allora storicamente si è rivelato vincente il modello che separa queste due funzioni, offrendo garanzie di stabilità della moneta (motivo per cui l'Euro è molto forte e sta dando la paga al dollaro che l'America continua a svalutare facendolo stampare alla FED)",0,1406908531,null,0,false,0,cje1pxb,t3_2c8e5i,t1_cje1pxb,t1_cjdz6oe,null,1435016948,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

Mi piace viaggiare, sono stato in (quasi) tutti i continenti e lo so, ne sono cosciente, quando mi trovo in un paese straniero, sono un pollo da spennare.  
E questo non mi pone nessun problema.

Il turismo, come molte altre cose, segue delle regole di business molto chiare. Hai una clientela (generalizzando, ovviamente) poco informata, con esigenze estemporanee e che a te, fornitore di un servizio, non interessa assolutamente fidelizzare in quanto, molto probabilmente, non li rivedrai mai più in tutta la tua vita. Probabilmente, come fornitore di servizio, ti interesserà avere un buon nome anche per via delle referenze che potrai prendere sui social network ma questo potrebbe essere sopperito dal fatto di avere una locazione vantaggiosa (ad es. avere un bar in Piazza San Marco).  

Ora, detto questo, visto che siamo indubbiamente uno dei paesi più appetibili al mondo dal punto di vista turistico, vogliamo imparare anche noi che chi viene a visitarci, si deve aspettare di pagare caro? Non è una questione di cattiveria ma di ""business"". Se continuamo a pensare che i prezzi bassi possano permetterci di avere più turisti, allora non avremo abbastanza denaro per rendere ancora più appetibili le vacanze in Italia.  
In Francia questo concetto lo hanno capito perfettamente. Hanno infinitamente meno cose da vedere rispetto a noi ma se le fanno pagare care e le mantengono in maniera splendida.  
Un esempio lampante potrebbe essere il Pont du Gard. Era impossibile recintare un ponte per fare pagare un biglietto quindi cosa hanno fatto? Hanno messo il divieto di sosta per le auto per un raggio di 3 km intorno al ponte e poi hanno costruito un parcheggio vicino il cui costo fisso (che ti fermi un minuto, un'ora o un giorno) è di 13 euro (se non erro). Ora, sono d'accordissimo che 13 euro per parcheggiare un minuto sono tantissimi ma non è di quello che stiamo parlando. Stiamo parlando del fatto che se io mi sono preso la briga di venire dall'Italia per vedere il ponte, quando mi ci trovo a 100 metri, pago 13 euro. E quei 13 euro servono sia per la manutenzione del ponte che per fare pubblicità al ponte nei paesi stranieri e attirare ancora più turisti.

Tornando a bomba sul gelato (bella questa, me la segno), un locale non andrà a sedersi a quel bar, probilmente conoscerà una gelateria in una stradina di fianco i cui prezzi sono di un terzo. I soldi sborsati dai turisti invece permetteranno sia al barista di avere un bar ancora più appetibile dal punto di vista turistico, sia allo stato, attraverso le tasse che il barista dovrebbe pagare, di manutenere e promuovere il posto dove il bar è locato.

Spesso si dice che il turismo è il nostro petrolio, ma voi avete mai sentito qualche compagnia petrolifera struggersi perchè la benzina costa troppo?

&gt;Mária Huber: Genau. Jeder auf seine Weise. Da beklagen deutsche Leitmedien, dass Russland eine Einflusszone behalten oder etablieren will. Aber dass eine Nato- oder EU-Mitgliedschaft osteuropäischer Länder eine westliche Einflusszone bedeutet, bleibt unerwähnt.

Oh. Mein. Gott.

Will sie ernsthaft amerikanisch-europäischen Lobbyismus (=soft power) gepaart mit freiwilliger Westannäherung der Ukraine mit **Annexionen souveräner Staaten und Finanzierung eines Bürgerkriegs** gleichsetzen - beziehungsweise Letzteres mit dem Erstgenannten zu entschuldigen?

Wow. Das ist nicht nur unfassbar dreist, das ist schon richtig, richtig dümmlich und tendenziös.

_______

**Nochmal für alle:**

&gt;Da beklagen deutsche Leitmedien, dass Russland eine Einflusszone behalten oder etablieren will.

**Nein.** Wir (=Der Westen) beklagen uns, dass Russland kriegstreiberisch auftritt, indem sie Teile ihrer Nachbarländer mal fix annektieren und den anderen Teil bewusst und gezielt destabilisieren und in bürgerkriegsähnliche Zustände stürzen. Russland richtet damit Schaden an und ist damit moralisch direkt für die Tode zahlreicher Menschen mitverantwortlich.

&gt;Aber dass eine Nato- oder EU-Mitgliedschaft osteuropäischer Länder eine westliche Einflusszone bedeutet, bleibt unerwähnt.

Das ist erstens selbstevident und zweitens wird das schon lange erwähnt. Der Punkt dabei ist nur, dass das keinen stört. Und wenn für eine Einflusszonenerweiterung nur gelobbied wird, wo ist das Problem?

Wieso macht Russland keinen Lobbyismus für ihre Eurasische Union? Ach ne, das machen sie ja auch. Hat nur nicht gereicht, weil alle trotzdem lieber zum Westen kommen. Lobbyismus durch beide Seiten klingt doch nach fairem Wettbewerb, oder nicht?

Und jetzt? Kaum dreht sich der Wind zu Ungunsten Russlands, schon packen se halt die Kanonen aus und nehmen ihre Nachbarländer ein. Alles klar. Ich glaub es hackt. Wie kommt man auf die wahnwitzige Idee sowas entschuldigen zu wollen?

&gt;Eine Geopolitik, die gegen Russland gerichtet ist?

&gt;Mária Huber: Es geht darum, Russland zu isolieren. Die Anfänge reichen ins Jahr 1993 zurück. Damals war USAID schon in der Ukraine tätig, und der ehemalige Nationale Sicherheitsberater Zbigniew Brzeziński hat ein American-Ukrainian Advisory Committee gegründet, um Lobbyarbeit zu machen und die Ukraine zu unterstützen. Mit der erklärten Begründung, dass ohne die Ukraine Russland nicht erstarken könne.

Ist für den Interviewpartner also schon die Verpuffung des Traums der zukünftigen Putin'schen  Eurasischen Union **ohne** die Ukraine eine Totalisolierung Russlands auf der internationalen Bühne? Noch tendenziöser gehts nicht.

Wer sagt, dass durch die Westannäherung momentane bilaterale Beziehungen von Russland und der Ukraine ausfallen? Richtig: niemand. Wer sagt, dass die Wirtschaftsbeziehungen zwischen Russland und der EU, oder der EU-Ukraine nicht vertieft werden können? Richtig: niemand.

Stichwort Isolation: Ich weiß jedenfalls, wie man sich ziemlich schnell politisch und wirtschaftlich isolieren kann: wenn man [demokratische, volkslegitimierte Nachbarstaaten](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werchowna_Rada) annektiert und Bürgerkriege in diesem mit modernen Waffensystemen unterstützt. Ich behaupte jetzt einfach mal ganz pauschal, dass Russland sich mit seiner Geopolitik selber isoliert - da müsste man nichtmal nachhelfen.

Letzten Endes steht jedenfalls eines fest:  Jeder Staat steht eben nur für sich und kann nicht erwarten ein natürliches Recht auf irgendein günstiges Einflussgebiet zu haben.

Und wenn Putin jetzt seiner Eurasischen Union hinterherweint, dann soll er doch einfach einsehen, dass er das auch ohne die Ukraine durchziehen kann und bilaterale Beziehungen zur EU oder auch der europäischen Ukraine unterhalten kann. Wieso sollte die Europäisierung der Ukraine unweigerlich Nachteile für Russland mitbringen? Wird halt immer so schön impliziert, aber nie näher ausgeführt.

Und wenn wir hier von langfristiger Geopolitik sprechen: Wieso sollte es für Russland nicht möglich sein, bei voranschreitender Liberalisierung und [Demokratisierung](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelenkte_Demokratie#Russland) bei der EU der Zukunft mitzumachen? Wüsste nicht, wieso das ausgeschlossen sein sollte. Nur das geht halt nicht, wenn man so mit seinen Nachbarn umgeht, wie Russland das macht.

I'm middle class and I think that system is unfair. I understand that 150€/month (what 1/3 of the workers earn) is not a living wage and the sheer amount of poverty among the workers in Romania.

But actually, even this unfair system wouldn't be that much a problem if the taxes would actually be spent in the interest of the people. 

The amount of corruption is insane. Every politician is corrupt and taking bribes and informal payments, one way or the other. This is not an exaggeration or a hyperbole, it's the truth.

We've had more than a hundred politicians arrested for corruption, including a former Prime-Minister, the President's brother, more than a dozen ministers and countless MPs and mayors, but these were just the unlucky ones.

The french industrial interests are irrelevant compared to the big picture. Not delivering the carriers to Russia would be sending a signal that Europe can't be trusted when it comes to defense contracts **as a partner**

Yes, it is important to be vocal about Russian destabilisation in Ukraine but it is even more important to prevent the coming of a new Cold War.

And the fact is that neither Russia nor the European Union has any interest in a new Cold War, for several reasons :

* **first, Russia is not a military threat to europe through conventiona forces**. The European Union outspends Russian military spendings by a factor of 3. We are richer, more populated and our military hardware is second to only the US one (and even there, we build as good if not superior tanks and missiles. Us superiority is on the air force departement). 

* **It may looks like a paradox but on the other hand Russia is the only existential threat to Europe through nuclear missiles.** While we may not fear a conventional forces invasion of Europe from the Russian army, we may fear a nuclear arms race if Russia thinks it can't trust its European neighbours. **In that regard, the installation of early warning radars in Poland from the US as a part of anti-missile shield is a huge geostrategical mistake, an order of magnitudes worse than any mistral carrier sales**. Not only does it protect from shit (anti-missile shield is unreliable and completly ineffective against a full scale nuclear attack) but it was felt in the kremlin as an attempt to counter Russia's nuclear Arsenal. A new cold war with russia might very well revive the nuclear stand-off of the soviet era and it is a very dangerous game : [Remember 1983 nuclear scare where we almost went into a nuclear war by accident !](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Nuclear_War_Scare) 

* Manyh other reasons including economical and diplomatic ones which i won't enter too much into detail. Let us just say that Russia could be a friendly country and an ally rather than an enemy. Poutine is ruthless but he is no James Bond villain.

On the other hand, delivering the carriers :

* send a signal that the European Union is willing to cooperate when it comes to defense. Which is good as it lowers distrust from Russia and also makes it more difficult for russia to sever its links with the countries on which it is dependent from a part of its weaponry. **You can't build a war machine if you are dependent on other countries hardware**

* lowers the tension when it comes to ukraine as Russia won't be cornered into going another step further into the escalation of sanctions.

Now, that doesn't mean that Nato and the european union should do nothing. In the same time that the carriers are delivered, the big guns of European countries in NATO should schedule military exercises in Estern europe and nordic countries to assess that Ukrain is Ukraine but if Russia dares on trying the same trick with a small country member of NATO like Latvia, Europe won't stand it.

For example, France, Germany, the UK and Poland could each deploy a full division for said exercise.

The signal sent would be that Europe is still open for cooperation but if russia wants to use its muscle in Eastern Europe, NATO won't cower in. **Deterrence and credible defence, not bullying**",0,1406910567,null,0,false,1,cje2w68,t3_2ccdtb,t1_cje2w68,t1_cje1ifv,null,1435017388,18,false,france,t5_2qhjz,18

Was genau ist es denn, dieses etwas,  das besser ist, und wie wurde es dazu?  Was europäisches Christen- und Judentum vom Islam unterscheidet, ist, dass der Glaube vieler ihrer Anhänger ein ungeglaubter Glaube (Adorno) ist.  Es handelt sich also um eine Art Protoaufgeklärtheit, die noch nicht durchgezündet hat. Diese kam meines Erachtens nur deswegen zustande, weil die Juden und Christen Europas nunmehr jahrhundertelang die Errungenschaften von Wissenschaft und Technik in ihrer Lebenswelt beobachten und dadurch selbst ihren »Geruch« ein Stück in ihre Ideologie weit angenommen haben.  Man merkt es z.B. daran, wie Kreationisten versuchen, ihren Mülltheorien den Anschein der Wissenschaftlichkeit zu geben.  Im Islam ist das anders: da die letzten Errungenschaften eines Moslems auf diesem Gebiet viele Jahrhunderte alt sind, sich also in Wissenschaft und Technik das Versagen der islamischen Kultur widerspiegelt, lehnt man sie als westlich ab.  Boko Haram ist hier nur das schlimmste Beispiel, aber dieselbe Tendenz lässt sich in jeder islamistischen Strömung finden.  Diese identitär versteinerte Gleichzeitigkeit des Ungleichzeitigen versperrt jedoch der Entwicklung eines ungeglaubten Glaubens im islamischen Kulturraum (auch dem in der Fremde) den Weg.  Dieser wäre aber eine notwendige Bedingung für die Herausbildung eines islamischen Republikanismus, welcher seinerseits Bedingung für emanzipatorisches Denken und eine friedliche Koexistenz mit dem Westen wäre.  Dass sich durch die Immigration aus diesen Gebieten nun eine Reaktion beider ideologischen Dispositionen vollzieht, macht die Sache umso hässlicher.  Auf den propalästinensischen »Friedensdemonstrationen« tummeln sich arabische Neonazi-Äquivalente, die keinen legitimen Anspruch auf die Früchte emanzipatorischer Errungenschaften anmelden könnten.  Sie fressen das soziale Kapital wie Säure.

Zur Kernfrage des Artikels: Inwiefern sind die moderaten Anhänger einer ideologischen Gruppe für die Missetaten ihrer Extremisten haftbar zu machen? Um so mehr, je schwieriger es ist, zwischen beiden zu unterscheiden.  Wenn es wirklich eines Tages einmal daran gehen sollte, den militanten islamistischen Müll weltweit rauszutragen, wird man vor dem Problem stehen, diese Islamistenkrieger dann auch zu identifizieren.  Die sich dabei ergebenden Schwierigkeiten hat man ja deutlich in Gaza, Afghanistan, Irak und an vielen anderen Orten gesehen: Das Distinktionsgebot des Kriegsrechts lässt sich in diesen Kulturkreisen schlicht nicht erfüllen, weil sich kein Kämpfer an den Uniformzwang gebunden fühlt, da die ihm zu Grunde liegenden Erfahrungen dort nicht gemacht wurden.  Ergo wird man sie nachholen müssen, und das bedeutet, dass bewaffnete Konflikte dort nicht in den Grenzen des Kriegsrechts geführt werden können, wenn man nachhaltige »Erfolge« erzielen will.  Wofern man dies doch versucht, endet man wie Israel an einem Punkt, an dem der Gegner zwar nichts mehr erreichen kann, und trotzdem nicht kapitulieren will, während die einzigen Optionen zur Steigerung der eigenen militärischen Schlagkraft Genozid und Vertreibung sind.  Irgendwann wird sich diese Frage stellen, und wenn sie ihre Antwort erwartet, werden auch die Moderaten Position beziehen müssen. Und meiner Erfahrung nach stehen die Moderaten im Zweifel immer an der Seite ihrer Extremisten.

Wenn man die von der Autorin formulierte Frage stellt, steht man vor einem Paradoxon: Man verlangt von einem Unmündigen Verantwortung.  Wenn man von einem Moderaten erwartet, dass er mäßigend auf seine Extremisten einwirke, um interideologische Spannungen zu lindern, setzt man ihn ihm eine Reflektiertheit voraus, die er gar nicht haben kann, weil er sonst nicht religiös wäre.  Man verlangt von ihm, dass er den Willen zum interreligiösen Frieden über seinen Gott stellt, was er aber nicht tun kann, solange sein Glaube kein ungeglaubter ist.

true,CanadianJesus,NRW,Nordrhein-Westfalen,"Well, if you're going to get your degree in the UK with an exchange year in Germany, you should start looking into what kind of exchange programs your intended university in the UK is involved with. I can't say for sure how it works in the UK but my home University basically had a bunch of Universities in Germany they were partnered with and I had to apply for the spots at my home University. Once I had passed that application I was basically finished and the final application to KIT was more or less a formality. If you want to study at a University that your University isn't partnered with, you have to go through their application procedure which can be a lot more protracted. 

I should say that the German university system is a bit different from the UK and the Germans don't really put much weight on the majors you're interested in studying. With that said, it's not that they don't exist in Germany, but they are not that common and before you decide on a University in Germany you should really make sure that they can accommodate you properly. I had a friend at the KIT that studied Germanistik (German language and literature) and he had only a handful of courses to chose from. Just make sure that you don't end up at a technical university intending to study journalism.

To sum up, you should find a University in the UK that fits your needs and see what kind of partner universities they have in Germany. Worst case, they don't have any that fit your needs and you have to apply to a German university on your own.

Consider this:

“Race is an exceedingly slippery concept. Although it appears in social life as ubiquitous, omnipresent and real, it is hard to pin down the concept in any objective sense, this is because the idea of race is riddled with apparent contradictions. While it is a dynamic phenomena rooted in political struggle, it is commonly observed as a fixed characteristic of human populations; while it does not exist in terms of human biology, people routinely look to the human body for evidence about racial identity; while it is a biological fiction, it is nonetheless a social fact.” James 2008

true,Subotan,ZUK,UK,"&gt;Not delivering the carriers to Russia would be sending a signal that Europe can't be trusted when it comes to defense contracts as a partner

But what about France's reputation within the rest of Europe? What does providing the Mistral say about whether Europe can be trusted to help those countries in Europe which fear Russia?

&gt;first, Russia is not a military threat to europe through conventional forces.

Yes and no. Obviously Russian soldiers aren't going to be marching along the Champs Élysées or in Trafalgar Square any time soon. However, Russia is definitely a threat to the post-war, liberal democratic order built upon European Unity. Indirectly but through that threat, Russian conventional war is the single biggest threat to peace in Europe. Nuclear missiles might threaten the entire human race, but that's not what's at issue here.

&gt;In that regard, the installation of early warning radars in Poland from the US as a part of anti-missile shield is a huge geostrategical mistake

Those were actually withdrawn, much to the chagrin of the Poles, because the Russians were unhappy. The Russians know that if they're peaceful and respect the system of international law the West is plenty prepared to co-operate on security and trade issues. We've demonstrated that enough in the past, and the way the Russians are behaving now is not the result of us pissing them off, it's because Putin has trapped himself between a Ukraine that is now desperate to escape Russia's orbit and domestic support that expects him to do anything to keep Ukraine in its ""place"". The West could have gone along with this and it wouldn't change the facts on the ground.

&gt;The signal sent would be that Europe is still open for cooperation but if russia wants to use its muscle in Eastern Europe, NATO won't cower in. Deterrence and credible defence, not bullying

I agree, but I think it's hard for us to be able to act credibly when we are continuing to supply the Russians with arms. Britain seized numerous neutral warships on the outbreak of WWI that they were building for other powers, and with good reason - the Turkish ships that were seized would have been turned against the Allies had they not been requisitioned.

With English being the lingua franca, they have much stronger reach, but also one must admit that they did develop new things which deserved to be spread around, notably in music (heavy metal, punk, classic rock and pop bands..), and classic British humor. 

In these domains, I don't think there's any European country which does better (ie, they deserve being number 1), however, other countries do better in other areas (to take France for example, I'd mention comic books perhaps), and while other countries can have cultural influence through other mediums, the task isn't made easy by the fact that their language isn't English. That's why, ladies and gents, language dominance is so important, because it's important for the economy.

Those sorts of cash transfers are a regular thing in other fiscal unions, not one-off emergency measures. In the US this is the primary purpose of the federal government collecting taxes from the states -- it redistributes money constantly to the less productive members of the union so that the more productive ones can continue their level of success. Otherwise, the poorer states would have to somehow gain control of their currency to control prices. This is the biggest flaw in the Euro, but it can be fixed. 

The banking crisis was a separate issue that exposed weaknesses, but it isn't *the* underlying problem.

And the workers wages have remained the same...

So just because a currency devalues by 25% doesn't mean all things rise by 25% because a huge component in all creation is human labour and that (wages) has remained the same.

So devaluing makes a country more competitive because it makes workers labour cheaper compared to other countries, but it doesn't proportionally raise the costs inside the country by the same amount.

So if you have a country where for too many years people used debt to inflate salaries and pretend to be rich and then all of a sudden there is a crash, what do you do? If you devalue you reduce the wages in the country back to a more competitive level, if you don't then you can only achieve the same goal by forcing people to take salary cuts or firing them and rehiring someone cheaper.

But Eastern and Central Europeans don't fear nuclear war (except in the same abstract way we do), but in Russian meddling with conventional armed forces. The nuclear umbrella doesn't necessarily cover that kind of attack.

&gt;Still, that is one of the reason i was advising for military exercices in order to provide re-assurance.

Military exercises are politically cheap. They won't provide the reassurance the Baltic and other Eastern Europeans want in that if it ever comes to Crunch Time, they know we are at their back. 

&gt;Except that Russian military is nowhere near the level of readiness that would indicate it is willing and/or able to take on the rest of Europe.

I don't mean in the sense of a continental, conventional war, but in the way that Russian interference in Ukraine and their belligerence towards the rest of Europe creates uncertainty and fear. The point of the post-war European order is that it's supposed to be completely European, and if one part of Europe is under attack then the entire system is damaged.

&gt;let us compare with what is comparable, shall we ? At the time of WW I, europe was a lot more instable than today and more of all, the war level of readiness was order of magnitudes higher than now.

I wasn't saying it was comparable, just that there is a precedent for this kind of thing and it has been the right call in the past. This isn't a huge step into the unknown as the French government seems to be saying it is.

These rebels will not only be fighting with AK-47s but will (clearly) have weapons that can take down airliners from 10 km in the air. 

Then it becomes a question of what the West should do. If it does nothing, Russia will equip and train the rebels far better than the Ukrainian army (and likely provide troops under the guise of Russians going their of their own free will). They will essentially be able to take anything in Ukraine they want. What is next, Moldova? The Baltics? The baltics would be hard to do the same thing militarily due to increased US and NATO forces there, but Russia could certainly create unrest within the Russian community.

If the West arms Ukraine, more lives could be lost. It is really a catch-22, because Putin should not be allowed to take any sections of neighboring countries that he wants.

&gt;Average effective federal income tax rate (2010, middle quintile): 11.5% .

&gt;Social security. 12.5%

&gt;Average effective state income rate (middle quintile): 9.4%

- What was it, husband, why are you so happy?

- I dreamt that I went to Bucharest.

- And why is that good?

- They didn't let me in without a visa.

Also, there were two kinds of Stasi people. The first kind were official employees, run of the mill paper pushers with administrative functions and people doing good old fashioned detective work. They were officially employed by ""the firm"" and were known as such. 

The second kind were the IM guys. Those usually held a regular job and worked for the Stasi on the side. Their employment was a secret. They were often recruited to inform on friends and colleagues. In quite a number of cases they were pressured into service, their cooperation was a deal they made in order to stay out of prison themselves. 

Regardless, it all came crashing down in reunification. 

All the regulars lost not only their jobs, but also their perks. Within a few months they became social outcasts and had to live off benefits when they used to belong to the elite. Most of the people I knew to be regulars pulled up stakes and moved to places where nobody knew them and their pasts. Still, most of them had trouble finding employment. Their degrees in Marxist philosophy and socialistic ideology were simply utterly useless on the job market. 

The IMs often continued to live their lives, often praying they would not be discovered. Remember, they had spied on friends and family, so this could cause substantial rifts.

It might have been the case but i don't think you fully realize the scale of the exercise i am talking about. Exercises where a full division of 10 to 16 thousands soldiers are projected from Western to Baltic and estern europe is extremely uncommon (might be unrivaled actually) : most of exercises over that big a distance involve a few hundred foreign soldiers at maximum.

It won't go cheap either. We are talking heavy hardware that is expensive to move around. The cost might very well be around tens if not hundred of millions of euros. *That* is the kind of reassurance i am talking about : if we can do it for an exercise, we can do it if the gloves come off. And a division, especially an armored one, is the kind of military size that is credible in defense.

Agreed. And my position isn't set in stone either : i am going to look very carefully at Russian next moves. But for know, i don't think we should act directly against Russia yet while we still have other options availables.

I know most work sucks, but not having a job at all sucks more.

Do you think the people who do that warehouse pushing of packages now will find rewarding, creative jobs after they lose their jobs?

And we're also replacing other jobs. I write software for water management. There used to be people working in water management in the Netherlands who kept an eye on water levels, the weather, water quality, and who turned the right engines on and off by hand. Later they would make GIS models of their systems on their computers and work out themselves where flooding problems could occur. And they really, really knew their own region.

Now our software does much of that -- everything is measured, dikes have thousands of sensors per km, we predict rain from a set of radar stations, predict how water levels will change a few hours in advance, and turn on the mills before the rain starts to fall so the water level can already drop a bit in anticipation. We have cm-precision height maps of the Netherlands in 50x50cm square resolution, and can make flooding models using that in real time based on current water levels (exaggerating slightly -- all this is under development and most of it is used in practice in some parts of the country, but not close to everywhere yet).

But is that actually *cheaper*? It's a lot of development and a lot of technology. And the answer is often, yes, after a number of years, by 10% or so.

The Euro is a currency regulated by a weak central government, something that has never really happened before.

For the importers and less wealthy states in the Euro, this is a disaster since it means everything they need costs more.

It's good that the EU redistributes some wealth true, but it does not come even close to what the US federal government does among its states (for obvious reasons, try being a politician in Germany or the UK and convincing your people it's a good idea to send their money abroad).

true,Rc72,null,null,"&gt; we french have witnessed the US trying to destroy the european industry of defense, very much including ours, indirectly through programs like the f-35 for years so that level of reaction is understandable.

Actually, this is more than a bit unfair. The truth is that much of the Western European defence industry (including the French) exists *thanks* to the Americans. It was US money that paid for Western European rearmament during the Cold War, and the Yanks actually bought themselves many of those weapons *from* European factories *for* European armies through the [Military Assistance Program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_Defense_Assistance_Act#Mutual_Assistance_Program_-_Military_Assistance_Program). If companies like Dassault exist today, it's very much thanks to that money. Resentful British military aircraft buffs like to complain about how US pressure scuttled the (incredibly pretty) [BAC TSR-2 project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAC_TSR-2), for instance, but forget that the reason why the Americans could end it was that they were the ones who were bankrolling it in the first place.

Of course, US arms companies like that sweet, sweet money as much as anybody else, and are very adept at lobbying the US Congress to get it, but it's rather unfair to assert that the purpose of the F-35 has been to ""destroy"" the European defence industry. Indeed, from the US point of view, they've gone out of their way to give a big workshare to European companies...

Indeed, the ones who have been most efficient in destroying the European defence industry have been the Europeans themselves (not least the French), by trying to maintain competing arms programmes with shrinking budgets, rather than cooperating more between them. I'm not an F-35 fan, but the intra-European competition between Rafale, Eurofighter and Gripen is a joke (not to say anything about the internal arrangements of Eurofighter, with four separate assembly lines)...

So yes you have to be careful. Same applies for Mexico. I never said anything about Mexican invasions. I simply said Mexico needs USA trade in order for their economy to function and grow. This includes Mexicans sending money back to Mexico from their USA wages. I would agree with that that no one is allowed to invade Mexico though. USA would protect them. USA is very friendly with both Mexico and Canada. We share the biggest border in the world with Canada and have zero issues with them.

What is wrong with protecting allies. USA would protect any country that is friendly with them. USA accepts help in return. Countries came to help US with Afghanistan invasion and it was all appreciated even though none of them are as rich as USA so their help is always a bigger sacrifice on their part.

I don't think I am a megalomaniac for thinking USA is a good country that does some bad shit that I openly criticize. I am also allowed to criticize it. There isn't state media or dead reporters either. Russians are also delusional of they think they are fucked by USA or under attack. It has never happened. When a Russian talks about evil USA I will tell him to go fuck himself. When an Iranian does it, I will say I am sorry.

I also see plenty of people openly state that USA is biggest threat on the planet and glorify CHINA and RUSSIA. They act like those countries are fighting the good fight by keeping USA from taking over the planet and are scared of how USA is a threat even to Western European countries. Crazy delusional privileged assholes. They sit in comfort in a Western Country glorifying countries that are abusing their own citizens and invading and oppressing their neighbors with zero fucks given.

Just a bunch of delusional nationalists in regards to Russia and China. Russia takes over countries and the people there are proper fucked. Poland switches sides and they grow and prosper. I would like Ukraine to join NATO and EU so the people will be safe and have a chance for a better life. I am happy to have my taxes going to people being safer around the world and it would be nice to have more people join the ideals of Western Europe. China does the same shit with their neighbors. North Korea is just criminal compared to the prosperity of South Korea. China is also trying to take over all of Asia. Their actions in the South China Sea is essentially an invasion on all their neighbors and robbing them of their resources. USA doesn't do this kind of shit. Their allies are treated as equals. When France tells USA to fuck off, USA just deals with it. They don't invade France in retaliation. We are friends not slave masters.

You probably know that French people tend to dress a bit nicer than many other countries. You might choose the clothes you bring accordingly. (Nothing wrong with jeans for social life, though it's possible they'll be frowned on for work.)

Bring enough personal care products to give you some time to sort out what local product might work for you and where to get it. Maybe bring some candies you really like that can help if you have a moment of homesickness.

You've probably heard that it's important to be polite and follow social customs in France. Be sure to read up on that, it really helps have good interactions with people, especially those you're trying to get help form. 

e.g. read this: http://moreintelligentlife.com/story/parisians-rude-pas-du-tout?page=full and seek out articles like it.

There were a series of jokes about Albanian technology back in the 80/90s. Such as: 

The Albanians built a submarine. Only problem was, every 1 minute it had to float back on the surface of the water. Why? Because the rowers needed some air to breathe. 

===

Next they built a supersonic aircraft. After the test flight, it was announced that a terrible accident had happened, the aircraft was destroyed, and there was one sole survivor from the crew - the coal shoveler.

===

Then they also built a rocket and were preparing to launch it in space. However, when everything was set, the attempt failed, because the main launching rope got torn. 

===

On Albanian TV, it was known that every evening news started with ""Good evening, Enver Hoxha (name of the Albanian dictator). Why was that? Because he was the only person in Albania who had TV.

And Spanish was never big in Europe, they have their eyes turned to Latin America naturally. 

France here is trying to salvage what can be salvaged. It can be perceived as ridiculous at times, but it stems from basic geopolitical and economic strategy, and France would be stupid to give up. Every country offers foreign student programs, or finances language schools abroad specifically because they know knowledge of their language and culture is important. It's perhaps more visible a strategy from France because, despite the decline, the French language still has remnants of strongholds. Thus we're perceived as smug or something, just because we're trying to defend our interests.

No, and I don't have to. I will however put it simply. The distinction between a subpoena and a warrant is important, when the court decides to ignore this distinction and make their own new hybrid subpoena-warrant they are treading onto the ground legislative branch. Their job is not to make up new unspoken laws, their job is to judge if the current law is being followed. To make these kinds of things up on a whim from the side of the court makes the justice system unbalanced, and frankly it goes beyond their reach. That is why it is corruption. It lacks any kind of integrity. 

Even if they decide through another corrupt turn to call this 'lawful' in the US, then it does not change that it is corrupt. Just because something is law then it does not mean it is not corrupt.

To characterize these processes, we have reconstructed aggregate intellectual mobility over two millennia through the birth and death locations of more than 150,000 notable individuals. The tools of network and complexity theory were then used to identify characteristic statistical patterns and determine the cultural and historical relevance of deviations. The resulting network of locations provides a macroscopic perspective of cultural history, which helps us to retrace cultural narratives of Europe and North America using large-scale visualization and quantitative dynamical tools and to derive historical trends of cultural centers beyond the scope of specific events or narrow time intervals.

True, but that's actual Russian territory for once. Not counting the fact that Kadirov is currently *extremely* pro russian and tends to ... remove any concurrents around.


Basically, regarding to the ship, allow me to put it that way :

Not speaking about the medditeranean of course. However if they don't attack us we're no threat to them. Hell they should know we're basically just looking for excuses for them to back down, stfu for once, and go back doing business.
