Il y a des méthodes pour mettre en place un vote informatique suffisamment transparent et surveillé. Cela passe — entre autre — par des administrateurs systèmes de confiance pour gérer les serveurs. Un peu comme les responsables des bureaux de vote, qui eux manipulent des bouts de papiers et font les comptes.

They (or he, I guess) got my vote because they are the most pro-EU party, which I feel very strongly about.

true,bobdole3,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; I was wondering, where did you all go to University/College and what helped you decide where to go?

For my undergrad I went to the University of Massachusetts. I also spent a year abroad studying at the University of Leeds, in England. UMASS was mostly a combination of choices; it's one of the best schools in the state (those pricks Harvard can suck it), and does a lot of work with the federal government so it gets a ton of research funding. It's also pretty big, so even if you don't know what to do, it's not hard to find a well-developed department to work with. Finally, the cost was probably the biggest factor. I narrowed my choices down to UMASS and Boston University; UMASS cost about $20,000 a year, while BU cost about $45,000. 

As for Leeds, that was mostly a matter of practicality. I wanted to study abroad, but competition for spots was pretty tight, and lots of schools were restricted by major. I really wanted to go to UCL, but they weren't taking political science or history majors at the time. I think my only options other than Leeds were places out in the middle of nowhere, so I went to the place I thought was most interesting. I also had quite a few options for countries that weren't English speaking, but I didn't feel confident moving to a country if I couldn't speak the language. 

&gt; What would you say are the best (preferably english speaking to a degree) universities in Europe that an American would know off the top of his head? 

Honestly, the only European universities I had ever heard of before I had started college were Cambridge and Oxford. If you're planning on working in the US, getting a degree abroad can be something of a double-edged sword. If you're getting a degree in a field like History, then it will give the impression that you're worldly, and have a closer relation to the subject, which is good. If you're getting a degree in Medicine though, it might give the impression that you're not going to be up to snuff with American standards, making it difficult to employ you. 

&gt; For background knowlege, my SAT scores are about 1800, and I have taken/will take 5 AP tests.

1800 isn't a bad score, though it might not be quite high enough to get into some of the really top tier schools if you don't have some really solid grades and extra curriculars. Were you 600 across the board, or did you do really well on 2 of the subjects and tank the third? Most schools don't much care about the writing portion (because they all have their own writing tests), so if you lost some points there it might actually make you look a bit better than if you scored low on the math portion. Of course, this assumes that your schools will even take the SATs. When I applied abroad for my undergrad, some would only take ACTs. 

As for the AP tests, it really depends on what they are in and how well you scored. In the US, if you scored a 4 or a 5 on each test, that would mean that you'd get credit for 5 full classes, knocking an entire semester out for you. I don't think that same agreement exists with most European schools, but if you score well it can still be something to put on to your application. You should definitely bring it up with the admissions board of whatever school you're applying to though; you might get lucky and have the tests honored if you did well enough. 

edit: finally, I can only speak for the UK, not Europe as a whole, but you absolutely *must* know what your major is before you get started. In the US, most schools don't even let you pick a major until your second year, and you spend a fair amount of time hitting up classes designed to round you out and give you some experience in a variety of fields. It's assumed that you'll have already done all of that already in the UK, so at university you need to hit the ground running. 

You also take fewer classes in general, so each one matters a lot more. At Leeds I was maxed out at 3 classes a semester, and uni in the UK only lasts 3 years. In the US, the standard is usually around 5 (though it can go to 4 or 6 depending on credits), and school lasts for 4 years.

Thomas Piketty’s book, ‘Capital in the Twenty-First Century’, has been the publishing sensation of the year. Its thesis of rising inequality tapped into the zeitgeist and electrified the post-financial crisis public policy debate.

But according to a Financial Times investigation, the rock-star French economist appears to have got his sums wrong.

The data underpinning Professor Piketty’s 577-page tome, which has dominated best-seller lists in recent weeks, contain a series of errors that skew his findings. The FT found mistakes and unexplained entries in his spreadsheets, similar to those that last year undermined the work on public debt and growth of Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff.

The central theme of Prof Piketty’s work is that wealth inequalities are heading back up to levels last seen before the first world war. The investigation undercuts this claim, indicating there is little evidence in Prof Piketty’s original sources to bear out the thesis that an increasing share of total wealth is held by the richest few.

Prof Piketty, 43, provides detailed sourcing for his estimates of wealth inequality in Europe and the US over the past 200 years. In his spreadsheets, however, there are transcription errors from the original sources and incorrect formulas. It also appears that some of the data are cherry-picked or constructed without an original source.

For example, once the FT cleaned up and simplified the data, the European numbers do not show any tendency towards rising wealth inequality after 1970. An independent specialist in measuring inequality shared the FT’s concerns.

Contacted by the FT, Prof Piketty said he had used “a very diverse and heterogeneous set of data sources . . . [on which] one needs to make a number of adjustments to the raw data sources.

“I have no doubt that my historical data series can be improved and will be improved in the future . . . but I would be very surprised if any of the substantive conclusion about the long-run evolution of wealth distributions was much affected by these improvements,” he said.

His contention to have found a “central contradiction of capitalism” has in recent months made him a hero of the left. Although his conclusions have stirred controversy, there has, until now, been near unanimous praise for the quality of his statistical work.

On a tour of the US last month, Prof Piketty met Jack Lew, US Treasury secretary, gave a presentation to the White House Council of Economic Advisers and lectured at the International Monetary Fund and the UN.

Nobel Prize-winning economists have heaped praised on Mr Piketty’s work. Professor Paul Krugman of Princeton University said it was safe to say the book “will be the most important economics book of the year – and maybe of the decade”.

Professor Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia University said Prof Piketty’s “fundamental contribution” was the provision of data on the distribution of wealth. It was the subject of laudatory reviews in the FT and other publications.

In Britain, Ed Miliband, Labour leader, told the Evening Standard: “I’m in the early stages of the book. In a way, he is symptomatic of what people are actually feeling.”

In his response to the FT, Prof Piketty said that more recent data not in his work showed “the rise in top wealth shares in the US in recent decades has been even larger than what I show in my book”.",0,1401032490,null,0,false,0,chqqr4y,t3_26e813,t1_chqqr4y,t1_chqp31f,null,1433948243,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

It wasn't mere ""tensions"" at the electoral station near Ledra Palace, like the mass media wanted to convey (those who care to do so at all)

The government sent the anti-terror squad at the electoral station that was full with Turkish Cypriots protesting their exclusion from the electoral catalogue. That's their concept of Democracy! Where on earth does the anti-terror squad invade an electoral station?!

Among the protesters there were KTöS trade-unionists [Turkish Cypriot Teachers Union], who demanded to receive written proof of being denied the right to vote from the Minister of Interior, and they succeeded in doing so. Using that proof, they will go legally after the Republic. 

The Minister wasn't there to talk to the protesters, of course, but rather to attack them. ""I can't discuss with mouthy women"" and ""I have more important matters to attend"" were some of his expressions. Among others, he mentioned ""Wasn't enough that we granted them a favour and let [some of] them vote?"" 

But that was no favour! They took away their democratic right!

The Turkish Cypriots who possess a RoCyprus ID card are EU citizens and like all other EU nationals, they have the right to vote in the European Elections.

Sharing land and a language has always been there, but the idea that people who share land and a language are equal is fairly new.

As a dual US-UK citizen, I'd strongly recommend you attend a university in the UK, since they have far greater name recognition in the US than universities on the continent. Of the schools in the UK, you'll never have to tell an American employer what Oxford, Cambridge, LSE, UCL, and maybe Imperial are. Depending on what you want to study, I'd try to get in to one of these. The downside of the former two is that they're very hard to get in to, and the downside of the latter three are their location in London, which is insanely expensive. Beyond these, St. Andrews, Durham, Edinburgh, and Warwick are all good schools in the UK. Because you mentioned St. Andrews, I'll mention that I have an American friend who did his undergraduate there, and enjoyed it thoroughly, though he made a point of saying that there are a huge number of American students there, making it seems less like a British school.

Do what you wan with this information. Beyond that, I'd suggest taking the SATs one or two more times to try and get a higher score, however.

true,dClauzel,Rhone,Rhône-Alpes,"On peut naturellement faire de la démocratie directe avec des votes papiers, mais c'est plus long, et bien plus cher.

Imaginons que les citoyens d'une ville soient sollicités une fois par mois pour arbitrer une décision locale. Les municipalités n'ont pas les moyens financiers d'assurer 12 référendums par an, sans compter les élections nationales habituelles.

Avec le vote informatique — et l'adaptation du vote papier : bulletin unique à cocher, etc — on peut faire baisser les coûts d'un vote, et donc d'en faire plus souvent.

Le vote informatique en lui-même est neutre : il peut être utilisé soit pour que les citoyens prennent directement une décision, soit pour désigner un représentant qui prendra les décisions à leur place, soit pour autre chose. Mais tant qu'à faire, puisqu'on se donne la possibilité d'organiser plus facilement un vote, autant demander directement aux citoyens de s'exprimer, plutôt que de passer par le proxy d'un élu.

Historiquement, les élus avaient pour rôle de représenter à Paris les gens de la campagne. Voyager depuis — par exemple — Toulouse pour monter à la capitale, voter, puis redescendre, pouvait prendre plusieurs semaines. Sans parler des territoires d'outre-mer. Difficile pour un paysan de s'occuper à la fois de son champ et de passer du temps au Parlement pour voter. Donc on désigne des représentants : les élus. Également, l'alphabétisation était moindre : on envoyait à Paris les gens cultivés, sachant lire et écrire (pour faire simple, les notables).

De facto, l'élu était indispensable à la pratique démocratique, car le citoyen ne pouvait pas s'en occuper lui-même.

Arrive le 21^e siècle, avec les téléphones, internet, la télévision, la radio, le fort niveau d'étude général, etc. Quel est alors le rôle de l'élu, dans une société où chacun (faisons abstraction des problèmes sociaux) a la possibilité de s'informer, et donc de se former son propre avis ? Également, les déplacements vers les bureaux de vote sont grandement facilités.

Le rôle de l'élu ne reste certainement pas — à mon sens — de prendre en charge toutes les responsabilités démocratiques du citoyen : confier sa voie en blanc-seing à un représentant n'a plus de pertinence, puisque chacun est capable de voter. En revanche, les questions de fond (l'économie, par exemple) deviennent plus exigeantes et demandent un investissement en temps que ne peut facilement faire le citoyen : ce travail de l'élu resterait, mais probablement à remanier.

Donc la démocratie directe — étant l'expression du citoyen sans intermédiaire pour construire le cadre législatif — est l'évolution logique qui suit les changements de société. Mais les élus l'entendent globalement différemment, considérant leur travail indispensable. Et vu le carriérisme politique en France, on comprend leur opposition frontale : si demain les 3/4 des politiques doivent se trouver un « vrai travail », beaucoup ne vont pas savoir où aller.

Sie kommt typischerweise von Leuten die sich nicht vorstellen können das manche oder auch viele Dinge einfach nicht im eigenen Einflussbereich liegen oder dass das Gegenüber sich einfach nicht an die Regeln hält und man dann (erstmal) keine Handhabe hat. Gerade für Menschen wie dich habe ich diesen Thread gestartet, weil es eben doch vorkommt dass Menschen von Entwicklungen überfahren werden auf die sie keinen Einfluss haben oder einfach Pech haben. Manchmal halt durchgehend.

Ich mags eigentlich nicht so kleinteilig zu antworten, aber ich gehe mal auf deine Antworten ein. Würde mich interessieren was du nach genauerer Analyse sagst ;)

&gt;Ich hatte auch mal dank eines Freenet Fehlers plötzlich zwei DSL Verträge, die mir über Monate nicht gekündigt wurden und immer eingezogen wurden. Allerdings muss man sich da eben drum kümmern, auch wenn der Fehler nicht bei einem selbst liegt.

Meine Reaktion auf die Falschbuchung war:  
1. Monat: Anruf beim Kundenservice  
2. Monat: Anruf beim Kundenservice, Schreiben an den Kundenservice, Rechnung widersprochen  
3. Monat: Anruf beim Kundenservice, Rücklastschrift  
4. Monat: Schreiben an den Kundenservice, Rücklastschrift, ""Problemlösung auf Kulanz""

Meine Reaktion auf die Forderung nach der Kündigung war:

* Rechnungen einreichen, aus denen hervorgeht dass sowohl Flatrate als auch Call-By-Call Tarif liefen  
* Schriftverkehr einreichen, insbesondere Vergleichsvorschlag und Hinweis auf die doppelten Kosten  
* Erklärung dass ich die Forderung nicht ankenne, mit Bitte um eine detaillierte Kostenaufrechnung seit Beginn der DSL Buchung (nie erhalten)

Das ganze ging an die Telekom selbst, 3 Inkassobüros und die Hausanwälte.  
Für einen gerichtlichen Mahnbescheid muss man leider nicht nachweisen dass die Forderung an sich rechtens ist, sondern nur dass keine Formfehler begangen wurden. Hätte ich mich damals informiert und widersprochen (formlos, 6 Wochen Frist) wäre das Thema wahrscheinlich erledigt gewesen. Das ist der große und meiner Meinung nach einzige Fehler, den ich in diesem Fall begangen habe.

Wie wärst du (abgesehen vom Ende) anders vorgegangen?

&gt;Auch wie du deine Zivi/Militär-Karriere beschreibst, klingt als ob du einfach alles überdramatisierst, igmorierst und dann eskalieren lässt.

Unterstellungen. Ich bin Ende 2005 auf T2 gemustert worden und habe auf dem Fragebogen angegeben Dienst machen und Dienst an der Waffe verweigern zu wollen. Ich wollte 2006 Dienst machen um mich noch ein Jahr orientieren zu können, habe mich im April 2006 erkundigt wie der Stand ist (würde wohl eingezogen werden) und danach nichts mehr gehört.  
**Mein kompletter Jahrgang ist 2006 eingezogen worden,** außer ich.

2006 habe ich im April und Mai ein notwendiges Vorpraktikum für mein Wunschstudium absolviert, hatte die notwendigen Unterlagen bereit um mich einzuschreiben und wurde dann - wörtlich - über Nacht eingezogen. Schreiben am 30. Juni erhalten, Dienstantritt am 01. Juli. Neben mir gab es noch zwei weitere solche Fälle in meiner Kompanie. Selbst mein Hinweis darauf dass ich dienstuntauglich war (hatte damals ne Zahnspange) half erstmal nichts, weil ich erst der Anweisung zu folgen hätte und mich danach immer noch beschweren könne. Mir ist direkt am ersten Tag bescheinigt worden dass ich zeitweise nicht diensttauglich bin (T4). Die Bewerbung durfte ich trotzdem nicht einreichen, da ich formell noch nicht aus dem Dienst entlassen war. Das geschah dann am 17. Juli, Bewerbungsschluss war der 15.

Auch hier die Frage, was hättest du anders gemacht? Mir fällt spontan ein dass Praktikum früher zu absolvieren, aber dazu hatte ich mich zu spät für das gewünschte Studienfach entschieden.

&gt;edit: Gerade noch mal etwas im Thread gelesen. All diese Schulden, die vielleicht noch irgendwie auf irgendwelchen Kredikarten, Konten, Handyverträgen, wasweisich rumgammeln. Du musst dich da wirklich besser organisieren.

Bitte was? Ich habe 4 Gläubiger:

**Telekom:** Oben schon beschrieben.  
**Krankenkasse:** Rückwirkend erhobene Beiträge, meine Krankenkasse hat mir mir dann eine ziemlich moderate Nachzahlung ausgemacht. Das lief auch bis zur Insolvenzeröffnung durch.  
**Kreditkarte:** Tja, ein halbes Jahr arbeitslos ohne nennenswerten Anspruch auf Sozialleistungen ist halt teuer. Hätte ich den Job wie beworben im Juni bekommen wäre es ganz gut gelaufen: 800 € Einkommenssteuerrückzahlung, 1.000 € Wohngeld für 4 Monate und 200 € Ersparnisse standen zur Verfügung. Ich persönlich rechne mit 650 € Minimum pro Monat, also 2.600 € insgesamt von denen 600 € über die Kreditkarte hätten finanziert werden müssen. Davor hatte ich ein Saldo von weniger als 50 €. Nicht schön, aber auch kein Weltuntergang. So waren es dann halt gut 1.400 € Saldo, das ich von Juli bis zum Eröffnung des Insolvenzerfahrens auf ca. 1.200 € abgetragen hatte.  
**BAFöG:** Öhm, ja, BAFöG muss man zur Hälfte zurückzahlen wenn man es bekommt. Ich bin bisher noch nie von jemandem dafür kritisiert werden, von daher ein Novum.

Konten sind alle im Plus (Guthabenkonten), Handyverträge habe ich nicht (Prepaid bei blau.de), Mietschulden sind auch keine da, Kredite sowieso nicht... Wovon sprichst du also bitte?

&gt;Bonusrunde: BAFöG.

Meine Mutter ist 2006 verschwunden und war nicht mehr aufzufinden. Eine Einweisung in die geschlossene Anstalt stand zur Debatte, da Verdacht auf paranoide Schizophrenie bestand.

Ich habe mich aufgrund der Bundeswehrgeschichte oben erst im August 2007 erstmals an einer Universität eingeschrieben. Unterlagen waren im Oktober 2007 alle zusammen (meine damalige Krankenkasse hat Stress gemacht, weil ich aufgrund damals bestehender Regelungen während einem ALG II Bezug selbst versichert war und für das Studium in die Familienversicherung zurück musste). Das nächste Schreiben kam im Dezember 2007 (Mietvertrag war aufs Jahr befristet). Dann nochmal im März 2008 (neues Jahr, neue Verdienstbescheinigung meines Vaters). Auf Nachfrage teilte man mir mit dass zur Überprüfung meiner Angaben Meldeämter angeschrieben werden müssten und Reaktionszeiten von jeweils 12 Wochen zu erwarten seien. Einen vorläufigen Bescheid auf Grundlage meiner Angaben oder eine Auszahlung als Darlehen wollte man nicht machen, bis ich im Sommer 2007 (in Rücksprache mit meinem Vermieter) zwei Monate die Miete nicht zahlte, die fristlose Kündigung erhielt und mit Hinweis auf meine finanzielle und Wohnsituation eine Auskunft zum Stand des Verfahrens forderte.

Auch hier wüsste ich gerne was du anders gemacht hättest.

La frammentazione non esiste è FUD, il termine ha senso solo in contrapposizione con uno scenario apocalittico dove esiste solo un tipo di cellulare. Cosa che nemmeno apple e il suo monopolismo aggressivo riesce a fare (soltato di schermi ormani ne ha almeno 5 tipo diversi ).

Chiunque venga da un ambiente di sviluppo che non sia il drag and drop di ios, non trova nulla di speciale in android, perchè è normale avere hardware differenti.

Qualsiasi designer che non venga da ios, non ha problemi con android, il layout responsivo è la normalità, e si usa anche sul web da decenni.

Se fai una applicazione android, funziona ovunque e la grafica si addatta perfettamente, sia che tu la faccia girare sul cellulare di 4 anni fa, un tablet, la smart tv, un frigo, o un'auto 
http://www.openautoalliance.net/
la velocità è irrilevante, decide l'utente, e non è che su un iphone 4 le applicazioni girano veloci come su un 5s... vabbè ma è apple che le rallenta apposta per fartelo ricomprare.

Non vedrai mai barre nere, perchè è tutto responsivo come è stato il mondo dell'informatica negli ulti 40 anni, ios è la pecora nera, ma su android puoi aggiungere quante viste vuoi per mille tipi di monitor diversi. L'applicazione è sempre UNA e il codice è sempre lo stesso, crei delle viste 
1 2 3, a volte le mostri a gruppi 1 2 - 3, a volte in sequenza 1 - 2 - 3, su una tv tutte assieme 1 2 3, ma il codice è sempre quello. 
Compili UNA volta, fai UNA applicazione e distribuisci OVUNQUE, frammentazione sta cippa. Con ios hai addirittura una frammentazione in fase di sviluppo ipad e iphone. Non ti rendi conto quanto limitato sia ios, e perchè a nessuno è mai importato creare una cosa simile e hanno tutti atteso lo sviluppo hardware.

Se a te serve per forza hardware specifico tipo il bluetooth, setti un flag nella configurazione e chi non ce l'ha non vede nemmeno l'applicazione quando accede al market. Serve il giroscopio basta che clicchi su un checkbox, su ios devi gestire le rogne hardware via codice.

Il fatto stesso che ios7 non faccia girare perfettamente applicazioni compilate per ios6, dimostra che la frammentazione è un problema SOLO SU IOS. Che figate telefonare a 10 clienti e dirgli che devono rispendere soldi perchè adesso l'applicazione non è compatibile con un aggiornamento. Ancora più bello dirgli che devono rispendere soldi perchè devono rifare la grafica o apple non ti fa passare l'applicazione...  giusto le capre seguono il capo gregge asserviti in questa maniera, siamo tornati ai servi della gleba.",0,1401036484,null,0,false,0,chqs81k,t3_26dkwm,t1_chqs81k,t1_chqmp89,null,1433948937,0,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,0

This is wrong. There are many form of identity during the time of nationalism and before then, and were more fluid due to lack of direct observation and categorization. We can see forms of nationalism, tribalism, classism, communalism/secterianism, and things which we might not even recognize today, in various places and at various points in time. Simplifying all those identities into ""tribalism"" does a disservice to the complexity of human relationships throughout history.

true,753861429-951843627,EURO,European Union,"I don't think that's true. I live in a less affluent part of an affluent district of Vienna. I take down racist flyers people tape to the elevator, the entrance door to the house, or the bus station about once a month. I hear people talk when they are walking their dogs or go shopping. 

People are scared of losing cultural primacy in their city. They don't like it that half of the pupils in the local primary school are first generation Austrians, even if they don't have children or even grandchildren in school. This attitude is especially strong towards Turkish and Albanian people; Croats, Czechs, Slovaks, or Serbs seem to face less hostility, or even east Asians. They dislike that there are three specifically Turkish supermarkets in walking distance. They aren't comfortable with not understanding about a third of their neighbours when they talk with each other. They aren't comfortable with Muslims, and they generalise from the negative experiences they have, and that's natural (by which I don't mean ""good"").

These aren't (by and large) well-educated people, or people who have a particularly affluent background. Their understanding of their culture and their place in it is more ""nationalistic""; that isn't really the right word for it, but I can't think of a better word currently. They aren't abnormal. It's quite well established that ""low social standing"" is one of the predictors of heightened threat perception towards immigrants and increased cultural alienation. They feel that the FPOe is the only party that takes their issues seriously and doesn't mock them or talk down to them.

I'm sure many people vote FPOe to express their more general discontent, but many, many people feel that the FPOe is the only party they *can* vote for, because all other parties have completely lost the connection to their lived reality. One neighbour described the SPOe as ""abgehoben"" and ""Partei für die Fremden, nicht uns"". I think that the (again) rising support for the FPOe is indicative of concrete problem besides discontent with the great coalition.

-Aller en fac d'éco même si t'aimes pas pendant un an et bosser le programme de terminale de S sur le côté pour faire ensuite changer l'année d'après.

-Passer ton bac cette année puis faire une terminale S (je suis certain que c'est possible, il y a une fille dans mon lycée qui a passé son bac L l'année dernière mais qui est passée en terminale S cette année et passe encore le bac cette année).

-Demander directement à certains fac si tu peut les intégrer, pas certain qu'il y ait de la place et tu devras travailler encore plus vu que t'auras pas le niveau dans les matières scientifiques mais tu peut toujours essayer.

Nell'empio, come profilo Di Maio è quello governativo, Di Battista quello col manganello. Non hanno proposte loro o un'idea diversa del partito (se le avessero li caccerebbero).

Civati ha un profilo politico spostato a sinistra, guida una correntina minoritaria interna, è contrario ad alcuni provvedimenti sponsorizzati dal suo partito, ma è d'accordo con la collocazione politica e ideologica del PD.

E i partiti veri, quelli democratici e contendibili, hanno modo di fare esprimere queste figure, nei tempi e luoghi predisposti a questo (i congressi e le votazioni interne). In questo modo una che è minoranza, lo ripeto, col tempo e con l'impegno può diventare maggioranza.

E il giorno che l'area civatiana diventasse maggioranza il PD diventerebbe un partito interessante anche per me che non ho mai votato da quelle parti.

* PMP is a new party, made up of PDL members

* Mircea Diaconu is an actor and a former PNL member. He was initially barred from running because he had been found incompatible by the National Integrity Agency, but the court later overturned the ban.

Vi scrivo due robe al volo che ho scoperto, grazie al [topic su Hardware Italia](http://www.hwupgrade.it/forum/showthread.php?p=41131847) che mi ha postato /u/stefantalpalaru che ringrazio:

* La linea puo' arrivare fino a 85 Mbit ma e' tagliata da Fastweb a 60 Mbit. (Ovviamente se la portante e' buona ed il POP vicino). Un giorno forse toglieranno il blocco. L'upload e' 10 Mbit.
* Fastweb e Telecom stanno sperimentando il vectoring, una nuova tecnologia che promette di raggiungere velocita' ancora superiori.
* L'IP pubblico fisso te lo danno senza troppi problemi, basta chiedere al Customer Care o via Facebook.
* La voce per le nuove attivazioni non e' Voip ma e' POTS tradizionale, quindi il telefono non va infilato nel router ma in una presa a muro vecchio stile. Chi e' gia' cliente Fastweb rimane Voip.
* I router piu' comuni sono l'ADB DV2200 ed un Technicolor, entrambi abbastanza fighi, con accesso in telnet e firmware con un sacco di funzioni. Fastweb da l'accesso totale, quindi si possono aprire porte, cambiare configurazioni ed anche renderlo ""trasparente"" per un router in cascata. (http://www.hwupgrade.it/forum/showthread.php?t=2640748).
* Si puo' sostituire il router Fastweb ad un router proprio. I piu' gettonati sono i FritzBox 3390, 7360 o 7390, perche' supportano VDSL ed hanno un sacco di funzioni, ma costano dai 120 in su. I router che supportano il VDSL non sono molti (http://www.fastweb.it/modem/).
* Piu' borchie/porte/prese telefoniche si hanno in casa piu' c'e' il rischio che l'SNR cali e la linea vada piano, perche' il segnale fa tipo il giro di tutte le prese e torna alla principale. Quindi, se ci fossero problemi, scollegate le prese periferiche che non vi servono.
* Per un motivo simile di interferenza fra dati e voce, consigliano di mettere un filtro/splitter anche da pochi euro tra la presa principale ed il router, per dividere dati (router) e voce (telefono).
* Il peer2peer non e' particolarmente filtrato e la gente scarica parecchio veloce.

Una curiosita': [stavo giusto rinnovando la polizza auto, passando da compagnia tradizionale ad online](http://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/25um3w/assicurazioni_rc_auto_online_dove_la_fregatura/) e Fastweb ha una convenzione con Genialloyd, che era quella che mi aveva fatto il preventivo piu' economico. Come cliente Fastweb sono passato addirittura da 550 annuali a 480.

The Two major(and one minor) Pipelines currently in devlopment are TAP and EMP with the minor being the Interconnector Greece-Bulgaria(IGB)

The TAP which will be complete by 2018-2020 will bring Gas from Azerbaijan and could provide up to 15-20% of all Europes Gas needs for nearly a Century.

The EMP Pipeline will bring gas from the Leviathian Gas Basin of Israel/Cyprus and will provide around 10-15%  of EU's Gas needs for just as long. 

Those two things alone will greatly help Greece as Greece currently spends around 8-10% of total GDP to import over-priced Gas/Oil from mainly Russia, so this will free up to 4-5% of GDP. 

The real hope for me though is Greece's potential for its own Gas Reserves within Greek waters, some estimates put the number anywhere from 5, 10,15 or even 20+ Trillion $ of potential reserves. 

What little is known so far is that Crete alone has around 1 Trillion $ minimum of Gas around the island alone . . .this alone will help pay off debt + boost investment in many sectors of Greek economy. 

The only bad part is that we will have to wait until 2020 to start profiting from this . . so next few years will continue to be a bit of a struggle but by 2020 Greece will have an economic boom.

Io mi sono orientato su Genialloyd, che era il preventivo piu' economico ed anche l'unica grossa assicurazione fra quelli piu' economici; gli altri erano Quixa, Zurich, Con Te e Direct Line.

* Polizza infortuni guidatore: copre solo l'invalidita' permanente o la morte. Se mi faccio male, ad esempio mi rompo un braccio, e poi torno totalmente a posto (tie!) Qui sotto un utente diceva comunque ""Quando mi sono rotto la clavicola in un incidente mi hanno riconosciuto il 3% di invalidità. E questo dopo una guarigione perfetta senza alcuno strascico"". In ogni caso, io faccio l'RC auto con Genialloyd ma mi tengo la polizza infortuni personali con Unipol, che copre parecchia altra roba.
* Massimali: i massimali Genialloyd sono 50 milioni persone + 50 milioni cose. Si possono abbassare ma si risparmia poco. Ho visto altri preventivi ed avevano massimali molto piu' bassi, anche 5 e 1.
* Assistenza stradale: sembra fatta bene, se rimani a piedi ti vengono a prendere ecc ecc
* Sconti familiari: se avete un familiare o anche solo un convivente con stesso domicilio (no PACS, no matrimonio), il secondo abbonamento ha un po' di sconto (30 euro dai miei test)
* Percorrenza media: se quella che dichiarate e' meno di quella che fate realmente non dovrebbe succedere niente di grave.
* Se siete clienti Fastweb c'e' uno sconto con Genialloyd abbastanza serio
* Gli unici siti decenti per fare preventivi sono i gia' citati Subito.it e Facile.it. Assicurazioni.it e' sempre Facile.it.

Alla fine ho strappato un preventivo da 480 euro all'anno, massimali 50 + 50, assistenza stradale, tutela rivalse, tutela legale. Niente polizza infortuni, niente polizza cristalli, niente furto incendio.

Prima spendevo 800, quindi 320 euro di risparmio.

L'assicurazione infortuni personale di Unipol costa 120.

Prima era 800 + 120 = 920 ora e' 480 + 120 = 600 euro. Non male.",0,1401041134,null,0,false,0,chqtzqz,t3_25um3w,t1_chqtzqz,t3_25um3w,null,1433949777,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

Nice start, a personal attack. How enlightened of you.

Praised be the dear leader! For he will guide us into the light of Norwegian Wealth!

This is what creates that elusive European identity and also where Europe outdoes the other unions of countries and federations. We have the freedom and technology to do this. And we also have the political and fiscal incentive. Things like a common currency, freedom of movement and trade inside Schengen space. Also, things like the knowledge exchange in this sub is great and very positive. When I was young, we'd exchange with other European students via EU programs. It was very slow and not very effective, unlike today. But it was a great start nevertheless.

It's not obvious yet but the UDI has more and more support among local elects, especially in the west (where they don't like extremists of either side), which is essential to leading national campaigns and getting senators (and which is the FN's main weakness).

Results will arrive from 10pm, so for now, it's mostly just semi-informed speculations from party officials. 

Participation rate is abysmal, as of 18.30 it was 27.62%, so the overall participation will surely be below 30. This basically cements the big win (13 or 14 mandates out of 21) for Fidesz.  ~~It's also helping the smaller leftist/central parties: LMP (greens)'s entrance is to be surer than in the parliamentary elections a month ago, possibly reaching even 6%. Együtt-PM, former PM Bajnai's party and DK, former PM Gyurcsány's party are toe to toe, only one of them is expected to secure enough votes for a mandate (or worst case scenario for them: neither of them will).~~

~~Jobbik and the Socialists will likely underperform because of the low-turnout. A Jobbik official stated they are expecting 1-2% lower results than in the parliamentary elections, which means ~18%.~~

Also: Slovakians, how did you manage to get a 13% participation rate? 

-----
EDIT: Okay, forget everything I said previously. Party sources, claiming information based on near 100% processing:

~~Fidesz-KDNP 53,51  | 13  
Jobbik 15,22   |   3   
MSZP 11,13   |   2   
DK 8,97   |   2   
Együtt-PM 6,13   |   1~~   
   
   
~~LMP 4,49   |   0~~   

Gyurcsány's party is exceeding expectation tremendously, they are beating the Socialists in many voting districts.

The president of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, seeks to make our flesh creep with his vision of ‘political extremes and populism tearing apart the social fabric’. Jean-Claude Juncker, the ultimate Brussels insider, who recently stepped down after 18 years as prime minister of Luxembourg, is so alarmed that he foresees another Great War: ‘I am chilled by the realisation of how similar the crisis of 2013 is to that of 100 years ago.’*",0,1401045529,null,0,false,0,chqvoah,t3_26gp5u,t1_chqvoah,t3_26gp5u,null,1433950740,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

Mais je connais un ES qui est parti en licence physique/maths à l'UPMC et ça ce passe plutôt bien pour lui, il pourra même tenter les admissions sur titre a la fin de sa L2/L3 pour devenir ingénieur.

Pour ce qui est du travail, je l'ai un peu coaché, le plus important c'est de voir maths/physique. Prend un manuel et bosse tranquillement ça pendant tes vacances avant la rentrée, si t'es motivé tu seras logiquement meilleur qu'au moins la moitié de ta promo.

Je complète un peu ma réponse au vue des autres commentaires. 2 mois pour rattraper ce que tout élève de S est supposé apprendre en 10 mois, ça peut parraître insurmontable, mais en réalité faut pas oublier que les 3/4 des élèves en S sont pas autant motivé que toi, enfin je l'espère, et que en plus les cours sont ce qu'ils sont, tu seras normalement plus efficace à la maison. Il y a plein de chaines youtube qui donnent des cours de maths niveau terminale, et refaire une année de terminale S serait à mon avis une perte de temps.

Concernant mon pote qui est rentré en L1 cette année je me souviens que sa fac lui a proposé une remise a niveau pendant l'été, en plus des cours de physique/maths qu'il avait commencé à rattraper début juin. Si ton niveau est pas mauvais en ES, je te conseille de faire ça et de SURTOUT PAS perdre une année à redoubler et revoir plein de matières qui feront doublon. Au pire tu peux passer ton bac S en candidat libre et prendre tes anciennes notes aux matières communes pour tes nouvelles notes de bac S, ça te rendra inéligible à une mention, mais tu pourras avoir un bac S l'année prochaine à la fin de ta L1 si tu le souhaite vraiment ;)

But turnout? No, probably not. There would be fewer people to pay attention to, but that's not the main reason behind low turnout in my mind. The European elections and the EU are just not considered to be important to the lives of French people.  The fact that we're discussing this at all means we have followed the elections or are concerned in some way. Many average people just are NOT concerned in France, even those who always vote for their local and the presidential elections. The high abstention reflects this, but also reflects a lack of feeling like the candidates represent one's views. If 80% of French voters had voted and the election results were the same for the FN, they would have a legitimate victory. But they could never obtain such a victory.

C'est pareil pour l'Europe: on se focalise (et c'est normal) sur le négatif, mais on oublie souvent de parler des choses qui fonctionnent. Je suis le premier à reconnaître les difficultés de l'Europe, mais il faut arrêter d'être dans la mauvaise foi et reconnaître que la CEE puis l'UE ont apporté énormément de choses positives:

* La paix

On l'oublie souvent mais c'était pourtant l'une des raisons principales du processus européen. Depuis 75 ans, nous n'avons pas connu de guerre entre les principales nations européennes. C'est aujourd'hui une hypothèse inconcevable, alors qu'elle pouvait souvent relever du probable au début du siècle. 

* La PAC

Oui, je considère la PAC comme une réussite de l'Europe. Elle doit être réformée aujourd'hui, et répondre aux réalités économiques des pays européens. Mais la PAC nous a permis d'être autosuffisants, et d'éradiquer la famine en Europe. Faut-il rappeler que les tickets de rationnement étaient encore en vigueur en France jusqu'au milieu des années 1950?

* La normalisation

Le chargeur universel. Les règles d’étiquetage. Normes de sécurité sur les biens. Procédures de protection des consommateurs (échanges, garanties, etc.). Les exemples sont nombreux et visibles au quotidien sans forcément qu'on s'en rende compte.

* La protection des droits de l'homme

La CJUE est une avancée fondamentale que je vous laisse apprécier [ici](http://goo.gl/fJLa7f) ou si vous êtes très curieux, [ici](http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/)

* Le rattrapage économique

Le FEDER a permis aux régions périphériques de l'Union (l'Espagne, le Portugal, l'Irlande puis les PECO) de financer leur développement. Si nous sommes encore en crise à l'heure actuelle, tout le monde ne peut pas en dire [autant](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=fr&amp;pcode=tec00115). Les Pays Baltes connaissent de forts taux de croissance, comme la Pologne ou la Roumanie.

* Autres

Erasmus, Airbus, Europol, etc.

Piazza Navona- 100% amazing, just around the corner is the best pizza place i know and its called Da francesco's, only opens at 7 every night and there is always a short line, but they will find room for two! - hopefully you are there for the night..

Anyways.. if you are there for a day i would do a walking tour, everything is surprisingly close. I would hit Colosseum, Typewriter (Vittorio de emanuel), Then move up to Piazza Navona, Trevi fountain (spectacular at night), then spanish steps, and lastly: piazza de popolo- when you look to the right when you get there you will find villa de borghese and the best view int he house if you go up there

There is so much to see for just one day. But i'd recommend most piazza Navona and Da francesco if you can make dinner. Otherwise for sure the typewriter and the borghese gardens for the view of rome. 

Sorry for the muddled response. But search a few of these up and see what you like! ask if you want any more info its limited but i am here at the moment!

true,darkXdrei,null,null,"Ich würde mich auch als Liberal bezeichnen und bin meistens auch FDP Wähler. Das FDP-Bashing hat meiner Meinung mehrere Gründe: 

1. **Die Schuldzuweisung für die Finanzkrise.**  
Im Zuge der Finanzkrise wurde die Schuld dem unregulierten Finanzsystem und dem Neoliberalismus zugeschrieben, welcher mit der FDP gleichgesetzt wurde. (Obwohl der Liberalismus soetwas wie die Bankenrettung ja verneint hätte.)

2. **Lobbyismus Vorwürfe.**   
Die Mehrwertsteuersenkung für Hoteliers die von der FDP durchgedrückt wurde und der vorangegangenen Spende durch die Mutterfirma derMövenpick Hotelgruppe. Hierzu muss ich sagen, dass ich die Aktion auch absolut Banane fand. Merkwürdig, aber dass die CSU welche eine ähnlich hohe Spende erhalten hatte dafür so gut wie gar nicht kritisiert wurde. Dumm war auf jeden Fall auch die Uneinsicht der FDP Funktionäre, die trotz gewaltiger öffentlicher Kritik die Spende nicht zurückzahlen wollten.

3. **Das Personal**  
Zunächst der Aggressive und oftmals unsympathische Westerwelle, der auch gerne mal von einer spät Römischen Dekadenz unter Hartz 4 Empfängern spricht. Als nächstes der relativ gesichtslose Lindner-Platzhalter Philipp Rösler der bei der Schlecker Pleite Gefühlskalt von einer Anschlussverwertung der MitarbeiterInnen sprach. (Obwohl ich finde, dass die Entscheidung richtig war, nur eben schlecht rübergebracht)
Und zuletzt Spitzenkandidat Rainer Brüderle mit seinem sexisitischem ""Sie können ein Dirndl auch ausfüllen."".

Zu guter Letzt möchte ich noch darauf Hinweisen, dass, laut einer Studie der FU Berlin, knapp 50% der Journalisten  einer Linken Partei nahe stehen(Quelle: [Seite 13](https://www.dfjv.de/documents/10180/178294/DFJV_Studie_Politikjournalistinnen_und_Journalisten.pdf) ). Muss nicht unbedingt etwas bedeuten, kann man aber nebenbei notieren.

Allgemein hoffe ich, dass Lindner es schafft die FDP wieder zu einer wirklich Liberalen Kraft in Deutschland umzufunktionieren. Ich halte dies für Wichtig, nicht nur weil der Liberalismus eben zu meiner Welteinstellung passt, sondern damit es im Bundestag wenigstens eine Partei gibt, die dem Staat kritisch gegenübersteht, und weniger Macht für diesen verlangt.

Dazu muss die FDP den Liberalismus jedoch konsequenter durchziehen.

Je suis victime d'un épuisement électoral : j'ai toujours voté pour les écolos, dont les dirigeants ont constemment prouvés qu'ils n'étaient pas là pour l'écologie et avaient surtout un appétit pour le pouvoir. Pas envie de voter pour les autres partis, trop arcés sur leurs dogmes (le FdG et ses discours passéistes jusque dans le langage lui-même) ou trop embourbés dans les compromissions en tous genres (qu'est-ce que le pS a encore de socialiste ?). Au parlement européen, les lobbyistes sont rois, et c'est le même genre de chose qui se passe au parlement français. Résultat, je ne suis représenté par personne, et jamais mon vote blanc ne sera reconnu.

Depuis 2002, on nous sert sans arrêt le vote utile et le barrage, et les gens de gauche sont largement les plus prompts à le faire. Les gens de droite attendent gentiment notre concours, et ils l'ont, vu que la droite gagne quand même plus d'élections et qu'on déteste l'extrême-droite, sentiment bien plus mitigé chez les gens en bleu.

Donc c'est sans moi, marre de servir de caution politique à des gens que je ne respecte pas et qui en ont autant à mon encontre, tout en me faisant malgré tout les yeux doux pour un bulletin. Il est temps que les conneries du genre ""vote de protestation"", ""vote utile"" et autres disparaissent. Que les gens se mettent à assumer leur vote et qu'on arrête de les excuser. S'ils veulent le FN, qu'ils l'aient, puisque ça a l'air d'être la seule manière de leur faire capter.

PS : désolé, c'est un peu le bazar, mais voilà. Et ce que je dis, c'est un sentiment partagé par pas mal de gens qui ne sont pas allés voter consciemment et avec qui j'ai évoqué le sujet.

true,King_of_Avalon,EURO,Croatia,"&gt; European history is intertwined like a Gordian knot.

This is a point I've always tried to make to eurosceptics in the UK who seem to view the UK in some sort of glorious isolation. The fact of the matter is that, up until *very* recently, all European countries were defined by their interactions with others. The UK is the UK *precisely because* France is France, and Germany is Germany, and Belgium is Belgium. All of these countries are the results of their interactions with each other, and their identities are defined by the way in which they've collided and shaped each other over the course of history.

Only recently with the EU has this begun to change, and rather than European countries being defined by their historical differences, it's more about their commonalities that are the driving force shaping their modern identities, especially in places with less-than-stellar modern history ^*ahem* ^^*Germany*. Therefore, to me, the European Union is in fact a testament to the modern intertwined relationships between European countries, and trying to untangle this and view each country as its own God-ordained unique and distinct entity is to completely deny the realities of both historical conflict and modern economics.

(If Dr. Stubb gets elected as the chairman of his party, it can be expected that he will be replaced in the Europarl with [Petri Sarvamaa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_Sarvamaa), a current MEP.)

The fourth is Social Democrats with two candidates, [Liisa Jaakonsaari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liisa_Jaakonsaari) (a current MEP and a member of the right-leaning wing of her party) and Miapetra Kumpula-Natri (chairwoman of the Grand Commitee of the Finnish parliament, i.e. kind of ""upper house lite"", also in charge of EU affairs in the parliament).

Fifth comes Leftist Alliance, returning to the Europarl with Merja Kyllönen, the recently resigned Minister of Transport.

Sixth, Greens (losing one seat) with [Heidi Hautala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi_Hautala), profiled on environmental protection and human rights.

Maybe that's just my personal opinion but I would never vote for a right wing party that is openly xenophobic. There's nothing that would ever push me into the claws of racism and intolerance. I'd probably even cut ties with friends who voted for a fascist party.  I could be unemployed, kicked and being pushed towards suicide by a corrupt government led by police brutality and yet I would never vote for fascism. Today's election doesn't show that French citizens are fed up with their government. It shows that French citizens would vote for hatred and bigotry and prejudice if it could make them content.    
I'd rather accept my own mistakes rather than blaming it on Brussels or a random Moroccan neighbor. Hollande might understand this message but the rest of the world will see French people as idiots who vote for fascism in a democracy.  
This isn't going to solve anything.  It only makes you guys look stupid (as a collective even though many people are sane). 
France might not have the same history regarding fascism like Germany, Italy or Spain but is it that hard to pick up a history book and read about the ""-ism"" that they are going to vote for?  
Sorry if this sounds harsh. I know many French people aren't like that and it's still a minority but I feel ashamed to live on the same continent as fascists. Especially Europe should know better why it's a dumb move to vote for xenophobia.  Politics is no joke. There's nothing edgy about voting for fascists to show Hollande that he's wrong.

Non : [voir ici](http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/mav/129/ROBERT/49143).

La paix ? Laissons la parole à l’ancien député et toujours très européen Jean-Louis Bourlanges : « Ce n’est pas l’Europe qui a fait la paix ; c’est la paix qui a fait l’Europe. » Si elle scelle la réconciliation franco-allemande, la construction communautaire s’inscrit en effet dans l’ensemble atlantique, et son essor est inséparable de la guerre froide. Les « pères fondateurs » (Jean Monnet, Paul-Henri Spaak, Konrad Adenauer, Alcide De Gasperi, etc.) étaient tous atlantistes, voire alignés sur les politiques américaines (Monnet et Schuman étaient d'ailleurs financés par la CIA.

&gt;La PAC

On donne 20 milliards d'euros à l'UE et elle rend à la France 13 milliards (dont 10 milliards de PAC). Avec les mêmes montants on aurait pu avoir la même autosuffisance.

&gt;Faut-il rappeler que les tickets de rationnement étaient encore en vigueur en France jusqu'au milieu des années 1950?

Déjà c'est uniquement jusqu'en [1949](http://www.nithart.com/fr39-45.htm). Ensuite faut-il rappeler qu'il y a eu la seconde guerre mondiale avec l'occupation des Allemands et la séparation de la France en deux ?

En plus c'est débile, la PAC n'a été mise en place qu'à partir de [1962](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politique_agricole_commune)...

Encore une fois, avec ou sans UE on aurait fait pareil, voire mieux.

&gt;La normalisation

Le MRM a pour principe de base le rejet des normes de genre qui affectent les hommes, la croyance que le pouvoir judiciaire est biaisé contre les hommes et le combat contre les mouvements féministes. Quand je parle de biais du système judiciaire, les éléments avancés par les MRA sont le fait que les hommes prennent des peines plus lourdes pour les mêmes crimes, perdent très souvent la garde de leurs enfants même si ils ne sont pas en tort, et le fait que les hommes accusés de viol ou de violence sexuelle sont souvent condamnés même en absence de preuve. J'ignore quelle est la véracité de leurs affirmations, a fortiori en France. Il y a bien entendu beaucoup de vrais misogynes parmi les MRA. *Disclaimer: Je sympathise avec certaines idées du MRM, même si l'idée de combattre le féminisme est ridicule*.

Les Redpillers sont un mouvement anti-féministe, mais qui prône plutôt un renforcement des normes de genre, disant que les hommes doivent contrôler, dominer les femmes. Pour justifier ça, ils utilisent différentes statistiques et exemples souvent faussés pour affirmer que les femmes sont naturellement plus bêtes et moins matures que les hommes, et ont besoin d'hommes pour les remettre dans le droit chemin. Un vrai homme pour les Redpillers est le seul à travailler dans sa famille, sa femme est à son service et il n'hésite pas à la battre si elle s'affirme trop. Aussi, une femme doit être vierge à son mariage, mais les hommes doivent ""baiser"" autant de ""salopes"" que possible pour s'affirmer.

Les PUA sont une vague mouvance nébuleuse dont le seul objectif est de ""séduire"" (= coucher avec) des femmes en utilisant plusieurs techniques. Ils n'ont pas d'agenda au-delà de ça. Plusieurs PUA sont des Redpillers.

Les Redpillers et les MRA ne s'entendent pas. Là où un MRA te dira ""Les hommes ont aussi le droit d'être des enseignants de maternelle sans qu'on les accuse d'être des violeurs!!"" un Redpiller répondra ""Pourquoi tu veux faire ce boulot de femmelette? Va t'engager dans l'armée et trouve toi une femme pour te faire à manger, pédé!"" Tu vois ce que je veux dire?

&gt;The __American Nazi Party__ (ANP) was an American [political party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party) founded by [George Lincoln Rockwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lincoln_Rockwell). Headquartered in [Arlington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Virginia), [Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia), Rockwell initially called it the __World Union of Free Enterprise National Socialists__ (WUFENS), but later renamed it the American Nazi Party in 1960 to attract maximum media attention.  The party was based largely upon the ideals and policies of [Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler)'s [NSDAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSDAP) in [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) during the [Third Reich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Reich) but also expressed allegiance to the [Constitutional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States) principles of the U.S.'s Founding Fathers. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] It also espoused [Holocaust denial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_denial).

Immigration is positive, because it brings new impulses and creates cross-pollination of ideas and values.

 88 pour cent des électeurs français ne font pas confiance aux partis politiques. Le FN c'est pas un parti politique ? L'abstention fait plus de chiffres que le FN. Et l'échec de Marine Lepen à rafler le gros de cette abstention montre que non, les français ne se sont pas droitisés avec la crise.

Les vrais beaufs, ceux qui ont droitisé la société, ce sont nos dirigeants.

C'est Valls, qui entend réduire drastiquement le coût des salaires et l'impôt sur les sociétés et diminuer les dépenses publiques à hauteur de 50 milliards d'euros.

Ce sont les puissants courants de l'UMP qui veulent s'allier avec le FN, craignant de devoir faire face à ce parti aux élections présidentielles.

Ce sont les trotskystes (LO, NPA, ""Ensemble""...), qui ont soutenus toutes les guerres impérialistes menées par le gouvernement, auquel le peuple s'est opposé dans les sondages et dans la rue. Ils ont fournit une couverture de ""gauche"" a ces guerres.

L'élite dirigeante française a besoin de l'extrême-droite pour intimider la classe ouvrière et réprimer toute opposition à ses mesures d'austérité et à sa politique de guerre. Sa collaboration avec les fascistes de Svoboda et de Secteur Droit (Pravyy Sektor) à Kiev pour installer au pouvoir un régime de droite, pro-UE en Ukraine est un avertissement à cet égard.

La vrai situation, c'est le contraire de ce que l'OP titre: La honte de la France, ce ne sont pas ses électeurs qui n'avaient guère le choix, puisqu'ils étaient confronté a une pléthore de listes de droite, et aucune liste de gauche sérieuse.

Switzerland is actually a bad example for what you want, but EU-sceptics don't see that because their entire reasoning comes down to ""Look at Switzerland! They are doing fine without the EU! See? You are better off without the EU!"". The one question you guys don't ask: Is Switzerland doing well because they are not in the EU or despite they are not in the EU?

Switzerland is that closely tied with the EU, that they are almost part of the EU. They participate in almost everything EU-skeptics hate about the EU, except for the Euro. And they can't just cherry-pick the benefits and dodge the liabilities. The pay billions of Franc to the EU, and they are bound to may EU-regulations just like an EU-member. The Swiss can't do what they want. They resolutions often collide with EU-law or their treaties with the EU.

Switzerlands relationship with EU is aimed at dampening the side-effects of not being part of the EU, which is achieved through hundreds of treaties and agreements, that - as I said above - tie Switzerland very closely to the EU. And no, Switzerland did not do well during the crisis. The Swiss Franc has skyrocketed compared with the Euro, which harmed their trade with their biggest export-partner: The EU! The end-result was that they have tied the France with the Euro.

It's very similar in Romania. We were also taught that the ottomans held us back centuries. 

Once you start understanding history as a continuum instead of a tool for local nationalism, you will find out that many facts presented as truth are actually twisted to support a nationalistic narrative.

The ones under discussion here actually do have Cypriot passports. Normally, to vote you also need to register separately (it's a bureaucratic thing) but there was an exception specifically for Turkish Cypriots who live in the north: they can vote without extra steps. All Cypriots living in the South do have to register.

What actually happened here is that the civil servants compiling the lists made a mistake for about 30000 of them and registered their address as in the south. This was accidentally discovered two days ago, thus impossible to fix.

So there's no ambiguity about them being eligible to vote. It's just an epic administrative fuck up (unless it's on purpose but I doubt it). And the government's reaction is completely unacceptable.

Oui. Le rapprochement des pays européens à travers la CECA puis la CEE nous a évité une nouvelle guerre, et le rapprochement des populations européennes, notamment à travers les programmes comme Erasmus, rend cette hypothèse inconcevable.

&gt; On donne 20 milliards d'euros à l'UE et elle rend à la France 13 milliards (dont 10 milliards de PAC). Avec les mêmes montants on aurait pu avoir la même autosuffisance.

C'est le principe, qui fonctionne de manière similaires avec les autres fonds, comme le FEDER ou le FEOGA. On finance à hauteur de ses richesses, et on reçoit à hauteur de ses besoins. 

&gt; Déjà c'est uniquement jusqu'en 1949.

Autant pour moi.

&gt; Ensuite faut-il rappeler qu'il y a eu la seconde guerre mondiale avec l'occupation des Allemands et la séparation de la France en deux ? En plus c'est débile, la PAC n'a été mise en place qu'à partir de 1962 ... Encore une fois, avec ou sans UE on aurait fait pareil, voire mieux.

Tant que l'efficacité des boules de cristal sera mise en doute, impossible d'affirmer avec certitude ce genre de choses. Peut-être aurait-on pu faire pareil, mais aurions-nous eu les mêmes moyens? Les Etats-Unis figurent au premier rang des subventions agricoles. Je doute fort que l'agriculture française aient pu résister longtemps face au géant américain (dont les pieds sont d'ailleurs en argile).

&gt; Parmi lesquelles un ensemble de pleins de règles inutiles et faites en faveur des lobbies dont l'influence est primordiale à Bruxelles.

Le système est loin d'être parfait. Comme partout, on trouve des abus qui obscurcissent nettement le tableau. Même si on peut considérer l'influence des lobbies comme néfaste, certaines mesures existent pour les contrôler. On trouve le [*registre de transparence*](http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/info/homePage.do?locale=fr) qui permet d'accéder à la liste de l'ensemble des lobbies présents à Bruxelles. Lorsqu'on s'y intéresse, on constate qu'il n'y a pas que les grandes et méchantes multinationales, mais aussi un nombre infinitésimal d'associations ou d'ONG, ainsi que des collectivités territoriales, des universités, etc. Tout le monde pratique le lobbying à Bruxelles, avec des moyens différents et des zones qui demeurent dans l'ombre, certes mais certains outils sont à disposition de potentiels chiens de garde. 

&gt; Oui, c'est pas mal quand on a des gouvernements qui ne respectent pas les droits de l'homme.

C'est vrai que les droits fondamentaux sont violés quotidiennement en France comme dans le reste de l'Europe. La *Police politique* fait régner l'ordre dans les rues et les chaumières, tandis que les tentatives de manifestation sont réprimées dans la violence et le sang. La situation des droits de l'homme dans l'Union peut évidemment s'améliorer, en particulier dans des pays comme la Hongrie ou la Grèce tandis que certains droits doivent continuer à être protégés, mais il faut arrêter de grossir volontairement le trait: nos gouvernements respectent globalement les droits de l'homme et l'Etat de droit.

&gt; Pour la France, c'est en fait l'inverse : http://russeurope.hypotheses.org/2279[4]  
On serait en meilleure situation sans l'UE.

Oui, c'est la faute de l'Euro. C'est la faute de l'UE. C'est beaucoup trop facile. La principale est raison est surtout due à la médiocrité de nos dirigeants politiques depuis plusieurs décennies. Aucune prise de risque, aucune réforme de grande ampleur, aucune vision d'avenir, rien. Nos gouvernements successifs sont réactifs au lieu d'être actifs. On s’accommode de la situation actuelle, on limite le changement, on négocie des accords *a minima* avec les vétos institutionnels qu'incarnent les syndicats et la bureaucratie. 

&gt; Comme ceux qui n'ont pas l'euro ?

La Lituanie a rejoint l'Euro le 1er janvier dernier. Sa monnaie, le *lats*, était liée à la monnaie unique depuis 2005 dans le Mécanisme de change européen (MCE), où les variations des monnaies nationales par rapport à l'Euro sont contrôlées pour être dans une zone de variation inférieure à 15%. Entre 2005 et 2007, la Lettonie a connu un taux de croissance à deux chiffres, avant d'accuser une récession sévère de 17% en 2009. Depuis 2011, la croissance tourne autour des 4-5% annuels.

Il n'y a pas besoin d'être un génie pour apercevoir les limites et le caractère choquant de la Red Pill (la terminologie est ridicule et ne peut qu'aliéner les outsiders), mais je me permets de faire l'avocat du diable deux secondes. La Red Pill est avant tout une vision du monde selon laquelle il existe des différences fondamentales de fonctionnement entre hommes et femmes. Pour rencontrer du succès avec la gente féminine, le Redpiller estime qu'il faut utiliser un certain nombre de techniques et améliorer son statut social, vu comme un élément indispensable de ce qui attire les femmes. Je n'ai jamais entendu un seul redpiller cautionner la violence conjugale et d'ailleurs le mariage est proscrit donc je doute qu'un redpiller veuille entretenir une femme qui ne travaille pas.

On peut concilier les deux sans contradiction. Je souhaite sincèrement le rejet des normes sexuées au niveau de la société et je veux une meilleure prise en compte des problèmes masculins. D'un autre côté, sans que cette analyse soit vraie d'une manière absolue, force est de constater que la plupart des filles que j'ai rencontrées dans ma vie se comportent d'une manière compatible avec la doctrine Redpill. 

Certaines personnes ne peuvent que mépriser ou ignorer la Redpill car ils le sont déjà sans le savoir, mais moi je suis naturellement un mec assez passif, ce qui est LE défaut qu'on ne tolère pas à un mec. Même si j’étais bien intentionné dans mes relations j'étais trop gentil, trop disponible, trop conciliant et au final j'allais dans le mur avec la manière dont je gérais ça. Coïncidence ou non, j'ai constaté une amélioration nette de ma vie sentimentale et personnelle à partir du moment où j'ai pris les choses en charge et où j'ai arrêté de me laisser marcher dessus.

Avec 25% des suffrages potentiels et avec approximativement 54% d'abstention, environ 6 millions de français, soit 13,5% des inscrits sur les listes électorales et 9% de la population totale, ont voté pour le Front Nationale. En 2012, 6,4 millions de français avaient voté pour Marine Le Pen au 1er tour.

Dans ces conditions, je crois qu'il est difficile de pouvoir affirmer que ce vote est celui de tous les Français. En pourcentages, on constate certes une progression mais en valeur absolue, c'est une stagnation. On voit peut-être ici les limites de la politique de séduction du Front national, qui n'arrive pas à franchir un palier dans l'électorat.

Every single blessed day, in the news, you hear ""ex [insert party] senator arrested for tax evasion/mafia ties/other. Most have always escaped a fair judicial process because of their status. At the same time, there is virtually nothing to tie these old parties to the ideas they should/used to represent.

My mother has voted for the centre-left parties for 40 years. In this election she voted M5S, the scary populists, because ""At least they're clean"". My father has always voted for right wing parties, but this time around he voted for the populists because ""There's no right wing anymore, Berlusconi killed it"". 

The main concern for voters in the last elections here has not been a long-term plan for Italy, or a reflection upon European matters. It has simply been a gut reaction from many of the voters, i.e. *not* voting those who have proven time and time again to be corrupt, greedy and incompetent, and voting instead for those who are only incompetent. Not because there is a belief they will be much much better, but simply because if you're given a transparent box with a load of shit in it, and a non-transparent box which *may* contain shit, you choose the latter every time.

Le budget de l’asile représente un coût en progression constante (+27% en 2011, à 376 millions d’euros). → What does our Constitution say ? « 4. Tout homme persécuté en raison de son action en faveur de la liberté a droit d'asile sur les territoires de la République. »

• - Suppression du droit du sol et réforme en profondeur du code de la nationalité française afin que l’acquisition de la nationalité ne soit plus une simple formalité administrative : être français est un honneur. → It goes against everything France has stood for since the Revolution, about how we see citizenship. It's not anti-immigrant by itself, but it's obviously  anti-France.

• - Les manifestations de clandestins ou de soutien aux clandestins seront interdites. → Probably the worst (for the english speakers here : It forbids people to march in favor of illegal immigrants) of them all. Plus everything that goes with hit (impossible to naturalize an illegal, for exemple) is clearly anti-immigrants, because it attacks the core of the moral support they got.

Is this enough for you ? And it's just their ""Immigrantion"" part, I wouldn't dare to expose all the anti-immigrants agenda that they spread in the rest of their program.

Es ist nicht gerechte Ordnung, wenn ein Vater sich ""ganz sicher"" ist und daraus ableitet, dass er sowas tun darf. Verständlich sind diese Rachegefühle, klar. Aber es bleibt eben Rache, die für niemanden einen Gewinn gebracht hat, schon gar nicht für die Gesellschaft. (**Nachtrag**: Ja, korrekt, *der Vater* war in diesem Fall nicht der Rachsüchtige. Wie der Straftäter aber von den Entführern zugerichtet wurde spricht Bände.)

Die Frage an der Stelle ist vor allem wieso die Justiz so versagen konnte (wenn der Fall denn wirklich so klar war wie hier geschildert). Allein schon weil sich so ein Fall hätte wiederholen können.

Da versteht man dann auch, wieso Opferorganisationen die Todesstrafe fordern und Selbstjustiz notfalls verteidigen.

Oh. Halt.

Keine seriöse Opferschutzorganisation tut das. Keine mir bekannte zumindest, und ich nehme an mit gutem Grund nicht. Auf Journalisten, zornige Mitbürger und NPD-Politiker, die  mir dann erzählen wollen dass diese ""Gutmenschen"" (welche als einzige tatsächlich nahe an diesem Thema arbeiten) keine Ahnung hätten und sowieso viel zu weich gegenüber den ""Sexschweinen"" wären kann ich auch verzichten, diese Leute behindern permanent ernsthafte Präventionsprogramme.

But it's still a dumb thing to do. If you don't like Hollande you don't go ahead and vote for the first moron who claims to have the perfect solution - xenophobia.   
You aren't protesting tax increase by voting for fascists. This simply doesn't work. 

&gt;Also insulting a whole country from your high horse

Not voting for a right wing nutjob makes me arrogant? You say that anti-fascists judging French voting behavior are judging from their high horses?  
If that's the case I'll gladly saddle my ""high"" horse because I'd be proud to not vote for fascists.   If you vote for them that's your own responsability. I don't have to tell anybody in the future that I casted my vote for fascists back in 2014.     

&gt;makes me want to punch you in the face

Well, thank god that you live in a different country, am I right? Go ahead and focus your anger on local anti-fascists.  Must be hard to realize that voting for Le Pen is a stupid thing to do.  And since you are bringing in my nationality: It must be even harder to be lectured by an Italian that voting pro-fascism is a bad thing.  If the majority of Italians favored Mussolini in the 20s this doesn't mean that they were all fascists (I never claimed that 1/4th of French citizens were fascist) but all of them were still dumb people.  
Is it that hard to understand that voting for a neo-fascist party is a bad thing? Regardless of the economical situation in France? Even Greece didn't give their fascist party a majority.   It's hard to take a protest serious if you side with crazy people.    
Look at every major newspaper in the world. Every paper will condemn the French election.  A majority for a fascist party portrays a wrong image of France. It's our (European) ideal of democracy after all. Seeing the 1st major republic vote like this is awful. It's also insulting towards the big share of French people who voted for normal parties. I never said that France is fascist - I simply criticized that the majority (of the small share that went to the elections) voted for a stupid party.   Don't treat the EP elections like a joke. You just gave fascists more than 20 votes. It might be a nice ""protest"" now and Hollande might change something but how is this helping the EU?   
The French presidential elections are in 2017 (if Hollande doesn't resign). Even if you guys are able to vote for a better president the EP will have to live with ~20 fascists until 2019. 2 years after Hollande might have been elected out of office. How is this a good thing?  What does today's vote have to do with European politics in 2017, 2018 and 2019?   
It's a selfish vote. Selfish regarding foreigners, selfish towards your other French citizens, selfish towards decent parties in France and selfish towards Europe. Therefore it's also a selfish act towards all the other 27 member states of the EU because they'll have to live with 20 fascists in Brussels after France recovers from the recession and after France elects a new parliament and a new president.

Konservative 9,2% - 1 MEP

Liberal Alliance (Libertarians) 2,9% 0 MEP

Danish Peoples Party 26,7% - 4 MEP

The winner of tonight is the Danish Peoples Party and their frontrunner Morten Messerschmidt. They doubled their number of MEP’s from last election, won the most votes overall. First time in a long while in Danish politics that the “establishment”, the center parties, have suffered such a defeat.

The party worst off is Venstre (Liberal), which seems to lose one of its MEP’s. Many are blaming the scandals surrounding their party leader, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, regarding his ability to mix personal and public finances with regards to traveling, buying clothes and other things. Just a few months ago his party was nearing 30% in domestic polls, so the 16% result tonight is a big defeat for the opposition leader.

There's a reason why the scepticism towards the EU is rising and blaming it solely on the debt crisis is being ignorant (**not that you said that but in general**). There are key issues that the EU needs to address even if they don't seem to want to, for the tide to change.

* 1. Immigration. 

This is a burning subject in most EU member states and no one seems to want to touch it. It's about time we sit down and take this discussion seriously. We're bursting through the seams with, in many cases not integrable immigrants, that push our welfare systems to the limit. This while many european countries cannot even provide for their own. Let alone that immigration is all too often said to be a must because of labour shortage which in the situation we are in is ludicrous. Something needs to happen. Clear rules on immigration for all member states is a huge priority.


* 2. The powers the EU should and shouldn't have.

People are feeling frustration when they feel that their ability to decide over their own faith is taken away from them. With EU presidents and what not being selected and not voted by them to represent them makes people feel neglected. Hence there needs to be a decision made on what the people actually want the EU to be. Here in /r/europe it might at times sound like an EU federation is what everyone wants but that really isn't the case. Just the recent results from this election goes to show that.

* 3. Problem member states

Probably the trickiest of them all. Some member states just aren't pulling their weight and aren't ready for being members. No matter what you individually think it is a question that needs to be addressed. The EU needs its key players and at the moment there's more than a little unhappiness towards these member states from these key states. Do we want the EU to survive or not. One thing is for sure and that is, that without all the key member states the EU will fail. So do you sacrifice a little to gain much? Do we keep on pretending that the issue isn't there and just hold on hoping for the best, or do we take action? No matter what the outcome of such discussion would be, one thing is sure and that's that people will feel let down and disappointed.

* 4. Euro

A monster of complexity:
Can we have states in this union that aren't part of the Euro? Should the Euro be split up into two zones? Should the Euro be put to rest? Or can the Euro survive as it is now?",0,1401057589,null,0,false,0,chr0b7j,t3_26gry3,t1_chr0b7j,t3_26gry3,null,1433952814,16,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,16

* Over 50% of abstention is deplorable. On the good side, there has been a substantial increase in turnout compared to 2009.

* The two big parties have been heavily punished since 2009 (from a combined 80.9% to a combined 49.06%). This confirms a trend of people no longer being afraid of ""wasting"" their vote when voting smaller parties, and could lead to a better and more plural democratic debate. If somehow the defeatist and abstentionist part of Spanish society can be encouraged to vote in support of their beliefs, the political scene in Spain could soon become *very* interesting.

* The pro-independence parties in some regions keep gaining strength, and so do some anti-independence parties in reaction to them.

And I also have to agree with those who say that Merkel is very talented in politcs. 
Being talented in politics does not necessarily mean that what you do is good for the people. It means that in the game of politics you tend to come out on top and that is something Merkel does very well. 

Merkel is strategist who is long term oriented and very patient, she only acts when she is sure all odds are in her favour. She is willing to make short term concessions which sometimes makes her look weak but you can be sure that she has a long term Agenda that will play out quietly in the background and in the end she will come out on top.

... Et la marmotte ?

Avec quoi on aurait fait une nouvelle guerre ? Contre qui ?

L'Allemagne a été coupée en deux et occupée, et son armée n'a jamais été reconstruite. C'est ça qui a évité une nouvelle guerre.

&gt;le rapprochement des populations européennes, notamment à travers les programmes comme Erasmus

Erasmus ??? 

Erasmus ne concerne qu'une infime minorité de la population. Minorité déjà privilégiée qui allait déjà à l'étranger auparavant. Regarde les échanges des pays développés qui n'appartiennent pas à l'UE : ils sont les mêmes.

Erasmus envoie 33000 Français à l'étranger chaque année. Mais chaque année ce sont 150 000 Français qui quittent le système scolaire sans AUCUNE qualification : pas de BEP, pas de CAP, pas de BAC...

Erasmus c'est que dalle. Parmi les 33000 étudiants qui partent à l'étranger un bon nombre serait de toute façon parti sans le programme Erasmus.

&gt;On finance à hauteur de ses richesses, et on reçoit à hauteur de ses besoins.

...

Donc on a trop de déficit et trop de chômage avec pas de croissance, mais on est trop riches...

&gt;Je doute fort que l'agriculture française aient pu résister longtemps face au géant américain (dont les pieds sont d'ailleurs en argile).

Mais comment ça s'est passé entre 1945 et 1962 ?

Regarde les chiffres de la production. Ensuite, regarde combien la France a donné et combien elle a reçu. La conclusion c'est qu'on aurait très bien pu financer la PAC nous même.

&gt;il faut arrêter de grossir volontairement le trait: nos gouvernements respectent globalement les droits de l'homme et l'Etat de droit.

Voui, donc à quoi sert la justice européenne ?

La question est de savoir si l'euro a eu un impact positif ou négatif. Or il a eu un impact négatif. Si on change nos dirigeants, on gardera cette plaie qu'est l'euro. C'est vrai en France, c'est vrai en Espagne, c'est vrai en Italie, c'est vrai en Belgique, et figure toi que c'est aussi vrai en Allemagne et aux Pays-Bas, malgré leur formidables dirigeants !

* Making more expensive to fire employees. Restrict/forbid discretional layoffs in companies with profits.
* the standard retirement age is beign raised from 65 to 67 years. Reduce it to 60.
* Nationalize the assests of the energy cartel(honestly, something needs to be done about the cartel and the two big parties are allied with it).
* 35 hour work week.
* legalization of squatting for poor people(but wasn't everybody going to have enough income to afford a home??).
* Mortgage debt moratorium
* Auditing the public debt. Translation Not paying back the EU bank bailout if the banks can't pay it like the EU-eurozone govenments and the Spanish government agreed. *I seriously think that you deserve this for giving the bailout.*
* And more things, some normal: free university, scolarships, public housing, restoring universal health care, better public transport, anti-nuclear, anti-transgenics...

La vaste majorité des militants ont *dénoncé* la drôle de guerre. La pluaprt des appelés communistes ont combattus.

En toute honnêteté, je considère Ramon Mercader comme un camarade, et non Trotsky.

Un pacifiste qui dit que ""L'Angleterre est vaincue, qu'elle ne peut s'en tirer qu'avec une paix blanche; mais que cette paix blanche devrait se faire sur mon dos de français"", et qui te théorise le front anti-bolchévique.  Charmant. 

J'ajouterais que le PCF, seul en France, a aidé l'Espagne Républicaine. Et que les militants communistes n'ont pas attendu le Front de l'Est pour résister. Maurice Thorez lui-même dénoncait, dès 1934, le danger de la politique ""pacifiste"" d'appaisement, alors même que cette politique ne restait qu'une théorie à cette époque. Le premier Allemand tué à Paris est décédé d'une balle communiste, celle de Pierre George. Idem pour le premier acte de résistance à Toulouse, pour la formation du maquis de Bouconne dans ma région et de tant d'autres... Les grèves de mineurs dans le Nord, organisé par la CGT et le PCF clandestin...

Après la guerre, c'est le PCF qui le premier lanca la bataille de la production, et qui s'efforca d'unir tout les partis français autour de cette perspective. ""Le PCF n'admet aucune exclusive a aucun groupe(...) Le relèvement de la France, ce n'est pas la tâche d'un parti, non plus que de quelques hommes d'états"".

D'ailleurs, les députés communistes avaient été mis au ban et arrêté (voir tué) non pas, comme le mythe le dit, a cause du pacte Molotov-Ribbentrop, mais parce que Laval avait promit à Hitler de ""mettre les communistes à la raison"".

Intervention wouldn't necessarily be necessary, even sending a couple ships to the Black sea would have an effect. Even if we didn't, having ships and willfully not using them would still be preferable over not using them simply because you don't have them.

&gt; There were no enemy ships and Russian ships can always cross our waters. Not escorting the barely serviceable Kuznetzov also sends a message of course.

Russians ships are most definitely enemies. Not a direct 'we-are-at-war' kind of enemy, but they aren't friendly and that ship didn't pass the waters for a neutral mission. The ship was assisting the annexation of territory of a country that we were trying to back. A hostile move. This ship wasn't just passing through for an average patrol. We allowed a warship through our waters, of our biggest rival, on it's way on a hostile mission.

&gt; Not escorting the barely serviceable Kuznetzov also sends a message of course.

Well, there's a big difference between:

* Not sending ships because you don't want to

and

* Not sending ships because you can't

In the first case it would've sent the message: We really don't give a shit. The second case sends the message: We would like to give a shit, but we can't.",0,1401059512,null,0,false,0,chr113f,t3_26gd8v,t1_chr113f,t1_chqzzgz,null,1433953154,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Half of the world population is women, and it's hard (although possible) to change your gender.

&gt;La Phynance, dénoncée par Jarry dans Ubu il y a plus d'un siècle. Un nom pour cette puissance ? J'oserais : la sphère anglo-saxonne. L'Europe de Monnet &amp; Schumann (dont procède directement le viol démocratique, en France, du Traité dit de Lisbonne) n'est qu'un outil au service de cette même ""puissance"" (laquelle, déjà, vacille).

Sur le rôle de Monnet et Schumann, on est d'accord. Sur l'exclusivité du monde anglo-saxon dans l'hégémonie, je nuancerais en ajoutant que toutes les puissances impérialistes sont dans la compétition pour dominer le monde. Pas seulement les puissances anglaises et américaines, même si elles sont hégémoniques.

They look at the problems that our country is experiencing at present, believe (correctly or mistakenly, who knows) that these problems have been caused or exacerbated by large-scale immigration from Europe, as well as the EU taking control away from local governments, and see that the mainstream political parties are not pledging to do anything to change our relationship with the EU.

Putain mais arrêtez avec les USA quoi. C'est justement en partie à cause d'eux si c'est la merde en politique internationale. L'UE est constamment envahie par des lobbys et trop influencée par les USA, idem pour la France. Il ne se passe presque pas un JT sans avoir une nouvelle sur ce qui se passe là-bas. Bon sang quoi, faut arrêter le rêve américains les mecs. Il y a le rêve Européen aussi, il ne faut pas l'oublier.


Et justement, le FN tente de nous faire oublier ça. Il faut regarder qui vote FN et comment ceux-ci arrivent à obtenir des votes: ce sont les gens des campagnes, les moins informés qui se font prendre. ""C'est une preuve du ras-le-bol des Français"". Entre voter pour un mec qui ne tient pas ses promesses mais qui au moins fait tenir le peuple debout et voter pour quelqu'un qui va à coup sûr faire couler le pays, quelle est la meilleure option?

Le FN, ce même parti fondé par un mec raciste qui a eu une dizaine de condamnations pour propos racistes, diffamation, et j'en passe. C'est le parti de l'absurde. Comment peut-on avoir des députés racistes et des immigrants dans le même panier? Comment Le Pen peut-elle dire quelque chose ici et se contredire là-bas?



Non le vrai problème, c'est que les vrais intellectuels de ce pays ne réalisent pas qu'ils ne sont plus majoritaires et qu'ils perdent la main sur le jeu devant les médias. Les médias diabolisent tout. On publie des livres calamiteux (""L'orange mécanique"", quelle blague ce truc et pourtant un outil suffisant pour faire peur aux gens; rien de mieux que des statistiques pour faire peur à quelqu'un qui ne sait pas compter), on n'arrête pas de balancer sur les présidents de la République donc ça ne m'étonne pas qu'un jour où l'autre les humoristes deviennent pris au sérieux. En parlant d'humoristes, ça me rappelle un certain Dieudonné... Si ça c'est pas une belle connerie des médias aussi? Un coup à droite, un coup à gauche, personne de son public ne comprend ce qu'il dit et au final on entendra une bouille d'absurdité sur son sujet, mais suffisamment chaude pour faire gagner quelques votes au FN.


Ce phénomène politique est tout à fait normal. C'est de la manipulation. Il y a une règle en politique internationale: soit les pays s'entendent bien entre eux et c'est la baston à l'intérieur d'eux-mêmes, soit leurs peuples sont contents mais ne se tolèrent pas les uns-des autres. En d'autres mots, pendant que la France a des bonnes relations de lèche-botte avec les USA et le reste du monde, les gens de l'intérieur souffrent d'un manque de rationalité.


Est-ce que nous avons besoin du FN? Chose certaine, c'est que nous avons besoin de nous ressentir Français. Ça nous prend quelqu'un pour donne un coup de pied au cul à ce pays et lui donner de la rationalité. J'habite actuellement au Québec pour mes études et il n'y a pas un seul Français que j'ai connus ici qui ne déblatérait pas notre patrie. Putain les mecs quoi, c'est la France, un pays de vainqueurs, un pays qui en a connu des hauts et des bas mais qui au fils de l'histoire s'est montré puissant et respectable. À entendre tous ceux que je croise et sur Internet, on dirait que c'est un pays du tiers-monde.

Qui vote au FN? Des ignorants, des campagnards, des gens qui n'ont pas appris ou qui ont trop souvent fait l'école buissonnière ( =&gt; qui n'ont rien compris à l'école). On manipule, on montre des images, et on leurs fait croire que c'est la faute à l'Europe s'ils se plaignent de ne pas avoir assez d'argent.



Si on met de côté toutes les diabolisations sur le FN, on trouve en ce parti le sens d'être Français. Je peux parier beaucoup pour penser qu'un jour ils vont vous dire que si vous ne votez pas FN, vous reniez la France et que vous voteriez pour la politique internationale, pour un JT rempli de capsules sur les USA pour promouvoir un rêve Américain de merde.


Pour finir mon commentaire, j'aimerais dire que le vote au centre. Je ne conçois pas le fait qu'un pays puisse se tenir en suivant une seule ligne directrice (qui grosso modo se résume à ""soit on devient individualistes et on se fait les poches, soit on devient philanthropes et on met son argent en commun). On devrait tenir ce pays sur un sens d'adaptation. Après tout, le rôle d'un gouvernement (selon John Locke) c'est de promulguer au peuple la possibilité de vivre, d'être heureux (à chacun sa façon de l'entendre) et d'être libre. Le FN est très loin de prodiguer cette notion, et les autres partis aussi. En revanche au centre on sait qu'il faut s'adapter, qu'une solution est bonne pour un temps mais pas pour l'éternité.",0,1401062472,null,0,false,0,chr23k8,t3_26gldo,t1_chr23k8,t1_chqwiqf,null,1435491752,4,false,france,t5_2qhjz,4

What does that mean? Spending power is the most widely distributed power among any country - the percentage of people that spend some money during a given week is... high... to put it mildly. So it's democratic in that sense.

Presumably you mean you'd like the money to be more evenly spread, as a command economy is really anything but democratic.

&gt; If the workers collectively ran and managed these companies they never would have left. 

That's not democratizing anything, because to allow for this, you'd have to force everyone to buy potentially more expensive products. So you're  letting, say, 50,000 workers influence the decisions of 50,000,000 buyers. Democracy? Far from it.

&gt; When you hear politicians talking about ""making our country competitive"" all they mean is lowering wages of workers

Sometimes they do that. What they also mean is creating a good environment for both new ""layman"" companies (IE hot dog stands etc) and super high potential companies (largely dominated by the US, particularly Silicon Valley).

For this you need things like education, but also available funding for founders. Yes, not the workers, but the founders  (who are the original workers). Making it as easy as possible for people to come up with a great idea that will end up employing tens of thousands and run with it is a big part of  what this discussion is about.

As a practical example I'm a Finnish entrepreneur that lives in Boston now. Why Boston? Because everything is cheap? Fuck no, this place is crazy expensive - a coder goes for like $100-150k if they're any good, and Silicon Valley is even more expensive.

Reasons:      
a) Great access to well educated population that has practical experience. There's tons of great universities here (Harvard &amp; MIT are particularly good recruiting grounds) **and** there's a lot of experience in the workforce of really varied work.      
b) Funding is much more easily available. Oh, they're more demanding than Europe for what we have to do, but if you can manage, there's tons of money to be had.     
c) Customers that are more open to start-ups  and new companies in general, and certainly none gives a fuck that the company isn't originally American.       
etc

The state  of Massachusetts  has some big projects to stay competitive with $1bn being pumped in to particularly life sciences ecosystem. Improving all high schools chemistry/biology classes even further (MA has some of the best education in the US already, perfectly comparable to the likes of Finland) etc. That's an example of how to ""increase competitiveness"". 

&gt; lowering corporate tax rates to entice capitalists to invest there

The corporate taxes shouldn't be all that high ultimately, but it's crazy that it's a zero sum game in Europe. If there's a tax that should be Europe wide, it should be corporate tax, which then in turn could fund all of EU. This would stop the silly jumping around of companies.

Still, it really should be in the 20-30% range and no higher.

&gt; The profit motive which is the central drive in capitalism will lead to the third worldization of western countries

It led to any country becoming first world, so I wouldn't go there. The profit motive is the biggest driver for progress in human history.

Market capitalism is like fire. I agree with you that if left unguarded it's a bad thing. Your declaration that humanity should give up fire and just go without strikes me as utter lunacy though.

&gt; we have to start discussing post capitalist economic systems.

We aren't leaving capitalism behind for a long time, possibly never. However, it will get layered with more things. Possible a capitalism resting on top of a baseline communist society.

Green EU PM's have said that N-VA will most likely have to look for a new fraction in the EU parliament because their views are too different. So we're looking more at 2 green seats. Another important detail: OP's picture was before all results were counted, in reality the liberals got 6 seats instead of 5 which puts them on par with the greens+regionalists.

* The Strasbourg shuffle is encoded into the Treaties, meaning the EU can't do anything about that even if it wanted to (and the MEP leading the charge against it lost his seat tonight, while MEPs happy to complain about it while doing nothing - UKIP ones - were re-elected) - the Strasbourg shuffle is a symptom of national governments trying to be protectionist. Because of those sorts of attitudes it would arguably take a national referendum in the UK to approve a treaty change fixing this problem.

The EU's problem in the UK is mostly that no one takes it seriously; in the media and in politics it is treated as a joke, routinely lied about, commonly misunderstood (particularly among those who grew up with earlier iterations), and a by-word for anything foreign and problematic. The Government uses it as a place to sneak through legislation they might have trouble getting through the national Parliament (but which they can later blame the EU on), political parties use it as a training ground for the real job of being an MP, and the media will happily eat up any story criticising it.

I would guess that part of the UK public's (at least, the 16% who voted against it last week) problem relates immigration fears, rather than the EU itself; UKIP have replaced the BNP as the party to protect the UK from evil foreigners, coming here, stealing jobs, committing crime and changing our way of life with their foreign cultural values.",0,1401069480,null,0,false,0,chr4rid,t3_26gry3,t1_chr4rid,t1_chr44gv,null,1433954971,57,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,57

I do not have any experience with your field, but I can give you the same advice I would give to any bachelor student in this position:

1. Ask professors you know about it. Of course it helps if they are on that specific topic (did you take a course that sparked that interest? who taught it? ). Also, it doesn't have to be professors from your department. Since you already know two examples, you can simply drop professors from those departments an e-mail and tell them what is your interest and if they know departments that will suit you in Germany.

2. I am sure there are conferences or journals on the topic (again, the more specialized you can get the better). Scan through the speaker or the author lists, they always have the university and department next to them. This can get you a list of departments.

Hopefully having collected some departments from the above processes, you can now start looking at departments and even potential advisors if you are considering a PhD. ",0,1401069560,null,0,false,0,chr4snl,t3_26hibo,t1_chr4snl,t3_26hibo,null,1433954986,4,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,4

1. UKIP, FN are not neo-nazi. I cant speak of the other ones as Im less informed. The only big neo-nazis parties in Europe are in Eastern Europe as /u/MartelFirst said

2. You can be far right in different ways. The term far right doesnt explain the complexitiy well. In general far right means very conservative or reactionary. Basically you want to preserve tradition, support the elites in power, support historic institutions, have more authority. But there are alot of differences amongst far right parties. For example the UKIP's policy on the economy (free trade) is very very different from the FN's (statist)

3. National Socialism does not equal Socialism. The Nazi and Fascist movement was influenced by Socialism, Musolinni for example used to be in the Italian Socialist party until he was kicked out for advocating Italy to fight in WW1 while the official party line was for no fighting. They are the movements in Europe which really started using the masses to participate. They are movements which really call for a revolution of the normal society. They are against financial capitalism, but ultimately they have opposing goals. As I said far right is generally thought to be supporting the elites, preserve tradidition, and be authoritarian. Well the far left was authoritarian in practice aswell, but in the other secctors they were the opposite of the far right. For example Nazis tried to promote a new German pagan religion, Socialists ban the church. Nazis promote aristocrats and big business, Socialists kill or take away what they own, Nazis try to bring back old German culture, Socialists in USSR try to take it away and build a new modern Russia. So as you can see they have very different goals. Just because Socialist is in the name of Nazis does not make them Socialists. The Nazis infact hated Socialists and persecuted and killed thousands of German Socialists.

Tatsache ist, die AfD wird von vielen, d.h. so weit ich weiß allen, seriösen Medien nicht als rechtsextrem eingestuft. Vielleicht erklärt das zum Teil die Verwirrung, denn rechts wird oft mit rechtsextrem gleichgesetzt.

Just no. Might as well take up numerology or something.

&gt; The nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by his own side, but he has a remarkable capacity for not even hearing about them. For quite six years the English admirers of Hitler contrived not to learn of the existence of Dachau and Buchenwald. And those who are loudest in denouncing the German concentration camps are often quite unaware, or only very dimly aware, that there are also concentration camps in Russia. Huge events like the Ukraine famine of 1933, involving the deaths of millions of people, have actually escaped the attention of the majority of English Russophiles. Many English people have heard almost nothing about the extermination of German and Polish Jews during the present war. Their own antisemitism has caused this vast crime to bounce off their consciousness. In nationalist thought there are facts which are both true and untrue, known and unknown. A known fact may be so unbearable that it is habitually pushed aside and not allowed to enter into logical processes, or on the other hand it may enter into every calculation and yet never be admitted as a fact, even in one's own mind.

-- George Orwell, [""Notes on Nationalism""](http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/essays/notes-on-nationalism.htm)

""Fun"" fact, that famine is part of the reason why there are so many Russian-speaking people in the east of the Ukraine.

&gt;* The open borders is really a Schengen Area thing, which the UK isn't signed up to,



No, it refers to the right of 485 million people to live in the UK, which we are unfortunately signed up to without our consultation, indeed in direct opposition to public opinion.

&gt;* The EU is now arguably more democratic (on paper) than the UK Government, the President of the Commission now being elected by the Parliament (although gods know how that's going to work with the new one),



How can you possibly say this when MEPs do not have the right to initiate or repeal legislation? It can only vote on proposals from the commission, an unelected body. Quite shocking that you would say this, the democratic deficit is acknowledged even by pro-EU politicians as an area for reform.

&gt;* The Strasbourg shuffle is encoded into the Treaties, meaning the EU can't do anything about that even if it wanted to (and the MEP leading the charge against it lost his seat tonight, while MEPs happy to complain about it while doing nothing - UKIP ones - were re-elected) - the Strasbourg shuffle is a symptom of national governments trying to be protectionist. 



This is the point, national governments will *always* have this tendency if they are worth their salt. The Strasbourg shuffle highlights the inefficacy of the EU institutions to handle and resolve such national interests for the common European interest, which is what the EU is for!

&gt;I would guess that part of the UK public's (at least, the 16% who voted against it last week) problem relates immigration fears, rather than the EU itself; UKIP have replaced the BNP as the party to protect the UK from evil foreigners, coming here, stealing jobs, committing crime and changing our way of life with their foreign cultural values.

For example, the Council of the European Union has a rotating presidency, and the votes are weighted in favour of smaller states. The same with the European Parliament, where most smaller states get a disproportionately higher number of seats.

Smaller countries can influence events to far stronger degree within the EU than they can from without. That is simply undeniable. The extent of that influence within the EU depends on how much political willpower they are willing to exert and how much of a fuck the population actually gives. 

Ireland, before our big mess, was quite an influential member state within the Union. Luxembourg's former PM is looking like he'll be the next Commission President(Assuming EPP dominated coalition).

This means the competition for jobs will go up, especially easy jobs where you'll usually get work experience.

At the same time they make tax reductions for employers like mcdonald's in hope of making new jobs, which did not happend (surprise surprise). Mcdonald's have tons of people lining up to get a job. The Swedish public employment service tries to hide statistics by sending people out on unpaid interships, giving people a short education or going to ""job coaches"".

Another problem is that the government decides to take in tons more people when we have a housing shortage.

&gt;**Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski has died. He was 90.**  
After a long and difficult struggle with cancer, Wojciech Jaruzelski has died, confirmed former President of the Polish Press Agency, Aleksander Kwaśniewski. Not long ago, Jaruzelski experienced a stroke. He was a First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Prime Minister of the Polish People's Republic, chairman of the Polish Council of State, and President of Poland. He was 90 years of age.  
Gen. Jaruzelski died on Sunday at 15:24 in the military hospital by Szaserów street in Warsaw, where he stayed for a few months with breaks.  
The chief of the Presidential press office Joanna Trzaska-Wieczorek stated: ""before committing to any action regarding the funeral of general Wojciech Jaruzelski, it is important to recognize the will of the family.""  
**The general was very ill. He practically did not leave his home for 2 years.**  
For two years, the life of Jaruzelski alternated between home and hospital. ""I feel very ill, so I almost never leave home. I am too weak to go somewhere or actively spend my time,"" reported a magazine in mid-May. In the discussion, he admitted that he was not counting on a recovery any longer.  
In 2009, Jaruzelski underwent an operation to remove a tumor from his face. Afterwards, he went to the hospital several times due to lung inflammation and heart weakness. Doctors stated that these were associated with the tumor.  
Last year, doctors from the Military Medical Institute in Warsaw diagnosed a growing cancer. It turned out that it was lymphoma; chemotherapy was begun, which Jaruzelski struggled to undergo.  
During a longer stay in the hospital, Jaruzelski was visited by former President Lech Wałęsa. [On the internet, he posted an image with the label, ""Mr. General, \[I wish you\] health.""](http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114873,10349572,Walesa_odwiedzil_Jaruzelskiego_w_szpitalu___Panie.html)  

&gt;**Siberia and the general's dark glasses**  
Wojciech Jaruzelski was born in 1923 in Kurów. Before the war, he was a student of a high school run by the Marian Order in the Bielany district of Warsaw. From 10 years of age, Jaruzelski lived in boarding school. ""Every morning, a priest strides into the 20-person hall, clapping; 'get up, get up.' Everyone kneels by their beds and say a prayer,"" [cited the Gazeta Wyborcza.](http://wyborcza.pl/1,96399,6057110,Jaruzelski__Od_zakonnej_szkoly_po_komunistyczna_legitymacje.html)  
In 1939, Jaruzelski and his family escaped to Lithuania. In 1940, when the country was annexed by the Soviet Union, he was sent to Siberia, where he worked in the taiga by a clearing. Difficult conditions caused snow blindness, which affected his vision in the long-term. During his deportation in Siberia, he lost his father.  

&gt;**Military career**  
Jaruzelski wanted to join gen. Anders' army. Eventually, he was drafted to the 2nd Infantry Division of Henryk Dąbrowski. He took part in battles by the Vistula, on magnuszewski's beachhead, for Warsaw, for the Pomeranian embankment, and also by the Baltic, Oder, and Elbe.  
According to the Institute of National Remembrance, from the end of the war until 1954, he cooperated with the Military Information under the pseudonym ""Wolski."" Jaruzelski denies this.  
In 1962, he was appointed as vice-minister of national defense. From 1965, he fulfilled the function of chief of the Polish General Staff. In 1968, he was appointed as Lt. General and Minster of National Defense, which he headed until 1983. His subordinate units took part in the suppression of the Prague Spring by Warsaw Pact forces in Operation Danube.  
Wojciech Jaruzelski also oversaw the suppression of workers during the events of December 1970 by the coast. He was accused of co-responsibility for these bloody events. Jaruzelski claimed that the order of shooting at the workers fell upon the highest administration of the Polish United Workers' Party, to which he then did not belong to as a substitute member of the Politburo, and that he does not carry responsibility for what occurred.  
As the commander of the armed forces of the Polish People's Republic, on 16 July 1975, he expressed agreement to shooting down a Polish civil An-2 aircraft, whose pilot, Dionizy Bielański, wanted to escape to Austria.  

&gt;**Martial law**  
From August 1980, with the National Defense Committee and the General Staff of the Polish Army, he began work upon instituting martial law in Poland. On 12 November 1980, two days after the official registration of the trade union ""Solidarność,"" he revealed at a meeting of KOK that he had prepared a set of necessary legislation regarding martial law. On 5 December, at the summit of Warsaw Pact countries in Moscow, gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski introduced the idea to independently liquidate Solidarność and opposition whenever they show initial signs of exhausting society.  
On 13 December 1981, he declared martial law in Poland and headed the Military Council of National Salvation.  
According to estimated by the Institute of National Remembrance, from December 1981 to July 1983, during the communist-imposed martial law, as a result of shootings and beatings during strikes and demonstrations, at least 56 persons died.  
In February 1992, the Sejm voted with a large majority to adopt a resolution that recognized the decision to implement martial law as contrary to the constitution of the Polish People's Republic. A special commission was appointed to hear the then-members of the Council of State, but the parliament was concluded after a year, and the power of the Democratic Left Alliance and Polish People's Party resigned from the investigation.  

&gt;**After the Round Table**  
In the mid-80s, Jaruzelski resigned from the office of Prime Minister and became the head of the Council of State. In 1989, he agreed to the proceedings of the Round Table, which resulted in the political transformation of the People's Republic of Poland. In 1989, he was chosen as President, which he remained until 1990, when Lech Wałęsa won.  
In January 1991, the general finished his career of military service.  
From 1993, in the anniversary of the announcement of martial law, demonstrations of opponents and supporters of the institution of martial law occurred before Wojciech Jaruzelski's house in the Mokotów district of Warsaw.  
Wojciech Jaruzelski received many awards—among others, the Silver Cross of the Virtuti Militari, Order of the Builders of People's Poland, Knight's Cross and Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta, as well as twice Cross of Valor. In March 2006, Jaruzelski was awarded a Siberian Exiles Cross by President Lech Kaczyński. Commenting on this, he stated that he is joyous that President Kaczyński has risen above and beyond historical divisions. The Office of the President immediately stated that Jaruzelski was awarded due to a mistake, because ""the President only accepted provisions, but not lists of people"" and did not recognize that Wojciech Jaruzelski was present on the list. After this statement, Jaruzelski returned his award to the Presidential Palace.",0,1401078320,null,0,false,0,chr7zt5,t3_26g5yp,t1_chr7zt5,t3_26g5yp,null,1433956492,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

Deny it all you want. Treating women and children like cattle and enforcing abhorrent medieval practices isn't compatible with modern civilization. What does it take for you to notice this? Does it take someone getting beheaded on the street in the name of Islam? Does it take scores of young women being genitally mutilated and branded like cattle? Does it take clerics and imans preaching death to west and ""how to"" terrorist manuals? Does it take a few Mosques being a breeding ground for radicalization? Does it take groups of religious patrols enforcing segregation and sexism in universities? And what about those patrolling the streets threatening those non Muslim? 

I do admit some of these cases are highly magnified by the media, but still, there's a growing issue here. These should be totally unacceptable  behaviors anywhere!

But honestly, I've been trying to think about what connects France and England. I mean there is a long history, but the culture and politics are still quite different.

I really suspect it might be some sort of subconscious imperial pride left over from when we ruled the planet... Maybe subconsciously the English and the French believe they can regain their former glory, but it's the EU that's holding us back...

Something like ""We ruled the fucking world, and then those bloody Europeans (!) came in and fucked everything up, they are so incompetent! Most of them never even had a single colony!""

And it's an overblown issue imo mostly put into focus due to the crisis. Regardless I've found European immigrants to be among the more easy to integrate. They don't (have to) pull the refugee card and mostly come for either a specific job or education and if they come for neither they can be kicked out by the country they're in if they don't find work in time.

If you mean other immigration then you should consider that whilst the EU has provided funds for that (Some helicopters for the southern nations and such I believe) It's mostly still a national competency and has little to do with the EU on many fronts. You can argue they should provide more there and provide more front for cooperation between and funds border-countries but then you'd arguing for more competencies for the EU wouldn't you.

&gt;Problem member states

I'd much rather push to reform them then kick them out. They won't leave on their own and kicking one out does have consequences. It chips at the credibility of the Euro and won't be taken mildly by the markets who will likely flip their shit at the next sick man because he might be dropped. In the end I'm more for something close to federalisation and stopping us from getting such a sick man. Taking the hit as a whole limiting long term consequences and moving on a la USA but that's just me. If you want a much much slimmer union without the euro and whatnot though you're removing reasons to remove them though and you better keep them whether you want it or not.


&gt;Hence there needs to be a decision made on what the people actually want the EU to be.

And there very recently was one. People could vote for the reformists but rarely they did. More vote anti EU then for a smaller EU or whatever they want.

No, that is not true.  The French government wanted to intervene in Syria more than the US and UK did.

Quote from 2012, regarding intervention in Syria:

The urge to do something is particularly strong in France, which has historical ties to Syria and whose then-President Nicolas Sarkozy rallied the United States and other allies around his proposal to bomb government forces in Libya. Moreover, France is the country where the idea of a “right to intervene” to save lives abroad was born, and where it has since expanded in the eyes of many into a “duty to intervene.”

Frustrated by Russian and Chinese vetoes in the U.N. Security Council and President Obama’s reluctance to commit U.S. forces, some French opinion leaders have criticized President Francois Hollande for failing to organize an international intervention even without a Security Council mandate. The implication of their challenge is that a resolute France could persuade Obama to change his mind or that a French-led European coalition could act with neighboring Turkey.

Even though the workers do everything, produce products, in effect creating everything we have. And still, the workers are at the bottom of the food chain. It's no better than feudalism. What's the point of democracy in politics, if we have to unconditionally adhere to a regime of CEOs for the best part of the day?

Also, you appear to defend trickle down economics. Trickle down economics is bullshit. Recently, Boeiing received a huge tax break. Right after, they announced lay-offs. If companies receive extra money, it goes straight into the CEO's and share holders' pockets, as they will be running at minimal expenses in the first place. In fact, the only way trickle down economics can work is by increasing consumption, as that will increase production, so companies will *have* to hire more people. And the best way to increase consumption is (shocker) to give more money to the consumer.",0,1401090410,null,0,1401090675,0,chrb421,t3_26gry3,t1_chrb421,t1_chr44xu,null,1433957970,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

I see a vote against the EU as a very positive thing. I am not remotely nationalist or uneducated or irrational. I am an internationalist.

The only reason the EU has a hard time doing anything is because of national interests that has a say because of nationalism. Without that sentimental nonsense we could have had a much better functioning and democratic union. With that, however, we have an EU that cannot act as it should against unemployment and lack of growth. It simply does not have the power.

The great problem with not uniting is how it affects our future. Alone no European country can stand against the giants we have to compete with. Alone we become prey and are beholden to others who do not share our values or interests. If we do not unite and become a power of our own then every single nation in the EU will be dominated by one foreign power or other.

Likewise, do you really think we can do anything about corporations without uniting properly? We cannot. Without integration then corporations will play individual nations against each other. However with further integration we can leverage our huge markets against them and impose good regulation.

Penser que le stéréotypage est une forme de violence est certes vrai dans un débat de nuance et de finesse, mais ""antisémitisme"" est tellement connoté que je trouve un peu risqué de faire un rapprochement gras entre toutes les formes d'ignorance et toutes les formes de haine.

Être ignorant et/ou indifférent est différent d'être en opposition. À une époque où il faut tout accepter, ne pas accepter (sans pour autant refuser) est pratiquement une déclaration de guerre. C'est moche.

Ma copine était chez ses parents ce week-end. Je sais, une histoire qui commence par ces mots ne peut pas se finir bien, mais écoutez-moi. J'ai commencé avec deux potes vendredi soir par un petit after-work à boire des gin-martinis dans un bar, à me demander dans quel resto j'allais manger. C'était sans compter sans une ""ex"" polonaise (je mets le mot entre guillemets car ma relation avec cette femme n'était que charnelle, et jamais émotionnelle). Elle m'a envoyé un whatsapp au milieu de la soirée pour reprendre contact, et a terminé par ""Ah, et j'étais en train de repenser aux moments où tu passais chez moi. Putain qu'est-ce que c'était bon!""

Cette phrase a fait ressurgir un énorme complexe que je me traîne depuis les six dernières années. Voyez-vous, avant d'entrer dans mon actuelle relation durable, j'étais... ben, j'étais un loser (l'utilisation du passé est douteuse, mais bon) et je n'ai jamais eu le succès auprès des femmes que j'aurais voulu avoir. A l'inverse, ma copine elle a eu le temps de s'amuser. Maintenant que je suis entré dans une relation durable, que j'ai fermement l'intention de faire durer jusqu'à ce que la mort nous sépare, je regrette de n'avoir pas eu le temps de batifoler un peu avant de m'attacher. La Polonaise que je mentionne ci-dessus est une exception à la règle, et ne change pas le fond de ma pensée.

J'ai complètement pété un plomb. Je me suis retrouvé avec mes potes dans un bar de bastille, à enquiller des vodkas comme si les chars russes descendaient les Champs-Elysées. Minable ne décrit même pas ma condition. Malheureusement, une fois l'alcool cuvé, la tension n'est pas redescendue. 

J'ai passé la journée de samedi au fond du trou, une sensatio nque je n'avais pas ressenti depuis très, trèèèèès longtemps. J'ai hésité très sérieusement à appeler une escort-girl pour la soirée. J'ai pris mon téléphone et je l'ai posé, je l'ai repris et je l'ai reposé. La seule chose qui m'a arrêté c'est que je suis fidèle, putain. 

Bon, ça et le fait qu'un des potes de la soirée précédente m'a proposé un truc pour me changer les idées. Je me suis retrouvé dans un bar dansant du 5e arrondissement qui organisait une soirée ""douche de champagne"". Une ambiance unique, les mecs ont fini torse nu et les femmes dansaient en soutien-gorge, mais sans saleté aucune (Le bar à pour première règle ""les dalleux dehors!"" et la clientèle se tient très bien). J'ai dansé sur le bar, chemise ouverte, j'ai pris des paillettes dans la figure et du champagne partout, j'ai absolument pas dragué tellement j'avais mieux à faire, 2-3 gars m'ont approché assez directement (et je suis, pour une fois, entré dans leur jeu), et tout ça en buvant 3 bières entre 21h et 2h du matin, donc rien de faramineux.

J'me suis retrouvé à 2h du matin à sortir de là avec mon pote accompagné de 2 gars et une nana qu'on avait rencontré sur place, à finir la soirée chez mon pote à écouter de la musique et boire du jus d'orange. Le temps de rentrer chez moi, j'ai dormi de 4h30 à 11h et je suis allé voter.

Ce matin, je crache encore des paillettes (j'en avais jusque dans les poils de la poitrine), j'ai la voix cassée, j'ai dormi un total de 10h ce week-end, mais je me suis vidé la tête comme jamais et j'avais rien à me reprocher quand ma copine est rentrée.

Riflessioni random:

- Non ho ancora chiarissimo il breakdown dei non iscritti, credo che siano perlopiù euroscettici, ma in ogni caso la grande vittoria è loro. A mio avviso risultatico sintomatico della scia di malcontento verso l'euro e le politiche economiche europee. Un po' ce lo si aspettava.

- L'EPP è lo schieramento che ha ceduto più seggi, 55. 

- La sinistra e i verdi tengono botta.

- Male l'ALDE, mi rassegno al fatto che i liberali in Europa valgono come il 2 di spade quando la briscola è coppe. In Italia hanno preso lo 0,7%. Devo cominciare a farmi delle domande.

- Pochi cambiamenti di rilievo negli altri schieramenti. 

Non ho idea di come i singoli partiti intendano votare per la presidenza quindi non mi esprimo su chi sarà ragionevolmente eletto.

m5s caduta repentina, anche la base convinta si sta cominciando a stancare seriamente dei diktat dall'alto (ad esempio parlare ad insaputa dei milioni di elettori di scioglimento del m5s nell'immediato futuro et simili), inoltre non si è ancora creata una base decisionale che non consista in grillo e casaleggio quando hanno voglia di sentirsi, e nonostante i tanti sforzi dei parlamentari di buona volontà ne rimangono altrettanti impreparati e incapaci di esprimere un indirizzo e un opinione autonoma (vedi l'imbarazzante conferenza stampa della lombardi ieri sera)

FI in caduta ma sinceramente uno deve avere davvero dei buoni motivi per votare un partito che preclude qualsiasi proprio sviluppo e futuro oltre una persona condannata che non può essere candidata, mi dispiace quasi per il centrodestra ( ma anche no :) ) ;

That can easily last a year and there's no real entrance requirement.  That being said, there are other immigration problems with this route (you may need to have a sponsor, you will have to check). 

I worked when I was here on a language visa, and with the blessing of the immigration office. No limitation on the number of hours either. She said, since you are American, then you can work.  My immigration officer brought up the US/Germany friendship treaty before I did as well.  She knew a lot about the US.  She said I could work unrestrictedly in Germany and my ID card said as much (as does my new residency permit, but I have since entered into a doctoral program and married a German so things are different now).  She also joked that if she tried to go to the US she doubted that they would be as friendly to her as she was to me, to which I heartily agreed. 

My best advice is to find your German friend who is the most persuasive and drag them to the immigration office to have a chat.  My experience is that the German immigration officers are really helpful if you bring in a fluent German speaker (this is experience in both Hamburg and Lower Saxony).

Soit 4 600 000 de personnes pour le FN.

En 2012, celui ci obtenait 6 421 000 de voix. 

Ce qui confirme totalement notre analyse du 20 mai que je vous rappelle ici:
""Dimanche soir.
Nous aurons probablement le fn comme deuxième voire même premier en score aux élections européennes.
Mais en nombre d'électeurs , quel chiffre? L'abstention promet d'être faramineuse. 60 voire 70%.

Acte 1: Nous allons assister au ballet des faux culs des deux formations principales qui vont nous expliquer combien ils sont tristes que l'abstention soit aussi importante, sans dire bien sur que en ce qui concerne leurs programmes, c'est bonnet blanc et blanc bonnet à part sur des questions sociétales.
Qu'ils vont tout faire pour enrayer cette montée de l'abstention et que dès lundi ils ne feront rien. Comme d'habitude.

Acte deux: ""ah là là le FN est trop haut c'est un désastre pour la démocratie"". bien sûr aucun ne mettra cela en relation avec l'abstention massive. Aucun ne dira qu'au fond le fn stagne et en nombre d'électeur ne progresse pas. Le feraient ils qu'ils se verraient reprendre de volée sur le nombre pitoyable de LEURS électeurs.

Acte 3: le fn va crier au triomphe sans dire que finalement en voix c'est une raclée et que si ce parti fasciste reste un bon attrape gogo pour les électeurs protestataires, il ne progresse pas réellement.

Alors nous aurons droits aux mines réjouies des fafs (et peut être à une tentative d'incursion de leur part sur cette page), mais vous qui aurez lu ce petit post vous sourirez en leur balançant dans la tronche! ^^

Mais ca ne suffira pas. Et dès lundi nous serons là pour VOUS être utiles dans VOS combats politiques, quels qu'ils soient du moment que vous soyez antifascistes.""

* I didn't expect those 5 seats for Podemos. I know for certain they didn't. It's an unprecedent victory and one they rightly should feel proud of. They did everything right (not only the open primaries, but also things like refusing to stop their campaign) and it paid off wonderfully. I hear some people on the left complaining about how all those votes for Podemos should've gone to IU or even that IU and Podemos should've joined forces... but I don't think both forces would've had such a great results together. Plenty of people voting for Podemos won't even touch IU with a ten feet pole. And I mention this because IU is now making offers to Podemos to run next elections together... and I think it'd be a huge political mistake now for Iglesias and his group to accept them.

* Bipartidism is not dead and the system is still intact, sorry. Some people pointed out how PP and PSOE together don't even reach a 50% of the votes, but they are completely ignoring their traditional allies: CiU, PNV and CC. The terrible PPSOE results, if anything, point out how big of a role these parties could play in electing the next government. Which brings me to the next point!

* You can't ignore the results in Catalonia. You just can't (but something tells me they will). Congratulations to ERC and their voters, I've always been more of a fan of Rovira but screw it, awesome (and check those Balears results!). That said, the true winners of yesterday's elections are CiU. Why, you may ask? They lost the first place! Well, if you talked with ERC high-ups in the last weeks they would tell you that winning the elections was a given, but they didn't want to surpass CiU for that much. And the reason is because these results put CiU in the perfect position to negotiate with Madrid: ""look, ERC is coming, you better give me something or else risk losing political control of Catalonia"". A desperate gambit, but one that may work right now.

* The PSOE campaign was well done, Valenciano was a great candidate and things were looking ""good"" for them. They did their best and it wasn't enough, which leads to the obvious: either the PSOE reinvents itself or it dies. As simple as that. Anything is possible but I don't think Rubalcaba is going to resign today, he'll probably announce he won't run as a candidate for the party primaries, but that's about it. A grand coalition (no matter how accurately it would reflect the EU situation) is tantamount to political suicide for the Spanish socialist party and everybody is aware of that. IU is no longer an ally, especially after those 5 seats going to Podemos, and CiU, PNV and CC would rather deal with a PP in government since it would provide feedback for their nationalist diatribes. Andalusia and Asturias saved the day, but the PSOE is now lost in the desert and I don't expect them to come back anytime soon.

* Ciudadanos ended up taking a lot of votes from UPyD. They are aware of that but everybody is still kind of happy (Ciudadanos expected a lot more votes, that I can tell), so no real harm done. UPyD is reaching a point where they could very well become a decisive party for electing the next Spanish president. What will this mean in a future legislature with an empowered nationalist bloc? I don't know, but it'll be fun to see.

Das Ergebnis war bei jeder Person nahezu deckungsgleich: Es fehlt uns an Profil. Man steht für nichts mehr und verkauft seiner Selbst, nur um einen jämmerlichen Ministerposten zu bekommen. Westerwelle, Rösler und Brüderle haben dieses Denken verkörpert. Diese Auffassung teile ich und nahezu alle Personen, welche ich in der FDP kenne teilen diese Auffassung ebenfalls.

Fakt ist: Wir werden für niedrigere Steuern, weniger Regulierungen, mehr Freihandel und weniger Interventionismus gewählt. Wenn wir allerdings nichts am Einkommenssteuersystem ändern, aber Hotelsteuern senken, uns an diversen Regulierungsbestrebungen in der EU beteiligen und Banken retten, dann kann man so viele gesellschaftsliberale Themen umsetzen wie man möchte (Was auch getan wurde), letztlich geht dann das große bürgerlich-wirtschaftsliberale Lager wieder zurück zur CDU und genau das ist passiert.",0,1401096308,null,0,false,0,chrc4n7,t3_26gpsx,t1_chrc4n7,t3_26gpsx,null,1433958507,5,false,de,t5_22i0,5

Eastern Europe was going to be carved up by the Molotov-Ribbentrop pacts anyway, so let's not pretend that incorporation into the USSR/Warsaw Pact was a consequence of the fight against Nazi Germany.

WW2 could have had a very different outcome if Nazi Germany wasn't also fighting the Soviets.

Really the only option to avoid Eastern Europe being swallowed by Soviets would have been to fight them after the defeat of Nazi Germany. I don't know what that could have achieved other than more bloodshed and a protracted war.

and yes I will agree trickle down economy is bullshit but he also suggested that the state provided at least a baseline living. Like in the Nordic countries where Delhuru is from. If a system for providing a baseline of living that is acceptable (as in not just providing food and education but also making sure that you have money for other activities) was adopted worldwide then the playing field would be levelled and alow for a much more equal economy.

But still comparing the corporate model to that of a feudal system is a bit to much I would say. In a feudal system the peasants have no rights and are bound to their lord. In our world today you are free to quit your job if you don't like it there may not be many other jobs you can take but that would be because the economy is bad in comparison if the economy was bad in a feudal system people would likely die of starvation. So I think that we can atleast agree that it's better to live in our system even though it's not perfect than in a feudal system.

true,canteloupy,ZBSuisse,Suisse,"En ce qui concerne les médicaments, c'est bénéfique d'avoir une procédure qui couvre un grand marché pour plusieurs raisons, et d'avoir un organisme avec plus de pouvoir, notamment de regard sur les essais cliniques.

Premièrement, ça coûte moins cher pour les entreprises. Indirectement ça bénéficie aux patients puisque le coût de développement et d'autorisation est moins grand, et ça va plus vite.

Deuxièmement, ça permet aux entreprises de commercialiser aussi dans des petits marchés. Parce que si t'as un marché de 300 millions comme aux USA ça vaut le coup de passer par les obstacles administratifs. Par contre, un marché de 8 millions comme la Suisse, c'est petit, des fois ça vaut pas le coup. Alors faire partie d'un gros marché ça peut permettre d'avoir accès à certains trucs directement. Bon, la plupart des gros blockbusters passe aussi dans les petits pays mais il y a des fois des cas bizarres qui peuvent être évités par ce genre de mesure.

En ce qui concerne les essais cliniques, il y a une tendance pour les pharmas d'aller tester dans des pays plus pauvres les médocs destinés aux marchés riches. C'est pas terrible. On peut imaginer qu'une EMA plus puissante qui englobe aussi des pays de l'Est aurait du poids pour faire des demandes de ce côté. En plus il y a des campagnes actuellement concernant la transparence des essais cliniques où l'EMA apparaît comme un acteur important pour faire pression sur les entreprises pour qu'elles divulguent ces infos et de réglementer les essais dans ce sens. Lien : http://www.alltrials.net/2014/europe-votes-for-clinical-trial-transparency/

Il y a encore du boulot. Par contre, faire ça avec 25 agences différentes c'est pas efficace et c'est pas gagné. Centraliser ces questions c'est beaucoup mieux. Et on ne parle même pas de la pharmacovigilance : si on arrive à centraliser des infos sur 500 millions de gens c'est beaucoup plus d'infos que sur 60 millions de gens.

En fait, c'est forcément compliqué de coordonner autant de pays et de gens. Mais il y a des domaines où clairement il n'y a pas de frontières. La santé en fait partie.

Credo che il fattore che maggiormente ha inciso in questa tornata elettorale sia dato dalla costante campagna denigratoria che i mass media effettuano verso il MoVimento. Abbiamo avuto la conferma che il popolo italiano non capisce dove è il buono. Finchè non si comprenderà che ognuno deve essere il giornalista di se stesso, questo Paese andrà sempre più giù.
In ogni caso NON MOLLIAMO.

Io proprio non capisco.
Se un partito di governo prende il 40% vuol dire che va tutto bene. Giusto?
Va tutto bene?
Io non credo, però magari sono io che non vedo la reale situazione, non lo so.

Due rapidi pensieri:
- Il governo, come è composto, non ha più senso di esistere. Che scelta civica abbia un ministro è inaccettabile. Stessa cosa per NCD. (4%).
- All'italiano che da 0 a 10 vive da 7/8, non frega nulla di quelli che stanno dallo 0 al 6.
- Beppe ci ha aiutato tantissimo ma forse è il momento di cambiare strategia e quindi anche ""megafono"".

forza e coraggio

#vinciamopoi bellissimo. spero serva di lezione, la democrazia è dialogo non lupare bianche. per ottenere dei risultati su battaglie più che giuste che il m5s porta avanti serve dialogo, se lo si capisce si possono ottenere risultati, l'alternativa è fare la fine della lega o dell'UDC, puntare ad una misera sopravvivenza fine a se stessa.

sporcarsi di più le mani anche con decisioni scomode, non mediatiche, ma necessarie, questo devono fare i politici. la campagna elettorale eterna con toni da insulto stanca, stanca anche chi crede che alcune delle battaglie del m5s siano sacrosante.

buona giornata a tutti

La folla sceglie sempre Barabba! Siamo in un paese troppo tradizionalista, troppo corrotto, con interessi che vanno aldilà dell'onestà... Cmq bisogna accettare il risultato sportivamente e credo che Beppe debba far posto a Di Battista o Di Maio! Sono 1000 volte più preparati di Renzi e questo la gente lo sa! Forza M5S!

Renzi ha vinto, ma con il PD al 44% (o giuddili) in val di Susa qualche dubbio su brogli mi viene), ma, anche se ripeto Renzi ha vinto, chi lo ha votato ha PERSO come noi, e, se da oggi sento qualcuno lamentarsi per prima cosa gli chiedo "" per chi hai votato? "" se non risponde 5 stelle (anche se non è andato a votare), lo copro di insulti come minimo. Non avete o voi che avete votato PD o FI o non siete andati a votare.

Guai a fermarsi ora... questo è il momento di organizzare strutturalmente (e pazienza che questo possa non piacere a molti) un movimento che si candida a diventare forza politica di governo, saldamente radicata nel Paese... un movimento nato (quasi) dal nulla, che fa paura a chi pensa che l'unica soluzione per vivere serenamente sia essere portati per mano... una volta da questo, una volta da quell'altro, evitando accuratamente di attivarsi personalmente... un movimento inviso a chi fa della politica un'opportunità di carriera... un movimento che terrorizza chi non ha capito che non è più tempo di cambiare bandierina sullo stesso tavolo da gioco... ma che è giunto (ed è sempre troppo tardi) il tempo di ribaltare questo tavolo, di stravolgerne le regole... pazienza e perseveranza non saranno mai abbastanza per chi crede che sia assolutamente necessario proseguire questo viaggio, per quanto esso sia impervio e disseminato di trappole...

Caro Beppe, cosa vuoi dal popolo che si fa comprare con 80 euro e non pensa neanche al fatto che dall'altra parte glieli faranno uscire con le tasse ecc? Cosa vuoi dal popolo che si lamenta e poi rivota le stesse persone?.. Come vuoi combattere l'ignoranza??? Questa è la verità... Non c'è niente che non vada nel Movimento. Il problema è L'IGNORANZA DELLA GENTE che non ce la fa neanche a farsi due conti in testa o capire quando la raggirano. Io rimarrò sempre con te, nel bene e nel male! Prima o poi, vinciamo noi!

con queste premesse anche il 20% sarebbe un ottimo risultato.

resistere in tutti i modi alla svendita del paese dovrebbe ora essere la priorità.

Grazie a te Beppe, e grazie a tutti i 5 milioni e rotti, fra i quali ci sono anch'io. Ma, scusate, di che ci stiamo lamentando?! A parte il fatto che non ci sono ancora proprio proprio i dati definitivi (io ho quelli di 61.461 sezioni su 61.592), comunque a me sembra un OTTIMO risultato! Secondo partito, perdinci!!! E DA SOLI, senza coalizioni, stampelle, giornali, radio, TV, finanziamenti milionari: costantemente nuotando controcorrente, contro tutti e tutto, anche contro le telefonate ""terroristiche"" ai vecchietti e i mezzi propagandistici più sporchi. Ma l'avreste mai creduto, pochi anni fa, quando tutti guardavano al M5S col sopracciglietto alzato e il sorrisino ebete sulla faccia, ad un risultato così? E non dimentichiamoci che NON erano le elezioni politiche, alle quali tradizionalmente va più gente, quindi è logico che ci sia stata una flessione del dato dei voti al M5S. E poi c'è stato tantissimo astensionismo, purtroppo, e quindi chi vi dice che alle prossime politiche parte di quelli che ora si sono astenuti, per disinteresse verso l'Europa, poi non votino M5S? Alfano, Fratelli d'Italia/Alleanza Nazionale sono asfaltati, FI è 5 punti indietro, la Lega è al 4° posto con uno stacco di quasi 11 punti da FI (eppure canta vittoria con un misero 6%!), e il M5S quindi dovrebbe mugugnare col 21?! Mah!!.. Dice: ""ma il PD ha preso il 40, il doppio di noi."" Embè? il M5S ""vale"" più di FI, 7 volte Fratelli d'Italia/All. Naz., 5 volte il NCD di Alfano, 4 volte Tsipras, 3 volte la Lega, per non parlare di tutti gli altri partitini con lo zerovirgolaqualcosa! SECONDO PARTITO!!! Io sono contenta, e non lo dico per consolare nessuno. Il M5S è un movimento giovane, e questo risultato secondo me è lusinghiero. Per cui, avanti tutta!!!

Qui non ci sono né vincitori né sconfitti.

NON È UNA PARTITA DI CALCIO.

Ci sono persone chiamate a svolgere un compito di altissima responsabilità e lo dovranno svolgere indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico a cui si sono abbinati.

Che poi la maggioranza di questi lo faccia per denaro è chiaro.

Allora abbiamo due strade nella vita: o viverla onestamente (onestà MENTALE anche, nel senso che uno deve avere il coraggio di dimettersi, se vede che non riesce a raggiungere gli obiettivi), oppure viverla da parassita ignavo ed egoista (come il 90% degli attuali politici).

Ben consci che, tanto, si va tutti incontro alla morte qualunque cosa si faccia nella vita.

E comunque, guardate che aver preso il 20% dei consensi su metà Italia votante e dopo esserci messi contro tutti (il partito unico) è già una gran cosa.

Ci vogliono anni, per riuscire a cambiare le cose. Anni di sacrifici e di lotte, è sempre stato così e lo è anche adesso.

Non molliamo.

DEVI MOLLARE IL MOVIMENTO E SMANTELLARLO.

L'hai detto, e se sei COERENTE, DEVI FARLO.

Io ho votato M5S e ho fatto campagna per mesi, nel mio piccolo.

Abbiamo fallito! La gente non vuole saperne dell'onestà o della coerenza o di altre cose che a noi SEMBRANO importanti.

La gente VUOLE essere governata da questi qui.

Prendiamone atto.

Lasciamo l'Italia nelle mani del PD, di Berlusconi, degli indagati, della mafia, delle lobbies, della Troika e che si compia il destino di questo Paese di mentecatti.

Non si può difendere chi NON vuole essere difeso.

E' FINITA! Prendiamone atto. Io mi sono rotto le balle...

Ben pour exactement la raison que j'ai dite : dévaluer revient à baisser les salaire (et les économies des classes moyennes) de façon dissimulée.

Je ne dis pas que c'est forcément une mauvaise chose de baisser les salaires (ou en tout cas, je ne dis certainement pas, et aucun parti politique ne dit, qu'il faut ""constamment"" les augmenter).  Peut-être bien que la France aurait intérêt à effectuer une correction, en effet.  Mais dans ce cas je préfère un homme politique qui va le dire franchement : « nous pensons qu'il faut baisser tous les salaires, pour retrouver la compétitivité de la France » (et je préférerais qu'il ajoute « et on va tenter de faire en sorte que les plus bas soient moins touchés », mais bon, ça c'est un avis politique), plutôt qu'essayer de dissimuler une opération économique dans la politique financière.

&gt; Parce que ce qui compte au final, c'est la croissance...

Certainement pas.  Je pense que la plupart des Français ne voudrait pas vivre en Chine, avec les conditions des Chinois et la croissance des Chinois.

Moi ce qui me semble important, c'est le niveau de vie médian (ou plus généralement, le niveau de vie d'un certain quantile) exprimé dans une mesure objective.

Il est en effet possible qu'on ait intérêt à « baisser les prix » (i.e., les salaires) de la France pour exporter plus.  Mais il faut être honnête sur ce qu'on fait.

Clinton a été populaire parce que présidant durant une période de croissance, Obama impopulaire parce qu'il a succédé directement à la crise de 2008.

Pourtant je ne crois pas qu'il y ait de consensus que ces événements aient été dus à ces personnes. On a souvent tendance à surestimer l'influence que le gouvernement peut avoir sur l'économie, particulièrement en période de mondialisation intense.

Its kind of like when they sold off their TV spot time before the elections some years ago. (story: TV stations in Germany have to give shorts time slots to political parties before elections. The content of these spots is solely decided by each political party. ""The PARTY"" did an auction for ""product placement"" in their TV ads and had some budget airline win it, and they littered their TV ads with ads, corporate design, and messages of that airline. The main reason of course was to, drastically, draw attention to politicians and parties selling out to corporate lobbyists and it successfully caused a debate about the topic.

true,Ripolin,ZBSVUE,U-E,"&gt; Erasmus ne concerne qu'une infime minorité de la population. Minorité déjà privilégiée qui allait déjà à l'étranger auparavant. Regarde les échanges des pays développés qui n'appartiennent pas à l'UE : ils sont les mêmes.

Minorité privilégiée? Je rigole doucement. Les Erasmus espagnols, portugais ou italiens également. Beaucoup d'entre eux sont loin d'être issus de familles aisées, mais ils ont saisi l'opportunité (*qui se révèle parfois être un sacrifice*) pour partir étudier 6 mois ou 1 an dans un autre pays européen. L'Erasmus, c'est plus de 250'000 étudiants et 30'000 enseignants qui partent chaque année. Un programme similaire existe pour les étudiants dans des domaines techniques, comme l'artisanat.

&gt; Erasmus envoie 33000 Français à l'étranger chaque année. Mais chaque année ce sont 150 000 Français qui quittent le système scolaire sans AUCUNE qualification : pas de BEP, pas de CAP, pas de BAC.... Erasmus c'est que dalle. Parmi les 33000 étudiants qui partent à l'étranger un bon nombre serait de toute façon parti sans le programme Erasmus.

Parce que tout le monde n'a pas eu la chance de pouvoir réussir scolairement ou de trouver les études qui convenaient, il faudrait refuser la possibilité à chacun d'étudier à l'étranger? Le décrochage et l'échec scolaires sont des réalités souvent dramatiques, qui n'ont cependant aucun rapport avec l'Erasmus. 

&gt; Donc on a trop de déficit et trop de chômage avec pas de croissance, mais on est trop riches...

Suis la logique. Si les pays membres d'Europe de l'Est rattrapent leur retard économique, leur contribution au budget de l'Union va mécaniquement augmenter en même temps que les ressources qui leur sont allouées vont diminuer. C'est un investissement sur l'avenir, qui présente certes des risques, mais dont les fruits potentiels sont nettement plus intéressants qu'une politique conjoncturel dont les conditions de réussite sont encore plus incertaines.

&gt; Voui, donc à quoi sert la justice européenne ?

A protéger les acquis et à assurer aux citoyens européens que leurs droits fondamentaux sont protégés. La réforme récente de la garde à vue en France, qui permet notamment la présence de l'avocat dès la première heure de garde à vue, est principalement liée de la CJUE sur le sujet.

&gt; Alors là c'est très malhonnête ce que tu fais. Je dis ""On serait en meilleure situation sans l'UE"". Pas que tout est de la faute de l'UE. Je parle de l'impact de l'UE et de l'euro pris séparément et je donne une source qui montre que l'euro a un impact négatif. JAMAIS que tout est de la faute de l'euro.

C'est vrai que sans l'UE et sans l'euro la situation aurait été meilleure. Le Franc avait sans doute les capacités de résister seul dans une guerre des monnaies face au Yuan Chinois et au Dollar Américain. Mais à quel prix? Un inflation à deux chiffres? Des dévaluations compétitives pour suivre la compétitivité des pays émergents?

&gt; La question est de savoir si l'euro a eu un impact positif ou négatif. Or il a eu un impact négatif. Si on change nos dirigeants, on gardera cette plaie qu'est l'euro. C'est vrai en France, c'est vrai en Espagne, c'est vrai en Italie, c'est vrai en Belgique, et figure toi que c'est aussi vrai en Allemagne et aux Pays-Bas, malgré leur formidables dirigeants !

L'Euro est peut-être une plaie. Peut-être était-ce une erreur, mais en attendant, on doit faire avec. Les conséquences d'une sortie de l'Euro sont beaucoup plus désastreuses (inflation, perte de pouvoir d'achat, perte de compétitivité, etc.) qu'une politique volontariste à l'échelle de l'UE qui permettrait de franchir une étape supplémentaire dans la construction européenne. La solution n'est pas moins d'Europe, mais plus d'Europe. Ce n'est pas en envoyant des députés eurosceptiques ou carrément anti-européens que les choses vont s'améliorer. Bien au contraire.

* Berlusconi ha preso meno voti di Tsipras. FI non ha mai fatto sfracelli in Trentino, ma è un risultato a dir poco imbarazzante, considerando che il paese dov'ero non è certo terra rossa.
* Quasi una ventina di schede contestate, un sacco di gente ha messo Renzi e Berlusconi tra le preferenze. Non vorrei dire cazzate ma mi sa che c'erano più schede sbagliate in questo modo che Fratelli d'Italia, Verdi e IdV messe insieme. Questo dice molto su quanto si è parlato di Europa e di candidati in concreto.
* Affluenza del 60%, sticazzi. La mattina è stata assai deprimente, a pranzo eravamo appena al 10%. Molta gente è venuta a votare verso sera, probabilmente complice la bella giornata. Molti giovani e molti anziani ai seggi, se devo essere sincero la cosa mi ha stupito particolarmente.
* Tutto sommato il risultato di Grillo non è relativamente malvagio. Alle scorse politiche aveva intorno al 10% ma alle provinciali era piombato intorno al 5%. Mi ha sorpreso vedere le pochissime preferenze assegnate dagli elettori M5S, che hanno quasi tutti votato solo la lista.
* Scelta Civica senza il traino di Dellai (che ha dato il suo endorsment alla SVP) non vale una cippa. L'anno scorso SC fu secondo partito nel nostro seggio e andò molto bene in generale. Alcuni dicono addirittura che senza Trentino SC non sarebbe entrata in parlamento (you're welcome, Italy)

* Tanta tenerezza per la lista ""Io Cambio"". Una sola preferenza, pure cancellata in favore di un altro partito (scheda ovviamente annullata)
* Premio elettore dell'anno ad una famiglia straniera che entra al seggio e ne fa la propria casa. Due coniugi ritirano le schede, entrano in cabina, escono con la scheda perché non sanno chi votare, nonostante i ripetuti richiami del presidente di seggio a rientrare non lo fanno, alla fine la signora chiede un'altra scheda perché ha sbagliato ad esprimere la preferenza, richiesta negata. Piegano pure la scheda in maniera sbagliata e se ne vanno scazzati.

But what would then be different well the peasants would still have to work hard all day for little pay and they would still have low life expectations and if there was a bad season there would be some deaths due to starvation.

so maybe the most important thing to change since the dark ages is living standard but im also pretty happy about never having starved or died of an easily preventable disease. ",0,1401098362,null,0,false,0,chrcg5o,t3_26gry3,t1_chrcg5o,t1_chrc77p,null,1433958658,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

The free movement of workers wouldn't be a problem if movement would be roughly equal in all directions. But it's not. It's clearly not. At least 300,000 Hungarians went westward in the past decade or so in search of jobs and better lives. However, we didn't in return get 300,000 French or British immigrants looking for better lives. It's obviously an east-to-west situation and it creates animosity between the ""west"" EU member states and their ""eastern"" counterparts. 

There is a brain drain going on here, with doctors leaving each year because they could make the same salary as janitors in Germany. That removes the Hungarian workforce, which in turn involuntarily sabotages the country's welfare system. Hungary is by no means wealthy, but its welfare system (notably health care) is flawless. But that's because there's a 27% VAT (highest in the EU, I think) and workers pay a lot of taxes on income. Hungary already has a 35% retired population, and each worker leaving hurts the system more. We don't reproduce like rabbits so it's difficult to look past 300,000 workers leaving in 10 years when trying to care for the retired population.

I finished my education last year and never thought of leaving, because I know there are jobs when people are willing to start with much lower than what they expected. I heard it all: family issues, monetary issues, security issues. I'm no exception to those, but I knew that my leaving would hurt the pensioners (who worked their whole lives to earn the help they may lose someday) as well as the next generation. I started with a menial position and now, a year later, a have a steady pay from which my family and I can subsist. I'm by no means rich, but my chance of becoming so one day has not been eliminated.

I love travelling across state borders, but that's due to Schengen, not the free movement of labor. I will support Schengen til the day I die, but I think the free movement of labor was a huge mistake because the return on investment is not a two-way street. Western European states are being bombarded with immigrants who may or may not be willing to integrate and welfare tourists, while Eastern European states (or at least Hungary) are losing their workforce, leaving behind pensioners who are getting screwed over because they will eventually get less of what they were guaranteed a few decades ago.

If there were no socio-economic disparities between the ""east"" and ""west"" EU, I'd say the free movement of labor is a fine thing.

true,[deleted],null,null,"How is freedom of movement of workers a ""racist policy""? All EU countries are part of an internal market, the free movement of workers is a pillar of that internal market (alongside the free movement of goods, services and capital).            
If someone from the UK can come to Romania and have the same rights when doing whatever (from purchasing land to working) then shouldn't there be some reciprocity?            
People from non-EU countries have a harder time coming here because you don't have that level of reciprocity.        
            
I am a Romanian who moved to Sweden a few years ago, and if you think you can just pack your bags, take your passport and jump on a plane and just like that move to a new country, you are quite wrong. Moving to a different country is both a terrifying and amazing experience, and it requires a lot of money and determination. And technically you can't stay more than 3 months in another EU country if you aren't a student or do some economic activity or have funds to support yourself.        
                   
In the end, what's so bad about Polish people coming to the UK? Unemployment when those people started arriving in 2004 was at one of the lowest rates in British history, and by the looks of how UK unemployment is going down these past months, soon companies might actually be in need of that labor.      
       
Of course, since I moved to a different EU country, I'm not that impartial, but that's how I see things.

In the context of having some kind of common market freedom of movement for labour is non-negotiable.

Also conceiving of it as a racist policy is not entirely groundless, perhaps; but so is having free movement of labour for British citizens in the UK. If what you want is a non-racist policy then you're advocating to extend freedom of movement to the entire world, not to restrict it to a smaller arbitrary category that's actually more bound with ethnic and racial groups.

As to the potential issues with large numbers of people changing the demographic composition? Get real. The UK has what, 80 million people, and you're crying about a few hundred thousands?

true,RamblinRambo,FINL,Finland,"&gt;And it's an overblown issue imo mostly put into focus due to the crisis. Regardless I've found European immigrants to be among the more easy to integrate. They don't (have to) pull the refugee card and mostly come for either a specific job or education and if they come for neither they can be kicked out by the country they're in if they don't find work in time.

I don't really agree. Sure the economic crisis has made it a more urgent one, but it's not like the immigration issue didn't exist before the crisis. I'd almost argue that the crisis made it so much cleared what the ramifications of uncontrolled immigration are. Here it's important to note that I'm speaking of non-EU immigration. At least when you look at the unemployment data for the Nordic countries non-EU immigrants are highly over represented in unemployments with respect to their share of the population. I'm not sure what the numbers are for other EU states but I doubt it to be much different. Therefore we could argue that ""recruited immigration"" from outside of EU isn't really the issue here but rather the ones not having a job when they arrive.

What comes to border security there needs to be more cooperation between countries as long as we have open borders within the union. An EU border security agency would not be out of the question at least for me.

&gt;They won't leave on their own and kicking one out does have consequences.

Kicking them out will definitely have consequences and the financial markets will react to it. But is it necessarily a bad thing? I believe that the Greek economy would be much better off without the Euro. It could control its own currency so that it can accommodate its own needs rather than being held back by the ECB.

As you say it will have consequences but have we ever really sat down and put pros and cons down and objectively thought about it? And have we asked for example the Greek people to vote on what they as a country want?

&gt;More vote anti EU then for a smaller EU or whatever they want.

Could it be that many of these votes are somewhere in between the extremes? In say here in Finland no major party really promotes a smaller EU. So the only option you have is either to vote for a stronger EU or anti-EU. It's then quite logical that the ones rooting for a smaller EU decide to vote on the anti-EU party as their main thing is that they as voter do not want to se a bigger more powerful EU.",0,1401099686,null,0,1401100911,0,chrcncu,t3_26gry3,t1_chrcncu,t1_chra0wx,null,1433958751,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Freedom of movement is what makes the EU a social reality, the ability to move from Portugal to Poland without even worry about a passport, border controls or visas.

And that's the thing. You don't see people here complaining about transnational companies and the free trade of capital and goods across the EU members and the fiscal benefits you get for selling your products inside the Eurozone. No, borders for parties like the UKIP or FN are not for banks or rich people, they are for poor immigrants: Poles, Romanians, Greeks...

You want Polish euros, but you don't want Polish people. Do you understand how problematic that is?

Not quite true. Look at Sweden it never had colonies except for [Guadeloupe for a year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadeloupe) and it has one of the biggest immigration flows of non-EU immigrants in Europe. Finland was ruled by Sweden and Russia for hundreds of years, we could have been sitting up hear blaming Russia and Sweden for all our problems. A sentiment that seems to be prevailing in many countries formerly ruled by others. Instead we decided as a country to work hard to make our own future. 

Some decide to stay victims as it is the easier way out. For me this is frustrating. People seem to think of especially Finland as some rich Nordic country that just happened to get everything for free, but man did we have to work hard to get it.

My message for any former colony/province or whatever you may call it is that you either lie complaining that you were treated badly or you pick up your tools and start working. There are no short cuts. But saying this usually brings on a fire storm of ""you cannot compare us to them"", ""our situation is so different"" when it actually isn't. First step to success is to kill off corruption and start sacrificing. Once you've done that you won't be that keen on giving it away either.

if you take the year of you won't have them so they will revoke the visa and good luck trying to get another one (protip: its not gonna happen) .

What I would recommend: (this is assuming you are a US citizen due to the US Bachelor).

apply for a work visa Germany has special agreements with the USA. making it easier and you can file for it from within Germany (you do not have to leave the country for it).

here's the relevant link:

http://www.germany.info/Vertretung/usa/en/05__Legal/02__Directory__Services/01__Visa/__Employment__Visa.html

the biggest hurdle:  employment contract or letter of intent from your future employer in Germany and two copies thereof

everything else you should already possess (passport and a few pictures etc.)

so yeah as long as you have a permanent job just make copies of the employment agreement and go apply for it (takes 1-3 months though so hope you have enough time, otherwise just get a tourist visa thats valid for 90 days.

to save money on that, book a cheap flight to some EU country, enter that country with your passport (check the list which country will let you in with a simple stamp you can get at the airport for a small fee) make a few days vacation wherever you went then fly back to Germany and get yourself a tourist visa here as well. That shouldn't cost more than a few hundred bucks (depending on the hotel quality etc.) and you get 3 months of stay time.

Mes parents se sont séparés au début de mon adolescence au cœur de cette période ingrate, après des années d'engueulades, de larmes et de crises. Ma mère a sombré dans une dépression profonde. Elle a du jongler entre des procès (ex-patron), des déménagements successifs, des hommes peu fiables, des boulots instables, etc. 

Il y a quatre ans, alors qu'elle sortait peu à peu de cette terrible dépression grâce à de nombreux espoirs, elle s'est faite renversée à pleine vitesse par un chauffard qui a grillé un feu rouge alors qu'elle se rendait au travail. Bassin cassé, bras gauche cassé, jambe gauche cassée. J'ai maudis cet enfoiré de toutes les fibres de mon être pour avoir failli tuer ma mère. Mais la vérité, c'est que la vie est injuste, et que personne ne peut expliquer pourquoi. Pas Dieu, ni le Karma, ni quoi que ce soit. C'est ainsi que le monde tourne.

Elle est restée longtemps à l'hôpital. Trop longtemps. Les soins n'ont pas été de premier ordre. De ce fait, elle restera handicapée à vie, autour de 20% je crois. Son mec de l'époque l'a quitté à cause des difficultés sexuelles qu'ils avaient dues à l'accident. Bien évidemment elle ne pouvait alors plus travailler vu sa condition physique, apprenant lentement à s'approprier chaque muscle, chaque membre de son corps au prix d'une souffrance que je ne peux imaginer. 

Nous sommes aujourd'hui bien loin de ces épreuves. Je n'avais pas conscience, adolescent que j'étais, de toutes les merdes qui lui tombaient dessus. A l'heure où l'on parle, elle est en couple depuis quelques années avec un homme attentionné et aimant, elle marche à nouveau, avec une béquille, reprend goût à la vie grâce à des efforts au jour le jour, et profite de chaque instant qu'elle peut passer avec les personnes qu'elle aime. Hier, je n'ai pu lui envoyer (je fais mes études dans un autre département) qu'un bouquet de fleur à son tout nouveau travail pour la fête des mères et lui exprimer mon amour sur un petit mot. Elle en a pleuré de joie. 

Je me rend compte avec le temps à quel point j'aurai pu perdre ma mère, a tellement d'occasions différentes. Mais je suis infiniment reconnaissant qu'elle soit toujours parmi nous, et le fait qu'elle ai surmonté toutes ces difficultés l'a rendu plus forte, plus tolérante, plus aimante. C'est une renaissance que de sortir d'une dépression, et cette renaissance apporte un nouveau regard sur le monde et les personnes qui t'entoure.

Pour ta fille, pour tous ceux qui t'ont un jour accompagnés ou partagés ta vie, je t'assure que le combat vaut le coup. Fais toi aider très rapidement. Tu verra qu'avec les bonnes personnes, ce challenge te changera pour le meilleur, et tu chérira chaque instant passé avec ta fille, et le fait que tu te sois battu pour elle, ou pour les raisons qui semblent valoir le coup de se battre à tes yeux. 

Garde espoir, il faut des moments difficiles pour admirer à quel point on peut parfois baigner dans le bonheur.

Un grand nombre n'est absolument pas communautariste d'ailleurs.  Ils ne se sentent pas du tout représentés par les abrutis du CRIF et autres institutions. Et ces institutions sont les premières à ""mettre tous les juifs dans le même sac"" et à se revendiquer représentantes de tous les juifs.

Aujourd'hui tu peux tout à fait être enfant de parents Juifs et ne pas être Juif. Tu peux être Juif le lundi et pas le mardi. Faut arrêter d'en faire tout un plat quoi.

J'aurais pu être Juif (majuscule donc je ne parle pas de la religion), je ne le suis pas. Certains membres de ma famille sont Juifs et cassent les couilles à tout le monde pour qu'on se convertisse, qu'on coupe la bite aux garçons et pour que les filles n'épousent que des J. avec un catalogue de vieux moches de 35 ans qui habitent à New York et veulent une femme bien soumise de 15 ans de moins qui s'occupe de leurs 5 futurs enfants.

C'est malheureusement de plus en plus fréquent et c'est pitoyable. Le pire étant pendant les mariages juifs où ça part complètement en couille, avec des mots suprématistes (les Juifs doivent guider l'humanité!!!, ce genre de trucs) qui n'ont pas l'air de choquer grand monde.

Quant à Israël, entre souhaiter une terre où se replier en cas de délire antisémite dans le monde et appuyer la politique de colonisation et d'extrême-droite de bibi il y a quand même une nuance possible.

true,RamblinRambo,FINL,Finland,"&gt;Wouldn't limiting migration or segregating the Euro be directly at odds with those goals?

Yes and no.

Social welfare is one big factor that differentiates the US form Europe. In the US you don't have the same degree of social welfare systems of free universities, free healthcare etc. This makes it much less economically hard for a state or in our case country to take in an influx of people from another state. Because we have huge gaps in the levels of economic development between the nations this posts a huge challenge. Shall we allow welfare immigration within the union? What rules should we have when it comes to this? 

The UK system is in much, the least protected ones and has attracted much inter-EU immigration, and many argue because of this. But the inter-EU immigration is still a small issue, the big issue is non-EU immigration. Something that we really need to get cracking at.

Most people don't mind being able to move and work all over the continent. Most people don't mind having free movement of people within the EU. But what they do mind is free movement of non-EU immigrants.

What comes to trade, I don't see anyone being opposed to free trade and a common market. They are issues that even UKIP wants to promote from what I understand. Trade between nations isn't the issue here. And as many say, ""we don't need"" a political union to have functioning trade agreements.

So a non existing EU doesn't mean that it by any means will automatically mean less free trade. If it does it is the people of the countries that decide to have it so, and then it is a decision made by the people and should be respected in any decent democracy.

Also, regarding social welfare and immigration. Countries with similar levels of social security are more likely to allow immigration between each other. In the Nordics we have had passport fee travel and freedom of movement including social welfare since way before the EU. This was possible as the net numbers were interchangeable. Norway didn't get people moving to Norway because of better social welfare systems from Denmark and vice versa. 

People moved mainly directly because of employment. When you don't have anything significant to gain except when you find say a new job you won't be relocating to a new country. Which is way more likely if you're unemployed in a country with little or no benefits and have an open door to a country with a lot of benefits. Directly moving the pressure on the new host country and it's taxpayers. Whereas a person who migrates to work and pay taxes in a country will be generating tax revenue. However, this is only true if they aren't working for lower wages and forcing the domestic population out from work and onto the social welfare system resulting in a lower tax revenue and increased costs. Once again an issue experience even with inter EU-immigration.",0,1401101572,null,0,1401102063,0,chrcy1h,t3_26gry3,t1_chrcy1h,t1_chr7u2d,null,1433958891,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

I don't know.

Also, France and the UK have been countries where a lot of immigrants have come, fom all over Europe first, then from further.

Most of the times, when I have discussions here with people calling me a tree-hugging hippie for not realising immigrants will destroy my society with their foreign ways and dark skin, it's with Finns, Estonians, Czechs... The whole thing of attacking the concept of ""diversity"" is something I had never heard about in France or in the UK, only from scandinavian/eastern Europeans.

Yes, the FN scored yesterday, and although it didn't surprise anyone it's not fun to see. But this is more of a protest vote against the current government and the current state of the EU economy.

you can also look into tutoring. just call a few of the nearest tutoring places (there are plenty of chains) as a native speaker you should have a pretty good shot at getting a job.

just explain to them, that you currently are allowed to work in the country and that all you will require from them is a letter of employment and you'll take care of it all.

Stress the last part YOU WILL TAKE CARE OF IT.

This should be the primary reason people don't wanna hire you. you might think bureaucracy is bad, wait until you get into corporate bureaucracy. its a nightmare of paper.

this site may also help you:

http://www.toplanguagejobs.de/en/

just select English and whichever other languages you speak fluent and select either Germany (if you are willing to look all over the country) or the city you wanna be in.

companies recruiting on that site in general are familiar with visa policies and the jobs are usually limited to jobs that require language skills primarily so it will be a lot of customer service etc.. Site is def. useful if you wanna work overseas. also most companies will be okay with phone/skype interviews.

you could also talk to an recruitment agency that specializes in foreigners. They usually get paid by the company they get you in so they will try to get you a job. 

other alternatives: 

just go to the local hostels etc. and just ask the staff if they are hiring, plenty of English speaking backpackers etc. so odds should be good you'll get a shitty job there to file for the permit",0,1401102152,null,0,false,0,chrd1f2,t3_26i479,t1_chrd1f2,t1_chrcwwj,null,1433958936,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

MEPs can initiate legislative proposals. They do this by submitting a request, under Article 255 TFEU (iirc), to the Commission to come up with a proposal in the area they want. The Commission can refuse, but the Parliament can fire the Commission if they feel it isn't doing what they want. The (new) President of the Commission is elected by the Parliament and her or his Cabinet has to be approved by the Parliament (in contrast to the UK where it is all just appointed with the assumption that the House of Commons will be happy with it).

Maybe it is my legal background (rather than political), but I don't see a problem with the lack of a hard legislative procedure in the EP. The UK's equivalent - the Private Members' Bill - is usually used just to raise a debate; Bills rarely get far and many (like the EU Referendum Bill) are badly drafted; individual MPs usually don't have the expertise to draft good legislation, or the resources to do the required research to find out just what it should say. In the EU, therefore, they sacrifice a lack of ability to initiate legislation for having it all - in theory - up to professional standards initially.

It is also worth remembering that, while in the EU the executive (the Commission) can block a proposal from the Parliament by not initiating one, in the UK the executive (the Government/Cabinet/Prime Minister) can block a Private Members' Bill by vetoing it, or even not letting it be debated (in some cases).

true,Brandmon,MALT,Malta Pajjiz tal-Miki Maws,"Very valid points but I wish to expand a bit further to shed some light on what might be perceived as *nonsensical* with regards to free movement of labour.

To understand free movement of labour you have to consider the economic dynamics. While what you state is correct from a present point of view, it isn't indefinite. The Hungarian economy wouldn't keep experiencing an brain day until it ran out of doctors simply because there is a base demand for doctors. 

The inverse is often true in the receiving country, where it is often argued that such free movement depresses wages from what they would have been if the borders were closed. 

Labour movement always goes from where there is a surplus of labour towards where there is a shortage of labour. Thus, taking a frank example, doctors leave a country for another not only because ""Wages are higher elsewhere"", but because ""I am actually needed elsewhere"". Simplistic I know, and actually wrong objectively. But it is still a partial reason that needs to be taken into account. 

And indeed, for those who decide to stay in their country, is not the outcome better for them? Simply because a 100 engineers graduated doesn't mean that a 100 engineers are immediately employed to the workforce if emigration was suddenly prohibited. Emigration allows for the labour that stays to be valued higher; from a situation where a 100 are competing for a set number of jobs, you suddenly have 50 competing for the same set number of jobs. Thus, for employers, the situation shifts from the all too familiar ""We can just hire the lowest bidder because there is always someone else next in line"" to ""If we don't hire this person for what he is worth, our competitors will"".

Consequently it all falls back to the core argument around the freedom of movement for labour: the wealth disparity. The question was always *How shall we lift poorer countries to become on par with wealthier countries?*. And unfortunately the answer isn't as simple as *Let them lift themselves up* as the conditions are simply not there. Too often such countries don't have access to the same primary or secondary industries that wealthier countries have been built on. Too often such countries are not the most attractive target for major direct investment. And too often such countries didn't inherit the same generational wealth as western European nations did, often gained from an age of colonialism that isn't possible any more.

Over the years two possibilities were considered. The first was to literally throw money at the poorer countries. Throw money at them so they can sustain the same social services and infrastructure on par with Western nations so that suddenly such nations become an attractive place for development and investment. But this would have been quite the financial drain on western nations; a drain I doubt the electorate would find acceptable for now.

Instead, freedom of movement was decided to be the method to address this disparity, where the initially described dynamics would lead to labour costs readjusting themselves and gradually equalising, thus utilising freedom of movement of labour as a means towards narrowing the socio-economic disparity.

Hardly a perfect solution, both in essence and execution. But there are no straightforward answers to complex issues; otherwise a solution would have been long found ages ago. That said, It would be great if you could share what you might think could be an alternative solution for addressing the economic disparity between West and East.

I was swearing at the tv, I'm some bloke from up norf, I would have done a better job than Clegg did making the case for in.

First thing he missed is the diferance in values, if someone is happy to be half Singapore half Switzerland with nukes and banking, cares little for geopolitics, saving the planet and bringing New countries into the western fold then they aren't coming around any time soon.

The only thing that the EU can do for them that the UK can't is stand up to the US and China and win. There are lots of small things you need the EU for like roaming charges going away, that while everyone will like isn't going to swing your veiw on the European project

I would contest there are swathes of things the UK alone wouldn't ever do that the eu might like on food standards and the environment but those who want out seem okay with US standards.

The positive case has to be that its genuinely spreading the first world east. The new accession countries traditionally blighted by autocrats and oppression are all with the possible exception of Cyprus coming along even if some are doing so slowly.

This is all well and good there are a thousand technical reasons to want the EU but it is all head not heart. What brought me around is the new east, Moldova and Ukraine, the western Balkans. Seeing people literally die holding the blue flag, people who aren't even with us yet, its verry moving our flawed bloated perhaps idealistic project is real genuine hope for millions.

We pour billions of aid out every year and almost always it fails. With the EU taking countries in as equal partners, giving them the chance to build up their country eventually making us all stronger letting us do more good. Poland the Czech republic and Estonia are verry good examples.

It is all a bit aloof and while we have Poland we have Greece, and while we faced down ACTA we utterly failed to stand up to Putin. But I must ask would we have done any better alone?

I don't have an answer for that lol. I too don't think throwing money blindly at the countries would help because most of it would end up in three or four pockets. It really is just time that will eventually erode the now-imaginary border between eastern and western Europe. The good news for Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary is that they are neighbors to two very wealthy states (Germany and Austria), so they have good examples to see. The Baltic states (notably Estonia) see how Finland is doing, which is another example to follow. 

The ""let them lift themselves up"" strategy really is a waste, because communism produced a new class of drones who now call themselves the political elite. Most of the left- and right-wingers here have ""red"" (communist) diplomas in law and economics, two things which the communist system disregarded the most. Thus, education would be the only way. But then the question: who would educate them? :/

If the free movement of workers would've been introduced in 2030, it probably would've been a great thing.

**That**'s the salient problem here?

In my mind, the problem is the Turkish occupation, and rather glaringly so. Europe must finally tell Turkey (and in no uncertain terms) that this is ""**not ok**"" and that Turkey needs to take its bullshit puppet regime and to get the fuck out of Cyprus. And then that's that, end of problem. 

But instead of this being what the debate's about, Turkish shills have the unmitigated gall to make complaining sounds about how the poor Turks, (from the Turkish-occupied half of Cyprus mind you!), don't have electoral access even to the other half (the one Turkey is **not** occupying). And for an extra touch of absurdity, they do this by brandishing ""*We want European rights!*"" type slogans.

Thus an active approach in finding ways that would help accelerate that shift is inevitably the best approach. Be it what I mentioned in my previous post, or normalising social services - be it education, health or similar necessities, within the EU so that all citizens can benefit equally from them or anything else that we might not be aware of.

you will likely be interested in Tax category III -&gt; married living together, 1 has high income other has none/low one. split tax, 1 partner pays little the other one pays a lot. very useful when only 1 person works as you pay a lot less taxes.

unless you're religious make sure you clearly state that you are agnostic/atheist and get that documented otherwise you will have to pay church tax.

Health insurance: it is mandatory, not being insured is a crime, so get insurance (usually done through work, you pay a %age of your income)

cost of living index:

http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_by_country.jsp


how to go about it:

find yourself a job in IT and get a work permit, as your wife won't be able to work as a school teacher (she can however still work as a tutor they usually hire if you are practically qualified they do not require certs.) tutor you can expect to be paid around 10 € per 45 min. (~ 13 €/hour) its usually gonna be part time though except you score an english gig (lots of people are qualified for that though).

if you have a work permit you can get a simple permit for your wife. if she wants to get a degree here she can apply for a student visa (allows 20 hours of work a week but also study requirements). 

you may also use a student visa for language courses etc. (so getting into a German language course at an university is perfectly legit for a student visa).

the car payments/rent thats not gonna happen for that little. 

I just had a quick look at rental costs for a house in Nürnberg (4-5 rooms, garden, 100-170 m²) that will be around 1500 €/month + utilities. Util you can expect to pay around 400 a month. 

so if you budget 2000 €/month for rent + util you should be good. 

on the upside, food in Germany is the cheapest in the Euro zone, you should have absolutely no problem buying brands only and a lot of it for around 300-400 € a month

cars now that depends on what you want a new car will usually be in the 20-30k € range I would not go buy a new car buy a decent used one (or 2) those can be had for 2-5k each.

if you live in a city look into public transport, Germany has very good public transport and its a lot cheaper than driving , so if you can get to work etc. with public transport its gonna save you a lot of time and money and use cars really only for shopping etc.

24.000 rent + util

 4.800 food

so thats roughly 30k a year for rent util and food.

Is an assertion that can very much be contested. I voted for the far-left in my country, which consists of Democratic socialists, libertarian socialists, radical socialdemocrats and greens. That's ""exquisite"" in my subjective opinion. 

&gt;until the 1990 the far left was ruling

Until the 1990 the authoritarian left, specifically the stalinist left so the right wing of the bolsheviks was ruling across a series of proxy states. The ""far left"" by itself is practically a useless category. The spanish anarchists, free market socialists, stalinists and ghandi are all far left but one that puts them in the same bag is hardly a meaningful classification. Either way very few european left parties still cling to that political current.

On the other hand when we are referring to the far-right we are referring exclusively to the authoritarian far-right. The libertarian right is very much hated by its philosophical antecedents to the center and to the left but it's hardly considered a threat of the same caliber as the political descendents of fascism and nazism. You don't see people grouping verhofstadt with golden dawn even though both are verilly disliked by the left.

Where the authoritarian left is characterised by good intentions and a destructive lack of pluralism, checks and balances and other liberal safeguards, the authoritarian right specifically stands in opposition to all of these things as intrinsically evil while its intentions of national purity, isolationism (as well as the overhaul of ""dangerous"" pluralism and diversity), and their attitudes of national, racial and sexist supremacy are hardly what we'd call ""good"" unless their message is to be watered down to the point of meaningless abstraction.

Finally, you need not forget that just as many european countries were proxy states of the USSR and felt to their skin the consequences of authoritarian left dictatorships others like Spain or Greece have been ruled by authoritarian right dictatorships that were hardly any kinder to their citizens. The local differencies of the national experience with either side is very important to understand the disposition of those people towards them. For example in my country the leninists (so the authoritarian left) were the primary resistance against the Nazi occupation. If that isn't enough to justify the national disposition towards these sides (one was massacring our people, the other was fighting the conquerors), it's also notable that this otherwise authoritarian far-left had control over more than half of the country by the end of WWII and still opted to invite the exiled liberal politicians back for elections to take place only for what we describe as ""white terrorism"" against its [the left's] proponents to follow, eventually culminating into a civil war and then a dictatorship.

In short the experience with either side is not internationally identical.

Unlike authoritarian systems, libertarian systems require an actual effort from the public as in true acceptance of their goals and understandings of them, they can't just dictate as that would go against their beliefs, henceforth it can be said that the world is not intellectually ready for libertarian far left (in otherwords, world is not ready for LIBERTY - quite possibly one of the most accurate uses of the word).

This is different for ""Die Partei"". For instance: In Germany, political parties have the right to air their political spots free of charge. They can do whatever they want, film with a cheap private cameras, and millions of people will receive their messages. Public broadcast stations will however bann some  political content. For instance you are not allowed to air hate speech. The NPD (far right wing) has tested the limitations of freedom vs. hate speech elaborately and the borders are pretty clear in this direction. Many small parties, without any funding, have tested the limitations of bad, bad filmmaking. However, there is no experience in other fields of inadequate content. When ""Die Partei"" aired a fully pixeled porn movie, I laughed hard on it. Many people who are not following the repeated discussions on a propitiate content for a political campaign, just though it is obscene. But isn't the constant attempts of racists to approach as close as possible to hate speech more obscene? So far ""Die Partei"" is not repeating their jokes and pointed out different things every time. Well, and everyone has a different sense of humour I guess.

Which is itself specious.     
Oh sure, it sounds like it should be right when you first say it out loud but once you've got 28 members all agreeing on something, anything, then you have next to no wiggleroom and you invariably put yourself over a barrel when it comes to negotiations.   

Iceland can agree trade deals with China, New Zealand can agree to mutually drop tariffs with China, but when both India and the UK wanted to agree to mutual financial service deals they couldn't because the EU had locked itself in full nelson over negotiating textiles with India and they couldn't pass one without resolving the other.  The UK didn't care aboout the carpet-rug issue- but that's the thing when you start having to negotiate as a 28 state bloc, by the time you've made a compromise the ultimate will seldom be designed with a single state in mind.  If there was a single, universal EU thing to argue, then perhaps there'd be a case.  The thing is, we all have different needs, economies, interests, and priorities, and it's they that are being shoehorned into a single European identity.

Of course the UK can stand for itself against China or the US outside the EU.  Iceland manages it.

&gt;I would contest there are swathes of things the UK alone wouldn't ever do that the eu might like on food standards and the environment but those who want out seem okay with US standards.

That doesn't make sense either.  The UK had its own food standards before/outside the EU.  Lots of countries do.  The UK can do that.  Doesn't mean it has to suddenly start copying US regulations.   Just as when we want to trade with Australia, or when Canada wants to trade with China, or Russia with Brazil.  They don't require political union.

Having said that there's nothing to say there can't be standardisation treaties outside political Union.  Farage himself has said he could get behind that.  Again, doesn't require being in the EU.

&gt;This is all well and good there are a thousand technical reasons to want the EU but it is all head not heart. 

But the EU is trade protectionist like a customs union, not a free trade agreement.  UKIP wants to remove international tariffs on Africa to help build up mutual trade and development.   The EU prevents it.

So far I'm not getting one technical reason to be in the EU which can't be done from outside.

&gt;Seeing people literally die holding the blue flag, people who aren't even with us yet, its verry moving our flawed bloated perhaps idealistic project is real genuine hope for millions.

The EU is complicit in what is happening in the Ukraine.  The German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said the EU shares part of the blame for Ukraine crisis.  UKIP representatives themselves warned before Christmas that they were encouraging a coup which would have wide ramifications for Ukraine.   Cameron talking about expanding into the Urals is not helping things.

&gt;We pour billions of aid out every year and almost always it fails. With the EU taking countries in as equal partners, giving them the chance to build up their country eventually making us all stronger letting us do more good. 

It's even more wasteful!   

The EU commissioner himself even admitted that the EU Cohesion Fund, a third of the budget, had been distributed with no coherent planning behind it.  They just threw open a pork barrel and corporates jumped in.

It's far easier for the UK to reform itself than it is for the UK to reform itself and 27 other countries, many of which are happy to be building, quite literally, roads to nowhere.

&gt;It is all a bit aloof and while we have Poland we have Greece, and while we faced down ACTA 

Ahem, it's back in the EU-Canada deal.  The unelected mandarins to the EU commission brought it back behind closed doors.  And once it's back and has been slipped into an international treaty dressed in billions of trade agreed as a single 28 state bloc then it's not like you can just have a vote of no confidence in a government and change it.  Now you've got to break as well with the other 27 countries.

&gt;we utterly failed to stand up to Putin.  But I must ask would we have done any better alone?

The EU gave Putin the excuse to go into Crimea!  It certainly wasn't in the UK's interest to encourage Western Ukrainians to topple an elected government.

Would it have been better if we were alone?    YES.

We have a very good thing outside the EU that deals with big aggressors coming from over the Urals and it works.  

It's called NATO.  

The EU ignored all that and decided rattling chains outside NATO in former Warsaw Pact territory and now they're wondering why a Russian bear has woken up.

It's not just Ukraine.  The EU is doing it in Belarus too.

If you're looking for trade ties, diplomacy and co-operation then I challenge you to find a better example that the EU. As disenchanted with it as you may be, I think your contention that we are stronger alone is absurd. Soon the US/EU free trade agreement (TTIP) will be agreed, and the EU has a far better track record on not backing down to whatever the US tells them to do than we do alone. Even if we could get a free trade deal with the US (which is not even on the table) there is no chance we would have the bargaining power that the EU does and we would be stuck with the worst parts of the deal, like corporation litigation.

Beispielsweise standen Dinge wie ein Bürgergeld im Programm, Steuervereinfachung, Bürokratieabbau und ähnliches. Dinge mit denen ich mich identifizieren konnte (das liberale Bürgergeld halte ich zwar für zu komplex, aber es wäre immerhin mal ein Schritt in die richtige Richtung). 

Von all den sinnvollen Dingen wurde aber nie wirklich etwas in Angriff genommen. Stattdessen hat man etwas Klientelpolitik betrieben und Steuersenkungen um jeden Preis gefordert (die sie zum Glück aber auch nicht umsetzen konnten). Das einzig Sinnvolle was ich in Erinnerung habe war etwas liberalere Netzpolitik.

Die Partei hat für mich an Profil verloren und hat alles getan, um dem Klischee der Gutverdiener-Partei zu entsprechen. Das ist zu wenig, um meine Stimme zu bekommen. 

Für mich ist diese Partei heute das Sinnbild der Profillosigkeit und ein Mahnmal dafür, dass es in Deutschland keine wirklich liberale Partei gibt. Am nähsten kommen dem programmatisch vielleicht die Piraten, aber von denen erwarte ich auch immer weniger...

Für mich wäre nicht nur entscheidend, was im Wahlprogramm steht, sondern dass sie wenigstens auch Engagement für die ein oder andere Reform zeigen. Wer vor Machtpragmatismus triefend jegliche Utopie als ""nicht realisierbar"" verwirft, ist ersetzbar. Ich habe jedenfalls für dieses Jahrzehnt genug von der FDP und bin froh, dass sie jetzt erst mal eine Denkpause im Bund haben. Vielleicht nutzen sie die ja sinnvoll. Ich würde mich freuen.

If they had any real chance of succeeding in their aims, it might be worth looking into what radical concrete changes they planned to make, but until then their only real power is likely to be a push to raise taxes on the wealthy and other checks on an unregulated free market.

All deaths in systems like the USSR are attributed to malevolent, conscious, subjective choices.

People still starve, but their starvation is either squarely their fault or noone's fault, something equivalent to the deaths caused by an inescapable physical catastrophe. The capitalist market can not itself be held accountable for anything.

It's a nice bit of cognitive dissonance.

And?... That's a national issue isn't it. The thing most eurosceptic parties are on about is immigration within the EU. Romanians terking jerbs, etc Also the ECHR blocking them from taking all nationalities away when it comes to UKIP which has really nothing to do with the EU.

&gt;What comes to border security there needs to be more cooperation between countries as long as we have open borders within the union. An EU border security agency would not be out of the question at least for me.

So are in fact for more competencies for the EU on certain fields which sounds like a drastic contrast with things you've said before.

&gt;Kicking them out will definitely have consequences and the financial markets will react to it. But is it necessarily a bad thing? I believe that the Greek economy would be much better off without the Euro. It could control its own currency so that it can accommodate its own needs rather than being held back by the ECB.

At the moment with the debt they currently hold they'd go bankrupt. No cotnrolling their currency and get better from the moment they leave. Straight up bankruptcy Basically now their debt is pretty much guaranteed. They won't collapse and this limits the interest rates. If they leave that guarantee is gone. Their interests would skyrocket  and devaluing their currency would only make that worse because the debtholders loose money.

Now you can argue that defaulting is good for them in the long run but I wasn't talking about Greece alone I was talking about the Eurozone and each and every one that's next in the line. You take one out when it goes bad. It defaults. And who in their right mind will give money to the next one that may have problems. You create a domino effect that won't be restrained to just southern Europe.

So either you quit all of it ditch the euro and everything surrounding it or you continue where you went wrong and where you were too afraid to continue the last time due to ""muh sovereignity"" and stop select members like Greece from becoming the focus of a crisis..

&gt;And have we asked for example the Greek people to vote on what they as a country want?

They can do that in their national elections can't they. If they want out they can always decide that on a national level as nobody is keeping them captive. I doubt they want to default though especially as the recession is finally slowing down there. I don't think going back to a 2008 scenario is what they'll like.

&gt;Could it be that many of these votes are somewhere in between the extremes? In say here in Finland no major party really promotes a smaller EU. So the only option you have is either to vote for a stronger EU or anti-EU. It's then quite logical that the ones rooting for a smaller EU decide to vote on the anti-EU party as their main thing is that they as voter do not want to se a bigger more powerful EU.

and again that's more of a national issue than an EU one isn't it. The fact that your parties don't provide you with a middle road is no argument against the EU. Some member of the Finnish center party considered joining the reformists but ended up not. You can always start such an alternative since it's a democracy after all but of course it isn't that evident.

Maybe you'd think differently and would like it all more if there were EU wide parties that stood on their own and you can vote easily for some Flemish reformist but again most ...no nearly all countries wouldn't like that and one can easily see why.

true,graendallstud,FRAN,France,"This explanation may be true only for France (I don't know thye political situation of other countries well enough): because what we call ""far left"" has far less common points with the communist regimes of the past than the ""far right"" has with the fascist/tradictionalist regimes of the 30s to 70s.    

In France, you could qualify the Communists, the NPA, FO and some Greens as being part of the far-left. Communist and Greens are republicans (i.e. in favor of a multi-party system, and they have had ministers in the past 30 years in socialist governments), and NPA and FO are not really leaning toward a dictatorial system (although many in these parties, which earned 2% of the votes, would not been insulted if accused of wanting a proletariat dictature). Not really your ex-URSS or Cuban-loving proto-dictators.    

Now, if you consider the ""far right"", although they would deny the qualification of ""fascist"", they are proponents of a isolationist and nationalist system akin to the Franquist regime in Spain or the rule of Salazar in Portugal. While most of them deny the ""racist"" qualifier, they oppose people between the ""français de souche"" and the ""français par acquisition"": basically, do you have pure french blood (or at least are originated from a catholic country, Italian, Belgian, Spanish or Polish descendants are quite accepted) or not (i.e. your grand parents were born somewhere in Africa)?. And they would go as far as say to you ""go back to your country"" if they consider you're not ""french enough"" (which would apply to people whose parents at least were born in France, and in the case of families originated from Algeria, where your ancestors for the last 2 centuries were born in France).    

The far-left stalinist-leaning is dead in western Europe, and has not had a real impact since at least the early 80s (in France, it would be with its participation in the first government of Mitterand in 81); timely, the far right started to grow back in the 80s in France, with Le Pen.

Because British politics are stagnant. No major changes.

It is imo not how democracy should work. If they were actually in any real danger of loosing votes they'd have given that referendum ages ago.

Now what's weird to me is how you can apply this British political way of thinking to the EU level and expect a European party to change their stance in some way

The federalist idea of the unification of the people and nations of the old world into a cohesive whole that can stand on its own in the international territory, the formation of a secondary common extra-national identity for the european people.

The Supreme being, the prime mover, eternally and necessarilly existing, omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent, of divine simplicity, creator and sustainer of the universe, perfectly rational and source of all morality and moral obligation.

&gt;Communism

A stateless, horizontally organised society where the means of production are socially owned and self-managed by their workers, where money has been substituted by a non-exploitable standard of value like labor notes, where wealth allocation is done in a gift-economy where abundant goods are distributed freely and non-abundant goods according to contribution, where production is planned by the federated worker associations.

Furthermore, many far-left parties campaign for various progressive policies, and are often willing to adopt new policies or discard old ones. Therefore if a party describes itself as 'far-left' it doesn't actually tell you almost anything about its political views.

In contrast, when a party describes itself as far-right, in 99% of the cases it will adhere to the *ancien regime* values: nuclear family, universal order, national justice, protection of private property. Any forces within or without the nation-state hostile to these values will be opposed by any means necessary. For this reason it is near impossible to make deals with the far-right, because their programme is set in stone. At the same time, it is historically the far-right which caused problems in Europe. Stalin only came to take control of Eastern Europe because of WWII, started by the far-right.

The status quo is unacceptable, and we seem to have reached a point where nothing is really happening anymore in the process of eliminating the problems. If another major recession starts now, they're just going to have to improvise again to see what ""sticks"", but never really fixing the underlying causes or deficiencies of the structures.

The message the EP election results gives me is that everyone is fed up with the ""wobbling along"". As far as I'm concerned the options are only two:

- Fiscal transfers / common debt / some form of political union (in the eurozone) to keep it all together.. a mandate of the ECB to have a job target like the Federal Reserve does may also be nice.

or

- Break up the eurozone and allow each country to tweak their purchasing power and import/export balances passively the way they think is best for themselves. Sure, some of them will probably screw it up -- but it shouldn't* be everybody else's problem at that point.

I personally will not tolerate another decade or more of this ""wobbling along"".

true,modomario,BELG,Belgium - Flanders,"You seem to misunderstand. I'm not frustrated with Brits. I like you guys. I like you guys and would love you to take a role as one of the group leaders in the EU with which the others can somewhat align to form blocks because as long as national matters still play a big role they might as well. I think that's what the EU needs if national interests remain an important factor. Not just France and Germany.

I'm however frustrated with the British political system which with it being stagnant forces people like Farage in the EU to get something done on a national level. Not only because it affects me in Belgium as an EU citizen but because it's a shitty system for the Brits themselves too.

In other countries I'd just consider it a stupid if similar were to happen as it often walks in line with the national stances. (Here VB the main eurosceptics were struck down on the Flemish, the national and the European level.)

In Britain though I can't even blame the electorate because the system they're voting in is just silly and populism 'the idea that the politicians adapt to opinion shifts so they can keep filling their pockets is' expected.

Here in Belgium the political landscape adapts to the opinion shifts. Not 3 ruling parities and their established politicians.

No wonder Brits are so disappointed with ""the establishment""

It sounds so fucking silly when Farage comes in and declares the EU undemocratic whilst he's only there because he can't make a change on the national level.

Well, you'd still want to trade with the EU. I mean, who in his right mind would ignore the biggest domestic trade zone in the world with 450 Million people (not counting the UK), right? Of course you'd want to trade with the EU and keep a door open for the many British companies who do business in the EU, and the many global companies who view the UK as their door to the EU.

So, what is your plan? Leave the EU and negotiate hundreds of treaties with the EU that grant you access to the benefits you are interested? You can do that, but do you really think that this will be easy? Do you think that you would be the ones who are calling the shots? That the UK would be the strong side in the round of negotiations with the EU or any other power-block and major trading zone in the world?

Switzerland is often cited as a role model for the UK. But don't think that the EU harmonizes European standards and regulations with Swiss standards! To participate in and benefit from the freedom of trade and movement inside the EU and the heavily regulated trade zone, they have to accept liabilities under the terms of the EU, not the other way around. And it would be the same for the UK.

You want access to the European labor market and its qualified workers? No problem, just accept freedom of movement under the terms of the EU! You want to do business with and inside the EU? No problem, just accept the EU standards and regulations! 

Bottom line: Leaving the EU would only weaken your position in negotiations, not only with the EU but with every major block in the world. If you want to do business with the EU, you would still have to accept its standards and regulations. The only difference: You would have no say in the decision making! And if the EU makes a decision that harms British manufacturers ... well, shit happens! 

Your problem is that your media and your perception is full of misconceptions about the EU. The point of the EU regulations is not to rob the member states of their sovereignty but to remove barriers between the markets and create a standardized and harmonized trade zone (and by the way, many of these regulations already existed before the EU). Thanks to the EU industries from Finland to Portugal, from Scotland to Greece only have to met one standard and not 28 different standards, no matter if these standards are about the quality of products, about doing business or the movement of labor. Removing these standards and the freedom of trade and movement would plunge the EU into chaos and pave the way for the extremists.

What's disproportionate about it? Overall, between 2% and 6% of people identify as anything other than heterosexual, probably closer to the lower bound.

What's interesting right now in Romania is that the far-right lacks charismatic leaders. In 2012, PRM dropped out of Parliament and were replaced nearly 1:1 by PPDD, a sort of silly populist party (a point on their platform was the govt will give 20,000 euros to each citizen or something like that). But the guy (DD) lost his television's license, so his party lost traction (no visibility).

So now you have Mircea Diaconu (an actor with some shady things in his past) gathering votes for almost two seats, probably mainly because of the recent controversy surrounding him (that kept him on TV).

If my reasoning is correct, all this only shows that the votes for the far-right around Europe don't mean that everybody went nuts, it's just that people try to vote with ""somebody else"" and it just happens that the far-right is there with the populist message.

after PDL lost power it split into satellites that divided their support base.

PSD, used this context, the fact that they have a strong media outlet and the fact that they are the ruling party to gain most of the former PDL electorate. The actor was heavilily promoted by that respective media outlet so that 7% is basically in the pocket of the PSD.

PNL taugh that they will inherit PDLs electorate, because of share a similar ideology, they left the alliance with PSD(a couple of months ago) and joined the opposition with this gamble in mind.

But the lack of a clear strategy and the reactionary nature of their leaders messages made them revert back to their fixed base electorate. 

PDLs strategy of splitting up and going after populists nationalists and right-wing voters with a different party, could have been a good thing, because they maintained the second place seat attainable for the presidential elections. If you add up, the votes of their satelites they would surpass the PNL.

Looking foward to: A reform of the PNL, there are currently to many vultures and to little actual power so they are fighint over who gets the last piece neglecvting the fact that the people see them as elitist politicians with no credibility.

A popularity contest among the anarchy of the presidents camp(PDL), it is very probable that he will step in and clean up because he needs that presidential seat in his camp to get the premiership.(the president gets to apoint the prime minister, a ""Medvedev"" play if you will).

PSD has this in the bag, the economy is running, no big issues in the foreseable future and the control a strong media outlet, the just need to not fuck up(and cause contrarian suport for the oposition) and they'll (finally) get the presidential seat (back).

The left does the same. To the left, the ""other"", the enemy is the ""oppressor"" - the rich, the ""white cis men"", patriarchs, whoever else. It is a very similar process, just the right looks downwards when searching for others and enemies and the left looks kind upwards.

&gt;The racism is different there; it's more casual, publicly acceptable, and ""known to be true"" - hard to phrase.

You don't understand something. The very term ""racism"" was invented by British colonialism, inherited by America, but does not really apply here. First of all because we tend to be ethnicists, not racists: that means that most states were explicitly ethnic nations, not civic nations not so long ago. They were explicitly meant as a homeland for an ethnic group. Then this slowly changed but it is not clear how far it went. This really conflicts with the inherent multiethnicism of US history right from the beginning.   Basically it is not race, it is ethny, and it cannot be compared. America is not about one ethnic group, anyone regardless of ethnicity can be American merely by accepting the values that define the country. But many European countries are - historically at least - explicity ethnic. You cannot be fully Polish, Finnish, Hungarian or Bulgarian by simply getting the appropriate passport. If you are not assimilated into that ethnicity, you always stand out.

This is why a civil rights movement here would mean bloodbath most likely. It is entirely different that people who happen to have a different skin color demand equal consideration in a country that is explicity not ethnic and even those black people don't have an ethny anymore (they forgotten if they are Yoruba or Ibo); and it is again different if it in an ethnic state people who are not of that ethnic group and are basically guests get too loud. It would become more dangerous for them because they cannot say it is their country too, the whole history is not so. 

I know this very well as a Hungarian. Many of our ethnic group lives in Slovakia, Romania etc. due to historical reasons. I want them to have more rights, but I would warn them form getting too loud or trying a civil rights stuff or really challenging the majority. They are only tolerated, they are not full citizens of a country that was made for a different ethnic group - and if they get too loud they could easily lose that tolerance and get massacred.",0,1401109756,null,0,false,0,chrei48,t3_26glxo,t1_chrei48,t1_chqvyie,null,1433959626,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Très désabusé de la politique depuis un moment, j'ai partagé ce constat, et je me suis mis à faire des choses que je considère politique, hors des partis et des institutions. Pourtant, malgré mon désaveu et mon désamour, je vote encore. Pourquoi ?

Parce que un vote ne sert pas à construire. Il sert à endiguer. Je ne m'attends pas à ce que les personnes à qui j'ai donné mon vote changent le monde. Ce n'est pas ça le but. Le but c'est d'empêcher l'accession au pouvoir des destructeurs dont notre histoire est remplie (et je ne parle pas là que de la seconde guerre mondiale, mais de plusieurs épisodes de l'histoire riche de la France depuis 1791) 

Je comprends tout à fait ceux qui disent ""je m'en fous de la politique, moi je construis."" Mais ta construction sera emportée comme les autres quand la digue cédera. 

Si tu n'as personne pour qui voter avec enthousiasme, tu as sans doute tout de même quelqu'un contre qui voter. Même en se bouchant le nez, apporter une pierre à la digue aide.

Fais comme les presque 19% de personnes qui ont voté pour une petite liste: trouve quelqu'un, même de ridicule, pour faire baisser les scores des autres, vote pour un idéaliste ou une petite question qui te plait. Par exemple 3% ont voté pour Nouvelle Donne, qui a un programme sympa, surement sans grand espoir mais pour dire ""on voudrait ça"". 

Il ne faut pas demander à la démocratie plus qu'elle ne peut donner. Son seul but est d'empêcher l'arrivée et le maintien de tyrans. C'est très insuffisant comme moteur de progrès mais c'est tout de même indispensable.

Ca pourrait être intéressant aussi s'il y avait une solidatiré européenne, mais les autres ne jouent pas le jeu (ex: la Pologne a préféré acheter des avions américains plutôt que français, ce qui a provoqué la colère noire de Chirac).

La mondialisation n'est pas la même pour tout le monde, les pays émergents n'ont pas accepté les ouvertures libre-échangistes qu'un commissaire non élu a négocié en notre nom.

Désolé mais les hypothèses apocalyptiques viennent de ceux qui depuis 20 ans nous ont assuré que l'euro nous apporterait la prospérité et le plein emploi : ça n'a plus aucune crédibilité. Et ca ressemble furieusement à l'argument des soviétiques, ""il faut toujours plus de socialisme"".

* È vero che Renzi ha accelerato i tempi perché Grillo si sarebbe mangiato Letta (per quanto Letta abbia saputo tener testa a Berlusconi con la fiducia, mica cazzi). Credo sia anche vero che Renzi ha vinto le primarie perché i votanti avevano paura di Grillo (Cuperlo? Cuperlo?? CUPERLO???).

* È vero che Renzi è democristiano e ha riportato al PD molti voti democristiani finiti a PDL prima e UDC/Scelta Civica poi.

* Se diamo per assunto che i voti di NCD siano tutti di Alfano, è vero che il PDL non ha perso _tantissimo_ rispetto al 2013 (lì sì che era crollato invece).

* È vero che Grillo ha sbagliato strategia di comunicazione. Il problema è che per un voto che prenderebbe senza sparate, ne perderebbe un altro.

* È vero che il centrodestra come coalizione ha perso al massimo il 2-3% (vedendo la fine di Scelta Europea, scommetterei che la maggior parte dei voti di NCD siano di Alfano e non di Casini).

* È vero che Renzi vince, al contrario dei precedenti leader PD, perché è _anche_ populista. Le auto blu su e-bay sono populismo. Però non è solo quello. Il quarto video è l'unico dove veramente Travaglio parte per la tangente.

Quello che Travaglio omette è che il M5S è all'opposizione per sua libera scelta (anche con un governo di minoranza sarebbe stato all'opposizione ma con ben altro ruolo).  E Berlusconi sarebbe decaduto comunque (Genovese pure, neanche i trucchi col voto segreto sarebbero stati possibili visto che il PD ha il 55% alla camera).

Being poor doesn't give you the right to take dumb decisions. Poor people aren't ""dumb"". They still have a brain and can still think.   You can still be poor and be part of a social democratic party. Those parties were founded by poor people.   Is FN going to change something in Brussels to help the poor people in France? You also shouldn't forget that a large share of poor people in France are actually foreigners.  Where's the solidarity between poor people? White Frenchmen  vote for a party that is openly xenophobic. It's hard to take ""but I'm poor"" seriously when they vote for something that'll hurt a huge group in France.  FN isn't going to help Moroccans who live in poverty. If anything they'll help French citizens with French ancestry. That's how it's going to be.  FN is no solution. People do have the possibility to launch their own party. Group up and form a ""Party for Wealth"". If you are serious with your issues you will try to solve them. Blaming Germany, Europe, black people isn't going to make them less poor. It makes them look like poor idiots.

Fascists = bad people. I'd say that you agree with that statement. If Fascists = bad then not being fascist = good.  Easy as that.   To be superior I'd have to be above something that is visible.

true,OccultRationalist,null,null,"Wilders isn't just an anti-EU party though. He's anti-Islam, anti-Moroccan, anti-immigration, anti this, anti that. I think if he had a better idea of what to improve instead of aggravating issues between native and non natives he would have a better position to do what he wants. Especially his anti-Moroccan chant put a big dent in his voter base with no positive returns aside from getting in the papers again.

The fact that anyone with a memory of more than a couple years can clearly see Geert Wilders radicalizing doesn't help either. Before he was talking about how the problem isn't with Islam (although is does share part of the blame) but with radicalism. He made it very clear then that he wasn't against muslims, or specific races, but against radicals. 

It is indeed his extremism that puts him in the crackpot corner which is why a lot of people don't like voting for him. He knows people see problems (social isolationism because of immigration) but instead of looking for a solution, he instead decides to remove the problem for the native population and escalate the problems for the immigrants.

This is actually pretty sad in that the slow revival of ""harmless"" nationalism (more of a social solidarity) is tainted because of this. A lot get radicalized and support the PVV because ""your own people should come first"". It's very ironic that while there are definite frictions between immigrants and natives, the attitude portrayed by people like Wilders will only make it worse for both parties.

true,randoff,ANAR,It's too dark in here. Someone turn the lights on.,"Sure, I can agree with this sentiment. But then again the capitalist market itself is a form of social organisation and wealth allocation chosen by each independent society. A command economy is also a form of social organisation and wealth allocation (and these two aren't the only possibilities at all), it's also a faceless function if you want to see it that way. It's not dependent on any specific individual and yet it produces undesirable results. The same can be said for a market system.

On the other hand you can personify the command economy by equating it to the higher-up state officials making the most meaningful choices, but that can also be said for a market system which (albeit more decentralised in general) still centralises most production and allocation choices to specific individuals.

Further still, a market is a series of social relationships formed between owners of objects coordinated by the profit motive. The generalised form of social organisation compels their choices, sure, but we can still trace all outcomes back to the market actors. That generalises the culpability for those outcomes a lot, but it can't extinguish it.

My point is that you will find subjects and objective functions in any mode of organisation/production and the two of those together always cause the outcomes in a society.

&gt;And?... That's a national issue isn't it. The thing most eurosceptic parties are on about is immigration within the EU. Romanians terking jerbs, etc Also the ECHR blocking them from taking all nationalities away when it comes to UKIP which has really nothing to do with the EU.

It's not a national issue. Once you're in the EU you can move freely. So,e countries are more easy on giving permanent residency rights than others and once they do there isn't much stopping them. Some like Malta are giving citizenships to the highest bidder. Once again giving the buyer full access to the EU without much more than a years residency in the case of Malta.

Inter EU immigration is also an issue when our economies are so different. You are allowed access to local social security if you decide to move and work in a different country but there is no regulations on what price you are getting paid to do that work for. Meaning that low cost labour is forcing out domestic labour while enjoying the benefits of the social welfare system. Reducing tax revenue from income tax but still resulting in more costs to the welfare state.

This is also an issue the EU desperately needs to address. It wasn't a major problem before the eastern expansion. In the Nordics we had free movement and social welfare between our nations long before the EU. It worked as we were economically equal also on the level of social welfare and income levels as well as cost of living. 

&gt; Straight up bankruptcy Basically now their debt is pretty much guaranteed.

Bankruptcy has many benefits to it and therefore it is very much used in the private sector as well. Looking at the history of the Greek state if we take Greece as an example it wouldn't be the first time. Allowing nations such as Greece to join the monetary union was a big mistake. The proper due diligence was never made as the dream of the EMU overtook the reality of things. An exit by the Greek state from the Euro would be a cost but in the long term it would greatly improve their possibility to get back on higher feet as a sovereign state and it would improve the euro zones ability to do what it was meant to do.

Furthermore it is not really the same to say that the EU parliament vote or national parliament votes are the same as a referendum on if or not a nation should exit the union. In a referendum the people get to decide I one issue and not the complete political spectrum for a whole parliamentary term. 

Brushing it all off as national issues will never solve anything and will only result in a status quo that will boil over one way or another. What I don't understand is that pro-EU supporters say that the EU is the future and we can have a federation when they're not even prepared to accept that people have differ opinions and let democracy decide on each major issue rather than just parliamentary ratifications.

That's not companies. EVERY human organization ends up run by a small elite of people. There'll be different types of feedback cycles and ideas bubbling up, but ultimately even a football team of 10 year olds has a hierarchy in it. So nothing special about the economy here.

&gt; And the interests of the workers are opposite to those of the CEOs.

What the fuck? Are you nuts? I **am** a CEO. You know what are my actual concerns?      
a) Lets make a product customers like      
b) Lets make it better quality than competitors, and more rugged than competitors     
c) Lets hope we create enough value for customers that we can get a decent profit for what we do      

I assure all our workers area very much aligned behind all of these ideas. Their salaries are fucking meaningless to me if our product doesn't sell. Also: if we make a poor enough product that customers refuse to pay a decent price for it, it's not like their salaries are a choice for me - I can't pay with what I don't have.

&gt; there really is no way to defend authoritarianism in the workplace

Except for the fact that authoritarian workplaces are practically always more efficient than non-authoritarian ones. You do realize that anyone can start a non-authoritarian workplace whenever they want. Get a group of friends and start a consulting company for example, and you don't even need titles. Awesome.

Funny thing how none of those stay alive, either going bankrupt or introducing hierarchy. Why do you think that is? All the tens of millions of entrepreneurs in the world are arseholes?

&gt; Even though the workers do everything

Fuck you. I'm in a typical company (read: founder run) and I assure you I've created 10x more value than any employee we've hired that isn't a major equity holder by now. So no, the workers do not ""do everything"", that's just plain wrong.

&gt; Also, you appear to defend trickle down economics.

How did you come to that conclusion? I do not defend trickle down economics in any way. Reality is more like ""trickle up"" because it's the poor who can't hold on to their money, whereas the rich can both afford and often are more inclined to saving.",0,1401111515,null,0,false,0,chrey89,t3_26gry3,t1_chrey89,t1_chrb421,null,1433959837,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4
true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;Well, you'd still want to trade with the EU.

Of course.  

You don't have to be in the EU to trade with it, or to even have a free trade deal with it.   

Former Secretary of State for Trade under Gordon Brown, and former secretary-general of CBI has even said candidly that if the UK were to decide to leave they could probably have trade deals with Europe in 24 hours if they wanted.

&gt;So, what is your plan? Leave the EU and negotiate hundreds of treaties with the EU that grant you access to the benefits you are interested?

Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty gives us 2 years, but the Union of European Federalists has already said that they'd support giving the UK Associate Agreement status which means a trade deal and opting into certain cultural, scientific programmes.

In the meantime we'd already have a trade deal with the EU outside our Statute of Rome agreement which became Maastricht and the Lisbon Treaty.  We're already a signed member of EFTA outside our EU signatory.

&gt;Do you think that you would be the ones who are calling the shots?

Most of the shots have already been called, and they're tied by the WTO competition rules to not act persecutory.

&gt;Switzerland is often cited as a role model for the UK. 

LOL.   Nothing against Switzerland but we could have a UK model, not a Swiss model.

Even the federalists are saying that we could have AA status and go from there.

&gt;To participate in and benefit from the freedom of trade and movement inside the EU and the heavily regulated trade zone, they have to accept liabilities under the terms of the EU, not the other way around. And it would be the same for the UK.

The EU has plenty of free trade agreements without political union.    

We have no say in US, Chinese, Indian, South Korean, Australian, Canadian,...,..., regulations either.  You want us to meet EU decided regulations when we trade with you?  Fine.  The 5% of UK business that currently trades with the EU will know they'll have to meet EU regs when dealing with the EU.  The rest of the SMEs we can dial it down a little and make it more competive for the wider world!

&gt;You want access to the European labor market and its qualified workers? No problem, just accept freedom of movement under the terms of the EU!

We'll take the access without the freedom of movement for people, thanks.  

We'll just offer work visas and advertise jobs, and if Europeans want to come they can apply.

See, access to the labour market without having to open borders to a free for all.  Simple.

We already do it for countries outside the EU.  We have absolutely no problem accessing the Indian labour market, for example.   

In fact, we could actually make it easier for Commonwealth and anglophone countries if we didn't have uncontrolled immigration with half a billion EU citizens.

Work visas.  Dead simple work around.

&gt;Leaving the EU would only weaken your position in negotiations, not only with the EU but with every major block in the world. 

Scaremongering.   

The UK isn't indicative of the rEU, and the rEU isn't indicative of the UK.  Countries that are more fluid, more flexible, more dynamic are doing much better jobs at making their own personally tailored trade deals.

Aaaand if it is a case of dealing in a bloc then we can have a bigger one in the Commonwealth which doesn't require political union (and most of their legal systems are based around ours anyway).  So we got that base covered too.

&gt;You would have no say in the decision making! And if the EU makes a decision that harms British manufacturers ... well, shit happens!

Same with the rest of the wider world outside the EU.  No say there either, but I dare say the EU won't be wanting to make bone decisions for themselves, so the idea that it's just going to harm the UK is specious.   

If they want to trade with the EU they'll meet EU regulations.  I dare say you'll do a great job deciding them.  If they want to trade with the US or China, or vice versa, then we'll keep with their regs and they with ours.

We'll just be more competitive, cheaper, and more flexible - so British manufacturers should be just dandy with all that and the UK making its own trade deals outside the EU.  Plus we get to drop our own tariffs and tax our own imports, tax which currently goes to the EU.

&gt;Your problem is that your media and your perception is full of misconceptions about the EU. 

No, I'm okay thanks.

I want trade.  I want friendship.  I want sovereignty.  To ease up some unnecessary costs and regulations on domestic trading SMEs which needn't be so burdened, and to lower some energy bills.   Then to make the most of some of a far wider global trade outside tariffs and trade protectionism of the EU's custom union.

I'm not arguing the EU is the Whore of Babylon from The Book of  Revelation.  I'm just saying we personally can get all the good stuff without going into a political union or even federalism; that we've kinda outgrown it and it, if anything, is holding us back.  

If you're not at that stage yet, or if you're committed through a spliced currency, then fine, stick with it.  But that doesn't apply to the UK.

&gt;The point of the EU regulations is not to rob the member states of their sovereignty but to remove barriers between the markets and create a standardized and harmonized trade zone (and by the way, many of these regulations already existed before the EU). 

Oh there's much more than regulations.  There's directives.  There's the ECJ.  Even the EFTA courts are far preferable to the ECJ.   At least you're guaranteed a former UK judge who knows about UK law when presiding over a UK matter (and they get more scope for interpretation).

&gt;Thanks to the EU industries from Finland to Portugal, from Scotland to Greece only have to met one standard and not 28 different standards

Great.  The UK can use that when trading with the EU.  It will make things easier.  When not dealing with the EU we will make our own more liberal rules.  Probably won't be banning menthol cigarettes because they're Dot Cotton's brand.

&gt;Removing these standards and the freedom of trade and movement would plunge the EU into chaos and pave the way for the extremists.

EU's doing a good case of paving the way for extremists already it would seem.

-------------------------

After all that there still isn't anything good which we couldn't do outside the EU.

Erm, not really. A full *decade* before the UK joined the EU, this was part of the ECJ's case law:

&gt;The Community constitutes a new legal order of international law for the benefit of which the states have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields and the subjects of which comprise not only member states but also their nationals. Independently of the legislation of member states, community law therefore not only imposes obligations on individuals but is also intended to confer upon them rights which become part of their legal heritage. These rights arise not only where they are expressly granted by the treaty, but also by reason of obligations which the treaty imposes in a clearly defined way upon individuals as well as upon the member states and upon the institutions of the community.

Not to mention that the extant treaty at the time - Rome - and our accession treaty both had prominent clauses at the top calling for an ever closer union.

I don't think it will because I fear the new surge of euroscepticism will slow that down even more. If we are still in similar situation when the next crisis hits (and I don't think we'll reach the fiscal integration needed) and we've in the meantime dropped Greece not only will they have had their short run of misery but every other nation that receives a critical eye from the market(likely the south again)  and is still is in the eurozone will get it even worse. Because hey, the last time that happened the country left and defaulted on it's debt.

You also seem to forget what this defaulting means. It's not only some random rich guys that will be hit by Greece defaulting. Much of that debt is held by eurozone members who will receive a hit to their fiscal status as well which might trigger a whole new crisis.

&gt;Furthermore it is not really the same to say that the EU parliament vote or national parliament votes are the same as a referendum on if or not a nation should exit the union. In a referendum the people get to decide I one issue and not the complete political spectrum for a whole parliamentary term. 

And a referendum is still a national issue. The EU can't start some referendum out of the blue. The national government can.


&gt;Brushing it all off as national issues will never solve anything and will only result in a status quo that will boil over one way or another.

I agree with the later but as I said not with the former. The EU can't hold a referendum. The national governments can. You want one? Look at your national government and ask them why it isn't there. 

&gt;What I don't understand is that pro-EU supporters say that the EU is the future and we can have a federation when they're not even prepared to accept that people have differ opinions and let democracy decide on each major issue rather than just parliamentary ratifications.

Je pense que les politiciens ont largement profité de leur pouvoir pour d'une part décider eux mêmes leur avenir, de leur train de vie, de leurs mandats, et de leur immunité.

Tous les scrutins sont ramenés aux présidentielles (y compris les legislatives).

Bref, a force de déresponsabiliser d'un côté et de ne pas appliquer ses promesses d'autre part, on se retrouve avec beaucoup de déçus et beaucoup de gens qui abandonnent leur citoyenneté.

Je comprend tout à fait qu'une personne n'ait pas que ça a faire que d'ouvrir les programmes des partis ou perdre sa soirée a regarder Pujadas pour voir des promesses en l'air et finisse par abandonner.

Lots of choices on how to do it here. Also, these keep getting disrupted by new entrepreneurs. Or do you think a committee in Brussels would have come up with Google? Or self driving cars? Or hugely cheaper rockets like SpaceX? The list goes on.

Entrepreneurs are what move this planet forward, and basically we reward them with increased power for their success so they can drive it forward even faster.

true,ibrawest,null,null,"&gt;That's not companies. EVERY human organization ends up run by a small elite of people. There'll be different types of feedback cycles and ideas bubbling up, but ultimately even a football team of 10 year olds has a hierarchy in it. So nothing special about the economy here.

We are not saying for there to be no managers or overseers. They can be voted in just as in a democracy and they can help run the everyday operations but they will not decide what are done with profits, how things are produced, where produced, and what produced. The big issues.

&gt; I assure all our workers area very much aligned behind all of these ideas. Their salaries are fucking meaningless to me if our product doesn't sell.

Sorry to break it to you but when workers don't have democratic power in the company they don't really have a vested interest in those ideas. 
nd. And not to be an asshole, but the workers see you as meaningless as well. They could do your job collectively. If All the CEOs and capitalists vanished tomorrow believe me things would be fine, but if all workers vanished things would go to hell.

&gt; Except for the fact that authoritarian workplaces are practically always more efficient than non-authoritarian ones.

 we don't really care about making them that efficient because all that means is more profit for the shareholders. I would also need a source for that.

&gt; Funny thing how none of those stay alive, either going bankrupt or introducing hierarchy. Why do you think that is? All the tens of millions of entrepreneurs in the world are arseholes?

Ever heard of Mondragon? There are thousands of other examples and actually I have read that coops have a better start up rate than capitalist businesses. I'll try to find a source for that.

&gt; I assure you I've created 10x more value than any employee we've hired that isn't a major equity holder by now.

You're not doing productive work. You're not helping to produce goods and services. You're just trying to figure out how to sell the goods and services which is a very new job position in human history and so obviously not needed.

Oh and basic income for the EU in the election spot (Not to mention studying politics, beeing  in the SPD for 6 years before... so textbook career politician) Edit: Yes, she also tralks about transparency, neutrality, copyright...

* #2 You have guy whose twitter profile is ""social liberal Pirate against facism"". (If that was really important for me The Left has been an option since forever)

* #3 Open Government, married to Wikileaks spokesperson etc.

* #4 Musician &amp; Producer actually working with copyright

* #5 Anti-Fascist Action supporter (women) with focus on immigration and asylum ([Pretty much one of their biggest fuck ups](http://bilder.bild.de/fotos-skaliert/femen-37080523-qf-34787212/2,w=650,c=0.bild.jpg) **NSFW** *titts*)

The problem? First of all 2.5 of the top 5 candidates bascially have no focus at all on the founding ideas of the Pirate Party. Then the best two candidates are on postion 3&amp;4. Position 5 is a candidate that should never have been anywhere on a list of the  Pirate Party.

Néanmoins ce qu'il avance dans cet entretien est extrêmement intéressant.

A propos de la ""destruction de l'attention"" par le marketing et la société de consommation :

&gt; Aujourd’hui, le marché inonde la sphère publique de « concepts marketing » qui court-circuitent la pensée et tuent la vie politique.  

&gt; Le marketing détourne le désir de ses objets primordiaux (parents, proches, savoirs, culture) vers la marchandise. Pour cela, il capte l’attention comme l’expliquait Patrick Le Lay, ex-PDG de TF1 : « Mon travail, c’est de vendre à Coca-Cola du temps de cerveau disponible. » Or cette captation détruit l’attention, qui est la forme ordinaire du désir, lequel régresse ainsi au stade de la pulsion. Le désir prend soin de son objet ; la pulsion détruit son objet.  

&gt; La destruction de l’attention pousse de plus en plus de gens vers le Front national parce qu’elle fait souffrir ceux qui la subissent tout en les empêchant de comprendre de quoi ils souffrent. L’attention est produite par l’éducation. Mais si on peut et on doit la former, on peut aussi la déformer. Le marketing la déforme en la manipulant avec d’énormes moyens. La formation de l’attention produit des savoirs – savoir vivre, faire ou conceptualiser. Politesse, chaudronnerie et mathématiques sont des formes d’attention. La déformation de l’attention est le désapprentissage de ces savoirs. Privé de ces savoirs, on est privé de place sociale : on n’est plus soi-même un objet d’attention. Les électeurs du Front national souffrent de cette destruction de l’attention psychique et du manque d’attention sociale qui en résulte.  



Et concernant les prémisses d'un modèle qui transcenderait le modèle consumériste actuel grâce à l'essor et à la puissance d'internet :

&gt; Tandis que le consumérisme s’effondre, un autre modèle émerge, dont ni la gauche ni la droite ne disent un mot. Le rapport Gallois est à cet égard consternant. Les infrastructures numériques configurent depuis l’avènement du Web un modèle industriel qui ne correspond plus du tout à celui du XXe siècle parce qu’il dépasse l’opposition fonctionnelle entre production et consommation. La gauche n’en dit et n’en fait rien par manque de courage et de confiance dans l’intelligence des gens qui ne demandent qu’à penser et à se retrousser les manches pour fonder un nouveau monde – en particulier la jeunesse. Les gens veulent des concepts politiques porteurs d’une vision, la France veut savoir où elle va, et seul le courage de recommencer à penser et à inventer permettra de répondre à l’angoisse qui fait la fortune de Marine Le Pen. Le nouveau modèle participe à la fois de ce que l’on appelle l’économie des données, la production logicielle libre, la production matérielle décentralisée avec les fab labs, les smart grids en matière énergétique, etc. Ce modèle [...] peut être mis au service des pires politiques commerciales, comme le fait Facebook. Mais il ouvre des perspectives extrêmement prometteuses – pour autant qu’une action publique novatrice en crée les conditions de solvabilité. Cela nécessite de mettre en œuvre une politique du numérique requalifiant de concert et avec les Français toutes les politiques ministérielles et relançant ainsi une véritable stratégie industrielle pour le XXIe siècle [...].

&gt; It has nothing to do with immigrants. They are human beings aswell.

No shit they're humans but that's beside the point. Sweden should prioritize it's own citizens first. Every country should prioritize its own citizens first because why else would we have different countries? Many Swedes feel betrayed by the government who let a lot of immigrants in which in turn dumps the salaries.

&gt; To say that the immigrants are stealing our jobs is an idiotic thin to say.

I haven't said that. A lot work in low education jobs, some not at all, very few in higher education jobs. All around its a loss for Sweden because of housing and grants. The taxes the people who do work doesn't come from immigrants from MENA countries, they come from immigrants from Germany, Finland, Norway, Denmark, The netherlands etc. To say ""we can either have all immigrants or none"" is stupid because obviously we have hard working immigrants who we need, and people who barely works at all.

&gt; In about 30-40 years, or when you are going into retirement, we have to rely on immigrants to take care of us because our working population in declining.

Maybe but those immigrants would come from Europe, not MENA countries.

&gt; To answer on your second point, the housing shortage, is only relevant in the big cities (which Sweden has like 2 or 3 of). There are shitloads places to live in smaller cities.

No way. You don't even know what you talk about.

&gt; A solution is to accept the immigrants into Sweden and then let them live somewhere else than Stockholm. Because a lot of illegal immigrants are almost forced to stay in Stockholm.

This is the most idiotic solution I've heard. You're saying instead of regulating immigration we should increase it because people come into the country illegally? None of the immigrants can afford any place other than the million project homes. We have capitalists housing real refugees (not relative immigration) who live in bad conditions.

&gt; The conclusion is that the immigrants are not the problem. The issue is the govenments indecisiveness when it comes to how to create jobs.

You have no idea what you're talking about and you're stuck in a dream world. Wake up, this is reality. This isn't your imagination where everyone wants to be peaceful and is good and can get along.

Besides the problem with the current government is that they're moderates who just prioritize big businesses before anyone else. They've spent billions on bad projects to get people into jobs and every single one has been not just a loss but a huge loss, both in time and taxes.",0,1401113329,null,0,false,0,chrfgfy,t3_26glxo,t1_chrfgfy,t1_chrb1k2,null,1433960077,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

The Red Army voted in the lower officer ranks. Then they attacked Finland in the Winter War.

Curiously enough they got rid of the practice of voting for petty officers after that. Weird. It's like it didn't work very well?

&gt; how things are produced, where produced, and what produced

Decided by the paying customers - the workers nor the CEOs have much say about these things, except in trying to guess the overall customer mood. A great CEO is really a ""guesser in chief"" who intuitively can guess what their true boss - the consumers - want. See Steve Jobs for an example of someone who had a very good instinctive feel for what customers might want.

&gt; profits

I hope you realize all our pensions come from corporate profits ultimately. Or pretty much all of them anyway. So if workers take all the profits, there will be no pensions.

I also wonder how you'd treat, say, Elon Musk or the guy who came up with the Dyson vacuum cleaner (after a long period in purgatory). Same salary as the janitor or what?

&gt; Sorry to break it to you but when workers don't have democratic power in the company they don't really have a vested interest in those ideas

We are actually doing something meaningful and some of us like making the world a better place for its own justification. Also, none makes much less than $100k at the company, so workplace satisfaction is tied to rather different things than just salary.

I dislike finance as a profession bit because of the outrageous compensations etc, but I'm knowledgeable to admit that the chaos that would be caused by all bankers vanishing overnight would be **INSANE**. Ditto CEOs and capitalists, the epitome which is the ultimate join role: the founder-CEO.

true,Curufir,null,null,"Okay, let's give this a go from a UK perspective. 

In my view the core of the problem is a lack of European identity. Some members of this forum are fully on-board with the idea of European brotherhood and hold their EU citizenship equal or superior to their nationality. This is not a prevalent view in the UK. In fact it's far more likely that someone from the UK will view EU citizenship as little more than a few extra rights on top of their UK citizenship. This means that immigrants entering the UK from other European countries aren't viewed as fellow citizens, they're viewed simply as foreign nationals. Hold that in your mind because that difference colours everything about this issue.

Historically the UK has had waves of immigration. However, whether those immigrants were from the West Indies, India, Pakistan or elsewhere they were expected to ultimately become British. Our society's customs moved a little and in return demanded that their personal customs moved a lot. It was, and still is for non-EU immigrants, a kind of social agreement that through this process they would eventually become accepted as British (this has not always been successful). A fairly simple concept and it applies in many countries.

Now enter freedom of movement. This wave of immigrants has no intention of becoming British. They have moved, in the main, for economic opportunity not for any aspirations of citizenship. They aren't devils with horns or seeking to do anything but better themselves, but they also aren't really interested in shifting closer to the native population. From the point of view of the native population there are suddenly hundreds of thousands of foreigners importing their own society into the country in apparent rejection of that which exists. The host nation appears to become a tool for personal gain, abandoned should greater opportunity arise elsewhere. Whereas the previous waves of immigrants would ultimately be absorbed by the host nation, these new immigrants remain forever alien.

This is where freedom of movement has issues. It is designed to bolster the concept of EU identity through increased interaction, but because that identity is so weak it actually engenders self-defeating animosity. Should the EU continue to exist then the issue will disappear with greater value given to EU citizenship. Who cares if someone moves to your street if they are just a fellow citizen? But it won't be quick, and it won't be without tribulation.

Freedom of movement actually brings another problem specific to EU identity. The movement of liberal, educated workers to the north west of Europe means that this is where the nascent EU identity is going to be given bones. The problem then lies with what happens in the nations to the south and east which don't see any immigration? It's going to be hard to sell them an EU identity that they will not recognise as their own. At that point I'd expect to see right-wing influence rise in those nations as national identity supersedes an EU identity they do not associate with.

TL;DR Freedom of movement without EU identity causes animosity.",0,1401113992,null,0,false,0,chrfnhp,t3_26ie3m,t1_chrfnhp,t3_26ie3m,null,1433960167,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

This ""argument"" really pisses me off.

It's one thing to not be present all the time when you only have 3 representatives in the EU Parliament: your vote pretty much doesn't count.

Now that they have 24 representatives and opportunities to form an actual group, there is no way to tell what they will or wont do. Except if you're some kind of a clairvoyant I suppose.

true,Delheru,FINL,Finland,"&gt; As I said, yes, you can defend an authoritarian workplace. But you can't if you're in favour of a democratic system of politics.

Of course I can. There's a huge difference: one is a monopoly, the other one isn't. Democracy sucks and markets are far better. IE, I dislike the Finnish government right now, I shall be ruled by the Norwegian one and pay them taxes for now.

Alas, with governments, monopoly of force etc, this doesn't really work. I can't live in Espoo and swap to the Portuguese government because I'm sick of the Finnish one.

Once there's a monopoly, the market stops working, and you have no choice. Now you have to go for the best of the bad options, which is democracy.

You can quit jobs, you can change the supermarket you use etc far, far, far easier than you can change countries. Ergo, democracy.

&gt; Then, appearantly, you're not the run-of-the-mill CEO. 

Actually, I probably am. There are fundamentally 4-5 types of CEOs:     
a) Public company CEO            
b) Large private company CEO     
c) VC backed startup CEO (I'm one of these)      
d) SME CEO      
e) Self financing compaany CEO         

Now, ""a"" are super visible. Hell, they are what everyone thinks of when you say ""CEO"" as that's the cream of the crop. Kind of like if you say ""Mayor"", people might think of Bloomberg. That doesn't change the fact that these  people are very, very rare.

There might be thousands of people in categories a, b and c globally. Maybe even tens of thousands.

There are hundreds of thousands in ""d"" and *millions* in E.

If you take everyone that runs a company, put their name in a hat and pull one out, you will most likely find someone that runs a restaurant or a hair salon. Those are the most common types of company chief execs.

The baby is a little in danger of going in down with the bathwater when you're making decisions about CEOs based on what is maybe 0.1 - 1% of the CEOs on the planet... (they also aren't responsible for all that much economic output)

&gt; About the trickle-down economics thing: because you advocate lower corporate taxes (or that's how it seemed).

Corporate taxes don't imply trickle down in any way. After corporate taxes are paid, none has any money yet - it's still in the company. I like letting companies invest in things.

What you need to control is when people try to move money from companies to people. If I suggested capital gains (which is the main gatekeeper between corporate profits and individual wealth) should be removed, NOW I would be advocating trickle down.

I feel capital gains and income taxes should be synced up. Hell, in many ways they should be the same thing.

Then throw in some tax incentives to fund start-ups (lots of countries have these) so that taking risks to take on big companies will properly pay off, and voila, you have a pretty decent financial system.",0,1401114897,null,0,false,0,chrfxjv,t3_26gry3,t1_chrfxjv,t1_chrfm9s,null,1433960299,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

The Regional Aid Commissioner on the 2007-2013 €347bn fund said, ""The focus was more on the absorption of funds than on their actual impact.""

The head of the justice directorate-general Director questioned the EU's official figure for stolen funds, saying ""the real [annual] figure is closer to billions than to millions.""

So not only are hundreds of billions being squandered, billions themselves are believed to be going missing altogether.

They're being so free and easy with it because they're no directly answerable to the electorate and then everybody is jumping in in a frenzy to claw back as much as they can.

But he did grow up learning German at home, which is probably why.  That being said, his American accent is 85% Californian and 15% Scottish (he went to Uni in Edinburgh).  So it is possible to have one accent when speaking one language and another when speaking another. I think fluent also relates to accent, not just vocab and grammar.  I think the point of the spectrum is that the Dutch are easier to understand when they speak German than the Americans if they are both speaking with their ""native"" accents.  Of course an American who works at a German accent, not just the German language, will be easier for a German to understand than an American who is not aware of their accent. 

And interesting tangent here.  I find that non-native English speaking Germans often can understand each other better when speaking English with each other than when speaking to a native English speaker, even when you consider the speed at which a native speaker speaks.  This is more apparent when you have, for example, a Frenchman, a German, and a Dutchman in a room with an American and a Brit (sure, sounds like the start of a bad joke but it is really the case in a lot of the conferences I go to).  The three from the continent will understand each other better, in my limited experience and exposure, than they will understand either the Brit or the American.  Not only speed, of course, but also colloquialisms and adherence to certain formalities that a native speaker may not remember or care about.  Also word choice.

Among the most noticeable accents in French you have Quebec, Belgium, Swiss, Northern France (""Chtimi"" and ""Picard"" accents are pretty much indistinguishably close, as these two share a very similar dialect), Southern France (""Provençale"" in the South East, and ""Occitan"" in the South West accents are quite different), Eastern France (""Alsacian"" accent is Germanic in nature for obvious reasons, it is especially prevalent among old peoples), African accents (they probably differ but I would have a hard time telling which is which as I lack experience with these) and Corsican (sounds a bit like ""mafia"" accent, I had a Corsican uncle that always sounded like a French speaking version of the Godfather). 

We also have a ""cité"" (poor suburb) accent that is very noticeable and is generally (and unfortunatly) an handicap when looking for a job as this accent is associated with ""ghetto"" culture.",0,1401115513,null,0,1401116279,0,chrg4ki,t3_26iivj,t1_chrg4ki,t1_chre4xr,null,1433960391,12,false,france,t5_2qhjz,12

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democrazia_Cristiana#De_Gasperi_to_Moro
«Major land reforms were carried out by Christian Democracy in the poorer rural regions in the early postwar years, with farms appropriated from the large landowners and parcelled out to the peasants. In addition, during its years in office, Christian Democrats passed a number of laws safeguarding employees from exploitation, established a national health service, and initiated low-cost housing in Italy’s major cities»

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democrazia_Cristiana#Ideology

«The original centrist and liberal-conservative leadership [...] was soon replaced by the progressives led by Amintore Fanfani. They were opposed to a right wing whose main leader was Antonio Segni. The party's left wing [..] Most of them were social democrats by European standards.»

P2 in Italy was a covert lodge operating illegally (in  Italy secret associations are banned). There is absolutely no way to compare a party with an high popular support that saved Italy in the post-war, against an illegal association secretely operating to make a coup to subvert italian democratic institutions.

An independent central bank is not dependant on political winds by default. It's main task is to ensure growth and inflation targets and this it can do better if the economies are more homogeneous. Now the situation is such that you have economies such as the Greek, Spanish and Portuguese that aren't really moving nowhere. We have economies such as the Germany that despite a strong quarter show signs of slowdown and Netherlands, Nordic etc. which show lesser economic growth than they should. The ECB is between a rock and a hard place. It has extremely weak economies and economies that are about to break because it cannot do two things at once. This situation will be the exact same wether there is a right wing leadership or any other. The fundamental question here is if the Euro zone needs to be reformed. Separating the zone to two currencies would also be an option which has been discussed among economists. Two central banks for two different currencies would allow similar economies to be under umbrellas that suit their needs the best.

I personally cannot see the Euro working like it is today. It will most likely fall apart at some point due to internal or external factors. It as it is now is too weak to defend its existence.

&gt;And a referendum is still a national issue. The EU can't start some referendum out of the blue. The national government can.

The EU can decide that they won't make a decision before a referendum has been held. If a nation opts to not do so then no decision will be taken. Then that nation has to answer to the others why it refused to do so.

&gt;If I was in charge Britain would have had it's referendum yesterday but their politics are stagnant, solidified and imo bound by their FPTP model and their leading parties didn't have too much reasons to admit to a referendum in the past

They told us that they will help us rebuild our country that was devastated by one of the worst forms of communism in Europe. They made us pass laws that positively discriminate our ethnic minorities that now have more rights than us.

I don't think the majority of the people in Europe would want any of that. Most, including me, would love to help our fellow Europeans to get back on their feat, on their own terms and on their own time. Forcing the country to change laws like you say in favour for empty promises is wrong. It just comes down to this ridiculous political-correctness-cancer that seems to have taken a hold of the whole western world. Some kind of colonial hungover that is supposed to affect us all even if the majority of us had nothing to do with it. The whole leftist ""kumbaya"" mentality where everyone will forever get along is eating us up from the inside.

For all I care Romania should be allowed to deal with it's domestic issues in a way it seems to best suit them. It is not up to Brussels or any other person that doesn't need to live with a problem to make those decisions.

&gt;Also they backed the most corrupt politicians in our country and that ignored the will of the people when we tried to change them. Eu destroyed our economy and transformed us in a market for Eu goods.

This is a point that should be made much clearer. Many of your countrymen even in this sub sing praises of the EU on a non-stop basis. I think that Romania wasn't ready for the EU. If we would have had a genuine interest in helping Romania we'd invest and trade with Romania but not enforce some EU-imperialistic political pressure on Romania forcing Romania to take decision it doesn't want to take.

&gt;And now they want to jump ship because of the mess they created.

Sincerely agree with you. The whole Eastern Expansion was a major mistake that will come to be the end of the EU. The majority of the Eastern countries were not ready. So blaming you for problem is wrong, it was ""our"" creation. But now ""you"" are a problem due to moronic decisions made by our politicians. There's big difference there. The east isn't a problem because of it being the east. The east is a problem because the west allowed in when we knew it was going to be a problem.

true,ThunderstruckGER,EURO,Europa,"&gt;Eine dramatische Warnung. Die EU sollte den Ländern Kompetenzen zurückgeben.

Ja klar, das alte Märchen, dass die EU nur Souveränität nimmt.

Ich sage nur eins: **Souveränitätsgewinn durch Souveränitätsverlust**. Die Staaten verlieren zwar in einigen marginalen Gebieten (Verbraucherschutz, Vorratsdatenspeicherung!), oder auch größeren Bereichen (Wirtschaft -&gt; Schuldenfrage und Solidarität) einiges an Souveränität, allerdings gewinnt der Bürger dort seine Souveränität wieder, wo der Bürger in der EU das Parlament wählt und dort, wo der eigene Staat ganz im föderalistischen Sinne auch in der EU-Politik mitmacht. Das heißt: Nicht nur andere Staaten beeinflussen über Brüssel das eigene Land mit, sondern man selber auch die anderen Staaten mit:

Das passiert zb im Ministerrat, dem Europäischen Rat und dem Ausschuss der Regionen, die von der Arbeitsweise sehr international sind. Der Souveränitätsgewinn wäre natürlich noch größer, wenn das Demokratiedefizit der EU gebrochen wird. Aber da bin ich ziemlich sicher, dass das in der nächsten Zeit behoben wird.

Außerdem ist die EU dort von Nöten, wo der europäische Zusammenschluss erst das nötige Machtpotential mitbringt, um die Fähigkeit zu entfalten, Änderungen des (wirtschaftlichen) Systems effektiv und vereinheitlicht umzusetzen, ohne dass dann zb wirtschaftliche Wettbewerbe zwischen EU-Ländern stattfinden. (bspw. Finanztransaktionssteuer oder Regulierung von ""Steueroasen"" zumindest innerhalb der EU, allgemein: Regulierung des Bankensektors.)

Der Bürger gewänne durch eine demokratischere (-&gt;und damit stärkere) EU also auch wieder einiges Souveräintät gegenüber der (Banken)Wirtschaft, was sicher überaus hilfreich für die nötigen Reformen wäre. Die Souveränitätsbilanz ist keinesfalls negativ und der nächste Schritt zu den Vereinigten Staaten von Europa über das stärkere Parlament würde der Souveränität des Bürgers gut tun.

&gt;Selbst als Boni-Banker oder Schulden-Staaten mit dem Geld des Steuerzahlers gerettet wurden, gab es dort keine echte Debatte.

Ja vielleicht, weil sonst alles noch schlimmer geworden wäre? Das witzige ist jetzt, das als Argument vorzuschicken, die Supranationalität der EU zugunsten einer stärkeren (lies: zu starke) Föderalität zu brechen. Obwohl dann gleichzeitig das oben angesprochene Machtpotential der EU als Regulationsapparat der Banken mit gebrochen wird und die Nationalstaaten ja bitte auch mit Steuerzahlergeld retten würden, wenn es wieder nötig wäre. Wär also ein sinnloser Griff ins Klo.

Diese Logik hat sich mir noch nie erschlossen.


Insofern: schon ziemlich bezeichnend, wie sich der Artikel bei all seiner Plattheit auch noch schafft, selber zu widersprechen xD

&gt;Viel wichtiger sind der gemeinsame Binnenmarkt als Motor für eine dynamische Wirtschaftsentwicklung und in der Zukunft eine gemeinsame Außen- und Sicherheitspolitik.

-&gt;

&gt;Brüssel ist nicht stark, wenn es alles vereinheitlichen will, sondern macht sich lächerlich, wenn es jedes Detail regeln will. 

Wie geht ein Binnenmarkt ohne Vereinheitlichung? Man, wie debil :D

Naja, hab jedenfalls das Gefühl, der Autor weiß -ähnlich wie seine Zielgruppe- weder, was der konkrete Diskussionsgegenstand ist, noch, was er eigentlich dazu sagen will.

&gt;Die EU darf nicht länger eine Einbahnstraße sein, sondern sollte Kompetenzen an die Mitgliedstaaten oder die Gemeinden zurückgegeben. Europa müsse vom Kopf auf die Füße gestellt werden, das in Vergessenheit geratene EU-Prinzip der Subsidiarität müsse wiederentdeckt und durchgesetzt werden

Im ganzen Artikel wurde halt auch kein Beispiel für diese mysteriösen Kompetenzen genannt. Ich streite nicht ab, dass es diese zu Unrecht angeeigneten Kompetenzen gibt -vor allem dort wo die Kommission institutionell gegenüber dem Parlament viel zu stark ist. Aber was mir so spontan in den Sinn kommt, finde ich ehrlich gesagt besser bei der EU aufgehoben, als bei den Nationalstaaten.

And I have you to know that uhm... Subsidiarität nur dort sinnvoll ist, wo die unteren Hierachieebenen Aufgaben auch **effektiv** lösen, bzw **überhaupt** lösen können. Ich behaupte, dass bei die EU supranational bei vielem besser arbeitet, als es international-subsidiar der Fall wäre.

Ohne die EU als Diskussionsforum würden Sachen wie die Finanztransaktionssteuer ja wohl **nie** durchgesetzt werden. [Nur durch eine noch demokratischere EU mit einem starkem Parlament mit Gesetzesinitiative ](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finanztransaktionssteuer#EU-Finanztransaktionssteuer)(Auch bei Steuer- und Außenpolitik!), kann man derartige Kraftakte schaffen.

Auch ganz witzig, wie es gerade die Internationalität der entsprechenden EU-Organe ist, an der eben beispielsweise die Finanztransaktionssteuer scheiterte. Ähnlich verläuft es mit anderen, sinnvollen, regulativen Maßnahmen.

Ich für meinen Teil wäre jedenfalls froh, wäre die EU demokratischer und damit noch ein wenig stärker.

But because the SPÖ refused to work with the FPÖ he was in a really powerful place (Since SPÖ-FPÖ won't happen the only two options were SPÖ-ÖVP and FPÖ-ÖVP)  and made a deal with the FPÖ that he becomes Chancellor (usually the strongest party provides the Chancellor) in return for including them into the coalition. After that they refused talks with the winner SPÖ and if the winning party can't form a new government the duty moves over to the 2nd.  It was a very smart but sneaky way to become Chancellor as the leader of the only third strongest party. 

The sanctions actually should be in """", in Austria this is commonly overlooked. It was basically a refusal to include Austria on the political stage, isolating the Austrian gov. officials. 

[Statement about the Sanctions](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanktionen_der_EU-XIV_gegen_%C3%96sterreich). Sorry there is only a German wiki entry. 

&gt;Die Regierungen der 14 Mitgliedsstaaten werden keinerlei offizielle bilaterale Kontakte auf politischer Ebene mit einer österreichischen Regierung unter Einbindung der FPÖ betreiben oder akzeptieren; Es wird keine Unterstützung für österreichische Kandidaten geben, die Positionen in internationalen Organisationen anstreben; Österreichische Botschafter werden in den EU-Hauptstädten nur noch auf technischer Ebene empfangen  

""the governments of the fourteen Member States will not promote or accept any 
official bilateral contacts at political level with an Austrian government integrating the FPÖ; there 
will be no support for Austrian candidates seeking positions in international organizations; 
Austrian Ambassadors in EU capitals will only be received at a technical level.""

They then send in a ""Rat there Weisen"" of 3 high ranking (former) politicians to asses the situation and write a report about Austria. The sanctions were lifted somewhere in 2000. This was generally received as a insult and humiliation.

But the effects of the sanctions where pretty significant (for Austria), they destroyed the support for the EU in Austria and pushed the ÖVP significantly because they managed to make it look like they stood up to the (now universally seen as bad) EU. 

In 2002 he initiated a re-election, the FPÖ lost a lot of votes (mainly because of intern struggles),  and then formed again the ÖVP-FPÖ coalition but now with a stronger ÖVP (also this time the strongest party in Austria).

About the Pentapartito and PCI, I state again that you are making a big mess: PCI never had the chance to govern Italy. 
Then it splitted into PDS, led by Achille Occhetto who lost against Berlusconi. And that was really bad.

Again: unfortunately for me: I *lived* this history. Wikipedia is only to state that what I'm saying are not my opinions, but historical facts. 

And a fact is that DC led Italy out from the disaster of WWII. Then - as always - power attracts corruption and the last DC was corrupted, not as much as PSI, but still corrupted. Having said this, DC was an important positive force in Italy, for several years.

About the job act, fear no doubt: I'm a freelancer, I'm living on my very skin what does it mean not having ""job rights"" (and being called - we freelancers - by corrupted sindacalists: ""tax evaders"").
Also I'm living everyday face-to-face with employees whose main task is to get to end-of-day working as little as possible, so I have some strong opinions about ""job rights"", or about corrupted trade unionists that foment troubles for ""power"" reasons, instead of trying to solve those very problems.

Romanians prefer to ignore the problems on the long term and concentrate on short term advantages and our politicians know this and they are concentrating an a false dichotomy, "" either we are with UE or we will fall under Russia again"" - and most of my countrymen would better sell themselves into slavery than fall under Russsia again.

This same bulk of the population never thinks and never has thought. It just takes whatever is given to them with a little bit of resistance and once X amount of time has passed they again evolve into the new mainstream. The true thinkers are the ones that push on even when they are ridiculed and laughed at.

I stand corrected.

And to answer your general question: why would anyone think that tobacco needs even stricter regulation? Why take away Menthol and Flavors from smokers, who by now really know what they're doing to themselves? This is no longer about protecting people from becoming addicts, this is just punishing people for being addicts.

But as we have established. It wasn't Amelia's fault. So my reluctant vote for the Pirates is now much less reluctant.

Thanks!

Two custom's unions went toe to toe...and then the EU wonders why Putin suddenly began making their own moves.  Net result?  Ukraine got split, people were killed, and relations soured.

Well played EU.  Well played.

&gt;I see plenty of public sector waste here the cohesion fund is a relatively small budget and your overstating the waste, it's moot anyway because those aren't the main driver.

I'm not overstating it.  I'm citing EU officials saying it is a dog's dinner.

&gt;Try another angle where is eastern Europe with out the EU.

Making non-protectionist trade deals and with more sovereignty, but that's a matter for eastern Europe.  This is about the UK.

&gt;The UK could get trade deals no sane person says other wise, independent Scotland could, even Somalia has trade deals, the quantity is not important it's the terms.

That's what the WTO is there for, and the UK would have it's own input at the WTO again rather than having to go through a less representative EU.

The trade deals that are being brokered tend to be reducing trade tariffs gradually.  The trade deals the EU is trying to do on our behalf are deliberately poisoning the meat with the likes of ACTA or ISDS.  

Added to that the UK on its own could be a lot more tailored, a lot more open, and doesn't have to go through a 28 bloc of vetoes if it wants to renegotiate later on.

&gt;The SNP and plaid cymru voters clearly disagree with you that the UK is easier to fix, it depends ironically on what your interests inside the UK are.

And the SNP is getting its referendum.  If it stays in the UK then it will just have to argue its case as a minority; if it leaves then it is no longer relevant.  Plaid is just another minority party - but they're more than welcome to make their own case in an UK exit referendum.

&gt;Standards are the same, we can all make up our own just fine, but it rapidly becomes a cluster fuck as much of the world shows, you either have to accept someone els's, raise the cost of doing business in your country or race to the bottom.

I'm pretty sure we'd be able to do it at a smidgen of the EU, because at the moment we're essentially paying for two parliaments and two executives.  The EU is raising the cost of business in the UK.  That's the whole point.

Now if the rEU wants as a 27bloc to write up a load of neat regulation for 27 countries, pay for it, and provide is with a target to meet if we want to trade with it then great.  We'll lower our business costs, taxation and energy and flog them stuff that meets their regulations.  If they want to sell us stuff we either voluntarily choose to accept their standards or they have to meet ours.  Just as we do with our largest single nation trading partner, the US.  Just like we do when we trade with Japan, or wherever...

No biggy.

&gt;EU also doesn't stop us from exceeding the standards just stops a race to the bottom.

Outside the EU we could do that for ourselves too.       

The problem with the EU is the sheer volume of regulations and directives they pump out, and we can take SMEs that don't trade with the EU out from under this extra burden.   Can't do that from within the EU.

&gt;I suppose to your original question, it's not for the most part we can't have stuff outside it's the terms on which we get it

We're good.  We've already got an EFTA agreement outside the EU, we have been offered AA status.  We've the 6th largest GDP in the world and the world is much bigger than the EU.  We'll be just fine.

&gt;beyond strengthening the west as a whole which you dont seem interested in.

I'm interested in strengthening the UK, and if we can mutually help the West, East, South and North and make more friends, then great.

The ISO standards are just one example of standards that don't need any political or national involvement.

By limiting free movement to only people who already have a job or to people that have something extra to give say knowledge in a specific area, specialists, entrepreneurs etc. allows the market to attract the people it need without the people it doesn't need.

&gt; 
&gt; **EU rules – the facts**
&gt; 
&gt; First, it is important to note that the EU rules have all been agreed by all Member States, including the UK.
&gt; 
&gt; **Rules on free movement**
&gt; 
&gt; EU citizens have a right to stay in the UK, or any other Member State that is not their own, for up to three months with a valid passport or identity card. But to stay for longer, they need to be:
&gt; 
&gt;* in employment; or
&gt; 
&gt; * continue to seek employment and have a genuine chance of being engaged; or
&gt; * to be able to show that they have sufficient resources not to be a burden on public funds and sickness insurance.
&gt; 
&gt; In other words, as UK Immigration Minister Mark Harper recently put it in the Daily Mail: [“European nationals do not have unrestricted access to the UK. They must be exercising their treaty rights. This means they must be working, studying or self-sufficient.”](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2269838/Migrants-medical-insurance-wont-NHS-care-Ministers-tough-stance-new-influx-East.html)
&gt; 
&gt; Individuals can also be excluded or expelled on the grounds of public policy or in the event of abuse or fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; The full and exact legal provisions are to be found in [this EU law adopted by the European Parliament and by national Ministers in 2004.](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2004L0038:20110616:EN:PDF)
&gt; 
&gt; **Rules on rights to claim benefits**
&gt; 
&gt; To get a full picture of how the EU rules work, we need to distinguish between two categories of benefits:
&gt; 
&gt; * Social assistance benefits – such as Income Support or Housing Benefits– are typically means tested and given to people in need. These benefits are not financed by contributions paid by the individuals, but through general taxation.

&gt;  EU citizens who are workers or self-employed in the UK (and their family members) are eligible for social assistance benefits without any conditions. That is only fair as they contribute, like all other UK workers, through their taxes to the public funds from which the benefits are financed.
&gt; 
&gt;  Conversely, EU citizens who are not employed should not be eligible for these benefits as EU law requires them to have resources higher than the income threshold under which the benefits are granted.
&gt; 
&gt;* Social security benefits are granted to provide cover against the classical social security risks – sickness, maternity and paternity, accidents at work and occupational diseases, old-age and invalidity, unemployment and having to assume financial responsibility for a family. Depending on the social security system of the Member State in question, they may be financed out of contributions (in the UK for example State Pension and contribution-based Jobseeker’s Allowance) or out of general taxation (in the UK for example healthcare in the NHS)
&gt; 
&gt;  Again, EU citizens who are workers or self-employed persons in the UK (and their direct family members) are entitled to social security benefits on the same terms as UK citizens, provided that they meet certain conditions established by national law, such as for example reaching the retirement age for an old-age pension or having made sufficient contributions for an unemployment benefit.
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, EU law says that before EU citizens not active in the labour market become eligible for social security benefits they have to pass a strict “habitual residence test” proving that they have a genuine link with the UK.
&gt; 
&gt; This test has been agreed by all Member States, including the UK, [under this EU Regulation.](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:284:0001:0042:EN:PDF)
&gt; 
&gt; In practice, a significant number of those who pass the habitual residence test have worked and paid taxes in the UK for a certain period or are living in the UK as a direct family member of someone working.
&gt; 
&gt; (The full criteria EU Member States should apply under the habitual residence test include the duration and continuity of the person’s presence in the Member State concerned; the nature of any activity pursued, including its stability or whether it is habitually pursued and the duration of any work contract, the exercise of any non-remunerated activity; the person’s family status and family ties; in the case of students, the source of their income; the person’s housing situation and its permanence; and in which country the person pays tax.)
&gt; 
&gt; These criteria for assessing habitual residence are strict and thus ensure that only those persons who have genuinely moved their centre of interest to a Member State are considered habitually resident there. This is a powerful tool for the UK and other Member States to make sure that social security benefits are only granted to those who are entitled to receive them.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, in order to receive those social security benefits that are directly linked to a certain length or value of contribution, EU migrants must also meet those criteria as well as the habitual residence test.
&gt; 
&gt; So reports that the European Commission is insisting that the UK should provide benefits for non-active EU migrants “from day one” are quite simply untrue.
&gt; 
&gt; What is true is that the Commission, as it is legally obliged to do under EU treaties and rules to which the UK has signed up, has formally asked the UK to cease applying an additional “right to reside” test specific to the UK and which goes beyond the habitual residence test agreed by all Member States.
&gt; 
&gt; In many cases EU nationals living in the UK are indeed receiving the social security benefits to which they are entitled. But applying this additional right to reside test is depriving some other EU nationals living in the UK, in full compliance with EU rules and within the strict limits set by those rules, of social security benefits to which they are entitled.
&gt; 
&gt; In many cases, these EU nationals have worked and paid their tax and social security contributions in the UK, yet are still being refused benefits.
&gt; 
&gt; The fact that the UK continues to apply this test means that it is applying different criteria to EU nationals in the UK than those being applied to UK nationals resident elsewhere in the EU (of which there are up to two million according to some estimates).
&gt; 
&gt; **Rights to National Health Service (NHS) treatment**
&gt; 
&gt; First, EU law certainly does not make the UK a safe haven for EU citizens who would like to come to get healthcare at the expense of UK taxpayers.
&gt; 
&gt; Those who come for short periods, for example on holiday, can receive basic and emergency care, by using the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC – formerly known as an E111).
&gt; 
&gt; However, under the EHIC system, that care is ultimately paid for by their own Member State of residence. Such visitors are in general not entitled to non-urgent treatment for existing medical conditions and neither are they entitled to come to the UK specifically to obtain NHS treatment.
&gt; 
&gt; EU law on the coordination of social security systems provides that those EU citizens – and only those – who can show that they are either employed or self-employed in the UK or non-active but habitually resident in the UK (see above for the criteria) are fully entitled to treatment by the NHS on the same terms as resident UK citizens.
&gt; 
&gt; UK law is in line with this principle and does allow EU citizens who are genuinely resident in the UK to have full access to NHS treatment.
&gt; 
&gt; UK citizens in other Member States have access to state funded healthcare systems there on the same basis.
&gt; 
&gt; But the UK does not recognise entitlement to NHS treatment as comprehensive sickness insurance cover within the meaning of EU law on free movement of EU citizens. It is on that issue that the Commission launched “infringement proceedings” (legal action) in 2011 against the UK.
&gt; 
&gt; In the Commission’s view, EU law requires that in assessing whether a non-active EU citizen should be entitled to remain in the UK under the free movement rules, the UK authorities must consider NHS cover – IF the person qualifies for it – as sufficient sickness insurance, without requiring them to obtain private insurance. It is worth emphasising again that the mere fact of being present in the UK is NOT enough to ensure qualification for NHS cover.
&gt; 
&gt; EU rules do not prescribe to EU countries how they should set up their national health-care systems. They can shape those systems as they see fit and the only obligation is that they cannot discriminate against EU citizens from other EU countries.
&gt; 
&gt; Like a number of other Member States (Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Sweden, Finland), the UK has decided to set up a scheme which does not link entitlements to individual contributions.

true,Rarehero,EURO,European Union,"&gt; You don't have to be in the EU to trade with it, or to even have a free trade deal with it.   
&gt; 
&gt; Former Secretary of State for Trade under Gordon Brown, and former secretary-general of CBI has even said candidly that if the UK were to decide to leave they could probably have trade deals with Europe in 24 hours if they wanted.

Sure, you could have a free trade agreement with the EU, but under less favorable conditions. The EU would shape the agreements, not the UK. 


&gt;We're already a signed member of EFTA outside our EU signatory.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but hasn't the UK left the EFTA to join the EEC in 1973? Today the EFTA is quite irrelevant with Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein as its only members.


&gt;Most of the shots have already been called, and they're tied by the WTO competition rules to not act persecutory.

I was not talking about competition rules but about standards concerning goods and commodities. 


&gt;Nothing against Switzerland but we could have a UK model, not a Swiss model.

What makes you think that the reality would much different for the UK? You don't have that much to offer that 450 Million EU-citizens would care much about what you want. 



&gt;We have no say in US, Chinese, Indian, South Korean, Australian, Canadian,...,..., regulations either.

But you could be part of a bloc that dictates regulations instead of being a single economy that is omitted by the power blocs.



&gt;You want us to meet EU decided regulations when we trade with you? Fine. The 5% of UK business that currently trades with the EU will know they'll have to meet EU regs when dealing with the EU.

Huh? [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2050.html#uk](Most of your exports go into the EU), and you want to give up the ability the negotiate the standards and regulations your industries have to comply in order to do business inside the EU.


&gt;We'll take the access without the freedom of movement for people, thanks.

Why should the EU agree to that?


&gt;We'll just offer work visas and advertise jobs, and if Europeans want to come they can apply.

Why should the Europeans want to come if it's such a hassle to get a foot on the British Isles and adopt to British regulations? They won't, and the British government will react to that and search for an agreement with the EU that makes the UK more attractive to qualified European employees. Which again will happen under the conditions set by the EU. And why should the EU be interested in an agreement with the UK that makes it easy and attractive for EU-citizens to leave the EU for a non-EU country? Unless of course you participate in Schengen and guarantee free movement of labor between the UK and the EU (no way that such an agreement would be one-sided in favor of the UK).


&gt;In fact, we could actually make it easier for Commonwealth and anglophone countries if we didn't have uncontrolled immigration with half a billion EU citizens.

Instead of having uncontrolled immigration with half a billion EU citizens, you would prefer uncontrolled immigration from 2.1 billion Commenwealth countries of which most are coming from second or third world countries? Yep, sounds like the perfect alternative to the lazy, uneducated Southern Europeans.


&gt;Scaremongering.

Like the outrage over the alleged mass-immigration? Like the outrage over the ""regulation spleen"" of the EU?


&gt;Aaaand if it is a case of dealing in a bloc then we can have a bigger one in the Commonwealth

With Black Africa, holiday resorts in the Pacific or with countries that already tied with other blocs. Canada trades almost exclusively with the USA, Australia trades mainly 
with the USA, Japan, Singapore and South Korea, India trades mainly with the USA, the Arabian Emirates and China. Why should Canada form a bloc with India? They will rather deepen their relations with the USA. India will seeker closer ties with the Arabian peninsula and China, Australia might move closer to Oceania and South-East Asia. Why should they be interested in a Commonwealth-bloc? Why should they come when the UK calls? The only thing the UK has to offer to the Commenwealth is a door to Europe. 


&gt;Same with the rest of the wider world outside the EU.

Who cares about China when most of your exports go into the EU?


&gt;If they want to trade with the US or China, or vice versa, then we'll keep with their regs and they with ours.

The UK won't become more attractive for foreign companies and investments if you install your own set of unique regulations and give up your attractive position inside the EU. Many companies will move their headquarters and investments to the EU, and when companies have to decide between adapting their products for the EU-market with 450 Million people or the UK-market with 60 Million people, they will omit the UK-market. In the end British government will figure that it might be a good idea to adopt to EU regulations and guarantees, which again won't come without liabilities under the terms of the EU.

There's a reason why Switzerland has negotiated hundreds of agreements with the EU over the years which have tied Switzerland with the EU, and that reason is not that the Swiss are stupid.


&gt;We'll just be more competitive, cheaper, and more flexible 

Until you realize that the blocs simply omit you.


&gt;I'm just saying we personally can get all the good stuff without going into a political union or even federalism;

I think you greatly underestimate the necessities of a free trade zone and economic bloc. It's not done with lifting duties and granting visa-free entry.


&gt;There's the ECJ. Even the EFTA courts are far preferable to the ECJ. At least you're guaranteed a former UK judge who knows about UK law when presiding over a UK matter (and they get more scope for interpretation).

That's not a reason to leave the EU. It's a reason to request adjustments and reforms. 


&gt;EU's doing a good case of paving the way for extremists already it would seem.

An overwhelming majority of people has voted for a EU-friendly course. We have to take the shift to the right seriously, but it's not like that we have lost the EU to the right-wing. The conservatives and social-democrats have won, Juncker will become president of the commission. The right-wing populists will move closer to the center-right or they will be gone. The right-wing extremists will do some noise, never find common agenda and eventually be gone when the people notice that they don't have anything to say.

He did become premier with a vote, whoever says otherwise still can't get the fact that we vote for the party, not for the premier. Also, some of those things were required to make the government work, what was the point of the *reimpasto* if the next PM would have resigned 2 weeks later? I'm a little bit Machiavellian here. Nobody in the party likes those guys, but it had to be done. 

As for the ""1 reform a month"" thing, seriously, did you believe that in the first place? He's a politician, he says things like this for a living. Everyone in the world does that, yet only Italian politicians are patological liars. He didn't change a Constitution that took years to make in 3 months, what a failure, am I right?

Also, PD is by far the less yesman-y party Italy has, with all the different internal divisions. You could say that about M5S or FI, where one gets thrown out if he says something that goes against their leader, but most definitely not about PD.
If they would have lost the elections, people were ready to face each other and start once again from the beginning, no matter what *primarie* said back in Dec.
