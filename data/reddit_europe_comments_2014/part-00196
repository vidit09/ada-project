UKIP are a fringe party by every method of measurement. Yes, they're often in the press, but that is because of the sheer amount of racists and bigots they take on, and news stories about xenophobia are perfect selling material to a shocked British public. Yes, they seemed to win big because they won 27% of the vote in the recent EU elections, but this is a flawed sample. Most people don't give a hoot about the EU - to the point where only 34% of the population bothered to vote. To put it in perspective, only 7% of the UK population voted for UKIP.

Every poll ever conducted says that the UK would vote for EU reform or stay in the EU as it is before leaving, and yet here on /r/europe it would seem that Britain exiting the EU is a foregone conclusion.

Non saprei. Sicuramente gli agnostici (o i razionalisti, o chi per loro) manifestano una sorta di superiorità verso i credenti (io per primo), un po' come gli intellettuali di sinistra verso i conservatori. 

D'altro canto però credo che sia innegabile che la chiusura mentale derivante dall'ignoranza sia una grossa componente del successo delle religioni. I culti tendono ad innestare un approccio ""deontologico"" nei fedeli, limitando di fatto la possibilità di un dialogo. Se mia nonna crede che l'aborto sia un male perché la vita è sacra perché l'ha detto Gesù il figlio di Dio, non c'è nulla che io possa dirle di ""utilitaristico"" per farle cambiare idea.

This is true for every single western nation though. It's systemic.

Can't this Commissioner now get a regular job and not be corrupt? We've talked about this before, but personally I am astonished by the argument that the risk of corruption is a significant consideration when it comes to deciding the pay and benefits of public officials at the EU level. 

This just isn't part of the argument in the UK and the idea that we might need to pay former commissioners huge sums just to stop them being corrupt fills me with anger. 

However much we might dislike Cameron, surely he was right in the last EU budget negotiations [to specifically campaign against the monumental amounts of money that many EU officials get paid](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9699264/EU-summit-budget-talks-collapse-as-David-Cameron-says-non-to-Brussels.html)? Why do so few other countries seem care about this? 

The fact that the UK finds it extraordinariy difficult to get allies and win arguments even in something like this, at a time that there have been huge cuts in the pay of public officials across the EU at national level, makes me think that the UK can never really win any substantial arguments going forwards.

&gt; Next Commission should know very well how people feel about this, and act accordingly.

How do people feel about this? I am angry and you are angry and ten other people on r/europe are angry. But is there any real palpable public outcry, in the way that there was a few years ago at the MPs expenses scandal in Westminster? And if there is no widespread public anger, why not?

Sure, ""emergency"" legislation to ""keep the country safe.""

So which is it? Do you want to ""keep the country safe"" with ""emergency legislation"" or to prevent companies from destroying information when fearing legal challenges?

Classic. ""Don't worry! The law has good parts!""

Well I'm alright with indirect democracy, you elect people to make decisions for you and quite frankly I prefer the E.Us track record when it comes to workers rights/privacy over what Cameron would do. you could always move to Switzerland, they have direct democracy there.

Now that you know the scheme only works for banks with low interest rates like I said on the previous sentence, you might understand why I say BES didn't borrow money from the Portuguese state. It would achieve nothing for them. That is, it wouldn't achieve anything until now that they are cornered with no way to pay their debts except to borrow money. At this point, getting in bigger debt is probably their only way out, temporarily. It seems to be the trend in Portugal these days.

true,elphieLil84,EURO,European Union,"&gt; Can't this Commissioner now get a regular job and not be corrupt? We've talked about this before, but personally I am astonished by the argument that the risk of corruption is a significant consideration when it comes to deciding the pay and benefits of public officials at the EU level. 

It's into consideration everywhere, even in UK for national politician. Corruption of public official is a human fact, not a specifically cultural one. Certainly, the intensity varies, but it's always there.

But I have to say that Cameron campaigned in a silly way. If you want results, you first target the big jobs, and you leave the average fonctionnaire as last. Targeting everybody in the same way made it look like a vague populistic allegation instead of a serious matter of public policy.

As for the rest you said, Greens and GUE have campaigned against big pays for Commissioners since the start.

What amuses me is the fact that you believe this is a specific EU institutions matter. Politicians are overpaid everywhere, as we know quite well in Italy. It's not because of EU culture as such that they're paid stupid amounts, it's because in most countries, this is the norm.

Now, it needs to be changed, and citizens should make themselves heard on that.

You are surprised there is no great outcry. The sad reality is that we care about EU issues, but most people in most countries have been accurately trained not to. Obscurantist media and national governments have made the EU a grey matter, not much the EU itself.

The EU is like any other legislator: it should make news for its impact.

And yet, crap loads of media ignore the big changes made everyday in citizens' life brought by EU legislation. When they give attention, it's generally a pile of misinformed click-bait-y shite.

There is no conspiracy though. Just a terrible amount of ignorance. media (and politicians)don't know square shit about the EU, and they underestimate its impact. Thus, they under-report it.

Thus people cannot get involved in campaign to change it, unless some groups (like the environmental ones), manage to inform at least on an issue and to get people to campaign for that.",0,1404987303,null,0,false,0,citdyut,t3_2a8d54,t1_citdyut,t1_citdpm6,null,1434640837,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Tell that to UKIP. They started a few years ago as a single issue party and just won a national election. Why can't you do the same?

&gt; When I say something has got to give, I mean that the system of a democratic dictatorship - one where the ruling party take all governmental positions, must be restructured into something more representative of the electorate.

This argument has some merits, but personally I would not want your system. The legislature is already (theoretically) representative of the electorate, why should the excutive also be representative? Shouldn't there be people with a constitutional function of scrutinising the executive?

etc. etc. etc. 

Even within the EU, there are benefits to having dual citizenship. If you're a nordic citizen, you don't need to prove your language proficiency when studying anywhere in Scandinavia. The same thing goes for Germany. Having a German citizenship means that they consider you to be fluent in German. France, the UK, the Netherlands and Denmark all have large possessions overseas, that you can access with their respective citizenships. 

&gt;It simply doesn't deprive me of the benefits everyone else has, like being able to return to the place of their childhood and not be a stranger there.

I have one citizenship, and I still don't have that benefit. It's not some universal right that everyone has. 

It bothers me that you complain about all of the above mentioned additional benefits, as if it's some sort of burden that you have to carry. You don't have to hold dual citizenship. You can quickly revoke either of them, if it bothers you so much.

Bulgarian *citizens* being discriminated in the UK -- racism. Saying something bad about a certain religion -- racism.

true,PsychoPosh,IDF,Ile-de-France,"Étudiant psycho ici. En réalité psychiatre et psychologue sont très différents. Outre la prescription, le psychiatre a aussi l'habilitation à décider d'une hospitalisation. Au delà de ça, les différences apparaissent dans leurs formations propres. Là où je travaillais il y avait une différence ÉNORME entre les psychiatres de plus de 50 ans et les autres. Les premiers passaient souvent plus de 45 min avec leurs patients, à échanger sur de multiples aspects de leur vie et de leur souffrance subjective, tandis que les seconds agissaient en tant que médecins ""diagnostic&gt;prescription&gt;suivant"". Je caricature un peu mais vraiment pas tant que ça.

Et puis quels que soient les médecins, à travailler avec eux on se rend compte bien souvent (surtout en psychiatrie) que y'a énormément d'aspects qui consistent à du bricolage, surtout pour les médicaments, où même si les modes d'actions sont connus, les différences inter individuelles sont énormes, et donc il y a souvent des changements au fur et à mesure du temps.


Pour ce qui est des psychologues : il y a deux grandes familles (y'en a plus mais on va pas faire un post de 900 lignes). Ceux d'inspiration cognitive, et ceux d'inspiration analytique.

Les cognitivistes font ce qu'on appelle des thérapies brèves : le patient arrive avec un problème, ou un symptôme, et le but est de le résoudre en X séances, généralement moins de 20. Une phobie, de l'anxiété, de la gestion d'hallucinations, de l'auto dépréciation, etc. Ça marche très bien pour certaines personnes, pas pour toutes. L'avantage, c'est la rentabilité, parce que c'est rapide, chiffrable, mesurable, quand c'est efficace ou que ça ne l'est pas. Le principal reproche que leur adresse les analystes c'est que selon eux ce type de thérapies ""met sous le tapis"" les problèmes sans les résoudre, et qu'ils seront amenés à revenir sous une autre forme. Là encore c'est parfois vrai, mais pas toujours.


Les analystes : alors là il ne faut pas se méprendre, tout les analystes ne font pas la ""cure type"" qui renvoie à ce que tout le monde imagine, le divan, 20 ans de suivi, un analyste muet, etc. Ce genre de pratique existe surtout en libéral, et s'adresse à des gens relativement ""sains"" (et friqués). En fait l'analyste se sert du corpus de pensée analytique comme un outil de compréhension du psychisme humain. Sans rentrer dans des interprétations fantasques, le fait de pouvoir mettre des mots et des termes sur des mouvements propres au comportement ou à la pensée humaine permettent d'élaborer une construction, certes subjective, mais qui permet de s'entendre soi même d'une manière toute particulière. On dit de ces psychos qu'ils bossent avec un référentiel analytique, et qu'ils dont des thérapies d'inspiration analytique. On leur reproche le manque de rentabilité dans le temps, et évidemment toutes les critiques relatives à Freud.

 Mais sans rentrer dans le débat, s'arrêter à la psychanalyse chez Freud, c'est comme s'arrêter à une critique des mathématiques en s'arrêtant à Euclide (la comparaison avec une science dure est volontairement provocatrice). Y'a eu énormément de travaux en un siècle, et y'a énormément de choses qui ne sont plus du tout d'actualité, mais bon, je me fais pas d'illusion, je sais qu'ici la plupart d'entre vous sont contre le principe du fait de l'absence de bases scientifiques vérifiables et reproductibles. Oui Freud était un cocaïnomane, obsédé par son image et sa postérité.


Quelqu'un a souligné l'existence des BAPU, c'est une très bonne idée, c'est pas cher, et y'en a partout.

Dernière chose pour conclure : quel que soit le référentiel de pensée du thérapeute, **ce qui est le plus important dans tout les cas, c'est l'alliance thérapeutique, soit la relation entre le professionnel et le patient, et l'investissement (personnel) de celui ci dans la volonté de changement.**

Well scratch the itches of everyone else then? Perhaps you think that a certain sector of the UK electorate are bigots: why not try and get the votes of everyone else?

&gt; Because there's an enormous difference between what the government says and what the government does. It limits the reach of the smaller parties that you mentioned earlier, which is precisely why I labelled them as largely useless.

Governments change though and different governments have different policies in many areas. Also, non-governmental parties, just by taking votes from governmental parties have influence, just by forcing the governmental parties to change their positions. 

&gt;  I just dislike that Labour and the Conservatives spend more time undoing one another's work and getting nothing done in a situation more akin to a game of tennis than a democracy.

But presumably you sometimes want things to get undone if they were not the right thing? And some things don't get undone, they become part of the political consensus (e.g. privatisations, minimum wage, indpendent bank of England, devolution...) In my mind, this is exactly what democracy is for: different parties with different policy positions, sometimes undoing each others work and sometimes following it.

""Narrr I'll wait it out here, give it 5 or so years and we'll be out of the Eu anyway, so not much to worry about""

You don't seem to realise how fucked up our position would be outside of the E.U do you? We would no longer get a say in how laws are made within our biggest (50% of our trade) trading partners (the EU) while if we want a free trade agreement we would still have to follow any rules those countries within the EU make without any chance of opposing them or veteoing them. Then theirs the fact that so many companies place their HQ in the U.K because were in biggest free trade zone in the world. Then there's the E.U funds that actually get invested in the the U.K (shocking I know, we do actually get something for our money) this along with things such as protecting our privacy with things like the net neutrality act and stopping any government turning us into America with working hours and holidays (EU working time directive). Then there's the ability to travel freely to other countries within the E.U and work there. We can also get trade deals with other countries such as the U.S without being screwed up the arse on the conditions because instead of a 63 million nation bargaining with a 330 million nation it's the biggest trade block in the world meaning we actually get fair and equal terms.

Lets take away all of that and leave the E.U... plenty to worry about.

""You mean the strength of indirect democracy is bills that benefit the pockets of rich arseholes can slip right through the net without anyone knowing. Also, who doesn't have time to look over a bill? It takes what, 20minutes to get the meat of the bill and think about where you stand on it. No time my arse.""

Yeah you seem to under the impression newspapers don't hold a massive amount of sway over peoples opinions. Direct democracy works well when your not being influenced constantly and fed bullshit by the news. (Daily Mail being a prime example) Hell if we had direct democracy I would bet we would bring back to the death penalty and use it against pedophiles while murdering them in the most brutal way possible.

""Too bad nobody in the world thinks a like on every single matter. What's to stop people in parliament from voting for something purely for personal or financial gain, that completely goes against what they believed? That pretty much sounds like Eu politics.""

Hence why we have free press, as much bullshit as they print they is investigative journalism into what MPs do, BBC recently got a few MPs accepted bribes to vote a certain way (British MP's not EU).

Having said that, the ""benefits"" you are listing mostly apply to someone who moved within Germany, too. 

* They can own land in their home state.
* They can vote there when they reside there. If there is a problem about double voting, I could get behind an agreement to make sure no one is voting in two places.
* They can't move to more countries because their former and current home have the same visa conditions, in my case the old country is far away from having as much visa-free travel as Germany, so...:
* The free travel depends on the nations in question, in my case it wouldn't apply.
* They can live in their former and current home states.
* They have access to both labour markets.
* Truth be told, as much as love Germany, I think in my case the other country would perhaps give a bigger shit about me than Germany. I guess that *could* count as a benefit. Although I do try not to get in trouble abroad, so, meh.
* I'm not sure how the military service is a benefit.
* Someone moving inside Germany can also benefit from the health care or education systems in their former and current home. Don't like Bavarian schools or doctors? Go back to Hesse or wherever.

As you see, most alleged benefits are things that people who didn't move across a border simply take for granted.

true,aldhelm,null,null,"&gt;Not really, Ukraine is one of the poorest European countries, with GDP per capita barely higher than that of Syria. Defense spending has been minimal for 23 years of independence and due to the same period of peace not a lot of experienced troops exist.

Ukraine manufactures a lot of these weapons. Unlike Syria they were lucky enough to reap a lot of the rewards of the USSR. Syria is a consumer of military hardware. Ukraine has just been sitting on it's ass selling of old stock to anybody who is willing to buy it without even modernising it's industry. You also don't need to be at war to have a skilled military. In fact that is a retarded way of thinking. Wait tills war to start getting skilled troops? Yeah if you want to lose.

&gt;That's a false statement -- there were multiple (June 3rd, May 12th, April 24th, etc) attack attempts which resulted in losses of people and equipment. 

If you look at the casualty figures given out then you'll see that this military isn't serious about offensives. A country like Syria lost 300 men in just one battle to open supply lines to Aleppo. Either these guys aren't serious or they're cowards. They spend most of their time attacking from a distance. They couldn't even stop the the majority of separatists from breaking out.


&gt;Take a look at the map and tell me if it's easier to flee to Kharkov or Rostov. And then provide me with a source for your claim.

To get to these places you have to go through the frontline and checkpoints. If your pro-Russian why the hell would you go to Ukrainian held territory?

&gt;How is airpower helpful in taking a densely populated city? Unless we're talking about leveling the city to the ground, airpower is rarely useful in urban environment.

That is a stupid statement. Air power is useful in Urban battles for suppressing the enemy, pinning them down and destroying places they are gathered. Ukraine used airpower effectively in the Donetsk airport when they killed more than a hundred separatists. Go and talk to a single NATO soldier who has served in Afghanistan. Airpower is critical and it's the the single most important factor in saving the lives of many soldiers in Afghanistan. The British forces in Helmand would have been overran and massacred countless times if it wasn't for airpower.

&gt;What's a pre-2011 Ukraine and why would anyone have to go back to it? And what gives you the power to speak for all locals?

I meant pre 2014. The Ukraine where people where happy to be together. Where people in the East and West would put up with each other. Right now the ones in the West are taking the country in a direction others don't want to and those people aren't going to put up with it. I don't need to speak up for the locals they are speaking for themselves. Go and look at what is coming from Kiev and Donetsk. The country is fractured. Go and watch Vice videos of Crimea. The vast majority of the locals were helping the Russians. Look at the defection rate. This war isn't being cooked up by Putin. It's Ukrainians who are in the driving seat.

&gt;Indeed. This has nothing to do with the topic on hand though. Don't forget that Ukraine is not even a candidate for EU membership.

The goal of Ukrainians who are in power is to join the EU and NATO. They aren't going to ever be allowed to join NATO now but the EU dream is still alive. The EU has been actively courting Ukraine for a long time. This crisis didn't just suddenly spring up. It's been simmering for a long time. That is why the EU countries took legally dubious actions. Either way I hope they don't join until they clean up their act.

&gt;WTF are you talking about? Which fantasy? Who ignores what?

The fantasy that ALL Ukrainians want to join the EU while Putin is masterminding all of this. You know what I mean.

&gt;Please elaborate. I'd like to know why ""Glory to Ukraine"" should be enough of a wake up call.

And what do I need to ""trust you"" about? That you're right? Well why don't you go ahead and prove those claims you made:

&gt;RS never tried to seceed they wanted all of Bosnia.

How do you know that? Do you have some intimate knowledge of Bosnian Serbs' leaders intentions that proves this? If so, produce the evidence, please.

I have read Mladić's diaries in its entirety, and nowhere does he mention the plan of conquering 100% of Bosnia's territory. In fact, you can sense his disagreement with Karadžić about Karadžić's pursue for 70+% of ""historically Serbian land"", when Mladić actually wanted less territory in order to defend it more adequately. Just google ""ratko mladic war diaries"" and read for yourself, I'm not making up any of this.

&gt; Even when you go back to 92' you hear Bosnian troops saying that they want Bosniaks and Serbs to live side by side...

And that proves... what exactly? There are also Bosnian troops shouting ""Allahu Ackbar"" and there are pictures of Bosnian fighters doing stuff like [**NSFW**] [this](http://i.imgur.com/5JiEA7D.jpg) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/sA6mDyG.jpg) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/RxrQ1do.jpg); does that make them all religious fanatics and jihadists and terrorists? The answer is: no. You can't just take one instance of something and say that's how everything is like. You have to take into account a representative sample of Bosnian fighters, interview them about whatever you want and then make a conclusion - your anecdotal evidence means nothing. You can only make generalizations about whatever you want it to mean (like I demonstrated with those pictures of severed heads of Serbian civilians) but that pretty much worthless.

Wie gut, dass es reddit gibt. Aber vor allem:

&gt; Das ist nicht nur ein zahlenmäßiges Ungleichgewicht, die Formulierungen zeichnen auch unterschiedliche Bilder

Von einem ""Ungleichgewicht"" zu sprechen ist und zu bemängeln, dass Israel nicht als Verteidiger dargestellt wird, ist für mich durchaus eine Beschwerde. Wenn man die tatsächlichen Zusammenhänge bitte gerne außen vor lassen würde, woran macht man dann fest, was ""fair"" ist? Das ist eine völlig sinnlose Fingerübung im Vakuum. Man könnte meinen Post auch analysieren, indem man Worte zählt (vor allem habe ich das Wort ""gierig"" im Zusammenhang mit Juden verwendet, da müssten doch gleich mal die Alarme losgehen, hah).

Israel sitzt immer noch auf im Krieg eroberten Land (dass es ein Verteidigungskrieg war, ändert nichts an der Illegalität dessen), und wenn man sich die Karten anguckt, die zeitliche Entwicklung, dann werden die besetzten Gebiete langsam aber sicher verschluckt. Da muss man schon sehr blind sein oder sich dumm stellen, um das nicht zu bemerken.

Mir ist zwar trotzdem klar, dass die sogenannte ""Arab Nation"" (damit meine ich nicht alle Araber, sondern die, die sich dazuzählen und meinen, das wäre superwichtig - von denen gibt es 'ne Menge) mit ihren ganzen Organisationen und Predigern die Palästinenser nur ausnutzen, um sie als Hebel gegen Israel zu verwenden. Wäre das nicht der Fall, dann wären militanter Widerstand gegen Israel schlicht Selbstverteidigung, und jede Zeitung, die das anders oder zweideutig darstellt, ein Arschloch. So wie es ist, ist es eben komplizierter, aber eben auch nicht soooo wahnsinnig komplex. Wie gesagt, wer wohin zieht und wo was besetzt, spielt eine Rolle. Und die Siedlungsprojekte gehen weiter, obwohl Israel damit mit nur einer F-16 ganz locker Schluss machen könnte, komplett, an einem Nachmittag.

Aber du hast Recht, ich habe bei ""rummaulen"" auch an anderes Zeug gedacht, dass mir auf Facebook oder sonstwo um die Ohren schwappt. Dieses Geflenne von der ach so ungerechten Behandlung ist schon ein roter Faden, und die Gegenseite ist da ja auch nicht besser, aber ganz unter uns: von denen erwarte ich auch nicht so viel, denn die behandeln sich gegenseitig ja auch nicht besser. Israel? Ganz andere Geschichte, und höhere Ansprüche. Judaismus ist im Kern zwar genauso blöde und chauvinistisch wie Christentum oder Islam (ich habe mich mit allen 3 mehr auseinandergesetzt, als mir lieb ist, ich WÜNSCHTE das wären Vorurteile, aber das sind bestenfalls Interpretationsirrtümer meinerseits), aber ein paar Vorfahren der Israelis haben ja wenigstens europäische Bildung genossen. Das sind nicht irgendwelche Hinterwäldler, bzw. haben sie keine Ausrede, wenn sie sich wie welche verhalten. (wer die Ironie an meiner Kritik von Chauvinismus und dieser Aussage findet, darf sie behalten)

Und überhaupt, Kritik von Israelis an Aktionen Israels scheint mir nicht *annähernd* so vernuschelt wie westliche... für Forderungen, für die man hier als Antisemit verschrien würde, haben die Organisationen mit mehr als einer handvoll Anhängern... dieses wehleidige Rumgepose in Deutschland oder Amerika ist für mich vor allem Bauernfängerei, in Israel selbst kommt man so billig und denkfaul nicht davon, zumindest nicht bei allen.

Berlusconi è un figlio ribelle di queste famiglie. Ne fa parte ma si oppone ai loro ordini, ha cercato di combattere il loro piano malefico di far impoverire l'Italia con tutte le sue forze ma non c'è riuscito. Se qualche politico non segue gli ordini, nel giro di un anno lo rovinano.

*L’immigration en Belgique a plus ou moins le même âge qu’en France, mais elle est plus qualifiée (…) plutôt intra-européenne », à 70 %*.

En France, 40% de l'immigration vient d'Afrique et [seulement 45% d'Europe](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_en_France#Origine_g.C3.A9ographique). Ce qui veut dire une immigration plus pauvre et peu éduquée, avec des cultures et des comportements tout à fait respectables mais différents.

Those can be avoided. I don't believe that a nice person can turn rapist all of a sudden out of the blue. Mostly it's a case of ""Sure my boyfriend hit me, but he's just so passionate and promised to be good!"" and that's a case of just ignoring the warning signs and not getting out of the relationship at the right time.

But the rape stats (at least in Northern-Europe) show that assault rapes (often gang-rapes and even mutilations) are committed by 3rd world immigrants. That's something that threatens all the young women, not just stupid ones who play with fire. This I don't like at all.

I'd support some kind of recognition of the constitutional core of the UK and a convention that referenda are needed to change it.

I'm sympathetic to PR, but not convinced that is necessarily leads to better outcomes. As mentioned, I expect electoral reform could well be an issue in the next parliament.

&gt; Well the suppression of the anti-EU voice is more relevant than whether somebody supports UKIP or not. Consensus has basically been used to deny anyone who wants out a voice in recent years. I'm pro-EU but I dislike the way this works.

This consensus has started to breakdown. If the EU membership refendum happens in 2017, it is likely that we won't see a consensus in Westminster or in the media or in business. One of the reasons for this breakdown is the rise in the UKIP vote - i.e. the democratic process.

2. More importantly, on April 8th 2014, the Court of Justice of the European Union declared this directive invalid.
[Full text of the judgment in English here](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d0f130de62690c70602145e99ab781dd2a917774.e34KaxiLc3eQc40LaxqMbN4OaNyQe0?text=&amp;docid=153045&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=395043) / [in other languages there](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/documents.jsf?num=C-293/12).


In other words: the 24 months storage *would* have been the maximum imposed by the EU, but the directive asking for data retention is anyway invalid. Member states are not forced to implement any data retention.

We expect corporations to pursue profits, but not at the cost of society as a whole (in terms of public health, the environment, etc.). If you think completely unregulated markets solve those problems I just mentioned, then you're living in a different reality. Deregulation if anything is what caused financial crises in the past, why don't you ask Alan Greenspan if the 'invisible hand' works.

Given that I haven't told you what my notion of ""free market"" is or the extent to which I think markets should be regulated, I find it odd that you are criticising this staw-man.

Some reading for you:

&gt; We know with certainty that former Defense Minister Mikael Odenberg lied when he said that the FRA would monitor the Swedes, and would not give the police access to the information. The plan from the U.S., the Swedish government was implementing in secret, was all the time that both the police and the U.S. would have free access to all information.

    continues to be placed in the Special 301 Initiative, and not be on
    the Watch List for 2009. We are aware of the differing

    of the six items identified in the Special 301 Initiative Action
    plan we communicated to the GOS last year; and

http://forum.prisonplanet.com/index.php?topic=227896.0

Sweden is given a check list to complete and is now cooperating... and thus not put on the watchlist.


Do you know why 'thepiratebay' founders were found guilty in Sweden? I don't, they did nothing illegal in Sweden, the hit was directly ordered from the US. and noncompliance would have meant trade sanctions, but that's fine, I should just accept some foreign power dictating law here because I'm on a high horse and the US. only stands for freedom right?
The threat made was ""blacklisting within the WTO"" made by the US. government to the Swedish government, in this case.


This is what has happened:

&gt; Among the treasure troves of recently released WikiLeaks cables, we find one whose significance has bypassed Swedish media. In short: every law proposal, every ordinance, and every governmental report hostile to the net, youth, and civil liberties here in Sweden in recent years have been commissioned by the US government and industry interests.

Why is the US., and US. companies dictating policy in Sweden, unless it's a puppet government?


&gt; Get off your high horse dude, it's pathetic.

Right back at you freedom cowboy.


You need to realise the US., Russia, China and other countries hell bent on global projection are the bane of **our**(rest of the worlds, especially smaller nations) existence, not because we are inherently corrupt, but because they're doing their absolute best to corrupt us and make us reliant, thus enabling them to pull further strings in the end.


The US. is the dominant leader in this practice since decades, its whole bloated military exists for this sole purpose, economic projection purely, for protecting resources and other economic entities it desires to keep, a kind of economic imperialism not unlike how the British empire began with trade and a large navy.


Time for you to swallow the reality pill like a man, realise the US. government practices are a fucking plague on the world.


The larger a country is, the more uncontrollable it can become, as is proven by the USA., an oligarchy with no semblance of of a conscience, yet continually it points at others for doing evil things.


How many civilians is the US. responsible for killing the recent years anyway, in the name of ~~freedom~~ mammon?

Idk what is taught in schools nowadays and if this is the proper way of structuring  a sentence but I wouldn't use the Plusquamperfekt/Perfekt like this.

If something happened before whatever it is you're doing now, I'd pair Präsens + Perfekt. I think it is stylistically better than using two auxiliary verbs in one sentence...

&gt; L'OCDE estime que les immigrants jouent un rôle décisif dans la croissance économique à long terme

Faux : 

Le rapport complet est [ici](http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/social-issues-migration-health/international-migration-outlook-2013_migr_outlook-2013-en#page7). L'OCDE préconise de diminuer largement les allocations familiales, chômage et retraite. Dans ces conditions, l'immigration est souhaitable et bénéfique. Dans ces conditions seulement.

&gt;le travail des immigrés ne « concurrencerait » qu’une fraction du salariat issu des anciennes vagues d’immigration

À nouveau faux. Cela a été prouvé [au Royaume-Uni](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/9004733/Immigation-does-keep-Britons-out-of-jobs-government-committee-admits.html), pour l'immigration hors-UE. Par contre, dès qu'on prend en compte l'immigration intra-UE, les chiffres changent.

C'est [la même chose en France](http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2012/06/15/les-descendants-d-immigres-plus-exposes-au-chomage-que-les-immigres_1719482_3224.html), il faut distinguer les immigrés hors-UE des autres dans les études.

&gt;Si la France optait pour une « immigration zéro », ce n’est pas 3 % du PIB supplémentaire qu’il faudrait trouver à l’horizon 2050 pour financer la protection sociale, mais 5 % du PIB

Comme déjà dit ailleurs, et confirmé par l'OCDE que tu cites pourtant, l'immigration a en France un impact négatif sur les recettes fiscales. S'en servir pour justifier un gain est donc absurde. Et encore une fois, on oublie de comptabiliser le coût en infrastructure et en intégration. Voir par exemple [cette étude au Royaume-Uni](http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/6869/1/MPRA_paper_6869.pdf).

Et c'est ce que rappelait Maurice Allais, le seul prix Nobel français d'économie :

*Les raisonnements économiques sur l'immigration sont ici généralement tout à fait superficiels . C'est un fait que dans les différents pays, le capital national reproductible est de l'ordre de quatre fois le revenu national. Il en résulte que lorsqu'un travailleur immigré supplémentaire arrive, il faudra finalement pour réaliser les infrastructures nécessaires (logements, hôpitaux, écoles, universités, infrastructures de toutes sortes, installations industrielles, etc....) une épargne supplémentaire égale à quatre fois le salaire annuel de ce travailleur. Si ce travailleur arrive avec une femme et trois enfants, l'épargne supplémentaire nécessaire représentera suivant les cas, dix à vingt fois le salaire annuel de ce travailleur, ce qui manifestement représente pour l'économie une charge très difficile à supporter*.

&gt;Enquête emploi à l’appui, Hervé Le Bras a montré que le taux d’activité entre des étrangers de 30 à 49 ans et des Français du même âge est sensiblement identique (90 % et 95 %)

Encore une fois, [distinguer UE et hors-UE](http://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/actualite-presse,42/breves,2137/etudes-recherches-statistiques-de,76/etudes-et-recherches,77/publications-dares,98/dares-analyses-dares-indicateurs,102/2012-077-emploi-et-chomage-des,15556.html) : 

*La participation des immigrés au marché du travail est comparable à celle des non immigrés pour les hommes. Elle est nettement plus faible, mais en progression, pour les femmes, en particulier pour celles originaires du Maghreb ou de Turquie. Le taux de chômage des immigrés nés hors de l’Union européenne est beaucoup plus élevé que celui des non immigrés. En 2011, il approche 23 % pour ceux originaires du Maghreb ou d’Afrique subsaharienne, contre 8,5 % pour les non immigrés.*

1. Les immigrés n’ont ""jamais été aussi nombreux"". En proportion, c'est à peu près stable. En nombre total c'est vrai : Selon les recensements partiels de l’INSEE, il y avait 3 771 000 étrangers en France en 2009 contre 3 338 000 en 1999, chiffre auquel il faut rajouter les naturalisations.

2. Les expulsions ""ont ralenti"" sous François Hollande : [Source](http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2013/10/08/01016-20131008ARTFIG00588-clandestins-la-police-francaise-relache-son-effort.php).     
Extrait : le rythme moyen d'éloignement des étrangers en situation irrégulière est passé de 100 personnes par jour l'an dernier à 60 par jour pour les huit premiers mois de l'année
3. Les immigrés ""servent le grand patronat"" ? Vrai : [Rapport du CAE](http://ingiagzennay.free.fr/Immigration-Gilles-Saint-Paul.pdf). L'argument est ridicule et sous entend que 90% des immigrés ne travaillent pas (comment vivent-ils ? doit-on s'étonner de leur pauvreté dans ce cas ?). Un petit rappel de [Francis Bouygues](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5dsEMl_F0Y)...
4. Les ""salaires baissent"" à cause des immigrés ? Vrai : [Rapport du CAE](http://ingiagzennay.free.fr/Immigration-Gilles-Saint-Paul.pdf). C'est prouvé partout pour les emplois non qualifiés. Dans ce cas, soit l'immigration empêche la hausse des salaires (l'immigré n'a pas le choix) soit elle augmente le chômage.
5. En augmentant le critère de ressources à 1,5 SMIC au lieu de 1 RSA, on divise le regroupement familial par 10 (-80 000 immigrés).     
Reste à appliquer le droit d'asile : aucun accord à renégocier, 70% des demandes sont à rejeter (30 000 renvois / an)

Enfin, je terminerai en dénonçant le mythe que l'immigration rapporte : l'immigration a, selon [le dernier rapport de l'OCDE](http://www.english.rfi.fr/africa/20130614-immigrants-contribute-more-they-cost-oecd-reports-finds), un impact fiscal négatif de 0,52% du PIB en France :

*France, Germany and Poland are exceptions, with immigrants costing an average of 1,450 euros a year between 2007 and 2009 compared to an OECD average gain of 3,280 euros.*

This isn't quite what I think happens. As the electorate, we have multiple decades of experience with our current political parties and the extent to which they abide by their manifesto commitments. We are able, in a democracy, to make voting decisions partly on the basis of our level of trust, which is partly a function of multiple years of experience. We are also able to create new political parties if we are not satisfied with the current ones.

&gt; After 1 or 2 parliaments cameron will be gone anyway (so little long term consequences of lying) so we will have to decide anew whether we believe the next set of leaders or not.

Manifestos are not just from the leader, they are from the entire party. While the leader might not have consequences once he is gone, the party does face consequences.

&gt; We need to be able to robustly trust things politicians say or the game theory solution to the problem of getting elected becomes to lie as much as possible.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt; Keeping equity between the different member states is also a policy.

No, it's an organizational principle. One that makes many policies pointless.

&gt;The UK has the same population as France, but half the land-mass. There is not space in the UK for the same number of farms as their is in France. This landmass is a factor stopping Brits get the same subsidies.

And? Subsidies are for farmers. Less farmers -&gt; less subsidies. I don't see the problem.

&gt;I am against tax-breaks designed specifically to support financial institutions. I believe that financial institutions should not be promoted at the expense of other kinds of business.

Then you have a lot of work to do within the UK.

&gt;I'm not sure if I quite agree with your analogy anyway. The job market for financial institutions in London is extremely flexible, with employees not just from all over Britain, but from all over the world. In this respect it represents a free market, with the costs of entry into that market being rather low. The job market for agriculture in France is much less of a free market, with far fewer entries from the rest of the world.

Assuming it's true, why is that relevant?

&gt;The UK is contributing to the common fund, but not taking from it. This means that there is more in the common fund. The UK isn't stopping other countries from taking from it or requiring special approval from them.

They were offered assistance, but refusing it. That doesn't make sense, until you consider that they're running a ""what has the EU ever done for us?"" campaign, and it would backfire politically if they gave their opponents such an easy way to disprove their assertion.

I don't pretend to have a complete solution but I think ridiculously strict probity requirements for MPs might help - for example be caught lying means instant dismissal from parliament never to return. Upheld conviction of any offence no matter how trivial - instant dismissal never to return. Failing to declare any possible conflict of interest whatsoever, or not recusing oneself from a vote or committee that stands to benefit one's interests - instant dismissal never to return. Any suspicious of wrong-doing - instant resignation for fear of bringing the house into disrepute.

But you generally agree with the UK's policy to nag for opt-outs and special negotiated arrangements for almost everything. That's inconsistent.

&gt;No, the argument is not ""feels good"". The argument is that a democracy works best in circumstances in which their is a shared political consciousness among a particular demographic. These take time to create and we are not there with Britain and the EU.

And there never will be as long as there are people who make a point of it to cultivate dislike against the EU. So the question remains: why?

&gt;Actually, the political class in the UK is much more proEU than the British people and this has been the case for generations. For example, in the EU David Cameron is seen as EUsceptic. In the UK he is seen as very EUphile.

There are plenty of backbenchers and other less important politicians willing to scapegoat the EU, even though it happens that they are forced into the same party due to the first-past-the-post system.

I think of that because I don't think I've seen it in the links you gave, but be really carefull about your restaurants, half of Paris' restaurants are only serving reheated cooked meal, a good way to check for that is if the menu have a huge bunch of differents meals, it means it isn't from fresh ingredients, so high probability that you'll eat something our of a microwave.
I can give you my favourites : 

-Le Monte Carlo, 118 Rue La Boétie, 75008 Paris
It is nothing fancy, but it's a really good brasserie with really good products, greats salads and awesome staff, but they just do lunch not supper, if you're around of the Champs-élysés at lunch that's a good place.

Iguma : http://higuma.fr/ 
They have a few restaurants around town, it's not french cuisine, but if you crave for Ramen, it's the best place to go, cheap but you'll maybe stay in line to enter inside.

If you want something really fancy and really good you can eat at Ladurée, but the check will not be nice :p


For places to Visit; if you like atchitecture you can go around in the center of Paris, you have a lot of old buildings with sculptures on their facade, sometimes when I'm bored I wonder out in Paris looking at them, it's a fun walk to have, expecially that it is mostly random so you never know what you'll find, but that's my idea of having fun.

If you want a place to drink good alcohols and rather cheap for paris you can go to  La Frange 6 Rue Cochin, (if you don't like hyper crowded places, avoid weekends but in summer it's calmer) you'll be able to meet with some awesome people, just take a drink, loose your inhibitions and star talkking to everybody :p (if you're rather prude, you'd better avoid this place ^^)

Also for transportation, if you need to take the bus/subway a lot you'd better take a Navigo Pass; for a week it's about 30€ and you have unlimited trips (useful if you use more than 3 tickets a day) Taxis are a good way to move inside paris, but by night only, during daytime it's a traffic jam nightmare due to bus lanes.

Actually, I didn't speak out against them per se. I spoke out about them being decided by Brussels rather than Wesminster. However, when looking at the detail, I do think that they are poor policies because:

- the bankers bonus tax just means that bankers get more money for non-performance related work. The consequence of this has been that bankers have less incentive to perform well. In general, taxation should not focus on the pay of people in specific industries or focus on specific components of pay, but look at the entire pay package and consider each industry equally.

- the financial transactions tax: Financial transactions are helpful things so should not be discouraged.  The best way to tax banks is to tax the profits banks make rather than individual transactions of banks.

- and the short-selling ban: This one ultimately never works. If the value of securities are going down, they go down. Stopping short-selling just gets rid of liquidity.",0,1405001523,null,0,false,0,cithw4n,t3_2a4tb8,t1_cithw4n,t1_cithi2w,null,1434643300,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,Trucidator,UKGB,City of London,"&gt; But you generally agree with the UK's policy to nag for opt-outs and special negotiated arrangements for almost everything. That's inconsistent.

Actually, my strong and repeatedly expressed preference is for the UK to leave the EU ASAP. However, to the extent that the UK stays in the EU, the UK's arrangements should reflect what the UK want, which is in many cases different from what others in the EU want. For example, the UK doesn't want the euro, while the rest of the EU does. That's why opt-outs are important.

However, none of this is inconsistent with my belief in general terms in international co-operation. It should be in the interests of both parties and in many instances it is. The UK can and will obviously co-operate with much of the world from outside the EU (as many nations in the world currently do). 

&gt; And there never will be as long as there are people who make a point of it to cultivate dislike against the EU. So the question remains: why?

Actually, shared political consciousness is not to do with ""like"". I like the people in the EU, just as I like the people in Japan and the people in Ethiopia. Liking is not enough for forming a political consciousness. I don't believe that elites should try and force a political consciousness on peoples where one doesn't currently exist.

&gt; There are plenty of backbenchers and other less important politicians willing to scapegoat the EU, even though it happens that they are forced into the same party due to the first-past-the-post system. And then I'm not even talking about the media...

Yes, those backbenchers (with very few exceptions) are still generally more pro-EU than most of the British public. Again, the UK media taken as a whole is more pro-EU than the British public.

You believe that the gross contributions should be related to GDP. This is also an ""organisational principle"". Why bother connecting gross contributions to GDP at all? Why not just say that each country has to pay an amount connected to the population size? The answer to this is because that would obviously be unfair on the poorer countries. It makes no sense for you to want fairness in relation to contributions, but to not want fairness in relation to benefits.

&gt; And? Subsidies are for farmers. Less farmers -&gt; less subsidies. I don't see the problem.

Personally I am against subsidising farmers at all, but that is another discussion. However, obviously your proposal, in which the UK has to subsidise French agriculture, is totally unfair.

&gt; Then you have a lot of work to do within the UK.

In what respects are there tax-breaks for financial institutions in the UK that aren't there for other industries?

I was responding to an analogy you introduced. I'm not sure why you introduced it. 

&gt; They were offered assistance, but refusing it. That doesn't make sense, until you consider that they're running a ""what has the EU ever done for us?"" campaign, and it would backfire politically if they gave their opponents such an easy way to disprove their assertion. So they refuse help for Britons just to solidify their own political position of power.

Britons don't need this help from the EU. So the UK government was right to refuse it.

However, to the extent that the UK stays in the EU, the UK's arrangements should reflect what the UK want, which is in many cases different from what others in the EU want. For example, the UK doesn't want the euro, while the rest of the EU does. That's why opt-outs are important.

Other countries don't *spontaneously* agree on everything either. The difference is that they put their grieves on the negotiation table, get some concessions on these points from others, concede some points themselves and then you get an agreement, not everyone doing their own preference. It's called cooperation. Just stop pretending you're in favor of cooperation - actions speak louder than words.

Generally speaking Polish people are slowly but surely getting more and more atheistic and fed up with the Church, however this probably won't result in any political change against the Church. The reason is that these sentiments do not have any solid political representation. And the reason behind that is a bit of long story...


Those pro Church laws were introduced by the right wing parties, originating in the anti-communist opposition (Solidarity). It used to be that the post communistic left party was more secular and they served as a weak but always a backstop to clergy's political ambitions. For that reason Church influence has weakened in the late 90's. However some 13 years ago some weird stuff happened. First, the right wing party split into two. Two years later, the left wing party went down in giant corruption scandal that it has not recovered from ever since. In 2005 the two right wing parties (PiS and PO) won, but instead of ruling together they became bitter enemies. This situation continues to this day and the result is that both the coalition and opposition is to some degree pro Church. The current ruling party (PO) tries to be a bit secular, but they have many very pro Church politicians in their own ranks, which makes it difficult. The opposition (PiS), which is likely to take over in a year, is pretty much directly controlled by the Church. As I said, the post communistic left (SLD) is merely a sideshow and the modern, actually anti-clerical left (Ruch Palikota or Twój Ruch) is weak and might not be represented in the next parliament.

En gros, les producteurs de cafés Fair Trade doivent payer leurs salariés un salaire ""plancher"" pour avoir droit à la certification commerce équitable, ce qui leur permet de vendre le café plus cher à travers les organismes. Du coup, bien entendu, ils paient très exactement ce plancher et pas un centime de plus. C'est positif quand les prix du café sont bas et les salaires aussi, mais quand le prix du café augmente, les salaires parmi les exploitations non-équitables augmentent, pas dans les exploitations équitables. Mon expérience personnelle, parfaitement anecdotale et insignifiante, m'a montré que **certains** exportateurs et distributeurs de café Fairtrade en Afrique de l'Ouest et en Ethiopie sont investi d'un complexe messianique, et ne paient pas plus les producteurs parce que ""Enfin, ils veulent plus d'argent?

De plus: Mettre en place et maintenir les infrastructures nécessaires, dans les pays producteurs comme dans les pays consommateurs, pour assurer les standards Fairtrade et la communication, le packaging, etc. qui va bien, coûte cher. Plus cher que parmi les grands cafetiers. Du coup, si la différence de prix est *X*, une moyenne de 0.015*x* à 0.02*x* est investi dans le tiers-monde.

Enfin: Les organismes fairtrade préfèrent les petits exploitants, qui n'ont pas le poids nécessaire pour faire face aux multinationales et sont donc intéressés par un modèle plus rémunérateur. Le problème des petits exploitants, c'est que les travailleurs de base dans les petites plantations sont encore moins payés qu'ailleurs, et les petits propriétaires traitent mal leurs employés vu qu'ils sont moins fliqués. En plus, les organismes fairtrade ont tendance à encourager les producteurs à faire du café bio, puisque le fairtrade et le bio vont bien ensemble. Problème : Le bio, ça coûte plus cher et ça produit moins.

War das erste mal dass ich das erkannt habe. Ich finde es cool, dass sich immer mehr Frauen trauen auch mal am Band zu schaffen in den Semesterferien. Jedem steht jeder Job offen in unserer Gesellschaft. Jeder soll versuchen den Job zu bekommen, den er haben will.

Ich fände es super, wenn in typisch männlich besetzen Berufen mehr Frauen arbeiten würden. Das würde sehr viel mehr gegen Sexismus bewirken als alle Erziehungsprogramme für Erwachsene die sich so mancher ausdenkt. Viele Männer würden dann Frauen auch auf gleicher Stufe (nicht nur als Chefs) mit ihnen arbeiten sehen, was ein ganz anderes Verhältnis schafft.

Man lacht oft manche Gruppen von Menschen aus... Schwule, Frauen, Männer, Kleine, Große, Schüchterne, weil man denkt sie könnten den Job den man macht nicht selbst machen und wären deswegen schwach. Das kann man nur aus der Welt schaffen indem man zeigt, dass jeder jede Arbeit machen kann, wenn er Lust darauf hat.

Cette oppression motive le Hamas à envoyer d'autres roquettes sur Israel. La boucle est bouclée.

Israel ne veut pas de la solution à deux états, et n'a jamais reconnu la Palestine en tant que pays. S'il n'était pas soutenu par les Etats-Unis, ça ferait longtemps qu'on condamnerait Israel.

The UK has made huge concessions in the EU too. Lots of things the UK has signed up to are not remotely the UK's preference.

&gt; It's called cooperation. Just stop pretending you're in favor of cooperation - actions speak louder than words.

true,rewboss,advanced,advanced,"This is an example of what my wife calls ""Reim dich oder ich hau dich"" -- ""Rhyme, or I'll smack you"". Germans are traditionally fond of a particular type of doggerel, with a simple rhyming scheme and often in some simple rhythm: this is iambic tetrameter.

Sometimes, in order to get the lines to scan and rhyme, they have to do some small violence to what we understand to be German grammar; sometimes they employ old-fashioned grammar rules, or what they think are old-fashioned grammar rules.

We do sometimes something similar in English. For example, Wordsworth's poem *I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud* includes the following couplet:

&gt; I gazed -- and gazed -- but little thought  
What wealth the show to me had bought.

In this case, it's actually just a couple of small things; namely:

* ""getrost"" would normally come after the ""es"",
* ""Ich fühl"" should normally be ""Ich fühle"",
* ""Herze"" should normally be ""Herz"".

It is actually quite common in everyday speech to say ""ich fühl"" instead of ""ich fühle"", while ""Herze"" is a very old-fashioned form of ""Herz"" which might have been used in the 14th century.

These changes were simply made to give the rhyme the ""da-DUM-da-DUM-da-DUM-da-DUM-da"" rhythm.

This kind of doggerel isn't, thankfully, as popular as it once was.

These regulations are enacting the same regulations as existed before.

I think a lot of people are seriously confused about what is going on. 

Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband have got Cameron to commit to a review of GCHQ's surveillance powers in exchange. In fact this has turned out quite nicely.

L'idea mi piace un sacco, ci metto un'opinione personale in merito però: anche la storia delle lobby è un po' vecchia, sebbene molte teorie complottistiche sarebbero difficili da fondare senza, inoltre non spiegherebbe perché gli esseri umani non mangiano cacca dagli albori della società. 

La storia che ci metterei io dietro è questa: 

Gli esseri umani sono sempre stati coprofagi fin dall'antichità, il problema è sorto con l'avvento del Cristianesimo che ha provato in tutti i modi di far conciliare l'immagine di un uomo che agisce secondo natura (ossia il volere divino) con quella di un uomo che reintroduce nel proprio corpo qualcosa che il corpo stesso aveva espulso! 

Se nelle prime fasi del Cristianesimo questo è stato difficile, con l'avvento del medioevo gli storiografi Cristiani hanno potuto ridisporre le carte in tavola a loro piacere. Lo sterco era presente in tutti i testi antichi come spuntino quotidiano, ma questi sono stati abilmente riadattati: ogni volta, la parola latina ""merda"" è stata prontamente sostituita dalla parola ""merenda"", facendo scomparire una volta per tutte la coprofagia dalla storia dell'umanità.

[Will the U.S. ‘Rebalance’ Its Contribution to NATO?](http://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2013/10/will-us-rebalance-its-contribution-nato/72281/)

&gt;Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is on his way to Brussels to have a difficult conversation with his fellow defense ministers in NATO. The point of contention is the continued reduction of the military capabilities of our allies and their growing dependence on U.S. support.

&gt;Hagel will repeat to European allies the stark message made by Robert Gates on his last trip to Brussels as defense secretary. Gates made international headlines with his warning of *“a dim, if not dismal future”* for NATO if it continues to be divided *“between those willing and able to pay the price and bear the burdens of alliance commitments, and those who enjoy the benefits of NATO membership… but don’t want to share the risks and the costs.”*

[U.S. military says it may have to cut Europe budget by fifth](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/21/us-usa-defence-europe-idUSBRE9AK1FX20131121)

&gt;*(Reuters)* - The United States may be compelled to cut its military spending in Europe next year by as much as a fifth in the latest round of reductions under ""sequestration"", America's top general in the region said on Thursday.

&gt;U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove, who serves as both head of the U.S. European Command (EUCOM) and as NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), said the reductions will require NATO forces to work more closely together and train ""smarter"".

-----------------------------------------

&gt;Breedlove also noted increased competition for Pentagon resources, particularly from Asia, to which President Barack Obama has said the United States will ""pivot"" its resources as part of a strategic rebalance.

America is trying to *""Pivot to the Pacific""*, not get stuck in a old Cold War scenario with Russia. With the next century nicknamed the *""Asian  Century""* and China on the rise, we don't want to be distracted &amp; tied down by Europe. 

Especially since the European Union is not only capable of taking care of it's own backyard, but a natural ally of ours to boot when dealing with other international players.

Serbia was not invading anyone, in fact the Serbian military (or Yugoslavian military) did very little at all. In simple terms what happened was that Yugoslavia was breaking up into independent states due to nationalism (partly driven by the Serbs grabbing more and more power in Yugoslavia). However, the state borders did not go along the borders of ethnic populations. The fighting was between Croatian and Bosnian Serbs who wanted their lands to be a part of Serbia instead of Croatia or Bosnia, and Bosniaks and Croats who wanted those lands to be a part of their state (Croats also fought Bosniaks, but that's beside the point here).

Especially in the case of Croatia people should understand the historical context of Croatian Serbs. Croatia has a long history of nationalism, which included running one of the worst concentration camps of WWII, where they locked up Serbs (even the SS officers called these people crazy). It's not surprising that the Serbs were not too happy about the prospect of being put under Croatian nationalists, so they fought to be a part of Serbia instead.

Another thing to understand about the Balkans is that the ethnic groups have been stirred and mixed by a history of living between the big powers in Europe (Austria-Hungary) and middle east (the Ottomans). That means that the border between ethnic groups are not clear. When there are wars in Balkans, it's always about trying to come up with a clear division between the groups through ethnic cleansing. In the breakup wars the Serbs were organized and in many cases the civilian populations left areas where they were minorities early due to the fear of ethnic cleansing. The sadistic leaders of Croatian and Bosnian Serbs then ordered and carried out ethnic cleansing of their own in the border areas, fueled by political support from Milosevic and his drive to build a greater Serbia to get more power for himself.",0,1405015194,null,0,false,0,citow1d,t3_2aahfy,t1_citow1d,t1_citcxgg,null,1434647821,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

When you exit, you don't need to use your ticket...the doors just open.  BUT, keep your ticket.  We got stopped by the metro ""police"" checking for tickets inside a metro once.  We were surprised, didn't think about keeping the tickets before...our pockets were full of tickets, some new, so used.  Ahh but the used and the new are the same, you can't tell.  They have little devises that scan them to see if and when it was used.  We found one ticket and the other we couldn't find.  They told us we had to pay a $100 euro penalty right there.  They had a credit card machine and all.  We told them no way, we didn't jump the gates and would give them a new ticket if we must.

true,Titanomakhia,ENGL,England,"Yes but by a court that does not have the power to affect national laws passed in this area. The ECJ has the power to punish countries that make laws that violate the treaties and it also has the power to strike down EU made legislation if it violates the ECHR (which is not part of the treaties but something the EU must abide by). It does not have the power to affect our own laws should they breach the ECHR - only the European Court of Human Rights can do that and even then it's only a request that we change the law. 

It's kind of like, to take a random country, an Italian court ruling that a law it passed breached the ECHR. That decision has no effect on the UK nor on how UK judges decide if we passed the same law nor on how European human rights judges will decide. Both sets of judges could take the decision into account though and decide to copy the other court. The problem is that we were relying on the EU law to make our use of phone records by police legal. That's been changed suddenly and it's suddenly become illegal to collect that data. No doubt there are ongoing court cases, future court cases and investigations into Syrian fighters going on right now and the government really doesn't want to lose the phone records. Activists will soon be able (unless this re-enactment is passed) to sue phone companies and force them to destroy records currently being used (or that will be used) by the police as evidence in investigations. That's the emergency and why it's being rushed through. The police will lose access to phone data they might need if the companies destroy the data and they are being threatened with legal action already - the government has highlighted the Syria issue as to why it's particularly necessary. Activists could start legal action tomorrow to force the destruction of the data so the government wants to act fast. 

Others here mentioned the lack of opposition:

&amp;gt; In return for agreeing to back the legislation, Labour and the Lib Dems highlighted new moves to ""increase transparency and oversight"", including:

&gt;• The creation of a new Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to scrutinise the impact of the law on privacy and civil liberties

&gt;• Annual government transparency reports on how these powers are used

&gt;• The appointment of a senior former diplomat to lead discussions with the US government and internet firms to establish a new international agreement for sharing data between legal jurisdictions

&gt;• A restriction on the number of public bodies, including Royal Mail, able to ask for communications data under the controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA)

&gt;• Termination clause ensuring these powers expire at the end of 2016

&gt;• A wider review of the powers needed by government during the next parliament.

So in other words the government needs help to act asap to maintain the status quo and in exchange we get some small limits on privacy infringing regulations, a new oversight board to oversee the privacy implications of retention, a 2 year limit on the current laws in which we will have an extended public debate during an election year combined with a review of the necessity of the current rules AND every year the government will report on how surveillance and data retention effect people. 

It seems like a win to me. It would have been nice if there had been more of a public discussion but the government is working to a very short time frame (which has already effectively run out) and they have now set aside 2 years for public debate of these issues to make up for it. I hope the Lib Dems make it front and centre for their manifesto in 2015: I have a feeling that's why Nick Clegg wanted the 2 year limit so he (or whoever replaces him) can slam Cameron on civil liberties in the election.

Dass Sprachvarietäten (wie Kiezdeutsch oder Dialekt) mit einem Stigma versehen ist, das ist IMHO der interessantere Punkt.

But not just any motto: ""Glory to Ukraine""  is also the motto of the [**Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists...**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Ukrainian_Nationalists)which is a far-right, populist and nationalist party.

It was founded and lead until her death by Slava Tstesko.  She became a member of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) in 1938. When a schism occurred within the OUN in 1940, she went with the wing of the OUN led by Stepan Bandera. 

The OUN-M wing led by Melnik admired Mussolini but didn't like Hitler, while the OUN-B admired Hitler.

And what do you know, her husband was [Yaroslav Tstetsko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaroslav_Stetsko#The_Nazis_and_the_OUN), an associate of Stepan Bandera: on 30 June 1941, Stetsko declared in Lviv the formation of a Ukrainian state which *""will closely cooperate with the National-Socialist Greater Germany, under the leadership of its leader Adolf Hitler which is forming a new order in Europe and the world""*.

In August 1941 Stetsko wrote his autobiography. It was addressed to the German authorities, and contained several notable antisemitic passages, in particular he stated that he considered Marxism a product of Jewish thought, that was put into practice by the Muscovite-Asiatic people with Jewish assistance; that Moscow and the Jewry are the carriers of the international ideas of the Bolsheviks. 

He stated that although he consider Moscow rather than Jewry to be the main enemy of imprisoned Ukraine, he absolutely endorses the idea of the indubitable harmful role of Jews in the enslavement of Ukraine by Moscow. He finally states that he absolutely endorses the extermination of Jews, and the rationality of the German methods of extermination of Jews, instead of assimilating them

Now, just compare all this with [the declarations of Svoboda leader ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleh_Tyahnybok)Oleh Tyahnybok: ""[You are the ones] that the Moscow-Jewish mafia ruling Ukraine fears most""[11] ""They were not afraid and we should not be afraid.

Poi cominciano a saltare fuori thread (seri o faceti ) su

- Perché i mod non sono ancora intervenuti?
- Perchè alcuni mod non sono più presenti qui?
- Perchè quelli non presenti non vengono rimossi?
- I mod di r/italy sono incompetenti, richiediamo una loro dimissione
- Quando cazzo è che ci faremo rimuovere da quel covo di razzisti?
- Ma quanto sono ghei i mod?

Poi qualcuno ha avuto la genialissima idea di fare il biancavaliere e di raidare $subredditrassista non aspettando che i mod fossero intervenuti, facendosi rappresentare quale ""utente di r/italy"", facendo scatenare il loro buttorto e facendoli venire qui e far partire la merdatempesta.

Bastava aspettare e tutto si sarebbe risolto con l'intervento dei mod.

Espandendo poi la mia precedente risposta a /u/impiegato_statale, il fatto che noi ci lamentiamo tanto deriva dal fatto che Roma è una città dimensionalmente grande, che attira tanta gente, e che in media ha fisiologicamente più magagne di altri centri urbani.

La mia ragazza (non romana) una volta ci definì fanatici, e lì per lì quasi mi offesi, ma a distanza di tempo, osservando me e miei amici, per certi aspetti riconosco che aveva ragione.

Ma nonostante tutto siamo anche [consapevoli](http://www.romafaschifo.com) dei nostri problemi, e se pare che siamo lamentosi, un po' e perché ci teniamo molto alla nostra città, un po' è perché con tanti abitanti si hanno proporzionalmente tanti cazzi.

true,rewboss,advanced,advanced,"&gt; Neben is apparently 'next to' not 'near'. 'Nah' = near. In English, this would be interchangeable.

No, not at all. If the man is sitting in row 4, seat 1, the seat next to him is row 4, seat 2. If you take row 3, seat 3, you're definitely sitting *near* him, but you're also definitely not sitting *next to* him.

&gt; But why is there a 'zu' in front of sein?

Because of the verb ""scheinen"", which is followed by ""zu"" + infinitive. In the other sentence

&gt; Wir möchten übermorgen fertig sein

""möchten"" is followed by the infinitive form *without* ""zu"".

Germans learning English have a similar difficulty when they have to choose between a verb followed by ""to"" + infinitive, and one followed by the present participle; so Germans have to learn that we say ""I hate to read..."" but ""I finished reading...""

Purtroppo si. Solitamente compravo il Corriere Della Sera perchè non tanto tempo fa era un buon giornale. Ogni tanto compravo anche Repubblica per leggere un'altra opinione, e mi piaceva molto la rivista XL come allegato; peccato che quel tipo di riviste siano arrivate tardi sul mercato, proprio quando quella tipologia di lettori fece il salto dal cartaceo al digitale.

Negli ultimi anni si è anche visto come il Corriere si sia auto-silurato, come del resto lo ha fatto anche Repubblica diventanto una testata personalizzata di certe persone e certe filosofie poco signorili. Entrambe le grosse testate hanno perduto molti contenuti culturali, trascendendo nel gossip che ha fatto perdere la qualità giornalistica; specialmente quando iniziarono gli scandali dei vizietti privati a luci rosa e rosse di Berlusconi, lì iniziò una palude che, a mio parere, inaugurò il tracollo di queste grandi testate: non si può mettere in prima pagine il _bunga bunga_ altalenandolo con lo _spread_ e basta.

Il sito del Corriere dal 2010 al 2013 è stato lo specchio più pacchiano dei grandi giornali, ed anche lì la front page era sempre su gossip, calcio, frivolezze e _copy paste_ di video ed immagini presi a zonzo da Reddit o siti simili, seguiti da pessimi articoli scritti male. Del resto il giornale di via Solferino sembra abbia scialacquato troppo rapidamente i propri guadagni in spese puerili.

Ma anche l'Unità è al tracollo, ad un passo dalla chiusura totale. Un giornale che a me non ha mai interessato, ma ha fatto il suo persorso interessante politico nei tempi in cui doveva farlo; purtroppo, da quando la sinistra italiana è scomparsa assieme ai suoi contenuti, la stessa sorte è accaduta al suo giornale.

Soffre anche il Sole24ore con perdite una dopo l'altra, e nonostante sia un giornale serio ed apprezzato, ciò significa che la crisi editoriale è a 360 gradi; molto probabilmente per la bassa qualità dei contenuti, ma del resto rimango convinto che pagare due soldi i collaboratori risulti solo in articoli da due soldi.

true,Cyg789,null,null,"Der Spiegel-Artikel ist imho missverständlich formuliert. Und zwar in dem Sinne, dass das Urteil vor Allem deswegen gefällt wurde, weil das Gesetz die Familienzusammenführung erschwere. 

Wenn man sich einmal die [Pressemitteilung des EUGh](http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2014-07/cp140096de.pdf)
im Kontext der türkischen Beitrittsverhandlungen zur EU ansieht, wird allerdings klar: Der EUGh hatte keine Wahl, als so zu urteilen, Deutschland verstößt mit diesem Gesetz gegen Unionsrecht. Das hat der Spiegel zwar auch geschrieben, allerdings eher in einem Nebensatz.

Die Türkei verhandelt seit 1956 mit der EU und ihren Vorgängern über einen Beitritt. Im Rahmen dieser Verhandlungen wurden immer wieder in kleinen Schritten Verträge abgeschlossen, so eben auch in den 70er Jahren das in der Pressemitteilung des EUGh zitierte Assoziierungsabkommen samt der Stillhalteklausel. Daran muss sich die BRD nun einmal halten. 

Ich finde folgende Passage in der Pressemitteilung vielsagend:

&gt;Schließlich kann zwar die Einführung einer neuen Beschränkung zugelassen werden, sofern sie durch einen zwingenden Grund des Allgemeininteresses gerechtfertigt und geeignet ist, die Erreichung des angestrebten legitimen Zieles zu erreichen, und nicht über das zu dessen Erreichung Erforderliche hinausgeht, doch hält der Gerichtshof diese Voraussetzungen im vorliegenden Fall nicht für gegeben. 

&gt; Er führt hierzu aus, dass, auch wenn man davon ausgeht, dass die von der deutschen Regierung angeführten Gründe (die Bekämpfung von Zwangsverheiratungen und die Förderung der Integration) zwingende Gründe des Allgemeininteresses darstellen können, eine nationale 
Regelung wie das fragliche Spracherfordernis **über das hinausgeht, was zur Erreichung des verfolgten Ziels erforderlich ist, da der fehlende Nachweis des Erwerbs hinreichender Sprachkenntnisse automatisch zur Ablehnung des Antrags auf Familienzusammenführung führt, ohne dass besondere Umstände des Einzelfalls berücksichtigt werden.**


Im Endeffekt sagt der EUGh: Liebe Leute, wenn denn Eurer Ziel wirklich nur die Verhinderung von Zwangsheiraten und Verbesserung der Integration  **gewesen sein sollte**, dann seid ihr mit dem Gesetz aber mächtig über das Ziel hinausgeschossen, denn a) verstosst Ihr gegen ein Abkommen mit der Türkei b) kann man das auch anders erreichen und c) schert Ihr alle über einen Kamm, ohne Euch die Betroffenen überhaupt einmal anzuschauen.

Was die Kommentare betrifft, die Dame hätte in der Türkei lesen und schreiben lernen können und Deutsch ebenfalls: Ich habe 2 Jahre in der Türkei gelebt, und dort auch studiert. So einfach ist das mit der Erwachsenenbildung dort nicht. Und das gilt nur für Großstädte. Auf dem Land, wo die Frau höchstwahrscheinlich herkommen wird, ist es einem Erwachsenen so gut wie völlig unmöglich, noch einmal die Schule zu besuchen, geschweige denn, Deutsch zu lernen. Das könnt ihr vergessen. Ich halte es für sinnvoller, die Leute im Rahmen dessen, was möglich ist, in Deutschland verpflichtend zu Deutsch- und Integrationskursen zu schicken.

It starts with american shadow companies which work hand in hand with the CIA to kidnap foreigners. Following they interview some African immigrants which were questioned by the BND and CIA about their relatives in Africa. There is no law that forces them to answer, but they get deported if they don't tell them all what they want to hear. Even if it is untrue. Based an that, they bomb African people with drones, controlled from Germany, because they could be terrorists. The reporters visited some relatives of a victim of a dronestrike there. So actually Germany is helping the US to kill random people who could be terrorists.
The crazy thing is that no one thinks that that Germany is responsible for the US actions on German soil. So my opinion is that they should close the stations because the operations are against basic laws of Germany.

I'm very sure you are Polish from what you have written, so I'll just assume it (almost every paragraph makes it more clear)

Don't go to 3) if you are not completely convinced you want to do medicine, pharmaceutics or related. Lot of study and almost no one will have similar interests as /r/Europe (politics is the last subject they will be talking about). Well, these people are the opposite of passionate scientists and politicians.

People in 1) will be generally less interesting and will often go there just because they had to go somewhere or they failed at getting to 2) or 3) - and trust me, this is true at any level! (I've graduated from this year's number 1 Polish high school)

If you are smart and can stand maths, do 2).
I've just finished high school and can tell you that extended Maths and IT class was the best EVEN for me (finalist in Geography Olympiad and Warsaw School of Economics student from October).

I can't say anything about 4) as it wasn't offered in my school but I think people often have the same problems with science as people from 1), but are just more interested in economics.

Anyway, 2) will prepare you best for Maths exam and this is what is the most important subject. IT REALLY IS. Also, you don't need many English hours (which are probably offered at 4) ) - I was worse at English than you 3 years ago and now I've passed CAE with A even though I had 12-13 weekly hours of English throughout 3 years.


EDIT: Of course, the primary reason why you should not go to 1) is that you won't get any job :D

I don't know whether it's good to do what you want to do, but my ""philosophy"" in life is to combine what I like (Economics) with what gives the most opportunity (Strongly mathematic sciences (but not Mathematics itself ;) )) and now I will be doing Quantative Methods in Economics and Information Systems, which is mostly data science - for those not in the topic - you can call it mathematical economics.

Ukraine is not the EU. Russia won't dare to touch the EU because a year after they did, there'd be no Russia west of the Ural: NATO isn't needed for that. The military prowess isn't even comparable, and just because the EU isn't busy projecting power in front of China's coast doesn't mean we're defenceless.

During the consideration process they came to the conclusion that Germany and the US just have divergent interests. Take for example Russia. I imagine many of you have heard of the intimidation tactic called gas lighting? It was invented by the Stasi to drive opponents insane slowly. Since 2005, all US diplomats posted to Russia have been subjected to gaslight harassment by the FSB. In the wake of the color revolutions in Europe Putin set up summer camps for youth (Putler Youth camps) where they indoctrinated young people with nationalistic ideology. These camps also had propaganda posters everywhere warning of the US enemy out to destroy Russia. Remember this is in 2005, at the height of the German Chancellor's bromance with V. Putin. It doesn't help that Shroeder(a man not so far removed from power) went to work for Gazprom upon retirement which is essentially going on Putin's payroll. Iran is also an interesting case. Most of the Iranian nuclear program we knowingly helped along by Siemens despite US objections which has essentially led to the dangerous standoff today. There is also the fact that the Hamburg Cell was radicalized in Germany. I mean if your last Chancellor is literally on Putin's payroll and German companies knowingly supplied Iran with the equipment to make nuclear weapons how can Germany claim to be so outraged. Not that we don't like you, but Germany is clearly a huge security risk. Now Merkel may be pro-American but what happens when the next Putin sympathizer gets on board?

true,lamazor,null,null,"Bonjour. Je suis psychologue (et ce n'est pas mon compte). Effectivement j'ai donc une formation avec un BAC + 5 et ne suis pas médecin. Le psychiatre est un médecin possédant un doctorat. Saches que toute personne en France a le droit d'aller voir un psychologue ou un psychiatre et tu n'a pas besoin de passer par le médecin généraliste. Les psychiatres sont remboursés par la SECU mais pas les psychologues en libéral (à quelques exceptions près par des mutuelles ou sur certaines problématiques particulières relevant d'un réseau de soin). Tu peux cependant avoir des prises en charges avec un psychologue gratuitement en hôpital parfois ou en CMP (psychoposh a très bien décrit le fonctionnement des CMP). Je ne vais pas particulièrement prêcher ma paroisse, à toi de voir si tu veux un psychiatre ou un psychologue. Le psychiatre a une approche médicale, il considère avant tout les symptômes (angoisse, stress, cauchemars...), et apporte une réponse médicamenteuse. Il s'agit d'un spécialiste bien mieux formé qu'un médecin traitant pour prescrire des antidépresseurs. Le psychologue a plus une approche globale, considérant le personne dans son rapport aux autres et à elle même. De toute façon, les deux seront là pour t'écouter et te réorienter si besoin est vers un confrère. Certaines personnes peuvent avoir un suivi avec un psychiatre et un psychologue en parallèle. 
Demander à ton médecin traitant, si tu le connais bien, de te conseiller, est une bonne idée. 
Je voulais rajouter surtout que le fait de se poser la question est souvent le signe que tu es prêt à entamer un travail sur toi. N'hésite pas à rencontrer plusieurs professionnels avant de choisir la personne avec qui tu souhaites avoir un suivi. Sache aussi que passer le pas et entrer dans un CMP ne signifie pas obligatoirement une thérapie longue ! C'est un travail qui se construit à deux avec le psychologue.

I did my BA studies in English Lit. at a private university and there were people who couldn't even speak English properly but still managed to get a diploma. There even was an exam where like 80% of the class was cheating and I actually overheard the professor's assistant telling him ""you do know that all of them are copying right?"" and his reply ""yeah I know, what can you do?""

Also one of my teachers continuously kept pronouncing piano as pie-anno and ""creature"" not with a long ""i"" sound but like the word ""create"". It made me mad every single time but I didn't dare to correct her.

So I went and got an MA degree in English Lit from Hungary instead of getting it in Romania.

I don't know what's the situation at state universities in Romania, but the professionalism I encountered at the Hungarian university blew my fucking mind. Also for the first year I was struggling to reach the level of my colleagues who did their BA there in Hungary.

So I for one can only recommend private universities to people who actually have the willpower to study on their own, otherwise the lower expectation level of the university will just ruin your education since most people only tend to do the bare minimum that is required of them.

The main practical effect of the ICAO's refusal to recognize Northern Cypriot airspace is that there can't be direct flights between Northern Cyprus and any other country besides Turkey, because other countries won't let flights to or from their airports fly an itinerary that enters Cypriot airspace without clearance of the ICAO-designated controller.

Also the quality of recording devices back then as well as the distortion from the stage equipment of this time (microphone, amplifier etc) make it sound even sharper.

1. There is no ideal way in general for politics; there are just different people who have different opinions.

From the article: ""Refugees must be provided with more ways to enter the EU [...]
From the report:
States should offer more safe and legal routes to refugees to access protection in their countries :
  Increasing resettlement and humanitarian admission places for refugees.  
  Facilitating family reunification for refugees who have family members living abroad.  
  Applying a broad definition of family members to include extended or non-nuclear family.  ""

How is that not going to result in more immigration?

Be that as it may, a result of the conditions placed upon Austria after the first and second world war is that the Austrian national identity is built (among other things) on the myths of non-germanhood and neutrality. I call these myths because they aren't organically grown, not because I believe that Austria should unify with Germany and march against France again. People aren't in favour of neutrality, the *Opfermythos*, Austrian identity, *Gulasch*, and *Apfelstrudel* because of primarily political concerns, but because those are things that define ""Austrian"". 

I think it would be hard to convince a majority of Austrians to give up fully on neutrality unless they were confronted after the fact with the new reality of partiality, when Austrian *Wurschtigkeit* would make it palatable.

Edit: here it is: 
&gt; I think that a description of any loud, stirring, tumultuous episode must be tamer in German than in English. Our descriptive words of this character have such a deep, strong, resonant sound, while their German equivalents do seem so thin and mild and energyless. Boom, burst, crash, roar, storm, bellow, blow, thunder, explosion; howl, cry, shout, yell, groan; battle, hell. These are magnificent words; the have a force and magnitude of sound befitting the things which they describe. But their German equivalents would be ever so nice to sing the children to sleep with, or else my awe-inspiring ears were made for display and not for superior usefulness in analyzing sounds. Would any man want to die in a battle which was called by so tame a term as a Schlacht? Or would not a consumptive feel too much bundled up, who was about to go out, in a shirt-collar and a seal-ring, into a storm which the bird-song word Gewitter was employed to describe? And observe the strongest of the several German equivalents for explosion -- Ausbruch. Our word Toothbrush is more powerful than that. It seems to me that the Germans could do worse than import it into their language to describe particularly tremendous explosions with. The German word for hell -- Hölle -- sounds more like helly than anything else; therefore, how necessary chipper, frivolous, and unimpressive it is.

Tell me, do you know many Russians?  What makes you think they want what you think is a ""free Russia?""  I presume you mean a Western-Style Democratic Russia.  Many Russians like a strong leader and believe it is necessary to maintain order in a huge country.  Order is values over ""freedom.""  Look a Putins' popularity numbers, especially since Ukraine.  There is a lot of nationalism as well, and military prowess might be values by some over a ""free Russia.""

I don't see how the EU can ever have security without a strong Germany.   And I don't see how the EU will ever be taken seriously if it cannot defend itself.  At the same time, if you can't help defend your neighbor (who is also in NATO with you) because of historical difficulties, I'm not sure what kind of union it is in the first place.

The EU was built on the vision of the 90's, that history was ""over,"" and that it would be all cooperation going forward.  The US had that type of naive thinking too.  But we've all seen that history is not over, it still matters.

Who will ever surpass Germany?  You have a large population, huge economy and are situated at the epicenter of Europe.  Do you expect the French to take that role?  The Italians?

&gt;I also think that a bossy Germany would do more harm than good to European cohesion.

Southern Europe already thinks you are bossy, but it really doesn't matter much.  I'll repeat, without a strong Germany, the EU cannot work.  You have a great opportunity to be assertive, with the US spying on you.  This should be a clear sign that the US does not have your best interests in mind.  Use this to distance yourself from us, and become a strong country.  

WWII is over, no country has ever repented and made things right like Germany.  FWIW, I say this as an American Jew.  But if your neighbors, who you are in an economic/political union and military alliance with, still cannot trust you, it is time to take stock of things.

*Le constructeur déploie ses cinq premiers superchargeurs dans l’Hexagone. Ils permettent aux possesseurs de Model S de venir recharger leur batterie.*

C’est un début modeste mais symbolique. Le constructeur américain Tesla va annoncer vendredi matin le lancement de ses cinq premiers superchargeurs en France. Outre l’inauguration officielle d’une première borne (intégrant deux prises) à Auxerre, le groupe va lancer, d’ici la fin de l’année, des infrastructures à Chasse-sur-Rhône, Macon, Nîmes, et Aix-en-Provence, précise-t-il aux « Echos ». Chaque emplacement proposera entre six et huit prises. « Nous aurons ainsi la route vers la Côte d’Azur totalement couverte » indique-t-on chez Tesla. Et d’ici à la fin 2015, la France accueillera près de 25 implantations.
Ces superchargeurs permettent aux possesseurs de Model S — la berline électrique de luxe du constructeur, vendue à 80.000 euros — de venir recharger gratuitement en mode ultrarapide (80 % de la batterie rechargée en 40 minutes, promet le constructeur), grâce à une puissance de 120 kW. A plein, la Model S affiche plus de 400 km d’autonomie, soit bien davantage que les autres modèles électriques (moins de 150 km).

**Volonté d’internationaliser les ventes**

Rapporté à la taille du marché automobile français, cette annonce est bien sûr très modeste. Depuis le début d’année, il s’est immatriculé 164 Model S en France — contre dix-sept sur l’année 2013 — à comparer avec 2.100 Renault Zoé ou 822 Leaf, les autres modèles de voitures électriques. Des tout petits volumes, à l’image de l’électrique qui ne pèse que 0,42 % du marché français.
Ces premiers pas concrétisent pourtant la volonté de Tesla d’internationaliser ses ventes (22.500 voitures en 2013), qui se concentraient l’année dernière à plus de 90 % aux Etats-Unis. Son charismatique fondateur, Elon Musk (également cofondateur de Paypal et du lanceur Space X) vise cette année les 35.000 ventes . Sur le Vieux Continent, le groupe vise 30 points de ventes supplémentaires (déjà deux en France), Il compte à date trente-deux superchargeurs dans la région.

**Valorisation équivalente à Renault**

Tesla vient aussi de débuter la commercialisation de sa Model S en Chine, où il vise 5.000 ventes cette année. Une goutte d’eau là aussi, mais la marque compte sur la volonté du gouvernement chinois de lutter contre la pollution des villes. Hier, les autorités ont d’ailleurs annoncé l’exemption de la taxe à l’achat (10 % du prix de vente) pour les voitures électriques.
D’autres projets sont au feu. Le constructeur californien lancera début 2015 un SUV, le Model X, et travaille à construction d’une usine de batteries aux Etats-Unis. Du côté des infrastructures, la marque a annoncé en juin l’ouverture de ses brevets liés à ses superchargeurs, afin de permettre aux autres marques de venir charger sur ses bornes.
Les investisseurs sont pour l’heure séduits. Malgré son faible volume de voitures, Tesla affiche une capitalisation boursière de 27,7 milliards de dollars, soit une valorisation équivalente à celle de Renault, qui vend pourtant 2,6 millions de voitures à l’année et détient 43,4 % de parts dans Nissan. Le tout alors même que Tesla n’est pas rentable (74 millions de dollars de pertes nettes en 2013) et dépend en partie des subventions aux énergies vertes… « Success-story » ou bulle, la question reste ouverte.

I used to be like ""What the hell is up with Putin! How can people love his shirtless photos!"" and stuff like that.  But they basically explained to me that Russian culture is so different then US/Western culture, that I was looking at it the wrong way.  That people were traumatized by the anarchy of the Yelstin years, and how historically Russia has needed strong leaders to maintain any semblance of order.  They also say that it is impossible for an outsider to ever fully understand Russia.  

Now I don't agree with a LOT of stuff that Putin does, but it is so simplistic of the ""West"" to think that everyone wants to live our lifestyle.  

Personally I think it was a HUGE mistake to have NATO expand to Russia's doorstep.  Especially after we hand a handshake deal with Gorbachev not to do so.  But I guess we needed ore countries to sell weapons to, but they don't even buy them!  

I want the US out of NATO, and out of Europe.  It is beyond ridiculous that we are occupying rich, industrialized and technically advanced countries that have their own arms industry so long after WWII and the Cold War.

It absolutely does. 

&gt; mccarthyism and subtle racism on your side. You still believe that the ""reds"" are here 

this has nothing to do with communism or ideology. This has to do with the fact that China's global influence is rising rapidly while European global influence is declining. 

Currently, the center of global power is the North Atlantic. Nations of the North Atlantic dictate the norms and standards of the global economy. This power is switching to the South China Sea, and in 50 years it will be China who dictates international norms to its neighbors in the South China Sea. This will profoundly affect the way European society works and the way Europe interacts with the world.

&gt; fevered conspiracy theories

Is it really a fever conspiracy theory to say that the central objective of Chinese policy is to take over from the United States, Japan and Germany as the world’s premier source of advanced manufactured products? and to move control of the global economy from the North Atlantic to the South China Sea?

And is it really a conspiracy theory to assert that Beijing is pressuring Berlin.

That's an ancient myth. And could be reversed also: Russians can never fully understand west. But it is not true. The thing is that even Russians themselves don't understand ""Russia"". They have been exposed to such brainwashing and lack of true information that they don't have tools to dig out what's really going on. When they get confused, they seek comfort from nostalgia, history and mystic elements like Orthodoxy (it's not rational, it's closer to Islam and east than ie. protestantism or Catholicism). Also they have this alphabet barrier and they don't teach other languages in schools like west does so they grow up in a ""barrel"". Also they have been under ""slavery"" for so long that it is in their culture/ still strong:

&gt;In 1382 the Golden Horde under Khan Tokhtamysh sacked Moscow, burning the city and carrying off thousands of inhabitants as slaves; such raids were made routinely until well into the 16th century.[8]  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Russia

The Tsar's didn't end the slavery, it was one of the reasons why October revolution started 1917. Russian are ready to be under harsh order, it is their historical tradition. And Stalin is seen as a great man because he was slavering the nation and brought great success by conquering half of Europe and sending a man to space. Even he killed 20 million of his own people. And those who might have a different opinion, they are silenced. By a nagant or other (Siberia) methods. 

&gt;I want the US out of NATO, and out of Europe. It is beyond ridiculous that we are occupying rich, industrialized and technically advanced countries that have their own arms industry so long after WWII and the Cold War. 

Occupying? Any examples? And NATO... you do understand that Europe might not want to shoot down Russian nukes flying over Europe to USA then (if USA gets out of NATO?). 

If USA will lost it's credibility... then the dollar will collapse and USA's economy will sink like the Titanic...
