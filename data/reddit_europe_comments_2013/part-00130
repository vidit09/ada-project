I mean you have a bankrupt country. Like completly bankrupt, which can't get no other loan, and can't even pay it's own employees next month so they can pay rent &amp; co. You obviously need at least *some* money to even get by next month and pay every employees a little so they don't outright start a revolution. So you first go for the investors. 

And when that still isn't even close to be enough you will merge a few big banks. Then you'll have to get some of the money sleeping around meaning the biggest accounts (the most rich people).

The fact they stood by an hair cut (even big) and only above 100K€ means most people who does not have much won't loose anything and even the rich won't loose too much, and everyone will in fact be able to keep their job and life to goes on as usual. It means you still get food or a home or power because 1°) you can pay for it 2°) the guys doing the job to bring you food or utilities get paid for it by the state too.

If you don't do it the entire system collapse. And a country collapse (real, total bankruptcy, quickly creating total chaos a few weeks down the road because critical systems and infrastructure ain't running/maintained) in occident is a big no no and would be a disaster beyond reckoning. Think greece except *nobody* has anything and unemployemnt is not 30% but 90% and even remaining businesses can't run because everyone runs out of money, utilities ain't working (no gaz no power no water no trash cars no imported food no airports no subsidiaries no tax system no welfare no...).

Then you have other mechanism like foreign loans from the rest of Europe wanting to help anyway (the BCE backed german/french/UK money for example) and trying to stop the bleeding on the tax fraud and island tax heaven evasion too, equilibrating budgets, debt restructurations,etc but all those are already worked on too.

http://www.bettertogether.net/

For a while they were pushing ""Real Scots"" as a tag line. 

&gt;  “Alistair Darling says Better Together campaign will be led by **real Scots**“

&gt;   “**Real Scots** backing Britain – Forty Scots from different walks of life spoke up for the UK at the Better Together launch.”

&gt;  “In contrast to the separatist campaign, our materials don’t attack the other side of the argument. We simply offer facts, and the perspective of **real Scots** who offer their reasons for sticking together in the UK.”

&gt; “The Better Together launch event on Monday was a great success and we couldn’t have wished for a better start or better reaction from the media. It was all a marked contrast to the celebrity soaked SNP event of a few weeks earlier and recognised as such because what we had were **real Scots** proclaiming their belief in the value of the Union to them as Scots and saying so unashamedly and directly.”

&gt;  “Better Together was launched in June this year by Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats and since its formation it has been aiming to reach out to and be focussed on **real Scots** from all walks of life.”

&gt;  “Where the SNP had a few foreign-based luvvies telling us how much they loved Scotland, the better campaign had **real Scots** who actually live here telling us why they believed it was better for Scotland to remain within the UK.”

Risk spreads on bonds can tell you a lot! The fact that the Polish guvvie spreads nearly halved since 2009 is no accident. Specifically, it is statement that analysts believe Poland will outperform estimated economic fundamentals at issuance over a 10-year period.

Moreover, Polish spreads (+2.31) now trade above (price goes up yield comes down) below the fallen angels Spanish(+3.1) and Italian(+2.77). As the only yieldy rising stars they occupy a unique monopoly position and are in heavy demand.

There are many things a 16 year old cant do. They can't accrue debt, they can't buy alcohol, they can't buy large knives at a supermarket, they can't watch or make pornography, they can't buy cigarettes. 

They can get married or join the army at 16, but only with the written permission of their parents. The British army isn't in the business of deploying 16 year olds to war, and I don't believe it has done so since WWII.

Just because a 16/17 year old can do SOME of the things an adult can, doesn't make them an adult or capable of adult decisions.

Seriously, given current conditions (real interest rate below zero, nominal interest rate close to zero, inflation way below target), I see absolutely no reason why we could not run a, say 2% GDP budget deficit, use half of that for education, infrastructure and child care, and use the other half for stimulus in southern Europe (recently, the KfW lend a one billion Euros to their Spanish counterparts, to lend to businesses when the banks would not. We could, *and should* expand that drastically). This way, we even would bring down debt relative to GDP, just slower than with a balanced budget. We could even cut some of the stupid crap the current government does to finance this. Like paying people not to send their children to daycare, or the hotel subsidies...

Der Autor dieses Textes bekommt genau das, was er sich wünscht, heult aber rum, dass er eben nicht zu den priveligierten Eliten gehört, die von seiner herbeigewünschten und derzeit sich in vollem Gange befindlichen Entwicklung profitiert.

Zur Erklärung: 

Nationalstaaten sind eine der wichtigsten Errungenschaften der Menschheit, die Bollwerke, die ein friedliches Zusammenleben von einem Volk(zu beachten ist, ich spreche von einem(!) Volk, von Völkern spreche ich im nächsten Post) überhaupt erst möglich gemacht hat. Davor gab es Interessengruppen, die sich die hilflose, da nicht zusammengeschlossene oder organisierte Masse zu Opfern gemacht hat. Man führte Krieg, verlangte Abgaben, es gab Sklaverei, Fronendienste und Unterdrückung.

Der Nationalstaat beendete diese Praxis, denn er schuf aus den unterschiedlichsten Menschengruppen, eben den treckerfahrenden Oberammergauern und den ungebildeten Schreiberlingen die gerne zu einer Elite gehörten würden, eine Gemeinschaft, die sich auf Werte und Normen einigte, die das Leben aller im Einflussbereich der Gemeinschaft aufwertete. 

Der Bürger in diesem Nationalstaat bekam unveräußerliche Rechte, Freiheiten, aber auch Pflichten. Im Gegenzug war es der Staat, der ihn gegen Gefahren aus dem Inneren und Äußeren schützte, nährte und ihn nie, zumindest in der Theorie, in ein menschenunwürdiges Leben fallen ließ. Der Nationalstaat ist die Platform, von welcher der Bürger all seine Unternehmungen seines Lebens aus bestritt. Um diese Bildungslücke zu schließen, empfehle ich Hobbes *Leviathan* zu lesen.

Aber dank Personen wie diesem Autor, die sich eine faschistische Weltregierung mit weniger Demokratie wünschen, in der alle Menschen wieder Opfer von Interessengruppen werden, wurde das Prinzip des Nationalstaates ausgehölt und wieder einmal ist der Mensch anderen ausgeliefert. 

Der Autor merkt nicht einmal, dass er genau das bekommt, was er sich wünscht.

In Deutschland hat man keine Wahl mehr. Ein noch weniger an Demokratie würde unweigerlich in einer Diktatur münden. 
Die Volkskammer der DDR war nichteinmal derartig offensichtlich gesteuert, wie es der Bundestag heute ist, inklusive Scheinopposition.
In Deutschland wird seit Jahren versucht den Nationalstaat politisch aufzulösen, mit all den dazugehörigen Konsequenzen. Warum verarmen die Deutschen, obwohl sich ihr Reichtum mehrt? Warum entscheidet eine Lobbyorganisation(europäische Institutionen) was gut für die Deutschen ist? Wieso senken wir unsere Bildungsstandards um uns anderen anzugleichen? Warum treten unsere Arbeiter in Konkurrent mit Billigkräften aus dem Ausland? Wieso geben wir die Herrschaft über unseren Haushalt ab? Warum retten wir mit Geldern der öffentlichen Hand marodierende Privatunternehmen? Warum führen wir Kriege für wirtschaftliche Interessen?

Die Antwort ist simpel: Weil wir den Nationalstaat aufgegeben haben. Die Institution, die uns vor all dem schützen sollte, wurde in der naiven  Hoffnung auf die Welt, die sich der Autor so sehr wünscht, aufgegeben. Die Unterstützer dachten, dass sie am Ende auch zur Elite gehören. Geschah nur leider nicht. 

Und so sind wir heute wieder schutzlos anderen ausgeliefert, diesmal nicht marodierenden Banden, sondern den Konzernen, den Banken, Wirtschaftinteressen, Lobbygruppen. Teile der Bürgerschaft werden wieder, diesmal legal, versklavt, die Sozialsysteme weitestgehend abgeschafft, die Rechte und Freiheiten beschnitten und dem Bürger immer mehr Pflichten auferlegt.

Damit verschwindet erneut die Solidarität eines Volkes untereinander, was es unmöglich macht mit anderen solidarisch zu sein, der Bürger lebt schon längst wieder in sehr viel kleineren Gruppen und hat die Interessen anderer völlig ausgeblendet. Der Superreiche, der sein Leben lang ein Unternehmen aufbaute, schimpft auf den Neureichen, der durch Aktien zu Geld kam. Dieser schimpft auf die Oberschicht unter ihm, die andere Interessen vertritt als er. Diese wiederum bescheinigt der Mittelschicht faul und ungebildet zu sein und es sich in den Sozialsystemen bequem gemacht zu haben. Die Mittelschicht verabscheut den Auftstocker aus der Unterschicht während dieser über Hartz IV Empfänger herzieht. Es bilden sich wieder Gruppen, die gegeneinander arbeiten und verhindern, das irgendein Fortschritt für die Gesamtheit erzielt wird.

Wir entwickeln uns zurück. Die Demokratie wird weiter und weiter abgebaut zugunsten dieser Weltregierung, die der Autor am Ziel seiner Träume sieht. Nur wird dort eben nicht jeder zur Elite zählen wie er hofft, sondern sich gegenseitig behindern, wieder in Gruppen organisieren, wieder von vorn anfangen.

Und wo auch auf die Herkunft angespielt wurde, warum gibt es denn kein Multikulti? Warum existieren überall auf der Welt die selben Banlieues, ob es Afro-Amerikaner, Mohammedaner, Chinesen oder Mexikaner sind? 

Nicht weil die einheimische Bevölkerung rassisstisch wäre, sondern weil es in der Natur des Menschen liegt, sich mit seinen Gleichen abzugeben. In selbem Maße wie der Autor nichts findet, was ihn mit dem Herrn aus Oberammergau verbindet, findet einer der eben aufgezählten nichts, was ihn mit den Menschen in dem Land verbindet, in dem er sich aufhält. Er bleibt unter seinesgleichen, denn die sprechen wenigstens seine Sprache, er ist in der Lage zu kommunizieren, was elemnatar wichtig ist für menschliches Zusammenleben.

Es gründet sich also die Monokultur die eben genau die selben Dinge fordert, die ein Nationalstaat, der Nationalstaat der jeweiligen Gruppe, ihnen bereitzustellen verpflichtet ist. Diese Gruppen wollen wie jeder andere Mensch auch Schutz, Garantien, Rechte, Freiheiten. 

Warum gibt es denn überall Unabhängigkeitsbewegungen? Warum wollen beispielsweise die Kurden ihren eigenen Staat? Weil er ihrer Gruppe all das bieten würde. Deshalb gibt es Nationalstaaten, deshalb sind sie eklatant wichtig! Deshalb sollten sich Menschen wie der Autor schämen diese so niederzuschreiben, aus purem Unverstand der Implikationen die eine solche Entwicklung mit sich bringt. 

Das Auflösen der Nationalstaaten, die Entdemokratisierung dieser ist in vollem Gange. Wir alle verlieren. Wenn es irgendwann nur noch ein Europa gibt, dann finden wir uns in einer Quasidiktatur wieder, in welcher wir uns nur noch mit denen abgeben werden, denen wir trauen. Menschen aus unserem Dorf, unserer Stadt. Der Ausländer ist uns dann völlig suspekt, wir werden uns entsolidarisiert haben und uns wieder abschotten. Ein Rückfall in dunkelste Zeiten, die das Schaffen des Nationalstaates beendete.

Eine Umkehr ist unter den derzeit herrschenden politischen Gegebenheiten unmöglich. Keiner wird hier ein Mehr an Demokratie wagen, welches nötig wäre, diese Entwicklung rückgängig zu machen. Das Volk abstimmen lassen, über Europa, Bankenrettung, Euro. Undenkbar.

Banks promise high interest rates to attrack people, even if that risk is irresponsible. People look at interest rates - the higher the better - without evaluating the bank's policy if their money is guaranteed.

&gt;That will most likely lead to people avoiding using euro as a currency for saving. 

Most people in Europe do not have 100 000 € in savings anyway.

&gt;To actually punish the ones that own the bank, well.. it's also a bit of a double edged sword. What will happen is they force the bank to be more restrictive and careful. Which in turn leads to higher rents, loans harder to get, intra-bank lending higher rents, less liquidity in the market and probably even less investment into companies aswell.

That's okay, because the alternative is either a collapsing financial system, which means even less liquidity, or bailout by the state.

true,stDemigod,null,null,"Bevor man mir nun vorwirft ausschließlich auf deutsche Interessen zu schielen, möchte ich auf die Bedeutung von Nationalstaaten im globalen Zusammenhang eingehen. 

Die Geschichte der Menschheit ist geprägt davon, dass der Starke über den Schwachen herfällt. So war es immer, so wird es immer bleiben, es liegt in der Natur des Menschen, insbesondere wenn er solche Entscheidungen in einem undemokratischen Prozess trifft. In Deutschland lehnen schwankend zwischen 79% und 86% der Menschen den Krieg in Afghanistan ab. Trotzdem wird er, dank des Demokratiedefizites, dass eine repräsentative Demokratie mit sich bringt, geführt. 

Das einzige bisher wirksame Mittel einen Krieg zu verhindern waren und sind starke demokratische Nationalstaaten. Deutschland, Frankreich und Großbritannien waren dafür einst leuchtende Beispiele. Keiner käme dort heute auf die Idee, den anderen zu überfallen, zu gleich sind die Prozesse in den Ländern, zu stark noch die Staaten. Ein Volk, welches patriotisch hinter seinem Staat steht lässt sich nicht besiegen, nicht unterdrücken. Die Amerikaner lernen das jedes Jahrzehnt aufs Neue.

Starke Nationalstaaten verhindern Kriege. Man nehme an, die arabische Welt wäre dadurch gekennzeichnet, es gebe dort keine Möglichkeit für Aggressoren wie Israel andere Länder zu okkupieren, es wäre schlicht unmöglich. Um genau das zu verhindern, um einfluss nach dem Credo ""Teile und herrsche"" zu verhindern, sorgt man durch Unterstützung von Seperatisten, Fundamentalisten und Terroristen dafür, dass diese Staaten ständig destabilisiert und damit in einer schwachen Position gehalten werden.

Dies ist natürlich nicht nur militärisch, sondern auch wirtschaftlich möglich und wurde und wird auch heutzutage noch als Hauptdruckmittel eingesetzt. Man schaue nur nach Afrika, wo die Entwicklungshilfe effektiv verhindert, dass sich Staaten dort wirtschaftlich entwickeln und Kontrolle über die eigenen Ressourcen bekommen. Handelsabkommen sorgen dafür, dass die Wirtschaft eines Nationalstaates nicht durch Zölle vor billigen Erzeugnissen anderer Nationen geschützt werden kann. So werden ganze Völker durch wirtschaftliche Prozesse unterjocht, dies ist auch der Grund für unsere derzeitige Krise. Länder wie Griechenland können nicht abwerten, Zölle für ausländische Waren erheben, sich gegen die wirtschaftliche Dominanz der Deutschen wehren, weil sie diesen Teil ihrer Rechte als Nationalstaat aufgegeben haben, als sie der EU beitraten und den Euro einführten. 

So führt das Abschaffen der Nationalstaaten zu Armut und darüber hinaus wieder zu schwachen Ländern, die offen sind für Invasionen von Aggressionen. 

Weltweit funktioniert es nach diesem Prinzip. Ob in Südamerika, Afrika oder Asien. Nur dort, wo in etwa gleich starke Nationalstaaten nebeneinander existieren, kommt es nicht zu den beschriebenen Effekten. Westeuropa, Nordamerika, Nordostasien.

Die Vision der eine Welt Regierung, in der alle Völker gleich sind, öffnet Tür und Tor für Willkür, Tyrannei, Armut und Krieg. Eine Welt in der alle einander schutzlos ausgeliefert sind. Das ist der naive Wunsch so vieler Befürworter idiologisch verblendeter Anhänger solcher Ideen.

Eine Welt, in der die Menschen gleichwertig behandelt werden, kann nur funktionieren wenn jeder aus eine Staat kommt, den man aufgrund seiner Stärke respektiert. Damit ist nicht nur die militärische gemeint. 
Jeder, der mal im nicht westlichen Ausland war, weiß wie es ist, als Deutscher vorgestellt zu werden, dem automatisch alle Attribute angedichtet werden, die man aus Büchern oder Vorurteilen über die Deutschen im Ausland kennt. Funktioniert das, wenn sich ein Palästinenser in Deutschland vorstellt? Oder ein Afrikaner? So so, Nigeria, was bringen sie denn mit, außer Kenntnissen in Korruption?

Erst wenn Menschen sich als gleichwertig wahrnehmen, weil sie sich beide auf einen gleich starken Hintergrund berufen können, sind sie in der Lage sich auf Augenhöhe zu begegnen. Dann funktioniert auch das Zusammenleben problemlos.

Mit anderen Worten: Starke Nationalstaaten würden mehr für das friedliche Zusammenleben aller Völker tun, als die eine Welt Regierung.",0,1372407264,null,0,false,0,carv9yz,t3_1h7dde,t1_carv9yz,t1_caruzbk,null,1430655069,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

Sometimes the situation is so bad that it's worth reevaluating common dogma which may be true in general but not in this unusual situation. Is the European framework helping more than hurting?

Go on, then. When it comes to elections, Scotland never votes Tory. Scotland leaving will increase the percentage of votes Tories get as a result.

If you have more savings, you benefit more from the state guarantees on saving accounts. It's normal that you contribute more to the funds needed to guarantee that money.

It is called [Capital adequacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_adequacy)  and probably some other things and is amongst other things requlated by a rule set called BASEL (1,2 and in the future 3).

Banks do basically NOT work like you think they do. They are extremely advanced beasts and they do some seriously murky shit you either don't want to know about or do know about. I'm not a economist so I'm not trying to say I do either, but the more I learn, the creepier it is.

Basically, banks is the nations way of regulating the flow of money in a market. Banks might be private, but they are very very dependent on the state. Which is why governments are weary of letting them fail.

Pushing this risk on to investors (in this case the people that own the bank not necessarily the depositors), is to put it mildly a game changer.

You should also factor in the little fact that since banks are private, you would as a investor of a bank, EXPECT to be liable for your own investment, right? Well, history has told us that banks in the EU has been saved by governments many times unlike a regular company. 

This has of course driven down the risk premium involved with buying stock in a bank .. which in turn makes them, ahem, more risk prone.

But Cameron was able to find something that he didn't approve of. In addition to the budget, the EU also recently reached agreement on a reform to the bloc's agricultural budget and subsidies, a deal which changed the system of calculation used to determine the British rebate, negotiated by Margaret Thatcher in 1984.

Perhaps it even is a 1st world problem, if you dare to point out negative things about Denmark. If we stay objective, I can though point some things out that is less than wonderful for me:

""Jante loven"". It more or less implies that you should be a little ashamed of success, and certainly not brag about it. This means many people actually admire a hard working garbage man more, than the successful business man. Hard to explain, but deeply integrated in the Danish culture. Good for people in the bottom of the food chain, but I guess it can be tiring for people that feel no appreciation from others of their success.

Incredibly expensive cars. We plan to buy a MINI Clubman Cooper, which is about 10.500 € used in Germany. In Denmark the same car would cost approx. 25.000 €.

Bad weather. Grey, windy and lots of rain. Not much explanation needed here. ;-)

Privacy is valued very high - although this also brings a lot of tolerance. But this also means that many Danes does not come to you, if you are a stranger. They wait for you to come to them, to respect your privacy. This also mean that it often is dead silent in public transportation, although the bus is full of people. Foreigners often mistake this for being arrogance, which it also is, to some extent.

Most people know Nürnberg for its Nazi history and the trails (the court room can be visited), but it also has a great history, it became a very rich city in the medival times because the trade route to italy passed by.

* [Castle of Nürnberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) : From there you have a nice view overlooking the city, and it is one of the most important castles in europe because of it's history.

* The market with its golden fountain (Schöner Brunnen) and it's Weihnachtsmarkt (in the weeks before christmas)

* [Nazi party rally grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party_rally_grounds): Well, the title tells it. Adolf Hitler built a large rally ground there and you can still see the remains and visit a museum that will give you an insight on the cruelties and his insane mind.

* [Felsengänge Nürnberg](http://www.felsengaenge-nuernberg.de/en/our-organisation.html) (They forgot to translate the text on the frontpage, but the rest should be fine) are tunnels and bunkers, storages etc. under the whole city. Some are from the 14th century and were used as storages to keep the beer cool. During WWII, many of them under the old city centre and the castle got connected and were used as bunkers and there were plans to install factories there, too. There were a ton of art stored in these bunkers during WWII. There is also an Bunker under the train station from the cold war era. One of my special recommendations!

* In the [Handwerkerhof](http://www.handwerkerhof.de/en/home.html) you can see how craftsmen create tradtitional products from the area in an medivial environment.

* Nürnberg is also home of [Albrecht Dürer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrect_Durer), one of the most important painter/mathmatican/... of medival europe, you can visit his house and see some of his art in the 

* [Germanisches Nationalmuseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum): Well the largest museum of german history &amp;amp; culture. It's very interesting, you can see there works from great german artists, but also medivial weapons &amp;amp; armors, other technical stuff, etc.

* [Neues Museum Nürnberg](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neues_Museum_N%C3%BCrnberg) has a great collection of modern and contemporary art and design, for example Andy Warhol.

* [Peter Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Henlein), one of the first people who built pocketwatches 

* [Lebkuchen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebkuchen) is also a franconian/nuremburg thing

* In the time before christmas: Christkildemarkt + Glühwein!

* Nürnberg has a soccer team and a icehockey team in the highest german leagues, also.

* ADIDAS and PUMA have their headquarters and big outlet shopping centres in the small town of Herzogenaurach, 25km north-west of Nuremberg. If you want to go shopping for cheap sportswear (and more), you should consider a visit. Also if you are interested in [modern](http://www.vb.com/puma/puma-hq-herzogenaurach-m.jpg) [architecture](http://www.herzogenaurach.de/typo3temp/pics/e9cc906d7d.jpg).

**Bamberg:**

* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique euopean medivial town centre. Actually the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  

* The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope noth of the alps.

* Right next to the Cathedral, there is the [""Alte Hofhaltung""](http://www.emiksch.de/Lions/2007/Bilder/slides/Bamberg_Alte_Hofhaltung.jpg) where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers (from 2011, with orlando bloom etc.)

* The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""

* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above

* You get the best [view over the whole city](http://home.arcor.de/pahaschi/Bamberg/Blick_auf_Bamberg.jpg) from the terraces of [Michelsberg Abbey](http://www.travelwriter.at/pic/049/bamberg-kloster-michaelsberg-020331g.jpg) (Kolster Michelsberg), and former Abbey, where you find a nice restaurant/cafe today. There is also the [franconian brewery museum](http://www.brauereimuseum.de/) there.

* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) had his regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed away in 2006. He was leading the plot to kill Hitler.

* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;num=1&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18) as you'll have a [superb view over Bamberg](http://www.spezial-keller.de/index_files/stacks_image_44.jpg) and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)  If you want to do it local style, bring your own food and only buy the beer there. **I would not recommend this in the winter, quite cold outside**
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food like Bratwurst, Schäuferla (my recommendation, try it at least once!!!) or Schweinebraten.

* Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;amp;num=30&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;gl=de&amp;amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=17), or the [Spezi Rauchbier](https://maps.google.de/maps?q=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.896912,10.893111&amp;amp;spn=0.001994,0.005284&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;hq=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;radius=15000&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18). Right there you will also find the Fässla, where you can enjoy some great beer too.
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right you can enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg. You will find there many US citizens, as Bamberg has the Warner Barracks with over 3000 soldiers.

* Bamberg has a Baskteball team in the highest german league.  It's the dominating team of the last years and also playing in the european league. 

* Bamberg is a University Town with currently about 12k Students (at 70k people), so you'll find young people everywhere.

Also, on your trip from Nuremberg to Bamberg, you will pass Buttenheim, the birthplace of **[Levi Strauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Strauss)**, inventor of the famous [LEVI Jeans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Levi%27s_506_back_pocket.jpg) where you can visit a museum. There are also two good breweries where you can eat really good too. I would recommend ""Schäuferla"" :)

**Würzburg:**

* [Würzburger Residenz](http://www.grand-i-tour.de/de/images/git_wuerzburgresi13.jpg) Also some scenes from the three musketeers were shot here

* [Feste Marienburg](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Festung-Marienberg_1409_10_11.jpg)
Würzburg is in the centre of [franconian wine region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconia_%28wine_region%29), which is known for its [Bocksbeutel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bocksbeutel.jpg)

* Würzburg has a Basketball team in the highest german league.

* The University of Würzburg has about 25k students enrolled, the city if full of them ;)

**Bayreuth:** 

* [The Opara House is Unesco world heritage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margravial_Opera_House)(also change to german version to see the asonishing inside of the opera house) and it's the city of Wagner (Ride of the Valkyries)

* [The Eremitage](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eremitage_%28Bayreuth%29) wiki only in german, but the pictures are what you are going to see

* Bayreuth has a Basketball team in the highest german league. As you see, franconia is quite strong in german basketball with 3 teams.

**Franconian Switzerland / Little Switzerland**

Also, franconia is relatively cheap to live (0,5 litre of beer: beginning at 1,50€), and the [franconian switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconian_Switzerland) is one of the oldest touristic regions in germany. It's famous for its beer, its bakeries and 
butchers. It is also called land of the castles sometimes, as there are very many of them. 
You can discover it best by car, but there are is a list of [bus lines](http://vgn.de/freizeitlinien/) (german link) that are esp. for recreational/free time destinations like wildlife parks or hiking from may 1st till november. Click ""herunterladen (PDF)"" to download a pdf with a map and images to see what to expect and maybe use google translate (google translate did not work on the homepage when I tried it, so i recommend the pdf ""workaround""). Here is a [map of the region with public transport lines](http://www.vgn.de/ib/site/documents/media/f387bb36-6624-65dd-c17b-5cde6c7b84f4.jpg/VG_Freizeit_Prospekt.jpg) that are interesting for tourists, green are regular routes, purple routes are weekend and holiday only and only in the summer while orange are weekend only during the whole year. If you need help to find the right trip, message me and I'll translate and help you to find the busses etc.

* [Aufseß](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufse%C3%9F) is the village with the highest density of breweries in the world, there are 4 breweries for only 1351 people.
Also the founder of the german national museum in Nuremberg, Hans von und zu Aufseß, Knight of the Empire and his family had (and still have) their castle (well, actually two castles) there and live there. 

* [Sanspareil](http://www.bayreuth-wilhelmine.de/bilder/sanspareil/felsentheater480.jpg) is a Park created by Wilhelmine von Bayreuth, the sister of Frederick the great. You'll find the [Morgenländischer Bau](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanspareil_-_Morgenl%C3%A4ndischer_Bau.jpg) there and the [castle of the village](http://www.wonsees.de/geschichte/Sanspareil850J/Bilder/Burg_Zwernitz.jpg) is nice, too.

* The Wiesenttal (Valley of the river Wiesent) is very nice too, you'll find some [ruins of castles](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Burgruine_Neideck_05112008.JPG) and scenic rocks there, and it's right next to the autobahn from Nuremberg to Bamberg.

* At the entrance to the Wiesenttal you'll find the [Walberla](http://www.walberla.de/uploads/images/walberla-niedlingi.jpg) (or Ehrenbürg) hill, which is one of the most important hills in the area. First settlements on the hill date back till the stone age, and you can still see remains of the wall which surrounded the whole plateau from about 500 B.C.


**Traditional Food** you can expect in the region:
Aside from the famous [Nürnberger](http://www.nuernberger-bratwuerste.de/images/bilder/Gerichte_Feuer/46Bratwurst_20110812_437_kleiner_6%20mit%20Kraut.jpg), you should try [Fränkisches Schäuferla](http://www.frankenalb.de/uploads/pics/schaeufele_008_01.jpg) or [Saure Zipfel](http://www.antenne.de/cf/services/img/ccadd//470xx/4112797.jpg). [Spargel](http://www.spargel.net/images/spargel-mit-schinken.jpg) is also very common here. [Fränkischer Sauerbraten](http://autoimg.kochbar.de/kbrezept/45625_17700/400x266/rezept-sauerbraten-mit-lebkuchensosse-bild-nr-7.jpg) is a speciality, as there is gingerbread in the sauce. [Krenfleisch](http://www.genussregion.oberfranken.de/images_gen/spezialitaeten_bilder/716_big.jpg) has a sauce of horseradish. As side dishes, [Wirsing / Savoy cabbage](http://www.das-sonnenkorn.de/assets/images/wirsing.jpg), [Sauerkraut](http://www.marions-kochbuch.de/rezept/0283.jpg) or [Blaukraut](http://www.kostenlose-rezepte.eu/upload/Blaukraut-657.jpg) are the way to go next to the mandatory Kloß / Knödel which are either [Kartoffelklöße/knödel](http://bavariaundercover.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/kloss.jpg) (made of potatoes) or [Semmelkloß/knödel](http://www.essen-und-trinken.de/uploads/thumbnails/0009/00000000009/1024x1024/FeineSemmelknoedel_4f5e90da3a46fd18d55c0d07f683cbba_fjt2009040391.jpg)(made of bread rolls). As a dessert, you should try [Knieküchle](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/K%C3%BCchla.JPG).

As drinks, try one of the [franconian white wines](http://www.bad-boys-on-tour.de/sommerhausen/bilder/bocksbeutel.jpg) in their characteristic bottles or one of the countless beers of the [region with the highest density of breweries in the world](http://www.franken-sind-keine-baiern.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Deutschland_Bier_Nebenkarte.jpg)

**Breweries I would recommend, although all are great:**

* Brauerei Wagner in Merkendorf
* Brauerei Goldener Löwe in Buttenheim (where the Levi Strauss museum is)
* Schlenkerla in Bamberg (The Rauchbier - that means Smoked beer- is a famous speciality, tastes like bacon) 
* Fässla in Bamberg
* Grasser in Huppendorf
* Klosterbrauerei in Weissenohe (founded 1050, one of the oldest breweries in germany, great food also!)

(Typical beer types in the region are ""helles"" and ""dunkles"", but also ""Märzen"" or ""Bockbier"") 

**Some Festivals in the Region:**

* [Sandkirchweih Bamberg](http://www.sandkerwa.de/startseite/) 22.-26. August

* [Samba Festival Coburg](http://www.samba-festival.de/) 12.-14. July

* [Africa Festical Würzburg ](http://www.africafestival.org/)  30. May - 2. June

Économiquement, on a les problèmes suivants :

3. Pas de ressources naturelles
4. Possibilités d'exportations à forte valeur ajoutée limitées
5. Dépendance aux importations
6. Coûts de transports élevés
7. Probabilité élevée de catastrophes naturelles

Ceci est commun à toute la Caraïbe. Je ne vois pas ce que la France peut faire pour résoudre cela.

Bref, on peut améliorer la situation de manière marginale, mais les difficultés resteront car les contraintes sont avant tout géographiques, démographiques, technologiques, énergétiques, et environnementales. À cela s'ajoutent des contraintes culturelles, avec un manque de formation et une vulnérabilité aux réseaux mafieux de la drogue.

Yeah print themselves out of it. Which would cause so much inflation in cyprus' case that they would bankrupt everyone else and the country would collapse anyway. But we still do it to a limited degree with bce bail outs.

&gt; Maybe take control of the worst offending banks and use them to fund the industry as they should.

That what they mostly did by merging and nationalizing and reinvesting the money.

&gt;  Is the European framework helping more than hurting?

Actually i believe Cyprus did id to themselves because they invested everything they had in money laundering. Not the best idea around.

Greece had a serious industry and still has it, the gov was just atrocely corrupt. Once the house is cleaned it'll build back, i hope. 

As for spain they invested a ton (way too much) in buildings and land. When the bubble collapsed the country got the wind knocked out of them too. But i think it's more of a matter to find them something else to do with all that manpower. Same for greece.

Deep down the european framework ain't the issue. The issue is the bad habit of investing down everything on one thing, try to cut the corner on the welfare system like *all the time* (and it *always* bites us back but we never learn. People ain't never revolting when they are safe at home and can pay the bills), and rampant corruption to some degree. Oh and debt-based economy/budgets at a loss. Fixing all those points could probably help way more than leaving europe would ever. 

&gt;  Is a government always incapable of regulating the money supply without creating inflation?

Bailing out with printing money only work to some degree. You can't do it *perpetually* or the inflation will bite you back and you won't have any control on that one (except by rising tax on the wealthiest and sinking their money, but since they are frequently in power and well connected they'll fight you back dirty and hide it away).

&gt;  Is it worth impoverishing a majority of the population to bail out a minority of stakeholders?

Bailing out the banks then forcing the welfare system down their throats, high tax on the richs, and stopping rampant corruption would probably help a lot, imho, as of right now. See that unemployment causing unhappiness in athens because no one has any money ? Force the banks/greek gov to toss the some. And then some more. Yep, directly, through welfare or unconditionnal income.

Per definizione la difesa subentra quando non hai altre scelte. Tipo se puoi scappare, scappa. Se puoi dargli il portafoglio daglielo. Se hai la pistola e l'altro e' lontano magari prima spara in aria. etc etc

Se invece ti ritrovi spalle al muro e senza via di fuga o se devi aiutare uno palesemente senza via di fuga allora subentra la difesa.

I link li ho messi solo per far vedere che alla fine un giudice si trova una persona davanti, senza testimoni che dice che ha ucciso l'altra persona per difesa. La prima cosa che fa e' probabilmente accertarsi se c'erano altre soluzioni.

Altrimenti diventa un far west. 

Poi cio' non significa che sarebbe quello che farei io. Se trovo uno in casa prima lo bastono, se posso colpendolo alle spalle senza che lui se ne accorga. Pero' non so se sarei in linea di principio favorevole ad una diffusione delle armi come in murica

It is called Capital adequacy and probably some other things and is amongst other things requlated by a rule set called BASEL (1,2 and in the future 3).

Of course. Banks in principle receive deposits in exchange for rent, that they loan out in exchange for rent, and live off the difference. That has evolved to loaning out more than they have in deposits (to a ridiculous extent), but the basic principle still is the same. So they still need to have deposits or invested capital to be able to loan out.

&gt;Basically, banks is the nations way of regulating the flow of money in a market.

Yes. And that's an essential function of public interest.

&gt;Pushing this risk on to investors (in this case the people that own the bank not necessarily the depositors), is to put it mildly a game changer.

They're taking the risk of gaining profit, so they should take the risk of bearing loss too.

&gt;This has of course driven down the risk premium involved with buying stock in a bank .. which in turn makes them, ahem, more risk prone.

Of course, so now you alleviate that by making sure that not the state, but the banks themselves have to cough up the costs of the risks they take.

Et de même la méconnaissance profonde des ordres de grandeur de densité me sidère : La France métropolitaine est le territoire le moins densément peuplé de l'UE ( au grand dam des démographes qui s'en lamentent depuis deux siècles ) si on compare avec quelques pays sans trop de problèmes socio-économiques comme les Pays-Bas on s'aperçoit qu'ils ont des densités comparables aux îles antillaises.

true,mejillonius,null,null,"just a few advices from a local:

may seem a bit apocalyptic but better safe than sorry

carry the minimum posible cash with you, everywhere accepts visa, mastercard, and all major credit cards, and here presenting your id with any card is a must, so if you are pickpocketed the bad guys will have more trouble to steal your money.

whenever you are in a crowd or a very touristic place put your handbags in your front and never on your side or your rear, and keep your handbag's zip closed, most of the pickpocketers walk really close to you, slip their hands in your bag, and pick your wallet, thats how they operate.

leave all your documentation on your hotel (or where you stay) and carry a photocopy, it is still valid and if you are pickpocketed you won't be undocumented.

when you go out at partynever drink too much or sleep on the subway/street i've seen too much times people get robbed just because they passed away going home from party

apart from that and the other advices from this post i can't remember anything special.

just take this note, pickpoketing is fairly common but not voilent, as they take adventage of tourist dismissals. 
just a fact, if the stolen property is less than 400€ AND they don't use violence it is not a ""crime"" it is a ""fault"" (i hope my translator doesn't mess this up) and pickpocketers will get away with. not long time ago on the news i saw the other day one pickpoketer that bragged about his 3000 dettentions...
our law is a crap, i know....
however if they use violence or pickpocket something too expensive (an iphone, a cool camera, or something like that) it is a crime, pursued and punished with jail...
so they wont go for anything too expensive.

about the language: it doesn't matter, as i told you you'll never have the chance to speak to your pickpocketer. but it can help you on your trip a lot, barcelona is a touristic city and most of the places that any tourist visit and the sorroundings speak english on any degree, but aside from that the city speaks spanish, so if you go to a market, the vendors rarely will speak english, for example...

Personalmente sono bivalente sul tema del porto d'armi facile; comprendo il forte bisogno umano a sentirsi difesi, ed essendo cresciuto in ambienti insalubr so anche che a volte vorresti avere un attrezzo che ti rimette in gioco; perchè se una mucca di duecento chili per due metri ti viene contro con una bottiglia rotta, non importa quanto kung fu conosci, perchè ti pacca in due.

Capisco anche però dall'altro lato chi dice ""eeh ma se uno sbrocca colla pistola"" ""ma se uno poi svuota il caricatore"". Capisco e son d'accordo. La soluzione di affidare l'armi solo a chi dimostra di saperle usare e di avere la stabilità mentale per adoperarle  ottima.

Però c'è anche da capire che siamo esseri umani, e a meno che non stiamo parlando di gente che quiotidianamente ha a che fare con situazioni pericolose, non si può pretendere che il ragionier Bartezzaghi prenda il porto e, una volta minacciato da un malintenzionato armato di cacciavite/coltello/catena che gli dice ""dammi le chiavi della macchena, dammi i soldi, dammi il culo"" non risponda con impeto.

Sulla carta dice, tiri fuori la pistola e gli spari un colpo, lo disabiliti e poi la metti via.

Sulla strada tiri fuori la pistola, spari due colpi (perchè double tap, come diceva MechanicalMind) e poi aspetti di vedere che succede; Ma se hai il cervello ubriaco di adrenalina è più facile che gli spari due colpi, lo tieni sotto tiro e gli calci un calcio perchè vaffanculo stronzo. E' facile anche che sei terrorizzato e premi il grilletto per un tot.

Ingiusto? forse. Ma la responsabilità è di suo figlio che ha deciso che la soluzione ai suoi problemi era armarsi di taglierino e taglierineggiare la gente"".

Voilà ce que j'ai écrit. Les pays qui réussissent le mieux dans la Caraïbe sont des places financières off-shore. Suite à ta remarque, je retire l'agriculture.

&gt;Déjà prendre en compte les spécificités régionales : privilégier le français dans une zone qui ne le parle pas est aberrant et accentue l'effet ""frontière"" et donc la dépendance à la métropole.

Oui, c'est vrai, mais c'est l'article 2 de la Constitution. Parler anglais pour développer le tourisme doit être la priorité n°2, la première, c'est l'autonomie.

&gt;J'entends très fort le ""on s'en fout"" ou ""c'est pas notre problème"" qui suinte du message.

Pas du tout, j'ai vécu là-bas, plusieurs années et parmi les plus belles de ma vie, et j'y suis attaché. C'est justement pour cela que je ne souhaite pas un développement comme les îles voisines (pauvreté ou paradis fiscal), ni comme la métropole (c'est impossible). Au contraire, autonomie énergétique et alimentaire plutôt que dépendance au pétrole et à la métropole.

Non, d'ailleurs je ne le dis pas. C'est principalement un problème de transports : 71% (dont 47% liés aux transports routiers) de la dépense énergétique régionale et 53% des émissions de gaz à effet de serre pour la Martinique.

I fly into Barcelona Airport about 10 times a year.  It's a fairly fast airport, so if all goes well and you land at 16:05, add a little taxiing and a short wait on your baggage.  You *should* be out at 16:35.  If you land at T1, we'll add about a 5 minute wait for the bus to T2 and 10 minutes for the ride.  Then another 5 to get a ticket and find your way, so it's 16:55.  Wait on the train, because on weekdays (since you don't give a lot of info that my best guess, chance of 5 our of 7) it leaves for Sants at 17:08.  Arrive at Sants 17:27.
Buy tickets, find your train, be ready an hour early.

For a LAST train to anywhere, that is not a lot of spare time.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yes and no. From your post i undrstand you were against the bailout. That's where i disagree. The bailout is as necessary as the welfae imho. Both were probably needed here. 

Now the part where i agree with you is that broke taxpayers should not bear the brunt of it. Which is why i agree for example with the cyprus model because they went only for people above 100k and only a %age. Because it was a one of time tax upon the rich and wealthy who can and should pay about all the taxes.

In essence cyprus paid it's employees and economy with the rich citizen and investors money. And the rest of europe will come back later for the debts to leave them more time and not strangle them (because they would go back to pillage the poor to pay for it too if we pushed he issue, which would be *bad* when it means essentially almost starving to death the whole country).

Printing money is also used to some degree, but the massive debts occident drag can't be entirely paid by it or it would cause so much inflation it'd ruin just as much everyone who'se not a millionaire. So we do it somewhate but sink it back when possible (loan we sometimes restructure) but do have to look for other solutions in the mean time. 

We also need to avoid printing endlessly oyherwise they'll just spend infinitely without never bothering to equilibrate anything and always beg for more money. The ''pay back the loan part'' being designed to pressure them to clean their policies more than real immediate economic needs on the spot. 

Which is why we dragged a little the greek gov and fired half of them even if it was a little ingerence. We'll bail them out but it's not a pass to be braindead fuckers.

Now the remaining part where we will have to do interventionism will be fighting corruption, fraud or otherwise semi legal evasion loopholes, abusive risk taking from funds, monopomy abuse (microsoft, mosanto and oil companies, i'm looking at you...) and otherwise the temptation to just steal all the system money like those two irish fuckers we'll hang dry.

Typed on a phone during a long boring travel so apologies for the typos, and i hope i'm clear on my core idea : we have to help but it's a difficult balance between helping them back on their feets or a free hand out; political interventionism or outright ingerence or doing nothing and watching them collapse; paying back debts, earning wide trust from other country and investors or starve the system like we are currently doing too (because those with the most money are generally gredy nowadays, and well connected, so they'll try to weasel out of it and rise taxes on the poor or cut welfare to pay their own debts. Think of the US republicans, who really are just all corporate overlords billionaires like romney, buying power and making legal a
to buy some more to buy the economy and foreign trust and therefore *all* the money for themselves and themselves alone, on the blood of everyone else.); not make fortunez run away but make them contribute the most possible without neither persecuting the really succesful who ain't just gready.

And we need to find a way to recover those 100 missing trillion sinked away from the economy in islands. Use some of it to pay the welfare system and pay back loans (destroy) the rest to stop inflation. Which means rebuilding a real welfare and break megacorporatism (wich always go back to the gets all the money scheme when you look away five fucking minutes) and their stranglehold without destroying the economy they hold hostage (destroying us will destroy all the jobs ! Like the one they already destroy while taking record profit except ten times faster).

Etc etc

[edit] Oh, what the heck, might as well explain the steps you should take to you:


The letter you received should include a declaration to cease and desist. DON'T SIGN THIS! Instead, look at the link above for a modified version of this, where you insert the information applicable to you.

You MUST send such a declaration under any circumstances, whether you are willing to pay or not.

Now you have two options: pay or don't pay. If you pay, everything is over. Nobody will bother you over this file again (unless, of course, you torrent it again).

If you don't want to pay, send a written declaration alongside your declaration to cease and desist, where you declare your point of view on the matter: not willing to pay, maybe you were not in your home during the torrenting (wouldn't hold in front of a court, but hey, that's not the matter here), maybe your (not necessarily) bad financial situation. Everything which tells the opposing side: I have no money and a lawsuit will be tedious (read: not economical for us).

Once you send this, the lawyers WILL send you more letters, demanding payment, quoting precedence lawsuits, etc. etc. - but this doesn't mean shit. You should save those letters, of course, but you are not required to pay them - yet.

They might send a collection agency (German: Inkasso) after you - if that happens, the Inkasso will sometime send you a ""Mahnbescheid"". It is important to contradict this Mahnbescheid! If you don't, the Inkasso is legally allowed to collect the money from you. If you do contradict it, however, they must start a lawsuit against you to collect the money.

Your strategy, if you don't pay, is: gamble that they won't start a lawsuit against you. From the 200.000 cease and desists in 2009, only 300-ish lawsuits were started. I don't know, if you are an easier target for those lawyers, because you are an American - could be, could not be, who knows.

Of course, you can always hire a lawyer, but in my opinion, you hardly save money this way (if any at all).",0,1372436598,null,0,1372437894,0,cas1l3d,t3_1h91lw,t1_cas1l3d,t3_1h91lw,null,1430652096,6,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,6

I live in Karlsruhe! I can show/tell you some ""must-see"" places.
Feel free to ask anything!

Look forward to one of the warmest cities in Germany ;)

A few tips:

1. Buy yourself a bicycle, Karlsruhe has no hills :) You can get cheep used bikes at : http://kleinanzeigen.ebay.de/ or http://www.quoka.de/

2. The public transport (s-bahn: kvv.de) is excelent, a monthly ticket may be good for you.

3. Internet: If you want german TV, check out KabelBW.de, they have 3play (TV,phone, internet). If not try o2 (o2online.de), they offer discounts when you get a mobile contract as well.

4. Bank: I would recommend postbank.de, they are cheap and have branches all over germany

5. Gym: http://venicebeach.pfitzenmeier.de/lifestyle-fitness/karlsruhe.html

I don't think having a hugely noticeable effect is important. If the effect is minor but present, it is a good effect.

I think the idea of bigger is better is fairly true in terms of the common market and free movement of people, ect because, well, if you have more people to sell to then every one benefits because there's more more competition and greater potential for companies to expand more easily. 

I'm less sure in terms of the political side of the EU. The point about trying to end war in Europe is probably the best reason for pushing forward with enlargement within the Balkans. However, behind the Common Market and ending war, I can't think of another good reason. 

However, do you really need another reason? Ending war and getting a  bigger Common Market is probably good enough to expand further into the Balkans, right?

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"Well generally a lot of the cooperation is useful for a whole load of countries to be involved in, not just one or two, so a lot of different countries might as well all adopt the same thing *together*. Having some sort of union doesn't really make sense when you're just talking about *one* piece of cooperation between two states, but when you start talking about *multiple* pieces of cooperation between *multiple* states you start having the need for a bit of over head planning and intergovernmentalism. And that level of cooperation between so many people is expensive because you have to make all the rooms to have discussions in, you have to pay for all the lawyers and the civil servants and the all the various advisers and the translators, it starts to add up. 

However, what I'm describing here is not the EU. But this *was* the EU way back in time. The thing is, European governments started cooperating so much that it became a much more important part of government than a simple cooperation tool. And when a supranational organisation starts having that much power, it starts needing a bit of democracy and then suddenly you have the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. Which costs more, but is also vital. Because you can't have some supranational entity without democracy. Would you like us to take away that democracy to cut the costs? Or would you like us to stop cooperating on such a large scale and then have a bunch of poorly made little groups of countries cooperating with each other with different systems which are completely incompatible between the different little groups of countries and are much less effective than if they were done on an EU level. And then you'd end up with the problem of democracy anyway because all these little groups would end up cooperating so much, that they need supranational entities to help oversee them and then that suprnational entity needs democracy and then you have loads of little inneficient European Unions scattered around the continent not doing as much good as one big European Union.

Yeah, two little countries by themselves can cooperate, and I encourage them to. But there's usually more benefits if they cooperate on a much larger scale and on a much larger range of issues. Do you know what organisation is perfect for that sort of cooperation? The European Union, of course. 

The EU has a ton of problems and I could criticise it all day for it's poor handling of crises, it's democratic deficit, its over paid employees, the way it wastes money, the corruption, the way it's easily corruptible but damn, I wouldn't get rid of it.

Was folgt sind grob gesagt die fatale Mischung aus wilkürlicher Grenzziehung, Clanfehden und das hin und her zwischen der UDSSR und der NATO. Kein Einzelfall in Afrika, wenn auch noch weitere Faktoren dafür gesorgt haben müssen, dass es in Somalia besonders Hoffnungslos wurde.

Die Geschichte der armen Fischer die zu Piraten werden wird sicher auch deshalb so oft bemüht, weil es komplexe Probleme in einfache Bilder verpackt. Die illegalen Fischtrawler in somalischen Gewässern zeigen aber gleichzeitig auch, wie Paradox diese Piratenmission ""Atalanta"" eigentlich ist.

Mein Lieblingsbeispiel dafür ist allerdings die Geschichte mit dem Gekaperten T-72 Panzern. Piraten haben 2008 einen Ukrainischen Frachter entführt, der plötzlich 32 Panzer, unmengen Munition und Granatwerfer an Bord hatte. Nachdem einer Seeblockade durch die US Marine und einer Lösegeldzahlung haben sich die Piraten verzogen.

Was blieb war ein Ukrainischer Frachter der seine heiße Fracht unter ""Atalanta"" Begleitschutz im angeblichen Ziel Kenya abliefern durfte. Das Problem bei der Sache: Kenya nutzt als NATO Verbündeter westliche Waffensysteme und kann mit Russischen T-72 nichts anfangen. Die Panzer rollen heute durch den Völkermord im Sudan.

My point was that the Swedish speakers (both in Finland and Sweden) howl in protest any time anyone so much as suggests that perhaps Swedish shouldn't be something which all Finns who want an education are forced to learn, but that Sweden, which has a substantial population of people who're ethnically Finnish and speak the language, does not pay the same respect in kind.

I think also, with the downvotes in your previous posts, you explained what you meant quite badly and, to be honest, in quite a brusk fashion. When you explain things so bluntly it just ruffles a lot of feathers and makes people irritated, where as if you soften your language a bit, generally people will at least listen to you. I think it's partly due to all the trolls on the internet.

To be fair, in Greece sodomy isn't illegal, it's just that the age of consent is different. Whilst I would prefer they be the same, it's no where near as bad as criminalisation of homosexual acts. It's just a two year difference in the age of consent. Not exactly like you're beheading them or anything.

And **Northern Cyprus is not part of the EU**. It's like saying something's illegal in China (mainland) therefor it is also illegal in Taiwan, because China (mainland) claims that Taiwan is its sovereign territory, which (in practice) it is not. The same is true with Northern Cyprus. An EU state (Cyprus) claims that the north of the island of Cyprus is under control of the Cypriot government (which is an EU member state) *however* in practice the north of the island of Cyprus is autonomous and completely not under the control of the Cypriot (the EU member state) government.

You can't claim that Northern Cyprus is part of the Republic of Cyprus, and then also acknowledge that Norther Cyprus is the one making the laws. Either you acknowledge that the land belongs to the Republic of Cyprus and then use Cypriot law for your map *or* you acknowledge that Northern Cyprus is a break away region with its own laws and therefor *not part of the European Union*.

&gt; Ich will zunächst klarstellen, dass ich vor einigen Jahren extrem für die Piratenpartei war, ich war mir sicher, dass sie wie damals die Grünen erst belächelt würden, letztendlich aber als etablierte Partei einsteigen könnten.
&gt; 
&gt; Doch die letzten 2 Jahre haben eine Partei gezeigt, die sich andauernd streitet (und zwar nicht im positiven Sinne des Diskurses), dessen Führung sich einfach völlig daneben benimmt (Julia Schramm war da so eine). Es kommt mir auch so vor, als würden viele die Partei so als ihren Egotrip für den eigenen Erfolg und die Karriere ausnutzen wollen, anstatt wirklich was für die Partei leisten zu wollen (Die Schramm war da wirklich das beste Beispiel, aber da gab es noch andere).

Okay, wo jemand was macht, geschehen auch Fehler. Aber wurden diese Leute nicht alle ausgewechselt?

&gt;Der basisdemokratische Ansatz ist auch teilweise schlecht durchdacht: Zu viele Leute stellen zu viel Müll vor, am Ende hat man aus hunderten von Anträgen eine paar wenige herausgesucht und man hat alles nur oberflächlich behandelt.

Na, so ist das aber schon lange nicht mehr. Anträge brauchen Unterstützer, sonst kommen sie nicht dran. Das fegt schon viel von vornherein weg. Den Rest haben die Leute auf jeden Fall nicht weniger aufmerksam gelesen als Abstimmende anderer Parteien; sogar mehr (imho).

&gt; Der Hammer kam dann auch noch vor ein paar Monaten als auf der Piraten-Startseite beworben wurde, dass man doch zum Protest auf den Mumble-Server kommen soll! Genau, wir protestieren jetzt alle auf unserem privaten Mumble-Server, damit erreichen wir sicher irgendwas. Und seit genau dem letzten Punkt, ist die Partei für mich weltfremd.

Ja, äh, ne, so war das aber nicht ganz. Das war ein Mobilisierungstreffen 4 Tage vor den **echten** Demos, wo sich (unsere) Aktivisten vorab bisschen eingeheizt und gegenseitig ein letztes Mal informiert haben. Wir machen ja schon ab und zu richtig blöde Sachen, aber das gehört klar in die selbe Kategorie wie die erfundenen/aus dem Zusammenhang gerissenen und daher vermeintlich blödsinnigen EU-Normen.

&gt; Und ich stehe mit dieser Meinung sicherlich nicht alleine, ansonsten würde die Wähler ja nicht weniger werden. Und nein, das habe ich nicht ""aus dem Spiegel"", wie es jemand anders geschrieben hat.

Aus irgendeinem Medium wirst du es aber haben, und irgendwie bin ich bereit zu wetten, dass dieses Medium über unsere inhaltlichen Initativen nicht ganz so umfangreich berichtet hat. Kann ich verstehen, die niedrig hängenden Früchte lassen sich leichter pflücken…
 
&gt; Übrigens gefällt mir das Wahlprogramm schon und immer wenn ich mal aus Spaß einen der ""Wahl-o-Mats"" benutzt habe, war die Piratenpartei mit Abstand vorne. Nur glaube ich heute nicht mehr, dass die Partei das so umsetzen wird / kann, einfach weil sie andauernd in Fettnäpfchen tritt und keiner sie ernst nimmt. Das betrifft doch die SPD derzeit genauso, die haben halt nur Glück, weil sie so viele Stammwähler haben.

Das verstehe ich leider nicht. Ich würde nie ""benimmt sich manchmal etwas eigenartig"" mit etwas wie ""macht Gesetze, die mir gar nicht schmecken"" gleichsetzen.

&gt;Additional right: Rooming house landlords may enter rooms, without any notice requirement, where housekeeping services are provided by the landlord.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"&gt;Well, speaking Finnish is as much a part of Finnish speaking Swedes' culture as speaking Swedish is part of Swedish speaking Finns' culture now, isn't it? We're not talking about the odd emigre, there are significant populations of the respective minorities in each country.

I can agree that we're not talking about a single immigrant, and that there are large Finnish communities in Sweden, however they are *all* immigrants to Sweden. They all made the move to Sweden knowing they'd have to adopt the Swedish culture. The Swedes who lived in Finland in ye olden times were their from the start of Finland.

That's what's important here. The Swedes in Finland didn't immigrate (well, some of them did) they are part of Finland from the beginning. The Fins in Swede *did* immigrate and *chose* to leave behind their own culture. 

This is the thing about countries and immigration, you accept what's already there. Immigrants make their decision to adopt the new culture. They know they'll have to learn the language. But if you, and a bunch of other people with other languages decided to start your own country, you get to pick what languages you speak and if you speak multiple. The people who made Sweden, spoke one language. The people who made Finland spoke two. Therefor, immigrants respect the status quo. 

You can't just ignore this bit of the history and create this very simplistic view. 

Furthermore, I don't know why you see it as obnoxious. The Fins want to have two languages, and they like that. Most other countries don't want to have two languages, and Finland's fine with that. There's no reason to judge each other on this one. Surely different countries have their own special ways of working and we might as well just let run their country as they please, without simplifying it down to human characteristics? I mean, you can't give a nation person like qualities. Nations are not people. Countries cannot be snooty, or obnoxious. They just be. And they do.

So just by doing the typical touristic route you'll aready be in the middle of it. If you'd like to choose the shows that might be more to your liking, just google La Merce 2013 around September 15th and you should easily find a website detailing all the things going on. My personal recomendation is the Correfoc, so that you can see how crazy some of our traditions can be.

For skateboarding, two of the most famous spots are Plaça Universitat and the square in front of MACBA (which is just 5 mins away by foot). There are also some half-pipes scattered around, like in the beach walk for instance. But I'm not into it so maybe some other redditor can give you better suggestions.

For the off-beat path, Montserrat is good since it's a pretty oddly shaped mountain and the monastery on top is a nice place, even though it can sometimes be crowded if there is some religious thing going on. Within the city I'd recommend you visit el Parc de la Ciutadella, which is a somewhat nice big park to walk around, the neighbouhood of Gràcia any night, specially squares like la Plaça de la Vila o la Plaça de la Revolució, or maybe a walk down la Rambla del Poblenou to the sea, if you'd like to see a more local and mildler version of Gràcia.

The city is very nice and if you are lucky in September the weather will still be good, but there is a good chance you'll have some rain.

Keep it close to you in your inner jacket or in a tight pocket, and tell your girldfriend to not store anything too valuable in her purse, specially in Les Rambles or in the metro.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"&gt;Look at Greece, look at Spain. Is that the peace we want for Europe? Greek youths holding up Nazi-Merkel flags, for instance.

I hope you realise that this happens within countries, and not just between members of the EU. Whilst and after Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister, many people called and still call her a Fascist. Many people in Britain call Blair a war criminal. Many Americans call Bush a war criminal also. 

It's extremely unsurprising that Greeks absolutely hate Merkel. It would be more surprising if they didn't hate her. This is the consequence of having a joined up political system. Our politicians get to have influence over each other, and they get to blame each other. 

Non of these problems are specific to the EU, or even specific of bad government. In England a few years back, there were massive riots all across the country. A few years back, there were huge protests in London against student tuition fees and the government's decision to raise them. Riots were had and things broken. The same happens in Greece, but because they hate some one from another country (Merkel) we think that the EU is tearing apart Europe. That just doesn't add up to me. 

Further more, do you know how much petty legislation is implemented by the Reichstagg and how much petty legislation is passed by the Bundestag and the Bundesrat. Wow do you think petty legislation is so much the fault of the EU. Furthermore, shouldn't more petty legislation come from the EU, given that it is basically the thing that oversees the smooth running of the Common Market? Which is a very technical thing, which requires very petty and very precise legislation.

true,Leonichol,EURO,European Union,"&gt;and that means nations will force U.S.-based Internet giants like Google, Facebook, and Twitter, to store their user data in-country

Storing data in-country (usually Ireland) isn't going to help if the company has an American-based business presence. As the Patriot Act allows the US government to force US companies into handing over data from outside the US. Failing to do so can result in anything from a fine to complete shut down. Compared to the fines for a Safe Harbour violation this is clearly the choice to go for. Never mind the fact that at least the British ICO has said fines will not be forthcoming for organisations affected by this.

The real point we should be concentrating on here is that the EU Data Protection Directive is not being enforced correctly regarding its Safe Harbour allowance. And that is what needs to be changed.

Rather comically, it was suggested in a conference by the British OpenRightsGroup yesterday that EU citizens accessing services in the US be presented with a big red warning instructing them that their data will subject to US inspection if they continue. An idea, which while clearly not going to happen, would be extraordinarily effective.

Of course, the real solution here is not to dictate to the US how it handles its own affairs (which is inclusive of the data we give it), but rather to instead start building European replacements to the big US internet behemoths.

Also this is my preception of things, and I'm not the standard Finland-Swede, I can guarantee you that. I happened to be the only kid in school who hadn't learned Finnish at home, hence my lack of motivation for it and together with my Finnish teacher not being very good, led to me not learning it very well. I've met Finland-Swedes who speak Finnish better than Finns.

You have to understand that we have always been able to get that service in our language, not being able to get it is a pretty new development. The language border in the south was still intact in the 50s , only to be destroyed in the 60s with urbanization along the coast, where we've lived since the 12th- 13th century. In the place where I live there wasn't a single finnish school in the 60s and now we Finland-swedes are ini the minority.

Perhaps this explains it best, we've lived here for over 800 years speaking Swedish, why would we want to change that?

Other than that, I think you're just misunderstanding what I wrote. There are different kinds of tenancy, with different attributes. And although Australian law will not be identical to the U.S. laws I'm more familiar with, they're still based on the same English Common Law, and can't help but be similar in many important ways. Tenancy laws are pretty consistent across the U.S., and I expect pretty consistent across the global community of Common Law systems.

Mais attention, rien n'oblige le système à sanctionner une infraction portée à sa connaissance : 

- les juges du siège ont toujours le pouvoir de déclarer quelqu'un coupable sans lui infliger la moindre sanction
- le ministère public décide de l'opportunité des poursuites et donc a le pouvoir de décider de ne rien faire (en France, 80% des affaires résolues sont classées sans suite...)
- le maire (qui en tant qu'officier de police judiciaire, dirige sa police municipale) n'en fait qu'à sa tête
- les policiers et les gendarmes ont le pouvoir de décider que leurs autres missions sont prioritaires sur ce que tu leur signale

That's probably true, Australia doesn't have quite the same constitutional structure we do, and the ACT is extraordinarily broad (*may from time to time collect such statistical information in relation to the matters prescribed for the purposes of this section as he or she considers appropriate*), but some rouge census person can't just waltz in and ask you about your wife's sexual partners and demand you answer right then and there under penalty of law.

This was before you could simply download movies, and by the time the local video store had English *tapes*, I was already fluent. They were NTSC, so my sister and I bought a VCR that could play that on PAL TVs and struck a deal with our parents that they would pay the rental fees, because it was ""educational"". By then we also finally had satellite TV, which my parents previously hadn't deemed necessary, so I could watch shows like MTV's Most Wanted.

Adventure games were really how I built vocabulary, especially Sierra's (""Ken sent me"" -- btw., look what just appeared on Steam...). Descriptions and dialogues were in text and you had to type out what you wanted to do.

I was also lucky that my parents threw me into the deep end and sent me on a two week language vacation to Wales when I only had learned English for about two and a half years, and then again for three weeks. It doesn't sound like much, but being put into a position where you *must* speak early on really helps to get over that barrier where you think of a sentence in your native language first, only to inevitably fail to translate it, and finally begin to just ""think"" in the foreign language.

The problem is that this is really fucking hard. Google, for example, is beyond competent, and full to the brim with Europe's best and brightest already. Coming up with a better competitor especially with all the network effects at play is borderline impossible at this stage.

What we could do is force Google to split its European operation to an independent entity that can share software with its non-EU partner, but which can not have a legal relationship that would allow the US government to compel Google.EU to do a god damn thing. This would keep the good service while keeping the US big brother at bay.

&gt;Abgesehen von jedem Gegenstand kann auch jeder Körper eines gesunden Menschen eine tödliche Waffe sein. (Mit jeweils ein paar Ausnahmen.)

Schön gesagt. Das sag ich auch immer. Bei einem Unbewaffneten Angreifer geht man jedoch zumeist davon aus, dass er überwältigt werden kann ohne zu schießen. Man muss bedenken, dass ein Polizist nie alleine unterwegs ist. Beim Messer gilt: Angreifer aus der Distanz stoppen. Und diese Distanz ist groß! Ein Messer ist ab wenigen Metern um Welten gefährlicher als eine Pistole. 

Es wurden Versuche gemacht mit trainierten Messerkämpfern und Soldaten. Folgender Aufbau:

Ein Soldat stand am freien Feld, Waffe im Holster. Der Angreifer ging auf ihn zu, mit versteckt gehaltenem Messer. Die Soldaten sollten, sobald sie das Messer sehen, schießen. Klingt nach Zielübungen, wenn man das Messer nicht erst auf einen Meter zieht. Richtig?

Zonk. Bis auf ganz wenige Ausnahmen wären die Soldaten tot ab einer Sichtungsdistanz von 7m. Wenn es nicht sogar mehr war...

Und ab spätestens knapp 5m hatten sie nicht mal die Waffe ganz aus dem Holster. ಠ_ಠ

Messer sind das übelste was einem begegnen kann und die Entwaffnung ist nahe an unmöglich.

Die deutsche Polizei trägt keinen distanzüberwindenden Taser. Das hat Gründe. (Für Zivilisten ist mindestens das Führen verboten, Besitz müsste ich nachlesen...)

Ein (1) Schuß! Danach muss ich Kartusche wechseln. Das wird schnell ein Zeitproblem: Der steuert auf mich zu, ich schieße, treffe nicht (oder nicht richtig) und ich hab verkackt. Keine Zeit zum Nachladen und zum Waffe ziehen auch nicht mehr. Gute Nacht.

Es ist schwer zu sagen, wie sich der Taser bei diesen Feuchtigkeitsverhältnissen verhält. Wahrscheinlich ganz normal, aber für wahrscheinlich ist keine Zeit.

Einen Taser steckt man nicht so leicht weg wie Pfefferspray oder Schlagstock, aber es kann passieren. Gerde in diesem Zustand. Manche Menschen erholen sich auch sehr schnell. Beispiel: Angreifer wird getroffen und stürzt. Im Sturz reißen die Elektroden aus, wenn er unten ankommt springt er gleich wieder auf. Die Schmerzen merkt er dank Drogen nicht. So Dinge passieren.

Also der Polizist hatte keine Chance etwas anderes als die Waffe einzusetzen. Hab ihr gesehen wie nah der war?

Ganz im Gegenteil. Er hat zu spät geschossen. Er hat den bewaffneten Angreifer viel zu nah an sich ran gelassen.

Und selbst dann! Selbst dann gibt er nur den Stop-Schuss in die Brust ab, geht zurück und hofft (zurecht, Gott sei Dank), dass es reicht. Er hätte leicht die Position gehabt um direkt zu töten. Dann wären es aber drei Schüsse gewesen...

Alles in Allem war dieser Polizist unter Einsatz seines Lebens extrem rücksichtsvoll.

Io ormai non li compro quasi mai, tranne, appunto la domenica (Sole pi� Repubblica) e quando sono dai miei gli do giusto una sfogliata; le pagine che trovo pi� interessanti sono sempre quelle con editoriali e corsivi, come su la Repubblica dove in una sola pagina ti ritrovi Serra, Augias e, se ti va bene, articoli come quelli di Safran Foer di qualche settimana fa.

Nur: **Warum ist er überhaupt so nah an ihn ran?** Auch wenn man's im Video nicht sieht... er muß ja zu ihm in den Brunnen gestiegen sein, geht ja  nicht anders. Das ist mir unbegreiflich. Wenn ein nackter Mann im Brunnen steht und sich selbst verletzt, dann kann man doch nicht im Ernst davon ausgehen, daß gutes Zureden da etwas bewirkt.  Der Polizist hat's gut gemeint, ja... aber welch traurige Ironie: Da geht der Polizist zu ihm in den Brunnen, redet ihm gut zu, damit dieser sich nicht weiter verletzt, muß dann aber zwecks Eigenschutz auf ihn schießen... das kann nicht Sinn der Sache sein!

Natürlich... im nachhinein ist das leicht gesagt. Aber die Polizei wird doch wohl Übungen durchführen, wie bei bestimmten Situationen zu verfahren ist. Und ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, daß - salopp gesagt - bei der Übung ""*Verwirrte Person, die sich mit tödlicher Waffe selbst verletzt*."" es gelehrt wird, so nah an besagte Person heranzutreten, und sich damit auch selbst in Gefahr zu bringen.

Deshalb muß die Person von einer gewissen Distanz aus **sofort** bewegungsunfähig gemacht werden: Schuß ins Bein! Dann kann er nicht mehr aufstehen und hat erst gar keine Möglichkeit, jemanden zu bedrohen. Aber wahrscheinlich dürfen die das nicht, wenn der nur rumsteht und niemanden unmittelbar bedroht. Aber tut mir leid, dann muß das eben geändert werden.

true,Bezbojnicul,ROMA,Internetistan,"&gt;but can we really say that Macedonian is just a ""dialect"" of Bulgarian or Serbian? Are the languages truly mutually intelligible?

Macedonian belongs to the Eastern group of South Slavic languages and is very close to dialects of western Bulgaria (Standard Bulgarian is based on Eastern dialects). Now, whether Macedonian is a dialect of Bulgarian or a separate language is more of a political than linguistic question (""[A language is a dialect with an army and a navy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_language_is_a_dialect_with_an_army_and_navy)"" as the saying goes).

Now the whole south-slavic linguistic continuum is weird in a sense. There are more differences between ""[Croatian dialects](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Croatian_dialects.PNG)"" than between ""Standard Serbian"" and ""Standard Croatian"" (Both based on the Shtokavian dialect, and virtually the same language). So if Macedonians would have self identified as Serbians, it wouldn't be very different from Croatians (the area around Zagreb speaks the Kajkavian dialect, which is quite different to ""Standard Croatian"", for example).

&gt;Was ""Macedonia"" as an idea created by the Yugoslav republic

From what I've read, intelectuals from the area had 3 tendencies: To identify as Serbs, to identify as Bulgarians, or to identify with the regional, ""Macedonian"" identity (see how varied the old maps on [this page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Macedonia) are). Afaik, Tito encouraged the 3rd intelectual faction, and helped create a ""Macedonian"" identity, although its seeds existed before Tito (late 19th c.). So the ideological consolidation of the ""Macedonian nation"" happened later than other ""nationalisms"" that's why many people feel it's a new thing.

See also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian_nationalism

&gt;similar to how the ""Moldovan"" language/identity is about as different from Romanian as Manchester english is from London?

I would refrain from using the Moldovan paralel, as it might bias you to react emotionally to the whole issue. Also, language and identity are not always so linked as is the case with Romanians. Czechs and Slovaks, Danes, Swedes and Norwegians speak very simmilar languages, but feel part of different ""nations"". Hell, most Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats speak what one might call ""Serbo-Croatian"", but they feel they belong to 3 different nations, regardless of linguistics.

A book I highly recommend, regarding nations and nationalism, is Benedict Anderson's ""[Imagined communities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagined_communities)""

&gt;I also read flame-fanning claims that its not a ""real"" country.

Well, I'd say it's as real as any country recognized by the UN.
