null,false,themanifoldcuriosity,null,null,null,"&gt;Hello!

Alright m8?

&gt;I'm going on my own into the city, and have signed up for a pub crawl, specifically the Camden Pub Crawl, tonight.

As luck would have it, I have been on this exact crawl before with a bunch of foreign folk and can tell you what to expect. 

&gt;What am I going to experience at this pub crawl?

You are going to get fahkin munted m8^1. Ideally, anyway. 

Before things start, you're going to want a nice big meal to line your stomach. Don't worry about puttiing on weight, you'll probably chunder it all up later. 

On the crawl itself, you will meet your allotted representative - who will be a relentlessly perky student trying to make a bit of extra cash, who will give you a handful of free drink tokens and then lead you, like sheep on a rope, in a line from bar to bar down the big long road that constitutes Camden's Recreational Debauchery district. She might be fit, but there's no point trying to chat her up - she doesn't have time. Instead, glom onto the nicest looking group of people you can see. They'll probably be Spanish or Italian. Whoever it is, make friends with them quickly and make sure they intend to see the crawl through - because there is a high likelihood that you will get turned around at some point and lose people. In these situations, a friendly face is vital (seriously, whose idea was it to go on a pub crawl alone? You must be with some people, right? Maybe you're gregarious, I dunno...). Anyway, Camden's pubs on a Saturday night are not like Cheers. They are loud and busy as fuck. You WILL need to be making friends at your start point because after that, everyone will be off in their own world of alcopops and ale.

Now usually when I'm on a night out, I like to start with the beers. You say you do not like British beers - that's okay, they're supposed to taste that way. But American booze is freely available at every place you'll be at so feel free to partake of a Coors or the like, if you wish. A pint of beer offers some advantages: It is big, so you can nurse it. You have something to sip at just in case a stranger is boring you. The actual alcohol content is comparatively low, so you won't get proper ratarsed* too quickly and embarrass yourself. And you don't have to get up and go to the bar to replenish so much - which is good because the bar will be rammed to fuck^2. Walking around with a pint tells people you are ready to be friends with them and that you are a person worth being friends with. I will estimate that you will be able to stomach four or five pints in two hours before becoming a bit Brahms &amp; Liszt^3 . You may choose at this point to switch to spirits - a Jack &amp; Coke perhaps? Be warned, these drinks, though delicious, cost as much if not more than pints, contain more alcohol and will rape your wallet and whatever time you spend at the bar queuing for them. So be very conscious of how much you're spending at this point, especially if you get into...

**The Round**

Once you have a good group of friends, you may get into The Round. This is where one person buys the drinks for everyone else in sequence. Now this is advanced British Drinking Technique so it may not happen to you, but bear it in mind if it does, because accepting drinks bought during a round and then failing to get a round in yourself later is considered the poorest of all form and could lead to you being deported. If someone in your group offers to ""get a round in"" and you don't feel like drinking at least the same number of drinks as there are people in your group - politely decline. Everyone will understand.

**The End**

At some point you will be so banjaxed^5 that you will feel the need to go home. Immediately. But not before paying a visit to Mr Armitage^6 . Once you're done here, you will need to cap things off with a nice kebab^7 . Fast food outlets are plentiful around Camden high street so take your pick. For the authentic experience however, it has to be the kebab'n'chips. There will be pictures of what the stuff look like on the walls so pick the thing that you like the looks of the best and try not to feel too disappointed when you receive the package itself. The most popular post-drinking kebab is the ""doner"". The doner kebab is reformed lamb shaved in strips off an ""elephant leg"" (you'll know when you see it). The meat then goes into some pitta bread (which is kind of like an American football with all the stuffing removed), and garnished with salad and various sauces (yoghurt and/or chili). Consume on the bus home and try not to get stabbed. Or get a taxi (do not eat in the taxi - they will take it out your ass if you mess up their ride) and try not to get stabbed.

GOOD LUCK!

How about reading [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_among_LGBT_youth) and justifying the difference in LGBT suicide rates, caused by being removed from the rest of society. How about this paragraph?

Then why constantly bring up the ""fear of accused of being racist"" when the official reports only mention that in-passing, instead focussing on other, more direct causes?

Are you seriously asserting that, in a time when ALL statutory rape cases were ignored by the police across the whole country, that these specific ones were ignored for entirely different reasons? Can you not see in utterly idiotic that argument blatantly is? This is why I question your intelligence. It defies logic.

Oh, great, the faux outrage gambit. You do internets well!

It's a PERFECT analogy. You are making a claim that the targets of a crime were chosen for one reason, ignoring the simple fact that they were by far the largest single grouping of potential targets in the country. 

You also completely choose to ignore the true commonality in the victims: they were all ""easy prey"", coming from problem homes, many of them with pre-existing substance abuse issues and living in care. Our society does not care about these people today and it certainly didn't historically. 

You want outrage? You are now pretending to care about these kids purely because it presents an opportunity to shit on people who look different. That is sickening.

null,false,Alagorn,null,null,null,"There was an episode of Doctors where a father came out as transvestite or transgender (pre-op and I believe identified as a woman). He has a wife who feels destroyed by this revelation and a gay son who isn't happy about this either. You sort of identify with all three.

Firstly the mother wouldn't want the hassle really, and I have to admit I don't think many do want their spouse to turn out to be transgender. She feels her family is destroyed and acts like her husband is dead, her husband identifies as a woman and it kind of makes their life together up to that point a lie. So she is kind of bigoted and dismissive of her husband when he tries to reconnect, but you'd be lying if you didn't identify with her feelings and most people tend to live in a straight bubble where they don't know any transgender people personally, have no issue with the concept but would freak out if their husband came out.

The gay son is distraught and it's interesting because it shows that just because someone is gay doesn't mean they're 100% supportive of transgender folk. Kind of like minorities being bigoted towards other minorities. It's also hard for him because he's struggling to come out as gay as well.

Finally the transgender father, who probably has it hardest, is loving, gentle and vulnerable but is lost because of his wife and son's reactions on top of how it'll affect how society feels about him. Some of the issues raised are changing the name legally and the two family members find that difficult, kind of like their husband and dad doesn't exist any more. He's very dedicated to supporting his son but the mother is dismissive of him. It also doesn't show him having any support from friends so it makes it even worse for him because he's incredibly lonely.

I guess you feel the least sorry for the mum because at worst people will only make fun of her for marrying a man who identifies as a woman although she says things like ""get out"" to her husband and not wanting him around, but it certainly grounds all the issues in a relatable setting. It does makes straight people think ""what would I do?"" and it also makes us dislike the mum and sympathise most with the dad. It also shows a different side to society's attitudes. Before, you'd think it's straight people verses LGBT but here you have a straight woman and her gay son verses his transgender father/her husband. Very tragic and sad it split the family.

You could also see it as a twist on the classic family break up/father &amp; son relationship story, except you have a transgender father and his gay son. There's also the whole thing with coming out as gay not being a big deal to anyone because it's juxtaposed with coming out as transgender being the thing which causes the family breakup.

It doesn't really set in stone the conclusion though. The dad give his son another opportunity to talk in which he walks out, the dad leaves rather sadly and the mother is left alone in the house. In the scheme of things, it's likely they just need to get used to the new circumstances and eventually make up, even if the mum and dad stay split up, but it represents the idea that the issue of attitudes towards transgender in society hasn't been concluded. We still haven't put the negative attitudes behind us but there's also the idea that anyone is capable of freaking out to big unexpected changes to their life or how they had previously perceived their father.

This episode stuck in my mind for this reason, the father came across as one of the loneliest and cut off people I could think of, but also the twist that his son comes out as gay makes the situation feel so unique it stays in my brain.",null,0,null,1429723171,null,0,1429727119,0,cql023i,null,t3_33h3cv,null,t1_cql023i,null,t3_33h3cv,null,null,null,1432540126,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

[Of those killed by loyalist paramilitaries:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles#Responsibility)

* 877 (~85.4%) were civilians
* 94 (~9%) were members of loyalist paramilitaries
* 41 (~4%) were members of republican paramilitaries
* 14 (~1%) were members of the British security forces


But none of this was an accident; The vast majority if not all of their intelligence and weapons came from British Security Forces^[1](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/northern-irelands-police-colluded-with-loyalists-to-cover-up-catholic-murders-8899964.html) ^[2](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/2955941.stm) ^[3](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/collusion-exruc-special-branch-boss-my-shame-at-cadre-of-security-force-personnel-involved-in-northern-ireland-loyalist-murders-29698720.html) ^[4](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/british-state-involved-in-mass-murder-on-british-soil-colluded-with-loyalist-paramilitaries-in-80-deaths-between-1972-and-1978-31091074.html) ^[5](http://www.caj.org.uk/files/2015/01/30/No._66_The_Apparatus_of_Impunity_Human_rights_violations_and_the_Northern_Ireland_conflict,_Jan_2015_1.pdf). They were by and large an extension of the security services. It is clear that their supposed targets; i.e the IRA were in fact not, otherwise **4%**, is a pretty terrible result. The reality is that the intended targets of Loyalist Paramilitarism were innocent Catholics; their campaign quite simply was a coordinated campaign of terror with the backing and logistical support of the state.

It does *not* mean they can use any grounds - as it says the grounds must be reasonable. Reasonable grounds may include, for example, your pets being particularly and unusually destructive, complaints being received from neighbours (more dogs, but the tenancy was not prepared for you). I am not an expert in this area, but I expect the inclusion of the word ""reasonable"" means the clause escapes being unfair per se, instead it is how the landlord acts that is important. 

By giving consent now, the onus is on the landlord to show their ground for changing their mind is reasonale later - and the risk they perceive is not dealt with through the increased deposit you paid. Ultimately, a court would decide what is reasonable, based on the specific facts. The risk is always there, but the landlord cannot just change their mind without reason, or make something up - they would need to show an objective and good reason.

He's likely to have trouble passing a budget, the Tories will vote against of course, the SNP have the choice of supporting an austerity budget that ploughs billions into trident, or voting against it and bringing the government down. They may well see bringing the government down as the better option than being seen as a pro-trident pro-austerity party which goes directly against what they have pledged.

Additional risks are that ignoring the party that Scotland will have overwhelmingly voted for the represent them in Westminster is only likely to stir up anti-Westminster and pro-independence feelings. The SNP may see this neglect as sufficient grounds for holding another independence referendum, Miliband could go down as the PM that broke up the UK.

Finally, while the majority in the rest of the UK might not like the idea of any Labour-SNP agreement, I think most people would be mature enough to accept the democratic outcome. Some, like myself, would even welcome a Labour-SNP government - as the SNP see to be a genuinely left wing and anti-austerity party in the way that Labour aren't.

If you only consume media through an outlet owned by Rupert Murdock, you can watch a documentary or a drama that is vaguely political but you will never be exposed to opinions at odds with the interests of the Murdocks, News Corp, or BSkyB.

Do you think that politicians lobby against legislation that would impact BSkyB's profits do so because they think it's a noble cause or because they know they are influential?

One of the first notable players to spend his entire career at Tottenham is Bobby Buckle who was one of the founders back in 1882 who also happened to be our very first captain ever. (Not to mention the first ever player to score a goal in lilywhite.) Along with Bobby was Jack Jull who as well spent his entire career at Tottenham and was one of the founding members. 

Moving out of the early days of the club we fast forward to 1960's where we saw a single player become a one club player, Ron Henry. (Who actually recently just past December 2014) He made almost 250 appearances for the club and scoring a whopping 1 goal. (In his defense he was a defender)

Since then (besides King) as far as I know there hasn't been a one club player for Tottenham. That being said you don't need to be a one club player to become a legend or a hero for the club. Heck, Spurs have tons of those. Ginola, Freund, Sheringham, Gazza, Ardiles, Ricky Villa, Hoddle, Perryman, Blanchflower, Greaves...I could be here all day typing about notable players in Spurs history.

We definitely disagree on both Lamela and Mason.

Lamela was anaphylactically allergic to positive contributions for about 60 minutes, it was painful. Stark contrast to performances of Chadli and Eriksen - or even Bentaleb and Paulinho. There was so much space and time out there, and he was awful.

Having said that, you'd expect a fucking terrible performance from someone who is obviously very short of games, but that explains the poor performance rather than making it somehow good. Watch it back, honestly. First half especially.

The assist was incredibly straightforward, it's made by Mason's quick thinking and I don't think there can be any doubt about that, I really don't. The goal gif thread is pretty much 100% people congratulating Mason, because it's him who wins possession, then runs forward to eliminate the defenders and make Kane's shot much easier. It's perfect off the ball movement.

Saying Rangers fans were ""robbed"" when Rangers were put in the 3rd division is nonsense.

He basically says Inverness is a shit team with shit players.  He says the standard is not high.  Now I've watched zero ICT games this year, so I have no idea of the standard of the football on offer up north.  I reckon this guy has watched an equal number of games.

On attendances:
28,643 for Celtic v ICT; 21,227 for Falkirk v Hibs
1) It's not cheap to go to these games. 
2) It's only a semi-final 
3) It's played at Hampden 
4) Those attendances would fill all but the countries 3 largest football stadiums, and you can't expect Falkirk and Hibs to travel to Aberdeen to play at an over-capacity Pittodrie.

The fixed point was the Doctor appearing dead, not the Doctor dying.

They didn't time travel, and how would that be a deus ex machina.

&gt; The whole of time throwing a hissy to let yourself marry somebody

What.

&gt; Half the stuff that they do in Angel episodes after Blink to escape 

A bit generic. Letting the artificial gravity drain? Producing a paradox? Not blinking?

&gt; Daleks forgetting The Doctor because 'hacking the mainframe' 

Heh. Not a deus ex machina: Oswin's ability with technology is mentioned and shown a lot.

&gt; Magically getting out of a time stream that will almost certainly kill you

The Doctor is immune to the effects of his time stream (he is not scattered through his timeline). Also he talks about a possibility of not returning (""If I don't make it back, and I might not""), not a certainty.

&gt;Saving Gallifrey because TARDIS' and an artifact

Heh, not a deus ex machina, the technology was already introduced in the episode.

&gt; Destroying Dalek ships by exploding with regeneration energy

Heh, not a deus ex machina, regeneration energy was shown to be that powerful in *The End Of Time*.

* having no gender (being agender, nongendered, genderless, genderfree, or neutrois);

As for the two photographs, I don't see what point you're trying to make. They look equally valid. Is it that she hasn't been portrayed in a feminine enough light? The other picture doesn't seem much different.

I think given how few transgendered people there are that there is a disproportionate amount of coverage in the media (and here on reddit.) I don't think that's really a bad thing, necessarily, unless it's drowning out reasonable discussion.

As for inclusiveness in television/films/games/whatever, what's the proportion of transexual people versus transexual characters? Is there even a deficiency at all? These kinds of things should only be roughly representative anyway. 

People can identify however they like in my book, but I'm getting fed up with the hyper-sensitivity in general, although that seems to be something affecting everything these days - a reason or excuse to be offended.

Parting Of The Ways

- Power of time vortex was clearly established in Boom Town. Bad Wolf is pre destination paradox so no foul

- Doomsday 

Void energy is clearly established as well as the hole being a gateway to the void and the levers controlling it

Last Of TimeLords - Humans having small amounts of psychic power has been seen multiple times as have time lords manipulating brainwaves. Archangel was established as a psychic network. Given what we've seen of Time Lords and technology nothing to much of a stretch.

All held together by paradox machine which snapped things back anyway

Journeys End - Doctor Donna is pre destination paradox, Daleks not setting up a password tragically isn't the stupidest thing they've ever done and human/time lord combined psyche would come up with new ideas.

EOT - Timelords are powerful, connection channeled through star. No Deus Ex.

Basically, anything can not be a Deus Ex Machina plot if you bullshit enough. 

Pre destination paradox is almost an alternate name for Deus Ex Machina though within Sci Fi. 

Others I can forgive, but Big Bangs opening 5 minutes isn't a pre destination paradox, it uses that as a thin veil for lazy writing because how pre destination paradoxes are established is when somebody in timeline A gets to point 3 then goes back to point 2 and alters the outcome creating Timeline B and erasing timeline A (or not depending on who writes it). 

The Doctor had literally no way to escape and create point C, let alone get back to Point B. 

We can conceive that Rose and 9 got to Satellite 5 in a previous timeline without hints, perhaps things went much worse causing Rose to scatter the words as warning...

You get the idea, but as established in Pandorica Opens The Doctor cannot escape the Pandorica so... Sorry to ruin the episode for you.

No, it's run on the grounds that it is specifically a place for the input of people who are BME. If you're a false leg manufacturer and you want to discuss improvements to your product, do you ask for the input of people who have two legs? Of course not, because they aren't affected by the product and cannot have any first hand experience. In the same way, you don't invite people who aren't BME to an event discussing people's personal experiences of discrimination against BME people. Because if you're not BME you don't have anything to contribute.

1. Churchill square. It's alright, worth a look in. Lego shop!

2. The Laines, the important bit. They can be a bit tricky, so asking directions might be in order, or charter a map from Google.

3. Laines highlights: Snoopers Paradise, Whirligig, The Komedia, Kissing fishes, actually, just have fun exploring, the fun is in the browsing. There's curiosities aplenty.

4. Meeting house Laine, a different set of lanes hidden away nearer the sea. You will need to ask directions to find it, or stumble across it yourself.

5. Sea Life Center. SHARKS! and big turtles and stingrays and little fishes and big fishes. 

6. Pier has an Arcade, Resident Evil has Multiplayer. Can recommend Ladywife and husband-man zombie slaying, good fun.

7. Pubs. There are many, all excellent. Ye Olde King and Queen is a fun novelty, as it is a massive Tudor Guild Hall. 

For Foody times, theres the food district directly North and North-East of the Royal Pavillion (Another thing that UKIP thought was a Mosque). Japanese, Mexican, Italian, British, all the foods, all high quality.

Which is - to support Labour in return for small concessions here and there, additional devolution, and to show the Scottish public that they ""stand up for Scotland"" by voting down or amending the occasional bill.

If the SNP demonstrate that voting SNP can produce a stable UK Labour government - boom - what's Scottish Labour's purpose any more? It has no reason to exist and will be forced to 1) dissolve over a period of time due to massive infighting, or 2) become autonomous to differentiate itself from both UK Labour and the SNP (and I suspect an autonomous unit might be neutral on the independence issue or support home rule in order to win back voters).

The SNP's place will likely be entrenched as the natural party of government in Scotland for a generation, and that sets them up nicely for incremental devolution or another push for independence down the road...

That's my take on it anyway.

Without a Confidence and Supply deal, the SNP will back Miliband in any confidence motion, but will happily vote down any bill that isn't related to the SNP's manifesto (which is conveniently similar to Labour's; there is *plenty* they will vote for, meaning it'll be difficult to paint them as ""disruptive"").   The challenge for Miliband is that if he wants to pass some legislation outside the scope of the SNP manifesto, he's going to have to strike a deal on *something*.

Beyond that, the SNP can table ""more progressive"" amendments and ""devolution"" amendments to Labour bills. E.g., the devolution of the minimum wage, and an £8.70 minimum wage. Even if the amendments get voted down, the SNP will support Labour's £8 minimum wage and will simultaneously be handed a  stick to beat Labour with - ""The legislation passed is better than nothing.

&gt;[27] In an individual’s passport the UK Border Agency may have stamped ‘no recourse to public funds’. ‘Public funds’ are defined in the immigration rules, and the benefits and services listed do not include education or any education funding. As a result, this condition in a passport makes no difference to a learner’s eligibility, which must be decided under the normal eligibility conditions.

Well, no recourse to public funds does actually only apply to social security benefits which you claim. Apprenticeships are employers claiming though, so whether or not you have recourse to public funds is moot.

I have however actually found the exact funding criteria as listed with the Skills Funding Agency in England, and it looks like as a spouse of a UK or EU citizen you qualify. Providing you or your spouse have been resident for in the EEA for at least 3 years from the start of whenever the apprenticeship would start.

Unless you live in Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland. In which case... I'm not going to pretend to know. Probably fine. Of course, again, most of this is based on funding you won't be eligible for as you have a level 4 qualification. So whilst you're eligible to undertake one, you are not eligible for funding - but you can do one. No problem in that regard. Just have to persuade an employer you'll be worth the extra cost to them.

With regards to pangender, that often is synonymous with gender fluid, which means that you can kinda identify as any gender at any given day/moment, or none at all. 

So the gender spectrum is very much more than just 'male female and inbetween' you have people who don't identify with any gender at all, who might identify as Agender or genderqueer, some people who identify as both male and female depending on the day, who might identify as genderfluid, genderqueer, or bigender.

Charlie Woolnough from Coincorner explains why he believes Bitcoin has a mainstream future, while Nula Perren of the Island’s female-only taxi firm, The Lady Chauffeurs, gives her view of the future, and Adrian Forbes of TGBEX explains why he sees bitcoin more as a long term investment. Plus Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey sounds a note of caution and Thomas Hockenhull, project curator for modern money, coins and medals at the British Museum shows Zoe what money has been represented by in the past.

The SNP, unsurprisingly, had no confidence in a party that had made such a promise and then a complete u-turn. 

That Labour Government destroyed itself by its own arrogance and Labour's current position on the SNP feels like a similar attitude to me. Labour can treat them as having no clout and try to just hammer their own point through but eventually their Government would collapse once they've pissed off everyone else in parliament enough, just like that past occasion. Short term they can bully it out, long term the instability is going to cause them problems.

You say Scottish voters are more anti-Tory than anything else and I start to think you have as little understanding of what has happened in Scotland after September as many others. Scotland hasn't lurched to the left or all decided the SNP are our chosen dictatorship for life. Scotland has become more engaged and the difference between SNP and Labour is that the SNP are, in this election, speaking in very clear terms. Will they rule out a future referendum? No and here are three conditions. Will they support the Tories? Under no circumstances. 

Labour and the Tories have worked for years in obscuring and obfuscating politics, the less we understand the more we can just vote for the lesser of evils and the political merry-go-round can keep turning. The SNP didn't create the positive referendum campaign that converted voters 2:1 in the later stages to Yes, it was groups like National Collective and a genuine grass roots campaign that did. What the SNP did was learn from it and, with a change of leadership, apply it to the current election. Admittedly this one is easier for them than the coming Scottish election and we'll see if they can keep it going. Their past record has a lot of problems, college cuts to fund free tuition is just one but the SNP are reinventing themselves and Labour are still trying to hammer home the message that they are the only party that can keep out a Tory party who in Scotland are almost extinct. It doesn't make sense and people saw through it in the last Scottish election leading to a majority Labour set up our parliament to never be able to deliver.

Bath City Centre is a bugger - I would avoid on bikes for a meet personally as its so congested and ram packed every weekend come rain or shine - but there are various places on the way which would be perfect for a meet.

[The Globe at Newton St Loe](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Globe/@51.38583,-2.430457,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x5a29ab8319125efa?sa=X&amp;ei=MAE4Ve6EE8nhaOrageAE&amp;ved=0CHoQ_BIwDA) is very easy to get to and is a nice little establishment. It's at the end of the A4, which can be a very fast and intimidating road (when the soddin' council haven't got all of it closed and/or 30mph only!) so those who haven't much exposure to dual carriageways may want to cut through Keynsham.

[Bath Racecourse](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bath+Racecourse/@51.4014548,-2.4522151,13z/data=!4m6!1m3!3m2!1s0x0:0x5a29ab8319125efa!2sThe+Globe!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0xc0cd2d42ce5c6038) isn't so much a drinking/eating establishment, but is a bit more rural and may be easier to get to for 125s who haven't much dual carriageway experience. There is also a bike school there which is where I did my full license, so it's bike friendly. It's an excellent gateway to the city in terms of access.

Alternatively to all above, Southgate car park in Bath city centre has free (and quite honestly, secure and brilliant) underground, lit, security patrolled bike parking. Lots of nice eateries within a 60 second walk of the car park - I am happy to meet a group outside of Bath and escort you through the maze of single way roads and endless traffic lights to it if need be.

One has not won a single thing in his managerial career, while the other has won back to back Bundesliga titles, German cup, and nearly won the CL. In addition, he's done most of this (until recently) on a shoe-string budget and has turned unknowns into some of the hottest commodities today--Subotic, Reus, Gundogan, Hummels, and countless others. To equate or even compare Rodgers to Klopp is a bit much. Klopp is an elite manager. If he were to take over, even w/o CL we'd be able to attract ""marquee"" type signings bc players actually know who he is. In addition, he'd raid the bundesliga which is where we should be focusing our search on (bc there are very obvious diamonds there for dirt cheap). Anyway, I get that a lot of people are hesitant to let Rodgers go, and a lot of that imo comes down to sentiment. No one should forget the start that was this season, the stubborn 4-2-3-1 approach that was clearly not working, after three years still lacking an actual identity, and that he just doesn't seem to be learning from his mistakes.

You are contradicting yourself here. How can you accuse me of being repeatedly wrong and not remember having ever seen my posts?

&gt;Then why constantly bring up the ""fear of accused of being racist"" when the official reports only mention that in-passing, instead focussing on other, more direct causes?

Oh, so you concede that I'm actually right but would prefer it if I prefixed my previous statement with ""too scared and too incompetent"" as well as being frightened of being accused of racism?

I also take umbrage with your accusation of ""constantly"". I mentioned that this was a reason as to why nothing was done. Furthermore I wasn't just referencing the Rotherham scandal. Your insinuation is that, actually these are merely excuses and that they;re just lying to save their bacon.

The list of people trying to bring this issue up was endless. Ann Cryer, Jack Straw, Mohammed Shafiq even said that ""They feel that white girls are less valuable and have less morals"". A researcher was sent on a fucking diversity training course for daring to bring such an issue up.

I am not outraged. I've just seen enough of your posts that I'm no longer shocked at the extent you are willing to go to pretend that the race element of this should not even be noticed and is entirely unrelated to this case. The day this scandal broke I specifically remember your eagerness to find excuses that this wasn't happening and was just part of the imagination of the evil EDL.

&gt;You want outrage? You are now pretending to care about these kids purely because it presents an opportunity to shit on people who look different. That is sickening..

What kids? The kids in this article or the kids from the grooming scandals? It makes absolutely no difference to me, a child is a child and it's horrible when they have their lives destroyed by brutes.

I am not interested in ""shitting"" on people who look ""different"" to me. I know the majority of Pakistani people are not molesting children in the same way I know the majority of white people are not molesting children. The people who do this type of stuff are scum.

It also harms excellence. 

Let's look at the NHS. British Asian doctors who score very well in Medical School where written papers test your knowledge suddenly are unable to speak English and make mistakes around patients while White Doctors do not. Which is suspicious, why? Because there is no rational reason why that would be. If you can turn a spanner in a lab you can turn a spanner in your garage. What tends to be the case is that Indian doctors have misdemeanours reported with greater frequency than British white doctors. And if two doctors are reported for the same issue, the white one tends to be let off. From my personal experience? 

A student had peritonitis. She had major surgery to save her life. She recovered and went back to work. She was failed on purpose after the University told her that she was fine to join. There was a young woman who had her tonsils out and spent the same amount of time recuperating. She was held up as an example of dedication to medicine. 

The difference was skin colour. 

Despite the fact that most Asian doctors speak English as a first language. It seems to me that should an Asian doctor be even slightly difficult to understand he gets labelled as a poor communicator. By contrast no one does the same for accents that are hard to understand within the UK if you are white. Basically? If you are British Asian and have a geordie accent you are much more likely to get pulled up for bad communication than an actual geordie despite the accents being the same. 

This actually harms the work place as Indians are more prone to defensive medicine because they don't want to get called up by patients who are unsatisfied and decide to take it out on their doctor. It also cripples advancement for skilled doctors. 

As I said. It's all fun and games till it is you facing racism. Your argument is ""why should I give a fuck, white people have it easy and it is in my interest to be a racist"". You have no need to help anyone less fortunate than you. 

But one day it will be you. I would rather live in an equal world where it doesn't have to be anyone else rather than a world where one day I can be the one getting fucked by bigotry.

You can be a terrible person. However it is in my interest as a British person to ensure my society does not discriminate on the basis of caste, creed, colour and gender.

Why won't I vote? The answer is simple:

I don't see any more than childish bickering and jeering whenever I watch politicians rally for supporters. I see little substantial promise from any party (save for a few that I address below), and what little is promised either never materialises, or is simply a token gesture designed to pull in more suckers. 

Loyalty to one party or another is another thing I find idiotic. Someone who has ""Always voted for x"" often has little motivation other than misplaced sun-from-arse syndrome - of course, there are exceptions, I accept that.

Labour sent us to war, blindly following a nation that has proven many times over that it cannot keep it's own population safe (not that we do an excellent job either). 

Then we had a recession, jobs were lost and areas previously scattered with factories were liberally smeared with unemployment. Nissan lost the Micra contract, for fucks sake.

Then they cut the social fund, so no-one could get a certification. Now those very same are stuck on welfare, living from the scraps of the well-to-do.

Then they stopped the funding for new employees, and laid off government workers in their thousands. Councils are forced to restructure every few years, getting rid of more and more of their workforce and sending families into anarchy.

So, the past three/four governments that have been in power during my life have failed to help us feed ourselves. They have sent us away to die in deserts and rot in gutters. Am I going to vote for any of them again? *Fuck* no.

Then there are the new(ish) lot. Some not so new, merely coming out of the woodwork. Half of them want us to reject our dark skinned brothers and sisters, and ""reclaim"" Britain. They still haven't addressed the problem of mass exodus by Britons from our island. Whatever happened to Churchill's inspired nation?

The other half promise undeliverable objectives, yet claim to support freedoms and prosperity? You can't fight poverty by reducing working hours. Here's looking at you, Green Party.

So, is there anyone I want to vote for? No. There is not. Should I be forced or pushed into voting for a lesser of evils? **Absolutely not.** Not voting is a gesture, at least on my part, that implies a new party needs to form.

null,false,the_oncoming_storm,CommonWeal,,null,"It's a great question, and I'm not sure I have any answers. But here's what I think will happen anyway.

 1. We'll end up with a Labour government or Lab/Lib coalition after this election. Either arrangement will be a minority, and will have the support of the SNP (officially or unofficially). Even without any deal, the SNP will keep Labour in power as a more-or-less silent partner to begin with. Stability is key. 
 
 2. There will be no change in momentum heading towards Holyrood 2016. I expect a big anti-Labour push from ""the 45"", campaigning for a split SNP/Green ticket. It might be successful enough to push the Greens into 3rd place in the chamber. The big unknown here are A) how many ousted MPs will aim for Holyrood and B) how much infighting will this lead to in Labour. 

 3. I don't expect the SNP to push for another referendum in 2016 - but as no other party will, it doesn't leave another avenue for ""the 45"" (maybe the SSP?). Some will inevitably drop off, but the SNP have 1 year to prepare the groundwork for this. If I was Nicola Sturgeon, I'd publish a manifesto that pushes for devo-nearly-max + barnett retention. That is, powers, but without the black hole. They'll use their mandate from the election and bloc of MPs at Westminster to make sure Labour deliver it (or manufacture grievance if they don't). 

After this, there will be a much, much needed lull for 4 years allowing people to regain their energy. I don't believe anyone has the appetite for another referendum so soon apart from the people who would support UDI in 2 weeks time. Even as someone who loves politics and has been commenting about it now on Reddit for nearly 4 years straight, I certainly don't.

It's quite possible at this point, with no major vote until 2020 (although I expect the council elections in Glasgow will see an interesting campaign) that a good number of people might leave the SNP. However, if the SNP can keep the suggestion that 2021 is the big year for another shot at independence, then I don't think people will be *too* disgruntled.  

Indeed I think a lot of people already see 2020/2021 as being pivotal. Do the Tories get back in power? Will there be an EU referendum? Will Labour have failed to deliver HoL reform and voting reform once again? Will the Conservatives campaign on scrapping or reforming Barnett? (If the UK settlement means we have to deal with ""The Black Hole"" anyway,  it becomes less of a barrier to independence). Are Scottish Labour now an autonomous party? Are they still against home rule? 

There are so many factors here, I've no idea how it'll play out - but I suspect whatever happens it'll be spinnable as the significant change in circumstances the SNP are looking for in order to hold another referendum.  That said, if they don't call one in 2021, I expect they will lose significant support. 

But you're right - the SNP are back to playing the long game. Until the polls begin to clearly favour independence, I don't think Sturgeon will risk it.",null,0,null,1429738081,null,0,1429738300,0,cqla10g,null,t3_33imu8,null,t1_cqla10g,null,t3_33imu8,null,null,null,1432544849,null,11,false,scottishpolitics,t5_2u66o,11,null

Yes and no. It was established, but it did two completely different things.

&gt;Bad Wolf is pre destination paradox so no foul

Indeed, no foul. Bad Wolf creating itself is not the deus ex machina, Bad Wolf's creation is (i.e. the heart of the TARDIS and the implications for the Time War).

&gt;Void energy is clearly established

Only when it's needed. That's the definition of deus ex machina: it's not that it's left unexplained, it's that it's pulled off just when it's needed and completely forgotten.

&gt;Humans having small amounts of psychic power has been seen multiple times as have time lords manipulating brainwaves. Archangel was established as a psychic network

There are so many things wrong with that finale that it's hard to list them. The Archangel network is established to be an hypnotizer for the population. Human beings are passive receivers, they can't actively affect it. Like the Dalek Destroying Buttons in the Vault in *Journey's End*, this plot point takes advantage of a feature the villain would have been completely stupid to add.

&gt;Doctor Donna is pre destination paradox

Uhm, no? The predestination of the metacrisis is a minor issue: the real problem is that the metacrisis itself is a total ass pull.

&gt;Daleks not setting up a password tragically isn't the stupidest thing they've ever done

I fail to see how this matters. That's not even a deus ex machina, that's just faulty writing.

&gt;human/time lord combined psyche would come up with new ideas

Actually I have no problem with that. My question is: why didn't TenToo get a combined mind as well? Now that's an issue.

&gt;connection channeled through star

Yes, but how did the star break the Time Lock? And don't give me the ""it's small"" thing: Time Lords literally invented dimensional engineering, they could shrink a TARDIS as much as they wanted.

&gt;The Doctor had literally no way to escape and create point C, let alone get back to Point B [...] as established in Pandorica Opens The Doctor cannot escape the Pandorica

The Doctor has a number of ways to escape it. We know at least two: scan of living DNA of the prisoner and sonic screwdriver.

Buying young and investing in developing world class players is not only the smartest way for us to progress as a club but its the only way we should if we are to remain/become a powerhouse of European football again. The more we build up the reputation for giving youngsters a chance the more up and coming youngsters we can convince to join us.

Chelsea, City, United and even Arsenal are in a position where they can attract world class players and pay them ridiculous wages, if we start trying to compete with them financially we'll just put ourselves in a hole the owners don't want.

But that's what's so good about Thomas' way of teaching. He really believes in giving you an intuition for sentence structure, dealing with tenses, with grammatical persons and dealing with the most common verbs and concepts we all use whatever language we speak. The problem with a lot of other language courses is that they not only try to school you on all this stuff, but throw in lessons on cases and grammatical rules that you have to memorise and the words for animals or random items of clothing early on (looking at you, Duolingo) which you absolutely don't need. Thomas is just the best, for me in introducing a language and building up a feel for it.

null,false,Kingy_who,cnty-wales,Sent to coventry,null,"Most people here don't like telling people how to vote as it is a personal thing, and it has to be your decision. Maybe there isn't a party that you agree with entirely, most party members don't agree 100% with their party. The point of a party is to group people with similar views on how we should be governed. 

So you need to think about how you want this country to be run, try and think about where you stand on certain main issues. I don't mean specific policies but ideals, do you think the government should help the worst off and distribute wealth from the rich to the poor, or do you think what someone has earned is their own and redistribution should be minimised (or somewhere in between). Do you think the government should enforce a moral code or should we be free to do what we want so long as it doesn't directly harm other people (or somewhere in between). Should we use our natural resources for economic gain regardless of the cost or should we stop burning fossil fuels and take the economic hit (or somewhere in between). Also consider what you particularly dislike, there is no shame in voting against something you hate, rather than for something you particularly like (I'll talk more about this later, about my own personal decision).

Then I would look at the parties policies, [The BBC has a good guide](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2015/manifesto-guide) and see what fits your views. I personally wouldn't take into account specific policy too much as we are very likely to have a hung parliament and what we get is going to be a compromise anyway, but other people think that's all there is. If you are still undecided, tell me what town you live in (you can PM me if you don't want to share that) and I'll tell you the two parties most likely to win in your area, so you can pick your favourite out of those two, to narrow the choices.

**Most important bit:**

**If you are still not happy, show up and spoil your ballot, if you need to be won over, show your vote can be won. No politician is going to care about someone who is too busy watching netflix to vote but they will care if you can be won over.**

Personally I'm voting Labour, but I probably would vote Greens in a safe seat. I don't completely agree with either party, I think we need to do much more to protect the environment and I think we should Legalise and Tax most recreational drugs but I also think nuclear power and GM crops are good things. But I think we need to tackle the deficit slowly and fairly and create jobs for working people and I think we should be increasing income tax on the wealthiest but I don't think we need to cut immigration. I lie somewhere between the two, so my ideal Government would be a Labour/Green coalition. So I look at my constituency and see it is a very tight Conservative/Labour swing seat. Under our current system of voting the national proportion of the vote doesn't matter, but local victories do so I'm voting Labour to get closer to my ideal Government.",null,0,null,1429739064,null,0,1429739384,0,cqlanb8,null,t3_33hm58,null,t1_cqlanb8,null,t1_cql5h4z,null,null,null,1432545211,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

I've found that there are certain arbitrary figures that values cluster either side of. So by buying at just under 100k you're paying a bit of a premium to be under that figure, then will have to absorb that loss in value as you take it over 100k. There is essentially a step drop in value at this point. This all of course depends on things like what you are going to be using the car for and how many miles you are going to want to put on it. If I get 3 years from a car only spending money on servicing, with a £1000 outlay that's a bargain, especially when you get most of that £1000 back when you sell it. Even if you get nothing at resale by then the car doesn't owe you anything and it should still be long before it reaches the other side of that bathtub. Yes if you want 10 years then it's about lower mileage, but with such a small outlay your investment is recouped in a much smaller timeframe.

Mohamed Elneny - A partnership of Elneny and Bentaleb would be so much fun to watch, and with Bentaleb working on the offensive side of his game, a feasible one as well. I wouldn't expect him to overtake Mason right away, but he'd certainly provide good depth if Stambouli &amp; Capoue were shipped off this summer, and at 22 has plenty of growing to do himself.

Claudio Beauvue - Not really necessary, but plays a somewhat similar style to that of Nacer Chadli's on the left for FC Guingamp in Ligue 1. Think he's on 23 goals or something this season but not on the radar of the major clubs due to his age (27) and club. At 5-8 mil, he'd be a steal.

Shkelzen Gashi - 25 goals for Basel this season, scoring a goal or two in practically every game he plays at this point. Old enough to not cost too much, young enough to still contribute for a long while (26, 27 in July). Like Beauvue, also a left winger.  

Steven Caulker - I'll be honest; I'm not a big fan of Fazio or Dier, at least not alongside Vertonghen. I likem enough as 3rd and 4th choice CBs, but Fazio just seems a bit too slow beside Vert and Dier isn't positionally aware enough yet.

For instance, look at Sterling and Coutinho. While neither have been hit by injuries badly, they both went stupid amounts of games without any breaks. Coutinho looked (and still does somewhat) look very tired and Sterling, as we all know so well, was given almost two weeks break mid season.

Two other examples are Sahko and Lucas, but they are both somewhat injury prone (or so it seems) but that further reinforces the need to rotate them properly to minimize the risk of injuries to two fairly important members of the team. Sitting them out for Cup games or against 'weaker' teams is something I would really like to see more from Rodgers.

Under no circumstances should you move a casualty as long as there is no threat to the ABC`s of life. Airway, breathing, circulation. 

Moving the head even a small degree could cause further and possibly fatal damage.

The correct thing to do would be to tell him not to move, and stabilise his neck in it's current position. Putting something underneath the helmet is fine to do this, but the neck should be immobilized, and his head should not have been lifted

As I mentioned the only time this should be broken is if either his airway, breathing or circulation is at risk due to his current position.

So their definition would make it categorically impossible for anyone to be racist towards a white person.

So yeah...pretty mind boggling even when you know their explanation.

Above all it's not a very useful definition, because clearly when people refer to racism they include say, a group of black people beating up a white person solely for being white.

Nobody complains about a young lad not being able to shoot when he is 19, and you have Sturridge and Suarez banging in several goals a game. There's an article, think it was by Scholes in The Independent a while ago, where he critiques Sterlings shooting, and basically says the way he actually kicks the shot isn't right, if you read it you see that he is actually right, even if he's the most boring man since Phil Neville.
The lad is definitely a good player, but a lot of fans miss the vital part that he is good for his age. He's not world class yet, I don't know if he will be. With this contract business he's starting to leave a sour taste in the mouths of fans. He says it's not for money, but if you look at Sterling's career, he's obviously getting the game time, and has been in contention for trophies every season (I think) that's he's had apart from the one where he made a cameo at the end.

Looking at *all* the dealings FSG have made since they've come in anybody from the outside would think they had glued names to bingo balls, put them into the machine and whichever came out first they would buy. It's completely ridiculous the money that has been wasted on some players, I'd bet the money spent on transfer fees and wages for those flops would buy for a handful of world class players along with their wages.

This isn't the best it can get for Liverpool, I'm sorry but it just isn't. This idea that Liverpool cannot attract top players is wrong and mainly baseless. The past couple of transfer windows we have tried to get one genuine world class player and that was Sanchez. If reports are to be believed we offered him a deal to which he declined, we never went back with an improved offer at all. This was when Suarez was in the process of being sold freeing up his £220,000 wages. It was just painfully clear that the club did not really want him otherwise they could have done a number of things to persuade him. So when people say things like ""Liverpool can't attract top players"" they're basing that on one or two instances.

Lastly, most of these top players aren't arsed who they play for as long as they're paid a good wage, you just need to look at Manchester City if you don't believe me.

52% of victims of Republican violence were combatants from the Security Services, the full breakdown is here

[Of those killed by republican paramilitaries:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles#Responsibility)

* 1080 (~52%) were members/former members of the British security forces
* 723 (~35%) were civilians
* 187 (~9%) were members of republican paramilitaries
* 57 (~2.7%) were members of loyalist paramilitaries
* 11 (~0.5%) were members of the Irish security forces

&gt; The majority, if not all' loyalist arms did not come from the security forces. None of your 5 fucking links back that insinuation up...

Well my bad; there is certainly a mountain of evidence though, [including ongoing cases](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/15/uk-arms-northern-ireland-loyalist-massacre) and most recently  Ann Cadwallader's book *Lethal Allies*

&gt; Once read, Lethal Allies quickly disabuses the reader of a couple of key concepts. Ann Cadwallader constructs a crushing inventory of criminal acts perpetrated by individuals who combined membership of the security forces and loyalist paramilitary groups, utilising security force weapons, intelligence and training. They were immune from punishment even when sufficient corroborating evidence was in place to meet a test for prosecution, never mind in instances where their criminal actions were simply not investigated. Cadwallader does this by simply gathering together strands such as ballistics reports, eyewitness statements and other forensic evidence that was all available at the time to the RUC and other investigative authorities if they chose to act up on it. In many places she augments this with eye-witness accounts and other material, such as HET reports.^[source](http://sluggerotoole.com/2013/11/01/lethal-allies-this-is-not-collusion/)

You're also basically admitting that out of 650 constituencies, there are just 17 where it *might* make a difference if young people vote. That is *not* good enough and that does *not* demonstrate that the young voters in the other 633 constituencies should vote.

The benefits in having Klopp over Rodgers, namely experience, do no outweigh the benefits of keeping Rodgers. It isn't as simple as swapping one for the other, the players and management must be introduced to klopps methods and often in managerial transitions good players are forced out. There is also often a period of bad form which could easily hurt our champions league aspirations of next season. Failing to qualify twice in a row would return us, I believe, to where we were before last season. A step backwards with all the progress under Rodgers. I understand it's hard to say definitively we would not qualify next season, but I think that is just as likely with Klopp as qualifying. With Brendan I'm pretty confident in qualification for next season. To recap, I think Klopp is better, but marginally so. I think we would rewind progress by introducing a new manager. Instability is not good for us right now. Klopp has yet to prove himself in the premier league, a different challenge then the bundesliga. There is absolutely no guarantee we would do better under him, the likelihood that a change in management would be detrimental as opposed to beneficial with Klopp is too high.

1.  One of the biggest sticks used to beat Rodgers has been his evergreen optimism and tendency to over state things.  I get it, it can be grating but I think his exuberance works especially on the young players.  But I think here was a moment of truth.  During that game Villa were the better side.  They were hungrier for the ball, pressed harder and, say what you will about Sherwood, he is very good at getting players going, especially strikers.  We saw this with Adebayor.  Good luck in the final, I don't think it will be easy they are a completely different team, something supporters in this sub seem to have a hard time grasping.  

2.  This, I feel, is the greatest threat to LFC at the moment.  I've read reports that Henderson has signed a new deal, Ibe is about to as well as Skrtel. So it seems like only Sterling is the only one who seems to be on his way.  While he is an immense talent, no player is bigger than the club and I wish him well.  

3.  But the tough talking routine has worked for some of the players.  Mignolet, Henderson, Sterling (a few times I believe) all reacted positively to it so while I agree it is risky and can backfire, Balotelli comes to mind, I chalk it up to his style.  You get the good with the bad.

He was on trial at Chelsea but in the end he turned them down because he didn't like how he was treated over there. He was also on trial at Bayern where he achieved maximum points in the speed, technique and tactical tests that they run on players, something no other player had achieved before, but in the end he turned Bayern down as well. He says that he also spoke with Arsenal and Roma but decided to stay at Dinamo for now.

Another thing worth mentioning is that this season he became the youngest goal scorer in Europa League history at the age of 17 years and 157 days in a 5-1 win against Astra Giurgiu.

Would absolutely love it if he eventually joined Liverpool but my best guess would be he ends up at Barcelona like Alen Halilovic who joined them last year and is a very similar player to Coric.

If the team and particluarly Eriksen isn't playing well he can be a bit isolated - take the games against Villa and Burnley for example. He's very good at turning our good play into an end product and making sure that when we're on top and playing well, we get goals to show for it, which is something we haven't had in a long long time. 

I think that Fazio would have one of the highest points per game ratios in our team (out of the people who have played a handful of games).  His little run in the team coincided nicely with our streak of good form, which is probably pretty coincidental.

EDIT: Harry Kane's First Premier League start this season was on November the 9th v Stoke. At this point we had played 10 and were on 14 points (1.4 per game). Since then we have played an additional 23 for 43 points (1.86 per game). Comparatively, last season we managed 69 from 38, which is 1.81 per game. 

I stand corrected, there was a bit of an uptick when Kane began starting. 

EDIT2: If anyone's interested, Fazio's ppg is 1.733 from 15 starts. Of the players I had a look at, Bentaleb has our highest PPG ratio. He has played 20 games, started 18, we've won 14 of those and drawn 2 for a total of 2.2 points per game.

Anyway...

&gt;I'd be interested to know how much the PP would like to spend on research, since it appears that currently new drugs can cost a rather excruciating $5bn to develop on average.

Yes, the cost of developing a drug is eye-wateringly large, but that figure is spread out over something like 12 years of development. So that $5 billion is more like $417 million (£277 million) per year.

But just because the numbers are large it doesn't mean that the patent system is the only, or best, way to fund R&amp;D.

To give some figures:

The UK spend on pharmaceuticals is £5.8 billion per year.^1

79% of sales by market value are patented.^2

Drug prices drop by about 70% when they become generic.^3

R&amp;D expenditure only accounts for about 13% of pharmaceutical companies' revenues.^4

For a rough estimate using these figures:

Given the £5.8bn spend, the cost of patented drugs is £4.58bn.

Spending 13% of the total drug spend on R&amp;D gives a cost of £0.75bn.

A 70% reduction in drug costs by abolishing patents would save £1.99bn.

We could spend 50% more on R&amp;D (bringing the R&amp;D spend to £1.12bn) and come out with a **net saving** of £0.87 billion - that's 10% of the extra money that's going to be needed to be invested in the NHS over the coming years.

Plus, there's the impact on the research community to think about. For example, there's no incentive to withhold trial data;^5 if a drug fails (or under-performs) during trials there's no reason to keep that a secret. There's also no need to keep pre-trial research data locked away - there are no competitors to keep in the dark. Imagine is all of this ""commercially sensitive"" data was released as open data!

Of course, I should say that this plan has not been costed - these are figures I have looked up just now - but what I've presented should be an indication that it's at least not a totally stupid idea :) We also want to roll this policy out further than the UK - Pirate Parties across the EU have similar policies.

I think that's a very Western-centric view of the issues.

Colonialism was not simply limited to European countries - it had been going on for centuries in Central Asia, Africa, and East Asia as well (before the whole Japan thing happened).   Generally it was pretty limited to neighbouring states, or at least nearby states.

For whatever reason historically, though, white people ended up being 'better at it' - we had the motivation to go further afield.  Was that driven by a lack of resources? Religious fervour? Or was it simply made possible by more stable governments?  I really don't know.  But you're right in that white people are generally associated with having money in the poorer parts of the world.

I do know that white people feeling bad about being white - especially in white majority countries - is not the answer to racism.  It just encourages a sense of 'other', which leads to more racism, and is the cause of racism in non-white communities as well.

On a more personal side I think one of the good things about the UK is that when compared to other countries, we're really not that racist - I grew up in South London, and had plenty of friends of all different colours who were all simply British.   

Since growing up I've lived in the States, Australia, and Japan and Taiwan, all places which are rather horribly racist, so I've got something to compare it to. I've been in the majority and the minority and am now in a mixed-race family, and I've found that by far the majority of prejudice in the UK comes from having an accent rather than the colour of your skin.  I've had supervisors and managers from all sorts of different backgrounds in the UK, but the only ones who had foreign accents were in an Indian-owned company.

Yes, I think you're right that being white/male in a patriarchal white-majority society comes with certain advantages, but you have to remember that these advantages are the result of hundreds of years of history and society and that the people born with them didn't ask to be born with them.  You don't get to choose if you're born at all, never mind what type of family you're born into or what gender you're going to be. So a negative 'solution' that makes people feel bad for who they are is really just a case of looking for easy targets.


I think one of the strengths in our society is that we *do* try and address those advantages.  Hell, the law in Taiwan reads 'discrimination is not allowed against any citizen' (meaning it's fair game as long as they don't have a local passport).  Self-reflection and self-improvement are great things, and society is changing one funeral at a time.  Anti-racism and anti-sexism movements are great things, but we need to change the discourse to make it an inclusive one where we all adapt to each other rather than the current 'tolerate differences, you bigots!' that seems to be the main theme at present.",null,0,null,1429752514,null,0,false,0,cqlin5j,null,t3_33hoku,null,t1_cqlin5j,null,t1_cqlh5vm,null,null,null,1432549049,null,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

Anyway...

&gt;You say that you oppose TTIP, why is that? Surely not enough is known about it yet, you don't know if it's going to be anything like what the leaked documents say so why would you not choose to wait before deciding a stance on this policy?

The fact that not much is known about this agreement is one of the reasons why we oppose it. Imagine if the UK government drafted a bill behind closed doors and only gave Parliament a straight yes or no vote to adopt or reject the bill without being able to provide amendments. That's no way to legislate in a democracy, nobody would stand for it.

Similarly, we feel that treaties like this should be negotiated in the open, by default. And *certainly* not negotiated by giving industry insiders preferential access to negotiating documents. Parliamentarians and civil society have to be involved from the start

There's also the matter of ISDS. Now ISDS is not bad *per se*, if one is investing in a country that has a less than stellar record at upholding the rule of law then submitting to outside arbitration is probably a good thing to promote stable investment. But our legal systems *are* good enough. We've seen how ISDS has caused problems elsewhere (Canada and Australia spring to mind, as well as certain South American and African countries) to see that the risks outweigh any benefits.

&gt;It's safe to say you're planning on doing lots of spending, I may be missing something since I only had a skim but I don't see how you're going to be able to fund all these different things purely by taxing the rich and reducing tax evasion. Further to that I can't see a plan for reducing the deficit despite you mentioning how bad it is right now, Is this manifesto fully costed?

No, it's not costed.

We probably couldn't afford to do everything in our manifesto all at once. But let's be perfectly honest, we're not going to be part of any government. We're only standing 6 candidates (2x Manchester, 1x Salford, 1x Sheffield, 1x London, 1x Bridgend). This manifesto gives voters an understanding of what policies Pirate MPs would push for, would lobby the Government for, in Parliament. If we could use our MPs to get the Government to implement just a handful of our policies that would improve this country without breaking the bank. It's as much of a vision as it is a list of deliverables.

&gt;Could you explain the Robin Hood Tax on the stock market? I'm not quite understanding why that'd be a good thing.

I'm probably not the best person to explain this policy I'm afraid. 

&gt;With the European Union, you appear to want reforms, how do you plan on achieving that?

Good question. Clearly EU treaty change is needed, not least to sort out structural issues surrounding the Eurozone, so some sort of reform is coming down the pipeline. We work closely with our sister parties in Europe, so we would probably campaign with them (and other interested parties) to lobby for our proposed changes both in the UK Parliament and the rest of the EU. It really depends when and how the treaty revision process happens.

Personally, I'd love to see a lot more citizen participation when it comes to writing a new treaty.

&gt;With the reduction of surveillance that you wish to do, do you not worry that some cases of terrorism where communication is done purely online would rise? 

Not hugely, no. As the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe [said in a resolution today](http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News-View-EN.asp?newsid=5538&amp;lang=2&amp;cat=8): ""Mass surveillance does not appear to have contributed to the prevention of terrorist attacks, contrary to earlier assertions made by senior intelligence officials. Instead, resources that might prevent attacks are diverted to mass surveillance, leaving potentially dangerous persons free to act.""

Increasing the size of a haystack does not make it easier to find needles.

It's worth noting that we're not planning to abolish surveillance completely. Where there is reasonable suspicion of a person or group the police or security services should be able to go to a judge, lay out the prima facie evidence and get a warrant to monitor that person/group.

I'm not a terrorist, nobody should have any reasonable suspicion that I'm a terrorist so why am I spied on? There's no argument a reasonable person can make that means my right to privacy should be shat on to the extent that GCHQ is doing right now.

&gt;And finally a more personal question, are there any policies you disagree with in your manifesto?

Hmm, a couple. This latest round of our policy process reversed our position on nuclear weapons - I think that the UK should retain its nuclear deterrent but we adopted a policy to unilaterally disarm.",null,0,null,1429753185,null,0,false,0,cqlj211,null,t3_339kmh,null,t1_cqlj211,null,t1_cqjgdp2,null,null,null,1432549244,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

I agree that the article is misleading, but the fact is that the event being full of white men isn't something that's going to happen, because an event that's as you describe is something that on the whole is only going to be interesting to people who aren't white and male. At the company I used to work for, an organisation called Women in Technology used to hold talks and other events with the aim of getting more women involved in the male-dominated field of IT. But, they were always clear that men were absolutely welcome at their events. And if you actually went to one of their events, as I did (I'm male), you would see that the attendees were overwhelmingly female despite them being an extreme minority in that division of the company.

Actually, this is the starting point if we want to answer your first question. 

Everybody in life is fighting their own battles - a genderqueer woman of colour trying to find a place in the world might be jealous of a white man and how easy he has it, but that same man is jealous of her supportive family as he tries to make his way through life despite his junkie mother and absent father. 

We need to recognise that we can't assume to know what other people are going through.  Encourage kindness, encourage fairness, encourage helping, throughout society, from all genders, creeds and colours, and you'll find that the need for anti-discrimination policies drops considerably.  It starts with education, and it doesn't end. 

(I mean, how on earth do they write anti-discrimination policies?  It can all basically be summed up as 'treat all people the same'.)

As for the second one - of course the minority has to conform to the norms of the majority!  That's what the whole 'When in Rome' thing is about!  Does that mean you lose yourself and stop being who you are?  No.  But it does mean that perhaps if you live in a conservative Muslim country, maybe you stop wearing low-cut tops rather than picking fights with everyone who stares at you. 

The norms of the majority are constantly changing though.  Only a few decades ago being gay was a mental illness, now it's generally considered a normal part of life.  A hundred years ago Brits didn't eat curry once a week.  As a minority, you have to conform more to the majority than the majority does to you - say, as an immigrant, you learn the language, learn the local etiquette, learn local driving laws, try local food and take part in local culture, *but* you still retain your own culture and language and are happy to share it. 

It's the sharing that's the important thing. The majority learns through contact with minorities - whether they're LGBT or queer or foreign - that these people exist and that they're not really too different to everyone else they know. Thinking of gays as perverts slowly becomes and outdated and bigoted point of view. It's one funeral at a time.

We can argue till the cows come home about how awful it is that the burden to share is on the minority, but no amount of education or policy-making will ever change that.  It's human nature not to think outside the box you're born and raised in without a good reason.

Have a good look up and down this thread though - there's somebody asking what the hell genderqueer is, and asking why trans people are called ftm instead of just male, and all sorts of questions being asked and answers being shared.  I think it's a great sign for the future that people are willing to both learn and teach.

EDIT: Just noticed your mention of indigenous people.  Indigenous people and the issues there is a whole other kettle of fish - they've become marginalized minorities in their own countries (and this isn't a white people issue either, this has happened in Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Burma, China and Russia, that I know of off the top of my head). The practical part of me says full integration would be the easiest way to ensure an upswing in quality of living, but the bad part of that is loss of culture, language and history - but then you can't participate fully in mainstream society if you're living the traditional way. I think some sort of parallel system, where people can easily shift from traditional to mainstream society, might be a way to go about it, but even then it's not an easy question.

NZ might have done the best job with the Maori culture - Maori is an official language and all NZers are educated on the cultures and histories of the tribes, so it's not just pushed off to the side.  A lot of the 'redress' has been in the form of land transfers and the land was then used to participate in modern industries like fishing and forestry, so I think part of the solution is not expected people to follow their 'traditional' way of life but finding a way to integrate the traditional culture with a modern society.

Indigenous people have it quite hard because their own societies didn't evolve to the modern day - they were quite happy doing their thing when some outsiders arrive and BAM! the whole scene changed.

There are plenty of study into gender and transgenderism and neurobiology, which supports the idea that it's not someone who just ""thinks"" really strongly they're a man or a woman, or really really ""wants"" to be a woman or a woman, it's that their brains have neurological pathways which reflect their identified gender, resulting in discomfort in a body that doesn't match their brain and conflicting signals; gender dysphoria. 

There are also transgender women for example who identify as women but don't actually have typically female personality traits; wearing jeans and masculine clothes, doing programming and sports etc. So if they are a man who thinks he's a woman on a superficial level; why would she not be into anything we typically associate with females? Because their gender exists on a deeper level beyond ""wanting to be woman because she likes womanly things""; despite being a ""tomboy"" their brain is still male, resulting in gender dysphoria because of her female body. 

Because gender exists primarily in the brain I don't consider trans women male even if they had a penis because if you gave me a sex change by force, as well as hormone therapy, I would still be saying ""stop! I'm a male!"" and probably kill myself afterwards because dear lord, I'm a man and they've given me a womans body, and that would obviously be really horrible. So if you consider our gender to be primarily based on the neurological pathways in our brain and brain in general, and not our genitals and hormone levels, it's easy to respect trans women who say ""I'm a woman"" even if they have a penis 

Because you understand they have worked out their brain is a female brain, so they're not telling you ""I'm a man who wants to be a woman"" they're telling you ""I'm a woman in a mans body and because of how I look on the outside I've been assigned as male and lived as a male"", and similar to how you figure out your sexual orientation might be different over a period of months or years from infancy, people figure out their brain doesn't match their body and come out as transgender, and then I just see them as a man or woman who just got put in the wrong packaging at bith X amount of years ago and it's just a minor medical thing

Blatant vandalism is rolled back in minutes, but if you know how to game the wikipedia system I think you could do very well - as Contribsx and other sockpuppets have shown, with some edits remaining intact for months or years.

I don't know if mentoring was better in the past, but there are a lot of people on wikipedia who know you're allowed to edit it, but who don't know all the policies. I'd include myself in this, as I have some grasp of them, but there's an awful lot I don't know.

If you give a good reason for making an edit, then people seem reluctant to revert it. If someone does revert it, then you can probably put the information back if you wait a while (until a few more edits have been applied to the article), phrase it differently &amp;/or add a citation.

Avoid getting in edit wars, because those are never productive and that would bring attention to your edits; but, equally, other peoples' reluctance to engage in edit-wars and acrimony would work to the sock's advantage, too.

Trying to justify yourself or argue on wikipedia just isn't worth the effort - you could easily spend hours on the Talk page if you engage with a disagreement, arguing over a single sentence , and it's effort wasted because in a years time the article will have been edited by numerous other people (perhaps hundreds), so your efforts are so transient and difficult to police.

However, I personally can't see him being sold the reasons I stated above.

That being said, I think the Lovren situation could be an interesting reflection of where the club stands...

* **If Lovren is sold** ... Well, first off, I don't think it will be Rodgers who will actively sell Lovren because that would be an admission of failure. I think Rodgers wants to stick with Lovren to help him evolve and grow. That loyal (or stubborn) attitude can be both a blessing or a curse. Therefore, *if* Lovren is sold... Then I think that would be a decision made by the owners and/or the committee which may represent a slight loss of power/leverage for Rodgers (though, not necessarily in a bad 'Oh, he's about to be sacked' sort of way).
* **If we keep Lovren** ... Then Rodgers is still pretty much running the show transfer-wise and the ownership trusts him to do that.

I know it's something we seem to say every year but I think we need to give it just one more season.

Again, I know I know, we say this all the time... but for the first time in a long time, things are going well for LFC as a club. New ownership is committed and solid, they are developing for the future, we have balanced the books and - as a brand, as a club, etc. - we have started to modernise in a way that many other clubs have been doing since the inception of the Premier League.

Therefore, again, for the first time in a long time, we're finally heading in the right direction.

And I think next season is the make-or-break point for the squad and for Brendan Rodgers. I think next season is where our younger players can start to emerge, where the excuse of ""the pressure of a new city, new club, Premier League"" can be eliminated, etc. In fact, I don't think we'll see very many transfers *in* this summer because I think Rodgers feels as if he has a good core moving forward.

Therefore, the 2015-16 season is where I will put the full weight of expectation on the players and the coaches in the way many did *this* season.",null,0,null,1429770770,null,0,false,0,cqlrlnf,null,t3_33fkh3,null,t1_cqlrlnf,null,t1_cqkyz7x,null,null,null,1432553340,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null
