Sterling most likely wouldn't be the same as he would be used much more often than Sinclair ever was, as he's already good enough to get into their starting 11 IMO (and their opinion if they're willing to offer £45M for him). 

The biggest thing for me would be mental development; I know that Sterling wants to win trophies, but would he be happy winning them at a club *already* winning them when he joined? His presence in that team isn't driving them to finals and victories, but he's just a cog in the wheel fuelled by world class players around him. At Liverpool, he'd be much more influential and integral to trophies than he would be at City. 

I suppose it all comes down to what he believes he wants right now. If he wants instant success, he'd choose City. If he wants a club where he has to work hard, put in the effort and attempt at returning them to their glory days, he'd choose here.

His remark

What would be your definition of reasonable (that isn't already covered by the multitude of use of force legislation that already exists)?

My reply

If the individual has "" moved "" to strike, or indeed struck. if the officer or another member of the public is in "" direct danger of assault

His remark

Punching someone on the floor who is actively resisting arrest as well, in this particular circumstance. Do you know how difficult it is to safely get someone in to handcuffs that is putting up ANY kind of a struggle? It's going to look messy, particularly to anyone that hasn't had direct experience of that type of situation. 

Like I said I was doing something else, I'll reply here.

About twenty years ago. I was outside the Ritz Green Park on foot, 9am in the morning. A copper tried to search me. I refused, read Pace its clear on this an objective reason must be given. H e tries searching me, I refused then him and his colleague tried cuffing me, they couldn't. Simply stood my ground. Never pushed him, never threatened him. They ended up calling a van I got in, can't remember if I was cuffed before entering, it was a long time ago. If those 2 would have tried smacking me round there would have been a tear up, a proper one.

All told me and the officer learned something that day ( Taken in to Covent Garden police station ) I can't tell you what happened after that, but it was hilarious. The cops have got a weak spot, I found it

A person dying in a room full of officers, whilst they chanted monkey sounds, truly appalling (duty of care)

Firearm cops referring / colluding  when making statements during a ongoing investigation. They do, and a strike was threatened.

&gt; Like I said I was doing something else, I'll reply here.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; About twenty years ago. I was outside the Ritz Green Park on foot, 9am in the morning. A copper tried to search me. I refused, read Pace its clear on this an objective reason must be given. H e tries searching me, I refused then him and his colleague tried cuffing me, they couldn't. Simply stood my ground. Never pushed him, never threatened him. They ended up calling a van I got in, can't remember if I was cuffed before entering, it was a long time ago. If those 2 would have tried smacking me round there would have been a tear up, a proper one.

Again, this is what I'm talking about. What the fuck does your reply have to do with lolbot's remark? Lolbot asks you if you know how hard it is to handcuff a person who is resisting, and your reply to that is about how 20 years ago a Police officer tried to search you, you said no, and he took you to the Police station for it...Literally nothing to do with putting handcuffs on a resisting person because in your example you didn't even resist.

What. The. Fuck.

&gt;Ok so first up. You are NOT squatting

correct. You are in rent arrears though, meaning you can be forcibly evicted and sued for the rent you havent paid.

&gt;Regarding court costs. They are not actually that much at all 

they absolutely can be a lot, something going through civil/small claims courts can still involve lawyers.

&gt;and you are not necessarily liable to pay the other parties legal fees...

sure. And since you're not *necessarily* gonna get caught robbing a bank, there's no reason not to try it. 

&gt; Not to mention, if it gos to court, it will probably go in your favour, the landlord knows this... 

uh, what? You're saying they should immediately start withholding rent without even telling the landlord there need to be repairs done, when withholding rent is already something that you have to do very carefully in the UK to avoid legal trouble.

putting it clearly: Under UK law, there is no provision for withholding rent without giving warning to the landlord. You are not protected in *any* way if you choose to withhold the rent, and I can pretty much guarantee that if you did that here, you would be evicted and you would be paying the landlord the full rent amount anyway.

the only situation in which you can withhold rent without being at risk of eviction is given here on page 22: http://england.shelter.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/23392/ShelterGuide_GettingRepairsDone.pdf

which is clearly not OP's situation. 

&gt; Even IF a judge evicts you, its not hard to get a generous notice of months if you can show good reason, or hardship.


You can't just make up a reason and expect a judge to believe it, and you necessarily get notice longer than 2 weeks. 

&gt;.if it gets bought to court but there was a clear way to resolve the issue outside court...then again...that gos in your favour.

bhahahaha, yeah. If you go to court and tell them you started ""withholding rent"" with no notice and that you contacted the letting agent *after* you stopped paying, that's totally going to go in your favour. Complete slam dunk, no judge would possibly rule against someone who completely ignored all the procedures for getting repairs done and decided to just stop paying.

&gt;If you paid more than one months rent as deposit you are a mug...and are getting mugged off...there is no reason to charge more.

OP's deposit is almost definitely in a protection scheme and OP won't have much difficulty getting it back, when he gets evicted for following your advice.

Destitution is not having the means to provide necessities for ones self. If these people are unable to work for whatever reason, taking away their sole source of income can and does leave them unable to function in society, ergo unable exist by all practical measures.

These people are already destitute and rely wholly on welfare and goodwill of others to exist.

I think there's a lack of appreciation of how marginal some people's existence can be, especially those who are severely handicapped. While I think nothing of going out for dinner on a week day, some people have *never* eaten out at a 'middle class' restaurant. The cost of transport and the meal itself are an insurmountable hurdle for many. We don't see or hear from these people because they are marginalised in society but they are all around us in their hundreds of thousands.

It's an unfortunate truth that some people never had a chance to start off with, either through ill health or poor circumstances. Cutting their benefits which allow them to function and contribute to our society is just cruel. The implicit assumption there is that people who are on welfare have nothing to offer our society, which is demonstrably not true even if they have trouble delivering conventional goods and services.

To hell with it being unsuitable, they'll continue to use it anyway.  We'll gladly pay for the renovations... won't we? :-)

What's actually in Westminster besides the chambers and a few subsidised bars?  MPs all have their offices at Portcullis House these days.

&gt; Unless they plan on expanding the chamber it'll still be too small to seat all members

This was always the case, though.  After the war Churchill decreed that the building should be restored rather than modernised or improved; even back then eyebrows were raised at a missed opportunity to upgrade and enlarge the chamber because it was too small.

The entire set up is archaic.  Most modern Parliaments - [including Holyrood](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/173/471030676_0a7f55bd1c_z.jpg?zz=1) - have lecture theatre-esque seating arrangements.  Granted there aren't as many people seated in Holyrood, but at Westminster, there's no place for easy note taking and you're crammed cheek-for-jowl on what basically amounts to an upmarket church pew.

&gt; Of course it inevitably will be and the likely outcome will be the throwing of money at improving and upgrading the existing building

As far as i'm aware you should be eligible (under circumstance 6) as long as you satisfy the overseas work criteria. This is where you work full time overseas (I think it's 35 hours per week) with no significant break in employment and you must not exceed the permitted number of days in the UK during the overseas part of the year. As you returned in October, during the period of April-October 2014 you are allowed to spent up to 17 days working in the UK (more than 3 hours a day), or up to 52 days in the UK in general. If this is the case, then you should be considered a non-UK resident for the overseas part of the year and then a UK resident from October 2014 onwards and split-year treatment should be applied.

&gt;

&gt;__Saint Patrick's Saltire__ or __Saint Patrick's Cross__ is a red [saltire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltire) (X-shaped cross) on a white field, used to represent the [island of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland) or [Saint Patrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick), the [patron saint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patron_saint) of Ireland. In [heraldic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraldry) language, it may be [blazoned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazon) *[Argent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argent), a saltire [gules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gules)*. __Saint Patrick's Flag__ is a [flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag) composed of Saint Patrick's Saltire.

&gt;The red saltire's association with Saint Patrick dates from the 1780s, when the [Order of Saint Patrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Saint_Patrick) adopted it as an emblem. This was a British [chivalric order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalric_order) established in 1783 by [George III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom). There is some evidence that a similar saltire was occasionally used to represent Ireland before this. It is often suggested that it derives from the [arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms) of the powerful Geraldine or [FitzGerald dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FitzGerald_dynasty).   Most [Irish nationalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_nationalism) reject its use to represent Ireland as a ""British invention"". 

&gt;After its adoption by the Order of Saint Patrick, it began to be used by other institutions. When the [1800 Act of Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Union_(1800\)) joined the [Kingdom of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Ireland) with the [Kingdom of Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain), the saltire was added to the British flag to form the [Union Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Flag) still used by the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom). The saltire has occasionally served unofficially to represent [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland) and been considered less contentious than [other flags flown there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_flags_issue).

He is the man who, during the election campaign, masqueraded as the workers’ champion but he has not got the guts to help those miners. He took £700 million out of the mineworkers’ pension scheme and he has not given a penny back. No wonder they call him “dodgy Dave”. The man that went to Eton: educated beyond his intelligence.

null,false,kopmadrid,lfc99,,null,"* How do you think he performed this year?

First half of the season was shaky but he made up for it with his excellent performance in the second half of the season

* Did he meet expectations?

No, but he showed signs that he could improve if he is pressed by the No.2 (Bogdan) because when he was benched, he must have trained hard to regain his form and prove his skills to the club. 

* Where do you see him in the squad in three years?

I feel that if he continues to improve and plays as he did since the start of 2015 and as long as he doesnt become a liability to the team, he can very well be our No.1 for a few years. 

* Is Bogdán good competition for Mignolet?

Haven't seen much of him but heard that he is better than Jones. He is spoken highly of by the Bolton fans and on a free transfer we can't really complain. But given his determination to take the no.1 spot from Mignolet, I'd say this competitiveness can be crucial for both him and Mignolet to grow. 

* ""is worse than Dracula"" - Bruce Grobbelaar

Can't blame him for saying that. He said it in November 2014, and maybe at that point he was correct. But its nice to see that this criticism pushed Mignolet to improve as he did in the turn of the year. I doubt Bruce Grobbelaar will stick to his comments now if asked. 

* 'Distribution'

I feel that his distribution is not so good and can be a liability at some times and hence would hope that he works on it in the coming season. 

* Mignolet &amp; Can's good partnership

They built a strong partnership in the back 3 but since Can is going to be moving further forward in the coming season, I hope that Mignolet can forge a good relation with the CB's and especially, Lovren.... I think Lovren performed well in a few games but lacks the confidence and link-up play that is desired. A good preseason should be good for Lovren.

Verdict: 

Mignolet has improved and can only get better. I believe we should atleast give him another year. He is one of the reasons, Liverpool were in a good unbeaten run in the turn of the year and he deserves that.

We left for a bunch of different reasons. We'd been together in Australia for the last 12 years, and I'd spent the last 8 years in a fulltime job that had come to an end.

Also, my mother-in-law in England, was terminally ill and likely required care for her final days.

So I said to the good lady wife, ""We're flexible now, we can go live anywhere, do whatever we want, why don't we move to England and live near your mother before she dies?""

A few months later, we arrived in England, and then spent the next 18 months with my mother-in-law.  She got to spend good quality time with her grand children and we were there with her until the day she died.

Including a season where everything went ridiculously right until the final three games, followed by a season of just terrible luck in everything we did (some of it our own making). Lovren, Balotelli, Studge out injured, Sterling wanting to leave, lots of players playing well under par - it has been a tough year to be a supporter. A lot of people want to blame an element (the manager) and change it in order to change our fortunes. Personally I'm not convinced it would. I feel like Klopp would have the same problems and also be dealing with being a new manager in an unfamiliar league and team. Of course that is all 'what ifs'. Seems like Rodgers has used up his goodwill tokens with the fans and has probably 10 games to save his Liverpool career. It's that serious in my eyes and there are a bunch of very vocal critics around here just waiting for an early fuck up.

This season is critical in our direction as a club and so far we have started well with the new signings. I think it will only take one or two rainclouds to spoil the party again though and the fixture list is unforgiving early on. I have less hope going in to this season than last and wouldn't be surprised if Rodgers is gone before the end of the year and I've been a big supporter of him but I can't see him winning the public battle if he struggles early and the fans start getting itchy. He's pretty isolated at this stage.

However in his 16 substitute appearances (who scored doesn't provide exactly where he came in) I think you would be right to venture that a significant amount of those are out wide.
You're right to point out that Drogba came on as a sub 7 more times than Remy. But I'd be willing to wager that almost all of those occasions were when Chelsea had the lead and he came out to hold up the ball And help the midfield. But anytime we chased the game or needed a win, it was Remy who came on. If anything I think the greater number of sub appearances for Drogba demonstrates how brilliant Chelsea were rather than any kind of clear preference. 

To imply that I am stupid for not believing that Drogba was clearly second choice is silly.

&gt;Chelsea target Antonio Rudiger finds a potential transfer to Stamford Bridge ‘interesting’, according to his agent.

Blues boss Jose Mourinho is believed to be in the hunt for defensive reinforcements, and is keen on the 22-year-old German centre-back.

Rudiger’s agent Sahr Senesie confirmed that his client would be open to a move to Chelsea, but also identified his interest in joining Bundesliga outfit Wolfsburg.

Senesie told Stuttgarter Nachrichten: ‘Antonio finds Wolfsburg very interesting, but that also applies to Chelsea.

‘Nothing has been signed, though.’

With John Terry nearing the end of his career, Mourinho is thought to be scouring the market for potential replacements, and Rudiger has been identified as one for the future.

He then spent the next hour showing me tips on how to clean up the scooter and what to use and what not to use for jobs. Also gave me a big discount, £60 for my CBT and I got a free valet

When he came back he was really good. Made some big saves and looked a lot better. His distribution will always be sub - par I feel, but I noticed in some matches he was given rushed passes or bad passes which got him into trouble. You know what you get with Simon , a good shot stopper. Average in the air and that's about it.

* Did he meet expectations? I think there's a bit more left to come with him. He's a keeper good enough to push into the top 4 but that's about it for me. I would have kept Reina to compete with him but he done well enough this season when he came back. He had what I would call a decent season.


* Where do you see him in the squad in three years? If all goes well and we break the top 4 and maintain a place, I would like a better keeper if I'm being honest. I'd love him as a back up but for our style of play we need a keeper who can distribute as he's shown already he can't.


* Is Bogdán good competition for Mignolet? Not really. They are sort of the same mould although I haven't seen enough of Bogdan. They both seem to be shot stoppers. I still feel we need someone better than both of them to really push on. 


* ""is worse than Dracula"" - Bruce Grobbelaar. I think that's harsh he hasn't done too badly, he's just made some bad bad mistakes, a lot of what he does well gets looked over too.

What they are doing is the oldest political trick in the book: divide and conquer.

And the way you do that is simple: You carve out a section of society, demonise them and appeal to everyone else by enacting policies to redress the balance of an artificial divide that you invented in the first place.

Tories demonise people on benefits, Labour demonise the rich, UKIP demonise immigrants. All of these parties are wrong in different ways:

 - There will always be people on benefits who are taking the piss. I don't think anyone here has much sympathy for that; the problem is the same dragnet that deals with them also impacts people who are in genuine need. Government policies tend to be somewhat blunt instruments.
 - There aren't anywhere near as many really rich people as Labour would like us to believe, and those there are are generally able to buy their way out of most government policies that might significantly affect them. The upshot is that the last Labour government's policies had a much bigger impact on the middle class (who can't buy their way out of government idiocy) than they did on the really rich.
 - This country has had immigrants of various descriptions for decades; usually they wind up doing jobs that locals don't want to.

We've got the largest foreign aid fund in the west I think. 

Also, there's an argument that 'saving' said migrants in the med will just lead to more casualties in the future - migrants wanting to be saved. If the journey was far more perilous than it is, the number of people willing to take the risk will drop and so will casualties (as seen in Australia).

I'm from one of the most economically deprived towns in England. Had to call the police more than once - once in my own house, another in a friends. On one occasion when the police were called the intruder in question was on drink and drugs and forcibly kicked the door in; that person had a knife. On both occasions the police arrived late. In both cases I consider myself very lucky to have not come away with serious injuries. To imply that I've never been in a physical confrontation because you disagree with my post is presumptuous. 

Not everyone lives in an area where the police turn up at the drop of the hat and neighbours come to assist you. 

Your advice is dangerous. You're telling people not to even consider a backup plan. Trust in the local police force to arrive in record time (police officers who it's worth mentioning are armed with tasers, batons and CS spray for a good fucking reason). 

There's a difference between being a hero and being prepared. If someone wants to get in your house they will do. 

You're severely underestimating the number of drug-fueled maniacs in the world. House invasion is mainly to fund an addiction but not exclusively. I'm sure there are plenty of females on this forum who could reel off stories of physically abusive deranged ex-boyfriends for you.

It's not a case of if you can pay, you'll get in unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your view). if you don't meet their entry requirements they'll more than likely turn you away (except for special circumstances). It's not especially difficult to get in though, I have just got onto a MSc course at a Russell Group, I needed a 2.1 and got it - simple as that. Though I do have a thorough understanding of the subject and had already spoken to the programme leader before hand.

2. I applied for 1, as I had little doubt I wouldn't get in. I know some people who have applied for 4 or 5 though, and there is no harm in doing that. In fact I'd say it's a good idea, never put all them eggs in one basket. 

3. Per year. I've not seen any universities listing per term prices only, they might break it down into payments per term but they will almost certainly clearly display the full annual price. Though almost all UK universities allow you to pay with some level of flexibility, rather than in one lump sum.

4. They will almost certainly be aware of reputations within UK universities, and I wouldn't be surprised if they were aware of the reputations of large EU universities. Though obviously the smaller and less well known, the less they'll know. But I wouldn't at all be surprised if they google your institution. For what it's worth I went t an ex-poly and the reputation of my university was not at all a problem for my MSc university, in fact the programme leader went out of her way to say that if an applicant can display my academic capabilities and get a 2.1 (which applications should be doing regardless of academic background in terms of uni) she wouldn't ever turn down an applicant simply for doing their bachelors at a 'less reputable' university - and for what it's worth the Russell Group uni I am attending is one of the globally leading universities, with a very good reputation for my course.

5. Most universities will offer you some sort of flexibility. Most will give you a time limit though, so you can't just study indefinitely. For example my course will not allow you to take more than 3 years to complete the MSc. But obviously you would have to structure your time around when the teaching is being done on a taught masters - you couldn't really just decide to have a few months off half way through a term I wouldn't imagine.

I'm more surprised the other way around tbh, it wasn't a British History degree, you can choose your specialisms to a great extent and that level is more about depth than breadth.

But it seems so basic to be missing from primary/secondary.

That said your word 'primary' reminded me that that exists, and I might have slightly lied, because I do have the vaguest memory of hearing about Roundheads and things when I was about 7 (for whatever bloody good that was supposed to do).

Point taken that there's a lot to cover and something has to be missed out, but our whole consitutional setup derives a lot from the civil war era.  I think it might be a teeny bit more relevant and important than the time spent remembering Henry's wives and their respective means of death or divorce, or the endless self-congratulatory anecdotes about the amazing adventures of our marvellous brave explorer chaps like Drake, Cook and Livingstone (with absolutely zero regard to the darker side of our 'exploration').

You act as if everything is within a managers control when actually there are were mitigating circumstances going against us last year. There are countless examples of great managers having poor seasons. I'm not suggesting Rodgers is necessarily a great manager (although he's on his way to being one) but merely that a good manager is just one factor among many. Your determination to oversimplify and lump the blame on one man is unbelievably shortsighted. We pay 5th most in wages in the league, and wages have been shown to be an almost perfect determinant of final league standing (only managers to consistently break this trend are Mourinho, moyes and big sam), and finished one place below that whilst reaching two semi finals. This was all while we lost our two best scorers (80% of our goals), had a nightmare transfer window, and struggled with injuries. Last season was poor, but it wasn't all Rodgers' fault. In fact, in the past 6 seasons Rodgers has been the only manager capable of breaking the trend of finishing 5-8. He almost won the league with us for christ sake in a campaign which saw us playing the finest football I've seen us play in my 20 years supporting the club and took us closer to the league title than we have ever come in that period.

Sorry, didn't meant to imply that's what you meant - though reading back my comment does come across like that so sorry again!


&gt;the point was that if you have funding AND you meet all the requirements for grades etc (and have a good cover letter, for example) is there any other barrier to the application being accepted?

Obviously I don't work for an admissions team, but from all of the talks I've had with the admissions team for my MSc and my general understanding, I would say you'd be in a very good position. Meeting the requirements, a good covering letter and funding are the main concerns, a strong reference from an employer/staff member at your previous university will strengthen the application even more (and in fact, for many courses at least 2 references are a must!)

I'd say it's well worth writing a quick email to the admissions team at the university you are looking at. In my experience they the admissions teams for postgrad courses are amazingly helpful, and while they might not be able to say for certain you'll get a place they'll certainly give you a very good idea, which would put your mind at ease if you want to focus on just the one university. 

If the university happens to be the Uni of Manchester by any chance then I'd be happy to tell you a bit more about the application process (though to be honest I've mentioned most of it already!)

Raheem Sterling is the perfect example and whether or not he's being sold, he has already justified academy signings. We also have a tremendous crop of highly talented youngsters coming out now. 

Right now we have a few of our academy players holding different squad roles.

1. Starters - Sterling. Having started for all of our games when available, golden boy Sterling have the potential to reach the very top. Although it looks he might be leaving, the money netted from the sale of Raheem (40 - 50 mil irregardless of the QPR clause) has already justified developing a strong academy and extended youth scouting. 

2. Rotational/ Competing for first team place - Ibe, Flanno.
It is unfortunate that flannagan has been injured for the whole of 14/15 but we can still see the tremendous value and potential that Ibe and Flanno have brought.  Although they are young and with much more development to go, they've already saved the club many pounds.

3. Backup - Wisdom, Ward, Ilori, Texeira
At the moment, these players are competing for a spot on the bench. These youth players(most of them bought at a low price) provide competition and will either rise up to the challenge like Sterling did or net us a small sum of money like Suso, Nemeth and Conor Coady. 
*I feel that Ilori and Texeira might have moved to group 2 if they weren't unlucky with persistent injuries.

4. Outstanding talent ready to push for a rotating or back up position - Rossiter, Wilson, Chirivella, Ojo, Sinclair, Kent, Canos, Philips, Branagan. 

That's a huge list and I haven't included the recent signings that we've made! Not to mention there's the u18 group and u16 group as well so it definitely seems like our scouts and academy are doing the right things churning and developing talents. 

They are homegrown (mostly) so it helps us avoid the situation of signing english to fill the quota. They also play the same formations and philosophy that the first team play which helps slotting in seamlessly.The money saved from buying a first team player or rotational player can let us sign bigger players.
We've also seen first hand how a golden generation can help propel clubs like Manchester United, Southampton and Barcelona.

Personally applaud his U Turn, why have a mind at all if you never change it. However, our government are committed to cutting in-work benefits (tax credits or elements of universal benefit?) and this seems likely to be disastrous for those 'hard working families' exclusively.

Just as the Union Jack is firmly tied to empire.

The definition of 'connotation' is the perceptions *people* have when they see an image e.g. the rebel flag. I don't deny that it has a racist connotation; of course it does. My aim is to counteract that and demonstrate that it isn't as simple as that.

&gt; Slavery was the cardinal reason for the civil war, without slavery the war would not have occurred

Entirely true, and I will give up that specific point. But my point still stands that the flag is not necessarily about that anymore.

I wonder to what extent this is actually a like-for-like tradeoff. 

Moreover:

Rent is paid monthly, when dealing with agencies, so in reality they are giving the agency plenty of notice.

No judge is going to rule that having a pipe leak into a cupboard and a toilet that uses your hot water is acceptable for the tenant.

While the home is no where near the threshold for ""not fit for human habitation""
As they did not have these faults implicitly described to them, and a prospective tenant would reasonably assume that the plumbing was in order unless otherwise informed to the contrary, it can be argued that an accurate description of the property was not given, and thus any contract entered into was not done so in good faith on all parties, or with all facts apparent.

All contracts in the UK must be fair and reasonable, otherwise they are not worth the paper they are written on.

Honestly, I used to be all for sustainability until I started reading some counter-arguments from various scientists + intellectuals and now I think it's a mistake.  

First off - we've never had sustainability - unless you count living in disease and poverty.  I guess nature in the absence of man is the closest you could get to the ideal of a sustainable system, but what is that nature like? It's red in tooth and claw. It's a balance between survival and death so that organisms are constantly perched on the cusp of survivability.  (And if they aren't, then they will proliferate without bound until crashing.)

The only way we've managed to make things better for ourselves is through *progress*.  Through never looking back and striving to find more gains.  And if we are to survive ecological disaster we will need to make yet more progress.  As always, it's science and technology which will solve these problems - not crippling our economies and trying to return to a pipe-dream of sustainable living.

Yes, I know that my lengthy reply will just get downvoted and I'm liable to just get insulted.  It's the way it always it is when arguing against the self-righteous.  Still, if you'd like to know more, then take a look at [this video by Oxford professor David Deutsch](http://www.ted.com/talks/david_deutsch_on_our_place_in_the_cosmos?language=en).

Most people here I know transferred, was offered a similar job at a different country (usually 5+ years experience) or the person used a headhunter to find a job for them. In your case, if you want to move there at a younger age and don't have a whole lot of experience or ease in transferring, use a headhunter. It's costly but they find you great jobs and the higher salary you end up with spreads out the costs over time.

Those weren't really the two options.

The extreme left are much more dangerous than simply being ""easily offended"". They can, in fact, be [just as dangerous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_theory) as the extreme right. Arguably, they are *more dangerous* right now, because of the state of society, and the position(s) of influence they find themselves in.

As I mentioned earlier, the left are deeply rooted in academia; leftist views being much more prominent than right. But the problem is much deeper than that. These leftist views of feminism and social justice purport to be founded upon altruism, empathy, consideration and tolerance, but in actuality they call for policing, restrictions, censorship; a cracking down on what can/can't be said/done.

George Carlin said:

&gt;[“Political correctness is America's newest form of intolerance, and it is especially pernicious because it comes disguised as tolerance. It presents itself as fairness, yet attempts to restrict and control people's language with strict codes and rigid rules. I'm not sure that's the way to fight discrimination. I'm not sure silencing people or forcing them to alter their speech is the best method for solving problems that go much deeper than speech.”](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1341459-political-correctness-is-america-s-newest-form-of-intolerance-and-it)

I'd like to see him play more games but I think this season, he will be either playing as a substitute for most of the season or we'll sell him/loan him out.

Like I said, he's developed into a decent full back, but I think he should be played more on the wings in midfield. He does well to track back but he can really cause problems further up the pitch. I remember seeing a segment in an interview (maybe around a year or so ago) where he said he was working on becoming a free kick taker and taking hints from Whittingham (our current set piece taker).

Should be intelligence led I would think.

I would suggest taking away some of the focus on *what* you did in the police and try to refocus it on why it's useful in the role your applying for. For example you must have done a lot of admin and data entry work - that's going to be very applicable to some of the jobs. Similarly in working well with people, communications skills etc.

If you are applying for some jobs in similar categories then considering tailoring 3 or 4 CVs just for those jobs. Cut some of the work experience (there is a lot on there for an entry level position) and instead put in a really focussed paragraph summarising your skills. Use your work experience to back that up.

Finally I think generally part time jobs are tougher to find that full time, keep at it and you'll get something in the end.

FYI I do a lot of recruiting although typically for specialised positions where something more similar to your current CV would be more normal - so take my advice with a grain of salt.

One more thing - if you can figure out a way to speak to someone face to face or over the phone it will give you a huge edge.

Bamford would be fantastic as a short term understudy to Benteke, but I wouldn't want him to be the main strike force (he isn't proven in the prem yet....). Would Kozak, Bamford, Gabby, and Robinson be good enough if Benteke goes on deadline day? The answer is probably no... Though Bamford played well in the Championship last year and has a lot to prove in the Prem, so he could turn out fantastically. I know this is going to be unpopular on this sub, but perhaps we could loan in Bamford and then if Benteke goes on deadline day, we could quikly use the funds to sign or loan in Adebayor as a short term replacement... Put him on a 2 year deal maximum or something.


Basically what I am trying to say is that a Bamford loan makes sense if Benteke stays, but it also makes sense if Liverpool swoop in on deadline day with 32.5 million (which Villa must accept) and then Benteke decides to go as we could make a deal with Tottenham to sign Adebayor for cheap (and get him off their hands). Even better if we could get him on loan.... Sigh.

Your CV doesn't really say any of this. I'd be wondering why you were applying to work in a shop if you used to work for the police. My first thought would be that maybe you got the sack, or left in disgrace. It's not a fair first impression at all, but most hiring managers and recruiters pretty much take things at face value.

If i were you I'd change the introduction to better reflect your current position. Something like ""I am a mature student currently studying Business Management, looking to stay in the workforce throughout my studies. I am used to working in high-pressure environments and balancing varied workloads; skills which would enable me to work efficiently in a part-time position while I obtain my degree.""

Or something. I do some CV writing but it's 1.30am and I've had a gin and tonic ;) The best policy is often to be very transparent about your situation; hiring managers and the like really don't like having to read between the lines.

The history of the flag isn't as black and white as these outrage articles would have you think. The argument is that the currently popular 'Confederate flag' was never an official standard of the Confederate States of America. It was the personal battle flag of General Lee, one of the rare Confederates to oppose slavery, going out of his way to free and educate them during and after the war.

That's why it's named the 'rebel flag'. Not as a rebellion against the US, but pretty much everything. It's the official flag of absolutely nothing that petitions for the freedom of everything, representing the best of southern US culture.

For income, any salary **from you or your partner** can be counted towards the £18,600 requirement, *provided that your partner has been in salaried employment for the previous six months*. If their rate of pay has changed at any point in the previous six months, they'll base their decision on the lowest annual rate during that time period (or a temporary rate multiplied to achieve a comparative annual rate). You can also count any cash earnings you have above £16,000, plus any income from property, for example.

So if your partner has been in salaried employment for the past six months and makes more than £18,600, you're good. If not, then perhaps a Tier 2 is the best way to go. I work with a girl who's going through that right now. Unfortunately, the chances of getting a Tier 2 sponsored for most people right now are about as good as winning Willy Wonka's golden ticket.

Good luck, and use /r/IWantOut if you want more detailed information.

EDIT: It's also possible for your partner's earnings to be counted if they've been in a new job for less than six months that pays the minimum £18,600 needed, provided that over the previous 12 months they have earned, on average, a gross annual salary equivalent to £18,600.

Mob rule is when the government is scared to make decisions based on how the loud voices will react ie the intellectuals that were protesting the flag being brought down. Those recommendations were made based on fear of the Unionist reaction, because historically Unionism hasn't been too keen on Catholics receiving equal treatment.


&gt; So according to you this is about dismantling the system? IE equality considerations are just a front for a destructive republican agenda. Says it all.


What did you think the republicans were doing? Of course they're fighting for a United Ireland which would involve dismantling the overseeing foreign government. It's not a front for a destructive agenda, equality should be maintained while we all go about our political aspirations. 


&gt; So am I, without any need for a passport from the Republic. Either way, doesn't change the jurisdiction we live &amp; work in.


What? I just pointed out how a foreigner can live and work here too, that doesn't define nationality? 


&gt; No one can do that when it's the official name. Here's an explanatory diagram that should help:



Hahahahaha are you saying that 'the North' isn't an official term? Seeing as it is literally located in the North of Ireland? That geographically accurate term is politically charged but the recognised state name isn't? LMFAO


&gt; Except that using arguments just as applicable to other, nationalist councils obviously invites the spotlight on them. Again you bring up false equivalence - the tricolour in NI is equivalent to the union flag in the Republic. Neither are equivalent to displaying the official state flag in either jurisdiction.


The decision to take the flag down was because the flag being up isolates the Nationalists. Not having a flag up isolates nobody. You can't say you're isolated because a council isn't flying your flag, seeing as it isn't flying anyone's flag? That's imposing the flag on people.",null,0,null,1436067967,null,0,false,0,cssjne8,null,t3_3bs0kt,null,t1_cssjne8,null,t1_csrvkso,null,null,null,1437594359,null,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1,null

So most weren't really being invaded and by that definition the U.S. has ""invaded"" Britain as it has bases there.

""Britain"" was in quotes because they were including countries ""invaded"" by England, when it was a country with its own Army. Britain has only existed as a political entity since England's union with Scotland in 1707.

""By"" was in quotes because Britain itself is included on the map.

On economy, I would count as straight Orange Book, except that I don't particularly disapprove of state services, and agree that the evidence is that the NHS efficiently crowds out some bad possibilities that happen when healthcare is totally free-marketized. I balk at all kinds of subsidy and tariff, and support Pigouvian and land value taxes and oppose income or profits taxes.

There is another dimension that this doesn't really pick up, the propensity towards civil liberties. For example, a person can oppose antidiscrimination laws on the grounds of freedoms of association, and that's something that doesn't really show up on the radar. And I'm not so pleased about gun restrictions either, but that too is hard to characterize.

The Tories are horrible because of how little they care about that last category, but to even talk about it is unique to the LibDems, so once there's a voice for civil liberties, I don't see a clear superior between LD/Con and LD/Lab.

null,false,skunkd,,Belfast,null,"&gt;Mob rule is when the government is scared to make decisions based on how the loud voices will react ie the intellectuals that were protesting the flag being brought down. Those recommendations were made based on fear of the Unionist reaction, because historically Unionism hasn't been too keen on Catholics receiving equal treatment.

Historically? The CRC take into consideration the here and now. Your prejudiced views on unionists doesn't come into it.

So when the CRC reach a recommendation, that more people in the city see the flag being displayed as important than those who actively want it's removal, you think they should be overruled because your opinion matters more. That's the gist of your argument.

&gt; So according to you this is about dismantling the system? IE equality considerations are just a front for a destructive republican agenda. Says it all.

Trying to remove legitimate emblems of state is destructive, no real room for argument there. 

&gt;What? I just pointed out how a foreigner can live and work here too, that doesn't define nationality? 

Someone born &amp; bred here is not the same thing as a foreigner coming here. A passport is not the exclusive qualification for nationality.

&gt;Hahahahaha are you saying that 'the North' isn't an official term? 

Yes.

&gt;Seeing as it is literally located in the North of Ireland? 

And? We're located in the Atlantic too but Atlantic islands isn't an official term.

&gt;That geographically accurate term is politically charged but the recognised state name isn't? LMFAO

Laughing at clear fact? Whatever you're into.

&gt;The decision to take the flag down was because the flag being up isolates the Nationalists. 

No it does not. It gets the back up of extremely easily offended people such as yourself.

&gt;Not having a flag up isolates nobody.

The designated days policy implies it's not unreasonable to display the state flag. Your argument advocates total removal and is unrealistic.

&gt;That's imposing the flag on people.

And they say loyalists are easily offended...

That's the gist of your argument.



I hate to bring petty insults into a discussion but do even think about what you're typing before you type it? The decision wasn't made because they were worried how the majority would react, they made the recommendation because the ones who want it kept up are the ones who are going to riot? I'm a little shocked to be honest with you that you would even think that what you said was actually solid reasoning, why would they be worried about the people who agree with the decision? They're not causing any trouble?


&gt; Trying to remove legitimate emblems of state is destructive, no real room for argument there.


The Nazi flag was also a legitimate emblem of state. Next point;



&gt; Someone born &amp; bred here is not the same thing as a foreigner coming here. A passport is not the exclusive qualification for nationality.



Hold up there tiger, you said I wan't Irish because I paid taxes to the UK and used the NHS etc etc. I've pointed out how foreigners also do that, and you respond it's not the same because they weren't born and bred here? That's why they're foreigners, that's the point I'm making. What's at hand is what makes me Irish, and the GFA allows to me to posses an Irish passport.



&gt; A passport is not the exclusive qualification for nationality.


Not according to the UN I'm afraid. There's a reason you're not allowed a Spanish passport, you're not Spanish. There's a reason I'm allowed an Irish passport, because I'm Irish.



&gt;Hahahahaha are you saying that 'the North' isn't an official term?

&gt;&gt;Yes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Seeing as it is literally located in the North of Ireland?

&gt;&gt;&gt;And? We're located in the Atlantic too but Atlantic islands isn't an official term.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That geographically accurate term is politically charged but the recognised state name isn't? LMFAO


&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Laughing at clear fact? Whatever you're into.



Again what really happened is completely different. Your little diagram there was to prove that saying the name 'Northern Ireland' isn't politically charged because that's the official name? Well the region the North is the official area of something that's North of something else, and is the North then. The North of Ireland is completely located *in the North of Ireland*. So why is one politically charged and the other not? They're both the correct term after all? 


&gt; No it does not. It gets the back up of extremely easily offended people such as yourself.


How come I'm 'offended' by making my case about why the flag should come down, but you're not 'offended' because it got taken down? 



&gt; The designated days policy implies it's not unreasonable to display the state flag. Your argument advocates total removal and is unrealistic. 


Why is it unrealistic? If the council passed that motion then it would happen? The only reason they have designated days was because it offered as a compromise to the loyalists so that they wouldn't explode at the thought of Catholics being considered. The Sinn Fein motion brought down the flag entirely and Alliance agreed. The loyalists were the ones who wrangled designated days. It is absolutely realistic.


&gt; Anyway the net result means more councils now have the flag up 365 days a year, with the majority rules argument you've effectively used to explain the flag not being used in nat councils. I'm sure you're ecstatic with that.


I couldn't care less tbh. What I care about is walking through Belfast every day and having to look at a flag on my city hall that alienates me and half of the population, just because loyalists insist on it. You never answered my question over why you have to have it 365 days a year when so many other councils don't by the way.

Obviously there are many exceptions, and people are moving out later and later as housing becomes less affordable. I'm 22 and live alone but many of my friends still live with their parents. 

Nonetheless, family bonds are strong. Maybe less so than what you're used to, but generally people put their family before friends.

You didn't appear to be aware of the existence of the CRC's stance prior to me pointing it out to you. Now you know about it you're telling me how they reached their conclusion. 

Instant expert here if ever there was one.

&gt;The Nazi flag was also a legitimate emblem of state. Next point;

Offended much?

&gt;Hold up there tiger, you said I wan't Irish because I paid taxes to the UK and used the NHS etc etc.

Nope, wrong again.

I said you can say you don't recognise the state you live in all you like, but it doesn't change the reality. That hasn't changed during any of your wandering arguments on why you can ignore real life.

&gt;and the GFA allows to me to posses an Irish passport.

You could possess an RoI passport long before the GFA.

&gt;&gt; A passport is not the exclusive qualification for nationality.

&gt;Not according to the UN I'm afraid.

Quote.

&gt;There's a reason you're not allowed a Spanish passport, you're not Spanish. There's a reason I'm allowed an Irish passport, because I'm Irish.

That doesn't disprove the fact there are other ways of identifying people as British nationals. Birth being one.

&gt;Again what really happened is completely different. You're literal diagram there was to prove that saying the name 'Northern Ireland' isn't politically charged because that's the official name? Well the region the official area of something that's North of something else, is the North then. The North of Ireland is completely located *in the North of Ireland*. 

You cannot be serious with that argument?

&gt; No it does not. It gets the back up of extremely easily offended people such as yourself.

It's a political statement - you just admitted to using it for political reasons! As opposed to calling it by officially recognised title...

&gt;How come I'm 'offended' by making my case about why the flag should come down, but you're not 'offended' because it got taken down? 

Because I'm not offended by designated days, which is the current policy in a handful of councils only. I don't know why other councils haven't been asked to do the same though. 

You are offended because you've been stating over and over how the state flag being flown is connected to years of British oppression of nationalists!

&gt;Why is it unrealistic? 

Show us all the capital cities in the world where the state flag doesn't fly.

&gt;The only reason they have designated days was because it offered as a compromise to the loyalists so that they wouldn't explode at the thought of Catholics being considered. 

Uhuh. Having read through a list of breathless arguments on how your view isn't getting equal treatment or something I'm not sure who's exploding at the minute.

&gt;The Sinn Fein motion brought down the flag entirely and Alliance agreed. 

?

&gt;I couldn't care less tbh. 

I think it's been established how self centred you are when it comes to your political views.

&gt;What I care about is walking through Belfast every day and having to look at a flag on my city hall that alienates me and half of the population, 

You are blind to the fact that not all nationalists believe the state flag on public buildings 'alienates' them. Seriously, get over yourself.

&gt;You never answered my question over why you have to have it 365 days a year when so many other councils don't by the way. 

I don't really mind, but I would guess it's important to other unionists as Belfast is our capital city and other UK capitals have our flag flying. Civic pride. Also the reason that protests were NI wide.

That doesn't mean we just dump our family on the streets and forget about them. It's getting less and less affordable for people to find their own home, so many young adults are living longer with their parents. Parents and young adults alike would like them to be able to move out, and they will as soon as they can, but the family support them when they need support.

After moving out, most young people stay close to their parents, visiting probably a couple of times a week, but obviously if you choose to move further away that will be less easy. Extended families will be visited on Christmas and birthdays and so on, and some people are closer to their extended families than others, but when a family spend all their time living in each other's pockets, we find it a bit odd. We tend to value independence.

I think in general, young adults want to move out and find their independence more so than their parents want them to leave, but there are rare cases where parents are sick of having the kids living with them, and encourage them to leave sooner than they'd like.",null,0,null,1436082311,null,0,false,0,csso3g7,null,t3_3c6dst,null,t1_csso3g7,null,t3_3c6dst,null,null,null,1437597920,null,7,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,7,null

null,false,Timothy_Claypole,null,null,null,"OK so you had a job you could do without any qualifications, in a specialist close-knit industry, and you managed to have this for 15 years. You did something bad and you lost your job and now you are possibly untouchable in the industry and you are struggling to get even basic work because, possibly, they follow up on your last job. 

You need a way to show you are a changed person and not someone who they think is just on the way down and not worth touching.

You need to show you can be given some responsibilities without ripping someone off or committing fraud. 

Volunteering may be a way to show this. Are there any charity shops you can spend some time volunteering with? The point is to get you looking trustworthy faster.

You say you applied for lots of jobs in March. What since then? You need to keep applying for jobs. Don't stop. Make job applying your *current* job, as it were.

Given you can possibly never work in your old industry again, your medium term goal could be to get some qualifications so you can go do something else. Consider evening classes, heck maybe even the OU (which starts at A level standard and works its way up) but I have no idea on help with fees. Do check this out.

You correctly identify that you just need *something* so building trust and making yourself look trustworthy again has to be the first aim.

I know you will hear this from others but please remember to avoid:

* fibbing to get a job
* loan sharks (Wonga et al included)
* dodgy looking job schemes that might rip you off

Shortly put it sounds like the copiers are in breach of contract. 

The small claims limit is £3000 in Scotland so it would be possible for you to bring a claim to court yourself. It's designed to be easy for people to do it without lawyers. However, if the case is defended you'd need to send someone to the procedural hearings and the Proof (What we call a trial in a civil case here). 

There is some risk that if you lost an order for expenses could be made against you but the maximum is normally 10% of the value the claim , so £200 here.  

One warning, you only have 5 years from the breach to sue, or the case becomes time barred. 

Finally, strange as it may seem, you should also check what Canadian law says, because if the situations were reversed Scottish Law would let you sue the company in the Scottish Courts even though they were not based here (this is to make it easy for consumers to sue corporations even when they are based elsewhere, so people don't have to worry about litigating in a foreign jurisdiction).

The ones best suited to sensitive skin include 4% niacinamide/ nicotinamide (Nicam), 15%/ 20% azelaic acid (Finacea/ Skinoren) or adapalene (Differin), IMO don't ask about benzoyl peroxide which is vicious stuff.

Research your local NHS Trust's formulary (what should be prescribed for acne) and referral policy. GPs absolutely CAN refer to a hospital dermatologist for acne, but usually for severe, not responding to the standard treatments, causing scarring or affecting mental wellbeing. Pharmacists may be able to advise you on formulary and certainly on the likelihood of any side effects. If you are not satisfied with your treatment you have the right to ask for a different doctor in the same practice, or to switch practices entirely.

Routine: check out our Wiki and the sidebar. Particularly the beginners routine, article on sun protection, mega review threads, ingredients Wiki (SAP derivative of vitamin C, niacinamide, vitamin A derivatives/ retinoids). Are you shaving? Products and techniques here are relevant.

Various antibiotics and many topicals for acne are photosensitising (increase sun damage) including retinoids and tetracycline, so get a broad spectrum sunscreen in place before you consult your family doctor.

SPF 15 is the minimum recommended for daily use whenever the UV index is 3+. This is April onwards in the UK, even many cloudy and rainy days surprisingly (see Met Office website, or download an app if you have a smartphone). If you use photosensitising drugs or topicals SPF 30+ would be advisable.

Also review your diet and lifestyle choices, ensure you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations.

Ok then, how did they reach their conclusion? 


&gt; Offended much?


Can't really respond to this one, it's hardly cutting edge debate. 


&gt; I said you can say you don't recognise the state you live in all you like, but it doesn't change the reality. That hasn't changed during any of your wandering arguments on why you can ignore real life.


""Hair splitting. You pay your taxes to the exchequer, receive treatment from the NHS and vote at Westminster and a devolved administration. Whatever the citizenship, we're all resident in the UK and signed up to honouring that. Our flag is the union flag."" - /u/skunkd. What you said here is that because I pay taxes to the Queen that means the Union Flag is my flag. Either just admit you were wrong with this or stop trying to defend it as if it was anything else. You need to find a new reason as to why I'm not Irish and to why the Union Flag is my flag, because this one is null and void. 


&gt;You could possess an RoI passport long before the GFA


One of the biggest issues at hand during GFA talks was the South dropping its constitutional claim to the North, which brought into dispute Northerner's rights to an Irish passport so amendments were made to still allow this right. So it is since the GFA that I still have this right.


&gt; That doesn't disprove the fact there are other ways of identifying people as British nationals. Birth being one.


There are ways to become British *citizens* yes, which would then allow you a British passport as a British citizen. It's wholly irrelevant to my point that I'm Irish because of my passport. So if you could address that one instead that would be great. 


&gt; You cannot be serious with that argument?


Again not much I can do except ask you to maybe expand on it a bit? 


&gt; It's a political statement - you just admitted to using it for political reasons! As opposed to calling it by officially recognised title...


Have you been watching the story about the confederate flag in the US? How many people calling the South of the USA 'the South', because that's literally what it is? Official name, official geographical location, why is one more politically charged than another? Stop dancing around it.


&gt; Because I'm not offended by designated days, which is the current policy in a handful of councils only. I don't know why other councils haven't been asked to do the same though.
You are offended because you've been stating over and over how the state flag being flown is connected to years of British oppression of nationalists!


I'm not offended by designated days, this whole debate was because I'm in favor of the flag being taken down? Aren't you the one with the problem with it? And you just pointed out loads of others councils have started flying 365 days a year, why aren't you wondering about those councils instead of wondering about Nationalist councils not flying anything? 


&gt; Show us all the capital cities in the world where the state flag doesn't fly.


Unless you can prove that a city being a capital is a necessary criteria, then the Basque region has no Spanish flags on any of its government buildings. Plus why would you say capital? It was the Union flag being flown, Belfast isn't the capital of the United Kingdom?


&gt; Uhuh. Having read through a list of breathless arguments on how your view isn't getting equal treatment or something I'm not sure who's exploding at the minute.


Oh you're not sure are you? Do you actually have a counter point or you satisfied with not being sure?


&gt; ?


That would be an ecumenical matter.


&gt; I think it's been established how self centred you are when it comes to your political views.


Is that what you think? Totally mind blowing news that the loyalist thinks critically about the republican if you ask me. I don't care about your personal views of me.


&gt; You are blind to the fact that not all nationalists believe the state flag on public buildings 'alienates' them. Seriously, get over yourself.


Well you can't provide stats on that and I can't either, but I will let you know that I have met tons and tons of Protestants in Queens who don't care at all and tons and tons of Catholics who do. Our own biased viewpoints on this don't mean much without facts.


&gt; I don't really mind, but I would guess it's important to other unionists as Belfast is our capital city and other UK capitals have our flag flying. Civic pride. Also the reason that protests were NI wide.

IMO Emre is much, much better than Lucas was at the same age. I think he will do a similar job at breaking up attacks yet he offers SO much more going forward.

Sorry that drops aren't 100%, however that wasn't the RPG we wanted to make. Randomness is built into the system - we didn't want every person to have every drop, using the same teams, so as you play through the game you get a random set of characters, and the ability to get hold of (almost, outside the fan area) every other character for free. 

""Time-delays for playing? Check""

Not sure what game you're playing. We don't have, or ever have had, any sort of time delay mechanic.


""Unskippable video ads between levels? Check.""

These are removable if you financially support the game. Games cost money to make and continue to support, so (sadly) adverts were necessary. We ran the game for over a year and a half without ads, however they became necessary to keep the game running. A skippable ad gets us around 0.2c each I believe, sadly not enough to cover the live support we provide for the game. 


""Real money the only way to get a greater than 0.00001% chance of some items?""

Laughably incorrect. Not sure if you're playing the correct game.


""Notification spam? Check.""

We send out a notification once every few days. Usually once a week, sometimes twice. And you can turn them off very easily, If you opt in for notifications, you'll get them.


""We Whovians deserve a game that treats us better than this.""

Then I strongly suggest you design a game, raise money, persuade the BBC to let you make a Doctor Who game and go make one, just as I did =) I can put you in touch with the right people, if you would like. 

And, just to point out the obvious, Legacy is the highest rated, most critically acclaimed Doctor Who game in the history of the show and (unlike every other DW game) strives to include not just all the Doctors, but a massive amount of companions as well. I'm very sorry that it's not up to your high standards, and I hope one day you return and give the game another shot.

And that adds any weight to your argument in what way? Surrounding yourself with Liverpool fans, either, doesnt give any sort of certificate to your opinion. Likewise with mine, they are just those, opinions. Currently, you seem to be trying out every trick to prove your opinion is somehow superior. Which I have no idea why. You began the rambling by saying you are a fan for 20 years. So what? Does that change the 6-1? Or the loss to Palace year on year? In your head it might.

Haha this is ridiculous. ""Organic"". 

&gt; Your arguments are ridiculous because they make no sense.

Your bullshit reasoning as to why we must place no blame on Rodgers makes sense? It's about as weak as our ability to score last year. 

&gt;  said Rodgers was NOT THE ONLY FACTOR at play this season.

Re-read. I've already said he isnt the entire problem. He is part of it in a huge way, and on pitch, the buck will stop with the manager. The players will be analyzed, but the questions about team performance will end at one man alone. 

&gt;Your vendetta against Rodgers is embarrassing

So's your need to defend him vehemently. That's probably more embarrassing seeing what we've done last year out on the pitch, getting beat by mighty Tactics Tim, Stevie Bruce etc. 

&gt; last season wasn't as poor as you make out

Keep that on repeat in a dark room while rocking yourself in a chair. It might change things. Despite the ownership saying that 4th was minimum and they are disappointed, to you it looks perfectly fine. That's why all the changes this term, that's why Brendan, as most realistic folks agree, is on borrowed time. 

&gt; Just get behind the manager for fucks sake.

Getting behind a manager and calling him out for his results can actually happen together! That may be news to most of this sub who are of the attitude with him or against him. 

&gt; Why are you even a 'fan' if you can't seem to find joy in supporting the team?

Why are you a fan if you want to support one single individual and not think about the club as a whole? Are you a fan because of Brendan? I am really starting to think so. Even at the clubs expense, Rodgers stays. 

&gt; What's with the negativity? Seriously 

Negativity? How about a dose of reality that seems to be sorely lacking here? How about something different, like you know, different opinions? An alternate view on things.

I didn't do much reading around until 3rd/4th year, as it wouldn't have made that much of a difference in 1st/2nd year exams. Not to say it wouldn't have helped, but I didn't. In later years, the lecturers will commonly be lecturing directly on their research area, so having a few examples from the lit to throw in looks good, and might boost your marks. For us, some lecturers required outside reading for full marks, others explicitly didn't, so finding out about that is handy.

Past papers, and developing exam technique is crucial. There's no point writing a full page for a 4 mark answer, and you'll need more than a few lines for a 10 mark answer. Some lecturers will recycling old questions over and over again. You can't rely on this fully, but if he's asked questions from the same pool of 4/5 for the past 10 years, it's fairly likely that won't change. Still know the rest of the course, but having answers developed for these will save you time in the exam.

Try to thoroughly understand the underlying concepts of things, it's a far more effective way to learn, you can then apply your understanding to questions. This will also help you develop better answers.

I'm another one who couldn't work in the library, I much preferred to work from home, where there's a kettle and all my food. The trick is finding somewhere you can work comfortably and effectively.

Remember to actually take breaks and stuff. If you just work for 10/12 hours flat, you'll burn out and waste your time. Find a system that works for you, but when you're working, work, try to get in the zone and knuckle down. A few hours of quality work is much more effective than a day's worth of fucking around.

As above, do the work. In STEM, coursework, in whatever form it takes (lab reports, essays, etc.) is a relatively easy way to boost your marks, and take pressure off the exams.

If you have small group tutorials, go to these, and do the work. As you'll be going through this in a group of 5/6 with an academic, they're excellent ways to highlight any misunderstandings.

There you will meet people, and then go on to live with them (this is what the vast majority of people do). So yeah typically you will be in halls of residence in 1st year and live in a shared house in second and third year. I would highly recommend not planning on staying in halls past first year.

I would also highly recommend living in Lenton - although most likely this will happen naturally. The vast majority of students live there, and that's where you'll want to be.

As for costs, for halls you can find out on the UoN website. To live in Lenton it's anywhere between £70-£120 per week. The ones on the lower end leave quite a bit to be desired, the ones on the higher end are almost too nice...I'd say you could live comfortably off ~93 a week (including bills), although you could live off less if you wanted.

For career criminals (rather than opportunists) that's more normal than you'd think!

Also they may be stealing to satisfy an urge to buy expensive things like clothes.

If he doesn't get us into the top four, or at least is able to show that the squad is making big strives to reach it the season after the coming one, he'll get sacked.

What's encouraging about this is that this is Rodgers' signing. The problem with evaluating what Rodgers has done at the club is that it hasn't been clear what he is (or isn't) responsible for. This man is appearently hand picked by Rodgers and seems to want to play the same kind of football. Yes man or not, this is the man Rodgers picked. So if everything goes to hell, we'll know that Rodgers' ideas aren't right for the club and try to re-boot under a new manager (probably Klopp if he's available). And if everything goes well, or at least if we manage to play close to how we played in 13/14, Rodgers has proven that he does know how to manage a squad.

So this guy has two things going for him: he wants to play the same type of football as Rodgers does, and he has a lot of coaching experience. He's older than Rodgers and has been around for a long time. He seems like great material for assistant manager.

Edgy? I dont know if they are that things, but one thing I do know is they seem to touch several nerves as soon as anything is mentioned against Rodgers.

&gt; Everything seems to indicate he didn't get the players he wanted.

And your evidence is? There are 2 quotes where he says he has the final say. And i've posted them earlier. 

&gt; And the argument isn't that Rodgers is a great manager, 

For many here, it actually is. 

&gt;The argument is that there is reason to belive that Rodgers can get this team quite far if he has the players he wants. 

Lallana, Ashely Williams, Dejan Lovren, Ricky Lambert, Mario Ballotelli, Iago Aspas, Luis Alberto sounds like a team that would go far? 

He and the committee have had 2 clear cut successes. Sturridge and Coutinho. Beyond that, nothing to show for. Luis Suarez was not a player he bought, admittedly he got the best out of him. However, he and his pals in the committee need to buy those sort of players first. 

We may have one already this window, which seems re-assuring.

People in general *are* naive.
The vast and overwhelming majority of people in the UK have absolutely no clue about how the financial crash actually happened. They don't understand the complex financial instruments that fell apart or how and why that happened.

But they still voted on that basis for whichever party leader they thought talked the best rhetoric about it.

I work in a UK company that derives 90% of it's income from exports to the US and EU. I'm in a job that means I *do* understand a lot about currency rates and foreign markets. I wouldn't pretend to understand the financial crash, but I do get currency and the advantage/disadvantages of a strong/weak Pound.

Other people will have their own talents, but only in their specialist area. If you haven't been on benefits, it's unreasonable to expect someone to understand quite how hard it is to make ends meet (or how hard the JobCentre grind you down with their faux-cheery technicolour furniture and constant negativity).

Likewise, I know electricians and plumbers - very skilled in their own right, but not a clue on currency exchange or the impact of foreign policy, because they don't deal with it apart from converting a few Euros to go on holiday.

Moreover, they want the pound to be strong so that holidays are cheap. I want the pound to be weak most of the time so it's cheaper for European companies to buy our stuff!

Dragging a striker down with no intention of getting to the ball is a foul, it was in the box, it is a penalty. There might've been other penalties that should've been - fair enough, but it doesn't change how later penalty decisions should be called.

From what I saw of the match, the Germans only had themselves to blame. Poor defending to give away the penalty, and that chance where she had a free header and put it wide near the end. So much for #1 in the world.

Having said that I think it is becoming increasingly common, at least where I live, for the 18-25 bracket to stay at home. This is not necessarily personal choice, a lot of people want to move out. However, it is expensive to rent or buy here and living at home offers an opportunity to save. It also provides a way for families to help their child in adulthood if they cannot help out in other financial ways.

There isn't any stigma attached to this. Which is perhaps where the UK differs from the US. Having met and travelled with a few people from the US, I was left with the impression that at 18 you were very much expected to leave home and fend for yourself. Not doing so was almost seen as a failure. That is not to say that the family wouldn't support their child in non-financial ways, they could still be close, it's just a different culture and in America the ideal is that you are your own man, responsible for your own failures and successes.

you may need to Google your routers default login info to get the default username and pass.

A dual band allow you to connect to both at the same time, 2.4 typically has better range but slower speeds, 5ghz is a shorter range but the speed is much faster. To avoid interference I would use wifi analyzer  ( we use it in the field) or a similar app to find the empties channel before switching

Some routers come set up already with both, you might see something like linksys123-2.4 and linksys123-5, if not ill do my best to help you

People tend to disagree. But the people who hate Rodgers tend to sound like assholes when they try to make their point. And then act like martyrs when they're downvoted.

Well there is no evidence. Obviously Rodgers has to say that he has final say, but that's politics. Balotelli really didn't seem like a player he wanted, but a panic buy after the committee failed to land Sanchez. 

&gt;Lallana, Ashely Williams, Dejan Lovren, Ricky Lambert, Mario Ballotelli, Iago Aspas, Luis Alberto sounds like a team that would go far? 

Aspas and Alberto were gambles, like Coutinho and Sturridge were. They could've worked out, they didn't. Hindsight is 20/20. We can't compete with the big teams in spending so we'll have to make some of those gambles. Sometimes they will work out. Emre Can is another example of that. With Lallana I think the jury is still out, if he can stay fit the coming season I don't think it's impossible that he'll be a regular starter. Lambert could've done better in a better environment but was never supposed to be a starter. Could a team with Lambert on the bench do well? Yes. We had Aspas on the bench and finished second. 

But you could do the same with any team: bring up their bad signings, blame it on the manager and want to have him fired. Is Pellegrini a bad manager because Mangala and Fernandinho didn't work out and were expensive? Is Mourinho a bad manager because Felipe Luis and Cuadrado didn't work out?

Yes. Transfers have been bad. They need to be better. Hopefully this year they are - we have no idea yet.

&gt;However, he and his pals in the committee need to buy those sort of players first.

* Do you live in England/UK - If you do I probably wouldn't buy a name on the back unless you are specifically using it for going to games/pubs or playing football as it is the butt of many jokes (Full Kit W*nkers they call them) - I can imagine in other countries such as the States or Asian Countries it is more accepted.
* Is your player likely to hang around? I know alot of people got Mata and he was our best player, and the 2nd best individual performance I have seen from a Chelsea player since Drogba 2010. You could go for a safe Bet, people such as Terry, Ivanovic, Matic, Azpilicueta, Fabregas or Costa, they are Mourinho favourites. You may think why I have not included Hazard, I still feel his mind/heart is Madrid, and I think I've always been resigned to that fact so will not hold it against him, it's just after this season you may not want to be wearing it. I commend Hazard on his approach and professionalism though, many players nowadays (Mr Sterling) conduct themselves poorly and he hasn't.
* Do you have money to get either kit? If So, I would recommend getting the official Non Ali-Express kit when it is finally released as it is always nice to get the new kit. You may even want to wait until the end of the transfer window to see who we sign, we may (Not holding my breath, get a Marquee signing). In 2008 I held out and held out for a Robinho shirt and it never happened and in the end I never bothered with the shirt and havent purchased the 08/09 kit since as all it does is bring back bad memories of the worst 2 Chelsea games in recent memory (CL Final 08 and Semi v Barca 09).

This also isn't a subsidy, it's a tax, despite the dishonest use of the word subsidy. 

This money isn't moving from the rich to the poor. It's moving from people who are either poor, scraping by or just about comfortable to the rich.

If they actually wanted to tax the rich for the benefit of the majority then they would crack down on tax evasion or raise inheritance tax rather than lowering it. This is just about moving people out of council housing, depleting the affordable housing stock even further and ultimately putting more money into the hands of already rich private landlords - the real benefit scroungers of the UK.

Honestly if you apply to unskilled jobs and don't mentioned firing, most aren't going to find that out.  All you need to give them is the company name and the address it's based at, they're the ones that have to go to the effort of researching phone numbers and getting in touch with the right person/department, most can't be arsed.

Well, speculation is what we have isn't it? But reliable journalists have pointed out that it doesn't seem like Rodgers has the first and final say in transfers. James Pearce here for example (https://soundcloud.com/anfieldhq/james-pearce-corrected)

And I say this is politics because there's no way he could openly say that he didn't have anything to do with the signings as it would show that the club is as disorganised and malfunctional as it probably is. He could also have said that he thinks Borini sucks, but he hasn't. Instead he says that he shows great character. Does that mean that Rodgers thinks Borini is a great player? No. That's how football clubs are run.

Are you deliberately trying to misunderstand me? My point was *obviously* that bad signings isn't what makes a manager good or bad.

With the lawyer they give us a list of what we need and by what date, we provide it, they do all the forms, they send it off themselves and if it needs to be appealed they will let us know and deal with it (so far so good on that front).

&gt;The term ""Luddite fallacy"" is used by economists in reference to the fear that technological unemployment inevitably generates structural unemployment (and is consequently macroeconomically injurious). If a technological innovation results in a reduction of necessary labour inputs in a given sector, then the industry-wide cost of production falls, which lowers the competitive price and increases the equilibrium supply point which, theoretically, will require an increase in aggregate labour inputs


So if I understand correctly, as automation makes it cheaper to produce products, more people will be able to afford them (i.e. demand goes up). This will create more of the jobs that cannot be automated (sales, repairs, etc.) and the economy will naturally adjust to balance employment levels.

Yep. The article starts off by saying;

&gt; that anyone earning over £40,000 in London or £30,000 outside the capital will lose benefits and have to pay the full market rent.

But later on switches to;

&gt; Mr Osborne is likely to announce that from 2017/18 those on **incomes** above £40,000 in London and £30,000 in the rest of England that live in housing association and local authority properties, will be charged a market or near market rent.

Why is this distinction important?

Because while **earning** would only count money coming in from work, **income** would count all benefits as well.

This would mean that things like housing/council/child benefits would be taken into account to reach the limit. This would mean that plenty of people who claim housing benefit and live with a partner would hit this limit pretty easily.

Anyone with living with a partner and a child would hit the limit even sooner.

The government really need to clarify this. Because if this includes income from benefits, it's going to mean a reduced amount of money for a lot of working people with a partner and/or a child.",null,0,null,1436096035,null,0,false,0,cssqzfl,null,t3_3c6d10,null,t1_cssqzfl,null,t1_cssp1gv,null,null,null,1437600336,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

The issue with Adebayor is that he wants his contract to be paid and to get any loyalty benefits that accrue from that. He is currently on around £100,000 a week and is contracted until the end of the next season, and we have found it extremely difficult to find somewhere willing to pay his wages in full and pay a transfer fee to us. The result has been that if we want to actually stand a chance of selling him, we would be forced to part-fund his wages. Levy is exceptionally reluctant to do this as he would be paying for Adebayor to play for another team, which seems inately bad value for money for a player who is not proactively harming the team. This was why we didn't offload him to West Ham in January.

The best case scenario is we get around £5m for Adebayor and don't have to pay his wages, which is never going to happen. A bad scenario is that we keep him on full wages. A worse scenario is that we sell him, replace him with an inferior player for more than Adebayor costs, while at the same time paying millions of pounds in garnishing his wages.

TL;DR, if offloading our players was easy, Levy would have done it by now, and the cost of subsidising players with low wages can be worse than the alternative.",null,0,null,1436097389,null,0,false,0,cssra5s,null,t3_3c6stn,null,t1_cssra5s,null,t3_3c6stn,null,null,null,1437600631,null,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4,null

I usually Average around 400-600Gb a month, much of which is .torrent data and I've never seen throttling on any protocols.  As far as I'm concerned they're a fantastic ISP as long as you don't have to phone their customer services.  If you do, you'll be talking to someone in India who will rarely be able to help.  

I recently had a situation where a BT openreach engineer working on the cabinet down the street must have unknowingly knocked out the phone lines to the house early on a Friday evening.  It cant be a mere coincidence that our phone lines went down during the 15 minutes they were at the cabinet.  After phoning them (on mobile) they arranged for an engineer visit, but said that all their engineers had finished work for that evening and also don't work weekends.  Further to that, they couldn't get one to me until the following Thursday, *6 days from my call*.  I pretty much spent an entire shitty weekend without internet, phoning them up randomly every hour or so to have them send someone round with no luck as they wouldn't change the engineer visit date.  My persistence much have paid off however as despite not changing the engineer visit date, one turned up anyhow early on Monday morning and fixed the issue within 5 minutes.  

Other than their Indian offloaded poor customer service team, there's also the issue of site blocks.  Pretty much any and every site relating to torrenting including proxy listing sites is blocked by default with a connection refused message.

Next week is scheduled as a bye week for us, but we still have an International Champions Cup match versus Club America (11/7), and it wouldn't be all that shocking if he were to make an appearance in that one. He's made it known that he wants to get started as soon as possible, and Bruce isn't likely to hold him back.

Says the guy who just made a comparison with the Nazi's on the internet.

&gt;What you said here is that because I pay taxes to the Queen that means the Union Flag is my flag.

In response to:

&gt;Recognize its existence, but not that it's their country. They don't recognise the Union Flag as the flag of their state.

It doesn't matter what 'they' recognise, the fact is we all live in the UK and as such the state flag is the union flag. Further nationalists accept this as per GFA.

&gt;Have you been watching the story about the confederate flag in the US? How many people calling the South of the USA 'the South', because that's literally what it is? Official name, official geographical location, why is one more politically charged than another? Stop dancing around it.

That's a cultural region not a country. You can witter on about geography all you want, fact is our correct official term is Northern Ireland and calling it anything else *which you literally stated were for political reasons* is politically charged and not neutral.

&gt;I'm not offended by designated days

You on designated days compromise:

&gt;The only reason they have designated days was because it offered as a compromise to the loyalists so that they wouldn't explode at the thought of Catholics being considered.

So designated days in your opinion is a response to mindless bigotry - mob rule as you described earlier. I'm not sure how you claim that isn't being offended.

&gt;What I care about is walking through Belfast every day and having to look at a flag on my city hall that alienates me and half of the population, just because loyalists insist on it.

Even though it's already been stated by a neutral source that flying the flag 365 does not 'alienate' half the city.

&gt;The Sinn Fein motion brought down the flag entirely and Alliance agreed.

Still waiting on an explanation on this.

Definitely, can't argue with that.
I also think it would have been only fair if they won by scoring a regular goal, for our team may have had more shots on goal, but made horrible mistakes and didn't find a way to crack England's formation.
Still, to me it wasn't ""dragging a striker down"" but desperately letting oneself fall with barely being touched, all she wanted was that penalty, IMO.

Beeston- Awesome place if you're into pubs. It's got 2 big supermarkets, one of which is 24 hours, and loads of little Asian cuisine/ethnic shops along the main road. It's quiet but a little bit villagey/retirementy and between 10-20 minutes onto campus depending on your subject since campus is a big place. (Recommend a bike for Beeston) Prices are cheapest here £60-£80. Albion hall is always possible; a cheap self-catered, student accommodation. The only problem is that not many first years live here (except at Albion) and it's a long way into town (though the £1 bus sorts out that problem).

Dunkirk- Next to uni. If you want to wake up and roll into uni this is the place you want to be. There seems to be a large population of foreign students from the Malaysian/Chinese campus who live in Dunkirk; probably because it's fairly cheap £65-£85 and close to uni (5 minutes walk). You'd still be best taking a bus into town though. There are only a handful of pubs in Dunkirk, 1 cash-point/post office inside a bargain-booze/spar (small shop), so it's only real upside is the distance to uni and the price.

Lenton- Realistically you'd split Lenton into two areas: North and South. If you look on Google maps then North is anything between Ilkeston Rd and Church St (if you were to extend Church St to the East until The Park), South is anything between the extended Church St and Castle Boulivard (A6005/ the canal). The house prices are similar between North and South Lenton, £70-£95. It's a very studenty location and so the landlords can charge a bit more. The only real difference between North and South Lenton is the amenities. There is 1 medium sized Sainsburys in North Lenton, and that's basically it. It's on the bus route so travel will be no problem (you'll probably be getting the bus into town). However, it's also on a hill so cycling back from uni will be a ball ache. South Lenton is much better for amenities, it's got a few small shops, hairdressers, 1 large Sainsburys (castle marina area- 5 minute walk), 24 hour mcdonalds, petrol station, cash points etc. The bus into town is faster (route is on the A6005/castle boulivard), though you'll most likely walk into town from South Lenton (20 minutes). The road is flatter so you can cycle into uni easily. Basically, South Lenton has the student population of North Lenton plus is more convenient for travel and amenities.

Canning Circus- At the top of Derby Rd hill so it could be a pain cycling back from uni. It's on a bus route so you could just get a bus to and from uni. Walking distance to town and the area has some of the nicest pubs in Nottingham. I don't know the house prices that well, anything from £70 I'd imagine. The area is more suited to young professionals than students but plenty of students still live there. There are a few amenities such as a small Tesco, a couple of off licenses, hairdresser etc. though you are close to town so anything you will need will just be a short walk away.

That's nice. For *you*, anyway.

&gt;see no reason to brandish it as some kind of weapon in your divisive war with religion.

Do explain how ""I don't like people mutilating children"" becomes a war on religion generally from my comments. Expanding the scope to a degree I didn't express in order to defend such a daft practice gives away more than you realise.

&gt;Dovyou hold such bile for 90% of America men for example

When they do it for no reason? Certainly - but you're out of date; It's far less than that these days. You'll need to brush up more though, because 'everyone does it' isn't really an excuse anyway. And do explain why not wanting to pointlessly cut bits off of babies *isn't* worthy of 'bile'.

&gt;they have the same operation, or is that less of an issue due to religion... or should I say ""not being Jewish?""

Wow, ignorance or because someone's god says so...yes, let's concentrate on that instead of the actual act being barbaric and indefensible (which you really could have figured out from my previous comments, but hey-ho, you've obviously given this *so much* consideration...)

null,false,ginningmosquitoes,null,null,null,"One of the things I like to do is read books on logical fallacies and cognitive biases, so I'll add my two pence to this.

I don't think anyone really likes to admit that they're wrong. I think [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) plays a part in this. If someone starts a debate over why Kingsman is a bad film, they can ignore the 77% fresh rating it has on rottentomatoes - there are 49 negative reviews from critics (compared to 140 positive ones). 49 reviews could mean anywhere from 49 - 150+ pages of essay about why this movie is bad. If only 25% of them came up with their own solid, unique reasons to dislike it, that's a solid 12 reasons to fully detail what's  wrong with what is generally regarded as a good movie (albeit calling it ""good"" because a lot of critics liked it could easily be seen as an appeal to authority or an appeal to popularity - The Oscars is essentially the [epitome](http://www.vulture.com/2012/02/oscar-voters-are-almost-exclusively-old-white-men.html) of that combination. If you're pooling 6000 people to find out what the best films of the year are, why are they 94% white, 74% male, and at a median age of 62?). 

And Kingsman is just *one movie* - compare that to an entire career (e.g. I quite like Miley Cyrus now and Kanye West), or a heavily nuanced argument (e.g. MRAs v Feminists) and the entire issue becomes a lot more complex, especially on Reddit. For example, Miley has a career of supporting numerous charities, she's openly bisexual, progressive on gender (regardless of one's stance on gender, people who don't align themselves with either do exist, and there's only a handful of celebrities who have been as openly helpful), she stood by her stance on animal welfare enough to go vegan, and so forth - but her attempt to rid her Hannah Montanna imagine (added with the fact that the userbase of Reddit were all a little too old to watch her shows, meaning we all only ever saw her progression from annoying kid person to annoying adult) may have been seen as overly sexualised (and that is putting it extremely lightly). Supporting charity v being overly sexualised v ""publicity stunts"" and so forth are all heavy handed arguments, and to fully discuss a decade of her life is never going to happen on Reddit, so branding her as bad (or good) turns into a reduction of the most well known activities (e.g. fatpeoplehate used to be a massive echo chamber for hating fat people, and they only allowed fat people there if they were ""self hating fatties"". The only issue is that [fat shaming doesn't work](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/11/fat-shaming-lose-weight-study) - regardless of whether or not they thought they were helping [and it's clearly quite apparent that they were there purely for the vitriol to me], that study shows that they weren't. Only being exposed to ""I was fat but you guys made me feel shit so I lost weight"", ""I used to be fat, but I lost weight and hate fat people"", and ""I just hate fat people"" is never going to lead to a developed discussion).

If you add to this that people argue to [win arguments](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/arts/people-argue-just-to-win-scholars-assert.html?_r=4) as opposed to come to the right answer (if you want a more comical take on that, it's also enter number 5 on this [Cracked article](http://www.cracked.com/article_19468_5-logical-fallacies-that-make-you-wrong-more-than-you-think.html )), then it becomes apparent that Reddit, and The World really isn't equipped for anyone totally changing their mind.

There are certain fights against this - /r/changemyview has that submitters must ""personally hold the view and **be open to changing**"", and threads where the OP doesn't respond after 3 hours are deleted.

And I do think that it's possible for people to slowly become exposed to more arguments. A room with one lit candle in it produces a little light; a room with 100 lit candles can produce a lot more - if that makes sense? 

I think [hindsight bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias) plays an important role in it - if you're exposed to one reason why item X is *just as bad* as item Y, then another reason why, and then exposed to a reason why certain motives make things worse, and then a reason expounding in detail details on item Y, eventually a person might come to believe that item Y is worse than X. After a long enough time they'd come to believe that they *always had* believed this, despite believing otherwise.

I think that's why the ultimate act of developing as a person in this area is to discuss over argue. Once it's set in stone on the internet that you've said and held position X, you're going to end up defending it to the bone. What makes more sense is to have the humility to say (literally every time, in ones head if not in writing) ""I may be wrong in this..."", and to be able to express that you're by no means an expert in the area. That way you'll look less of a dick if you change your mind. Although I think the best way for people to be do this (which, in my opinion, leads to to people actually developing their opinions. Only hanging around with people who hold even moderate views that you share [can lead to extremism](http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/3731248/to-become-an-extremist-hang-around-with-people-you-agree-with/).) is to be aware of as many different biases as they can, and be able to face uncomfortable truths and all that other drivel. 

But asking for humility on Reddit? It happens -  I've seen people individually visit /r/asktransgender and other boards to help them learn, but it's very few and far between.

Anyway, as I stated like 200 times more than necessary, those are just my thoughts (and I didn't even mention a discussion where I had/ had not changed my mind.), but I hope you get something out of it regardless. I'm not exactly an expert in the area, and my perception of Reddit would fall under ""anecdotal"" as opposed to empirical - i.e. the same cognitive biases I've complained about everyone on Reddit having are the same biases that you and I, by default have.

null,false,jonnydark,null,null,null,"The term ""mansplaining"" refers to when men condescendingly explain something in a particular field, to a woman under the unconscious assumption that because she is a woman she doesn't understand it, despite her being an expert in that field. I've seen this happen most often in tech and science circles where, say, if there's a group conversation and a niche term comes up, a man in the group will without warrant turn to the woman in the group and explain it to her, despite that woman being an expert. You also hear stories about things such as men explaining to women what periods feel like, but ~~I'm sure~~ I fucking hope they're rare occurrences.

As such having a ""no mansplaining zone"" is pretty uncontroversial. Functionally it's just a ""a no condescending-dickhead zone"" with a language signifier to point out that the area is feminist friendly.

However the term ""mansplaining"" has some issues because people who don't know what it means then make an incorrect assumption about it. Mansplain is a portmanteau of man and explain and so it seems reasonable to assume that the term refers to any instance when a man explains something (like I am doing right now). As such they look at this picture and think it's Natalie Bennett standing next to a sign smiling saying ""No men are allowed to speak here!"" which looks pretty fucking sexist when the irony is - it's the opposite. However instead of thinking ""That's ridiculous, surely she can't mean that!"" and looking in to it further, they stop at the moral outrage.

There is also the problem that thanks to the Social Justice zealousness of tumblr users and other teenagers, the term does get abused and it gets thrown around when it's not appropriate. As such some people regard the term as ""playing the female card"" in order to shut someone down who has a valid point.

There are also the type who don't like the fact that it has the word ""man"" in it because ""gendered terms are sexist"" or something - but these are the sorts of people who say that Feminism is a sexist enterprise and that logic I just can't even.

There's a discussion of this over on /r/ukpolitics where you can see the outrage for yourself. I tried explaining it all to set the record straight and I got downvoted to oblivion.

What the heck does that mean? Are you talking about computers making procedurally generated films or something? Because we are *nowhere near* that right now. It would take centuries, perhaps never, for an AI to come up with something that could pump out scripts, poems, songs at even a fraction of the quality that humans could come up with.

People really overestimate how far we are with AI at the moment, even technology as a whole. I've seen people talking about self-driving cars as something that will become commonplace in 30 years. It's simply not going to happen - cost is a major, major issue for example, as well as the length of time it would take to prepare the roads, as well as convincing people to abandon driving in certain areas.

Personally I think spare bulbs are pretty sensible, and for the fiver it costs to have the vest and breathylyser and the tiny space they take up I always carry them just in case. Similarly, there's been stories of people being accused of forgery trying to give a photocopy of their V5 to the police, I don't see any great gain in not having the original so I carry that. 

The AA have some info on what is and isn't allowed; its been updated since things tarted changing in 2012:

http://www.theaa.com/motoring_advice/overseas/driving-abroad-whats-new-2012.html

Not unlike British police, if you get pulled over for something then the French police are likely to see what else they can get you for. I don't know enough French to have a discussion with a French policeman about the minutae of his laws.

Generally, though, it's just like driving in Britain, but on the wrong side of the road. I tend to get the hang of riding on the right within a couple of miles of the ferry, but I *never* get the hang of roundabouts, and keep looking the wrong way, so I'd advise keeping an eye out for that. 

French motorways are thoroughly dull and have tolls, you can use http://autoroutes.fr to plan a route and figure out the toll cost. Also, they have two sorts of service station, one's simply a rest area with benches and sometimes a toilet, the others are like normal British service stations - the signposts introducing them have pictograms for what's on offer, and a service station with a picture of a bench and of a toilet is genuinely just that - benches and a toilet block.

Lots of places close on Sundays, including (rural) petrol stations, though the prepay-at-pump ones often stay open. These often have a single payment point where you say which pump you want and which fuel and then put your card in, from there on it's like a pay at pump here.

Keep an eye out for 'priorité au droit' - it's signified by a yellow diamond sign.  In essence, you need to give way to vehicles pulling out from turnings despite your being on the nominally major road.

FTFY. 

The problem was that nothing was done to replace the reliance on those communities on the pits and factories. You have generations of miners and steelworkers, and all of the vast network of supporting businesses that rely on the steady income of those miners and factory workers, and the rug was pulled out from under them with little warning and no attempt to replace the decades of steady industry with new investment, retraining or anything else.

And 30, 40 years later, there still hasn't been any investment in the areas.

Certainly, the communities became established because that's where the work was, but given that that was 100, 120 years ago or more, is it reasonable to expect the third, fourth, fifth generation of residents to just up sticks and move to where the work is now, rather than expect that the people who closed the businesses on which their community relied for a century might make some effort to offset the devastating effect it had?

A quick look at the map doesn't show many around Bradford - not sure about the rest of the county. That might mean that the DR650 will be useful to get to them, even if it's a bit clumsy off road. It will certainly be much lighter than my Explorer 1200, which I take down the easier routes. A 250 is better once you are on the trail (I have a TT250R), but not great for getting there. I'm fortunately to live in Berkshire, which is riddled with green roads).

Green roads (the TRF's officially preferred term, to stress that we have legal access) can vary from dead straight farm tracks that used to be Roman roads, to tricky little paths through dense wood. Some of them are ancient - up to 5000 years old. While they are legally roads, many of them are completely impassable to 4wd vehicles and even navigation can be a challenge. If you are intending to ride two-up, very few of them will be practical.

Do be careful with the people that you meet. Stop your engine if you see a horse. Horse riders are generally friendly (the managing director of the TRF is also senior in the British Horse Society, and we have a history of cooperating in running communications for horsey events).  Walkers may be hostile. I'm a walker myself, and have never been disturbed by bikes, but some walkers in the Ramblers Association have an ideological objection to motor vehicles in the countryside. One 80-year old member of our club was attacked with a walking-pole while riding legally on the Ridgeway. This is exceptional, but do be careful of extremists - it's unlikely that they can do you any real damage if you are wearing riding gear, but they can be unpleasant. Make sure you know your legal rights and are prepared to explain them politely.

For navigation, I recommend [Viewranger](http://www.viewranger.com) on your phone.  You can buy 1:50000 or 1:25000 maps for it (about £90 for the UK at 1:50000).

Jack Kilby was the first to make it a practical reality by constructing the first working integrated circuit, and Robert Noyce made some major improvements to the design a little while later. Konrad Zuse did build the first working digital computer, but it was electromechanical relying on moving parts to work. John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry constructed the first working all electronic digital computer at Iowa State University in 1942. 

The Colossus was another milestone in that it was all electronic like the Atanasoff-Berry computer, but also partially programmable. The ENIAC was the first fully programmable electronic computer, and therefore generally considered the first general purpose computer. Still, Berry and Atanasoff made the first full electronic computer.

Apart from reducing sensitivity and introducing a surgical risk for no reason. Like I said, you've obviously, er, given this lots of consideration.

In other words, 'everyone does it'. Not good enough.

Not sure where you got that from - and in any case, that child will spend the rest of their life missing part of their body because their parents sided with a religious demand over their offsprings' well-being. Yeah, no issues there at all.

First of we in no way reject our chilren once they leave home. We are still there for help and support. Im 45 and still call my dad for help around the house. 

But we do make an effort to raise our children to be independent. If a parent has done their job well. Once a child is an adult they will be ready to go out on there own and make there own mistakes and learn from them. But we will be there to help when we are needed.

Because of this our society tends to change more drematically from one generation to the next. As our adults more often then not have to make there own mind up what they think about things like same sex and interracial relationships etc. I do not think the general acceptance of these things would be as high in the west. If most younger adults had to worry about the opinions of their mum dad gran and grandad every day when they came home. 

It is also a ralativly new thing in the west. Before WW2 it would be common for 3 generations to share a house. As work paid better and the cost of living came down we started to see this. But mostly it came because of draft. Young men went to war as soon as they turned 18. They grew up as a generation having left home and survived in the army.

Given the trends in the asking price for live rights, (Which are now in the only viable television commodity as more people cut the cord advertisers want something people will watch live; and sport is basically it.) we could see a 2-3 times raise in revenue for the teams. Basically relegation this year is a massive loss to any team and the bottom of the table should be very interesting though I doubt we'll be there.

All that said, we've spent very wisely, run almost no debt, are in negotiations to buy the Liberty form the Council, (I hope it stays the Liberty, that is a solid name, and is a local company) and now have a Category One Youth Setup. We will be fine in the long run and it seems like we are in at least the top two divisions for the foreseeable future, far better than our history where I believe average league position for the nearly 100 years of active seasons is still in the third tier.

null,false,AnalyticContinuation,null,null,null,"Money and the economy in general is just society's way of keeping track of the contribution that humans make to the general well-being. We don't pay robots or machines a salary. If a machine performs a role that used to be done by a human then the value of that role in society changes. We all need to contribute. How we contribute changes and which skills are valued changes.

But fundamentally it is always necessary for humans to contribute (i.e. have a 'job' or earn money somehow) to society. There would be no benefit to a world in which everyone is destitute but surrounded by machines creating huge amounts of food and desirable products.

10,000 years ago most people would have been working hard each day just catching or preparing food and maybe maintaining their dwellings - patching leaks etc. Now, very few people are directly involved in food production but that shift did not mean that people sat around waiting to be fed by the few that did continue producing food. During the industrial revolution most people worked in factories. Now that is changing. Once it took huge numbers of clerks sitting at desks just to maintain the accounts of companies. Now that job has completely disappeared (at least in that form.)

The important point about jobs/money is that it is a human construct. Tasks which humans do not need to do any more can't have value unless there is a human involved at both ends. It is impossible to guess what roles humans will find to fill the gaps. Who would have guessed 10,000 years ago that some people would be paid just to hit a ball back and forth over a net with no other commitments at all?

null,false,burgleurgle,null,null,null,"I'm a pretty big admirer of the BBC and I lean leftwards, so when I read the article I initially thought ""ugh, typical Tories, trying to destroy a great public service"", then I realised that what Osborne is saying kinda fits in with how the BBC has always worked.

Examples:

* The BBC World Service used to broadcast all over eastern Europe due to lack of a free press there. Now that most countries in that region have a free-enough press of their own the BBC doesn't broadcast to most of them anymore.

* The BBC played a huge role in popularising personal computing (anybody remember the BBC Micro and BBC BASIC?). Now that there's more than enough private and independent organisations working in this area the BBC no longer do this kind of work.

* Until only a few years ago the BBC website used to carry video games reviews. They stopped after deciding that private and independent sites were doing a much better and more comprehensive job at it than them.

Similarly, the BBC led the way in internet publishing in the UK. Osborne is saying that once newspapers become online-only the BBC website will be doing a lot of **non-news** stuff that the private sector is doing too. If you read the article (as opposed to just the headline) Osborne's basically saying that for **non-news** stuff (he specifically mentions ""features and cooking recipes"") newspaper websites now do a good-enough job that maybe the BBC should pull back from some of these activities.

As I've shown above, pulling back from areas where the private sector is doing a good job is something that the BBC has done many times in its past. I think it's important that we have a politically-neutral news provider, but it sounds like Osborne is criticising the breadth of the BBC's online **non-news** output, which doesn't seem like an unreasonable criticism to make.

She lived with me on and off for over 2 years in the UK and abroad under various visa; But she had to apply from outside the UK for the spouse visa. If you already have some types of UK visa i think you can apply in the UK check with a lawyer/visa specialist. (some charge not a lot to answer X questions).

The easiest visa you are going to get is the Spouse Visa

1. UK Partner needs to earn £18,600; with pay history 3-6 months and things like a contract of employment.
2. You`ll need proof where you can live.
3. You`ll need a TB Cert (if from some countries, insane PC policy as they have several first world countries on the list).
5. You can fast track your Visa processes into weeks if you pay another £200 odd pounds (varies) on top of the standard £800. Otherwise you`ll wait at least 1-2 months for result.

If you go down your own work Visa; in 5 years time you`ll need to be earning £35k a year (and it will go up between now and then); you`ll know if that is realistic.

Also remember you can always apply from an other EU country; so if you have to leave the country you could always get a job in Ireland or another country as a stop gap while you wait.

The government actually lost a court case that said £18k was unfair and to much (we do not all live in London); but I do not think that has resulted in a policy change, if it will result a change in a few years, we have to wait and see.

[Aviva](http://www.aviva.co.uk/stakeholder-pension/)

Some of these providers will offer other more advanced products that give more fund availability and such but genereally speaking stakeholders are a very good starting place. Keep in mind that by no means are you tied to the provider you choose for life, as transferring pensions has become very simple and (depending on the company) reasonably swift. Once you've built up a good amount you can always consider switching into more advanced products like SIPPS and such if you one day decide you want to take more control over your money and manage your investments more.  

One thing I would recommend if you aren't too familiar with the concept of funds and what is the best to invest in for you, is to invest into any of these providers lifestyling programmes, which are basically strategies that have been set up by the provider to dictate what you invest in and when to move your investments elsewhere. For example, one such lifestyling strategy may be to invest your money in realatively risky and adventurous funds when you're first starting out to give you maximum growth potential, and then your money may gradually be put into lower risk funds the closer you are to retirement to protect your money.

Not sure if he had his best season this season but I thought he was quite good this season I have to say.

* Did he meet expectations? For me I think he did. He seems to have his game of the season against City at home once again. He met my expectations, Good solid season for me.

* Where do you see him in the squad next season? I think his game time will be limited. I'm not sure how I feel about it. I know what he brings to the team and sometimes it's what you need other times you need a bit more flair and quality so I understand.


* Where do you see him in the squad in 3 years? I could genuinely see him leaving and if he finds a lack of game time here and wants more I'd be happy to let him leave.
