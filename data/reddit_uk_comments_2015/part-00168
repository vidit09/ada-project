If for example you were seen as a good risk (everything is all about risk) then they may not look at the data. Ie 45yr old woman, no accidents or driving offenses, combined with the right car (think boring more than power) and most importantly location then they just accept the risk and proceed. Now if you had a higher risk person then you might use that data to try and help lower the quote and be more competitive, or help to increase the premium if that person is more of a risk. 

Most modern insurance companies are brokers or intermediaries so are quoting for another principle  insurer. The principle insurers are the ones who underwrite (create the terms and pay any claims). Think like a reseller. Those terms are where this additional data comes in to play. Some may want it, others may not. It's all about what sort of 'risk' they are looking for. This targeted risk seeking for insurers is pretty obvious when you look at insurers like saga or the ladies only insurers. 

What really will blow your mind is that they won't be looking necessarily at you buying booze it could be a mix of things such as if you bought a value pot noodle etc. I don't know how or why they come to their reasoning behind it. However I know that they have to be completely transparent to the FOB in justifying their risk analysis. 

I haven't worked in insurance in 5 years so things might of changed but back then we had data that was no less than 2 weeks old in the system at anyone time.

're the manpower required, not really. At the end of the day the underwriters are building a maths problem. A computer does the donkey work.

null,false,Magneto88,null,null,null,"Take your pick from the following:

* An unwillingness to adapt ideas from abroad. For a long time England has basked in it's status as creator of the game and refused to adapt to new trends. This was first evident in the 1950s when Hungary and the 'Magical Magyars' become the first non UK team to win at Wembley and then smashed us in Hungary and it's continued to the present day. We've seen how Spain and Germany have both built successful teams based upon an ethos of one style of play through all age groups and working closely with the major teams in the country. Our FA continues to ignore the idea of sending teams coaches to study other nations, has a horrible relationship with the major club teams and in it's most recent plan for the future, put forward the ideas for a 'national style of play' which said absolutely nothing other than incredibly generic suggestions. Every time they say they're going to revamp youth coaching and take ideas from abroad, they come up with incredibly conservative plans. Hell it took for a decade for our version of Clairefontaine (St George's Park in Burton) to finally be built.
* The corrosive nature of the EPL. A certain % of young players are prevented from ever gaining any experience in English football, in 2009 the England U-21s were beaten by the German U-21s in the European U-21 Championship final. Of those players that played that day, 6 Germans are part of the national team now. Of the English, only Theo Walcott and James Milner are and Walcott had already been playing for the national team. Some of these players are prevented from breaking into the EPL by fairly average foreign players imported into the league. While the very best are not (as those who argue against foreign quotas state), those of a middling talent who may flourish given first team experience definitely are. It's self evident in the fact that England has for a good while now, done consistently well in European youth tournaments but never translated this into senior football. Furthermore because of the huge amount of cash in the English game, many English youngsters (18-21) show one flash of ability, get signed up to a £40-60k a week deal immediately and then piss their life and ability away due to this. A lot are from rough and sometimes ill educated backgrounds and are especially susceptible to this, look at Ravel Morrison, for someone who was at times considered as good as Pogba in the Man United youth team and who has since pissed his career away and will probably never play for the England senior team.
* The sheer pressure of playing for England. Nearly fifty years of failure (Italia '90 and England '96 aside) have created a massive burden on the shoulders of England players. The fact that football is so popular in England furthers this and many players buckle under the pressure. There's also a sub-set of players who blatantly don't give a crap about playing for their nation and see it as more of a chore at times. Look at the amount of prima-donnas who pull out of U-21 matches. This wouldn't happen in Germany or Spain.
* Bad management. Since Glenn Hoddle we've arguably had managers that haven't understood the England team well and/or persisted in picking players for their name instead of for the benefit of the team. Look at the decade long debate over playing Gerrard/Lampard together. In a nation like Germany, the national coach would have sacrificed one player for the good of the nation, however in England the media tends to subscribe to the cult of the individual and thus we have issues like that. We also have a lot of managers who aren't exactly tactical geniuses, even Capello didn't show much as England manager. Had Mourinho taken over in 2008 when we wanted him, this might have changed.
* Bad FA. While the above all kind of cover this, the FA is consistently backwards, run by old white men who are members of the old boys club, resistant to change and hardly trend setting in anything non commercial that it does. It's usually ten years behind the times in it's actions and is trampled all over by the Premier League. Contrast this to the control that the DFB has over the Bundesliga and it's forthright decisive actions that it took after the German failure in EURO 2000, ultimately coming to fruition in the 2008-14 period.",null,0,null,1430780309,null,0,1430824433,0,cqyhask,null,t3_34vbxe,null,t1_cqyhask,null,t3_34vbxe,null,null,null,1432773043,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

null,false,christopherw,null,null,null,"I took advantage of a discounted balance transfer offer from Barclaycard recently - 32 months 0% on the balance (after a 2% fee), plus about 15 months 0% on new purchases.

It's great if you have a chunk of cash in your account which you wish to pay down in neat monthly chunks against a quantifiable annual / periodic outgoing - e.g., car insurance policy - and they're useful for purchases over £50 for the aforementioned consumer protections. Things like car insurance are cheaper if you buy in one go (why pay the high APR for their own finance deals?) and even if you don't have 0% on purchases, the credit card is invariably lower.

Using a credit card to get around the problem of an instant debit of money from your account is very useful for preserving an instantaneous balance for things like rent, council tax (which will add a surcharge for credit cards) and food shops. If you're disciplined, and get the right selection of cards, you can use one just for petrol and earn some reward or points on that, do monthly shopping on another and set up a direct debit to pay it off in full on an agreed date, then use another for spontaneous purchases.

My rule of thumb for credit limits is 3x your monthly net income. If you're scared, ask for a lower limit (e.g. 500, 850 is really the low end of practical limits) and avoid spending on it until you feel comfortable getting into the routine of regularly checking balance and paying off.

Barclaycard and NatWest are good for sending text alerts on balances, Barclaycard send me payment reminder texts and their online portal is pretty good. Way better than NatWest's. HSBC's mediocre, but at least it's more integrated with their main account system now if you have a current account.

----
Having a debit card in good standing will positively affect your credit score, but not as much as you think. Once you're out of the 'bad score' zone, there's far more factors at play than simply paying off your credit card every month (living circumstances, marital status, job, length lived in property, even how many debt obligations you have to different companies!).

It's more black magick than a science. The main credit agencies will evaluate differently based on what they're asked, when and how often. (Experian, Equifax, Callcredit - of which Noddle is a brand, and who offer a fairly decent free credit check service which I use).

If you can always pay off the amount you spend, or set aside money to do so over a longer period during a card's interest-free period, you're golden. It's a completely free overdraft.

However, once that 0% period ends... compound interest awaits, which is bad times! So don't rack up thousands on a credit card with the ""manyana, manyana"" ideology towards paying that debt down, and you should be alright.

I'd only ever use a credit card for a significant high street purchase like electrical goods, car insurance - even things like festival tickets (which are usually non-refundable).

Another advantage is that you can use your debit card for smaller purchases like food and independent retailers where the credit card fees imposed on *them* by their payment processors can often sap their razor thin profit margins (whereas debit cards are a flat pence amount for them to process due to the far lower risk level, as the customer will either have funds available or not).

If a party wins the majority of seats in the House of Commons (326), the leader of that party is invited to form a government. However, all the pollsters and the experts think that one party winning a majority outright is highly unlikely (&gt;1%) since Labour and the Tories are currently tied in the polls, and have been for weeks. In the case of a hung parliament, where one party does not win an overall majority, the PM is the person who can command the support of the majority of MPs in the House of Commons, so they need to rely on support from other parties. This support can be a coalition, like we've had for the past five years, a supply and confidence deal, where the smaller party/parties agree to back the government on votes of confidence, and finally a more informal agreement where smaller parties would vote to keep a larger party in government. Since either Labour or the Tories will need to rely on the support of these smaller parties, they'll be expected to make concessions and compromise, giving parties like UKIP or the Lib Dems promises that they will have a say on certain areas of policy, in return for their support (either formal or informal). For instance, the Lib Dems managed to keep 75% of their manifesto promises from 2010 by bartering with the Conservatives in exchange for helping them form a government. The Lib Dems have already set out several 'red lines' which they will insist are met by Labour or the Tories before agreeing to support them. UKIP AFAIK have only one demand - a 'full, free and fair' EU referendum - If the Tories want their backing, they'll need to meet this demand. Alternatively, in the case of Labour and the SNP, Ed Miliband has refused to give concessions to the SNP or form a government with them - he's hoping that the SNP's bark is worse than their bite and that they would support Labour in  vote of confidence regardless, since the alternative is the Tories, who are toxic in large parts of Scotland. So I definitely wouldn't say a vote for a smaller party like UKIP is a wasted vote - the more MPs they have, the more leverage they will have over the two large parties to try and deliver on their promises and affect policy.

[This is the correct pronunciation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PSotifsGKA).

That said, you're not going to get very far without learning some basics first. 

You may have noticed that double Ls in Welsh don't sound a thing like an English L. Ll is actually a separate letter in the Welsh alphabet - and there are five of them in Llanfair PG. 

To say ""Ll"", start with an ""S"", and, while exhaling, move your tongue upward so that it comes into contact with the roof of your mouth. Air will now escape around the sides of your tongue, producing a hissing sound not all that dissimilar from an English ""Sh"". That's a Welsh ""Ll"".

[Here's what it should sound like](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Voiceless_alveolar_lateral_fricative.ogg).

Another key sound is ""Ch"". Again, it sounds nothing like the English ""Ch"", and there are two of them in Llanfair PG. If you know how to pronounce Ch in German or a J in (European) Spanish, then you know the Welsh Ch. Otherwise, start with an English C. A Welsh Ch is articulated slightly further back in the throat than an English C, and involves constricting the airway, rather than closing it completely.

[Here's what it should sound like](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Voiceless_uvular_fricative.ogg).

All the other sounds should be familiar enough to an English speaker, though they might not appear when you expect given the differences in orthography. Here's how I'd break it down phonetically:

* **Llan** - as in ""pan"", but with an Ll.
* **vyre** - as in ""pyre"", but with a V.
* **pooll** - short ""oo"", an in ""good"". Remember, that's an Ll, not an L.
* **guin** - all Welsh Gs are hard, as in ""gun"", not ""gin"".
* **gill**
* **gog** - fairly long O here, as in ""r**oa**r""
* **er** - E as in ""pen"", not ""perm""
* **ich** - Ch as above, not as in ""church""
* **uirn** - both vowel sounds should be audible; don't revert to something like ""b**urn**"".
*  **drob** - short O, as in ""orange"".
* **ooll** - short ""oo"" again - as in ""good"".
* **llan** - don't bother pronouncing the two separate ""Ll""s.
* **tuss** - as in ""Gus"".
* **il**
* **io** - short ""o"" again.
* **go** - and again.
* **go** - and again.
* **goch** - and again.

Technically your Rs should be tapped / rolled as well - as in Spanish.

Oscar has been our starter all season and benched when he was badly out of form, or simply needed a rest. While I do think part of it is just due to the fatigue of playing without a break for a few years now, there's no doubt he's been inconsistent and when he doesn't play well, the team does suffer. Willian offers a more consistent option in the middle, he's been good when he plays there, he tracks back, and at the end of the day when you have so many things to worry about as a manager, then Oscar may be the one that is sold just for the sake of practicality. Do I want it to happen? Absolutely not, I love Oscar. Hypothetically, let's say we sign Bale. I think that as it stands, with Oscar desperately needing a rest, and his inconsistency, Willian would be the starter in the middle in order to give Bale the position on the right. Then it clicks, and we see that the best midfield trio would be Hazard, Willian, and Bale, then what happens to Oscar? He's okay with being on the bench a few times because he's a professional and he understands being given a rest. Will he be as okay with it when he's not starting a majority of the games? Will he be as okay with it when a team like PSG (just an example) comes in and offers a lot of money? It puts the club in a situation where if they receive an offer, they need to see if Oscar is key to the longterm project (which I think is becoming a European superclub) and if he will be successful. If it's another David Luiz scenario, what would stop us from signing? Especially if we have Willian playing well, and then it opens up a spot for a world class winger? I love Oscar, but you gotta look at the situation as it happens. We won't sell him right off the bat, I wouldn't think. We have plenty of funds as it is to make a big money signing. TV Money, new shirt sponsor, maybe a sale or two in the summer, Hazards contract opened up money, we have no need to sell (yet).

null,false,joepo32,null,null,null,"&gt;I think Willian could fit Mou's preferred style when played through the middle. Cuadrado just came in, and Oscar would give us a lot of cash. Oscar has been our starter all season and benched when he was badly out of form, or simply needed a rest.

That's simply not true. A lot of the times he was benched was because of the setup Jose wanted. And who gives a shit Cuadrado just came in if you find a player like Bale who plays his position better then he gets replaced.

&gt;Willian offers a more consistent option in the middle

I don't think that's true at all. Oscars offers more than he can in the middle. I think however he would make a great player to be pressing Oscar to improve. He would make a great back up option for the center and the right.

&gt;I think that as it stands, with Oscar desperately needing a rest, and his inconsistency,

Could him needing a rest be a sign of why he has been inconsistent? We need another option up the middle. Dumping all that load on Willian isn't going to help. The best option would be to have Oscar, Willian, Bale(if bought). You get a true proven central player, a player would can play centrally out wide, and a player who can play out wide.

 Willian would be the starter in the middle in order to give Bale the position on the right. Then it clicks, and we see that the best midfield trio would be Hazard, Willian, and Bale, then what happens to Oscar? 

I don't see William beating out Oscar. I also don't think you sell Oscar assuming that's how it would go down. If anything you loan Caudrado and see how it plays out. Oscar isn't going to lose value.

&gt;Will he be as okay with it when a team like PSG (just an example) comes in and offers a lot of money? It puts the club in a situation where if they receive an offer, they need to see if Oscar is key to the longterm project (which I think is becoming a European superclub) and if he will be successful. If it's another David Luiz scenario, what would stop us from signing? Especially if we have Willian playing well, and then it opens up a spot for a world class winger? I love Oscar, but you gotta look at the situation as it happens. We won't sell him right off the bat, I wouldn't think. We have plenty of funds as it is to make a big money signing. TV Money, new shirt sponsor, maybe a sale or two in the summer, Hazards contract opened up money, we have no need to sell (yet). I personally will leave it to the board and even though I'd be gutted to see Oscar go, I trust the club to be making the proper decision. 

PSG would have to offer 80 mil for him for us to sell. Maybe more. They do see him has a part of the future. Jose has said it many times.

null,false,ggow,null,null,null,"&gt;I am Scottish but i have been living in England for the last 20 years. I think SNP are dreadful and the majority of supporters are just seeing it as England vs Scotland.

Your long absence might explain your wholly inaccurate perception of SNP supporters, as well as your wholly inaccurate portrayal of the SNP's record in government. If you really think it's only about 'The English and Trident', then you really haven't being paying attention. 

&gt;Fired 4000 NHS Staff

No, they didn't fire them. Staff numbers were reduced by around 3800 by not refilling positions as they were vacated, either by people leaving or by people retiring. 

&gt;Lost 1000 beds

This is a pretty meaningless statistic when it's not placed in the context of a major drive to move to care in the community and stopping people from occupying hospital beds unnecessarily. It also compares well with the 23,000 beds lost in England over the four years to mid 2014. 

&gt;NHS Funding Differences

Firstly, is it not the the point of devolution that a devolved administration might take a different view on where it was appropriate to direct resources? In the Scottish context, where spending on healthcare is already way higher than in England, might it not be wise to spare other departments higher than necessary cuts if the NHS is in a better position to bear it than in, for example, England? Secondly, it's my understanding that the IFS report your link is based on was flawed, in that it didn't take in to account the different mechanisms by which healthcare was provided in Scotland vis-a-vis in England, something to do with the aforementioned care in the community and the involvement of Local Authorities. 

&gt;Midwives and Nursing

On the face of it, relatively damning. What are the actual consequences? IS there any evidence that the Government's claim, that they're regulating the stream of students to meet future demand, is incorrect? 

&gt;College places cut

Full-time equivalent positions have remained mostly the same. The cut has came at the cost of older learners and for the most part not directly at the expense of young people leaving school (as is often claimed when free tuition is being painted as an unprogressive policy). 

&gt;cut student bursaries

True, but it enabled them to increase the net amount going in to the poorest students pockets. Personally, though I need to pay back more when I graduate, I've been in a better financial position in my studies as a result. 

&gt;Allowed police to regularly carry guns

Misleading. An operational decisions was taken whereby armed policy officers were allowed to respond to normal incidents if they were in the vicinity. This was only a very small fraction of the police but was intended as a way to better utilise the resources available. In any case, the decision was reversed. 

&gt;GARL cancellation

Probably for the best, especially in the context of it having a poor BCR and the Holyrood budget being cut. Elements of the scheme were still delivered as the Pasiley Corridor Improvement project, with train paths and the new platforms being used to increase commuter services into Glasgow Central. 

&gt;Sturgeon's pay

Laughably misleading headline. Firstly, she didn't take the pay rise and it's still substantially below the PMs. Secondly, it only happened because MSPs voted to increase there salary in advance of MPs. Thirdly, the pay rise was smaller than what MPs got shortly after, returning the situation to what it was before. Fourthly, the vote was carried out to de-link the pay scheme from MPs, a decision that meant the pay rise was inline with inflation, rather than 10% coming up after the election. Previous to the vote, the pay was set at 87.5% of an MPs salary. With the huge increase lined up for MPs, they effectively were voting to reject a huge pay rise. 

&gt;House Building down by 15k

Don't really see where you're getting that number from in that excel file. From [here](http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/feb/19/new-build-houses-falls-short-despite-small-increase) and [here](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Housing-Regeneration/HSfS/NewBuild), the percentage fall from peak strikes me as being roughly the same 39% for the whole UK against 40% for Scotland alone. How much can you really blame the SNP for a global financial recession, credit crunches, etc.?

&gt;But SNP are good at blaming England so that's nice.

I agree he's probably asking for more than he's worth. I feel agents may be influencing this, although everything at this point is speculation. No fan knows the full situation, which is why I feel sorry for him. He's exactly two months younger than I am, and I sure as hell would hate being criticised by the press and by former club legends, as well as having the fans being hostile, when no one knows what's going on. Again, it's not like Sterling's been an angel, but having Anfield chant ""Raheem Sterling you're agents a nob"" a few days after he'd expressed how much he dreamed of having his own song has got to be pretty disheartening. 

I feel like this sub (which is supposed to be more level headed than normal) has been pretty reactionary and turned against him of late. However, the above reasons would definitely be enough to make any player fall out of form, let alone a 20 year old kid.

Let's not forget that earlier in the season, he was far and away our best player. He had some stunning individual performances and seemed our biggest goal threat after Sturridge went down. Remember,,Coutinho, who is now the darling of the sub, was pretty dire in the first half of the season and got dropped from the first team. Now he's in form and everyone loves him while Sterling has been hung out to dry. (Not hating on Coutinho by any means but just trying to point out how fickle football is).

I know the circumstances have been different, in that Coutinho signed his contract and got on with the game while Sterling has been a lot more outspoken, but this shouldn't be unforgivable. Sterling went from being our best player to being played out of positing (striker and wing-back, two roles he's very unfamiliar with) which has severely hindered him even if it did improve the team. No wonder he's frustrated. 

I know it sounds like I'm making a lot of excuses for him, but I feel, at 20 years old and already over 100 appearances for the club, he might be entitled to a few. This guy was outplaying Luis Fucking Suarez at the end of last season, and I want to see him get back to that level with us.

If we got a crazy bid in for him then I imagine we'll accept, and I would understand it. But if it does happen, I'll be very sad to lose such a talented, young player. And even sadder because I'm pretty sure I'll end up reading comments on here along the lines of ""Good riddance"" which would be very reactionary and short sighted.

&gt;I am Scottish but i have been living in England for the last 20 years

I am English but I have been living in Scotland for the last 25 years. I'm not sure if that makes me count more or less for OP's question than you but I'm pretty glad that the SNP are around. It's so strange: almost every Scot living in England seems to detest the SNP with a venom that the average English person doesn't quite possess. It makes me think of ex-smokers somehow. 

I don't by any means think that the SNP are the kind of a liberal-left that they are painted: they're very centrist and have an authoritarian streak, but probably less so than either of the two main parties. What they are doing which is good for the country however is providing a counterpoint which would be sorely missing without them: for better or worse they've managed to pull together the idea of progressive politics and make this election one worth having, and one where at least in Scotland there is real debate about alternatives. 

I find it really interesting that Scots living in England are often so angry about them. Here, it's much more mixed: there are of course English-born people who are vehemently anti-independence but many like me see the chance to build a more rested country if the conditions are right. So I'm not one of those (ex-)English people and I find it increasingly hard to just call myself ""English"". I've adopted Scotland as much as it is adopted me, and can assure you that the mood up here is not to blame England but to blame Westminster for the terrible morass that we're all in.

If you plan to only move when you have kids, you'll need a property close to good state schools or you will need the money to pay for private education (£15-25K in London/year starting from age of 4 or 5). You'll need to factor that in to your search, proximity to a good state school could add up to £50-150K to the value of the home in London. I find locrating.com a good resource.

I can't be sure of the future but I doubt you'll see house values plummeting in the rich areas like Fulham because the owners just won't sell them and the price will instead stay stagnant. Brixton on the other hand is over-hyped IMHO but it's pretty close to the city centre.

Scotland spends a lot of time conplaining that they never vote tory. They are correct. This is why they have won an independent  parliament etc. 

What you are suggesting is the rest of the UK has given a mandate to a party they are not even allowed to vote for if they wanted to. No that is in no way democracy. 

It is the view of scotland. It is a mandate within scotland. It is in no way a mandate for the UK. As the vast majority of the UK will have voted for something different. 

By definition 10% of seats cannot be a mandate when 90% are not even allowed to vote for them. And when most of that 90% have voted for the oppisite.

Regarding how much they effect the overall unemployment numbers, well these contracts now employ about half a million people more than they did a few years ago. A decent proportion but we'd still have falling unemployment without them.

Also there is nothing wrong with zero hour contracts, per se. They are a bit of a political football but they exist for a reason. Don't buy into the spin. The fact is most zero hour contract workers are happy with their employment. For example:

&gt;zero-hours workers were just as satisfied with their job as the average UK employee (60 per cent and 59 per cent respectively), and more likely to be happy with their worklife balance than other workers (65 per cent versus 58 per cent).

And since the Tories wouldn't be able to actually form a government in the event Ed resigns, that could lead to a new election with the fact that the SNP opened the door for the Tories fresh in voters heads.

There are always businesses that aren't doing as well, some big, some small. Just because some aren't doing well doesn't mean the economy hasn't recovered.

&gt; Private corporations pay far less tax, proportionally, even when they are paying as much as they should be, so profits don't necessarily translate to economic recovery.

Eh? I have no idea what point you are trying to make there. You're saying corporations pay less tax than individuals? Well yeah. Corporation tax is 20%. Individuals starts at 20% (after tax-free allowance), rising to 40-50% plus NI. I'm not sure what point you're trying to make there though - that corporations are bad? That they're not paying their way? Government sets the tax rate based on their budget.

In reality though, you should bear in mind that corporations don't really pay any tax - their *shareholders and employees pay tax*. If a corporation wants to avoid tax, they can just engage in heavy capital expenditure and run their profits down to zero, or pay out bonuses to their staff and likewise run down their profits with an inflated payroll - of course the staff will be paying tax on those payouts...

Bear in mind that dividends come from *post-tax profits*, and are themselves subject to tax. So the tax man gets two bites of the cake there - they tax the company profits, and then if the company pays a dividend, the shareholders have to stump up a chunk of tax as well.

Tax on dividends is between 10% and 37.5%, so it's entirely possible that the taxman can actually clear 50% of a company's profits if the company pays 20% on the first pass, pays all the remainder out as dividend and it's shareholders then lose 37.5% on the second pass.",null,0,null,1430814973,null,0,1432136074,0,cqywmsi,null,t3_3492re,null,t1_cqywmsi,null,t1_cqvajel,null,null,null,1432780408,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Now you are just expanding on your point. I would argue that these poor people are still going to be hit hard by higher energy prices even if insulation etc is improved in their homes. Also, the cost of doing this would be ridiculous! How would the government be able to afford all these home improvements? Improving home insulation etc doesn't drive energy bills down to zero.

I decided to go for the cheaper option than a 20S or SMH-10. I've only used it a couple of times so far but it's very good. The sound quality is very good and it handles bassy music quite well (although I'm still debating whether I should ride with music or not). It connected to my iPhone easily and allows me to use Siri, and use my tomtom app, I still don't have a mount for my phone so I have been keeping the phone in my pocket and just listening to the directions. 

I will be buying a second 3S for my girlfriend for rider to pillion comms which this unit is designed for, Rider to rider is probably a no no due to the short range of this device.

So far I have used Siri for starting a couple of voice calls and for checking the weather while on the move. Installation was a lot easier than I was expecting it to be although my only negative about the product is the bulky speakers... In the 3S the speakers also contain the devices battery so are quite thick and in my AGV K4 helmet without speaker cut outs I can really feel the speakers behind the padding... I am sure this will change over time as the padding wears down.

null,false,mkernow,null,null,null,"Definitely take the larger property; it's got a larger value, so even if doing it up and renting it out becomes a burden to you, you can sell it on yourself and find a simpler way to invest the money.

Rental agencies do different sorts of packages. A more expensive sort of package would include them handling the logistics of all problems arising - e.g. the boiler stops working. Probably worth paying for it if you're not wanting to spend too much time yourself on managing the property. Also, when you are renting it, you want to automatically deduct about 1/6th of the rent and put it in an account dedicated for repairs and so on.

The most expensive things to update in a house are the kitchen and bathroom, so updating bedrooms shouldn't be too much. I couldn't really give a price, but a lick of paint and a new carpet and some ikea furniture doesn't add up to much.

It sounds like there are a lot of family connections going on. Property and money are the no.1 cause of families arguing, so whatever you think is the best option, make sure your mother, sister etc. are on exactly the same page. I'd also make sure that the properties are legally in your/your sisters names. There's a chance that your mum might be looking towards her retirement pot and she might decide in 5 years that actually she wants to sell the house and take the cash for herself. Just get everything sown up and discuss all possible exigencies.

Remember to keep a minimum of 3 months living expenses as liquid cash in your bank account in case of emergencies. 

I wonder, what's going to happen to the property that you don't take on? If I were in your situation I'd want to take both, even if that meant having a 'mortgage' to my mum.

Also, remember that you don't need to stick with your own bank if you are looking for credit, definitely shop around. Whilst you'll get a better % rate if the loan is a mortgage secured against the property itself, if you're just needing money to do-up the properties, it might be less hassle to get a personal loan, either from the bank or from a reputable, flexible, low-interest lender like ratesetter.com or zopa.com. An independent personal financial adviser would probably be more use than someone at the bank, since they have no vested interests in selling you a particular product, and bank-workers are often forbidden from giving financial advice, even if it's common sense.

Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988:

&gt;s. 16 (1) The owner of the copyright in a work has, in accordance with the following provisions of this Chapter, the exclusive right to do the following acts in the United Kingdom:

&gt;  (a)to copy the work (see section 17);

&gt;...

&gt; (2) Copyright in a work is infringed by a person who without the licence of the copyright owner does, or authorises another to do, any of the acts restricted by the copyright.

&gt;s. 17 (2) Copying in relation to a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work means reproducing the work in any material form. 


The question of distribution/publication is covered by section 18:

&gt;18 Infringement by issue of copies to the public.

&gt; (1)The issue to the public of copies of the work is an act restricted by the copyright in every description of copyright work.

&gt;(2) References in this Part to the issue to the public of copies of a work are to:

&gt;(a)the act of putting into circulation in the EEA copies not previously put into circulation in the EEA by or with the consent of the copyright owner, or

&gt;(3) References in this Part to the issue to the public of copies of a work do not include:

&gt;...

&gt;(b)any subsequent importation of such copies into the United Kingdom or another EEA state,except so far as paragraph (a) of subsection (2) applies to putting into circulation in the EEA copies previously put into circulation outside the EEA.]

So, to summarise:

s. 16 and 17 make creating a copy a breach of copyright.

s. 18 says that issuing copies to the public is a breach when it 'first' happens.  However redistributing such copies is not a breach, unless the redistribution is of items previously only published outside of Europe.

In your case, since the items are being imported and then distributed by you, this probably counts as publication in the EEA and would be a breach. If the company imported them into Europe, then sold them to you (within Europe) it would be their liability.

England is wealthy. Good for England. How is that relevant?

Progressive policies such as no tuition fees, a commitment to stop privatisation of the NHS, a moratorium on fracking, free prescriptions, scrapping trident, removing  the bedroom tax, reducing welfare cuts etc. These are policies of the SNP and policies that Scotland support.

The consequence is that the public can't be trusted by politicians or civil servants. Then they do things like cover up child abuse or claim expenses and the public feels we can't trust them.

Most politicians barely seem to trust the other members of their own party.
So, with absolutely no trust between or within organisations the only value that people have left is loyalty. I.e. you can't trust someone to have integrity but you can trust them to be on *your* side.

How can you run a society without trust? Enforce loyalty through constant propaganda.
*You're British, dontcha know*, this obvious fact needs reasserting over otherwise people might question whether those that can't be trusted are worth any form of loyalty.

&gt;I guess those protesters against Freddie Gray's death need to get a grip. There's no way 6 police officers would be charged in the UK for an accident like that.

I personally know a copper who recently stood trial for GBH when a custody ended up with a serious head injury. He was found not guilty (and is one of the reasons the Met are fitting CCTV to their vans. It would never have gone to trial if it had been available).

The DPS (Department of Professional Standards, in the met, PSD elsewhere) will never hesitate to stick a copper on. The CPS will cheerfully authorise a charge against a copper, sometimes with no regard to the evidence.

There is no culture of silence or any sort of conspiracy to protect police officers in the UK. If the Freddy Gray matter happened in the UK, then any officer within earshot would have been suspended. The van would have been put out of use and the IDR downloaded (showing everything the van was doing, down to whether or not the heating was on). I'd be very surprised if the driver and the escorting officer weren't nicked at the time.

Now, you're clearly incensed that coppers aren't being found culpable for deaths in custody (for apparently given values of custody), so here's something for you to consider:

*what if the police aren't actually culpable?*

Let's look at 2013/14, using the [IPCC report.](https://www.ipcc.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Documents/research_stats/Deaths_Report_1314.pdf)

The deaths involved eleven men between 31 &amp; 70, ten of whom were white and one of whom was of dual heritage. 

Seven died *in* a custody suite:

* Three men, all of whom were apparently intoxicated on arrest, died after becoming unresponsive while in a police cell. In each case, an ambulance was called, but they all died at the police station with medics in attendance. Causes of death for these men were: respiratory failure; acute alcohol toxicity with alcoholic steatohepatitis, hypertensive heart disease, obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus; and suspected sudden seizure. 
* Two men died after they had been taken to a police custody suite having been detained under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act
* Both men had been restrained by police. One man was restrained using handcuffs, leg restraints and a spit hood, which was later replaced by a body cuff. The other man was physically restrained and had handcuffs and leg restraints applied. Both were taken ill while in custody and were transferred to hospital by ambulance where they died later that day. The cause of death is awaited for both men.
* One man was taken ill following his arrival in custody. He was taken to hospital by ambulance where he died two days later; the cause of death was cocaine, amphetamine and butylone toxicity.
* One man, who was intoxicated, was arrested for threats to kill and taken into custody. During a cell check, officers raised concerns about his breathing and an ambulance was called. He was taken to hospital where his death was subsequently confirmed. The cause of death is
currently awaited.

In an ideal world, the two s136 detainees should have been in an NHS setting. However, the police are permitted to use a custody suite as a place of safety under the terms of that act, but it should be the last resort. The restraints used suggest that they posed a risk that could only be managed in a police setting, but have absolutely no doubt that their detention would have been challenged by the custody officer, and that detention would have been closely reviewed with a view to getting them into a healthcare setting as quickly as is possible. You may enjoy the blog of the [Mental Health Cop](http://mentalhealthcop.wordpress.com) for more on the challenges that come from the collision of the criminal justice system and the mental health world. 

Two men died whilst being arrested:

* One man was arrested for being drunk and incapable. The man appeared unresponsive to officers’ instructions and they were unable to rouse him. Officers called for an ambulance and he was pronounced dead at the scene. His cause of death is awaited.
* An ambulance was called to attend a road traffic incident where an elderly man was found unwell in the driver’s seat of a car. Police were called to assist as the man was refusing medical treatment; he was then arrested for road traffic related offences. Due to concerns
about his health, he was transported by ambulance to hospital where he died the following morning. The pathologist reported the cause of death to be bronchopneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and dementia. The inquest determined the cause of death to be natural causes.

And finally, two men died after being taken ill in a police vehicle:

* One man was a passenger in a car that was stopped by police officers as part of a preplanned operation. The man was arrested and, following a struggle, he was physically restrained by officers and placed in a police van. En route to the police station the man became
unwell and the vehicle was diverted to hospital where he died. The cause of death was recorded as cocaine toxicity.
* One man was arrested for theft after being detained by security guards. Officers became concerned about his health while he was in the back of a police vehicle. An ambulance was called and he was taken to hospital where he later died. The cause of death is awaited.

People who routinely come into contact with the police are often very unwell people leading chaotic lives. Alcohol and drug abuse plays a major part in their life stories, and these people can become ill very quickly.

I don't know how familiar you are with custody procedure, but I can tell you that custody officers are *very* risk averse. They will not hesitate to call a doctor (you try getting a house visit from a GP within an hour, you'll see a doctor much quicker in custody) or an ambulance, or require officers to attend A&amp;E with the prisoner prior to arrival. The CCTV records both audio and video and covers anywhere where a prisoner might be, except the room used for a strip search (and if that's a cell, the monitor will be turned off for the search). 

But none of that makes for compelling reading. ""Man gets arrested, is released in better nick than when he arrived"" doesn't attract the clicks.

You could chunter and moan about police brutality in custody, or you could actually do something about it by becoming an [Independent Custody Visitor](http://www.icva.org.uk/). Every custody suite, from a TACT suite, to Charing Cross to the smallest nick in deepest, darkest Ruralshire has them. I suspect that you'll find the truth to be significantly duller than you expect, but there is no better way to advocate on behalf of detainees (even if they despise you as much as they despise the coppers, but you can't win 'em all).

You could also volunteer for the [Independent Monitoring Board](http://www.imb.org.uk/) who have a similar role for prisons and immigration facilities, which I think would be much more interesting.

null,false,Kenpachi-,null,null,null,"What are the realistic ways this will play out?

Going by the predicted figures:

&amp;nbsp;


From the sounds of things, the Lib Dems (26 seats) look most likely to engage in another coalition deal with the Conservatives (281 seats) to ""finish the job"" for a total of 307 seats. Add the DUP (8 seats) then thats 315.

&amp;nbsp;

On the other hand, the SNP (51 seats), the Greens (1 seat), Plaid Cymru (4 seats) and the SDLP  (3 seats) would all oppose the Tories.  Thats 59 seats, plus Labour's 267 seats giving 326 seats that would potentially back a Labour minority government  and/or block a Tory government.  Can the Conservatives realistically form the next government?

&amp;nbsp;

The other thing that I don't understand is that Labour have come out strongly to say that they wouldn't work with the SNP.  So if Scotland overwhelmingly elect SNP candidates in nearly all of their constituencies and Labour refuse to work with them, will that not be a disaster for the union?  What would refusing to work for the SNP do for the the future of the Labour party if it lets the Conservatives in again?

&amp;nbsp;

The only potential out I can see is for the Lib Dems to flip and join Labour -- neutralising the power the SNP could potentially have over Labour by helping them get ahead of the Tories. Scotland could probably live with a Labour led government, but I doubt they could live with a Tory led one.  In a HoC that looks like it will have an anti-Tory majority is that a likely outcome?

However the BoE weren't the culprits running the presses, it was the Japanese.

The US market got inflated with all this free money then under Bush the market got softer as all that cash had to find a place to live. Interest rates dropped because the BoJ money was distorting US returns and the UK just followed them down that road.

These events are rooted in history, in this case they stretch back decades to Japan's collapse in the late 80s. They don't just spontaneously appear out of nowhere.

If you mean does the number of times you check your own credit report effect anything then the answer is no.  The fact you've checked is recorded but it's not shared with anyone else checking your report.  this is sometimes referred to as a ""soft"" check - soft checks are also created by institutions accessing your credit file for non-lending purposes, like ID verification.  The opposite is a ""hard"" check which is created when your file is checked for a lending decision. Hard checks are visible to others and too many of them in a short space of time can be an issue.

2 of my friends got their job through family, in the sense they put a word in to get them a summer job and they were offered a job after uni. They worked their way up on their own from there. TBH they didn't really need a helping hand, it's a big employer in my town. 

Apart from that none of us were born with anything remotely resembling a silver spoon. I earn more than both my parents put together, they couldn't give me a leg up even if they wanted to. 

Luck is a part, but IMO being able to keep going with all the rejections is what makes the luck. Moving to where the work is helps. The friend who is doing the worst career wise stayed in her small town (and doesn't drive). Everyone else moved to London/cities.

It's not that the EU tailors to the UK needs, rather works on the premise that what is good for the EU as a whole (as they see it) follows that it must be good for its constituent members.  But not all economies in the EU are indicative of each other.  What is good for a Mediterranean economy might not be good for a Scandinavian economy, or vice versa.

This way, outside the EU, the negotiation would be 1:1.

The other aspect is that this isn't just a free trade deal.  The level of secrecy has gone beyond that, but from information we have been made privy to, it is looking more like a proto-single market deal, and once you sign into that, and ratify it (which is never going to happen with TTIP), then you're effectively locked into  it unless you can get all the other members to agree to renegotiate.  Not so with a 1:1 deal.

The third point being if it is 1:1 not only would our own government have to ratify it (which is why the likes of Switzerland, Iceland, New Zealand are able to make deals with China, India, Canada where the EU has struggled), so it could actually be passed, the following government as sovereign would be able to renegotiate it the people/government decided so without having to get an EU consensus.

Now, instead of looking like a single market deal, we'd be negotiating a pure free trade deal, US-UK tailored around reducing tariffs, but where we wouldn't be beholden to supranational jurisdiction beyond the WTO.  In 2000 there was  a US Senate report commissioned by then-US Senator Phil Gramm which concluded that there was potential for a UK entry into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  The same deal Canada and Mexico have, but again there's no need for the UK to even settle for that.


There's even now the argument that outside the EU we wouldn't need a US free trade deal because it would put a Global Free Trade Deal back on the table where we do what Singapore has done and just scrap all our tariffs and announce ourselves as a truly global market place.  And that's starting to look VERY promising:

Say an energy company connected too many people to their power grid. They were all told not to use more than a certain amount of electricity in a big list of terms and conditions and it wasn't explained to them that this might cause a big global energy crisis. Then the grid shuts down and explodes because of the overuse.

It's not fair to blame the people in this scenario. Someone came and sold them electricity. You all have electricity in your house. Is it safe? Do you know if all your house is wired up correctly? 

Hopefully the analogy works. I'm sure someone is gonna call me an idiot and pick it apart. Which is fine.

I think it's implying they will either hire you as a PAYE employee who is directly employed by the company for £19.27 an hour gross, or employ you through a company as a contractor for £24.62 gross an hour.

The former gives you significantly more security and will likely come with benefits attached from working directly for the company. This will include pension schemes and the like. It also means they can't terminate you at the drop of a hat after your initial probation period.

The latter rate would requre you to form a Ltd company where you are the director. The company is then employed to do the work and you, as an agent of that company, perform the task. You would be responsible for paying your NI, tax, and submitting accounts every year for this company, or paying an accountant to do this for you. You would also be subject to being terminated much more easily, and no benefits the company provides (such as a pension scheme) would apply to you. 

You can pay a lower rate of tax through a Ltd company by paying yourself in certain methods.

You wold most certianly be better off forming a ltd company and working that way, but whether the hassles of doing your own accounts each year, sorting out the administraiton, and forfeiting benefits such as a pension scheme is worth it to you, is something you'd have to decide.

Cech is a complete no-brainer. 

Back four is pretty much spot on, but Gallas is missing and he's one of the best all-round defenders to ever wear a Chelsea shirt.

Midfield considerations, both ahead of Willian at the moment would be Essien and Ballack, but Makelele and Lampard are no-brainers.

Robben was ridiculously good when he was on it, but as players in that role are often inconsistent it makes it harder. Duff was more consistent, arguably, but not as gifted. Also probably the last outright winger we had at the club and already struggling when he left. Joe Cole was one of the most naturally talented players I've ever seen play for Chelsea, but he had only two seasons at the top of his game and I had far too much man-love for the bloke. If pushed, I'd replace Robben with Duff.

Drogba's easy if we're going for a lone striker, but I can only dream of the destruction Jimmy and Eidur would wreak with the sort of service they'd get from our current squad, more's the pity.

It felt wrong to wait until 7pm to answer this, seeing as you're right here in Bridgend anyway!

My name is David, I'm on the Broadlands where I built my home back in the early 2000s back when it was mostly fields. I understand people in Bridgend are often stuck between getting a commuting job in Swansea or a commuting job in Cardiff (I've had both) and our party has a lot of solutions to that - such as encouraging remote working to solve both our population and congestion issues in cities as well as providing a healthier lifestyle for employees. Of course this means our broadband infrastructure needs to really catch up with Europe.

Here are some specific Bridgend-Policies as well as some pledges that set me apart from the other Candidates here:

https://wales.pirateparty.org.uk/spokesperson-for-wales/bridgend/

If the above link is a bit tl;dr for you, then in a nut shell:

No fracking

Better Recycling (to reduce littler and collections)

No Dog Fowling - especially on the school run areas

Porthcawl seafront regeneration

More Schools - bigger schools, smaller class sizes

Better road infrastructure (we've had something like a 50% population boom in 10 years or something rediculous but the roads and rail have barely been touched)

Mobile signal dead zones eliminated

Highest crime in Bridgend is anti-social behaviour - so better community cohesion is needed (though we are a bit lucky there - as in my last town in Barry, store crime was a big one and in St Athan, it's car crime, which is where I also frequently visit).

&gt;

&gt;__Harry Stanley__ (ca. 1953 – 22 September 1999) was a painter and decorator who was shot and killed by British armed police in contentious circumstances. Initially his death was recorded with an open verdict, before being ruled as unlawful killing by a jury on appeal and finally returned to an open verdict by the high court.

Levy small (max 15%) national income tax and capital gains tax to fund military, foreign policy, central government and so on. 

* Replace *all* forms of welfare with negative income tax or basic income, depending on economic viability.  Offer some, extremely limited, 'top up program' for those whose disabilities require extra funding.  

* Legalise all Class-C drugs, form committee to investigate partial legalisation of most other narcotics.  

* Fully legalise prostitution, including brothels and advertising of sex work

* Investigate full repeal of all government legislation concerning 'offensive' or 'hate' speech.  Maintain laws governing specific *threats* against individuals or communities.  

* Tax owners of properties who DO NOT live in the UK permanently at 2% of property value per year. 

* Reform planning permission- provide massive incentives for building industry to purchase new land by *guaranteeing* planning permission on it, then encourage building now by taxing unused commercial property.  

* Establish a free-enterprise zone in impoverished Northern English cities and the Welsh Valleys, lowering corporation tax for companies employing more than a certain number of workers there, and lowering income tax for those who live there more than 260 days per year.  Use some federal tax revenues to make up for budget shortfall in these regions until economic development makes them revenue-neutral. 

* Can all existing rail development programs.  Legislate that all mainline, intercity rail developments above £5Bn must now be designed for high-speed, maglev trains running above 550kph. 

* Pursue free movement of capital and labour throughout the Realms of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, UK and potentially Singapore. 

* Impose heavy restrictions on immigration from countries with non-Western culture, unless they are proven to be extremely economically useful.   Additionally, all Asylum Seekers must now be individually approved by the Home Secretary, and numbers to be slashed by 90-95%.  This is to discourage the horrific practices by those attempting to cross the Mediterranean today in hope of asylum here.   Those found illegally are to be immediately deported to their country of origin, regardless of what may happen on arrival, without exception, *unless* government intelligence believes they are a valuable asset. 

* By contrast, encourage immigration from other Western, and in particular Anglosphere countries with whom we share our culture.  

* Massively increase contribution to the European Space Agency in return for bringing more research, development and manufacturing facilities into the UK. 

* Remove restrictions on advertising certain products deemed 'bad' by the central government, such as tobacco and alcohol.  Consumers should be free to make up their own mind.  Government anti-smoking/drinking campaigns would continue to run.    

* Pursue a British Constitution guaranteeing the constitutional monarchy, right to freely trade, sell and employ, right to own property, right to free speech without safeguards, right to bodily autonomy, and so on.   Require an 80% parliamentary majority to overturn or modify.  

* Reform capital gains tax law to encourage employee ownership in their companies.

I follow PSG very closely, have seen all their games this campaign, and Pastore was one of PSG's hallmark signings. He was supposed to signal that PSG were a serious team who would not just buy old superstars, a la the MLS, but would get young, promising players. 

This season, when actually given time, he's become quite the mind behind PSG's attack. If PSG get di Maria or de Bruyne - as is rumored - there's a possibility Pastore could want to go. But I doubt he'd come to us and I doubt we could afford him. He'd fit perfect as a LM for us though.

     Pastore - Eriksen - Lamela 

        Bentaleb - Schneiderlin 

That makes my body happy.

Cabaye is someone I'd feel nervous about Tottenham signing. I'll be honest, he's been really shit this year for PSG. This is not totally his fault, though. He doesn't get the time to settle in. He's thrown in for a game here, a game there, pretty much when Verratti has accumulated too many yellow cards. Even then, Rabiot (who is going to be incredible in 5 years) is preferred and, honestly, is much better. 

I think, given time, Cabaye could find his spot in our team. But he does do the same job as Nabil.

It's all well and good saying that non-physical means are the best way of dealing with a dementia patient that is confused, aggressive etc. but I can assure you that when all methods of keeping the patient calm, particularly when the time has come for some sort of medical intervention, transport to hospital etc, there's sometimes no avoiding the fact that the patient is going to kick off, lash out etc.  

Specially trained staff, as mentioned in this article, aren't always available.  The reality is dementia is a very challenging and very common condition and unless you plan on specially training every single nurse, paramedic or doctor in techniques that may or may not always work then some level of restraint is going to be required.  Perhaps some hospitals have been overusing physical restraint, I can't really comment on that but haven't witnessed it myself, but to suggest that resorting to it is some kind of failure is a bit disingenuous imo.

I refer you to [someone cleverer than myself](http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=342011) who said it better:

&gt; An analogy is not supposed to be exactly like the analogous situation. Then there would be no point to the analogy, it would just be a thing that is the same as the other thing, and serve no rhetorical purpose whatsofuckingever. The whole fucking point of an analogy is that it is similar in key respects to the original topic at hand, while differing in others. A skilfully constructed analogy may wildly differ in many other, hopefully tangential, aspects, which are likely chosen to highlight a key point in the argument about the original topic.

&gt; One of those aspects may well be (wait for it ... ) degree!

&gt; Yes, degree. Yes, an analogy may well present a comparable but worse case in order to highlight the moral question at the core of the discussion. Nazis and rape may well be involved. Maybe Tom Jones will proposition a stagehand, and things will get completely WACKY! The point of this madcap zaniness is to make you think about your position in the original context, and examine what it is in the analogous situation that makes you change your mind. This may or may not be successful, but what it is not supposed to do is present two entirely identical situations which reinforce your previously-held conviction about what is right. That would be fucking stupid.

&gt; Now, it may be (indeed, it is likely) the case that the analogy presented is fucking stupid. For that matter, I may well follow up this rant with one about Fucking Stupid Analogies, which will likely draw heavily on filesharing debates. Fucking Stupid Analogies deserve the scorn they draw, for they differ in just about every possible way from the original situation, and are thus, as I say, Fucking Stupid.

Littlejohn used a Fucking Stupid Analogy, with a deliberate insinuating association with something shocking, but it nonetheless remains an analogy not a comparison.",null,0,null,1430830086,null,0,false,0,cqz0i5v,null,t3_34x1pz,null,t1_cqz0i5v,null,t1_cqyztqz,null,null,null,1432782233,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

Have they?  Well, it's easy enough to check.  Search 'Rotherham' in this subreddit and show me where 'many people' have attributed it exclusively to PC.

I've just done exactly that - and whilst I see plenty of people talking about political correctness, I've yet to see one commenter claim that PC was the sole cause.

The closest I found was [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2emih6/1400_children_abused_in_rotherham/ck0w6xu) by /u/mao_was_right:

&gt;Welcome to the brave new world brought to us by the modern wave of tip-toeing, voice-silencing and various other forms of political correctness. Police are too scared to be called racists; 1400 children get raped. Congratulations.

So, yes - the poster is claiming that without PC, this wouldn't have happened, but even he/she isn't explicitly claiming it was the only factor.

But, I'm sure you have better examples, given that you're the one making the claim.

Example 'AM' day 1

- Full cleanse or swipe with a gentle wipe depending what my skin needs

- gentle AB toner

- enzyme exfoliant (before mask, because water helps it work)

- apply hydrogel or silk sheet mask

- wait time

- non-acid vitamin C lotion mixed with a niacinamide lotion

- wait time

- sunscreen

Example 'AM' day 2

- Full cleanse or swipe with a gentle wipe depending what my skin needs

- 10% CE ferulic serum (also lightly exfoliates)

- wait time

- gentle AB toner

- gentle AB essence

- light gel-cream moisturiser

- antioxidant rich moisturiser

Example 'PM' routine

- Full cleanse or swipe with a gentle wipe depending what my skin needs

- gentle AB toner

- gentle AB essence

- retinol product (so applied close to bare skin)

- wait time

- another gentle AB toner

- another gentle AB essence

- face oil blend

- wait time

- moisturiser containing niacinamide.

There are often a lot of wait times and sometimes AM and PM merge into one - this is down to my lifestyle/ health issues.

1. Over donating to the same thing, e.g. 5 philanthropists may help one chariity and exceed it's needs by 5x, rather than being 'smart' and helping 5 charities.

2. Lack of coverage - if you have a state that is responsible, they have to view the whole picture. Philanthropy will not provide this 'full coverage' - think of a state army vs. private security. Only a comprehensive strategy can give the full coverage against ALL threats.

3. Human biases - animal charities receive an order of magnitude more donations (~£50m+) than mental health charities (£~5m), despite mental health problems costing the UK aroudn £200bn a year.

This precipitated a club record move to [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England) club [Middlesbrough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlesbrough_F.C.) in January 2008. Alves has been [capped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport\)) for [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team) on eight occasions.

**The Hyundai i30**. One of the best and worst things about this car is that it depreciates very quickly - you'll lose lots of money if you buy new, but if you get a second-hand example you could save a fortune! Plump for the 1.6 petrol (though if you can get the 1.4 very cheap, it does the job!) We drove it: http://www.carbuyer.co.uk/reviews/hyundai/i30/hatchback/review

**The Ford Fiesta**. It's the most popular car in the UK for a reason - it just works. It's fun to drive, cheap to buy and generally pretty practical. We like it a lot. The 1.0 petrol Ecoboost engine costs pennies to run and has plenty of oomph for most drivers. This is an inexpensive car to buy, run and maintain. If you have a need for speed, get the Fiesta ST - brilliant little hot hatch. Our thoughts: http://www.carbuyer.co.uk/reviews/ford/fiesta/hatchback/review

**The Citroen C4 Cactus**. It looks, to be honest, pretty odd. But it's a practical, efficient and fun car that (Citroen claims) won't get dented as much in carparks. What's more, it handles quite nicely and is a doddle to drive. (And when you start it up, the dashboard has old-skool swooshy lights like Tron or something). It's very efficient and light.

So, if a poster claims that PC was an instrumental factor that's the same as claiming it's *entirely* due to PC?  That there can be no other factors such as police incompetence?

I don't think so.

Is that comment logically the same as the claim that PC was the *only* factor?  I don't think so.  

And note that the reply following directly puts the point that PC was not the only factor.  Seems like a healthy debate to me.

I agree that there were people who emphasized PC as the key factor, just like there were others who emphasized police incompetence or other factors.  But I still think it's exaggerating a bit to claim that there were many who claimed that Rotherham was due to one factor alone.

But isn't that always the way in reddit debates?  Practically everything is a mix of factors and people always feel that to emphasize X means you're minimizing Y and Z or that because Y has been shown to be a factor then somehow this means that X and Z can't also have contributed.

&gt;

&gt;A __protected view__ or __protected vista__ is the legal requirement within [urban planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning) to preserve the view of a specific place or historic building from another location. The effect of a protected view is to limit the height of new buildings within or adjacent to the sightline between the two places so as to preserve the ability to see the landmark as a focus of the view. The protection may also cover the area behind the place or building concerned.

&gt;For example, in [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London) views of [St Paul's Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral)  are protected from various prominent locations around the city. In [Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh), a 2005 skyline study compiled a list of almost 170 key views which will now be protected in the planning process. 

&gt;Protected views are not unique to the [UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom), also existing in places such as [San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco) which has some of the strictest limits in the world;  [Portland, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon) where the size of downtown blocks is kept low to maintain the views of [Mount Hood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Hood) from the West Hills; and the city of [Vancouver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver) which has protected ""view cones"".

If Sturridge had been fit this season or we had another striker for him to play off his stats this season would be much higher.

So I went through the game of 20 questions with the guy on the line and came out with a quote that was over 2 times higher - oops!

While I was still on the phone, I went back to the comparison website and clicked around enough that the quote got through to the CN computers. The guy I was talking to went through confirming the details for this quote (they were all the same as before), paid the lower price and got my insurance!

His systems wouldn't even let him attempt to compete on price with their own policy :-/

Often these companies are open to remote working as they understand it saves office space and reduces a sickness record.

It would also cut down on flexible working agreements being necessary as the remote employee can balance home-work life easier.

As for what to see, that depends on a lot of things. What are you interested in seeing? Is there a particular period of history you specifically want to see stuff from, for example? Do you have an interest in, eg, trains, cars, historic warfare, sports etc that would mean you'd want to specifically visit museums covering those interests? How are you travelling - by public transport or by car?

If you make it to Shropshire, some of our best tourist attractions include:

* Ludlow Castle. It's a really good castle. Towers, funny little rooms, lots to explore, and they usually have some good events on over the summer.

* Highley Engine Shed. A train museum with historic steam engines and carriages, including, last time I went, King George VI's carriage from WWII. Best way to get there is by steam train from Bridgnorth. You can see the railway line and passing trains from the cafe there too.

* Wroxeter. Ancient Roman fort and subsequently city. Not a huge amount remains, but there's a big old bit of bath house wall that's survived, and a few years ago a Roman villa was built there too. Good museum, good audio-guide. English Heritage site, so if you're going to a lot of those, it might be worth getting membership.

* Ironbridge Gorge Museums. There are several. Ironbridge is a hub of Industrial era history. It's got the Iron Bridge, for a start. There's also Blist's Hill, a living Victorian town which is really cool. If you go, get old timey money at the bank to spend in the pub, sweetshop, etc. Note: Ironbridge is *not* in Telford, no matter what Telfordites tell you.

* Shrewsbury Museum and Art Gallery. Really good museum. Pretty extensive collection covering a pretty extensive history. It's got giant deer antlers from an extinct species of deer from the Ice Age. Also covers: geological eras of pre-human past; Roman period; medieval period including Cadfael even though he's fictional; early modern clothing and ceramics. When I last went they had an Egypt exhibit too.

* Kinver Rock Houses (this might not be quite inside Shropshire, I can't remember). Cave houses that were occupied right up til the 1960s. Pretty weird. There's also a bronze age hill fort just up the hill from them which has pretty amazing views and makes a nice walk.

* The Wrekin. If you like a hike, and have an interest in iron age hill forts, this is a good bet. Pretty stunning views from the top.

* Much Wenlock. There's a medieval priory that's well worth a visit, but the town itself is nice too. Small and quaint. The Guildhall is a little museum with some interesting stuff too. And there are loads of small independent shops. Check out the smoothie place on the square, it's good.

* Bridgnorth. Aside from the steam railway station (where there's a good pub called the Railwayman's Arms), there's also a cliff railway, a mostly blown up castle, and a rather weird town hall right in the middle of the High Street. There's also a very small museum in Northgate (big sandstone gate one end of the High Street, can't miss it). Highlights include the Catch Me Who Can ice cream, named after the prototype locomotive which was built in Bridgnorth, available at Knickerbocker's at the bottom of Cartway, facing the bridge.

There are similarities here to the Suarez situation. It was clear that he wanted to leave but we managed to get another season out of him and we nearly won the league. 

We need to hang on to our best players for as long as we can. It's all well and good saying we'll get 50m for him and we can buy Depay and Lacazette. That's not going to happen and even if it does there's no guarantee that big money players are going to adapt to the premier league. Look at Falcao and Di Maria. We didn't exactly invest the Suarez money in the best way either.

Here's the option. Sell him now and gamble on getting in a world class replacement that can hit the ground running. Thats a big risk. And when Sterling starts playing at a top level for a rival club we'll look pretty foolish. 

Or, we keep him here for as long as we can. If he develops like we hope he does, he could go for 100m in a few years.

&gt;Clegg and Danny Alexander have been falling over each other to collude in the Tory lie that “We’re all in this together” because of Labour spending. What spending would that be? Oh, spending on things such as the NHS and introducing waiting-time targets so that, I dunno, say, a 43-year-old woman with cancer doesn’t have to wait months for a mastectomy that comes too late to save her. That kind of spending.

&gt;In 1990, my mother was at the mercy of an NHS after a decade of underinvestment (which had several more years to go). Schools and hospitals had buckets under the ceiling to catch the rain. You do remember, don’t you? The patients on trolleys in corridors and the lessons in Portakabins, the closing libraries, the riots, the homeless people sleeping rough? The hysterical rows in the Tory party about Europe, the press denigrating the Labour leader, the insistence that the poor protect the wealthy? You remember, right?

&gt;

&gt;__Internal monologue__, also known as __inner voice__, __internal speech__, or __verbal [stream of consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_of_consciousness_(psychology\))__ is [thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking) in [words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word). It also refers to the semi-constant internal [monologue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monologue) one has with oneself at a conscious or semi-conscious level (see [Default mode network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network)).

&gt;Much of what people consciously report ""thinking about"" may be thought of as an internal monologue, a conversation with oneself. Some of this can be considered as speech rehearsal.

&gt;

&gt;


&gt;* When people read, their internal monologue actually moves their muscles slightly as if they were speaking; [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] this is called [subvocalizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subvocalizing).

&gt;


&gt;* In some medical or mental conditions there is uncertainty about the source of internal sentences. [Attribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_(psychology\)) for an internal monologue may lead to concerns over [schizophrenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia), [hallucinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucinations), or hearing voices.

&gt;


&gt;* [Contemplation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemplation) attempts to calm the internal voice by various means.

&gt;


&gt;* In the [philosophical field of language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_language) there is much research about internal speech in correlation with the building and usage of phrases in one's own idiom and thus the importance of [language in the process of thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_and_thought).

In what I've seen, usually those making a a point about the culture/religion tend to then use that as an argument against multiculturalism or immigration. 

The view on the other side is that even if Pakistani Muslim culture did contribute to these problems (personally, I believe what we are seeing is a case of a bad but significant minority making the rest look bad), short of completely shutting down our borders (and we're talking North Korea extremes of border control) and throwing out everyone with a Pakistani Muslim heritage, attacking the culture itself isn't a productive solution. What is a productive solution is to demonstrate that inclusive and respecting of their diversity, but that in return they need to obey and respect the laws and customs of the land they live in. Essentially, these problems aren't caused because we have multiculturalism - in fact, the existence of insular, ghetto like communities goes against the very principle of multiculturalism (which is to have many cultures mixing into a single community, being diverse whilst respecting each other and the laws of the land).

EDIT: I can't speak for everyone on the ""left"" side, but what I'm saying is that I believe we're about as concerned about Pakistani Muslim communities generally being insular, non-inclusive and non-respectful for our laws and customs as you are. The difference is we believe the solution is found not in treating them as a special case but by treating them the same as we would everyone else, in this case, we have already have laws banning the sexual abuse of minors that should have been applied and cultural background was a pretty shitty excuse for inaction by the police. Meanwhile we can deal with the 'epidemic' (I use quotations here purely because I don't think its quite the right word but I can't think of the right word to actually use) nature of the problem by trying to address why it is that Pakistani Muslims don't feel they are able to integrate with our society.",null,0,null,1430836641,null,0,1430837266,0,cqz3n1z,null,t3_34xfex,null,t1_cqz3n1z,null,t1_cqz2kx4,null,null,null,1432783711,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

We of course have some period housing but there was a housing boom in Brackla some decades ago and since 1998 to this very day we've been investing almost exclusively, massively into Broadlands for housing.

Why on earth they didn't lay proper cable infrastructure I don't know... and still aren't laying new internet cables! A lot of streets are still stuck on old copper wire while in Europe fibre optic is old news. Even then the exchanges are too far away or ISPs cannot deliver a stable connection.

It's absolutely baffling because when you go to rightmove.co.uk or most online agencies for houses, they factor broadband speed and availability into the listing now. Broadband is a selling point for houses... so builders REALLY need to catch up.

This is a beast that can be attacked from many angles.

1) Nationalise BT OpenReach to guarantee a basic Internet connection to all

2) Increase social housing so builders cannot monopolise the housing market, knowing people will take _any_ property due to shortages - this means they will have to start considering things like which quality of cables to lay etc

3) Admit the Superfast Cymru scheme has failed because even where good connections were laid, the prices to use the faster connections are too high. We need to ensure the infrastructure increases while costs stay down - exactly like our European friends.

As an addition to a strong physical network; mobile phone deadzones being eliminated would also improve our internet coverage when roaming and we should also have public wifi spots where needed.

I completely agree with you about our shops here. The shops shutting down in the town centre was something I was always aware of but after the collapse of gamestation, blockbuster and now even clothes shops (something you don't typically go online for) missing from our streets makes it looks barren! There are some classic fixes for this which will help in the short term; reducing fees stores pay to set up (lease/business rates) and having free parking in towns so people are encourages to stop and shop... but ultimately we also need people's wages to increase to a standard where they can afford to shop. It also used to be the case where only one parent in a household would work and provide the money while the other would shop during the day - now we live in a society where both parents or both partners need to work because wages have been ground down so low - so our economic policies would help people to have to work less and having some actual free time to shop.",null,0,null,1430837694,null,0,false,0,cqz47yn,null,t3_34x6xf,null,t1_cqz47yn,null,t1_cqz2whe,null,null,null,1432783996,null,2,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,2,null

null,false,Drowz0r,null,null,null,"I've got a reasonably good relationship with some ex and existing Green and Plaid members in South Wales that I've discussed this at length with. I've also spoken with renewable energy firms (we use solar panels on my house too, actually) so I understand the potential benefits and how unpredictable our current renewable energy can be.

Now firstly I'd have to tell you I am massively against fracking in Wales. Even if it was environmentally safe we don't need fracking sights blighting our landscape for energy we do not need.

Wales produces a surplus of energy. We export the surplus to England, as England runs on a deficit (nice of us, isn't it?)

So the tidal lagoon isn't needed for energy but is needed to get us off fossil fuels - let's be clear on its goals.

Essentially two things need to be done:

1) Increased Devolution to protect against fracking, powers to make money from our surplus energy and what energy producing methods to use in the future

2) We can afford to slowly switch to renewable and decommission fossil fuel stations because Wales is running at such a high surplus.

The Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon is heavily debated. Even the Greens themselves are split on that one - and they usually love anything that smells like renewable energy.

I do like the reliability of our tides and being able to harvest that is certainly appealing. Additionally a lot of 100% renewable energy towns, such as the one in Poland (Kisielice) always resort to using water in some way - so we should be looking outward to solutions.

The simplest answer I can give you is, if it makes affordable energy by comparison to other renewables and doesn't ruin the landscape (perhaps seascape is more accurate) then I am all for it.

If it ruins the sea - we still have a lot of other options in solar, wind, geothermal and hydro power from our rivers, if not the ""Swansea lagoon"".

In short, love the idea, love the potential - but let's base our plans in evidence.

Edit: P.S. Yes PPUK is growing in many measures - policy making, range of reach across the UK and while we had to find our footing and professionalise the party in the first few years - membership is now showing a positive trend :)

null,false,Sgt_General,null,null,null,"I've gone for something a bit different, since we've seldom had consistently good performances in this league playing 4-4-2:

                Schmeichel

    Byram    Bamba   Kisnorbo   Warnock

            Johnson     Delph

    Snodgrass     Howson      Gradel

                 Becchio

Substitutes: Kenny, Lees, C.Taylor, Cook, Mowatt, McCormack, Smith.

Close call between Schmeichel and Kenny, who I consider to be our best goalkeepers since relegation, but I had to go for the one who joined us with his career ascending. Both of them are great shot stoppers, but their relatively short stature was exploited at set pieces. I feel that Kenny had a better command of his area, but Schmeichel made less risky, eccentric actions. If Silvestri could actually catch the ball, he could potentially be better than both of them, but he came up short this season.

If we actually had a centre-back pairing like Bamba and Kisnorbo during our first season back in the Championship, then we probably would have been promoted. They would have made up for Schmeichel's lack of height with their own size and strength, and they fit together nicely with one left-footer and one right-footer. Both are adept at commanding the defence, too. Unfortunately we had Kisnorbo injured (and he didn't come back the same player) and Bamba was elsewhere.

Lees was a contender, but his performances have also been tended to be steady, as opposed to the outstanding displays by the two centre halves in this team. Byram and Warnock, of course, stand out as the two best full backs we've had post-relegation, the only challenger to Byram was Lichaj, while Taylor only falls short because he's been playing left wing more than left back this season. I'm looking forward to seeing him make that position his own next season!

When Grayson changed our formation to a 4-2-3-1, Johnson and Howson really came into their own. Johnson seemed much more comfortable in a midfield holding role alongside someone else (usually Kilkenny), and his strength and power make up for what the rest of the midfield lacks. Austin could also provide this, and in fact he's unlucky to not make the team, but it's telling that teams with Johnson in have always been in the running for a top six finish. This role also suits Delph, who just beats out Cook as a similar but more accomplished player in that position. Playing Howson in the hole also takes advantage of his best position, which is playing off a target man, being the link between midfield and attack, and chipping in with plenty of goals.

Snoddy and Gradel are obvious choices - they have no real competition for their positions because of our chronic lack of wingers since relegation. If this were a real team then our biggest weakness would be coping with either of these players getting suspended or injured, which would require a change in formation and potentially getting overrun in midfield as we have many times in the past with these players.

This is why Becchio is up front on his own: he was consistently superb in that role for us and his goals - along with those of the three behind him - in addition to his hold-up play made up for the lack of another striker and allowed us to strengthen the midfield. The best part about having the likes of McCormack and Smith - one of our most prolific Championship striker partnerships - on the bench is that we would then have the opportunity to switch things up in the second half, if the deadlock has yet to be broken or we're chasing the game. The only big absence is Beckford, but he hasn't really done much in the Championship and I don't feel like you can have two 'luxury' players in the same squad, so I went with McCormack, who has been prolific at this level.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt;How do you overcome the competing problems of highest poverty and reliance on government help is in areas with lowest tax receipts. I don't see a way this could work without the welfare budget being federal, and for that matter the healthcare budget. 
  
In the United States, wealthier states subsidise poorer ones.  In order to prevent unfairness, one presumes some more complex legal safeguards would have to be put in place (to ensure states don't lower taxes to 0 and live off the federal purse), but there is no reason why some fiscal transfer system could not be implemented.   In Germany, the richest states of Bavaria and Baden-Wurttenberg massively subsidise the poor North.  

&gt;How much misdirection are you willing to put up with for this? Will you tax people who own companies who own property? How much is Asda (owned by Walmart) going to have to pay?

In this case the tax would refer solely to residential property designated for private use, regardless of corporate ownership.  So if I register a company in the Caymans to own my house in London, I would still pay the tax.  If my company owned a car dealership, it would not have to pay tax on the dealership, though it would of course pay normal business rates, which are very high in the UK anyway.   Limiting tax to residential property is not particularly challenging.  The intention is to ensure that *someone* always pays.  Ie. for each property not owned by a permanent British resident (directly or indirectly), the tax would be paid.   If not, the property would of course be confiscated until the tax bill + interest was paid.  

&gt;I assume this is Brexit?

I'm not a massive fan of Brexit.  The logistics of free movement deals are complex, there's no explicit statement in the EU constitution that bans individual nations setting their own immigration requirements.   I am in favour of a general renegotiation, however.  I still support many EU programs, such as the ESA I mention above.

This is the case some of the time, but even if it is, it shouldn't bar all asylum seekers from entering the country. The fact is that the majority of migrants assimilate to local culture, and any cultural practices they continue are not harmful to our society, and in fact diversify and strengthen our (pretty weak and backwards) inherent cultural practices.

Your argument about encouraging migrants to take risks in getting here, I would argue that they only risk dangerous journeys when escaping war zones and famine stricken areas which are equally dangerous if not more so. What right do we have to turn them away when they face risks such as these upon their return? I would liken this problem to that of drug use; it's going to happen regardless. You can let it happen illegally, and let people die of overdose and diseases, or you can support drug addicts (without encouraging the practice) by helping them to do it safely.

I sincerely think that the solution to the problem is not following the route Australia has taken, and doing everything within our power to keep asylum seekers out, if for humanitarian reasons alone.

First of all, English football fans are not critical of globalization. They are critical of oligarchs from places like UAE, Russia, and Uzbekistan spending ill-gotten money on taking control over local communal institutions. For an American observer this might seem strange, as the majority of pro teams in the U.S. has moved from one state to another state at least once in their history. 

Secondly, when fans in England get behind the local player, it is not a stance against migration. It is  because they want the club to be rooted in the community (I think this is the appeal it has to foreign fans too).

I personally would say that if you have spare money available now you would be better off waiting, put the money into a stocks and shares ISA for the time being and wait.

Now lets say 5 or 10 or 20 years down the line you are now a higher rate tax payer and you have a bunch of money saved, you could make a pension contribution then of funds that you have saved and benefit from the 40% tax relief whilst only paying 20% tax at retirement (if you are a basic rate tax payer then).

As to question 2: say party A (the chargor) has a claim on party B. Party C (the chargee/bank) has a fixed charge on (among other assets) the claim A-B, as assurance for a debt owned by party A. Also, assume B knows of the fixed charge, and knows that party A is not authorized anymore to dispose of it.

What happens when A decides (for example because B is a good friend) to waive the claim he has on B, or when A decides to change certain conditions of the claim on B (e.g., the deadline by which B has to pay, or the interest B has to pay)? Do these developments have any influence on the ability of the administrator or administrative receiver to enforce the claim A had on B?

Even the 50p tax rate led to a [Fall](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/tax/9097219/50p-tax-rate-failing-to-boost-revenues.html) in government revenue. When you start taking half of someone's income they will start aggressively chasing ways to reduce it. 45p is progressive and fair. 

Even Labour's proposed abolishment of the non-dom status has been left open for interpretation. Why? Because rich people coming to the UK and spending money here is absolutely beneficial for the economy. 

Also, the Swedish Transaction tax pursued by the Swedish Trade Union Confederation, in spite of protests from the Finance Ministry led to 60% of the trading volume in the most actively traded Swedish stock classes moving to London. 

What does that mean? High taxes does not equal higher revenue. And as our world becomes increasingly globalised and corporations increasingly mobile Labour increasing corporate taxes, income taxes, the bank levy, stamp reserve duty on our pensions/investment portfolios, scrapping the non dom status, introducing a mansion tax, taxing bankers bonuses and scrapping tax incentives that has seen films like Avengers being made here will probably see a net loss for our HMRC.

null,false,gamas,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"&gt; Really, my only contribution to this debate is that we have to have the freedom to criticize bad ideas, even when they are part of people's culture or religion.

Which is more than what most people who usually bring up this debate contribute... I mean I personally question whether raping underage girls can really be considered a part of one's culture or religion, I believe the majority of Pakistani Muslims would condemn those who commit sexual abuse, and I do not believe these acts are a part of Pakistani/Muslim culture. In fact I'm pretty sure that the Koran has pretty strong views on premarital sex. 

Anyway, that's a slight digression. generally I tend to find that often whenever a 'discussion' about culture/religion comes up, usually the person doesn't have a point beyond trying to say that Muslim/Pakistani culture is bad. Like I have occasionally just said ""Ok, suppose Muslim/Pakistani culture is a cause of the problem, what do you propose we should do about it?"" and never get a response, just a continued narrative about how muslim/pakistani culture is bad.. 

One time, I literally just gave up arguing because they kept trying to make me prove that Muslim/Pakistani culture isn't bad, when I wasn't even trying to argue for/against Muslim/Pakistani culture at this point, just arguing that simply calling out the cultural persuasions of the people involved isn't useful unless it can be demonstrated how this knowledge can be used to solve the problem.

EDIT: I would say though that any discussion about culture/race/other issues involving specific groups of people needs to be taken with extreme care with some level of self-censorship, not because of political correctness, but because an uninformed, heated discussion on the subject can often lead down a dangerous path of sectarianism - we need to be able to have the discussion without it turning into an us vs them.",null,0,null,1430840361,null,0,1430841152,0,cqz5sso,null,t3_34xfex,null,t1_cqz5sso,null,t1_cqz4tfd,null,null,null,1432784739,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

FPTP is the way we vote for our constituencies. No matter what voting system we use, if we rely on constituencies the way we do now we will never get proportional representation.

AV may give you a more meaningful vote, but it's still one winner per constituencies, and thus one party could theoretically hold all the seats in parliament with 51% of the voters on their side.

So you really need to be looking at reforming the concept of constituencies. Constituencies are nice, they represent your area. They give you a person to talk to who specifically deals with issues you face. So we don't want to get rid of them, so how do we go about getting proportional representation? [One example is MMP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT0I-sdoSXU).

This doesn't change the way the government would work, but I thought it was important to point out the slight difference (that I know you already know because of a reply further down). Mostly because I'm fairly certain that while a lot of people would like proportional representation and ""blame"" FPTP they have no idea how a better voting system would work.

Not particularly, because Messi's game is based on dribbling rather than out right pace. 

Arjen Robben doesn't play as a striker because he's invaluable on the wing when he can beat players and chip in with goals. Lewandowski cannot play as a winger (or at least effectively), but a winger can play as a striker. The problem wingers have is not their skill set per se, but their ability to put the ball in the net (being a natural finisher). Wingers notoriously score less goals than strikers mainly because of that.  I suspect if we bought Robben he would play up front rather than on the wing.

Problems that are worse in winter review your diet, ensure particularly you are eating plenty of oily fish for the bioavailable vitamin D and long chain omega-3s - experts advocate up to four servings a week.

Salicylic acid is a good option if you have clogged pores but needs to be at the right pH and left on to be effective, not in a cleanser or scrub that is washed off. See the AHA/ BHA mega review in the sidebar for product ideas.

Another option is to consult your family doctor, some of the most effective products for acne vulgaris are prescription only.

Last year's sales from Saints haven't performed at the same level with their new squads. This combined with Bertrand, who wasn't wanted by Liverpool or Villa, perhaps overperformed with us. They must be wary of a large drop off in form. 

Clyne excels when there is space in front of him. But as teams are more afraid of us, they work to close that down. Intricate passing around the box is a weak point in his game, and that will come up more with the big teams.

The constitution would have a lower House elected by STV and a reformed upper House with no hereditary peers, no bishops and no former elected politicians. 

I'd have vacancies in the upper House filled by a super-majority vote in the lower House with the idea of having the upper House as divorced from party politics as possible (the idea would be that candidates for the upper House had to be acceptable to both the government and the opposition so that non-political experts were appointed rather than party functionaries).

It'd also have more powers devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with a corresponding EVEL arrangement for England.

I'd also throw in some constitutional prohibitions on lengthy detention-without-charge, secret trials and similar baby's-first-police-state crap that has been so popular with politicians recently. I'd also like to include a right to free speech in there (terribly American, I know, but still).

If my constitution was rejected, I'd draft a new one that more or less just put down the current state-of-affairs into concrete form but which made it clear who gets to form a government in the event of a hung parliament (probably as ""Largest party gets two weeks to pass a Queen's Speech. If they cannot, second party gets two weeks to try. If they fail as well, third party gets two weeks. If third largest party fails, hold a fresh general election."") and see if the public would approve that one.

Apart from running a constitutional referendum, I would leave things more or less as-is; I'd raise departmental budgets, tax thresholds, minimum wage and welfare benefits in line with inflation but no further. I'd make sure that our military spending was 2%, but would not raise it any higher.

Since the constitutional referendum would be creating uncertainty anyway, I'd also hold a referendum on the EU. Simple Yes/No ""Should the UK withdraw from the European Union?"". As an unelected dictator, I wouldn't consider it appropriate to campaign on one side or another on that question.

Hopefully, by the 2016 election, Britain will have a shiny new constitution (or failing that, at least rules to stop me being needed again) and the European question have been put to bed one way or another.

null,false,lgf92,null,null,null,"Yes; PO clerk here, and people often refer to ""Registered Delivery"" and ""Recorded Delivery"".

There are two kinds of 'trackable/semi-trackable' service that Royal Mail offer in standard post: Signed For and Special Delivery. This has been the case for at least a year since I've been working there.

Signed For is partially trackable (you get a barcode number that you can enter online to check whether the parcel has been received or not), offering confirmation of delivery, and is covered up to the value of £50. We recommend it for birthday cards with cash/vouchers worth less than £50 in them or for things such as train or concert tickets, and it's also useful if you want to know that documents or other things have arrived.

Special Delivery is a fully tracked, insured to £500 service which I would use to send almost anything of value. As a new passport is £72.50 it is always a good idea to send your passport via SD - in fact if you tell me your parcel has your valid, uncancelled passport in it I can sell you the postage and you can put it in the box outside, but I won't take it over the counter so that you can't claim that the PO is liable for it going missing. SD is also guaranteed by 1pm the next working day, and handled securely and separately from the regular post (it is locked in a drawer then transferred into a separate, secure, barcoded bag). 

As such you *can't* send a passport by Signed For (as the latter has to be accepted over the counter) and your choice is between putting a large letter stamp on it and chucking it in the box (95p) or paying the £6.45 to make sure it gets there.",null,0,null,1430842762,null,0,false,0,cqz7aox,null,t3_34xxsy,null,t1_cqz7aox,null,t1_cqz3jxx,null,null,null,1432785445,null,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5,null

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1Ae5rgUG9U

For those of you who can't watch that right now:

Crowd sourcing policies sounds something a bit risky and complicated but it's actually, probably, the simplest and easiest ways to build a manifesto. I've seen the classic Labour method, I've seen the Greens method... and now Pirates and it's just infinitely better.

However that is merely a by-product of why we do it. We do it because regardless of having a simple, modest, one-liner idea or an entire full blown report, you can submit your idea for a policy. I've done a few myself actually!

Once submitted, the policy is discussed, both encouraged and critically evaluated. Everyone gets a chance to submit evidence for or against the policy, if they want to.

Once the policy discussions are over, it's put to the policy team to write it up into a formal and neutral policy. By neutral I mean it doesn't sound left wing, right wing or the wording isn't trying to convince/discourage the reader.

The last step is for the membership to vote for or against the policy.

You can even make a suggestion to have an existing policy removed, if you think times have changed and something needs updating.

It's a true Pirate way of doing things - Pirates try before they buy. So you can be hugely involved without even being a fully fledged member. This way people can see we listen way before them having to officially join the party. 

We then find that naturally, when people are heard they join up.

We use our website forum and reddit primarily but many other sources are used too. Then naturally we advertise it through the usual social media outlets.

We recently finished a crowd source here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/policy2015

Another benefit is, you don't need nor should you have a few people trying to dream up all conceivable policies a party needs. You get a much more direct democratic process and it's a much more manageable workload for the policy team.

It makes a policy that isn't me or even us - it's a policy that is _you_.

rule 1 that cannot ever be revoked. Anyone who seeks to be a politician is instantly and permanently banned from ever being a politician. 

rule 2 Ministers will be appointed who are recognised experts in the field they will be managing. If you cant make a living doing it you probably shouldn't be in charge of it for the country. Those chosen must feel reluctant and the crushing weight of responsibility to not fuck up the nation. Anyone who is too keen doesn't understand the level of responsibility and is therefore barred.

rule 3 Politicians who have never had a job that wasn't in politics or the media are banned from office for life. 99% of the real world isn't media or politics, its no accident our politicians are out of touch.

rule 4 the house of lords will be kept, all existing members thrown out and local elections held much like for the parliament. the only people who can stand are people of good standing from the community who have a good track record in their chosen profession. the overall mix in the house must reflect a wide range of careers and paths in actual real life. Their job is not to decide any policy but to sanity check anything emanating from parliament.

rule 5 Science mother fuckers, all drug laws, braking distances, nhs health policies etc will be decided upon evidence based science, homeopathy can fuck right off, drug laws that incrase the issue can fuck right off.

rule 6 laws, this shit needs fixed and is a whole load of typing i cant be arsed with but i think most people know what are ridiculous sentences and which arent. life also now means life...its not rocket science

rule 7 tax. how fucking hard can it be to close loop holes. if you earn money you pay tax, the more you earn the higher the percentage. companies can no longer send profits offshore. Starbucks if you sell a billion cups of coffee you fuckers WILL be paying a fuck ton of tax. Instead of loopholes for companies and to encourage business the corporate tax rate will be 9%, but thats 9% of paid up or fuck off and we nationalise your business.

rule 9 free zones and investment. If you wish to set up business in the UK you get the worlds best tax rate but only if you keep it all here and pay fairly. Train local employees, you get an incentive, buy/source supplies locally, incentive. behave like a responsible non sociopathic entity and an active member of the community, get an incentive. Established businesses who wish to join in can do so, keep behaving like cunts and i will nationalise everything you own.

I thought that the chargee would get that propietary interest in each of the charged receivables (claims against third parties) (?)

I understand that A would be in breach of agreements, but for which damages would he be liable? Does C suffer any damages? Because, if C would - as preferential creditor - still be entitled to the proceeds of the claim, he wouldn't suffer damages, right?
