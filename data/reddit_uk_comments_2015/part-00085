That said, I think you're right we disagree with regards the joke thing. It boils down to a matter of pragmatics and evidence. It's also linked to your floodgates point earlier. 

If you allow jokes to be a valid legal defence you're opening a door for defendants to go around claiming what they did was a joke, regardless of the results it caused. Law is results focused, it's a system, and so it will strive to nip those kinds of arguments in the bud. It isn't perfect, nor does it aim to micromanage and get people to follow every letter of it, but it will come into play when things go sour -- that's the whole point, like a form of damage control and mediation. 

Less politicised examples outside of free speech are usually more straightforward when illustrating this. If was having a bit of laugh, say by rolling a tractor tire down a hill, but that tire wound up striking and damaging a vehicle, it wouldn't do me much good to say, ""I'm sorry officer, I really didn't mean it. I was honestly just joking."" People are expected to exercise their own judgement before they say or do things. Nevertheless, sometimes people exhibit poor enough judgement that it results in matters being arbitrated by the law.  

This is not to say it ignores context though. On the contrary, context, and especially with regards to speech, is key. It's the equivalent to free speech what possession is to ownership (the saying that possession is 9/10's of the law). Context also comes in to distinguish harassment, which as you rightly point out is a matter of repetition (generally), and threats which need only happen once. 

Let's look at your example for instance:

&gt; guys in the workplace bringing up an old joke frequently as part of a comradely is very different from a neighbour repeatedly calling you names and relying on the ""joke"" defence.

I understand what you mean with the example but just want to point out how results/conclusions of legitimacy may change with a few minor alterations. Say for instance the guys who thought they were being friendly and so on didn't realise the effect they had on their 'target,' in this case a woman. Things would turn on what was being said, how often, where (workplace to be distinguished from home etc) and their effect on her. We'd need to look at the matter in the round and take account the strength and credibility of evidence going towards each of the points. So it's not really just a matter of something just happening or someone countering that it was just a 'joke.' It would all have to be shown or proven without losing sight of the wider context of the situation itself, and the area of law as whole. 

I haven't read the Twitter case(s) recently but if I remember correctly it wasn't friends pressing charges or who had called the police. It isn't exactly turning regular activities criminal; the aim is to translate what has always been criminal into the digital realm, which mixes elements of privacy (joke between friends) and publicity (jokes across a network). This is part of what is tricky about the internet.

null,false,TheAnimus,null,null,null,"a) doubt it.  I would guess it's far more likely it's born out of vote rigging and political ambition, for many, the europe project is something sacred, that we must do, even if us more developed places provide a brain drain on say Lithuania.  That is before we get onto the simple fact that we've got a generation, who have taken more than they've given, as such above replacement rate is essential to keeping the system function.  See pension deficit, NHS spending, even discounted, rises as we offer more, often to people who are retired.  The grim reality is, someone has to pay for that.

b) one form of this, absolutely yes, I would suggest it's been a way of providing stimulus, by means of debt load on the newer generations.  If I bought a flat tomorrow, that someone bought for £80k 15 years ago, it would cost me say £400k.  That is private consumer debt, but the difference is often released into the economy.  However that borrowing has to come from somewhere, so the effect isn't as significant as you might think.  There is another odd one, that is simply consumer confidence.  Someone asked me a few weeks back, why I didn't live in a part of London.  That part was rather shit when I first moved here, but has come along leaps and bounds, it's simply because confidence resulted in everyone investing there.  Having price rises provides that confidence, and actively punishes those who wait.  The last part is the important bit, at least, that's what people say when talking about inflation/deflation in simple micro terms.

There is a goal of any government, increase the economy, without inflation.  When much of your basket comes from efficient, cheap labour practices, often in other currencies, service inflation can run rampant.  The only way to have an improvement for all is either wealth transfer (which often doesn't do as much as people think, if the supply of the goods which there is now more demand for doesn't stretch) or efficiency improvement, that is, making say a phone with only 10 hours of labour, rather 100.  This then allows that other 90 hours of labour to be spent on other shit we don't need, but somehow provides fleeting happiness.

However, I get tired with many people (especially those who know nothing about finance or economics) blaming this situation on 'the banks'.  The reason we had any problems in the UK the last 10 years, is due to our trading partners consumption declining, which when looking at the stats hasn't been *that* much, but mostly because we were living on credit in an unsustainable manner.  As individuals, we used consumer credit to fund a lifestyle in excess of what we could afford, the credit provided no increased value, as a government used debt to pay for things today, that we couldn't afford.  This is the problem, the corruption in the banking system, the unfit for purpose credit ratings agencies, these are minor in comparison.  Debt can be a useful tool, but only if the benefit is going to be higher than the cost of it, sadly, adding two or three years to a cancer victims life does not provide that return.

But like anything you can't just turn off that tap, you've got to gently taper it down, this is one of the issues Greece faces, as personally I can't conceive how they would get enough money if they did default and withdraw, to begin to fund the society in the manner they are accustomed, with the tax receipts they have.

These are not nice things, but it is the nature of human productivity viewed on mass.  It's also why greens policies strike me as dangerous, because idealism triumphs pragmatic views on reality and acknowledgement of history.

The cost/benefit ratio is massively in favour of keeping it uncapped.

The biggest reason dumbarses have too many kids... is because they're dumbarses.

You can't expect dumbarses to make smart decisions.

So by capping the welfare, you help ensure that those children will grow up to be poor... and likely dumbarses themselves.

It's a cruel fact that many people who live in poverty or near it, are not too smart. I don't mean UNINTELLIGENT, I mean lacking wisdom and education.

It's not ""fair"" that you should have to pay for these people's mistakes, but, like them, you live in an imperfect unfair world. That's not to JUSTIFY spending your tax dollars, but to remind you that in this unjust unfair world, some people are born into situations where their opportunity for growth and self-betterment is extremely limited. 

And don't forget others are also paying for you. 

With tax, what goes around, comes around.

The best way to make society more more efficient and productive (therefore requiring less tax) is to make people happier and more personally autonomous. 

We should be pouring vast amounts of money and effort into helping poor people NOW, because it ain't gonna get any cheaper any time soon.

From a *fiscally conservative* point of view, it's actually BETTER to have a generous welfare state than to not. That is not just MY conjecture, it's the conjecture of a large symposium of scientists, economists and other intellectuals who, as part of an [IMF thinktank](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2014/sdn1402.pdf), concluded inequality has a significant negative impact on economic growth.

null,false,apple_kicks,null,null,null,"&gt;The painting shows a scene from August 1765, when the young Mughal emperor Shah Alam, exiled from Delhi and defeated by East India Company troops, was forced into what we would now call an act of involuntary privatisation. The scroll is an order to dismiss his own Mughal revenue officials in Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, and replace them with a set of English traders appointed by Robert Clive – the new governor of Bengal – and the directors of the EIC, who the document describes as “the high and mighty, the noblest of exalted nobles, the chief of illustrious warriors, our faithful servants and sincere well-wishers, worthy of our royal favours, the English Company”. The collecting of Mughal taxes was henceforth subcontracted to a powerful multinational corporation – whose revenue-collecting operations were protected by its own private army.

 East India Trading Company ahead of its time.

Colonial Corporatism I thought likely isn't as powerful nowadays, but you sometimes hear stories about big companies bribing local officials for land or silencing opposition to sell off etc in poorer countries. 


Edit: great article been dipping into it bit by bit all day. I know it's still why he's writing the history but still seem like no lessons are ever learnt.

&gt;Yet, like more recent mega-corporations, the EIC proved at once hugely powerful and oddly vulnerable to economic uncertainty. Only seven years after the granting of the Diwani, when the company’s share price had doubled overnight after it acquired the wealth of the treasury of Bengal, the East India bubble burst after plunder and famine in Bengal led to massive shortfalls in expected land revenues. The EIC was left with debts of £1.5m and a bill of £1m unpaid tax owed to the Crown. When knowledge of this became public, 30 banks collapsed like dominoes across Europe, bringing trade to a standstill.

&gt;In a scene that seems horribly familiar to us today, this hyper-aggressive corporation had to come clean and ask for a massive government bailout...

&gt;But unlike Lehman Brothers, the East India Company really was too big to fail. So it was that in 1773, the world’s first aggressive multinational corporation was saved by history’s first mega-bailout – the first example of a nation state extracting, as its price for saving a failing corporation, the right to regulate and severely rein it in.

Yet a bus to enniskillen might get a double decker with about 10 people on it at the same time.

They do not resource according to demand. There is a service bus 38 belfast to lisburn to hillsborough to banbridge it takes 1 hour from belfast to hillsborough. It takes the most esoteric route ever.

The metro services in belfast are kind of silly when its late 2 of the same bus come at the same time 9 a/b/c comes to mind on the lisburn road. I used to hate waiting on that bus most of the time it was so late it was pointless.

At peak times in belfast the metro service gets stuck in traffic and the metro service is under the hand of the belfast city council and regional development to actually do something about our roads.

There is another bus that goes from hillsborough/culcavey to lisburn every half hour. I have never seen anyone on that bus bar maybe 2 people the odd time at christmas.

They try to run lots of routes to make up for it being a poor service but so many routes make nearly no business sense. They need to scale down and start investing their money into the wages of bus drives and their over time. They should really be forced to hand over money from their reserves to pay for road maintaince and also help towards better roads. Since probably that money is entirely from public funding i reckon they use customer money to cover salaries of drivers and fuel and use the public funds for everything else.

Our roads in Antrim and Down are kind of pathetic and nothing ever gets done about it. And its not able sustain any kind of constant flow of traffic.

Translink's problem is too many managers and people sapping pay fro m the actual workers. And not costing the routes they run properly. But this is also a side effect of buying an entire years fuel for a year.

They simply piss money up the wall and dont invest into its own future expecting stormont to handle that bill. Its just another side effect of the attitudes of the NICS in a different form.

Why do we *have* to make examples? The numbers make it clear that this is a *tiny* percentage of parents. And the money involved is a *tiny* proportion of public finances.

There are a vast number of undesirable behaviours that strain the public finances far more. People who eat too much or exercise too little, for example. Hey, if we're going to introduce measures to punish people for their behaviours, maybe we should increase NI payments for people who are obese... Except of course that would go over like a lead balloon with voters, because we'd be picking on a substantial number of people, not on a microscopic proportion of families.

This policy proposal has *nothing* to do with setting an example or cutting cost, and everything to do with milking moral outrage in advance of an election victimising a tiny number of people. If they wanted to set examples and cut costs, they'd focus their time an energy elsewhere.

&gt; If there was a cap are you saying that the people wouldn't then go out and get jobs? Wouldn't do something more for their kids?

How would they go out and get jobs? Do you realise what full time child care costs in this country? With four children that needs full time child care, many places you would need to earn a substantially above average salary before your salary would even cover child care, much less food and housing and other essential costs. 

&gt; In that case shouldn't social services be brought in if the mother cannot provide for their kids because she REFUSES to get a job.

And do what? Take the children into care? Do you realise what that costs, and the effect it has on the children? You would punish the children *and* the parent, and substantially increase the costs to the tax payer. What exactly is gained? Other than satisfying some moral outrage.

null,false,BFoskett,eng-somerset,Somerset,null,"Not in and of itself no, but cutting net government spending at at time of reduced consumption and private investment is only going to exacerbate the problems caused by low aggregate demand and put a serious dampener on economic growth. This is particularly true in the method of spending cuts that the government have made, which have fallen significantly on the fiscal stabilisers that would usually work to balance the economy over a business cycle. 

There is an ideological discussion to be had over the total size of the public sector in relation to the economy but such structural changes should not be wrought in a recession. Unfortunately it is much easier politically to implement structural change when things are already going badly but it is also very damaging due to the inherent instability caused by a recession (slight digression). 

Furthermore it is a missed opportunity to not take advantage of historically low government borrowing rates to increase investment. If there is ever a time for the government to spend proportionately extra money on health, education and capital projects it is during a time of depressed wages, low borrowing costs and low utilisation, if there is a time to reduce such things it is during periods of near full employment and over utilisation. 

If the conservatives want to reduce the state role in service provision (which economically speaking would be neither good nor bad) then that should be done at a time where there is excess investment money and reduced opportunities for investment.

Sorry I am quite tired and I'm not sure I am making the point very well so as way of an example:

Lets say that in a hypothetical country the only public industry is public road building, in times of recession the roads are being used less, construction firms are desperate for business and raw materials prices have fallen from weak demand. There are many unemployed people available for unskilled labouring. Investment is shying away from risky business investment and moving towards safer government bonds. 

This is the perfect time for a government to increase spending, they can start an ambitions renovation and expansion project and it will cost a great deal less, take less time, and be less disruptive to the people using the roads. The newly upgraded network will be ready and waiting for the next economic boom.

During said boom the roads are full, construction firms are working around the clock on private building projects, and there is a lot of competition for commodities stock, there are few unemployed people willing to do unskilled labour and therefore the government may need to pay overtime to any workers it hires, most private finance is tied up in higher return private projects and there is little appetite for low yielding government bonds. 

Any work the government begins during the boom will therefore achieve a lot less for the same input, and therefore the government should only put in the bare minimum it needs to in order to prevent the network from decaying. However if the roads are full and the government would like to increase their capacity in this relatively expensive boom period, it might make sense to legalise privately owned toll roads so that a private business that is willing to take bigger risks than the government and offer investors a better reward can fulfil the need for more road space instead. This would reduce the relative size of the state and 'cut red tape' and allow the private sector to keep growing.",null,0,null,1425560903,null,0,false,0,cp53u43,null,t3_2xw2jc,null,t1_cp53u43,null,t1_cp4ii2f,null,null,null,1427591858,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

[World population to 2300](http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf) (PDF).

""In these projections, world population peaks at
9.22 billion in 2075. Population therefore grows
slightly beyond the level of 8.92 billion projected
for 2050 in the 2002 Revision, on which these projections
are based. However, after reaching its
maximum, world population declines slightly and
then resumes increasing, slowly, to reach a level
of 8.97 billion by 2300, not much different from
the projected 2050 figure. ""

Later:

""Under the assumptions made in the medium
scenario projection, world population will not
vary greatly after reaching 8.92 billion in 2050
(figure 6). In another 25 years, by 2075, it is projected
to peak at 9.22 billion, only 3.4 per cent
above the 2050 estimate. It will then dip slightly
to 8.43 billion by 2175 and rise gradually to 8.97
billion, very close to the initial 2050 figure, by
2300. Therefore, world population growth beyond
2050, at least for the following 250 years, is expected
to be minimal. ""

In any case, the point is growth is flattening out. Furthermore, the growth is very uneven, and Europe for example will start seeing decline much earlier:

""Europe and Africa will be particularly out of
phase. Europe will hit its low point in growth in
2050, Africa not till 80 years later, after all other
major areas. From 2000 to 2100, Europe’s share
of world population is cut in half, 12.0 to 5.9 per
cent, while Africa's almost doubles, from 13.1 to
24.9 per cent. While shares of world population
for major areas will rise and fall over the following
two centuries, the distribution by 2300 will
resemble that in 2100. ""

A lot of the problems can't be fixed, imo the hotels are largely not of a quality i would want to stay in (this may not be true but i'm giving my perception), for food you've got a lot of Cafe's/Restaurants that don't necessarily cater to anything beyond budget and loads of shops selling souvenirs/tat. When I go on holiday I kinda want to feel a bit special and have a premium experience, I feel that Blackpool (on the whole) fails to provide this. I'm sure that all the business owners would love to refurbish and spruce up their businesses but the money just isn't there.

No one in their right mind would go to Blackpool unless they were on a severly limited budget (seeing as you can go to Spain but pennies these days and you might actually get to see some sun).

The best hope for Blackpool (in my opinion) would be to target it as a Vegas for England (I know it already has this title by some accounts but it is nowhere near as glamourous or exciting as the real Vegas). I'm thinking shiny new hotels, bars, clubs. restaurants  etc. basically a place a rich person could go to blow a lot of money. The only problem with this plan is that no one is going to invest in Blackpool because it doesn't look promising at all, a rich person isn't going to go for a weekend in Blackpool when he could just as easily go to another country (which in itself is quite an exciting thing to do).

Grounds are lovely - it is set in an old country estate. The venue is nice, though there are stairs for the reception room - something to consider for disabled relatives (though there is a lift if I recall). The food was quite nice too.
Bridal suite was gorgeous.

The Old Schoolhouse near Comber is quite fancy, though they never got back to us with a price - we figured we weren't their type of clientele and left it off the list.

The Old Inn Crawfordsburn is quite nice, seems popular for weddings, is situated near the Crawfordsburn park for photos. They had a wedding show around this time last year, though from their site it looks like its in June.

The Millbrook Lodge was recently refurbished in Ballynahinch, a bit further south but still Co Down, has nice grounds etc.

In terms of suppliers, your wedding venue can usually recommend people. We got a few of ours from word of mouth (cake, dress alterations, invitations etc.), the hotel recommended the DJ, the cars came from what looked like a reputable company at the wedding fairs (ie. not some cash in hand guy with an old Rolls) etc.

I think it's totally different as well, when someone finds themselves in a bad situation. Say if a relationship breaks down and a man moves out - these things happen. I would never begrudge a penny to anyone who needs it, and I think we should give more money to those in need.

But my sister chose what she did knowing this would be the result. She works somewhere where a lot of the single mothers have part time, 16 hour a week jobs, because a lot of employers support it. They get their tax credits, fill a gap in their CVs and set a great example to their kids, and I have nothing but respect for them. I would rather see taxes be redistributed like that than someone like my sister get away with doing literally nothing of worth or note with her time.

 She would actually be better off doing that, but it is easier for her to not. She;s got my mum convinced that it would be ""hard"" and too much hassle, but last time I checked, life is hard. Having kids is hard. It is not easy. But when you sweat and work and get it yourself, it is so much more worthwhile.

She finds men who will pay for her lifestyle and give her money, or claim child tax credits and have them paid into her bank account. When that dries up, she cheats to find another man (she'll happily fuck another bloke before dumping the old one) and move them in instead. She is literally a whore, but without the moral standards.

I have no idea what went wrong with her, but it scares me that she is allowed to raise children. You can tell from her interactions with her partners that she simply does not love them.

My Husband annoys me, don't get me wrong. But the bottom of it is, I love him with all of mt heart, and even when we're squabbling, I can't think of anyone else I would rather do this.

Come high water or hell, he's the man I want to get old and cranky with (as if I'm not already, ha!) and everything I want in life -a degree, to buy a house, travel, all that stuff - I want to do with him. I love that he encourages that, and I cannot imagine how miserable it must be to have so little love for yourself, that the best you think you can do is fuck some man you barely know so he will give you money.

I don't know where my Mum went wrong, but I know my sister was very spoiled and fussed over as a kid. She's got some degree of musical talent and was treated like that was enough to get her through life, so maybe the ""you're a special snowflake who doesn't need to work"" mentality plays a role?

For me though, seeing my single working mother struggle was enough incentive to want to better myself. I guess individual perception of things plays a role too?

Its that tacky stigma that to me destroys the place.

But during the match yesterday Aguero seemed exceptionally pissy which is unusual..  It all started out when aguero was making a run on the backline with silva waiting to pounce.. But silva waited too long.. So aguero was offsides... So then aguero pulled himself back onsides to make another run.  At this point silva passed aguero through but aguero was going backwards to get back onsides so it was a mess of bad timing.  

Aguero then ran for the ball but it went out.   He then turned and started yelling at silva and silva started yelling back.. Both arguing their side..  They kept yelling at each other out of frustration for about 60 seconds..  

Then later in the game, aguero was making a lot of runs and wasn't getting passed to and was just generally upset at the flow of the game.  Basically he wants to score really really bad and the way the team isn't clicking wasn't helping... 

So aguero is making one of his runs and he's open and he doesn't get the pass, instead it goes out to the left wing... Aguero just stops running now because he's offsides again, I can't really remember but the passing continues and aguero and is just standing there about 30 yards out angry.. Meanwhile kolorav Bony and silva work some nice passing and score a goal.. 

Aguero just stands there I think kinda surprised that our team scored without him, because well, it's usually all on him..   So then I think aguero casually went over and congratulated silva.  

But then at halftime aguero and silva made up high fivin and whatnot.

BUT THEN when they came back out and were waiting for the second kickoff aguero and silva were argueing about that moment again which was kind of hilarious.  

Anyways, my point was that silva and aguero get along well enough that they can yell at each other and it's not a big deal because they will never hate each other.

It's no coincidence that Skrtel's best season at the club (purely defensively) came with Steve Clarke as the assistant manager, where he set up a deep and compact defensive unit - something he'd later replicate as manager at West Brom, and the very opposite of how Rodgers wants the team to defend.

I can't see this happening even if it were to go through. They might stop charging but it doesn't stop them from not providing an equivalent service to roaming operators- and it may still mean that network operators won't deal with you if you can't prove residence in that country. Roaming agreements are still commercially sensitive and negotiated between operators, and you can bet that all network operators in all countries would be doing what they can to prevent ""permanent roaming""

e.g. with 3 you get free roaming in a few countries, but people often report that data performance isn't really very good, it's okay for basic usage and checking emails but nothing like what you'd get if you signed up to a local network directly. There's also a FUP and a limit on how long you can use it (fairly generous, I think you get a few months per year of roaming before they have words)

&gt; **Your right to cancel**  Your right to cancel an order for goods starts the moment you place your order and ends 14 days from the day you receive your goods. 

&gt; **Your right to a refund**  A deduction can be made if the value of the goods has been reduced as a result of you handling the goods more than was necessary.

&gt; The extent to which a customer can handle the goods is the same as it would be if you were assessing them in a shop.

&gt; **Exemptions** There are some circumstances where the Consumer Contracts Regulations won’t give you a right to cancel.

&gt; These include, CDs, DVDs or software if you've broken the seal on the wrapping, perishable items, tailor-made or personalised items. 

&gt; Also included are are goods that have been mixed inseparably with other items after delivery.

It feels as though the CCRegs probably should allow you to cancel within fourteen days of receiving the goods, though equally it feels as though the retailer would be entitled to deduct a fair chunk from the value as they can no longer sell the goods as anything like new.

null,false,seamushoo4,lfc68,,null,"yeah op i would say this should have been considered a success since mid feb, if not earlier. Breaking it down, i would say can has been our best performing signing, closely followed by moreno (who doesn't get as much love, but has been one of the top left sided backs in the league since the turn of the year), followed by lallana because he's playing bloody brilliant now that he's healthy, followed by markovich who has come into his own (i would love him to get more minutes in attack b/c i think the boy has goals in him, but he's getting settled and BR is blooding him slowly), followed by lovren (who is gaining confidence again), followed by lambert, balotelli and manq collectively who have all played well for some periods of the season and done the job that's been asked of them. I think balotelli has gottent he most stick out of anyone, even more than lovren who i thought should have been receiving more abuse for his performances early on, but at the end of the day everyone was settling in and it takes time. balotelli is a world class talent, but im not sure what it will take to get the best out of him.. but all in all i mean i really can't say that we made a **bad** signing per se...i can say that i think balotelli wasn't the right guy for the system, but he has been pretty good recently and was at least creating chances when he wasn't scoring. 

anyways my response is long winded, but i think we did well over the summer transfer window and I think this summer we would do well by getting in between 3-5 players. a back up gk, a back up lb, a starting rb/rwb (johnson is leaving and i think athletico are gonna call manq back, which is part of the reason why i think we've been reluctant to play him. there must be some clause in his contract that if he plays a certain amount then athletico are going to recall him), a cm because with stevie leaving and lucas possibly still leaving this summer, i think we would do well by picking up a milner and a pjanic mould of player, maybe even carvahlho (seen rumors today on him) and finally i think we should get rid of borini and 1 of lambo or balotelli and pick up another striker. 

we will be getting wisdom, ilori, ojo and teixiera back from loan this summer and have a crop of other youngsters who might crack the code or get loaned out. 

i think we will honestly see leaving this summer, and some are obviously confirmed (stevie): 
1. stevie - 150k/week in wages
2. glenjo - 100k/week in wages
3. enrique - 2-3m in Transfer fees + 75k/week in wages
4. lucas - 5-8m in TF + 75k/week in wages
5. aspas - 4-7m in TF + 50k/week in wages
6. alberto -5-10m in TF + 30k/week in wages
7. yesil - 500k in TF + 5k/week in wages
8. coates - 1-2m in TF + 10k/week in wages
9. borini - 10m in TF + 50k/week in wages
10. manq (getting recalled, in fact im almost positive this will happen) - 30k/week in wages
11. (possibly not resigned, although i would prefer we did resign him and loan one of ilori or wisdom out one more time) toure - 50k/week in wages
12. brad smith - 5k/week in wages
13. dunn -5k/week in wages
14. one of balotelli/lambert - if balotelli, 12-16m in TF + 75k/week in wages, if lambert, 2-3 in TF + 50k/week in wages.
15. brad jones - 25k/week in wages. 


a possible sum of money collected from these guys: would be close to half a million per week in wages + 30m in transfer fees? i would say a mass exodus would be really good for the club and getting rid of youth players who don't think will make it now will give the other youth players a better platform to try and make it on. there are 42 players on the liverpool first team roster page, including a lot of the youth players, so if we got rid of 15 players, there would be 27 in our squad, and that includes youth players.

Any *individual* who earns between £50 - 60k must now complete a Self-Assessment and pay back a portion of the child benefit received. Any *individual* earning over £60k would have to pay it all back, so they might as well stop claiming it. It's not automatically deducted though - you must complete a self-assessment return.

This does not take into account families with two earners - if a husband and wife both earned £50k then they would still receive the benefit in full. Apparently it's too difficult to means test for household income despite the fact that is already done for any number of other benefits...

It's a compromise system between the members. 

Before the election each group elects a Spitzenkandidaten it's much like how parties in the us or France nominate a candidate for the president. After this is when the debate happened.

We vote in the eu elections for our mep's they go to Brussels and take their seats.  Which ever grouping gets the most seats has their candidate try and form a commission this has required a coalition every time because getting a majority under pr is verry difficult. 

At this point they must be formally nominated by the member states on the council,  this allows them to veto someone who they find objectionable but that has never been used. This is much like how the queen invites a party leader to become the prime minister and form a goverment. 
The council which is made up of the heads of goverment is sort a collective head of state with the president of the council being a spokesmen they alone get to choose who chairs the meeting and does the administration work (imo he should really be called chairman or foreman)

When the candidate has secured formal nomination and picked their team which must include a commissioner from every member state they have to win a vote of confidence in parliament,  this is a check we don't have in the UK as such but various members find it important that minsters be agreed by parliament. This does have the effect of strongly discouraging reshuffles for better or worse. 
Our closest parallel is passing a budget.

null,false,Horatio_Stubblecunt,null,null,null,"&gt;Planes are a bit different, if a quadro has a power failure, it falls like a brick.  Planes generally glide, I've not messed around with models, but on the real thing they normally keep themselves in trim for some form of glide (rather than aerodynamic stall).

I dunno, RC planes can stall pretty easily - say if the CoG gets nudged and it plummets (the latter just happened to me the other week, almost lost a nice frame). Then there's the whole issue of malfunctioning radio - say your control surfaces are locked and your throttle is jammed to 100%. I wouldn't t fancy being in front of my 54"" 2kg wing if that happened haha! 

Plus, even in a glide, it's gotta come down somewhere - right? I lost radio contact with a plane once and it glided over 2km with no control (luckily for me it landed in a nice empty field on the moors - but it's easy to imagine a nightmare scenario if I'd been flying closer to civilisation)


&gt;The other thing is few people use planes next to monuments and the like for filming.

True, however my local ""old school"" RC club is set up pretty close to a motorway and a very busy park. Nobody seems to worry about that other than me!

&gt;The 'quadro craze' is such that on a whim I bought a Bebop when stuck in honkers airport (it was £100 less than in the UK), the thing took me about 30 seconds to learn to operate, mostly, learning to operate the acceleramoitor in my tablet.  This isn't a bad thing, but we should really provide more advice on the safety aspect of it.


&gt;I've personally been effected by someone flying a drone along side the active runway at a licensed aerodrome.  It was funny to me to see a 70+ year old man escort someone half his age away.  I've heard some people suggest GPS black-listing could work, creating enforced no fly zones, my fear is with this it removes thought even more, and the kind of cunts I don't want to be up there with, will de-activate that firmware because *they know better*.

Damn thats awful! The most noob-friendly manufacturer (DJI) have actually done precisely that though, added no-fly zones 5km around airports and possibly smaller aerodromes - i think it's a fantastic idea, although I really cannot see how these people rationalise flying anything around full-sized craft as a smart thing to do!

&gt;I think some different classes could help, devices below &lt;500g, then below say 2.5kg, they could be treated differently.

IIRC that is in effect in a roundabout way, although the weight ""classes"" are something like &lt;4kg and up to 20kg? It's definitely in the ANO anyhow.

&gt;It's funny, I've not used my drone in the UK except in a empty part of Hampstead Heath, can't really think of anything to do with it.  And a friend of mine is building his own too.  I can appreciate how fun they are, I just wish people were more responsible with them, a small minority can ruin it for everyone.

Too right! If I may, I'd suggest taking it to a bit of semi-open woodland somewhere and try out some tree-dodging, maybe even racing. It's fairly exhilarating! 

It's pretty frustrating as someone who genuinely loves model aviation (rather than just getting a 30 quid drone and calling themselves an ""aerial photographer"" on Facebook), I've built quads for several friends and given them ""the talk"" about where they can and can't fly, best safety practices, insurance etc etc. If I'm not having to contend with arseholes flying recklessly over theme parks, then I'm catching flak from arseholes implying that I'm probably spying on them; as if a 1) a GoPro wasn't incredibly shit at anything other than wide-angle, or 2) anything they might be doing in their stupid garden could be anywhere near as interesting as a panoramic sweep of our beautiful landscape.

I’m not voting out of absolute indifference and weariness and exhaustion from the lies, treachery, deceit of the political class that has been going on for generations now and which has now reached fever pitch where you have a disenfranchised, disillusioned, despondent underclass that are not being represented by that political system, so voting for it is tacit complicity with that system and that’s not something I’m offering up.

&gt; **Jeremy Paxman:** Well, why don’t you change it then?

&gt; **Russell Brand:** Well, I’m trying to.

&gt; **Jeremy Paxman:** Well, why don’t you start by voting?

&gt; **Russell Brand:** (laughs) I don’t think it works. People have voted already and that’s what’s created the current paradigm.

_________

I actually will be voting in the general election so I don't entirely agree with the viewpoint espoused by Brand in the above quote (neither do I agree that people should be discouraged from voting), but it is a viewpoint I am quite sympathetic to. You say that the whole point of democracy is that everyone is heard and counted for but the viewpoint articulated by Brand is that this idea (and ideal) of democracy does not exist.

If this is not a viewpoint you agree with then fair enough, but pointing to the ideals of democracy (that change can be brought about by exercising our right to vote) does nothing to counter the belief that our democratic system has completely failed.

You've got that the wrong way around it was James Craig who pulled out of the Boundary Commission
 
&gt; Article 12 of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, signed by representatives of the British government and the de jure Irish Republic in December 1921, enabled Northern Ireland to opt out of the Irish Free State and set up a Boundary Commission to determine the final position of the border in the absence of a negotiated settlement.Having narrowly secured the support of Dáil for the Treaty, ushering in a brutal civil war in the South, Michael Collins entered into discussions with James Craig on the border and the possibilities for cross-border cooperation. In the event, two main factors proved the undoing of the Collins-Craig Pact: the existence of an unbridgeable gap between the two parties’ territorial expectations (Rankin, 2005: 19); and the continuation – indeed escalation – of violence in the North. The IRA’s sporadic and disorganised Ulster campaign of 1920-1922, which enjoyed Collins’ ambiguous support, was met with repression by the Unionist state. Catholic civilians bore the brunt of the reprisals meted out by the B Specials, a paramilitary security force drawn exclusively from remnants of the UVF (Farrell, 1983). At the same time, in an environment shaped by recession and the inflammatory behaviour of the Unionist elite, sectarian conflict erupted in Belfast, beginning in July 1920 with the mass expulsion of Catholics and ‘rotten Prods’ from the shipyards. Over the next two years, the city would see 453 deaths, 7,500 expulsions and 5,000 evictions from h omes, with the majority of victims Catholics (Kostick, 1996: 153-160; Patterson, 2006: 3). **Amidst the violence plaguing both embryonic states, Craig signalled his intention to consolidate a six-county state with a 2:1 Protestant majority by refusing to acknowledge the role of, or appoint a representative to, the Boundary Commission.** [source](http://www.trademarkbelfast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/The-social-and-historical-context-of-partition.pdf)",null,0,null,1425573695,null,0,false,0,cp59zx7,null,t3_2y130c,null,t1_cp59zx7,null,t1_cp599qe,null,null,null,1427594845,null,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2,null

The rest of Europe wears poppies too, and it's insanely disrespectful of you to complain about people wanting to remember the dead.

Here's a quote from the British Legion website:

&gt;The Legion created the Poppy Appeal to help those returning from the First World War. A century on from the start of that conflict, we're still helping today's Armed Forces families in much the same way, whether coping with bereavement, **living with disability, or finding employment.**

&gt; The poppy is a powerful symbol. It is worn to **commemorate the sacrifices of our Armed Forces and to show support to those still serving today and their loved ones.**
Money raised through the Poppy Appeal goes directly to our welfare work providing through life care to anyone who is currently serving in the British Armed Forces, who has previously served, and their families.

&gt;When you donate to the Poppy Appeal you help:
bereaved families to Live On 

&gt;**wounded Service men and women to Live On**

&gt;**younger veterans seeking employment and housing to Live On**

&gt;**older veterans needing age-related care to Live On**

&gt;Our vital welfare work is entirely dependent on the public's generous support – so please give generously and wear your poppy with pride, knowing that you are helping the Armed Forces community to Live On.

As you can see, I've highlighted a few things. Firstly, you can see that it commemorates *all* veterans, not just those in the World Wars. It includes and helps those that served during the Troubles.

The change it would take *would* be unprecedented given the stranglehold that the big two have on the media and in the home and in The House. Right now, even the Lib Dems, the third biggest party and junior coalition member, would have to win an extra 200 seats to even be the opposition, something that can't be achieved by taking every seat away from the 10 smaller parties/independents with seats in The House.  So yes, undemocratic-ish but also true.

But that's what the country has voted towards for generations, so in that sense, no, not undemocratic, but very much so in that no other party has a chance, but then again is it really undemocratic if that's what people have done and still do vote for? 

My point is that it's not as simple as saying that it's undemocratic if you believe in democracy &amp; the whole majority rules thing. What you may mean is that it's unfair on smaller parties/candidates/independents or the party you happen to support if you support one outside of the top two.

Now, when that became the stated goal many of us thought it was done to give Sully an out when we fell short.

Fact of the matter is, the board doesn't want to move forward with Sam at the helm. While being relegated in the last season at the Boleyn would be disastrous, that possibility is a much smaller blip on the radar than the possibility of making Europe next season and having the OS open to European football. This is what the board wants, above all else.

Sully (who now owns over 50% of the team and therefore over 50% of the say) has never liked Sam. He wanted Sam out last year but Brady and Gold talked some sense into him. They won't be so fortunate this time around. 

What this really boils down to is the ambition of the club and how the club views Sam...then the secondary rationales of money and pride come into play. What Sully wants is Europe. Our ambition is Europe at the OS. How Sully views Sam is as a relegation dodger and promotion specialist (a reputation hard earned over time). Those two things don't mesh. Sully doesn't view Sam as the type of manager who gets us into Europe.

Which brings us to this crucial offseason: if Sully and the board try to re-sign Sam it'll be to a one year deal to keep us from being relegated in our last year at Upton Park. But Sam is a prideful man, and prideful men don't take one year deals to be band aids. The board won't offer more than a year because they'll want a ""fresh face"" at the OS, and Sam won't take a year because he is worth more than a year.

So expect to see a new face. And before you say our managerial job isn't a desirable one, consider that Sam is the 13th best paid coach in football, with the job description he had simply reading ""get us promoted and keep us up"". The job description for the next manager will be ""Take us into this state-of-the-art stadium with entertaining football at a European level"". Considering what they paid Sam to get us up, they'll pay more to someone to get us to Europe.

null,false,Alwaysfair,null,null,null,"* The coalition government took office after the Great Recession, just as household
incomes were beginning their subsequent and inevitable decline. It would be
misleading to attribute all trends in living standards that occurred before May 2010
to Labour and all trends thereafter to the coalition.
* We project that real (RPIJ-adjusted) median household income is at around the same
level in 2014–15 as in 2007–08 (before the financial crisis), and about 2% below its
2009–10 peak.
* Having continued to rise slowly during the recession itself, real median household
income then fell by 4.0% from peak in 2009–10 to trough in 2011–12, driven by
falls in workers’ pay and in employment. This was a larger peak-to-trough fall than
occurred around the early 1990s recession (1.2%), but smaller than in the early
1980s (5.7%).
* Since then, employment has recovered strongly but real pay, and hence average
income, has not. This is consistent with the absence of productivity growth since
2011. Meanwhile, the coalition has implemented a large package of tax and benefit
measures taking money away from households in response to the structural budget
deficit caused or revealed by the crisis.
* The slow recovery in household incomes has been more remarkable by historical
standards than the peak-to-trough fall. We project that median household income
grew by just 1.8% in total between 2011–12 and 2014–15. In contrast, the first
three years of recovery in the early 1980s and early 1990s saw median income grow
by 9.2% and 5.1% respectively.
* Household consumption has also been very slow to recover by historical standards.
Consumption per head of non-durables (things such as food and fuel that are bought
and consumed roughly straightaway) was 3.8% lower in 2014Q3 than in 2008Q1. At
the same point after the 1980s and 1990s recessions, it was 14.4% and 6.4% above
pre-recession levels respectively. This might reflect households’ perceptions that
their income prospects have been permanently damaged by the crisis and that a
significant cut to their spending is therefore required.

* Assuming all households face the same inflation rate, income inequality is lower in
2014–15 than it was in 2007–08. This is explained by changes between 2007–08
and 2012–13, when earnings fell relative to benefits. Since 2012–13, incomes are
projected to have fallen towards the top and bottom of the distribution but risen
across the middle, in line with the distributional impact of recent tax and benefit
reforms.
* However, low-income families have faced higher-than-average inflation since 2007–
08. This is mostly due to price changes in the period up to and including 2009–10:
these families were hit harder by rising food and energy prices, and benefited less
from falling mortgage interest rates. When this is taken into account, the changes in
real incomes between 2007–08 and 2014–15 look similar across most of the income
distribution.
* The incomes of older individuals have caught up with those of the rest of the
population in recent years, while living standards have fallen the most for young
adults. After adjusting for group-specific inflation, median income among those
aged 60 and over is projected to be 1.8% higher in 2014–15 than in 2007–08,
compared with a 2.5% fall for those aged 31–59 and a 7.6% fall for those aged 22–
30.
* In the long run, policies that spur productivity growth will have the most significant
effect on living standards. Over the course of the next parliament, the choices that
the next government makes about the shape and size of any further fiscal
consolidation will also affect how the living standards of different groups change.

&gt;The whole fucking point of reddit is so that you can have arguments without vote manipulation.

No, it isn't. The point of Reddit is to have DISCUSSION and DEBATE, which are *not* arguments. Upvotes are to bump up worthy, thoughtful posts, and downvotes are to downvote worthless, one-word, or thoughtless or inflammatory posts, like yours.

&gt;You have just broken redditquette, and admitted to it

Impressive mental gymnastics. You were acting inflammatory and rude, adding nothing to what little discussion there was.

If he doesn't make the grade as a good transfer, that's the fault of the transfer committee, not the player. The problem is that some muppets decide to attack him personally because he hasn't lived up to the price, instead of recognising that he's been performing similarly to Skrtel, Can and Sakho. All four have had bad games at some point in this season, and Lovren's form was poor enough that he was (rightly) dropped from the team. But after being reinstated following Sakho's injury, he hasn't had a bad game. The only thing he's really done wrong in that time was miss the penalty.

Compare him to the stick Lallana gets whenever he isn't putting the ball in the net twice in a game. It's the same story: maybe we overpaid for him, but that doesn't make him a worse player. We've got him now, so we should recognise his contribution.

If you want a life full of material riches don't have kids, period. DINK (dual income, no kids) life is pretty good. But the emotional riches of raising a little human being made of you and your partner's DNA is pretty fucking awesome too (sez the dude who became a dad this week - I am loving it). 

Also, do not make the assumption your career and earnings potential goes on ice once you have kids. Your mum took her entire 40s off. She came back to work with badly out of date skills (assuming you're 24, I'm guessing she took off the 90s meaning that when she came back she may not have ever used a PC in a workplace environment) and employers probably assume she has one eye on retirement and little desire to throw herself back into work when she's got two kids at home who come first. I suspect your mum would probably admit this herself. Good on her I say, she made that choice and it was the best thing for you and your sister. But she was probably just as happy to sell off the extra car and have a few Butlins holidays rather than rent a villa in France for a week. 

Having kids is a hard choice with a lot of pitfalls, but in the end you gotta jump off the deep end - if you think you can really line all your ducks up before having kids, you're lying to yourself. It's one thing to do what some of my friends did, which was go ""Cool, we need to leave London and go back to Brum where we can buy a house for less than half a million quid and be near our parents"", but it's another to be like a friend who decided she could NOT have kids until she owned a home in London.

he comes back to a new formation and a few positional changes that transform the team and playing style like Can in defence which has been a revelation, for a time Lucas in DM and Sterling upfront and now the team generates so much attacking pressure that we draw comparisons to our style of last season. Migs comes back into the side, much less pressure on the defence and just doesnt make the same fuck ups he was prone to. 4 of the points OP made are things he's always done, they are not new things he is doing, he's just not as bad.

i didn't insult him, i didn't put him down, i just said I acknowledge he's clearly improved but with the knowledge of how bad things were for us it would be more ideal to ensure we never risk getting another run of form like he had

You can't blame Davies alone, and you can't blame Bentaleb. Our CB's played cohesively to close down space. There were three different attitudes in defending that cross. 

Vert/Dier: Zonal marking. THey covered space together with Oliveiera being the main concern. 

Davies: Drifted from LB to follow Routledge in a man-to-man system. 

Bentaleb: Started with zonal and saw Siggy drift wide, and without visually confirming, expected Davies to stick to his zonal position to cover that gap. 

The breakdown is that the whole understanding is not cohesive and that takes time to gel it all together with all your defending pieces, not just your back four.

Let me first start off by saying Mingolet is doing great, hes a good keeper. 

This is simply a discussion about his kicking and nothing more.

No no no. Countinho is shooting at a target. Mingolet is simply tasked with kicking it far. Literally swing a leg and get it as far away as possible.

Mingolet struggles with that on a weekly basis. This is the point being made.


Thanks for providing the stats for me. 

Mingolets average distance of distribution 37m, with 68%. By contrast De Gea is 35m and 67%. 
Very similar figures.

When comparing this data to the other keepers in that list.
This simply shows its:

A) a product of making easier passes

B) a product of defenders making themselves easier targets

C) a product of the play style of the team.

Mingolets passing has never been an issue. He rarely has difficulty with the short passing.

Are you talking about Lamela?  He has rarely ever done that with Spurs.  He's certainly never created much space.  I think you thinking about the player that we all thought Lamela *was* than *is.*

On the other hand, Townsend did that.  He created space and pulled players around.  Plus, you never know when you can start a counter-attack.  Townsend's speed in necessary to mount an effective one.

I will admit that Townsend did make plenty of mistakes as well and made some infuriating errors, but it's as if Lamela has been immune to those sort of problems.   Between the two, Townsend just offers us more and makes us a more balanced side.    Maybe one day, Lamela will realize his potential and be that player we all thought he could be.

That and the new sponsorship and TV deals mean that in a season or two Chelsea won't need to sell to buy.

In other words, is his work ethic above Harry Kane?  Does Soldado work harder than Christian Eriksen?  What about the rest of our also-crap players?  Does he have a better work ethic that Shaq Coulthirst?  Etienne Capoue? Youves Kaboul?

What evidence is there that Soldado has a work ethic that deserves mention?

But there's a balance, don't spend too little either, you want a dry refuge that is easy to put up and stays up.

Also consider the weight and packing method, some tents weigh more than others of a similar capacity due to extra poles etc, and those 'instant' tents might seem great but you're effectively burdened with a huge heavy disc to carry, not fun across a few blustery fields in the rain. Glastonbury does require festival goers to park away from the camping for the most part.

Check local Gumtree for any good used bargains, people upgrade all the time and you might luck out and get a pro tent for a fraction of the cost, or alternatively browse the main outdoor shops for sales, it's not festival season so this might help your cause as nobody wants a tent this time of year so they could be on sale.

Last advice, and tangential, get a cheap Nokia burner phone that will accept your SIM, taking an expensive smartphone to a festival is asking for trouble and the queues for charging points can be absurd, better that you have a few days away from Facebook etc but are still able to text each other if separated etc, and have longer battery life.

There certainly should be a cap on benefits in general, yes they don't compare in the amount spent compared to lost taxes, but a penny saved!

Benefits are supposed to be something to get you back on your feet if something bad happens, You shouldn't be able to live indefinitely on the backs of others without contributing back to society. 

Cap child benefits to x children, 
Unemployment benefits should only be available for say 1 year (except for disability / extenuating circumstances) every 5 years. 
Housing benefits is a tricky one, but can be sorted if the house market and the price abuse from landlords it got under control!

null,false,theanonymousthing,logo,,null,"You know, pellegrini has frustrated me to no end before but never once have i though sacking him would be the right decision.

He is capable of making this team play beautiful liquid football. Last year we had the whole league in awe in the way we whizzed it about on the pitch. We won and we won well; 3-0's,4-0's,5-0's,6-0's. The only thing that cost us last year was our defence.

Pellegrini in his first year won us the league and the Capitol one Cup as well as taking us the furthest into the Champions League as we have ever been before. 

This is only his second year and we are in 2nd place. Seriously its ridiculous. We need to get behind pellegrini and show him he has our trust, we need to get behind the lads when they need us and be the 12th man. Sure we might not win anything this year but how can you expect him to establish long term success if he's only given 2 years. I mean this man won so much it would be incredibly fickle to suddenly turn on him after one disappointing season. Rome wasn't built in a day and we are still in a period of transition.

Our Defence, which cost us a lot last year, is still new and being worked on. The transfers, though he does have a degree of influence, are largley worked by Txiki-who is doing a fantastic job in other areas. Theres nothing wrong with a club of City's stature and resources wanting success but you cant expect it to be instantaneous. Legacy's take time and sacking Pellegrini would only bring instability. It would send the wrong message to other managers that city is an unstable club and it would send the wrong message to the players.

Im not saying pellegrini is perfect, far from it but he is undeniably a fantastic manager. Look what he did with villareal when he was given time and support, look what he did with malaga when he was given time and support now imagine what he could do with city if he was given time and full support.

He has done a lot for us and under immense pressure, I say again in his first year at city and in the EPL:

(i)he won us the league:

(ii) we broke our goal scoring record by some amount

(iii) we had 5 or so players on +20 goals, 

(iv) there was harmony in the dressing room and we wherent in the news every 5 minutes. 

(v) capitol one cup for what its worth

Pellegrini is gentleman and has my utter respect. Sure it wont stop me from questioning him or being critical of him when i think it warrants it. I know that there only rumors and a majority of city fans are still resolutely behind pellers, I just hope he doesnt have to go through the speculation Mancini did.",null,0,null,1425581078,null,0,false,0,cp5ejsc,null,t3_2y1auf,null,t1_cp5ejsc,null,t3_2y1auf,null,null,null,1427596972,null,26,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,26,null

Also, if you were down on the mortgage but not paying, how much of the property would you actually own? And I don't know if I am correct but I don't think you would be allowed to get a mortgage if you weren't paying anything towards it, because as your salary is being taken into account when assessing they would be expecting you to be contributing to it.

Finally, the other issue is around what your mum would do if you had to move out. She can't get a mortgage now, so she won't be able to get one in the future either.

A lot of fans dislike the next option which is through the clubs resale partner Viagogo. This will be more expensive.

The FB group is cheapest (or the same as the official site) but can be a bit of hassle obtaining the ticket. Some United fans have been known to get on it and pretend they have tickets.

Having said that a friend got a ticket through Viagogo and when he got to go in the ground the person selling the ticket on there had also used the ticket and my friend couldn't get in. Fortunately the club sorted him out in the end!

I'd recommend the football museum in the center of Manchester (it's free to get in). There's not a lot to do around the stadium. Pubs only really come alive an hour before kickoff.

I'd like to start off by saying I enjoyed the article. Well put, and i'm glad the author enjoys how we play right now.

Best tactic for Chelsea? No, I think Bayern have clearly shown how counter that tactic. Man marking their most distributive players and not allowing them space with high pressure inside the middle field. Forcing them to go wide with a ball or cross (which would fail cus they're short). If everyone employs this tactic against us, I think we would fail. What made Barca so good at it is:

A) The have a fuck ton of players that can distribute

B) They are all evasive (in terms of dribbling).

If you stayed on a man, you would find yourself on a 1 on 1 challenge vs Messi, Neymar, Sanchez (when he was there), David Villa (when he was there), Pedro, Xavi, or Iniesta. Who basically forced space or a double team. Which in turn left a man open.

If we look at our squad, and applied that man marking with high pressure defense. Only Hazard, Willian, and maybe Oscar would survive in terms of evasiveness. Then in terms of passing, we'd have Oscar and Cesc only. 

What can do is copy what Jose's Madrid did with fast pace counters, or fast past teammwork like Dortmund/Jupp's Bayern would be best. Maybe even find a way to employ long ball cross field more like we did at the beginning of the season. Ivanovic thrived off those, and it seems like the amount of long balls have slowly but surely dwindled down.

But as of now, I think what we have is a great, but Tiki Taka would fail for us because we don't have enough evasive/passing gifted players to preform such tactic.

This is my opinion (sorry if it offends anyone), but i'd prefer for you guys instead of downvoting tell me why i'm wrong.

None of us would have - but the man's delivered in spades, and I don't think anyone really can disagree with that. 

All I'm saying is it would be very short-sighted to see what Sam's done with a simple request of ""try to win more, and make it pretty"" and assume that ""put us into Europe"" is beyond his means.

Whilst being scanned to see whether she had pyometra, I was outside the vets in some state making a distraught phonecall. After the call, I went back into the vets and was told she did have it and there were only 2 options as it was so bad. I could leave her there and she could have the surgery the same day, or I could go home without her and she would be put to sleep. I left the surgery in a daze almost collapsing outside. I went home to await news of her operation. I was home less than an hour when the vet called to say it was a success AND a stranger overheard my call and wished to contribute to Magics vet bill..

It can be. I didnt read the article but if we win big this year then the confidence and maturity will develop. We already play good football but I think next year we can play great football. These things take time but this season has kind of cemented the new Chelsea ""project"" if you will. Its really exciting that this is just the first season for quite a few of these players to be playing together.

I want to see attractive football more than anything and I dont buy the excuse that we wont win if we play that way (that is what you get from small minded fans with small expectations who want to settle for mediocrity with regards to how we play).Its honestly insulting that people say we need to park the bus to win, its bad enough when other fans say it but when actual fans of Chelsea say it and think it the only way we can win speaks volumes.

Its also pressing to note that pellers attacking football is some of the sexiest in the modern game.

Having said this there are some really big flaws in MPs approach that would leave me to look for a replacement at the end of his contract.

1. He's too god damn stubborn. We've been working with a high line defence with overlapping fullbacks, and he wonders why were fucked at the back. Only made worse when he pairs Vinnie with manga and the both run at the nearest attacking player, regardless of position. He needs to realise when things don't work and adapt.

2. His transfers have been lacklustre to say the least. I realise txiki has a lot to do with these, but MP can't escape the blame. I can't help but think carvalho&gt;Fernando, laporte&gt;manga (admittedly not a huge difference on this one). Like it was pretty clear manga was meant to grow into a vinne manga partnership to form our defence for the next era. Instead we have demi as our best cb with a year left in his career or so. That now leaves us with an unstable and quite frankly terrifying manga komps partnership. With rekik and denayer both promising but inexperienced transfer have essentially fucked our defence (as well as poor tactics).

3. Youth. Pellers is so god damn stubborn about fielding top quality every game its hard to see any youngsters getting looks. I would have much rather seen Jove and dezeko stay backups, bony never bought and a 4th striker spot given to iheanacho, Cole etc from the eds. We have arguably one of the best up and coming youth programs in world football and its going to waste under Manuel.

Again, I don't think he needs a sacking right now, but he does at least need a redirecting/outside pressure to force divergence from his comfort zone.

Unlike human deminers with metal detectors, the rats detect explosive chemicals and ignore uncontaminated scrap metal, making them highly efficient landmine detectors. 

They are super efficient and cost effective too. They were designed as a locally sourced, low cost solution for low resourced countries who otherwise cannot finance the removal of landmines, which they are required to do under the Ottawa convention (Every country has a different timetable). The rats have found more than 47,000 landmines and UXO to date. 

APOPO's approach fully adheres to international standards for Land Release with the rats considered as effective as manual deminers. Machines alone are not suitable for the task as they simply can't reach the required standards, soe other organisations use mine detection dogs but we think there are some [special advantages to the rats](https://www.apopo.org/en/about/our-work/why-rats). 

Landmines aren't too difficult to find with the right technology and consequently we can approve land for release to communities once they have been formally evaluated by the rats. All of the rats have to be accredited and pass a strict blind test without any failures before they can be used in the field.

If you have to choose a segment of the population to target for cuts and the like, the young would still be the first choice even with 75% voter turnout.

Additionally, my vote is meant to provide me with representation, but under the current system of first past the post, if I vote for anyone but the winner, my vote becomes worthless. My constituency is a Tory seat. You could get double the amount of young people to vote and it would still be a Tory seat. In terms of representation, I get zero whether I vote or not.

As a young person, the problem is literally that you aren't proportionally represented. If I don't vote, I contribute to a lower voter-turnout and the media asks why young people aren't voting. If I do vote, I contribute to a higher voter-turnout, which gives people less reason to question our voting system and allows the politicians with the power to change it to say ""all these people are clearly happy to participate in the current voting system, why would we change it?""

The only reason for young people to vote is if they live in a contested constituency and there's a party with a chance of winning that could help prevent a majority government (coalitions cast first past the post in a negative light), otherwise their vote ends up being ultimately irrelevant at best, if not actively harmful to their own wellbeing.

Edit: Trying to figure out the numbers. 18-24 year olds make up roughly 7.5% of the voting population and if we increased their turnout by 30% (70% turnout), they'd make up roughly 9.75% of the voting population. Even if young people voted at the same rate as older generations, it would equate to an increase of 2.25% of the votes compared to the 2010 election.

Devon and Somerset are a little better off and at least they stay in a national scale of deprivation, but on the whole - I'd say the SW as a region is as fucked as most of the grimmest places I have been to in the North.

On a positive note its quite nice here and we have Pasties.  The weather is warm and we can go surfing all the year round so we do have that going for us.

null,false,lovechip,null,null,null,"I'd suggest getting a tent with a separate, sheltered porch in case it rains a lot, that way you have a place to sit and take off muddy wellies. If you can open up the porch and sit with the tent open to get some air, this will help you in the morning when the sun gets on you.

Get one with an inner and an outer layer, not one that's just single skin. It will keep you dry!

If you can, get one with as much head space as possible. Putting tights on wriggling about on your back and sweating in a tent is quite tricky. So is putting on make-up whilst not being able to sit up straight.

I had a great tent from age 13 until 29 and it's still in decent condition. It wasn't that expensive, just good quality. 

Also, when you pitch your tent, if you're on a slope, point the entrance of the tent downhill, so if it rains the water doesn't roll up to your front door. I've seen bad things happen to people who got this wrong. Keep away from the edge of the paths. There's really a very, very, very low chance of getting your tent slashed at Glastonbury. It's not that kind of atmosphere. That's more at Reading and Leeds. 

This is making me wish I was going this year. Must remember the two, sunny holidays I'm having instead! Hope you have an amazing time!!!!!

Having been to many, many festivals in my time, I'd now recommend a tunnel-type tent if you can, rather than a large dome. Dome tents look great and are brilliant for being able to stand up in if they're tall enough, but that height in itself makes it a pain in the ass in high winds (the one I had which got packed down and abandoned at Wilderness was a tall dome, and both main poles snapped, plus one of the sidewalls ripped - got to love summer time in the UK!). Our friends have a tunnel tent coming up to about 6 years old now, and despite a bit of patching here and there, it's survived festivals and camping trips all over the UK, including loads of use up in Scotland in rain, wind and all sorts. 


I'd definitely recommend that if you have the money, get something with a porch area as big as your bedroom area. You'll be really thankful of it in bad weather, because you'll have somewhere to ditch wet, muddy wellies and waterproofs without getting festival shit all over your sleeping area. 

In terms of brand, the big names are obviously going to last you much longer, but it depends on how committed you are about going to other festivals with mates across the summer or next year. Vango, Gelert, Sunncamp etc are all great, but the brand name comes with a big cost - ones I'm looking at right now look lovely for me and my other half, but he'd go mad if I bought one full price, because they're heading up to £200 - and that's in the sales! :-/

Fair enough if that's your view, but they don't match the stereotype you outlined earlier. 

&gt; Lots of things have happened in politics in the current parliament, but students have 100% latched onto tuition fees as though young people are a single-issue demographic.

It's an issue that gets a lot of traction, but '100%'? Just goes to show that 72.8% of statistics on the internet are made up.

&gt; They didn't get what they wanted from tuition fees*, so they've thrown all their toys out the pram and have collectively decided to 'punish' the LibDems by collectively putting Clegg on the same pedestal as Thatcher.

So young people who voted LibDem partly because they *pledged* (not a vague smoke-signal, a *pledge*) to vote against tuition fee increases, who then watched from the sidelines as the LibDems voted for tripling tuition fees are somehow in the wrong for distrusting the LibDems? I know people who voted LibDem in 2010 with the hope of going to university later on, but not anymore since they've been effectively priced out of higher education.

&gt; The LibDems did their best for students and tuition fees (lots of political capital spent), and shit was their thanks.

At the same time the Soviet union went even further than child benefit and even imposed a tax on childlessness, did they have the same baby boom? 

I think most would argue that the post war baby boom was largely made possible by the extremely rapid developments in science and technology, along with cheap oil, which dramatically reduced the cost of living across the board. In particular, agricultural scientists discovered cross-pollination in the late 40's and 50's which was found to produce exponentially higher crop yields. This decimated the cost of food

This is a huge contribution to the failure of the Soviet union, as Stalin closed the door on all of these developments by closing scientific communication with the west (he shot scientists who used western theories). He then blew half the country's budget on failed attempts to feed the country, such as dropping billions of seeds in Siberia in the hope it would become grassland.

I don't think child benefit was a significant contribution to the post war baby boom int he west. However reading the wiki page on the Soviet tax on childlessness, it's argued that this did increase the fertility rate, however taxing single people is very likely to be a bigger incentive than offering a benefit to parents isn't it?",null,0,null,1425587165,null,0,1425587769,0,cp5icaa,null,t3_2y0bb8,null,t1_cp5icaa,null,t1_cp51l2c,null,null,null,1427598754,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Yes. You can't get everything you want your favourite party doesn't win a majority.

&gt;I know people who voted LibDem in 2010 with the hope of going to university later on, but not anymore since they've been effectively priced out of higher education.

Your acquaintances are either dishonest or ill-informed. No one has been priced out of higher education. Not a single person.

&gt;If I break a promise, it's my fault and I must live with the consequences.

Not in cases of *force majeure*. There's no doubt the LibDems *wanted* to reform tuition fees as they described, but the Conservatives wouldn't support it. Do they break every other election pledge by removing themselves from government, or do they selectively action policies to the best of their ability to maximise their political capital?

null,false,Sir_Bantersaurus,null,null,null,"&gt; Then you have the influence of the media, the influence of private funding of political parties and private interests on politicians. I don't personally see the statement that our democratic system has failed is hyperbolic; I think our democratic system fails to represent a significant proportion of our population and this is aided by media influence that allows a significant amount of misinformation to be spread.

There are flaws in our democratic system but these flaws do not mean that the democratic process has failed. We need to be able to differentiate between the two because stating that is failed is extreme and would strike a lot of people around the world as lacking perspective. 

There are many places you could examine if you wanted to see where democracy has truly failed and the UK doesn't compare.  Egypt post-revolution is an examine of where it as failed. Some South American countries too. Many countries in the middle east. There are many places where the constitutional protection is simply not there. The idea isn't that strong or it's been circumvented by force.  

What would you do about the media by the way? We have a (mostly) a free press in the UK and they're free to publish what they want. Everyone complains that the press is biased against them but it's human nature to live in a bubble. People tend to solicit opinions that agree with their own. Reddit does this too. /r/UnitedKingdom I would argue to considerably to the left of mainstream British opinion. It's a younger, more liberal, demographic. Even the UKIPers we have on here are usually libertarians. It's isn't really that different from older Conservatives buying the Daily Mail. 

I don't think the media is really a problem with our democracy or at least I don't think there is a solution to it which wouldn't make things worse. 

&gt; Not to mention that I don't think the flaws of the FPTP system can be dismissed as easily as they seem to be in your post.

I am not dismissing it. I am not a fan of FPTP either. Especially in a country which is increasingly diverse in terms of party representation. I voted for the voting reform 5 years ago and I will likely vote for a party that supports reform this time around as well.

But there is a difference between recognising these flaws and believing they mean a entire failure of the democratic process. The very fact I can choose to vote to reform it, that Scotland could vote to break up the country, that we can vote for a party that will change things means it hasn't completely failed.

I understand how coalitions work. I also understand how pledges work, namely that you don't break them under any conditions.

&gt; Your acquaintances are either dishonest or ill-informed. No one has been priced out of higher education. Not a single person.

They have. They do not wish to take out loans and saved money accordingly. Thanks to the tuition fee trebling, that's no longer an option (unless you're rich of course).

&gt; Not in cases of force majeure. There's no doubt the LibDems wanted to reform tuition fees as they described, but the Conservatives wouldn't support it. Do they break every other election pledge by removing themselves from government, or do they selectively action policies to the best of their ability to maximise their political capital?

Firstly, they should have clearly specified in May 2010 what their policy 'red lines' were when formulating the Coalition Agreement. If the Conservatives refused to acknowledge their red lines, they should have looked at a confidence-and-supply agreement instead of a full coalition.

Citation needed. 

His chart shows a whopping 16 Met Police officers were suspended in 2013/14. A rise of 1 person from the previous year. Truly endemic. I don't count the specials because it's not their full time job, so they're always going to be susceptible to approach from shady folk. Not to mention, the Met is the largest force, and largely believed by most, certainly here on reddit anyway, to be the most corrupt in the country. If 16 suspended Police officers in 20 thousand is the most corrupt we've got in the nation, I think anybody who thinks corruption is endemic in British policing isn't being rational with their beliefs.

If I ask you why we never touched

You shrug it off and say ‘Who knows.’

But it fills our home with hatred.

Just toss a coin and we’ll decide who goes

‘Cause no one should be lonely inside such a tiny space

I wish I could wipe you out

Your cryptic laugh, your hands and your new face

We used to make the same sounds too

But we used to be so much louder

A perfect duet for me and you

Sung with feeling, so much prouder

But now all we sing between dead air 

is ‘Fuck you’ and ‘Who were you with today?’

I don’t think either of us care

It just gives us something else to say.

This is the kind of black-and-white thinking that makes politics a joke. The LibDems had two choices; abstain from the vote on tuition fees (and bring the government down, causing untold misery and hardship for the country in the process), or try to strike the best deal they could for students with their pledge in mind.

From even a simple utilitarian perspective, it's plainly obvious the LibDems have done the best thing to improve the overall system. It's like a local mayor promised to hold the village fete on the public green, but when faced with the fact the village green is flooded he decided to hold it in a less attractive field (and be called a liar for the effort).

ALL that being said, the new system is better for the vast majority of graduates. Not just in the obvious monthly-repayment sense, but also the total amount payable, too.

IMHO that says more about the inherent racism everyone has &amp; how they stick to their own. The same observation can be made about any organized child abuse group, be it politicians, BBC celebrities, priests or kebab makers. Most people stick to their own in most aspects of life, be it criminal or otherwise.

For which he gets almost none of the credit and the vast majority of the blame. Hard to say it's worked out well for him. He's a laughingstock south of the border.

&gt; it's hardly Brown's fault the British people wouldn't vote for traditional Labour politicians anymore forcing the likes of Brown to align their politics with the Thatcherite middle ground. 

That is an enormous ex post facto rationalisation of the Blair years. The fact is John Smith, who was a moderniser but connected to the tradition of Labour, was wiping the floor with the Tory party and virtually anybody - hell, they could have bought back Michael Foot - would have led the Labour party to a majority in 1997. Blair took that huge majority and did...err, well, he introduced the minimum wage! (OK, he did a few other things too.) Labour had their greatest mandate since Clement Attlee and pissed most of it away. 

&gt; In 2010 Labour were tired and out of ideas as was Brown they were bound to lose at some point, Brown's biggest failure was that he thought he could go on and on, Blair for all his faults knew when to quit.

Brown's biggest failure was not going ""Oh, go fuck yourself, you vapid cunt"" over lamb chops and rioja at Granita and running against Blair instead.

If anybody was engaged in black-and-white thinking, it was the LibDems. The LibDems made a clear pledge and then reneged on it. Their leader publicly admitted this was a mistake on their part yet you think disillusioned LibDem voters are in the wrong over this sorry affair?

&gt; The LibDems had two choices; 

Fallacy of the false dichotomy.

They had several options open to them. Namely as I pointed out, they could have refused to enter into a full coalition with the Conservatives unless the latter agreed in the Coalition Agreement to respect and work around the LibDem tuition fee pledge. 

&gt; abstain from the vote on tuition fees (and bring the government down, causing untold misery and hardship for the country in the process)

Inaccurate.

Governments lose votes in the Commons all the time. The votes that actually bring down governments are rejected money bills (most notably, annual budgets) and no-confidence motions. The tuition-fee increase was neither.

&gt; ALL that being said, the new system is better for the vast majority of graduates.

I don't actually disagree completely, but that's largely beside the point. The LibDems made a pledge, the pledge attracted younger voters to the party, the LibDems broke the pledge and instantly killed off their credibility and a huge chunk of their support.

Its not difficult, if there is a group of Pakistani men who wantonly abused vulnerable people, then they're fucking sickos. That's not saying that all Pakistani men or Pakistani people altogether are sickos, but you need to address the prominent minority within that group, as should be done to all groups that have rogue elements.

oh man, im so hurt you downvoted me. my argument isn't weak, you are going to sit there think you're right. migs kicking the ball out 3 times in one match? oh my god he's horrible at distributing the ball. get off your high horse 'buddy', what ticked me off is your general approach. 

i would be really appreciative if you could do me a favor and watch every match this weekend and provide me with a full report on all epl keeps. im really quite curious to see how much you'll back track those comments after a full weekend of games. in addition, yea clearing a ball is pretty simple. but if migs clears it 60 meters and it goes out of bounds, was that a successful or unsuccessful clearance? 

based on that same criteria, if migs clears it 70 meter down the field, it goes straight to an opposition player who then in turn pings a 45 meter pass to his striker and he gets a chance on goal, which do you think is better?

now on that note, since my argument is so weak, i will let you walk away from this discussion. your argument is weak and the point you make is the same cop out answer that ever detractor that migs has. it is unimaginable that you even watch games. you're initial argument, and i quote, "" Doesnt really matter how much pressure he's under. Kicking a ball is a fundamental of the game. His kicking is poor, and this is an example of that.
You dont get perfect moments in a game to take your sweet time to kick the ball.
He's greatly improved, but people glossing over his poor kicking is just irritating. Everyone keeps making excuses for it when theres no need.""

so it doesn't matter how much pressure he's under? if neuer has eden hazard 3 yards in front of him, does neuer get the ball off and out of trouble if he just puts his foot through the ball and kicks it? no...there is a reason players chase keepers down, even though it seems pointless. because the pressure can cause errors. migs, under pressure and like most keepers, won't always be able to clear the ball in play. and im ok with that, b/c if migs can't clear it in such a way that is safe for our team, i'd rather it go out of bounds and let our defense reset.

anyways dude...keep running away, im going to make sure that people do not gloss over mignolet's 'poor' kicking. he kicked the ball out 2-3 times last night. fucking cry me a river, im telling you watch all 10 matches in matchweek 29, and count how many keepers hit that number of misplaced clearances. you'll be rudely surprised and i'm going to go out on a limb, you'll probably want to apologize for being a big fat baby.",null,0,null,1425591453,null,0,false,0,cp5l25e,null,t3_2y0oi7,null,t1_cp5l25e,null,t1_cp5isrp,null,null,null,1427600021,null,-1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-1,null

null,false,q_pop,null,null,null,"Dimensional are an odd case. They offer relatively low cost investments that act like index trackers but don't track an index. Instead they follow ""factor models"" as popularised by Fama/French. 

This means they target companies that might be undervalued, and bias towards small caps (both factors are suggested to outperform the markets as a whole in he long run).

Dimensional cannot be accessed by a private investor, as the company believe strongly in advisers. This also means that independent information is not readily available. I have reviewed them and personally feel the funds are a tad expensive for a tracker-esque investment.

If you believe in the investment methodology you are not making a poor choice. It doesn't sound like you are being overcharged either. In my advice practice I too would charge ""a few hundred quid"" to advice you on investments, and contrary to some opinions on here I think there can be a lot of value in that.

Edit: to add, although the stock market is at a high in a points basis, if you look at an measure that looks at price vs earnings (arguably a far more sensible measure) we are a good way off all time highs globally.

As for the dressing room, Pellegrini systematically freezes out any young talent we have and signs 26 year olds to replace them. We're running ourselves into an FFP nightmare. 

All I'm saying is if 2nd wasn't good for the manager who led us to a title and then got given fucking Scott Sinclair and Jack Roswell to try to replicate it, why is it fine for the one who gets a 32m CB and a 28m centre forward. He didn't lose the dressing room, he wasn't a board room yes man and got shipped out for 'holistics'. 

I add, I loved last season but its not been replicated. What's the magical belief he's gonna get it back? Where's the evidence?

Agree wholeheartedly, that's why I keep arguing this debate. 

Another issue is the focus on statistics, if you measure the police performance by their conviction rates then you create incentives to not even record certain types of crime. Rape is one of them, back before DNA tests were cheap and readily available it often came down to one persons word against the other which simply isn't enough for ""beyond reasonable doubt"".

add all of those up and you've barely made an hour commute and are over budget by £100. And that's one of the cheapest options I know of.

Is our fantastic back up 'keeper. Signed when we were in the championship after our 27 years in the prem. We got him off Sunderland who were glad to see the back of him as they largely regarded him as a bit shit. 

However for us he was unbelievable and one of the few shining lights in our dismal championship seasons. He stuck with us through relegation to league 1 despite interest from other clubs (can't remember who though sorry). Generally a rock at the back for our league 1 years his form began to fade as we got back into the championship and despite our promotion a large portion of saints fans believed we needed a change in the prem which came in the form of Gazza, Boruc and eventually Forster. 

In terms of playing style he was very much your old fashioned english shot stopper. Not brilliant in the air due to his height and shite at kicking/throwing it out. But some of his stops were outrageous and on his day he was near unbeatable. Moreover his experience doubtlessly helped settle out defence. 

It should be stressed that Kelvin was club captain for quite some time and carries a MASSIVE presence in the dressing room. He's been there and done it and everyone knows and respects him for it. An all round cracking bloke who has time for the fans always. 

An acquaintance who used to play in the academy said he'd regularly come and watch the youngsters and actually talk and engage with them. He said that once he was tricked into telling Kelvin to ""hurry up and get changed"" in response Kelvin grabbed him in a bear hug and (i think this is right) carried him to the shower and joked about ruining switching it on and ruining his hair.

Harry Kane plays for the badge (and I'm not calling this into question), Townsend and Mason play for the badge as well. However these players are also enjoying their football and playing well in positions they know, and roles they can perform.

Soldado, he's on another level. Soldado is the absolute best representative for this club on the pitch, despite some of his very recent mistakes. I would keep Soldado at this club purely on the basis of his fucking incredible attitude and the amazing respect he has shown this club. 

Soldado built his name, his reputation, and his entire image on his goalscoring prowess. He came to Spurs and it just did not happen for him. The goals did not come, and it quickly became evident that he was contributing very little without scoring. He didn't cry, he didn't quit, he didn't even point fingers at the service, which my previous post pointed out was lacking. He fucking redoubled his efforts. When that didn't work out the guy alters his playstyle so that he can still offer something. He turned provider, and happily stepped back to become a cog in the machine, and a very functional and hard working cog at that.

**Please note that this next part is not a detraction from our young players, and is in no way meant to take away from their achievements.**

Being picked every week, playing with confidence, growing up near the club, supporting the club as a kid, and coming through the clubs academy and having their support and guidance turn you into a world class football. Each of these things makes it easier to love the club and ""play for the badge.""

Coming into a club that's rebuilding, a club who buy a ""specialist"" player and give him poor tools to work with, a club with an uncertain season, 2 managers with wildly different ideals and tactical nuance, both of whom have no idea how to get the best from you, and one who seemingly writes you off early on... To get through all that and still remain at the club, still put in the effort every chance you get, and still despair when you fail, and still insist that YOU can turn it around and YOU want to be better for the club and the fans. That takes a lot.

Fuck me, to get through all that and still give it everything and want to succeed here, that makes you a fucking legend. I'm happy enough for people to think Soldado won't come good, Hell if people want him sold I can understand that. However just understand that no matter what happens this guy deserves your respect.

It is comparable. Its comparable to when the problems started. Its comparable to every manager in Europe. Few managers go trophyless in second seasons and pull it back to winning ways. Its simple stats. Faith in managers is rarely rewarded.

As for bust ups, Ferguson had bust ups. Beckham left, Keane left, Ince left and Hughes left all after spats with him. His board as much as I've advocated the disposability of managers earlier, stood behind him and said that player power didn't matter. Pellegrini looks to have great control over the dressing room as our lacklustre and unmotivated performances as of late demonstrate.

The truth is we're arguing a point that only the future can tell us whose right but only if he stays. I do personally reckon he will get another season as I think the long term goal has always been Pep and that's when Pep's contract times out. What he won't get is the spending he's become accustomed to this summer.

Personally, my opinion is that Starkey called Brown out on the way he spent tax money trying to make us all in some way tied to the benefits system. He sold our gold reserves for peanuts, he failed in every way as a Chancellor and then as PM. Brown may be a saint, who cares?

It is not the be all and end all, but regardless it is still important-that's kinda one of the main reasons we have tables in the first place (to differentiate between unis).

The question about whether the material is harder at Lancaster is probably nigh on impossible to answer unless somebody has studied at both unis. You can expect to be challenged and pushed at Lancaster, but Glasgow will also do the same. Sometimes unis are placed higher in standings not because their courses are more difficult, but because of the quality of teaching students receive. It's really difficult to answer your question, I would recommend researching what the course content is, comparing that to what you think you are good at and then topping this all of by trying to speak to some alumni of each university.

In regards to being internationally prestigious I would say that Glasgow probably has the edge. This is going of a hypothesis I've just made up my head, but more people will internationally will have heard of Glasgow rather than Lancaster. I am confident both will be sufficiently impressive abroad, but maybe Glasgow will have the edge because the city itself is more famous (I didn't know Lancaster had a uni until about a year ago when I was also looking for places to go uni).

1: Yes there actually is a reason. I'm a full-time writer and publisher. I have out several humorous sci-fi books and get a tattoo for each book (though I'm one behind right now). In my third book (SHATNERQUEST) there's a Dalek that's a tribble exterminator. It also doesn't hurt that I love DOCTOR WHO.

2: It took about two to three hours (I don't really remember the exact amount of time but it was somewhere in there). It actually barely hurt at all. My artist had a very light hand. Here's two other tattoos he did for me. This one is the logo the horror publishing company I run, Deadite Press: http://imgur.com/4EZYGaH  And this one is one of the logos for bizarro (the genre that I write in): http://imgur.com/i8aqmQG

Does he run more than Harry Kane? Does he have Eriksen's touch? What about Mason's tenacity? Bentaleb's ability to read the game? Does he excel at any of those things? Somebody else picked up on this and I agree. I've been saying this for months now, but I genuinely don't think he has a spot on the team, whether it's backup #10, second striker (well, after this season anyway), central mid, winger, whatever. 

It's so blatantly disrespectful to the rest of the squad, in my opinion, that Soldado is the one singled out for his ""work ethic"" and ""great effort"" when the entire team ethos at this point are those two things. Who exactly is taking a fucking stroll that Soldado is covering for? He's not going above and beyond, not exactly. Soldado is doing the bare minimum that every other player, even down to normally languid Dembele, does.

We can press without him, and in our best games this season, he's either played a bit part or none at all. If all he's going to bring to the table is work rate, we should be looking at offers from elsewhere.

One thing I have noticed is that ALL online newspapers are much much inferior than their real versions, not just the dreaded Daily Mail. The Guardian is as much to blame as all the others.

In the 90's, every Sunday I would buy The Observer, The Mail On Sunday and The News of The World. The Observer would provide great news editorials, the Mail some decent news editorials and interviews and the NOTW was the NOTW.

Back then the Daily Mail was of a much much higher quality than it is today. But then so were all the newspapers. The Daily Mail today is far worse - much more of a gutter newspaper tabloid - than The Sun of the 90's.

The internet is to blame for the deterioration of the newspapers. It has turned it all into that hideous non-phrase ""Click Bait"". Ten ways to lick your own arse, How to be a human being in five easy steps, Three ways that Enoch Powell liked to cook black people, etc etc etc etc.  All of it garbage and we all click it because we are addicted.

The fact that the DM copy/pastes all of it's news from other sources  is of no surprise to me, furthermore I don't blame the editors for doing it.

His policies are purely idealistic and do not work in practice; you can't just force people off benefits if the jobs aren't there. The government needs to create (or faciliate the creaton of) a market where the workers, not the jobs, are in demand **before** they can realistically say the majority of people on benefits are choosing a life of dependency. Currently this is not the case, so why are they still moving forward with the sort of policies that punish the unfortunate by reducing or cutting off their only source of income?

Maybe the aim is to use money saved on the welfare bill to fund tax cuts, to fuel growth, to create jobs which in turn will reduce the number of people relying on benefits. If that is the case, then it's a chicken and egg problem and his solution is to smash the egg in the hope that doing so will create more chickens. Yes, that's how ridiculous it is.

Think about it, whenever top players emerge at top clubs they do so in a great period of success and stability. Case in point Barcelona, they were successful 3-4 years earlier but as they started lacking trophies, they had to make big buys over the past 2 seasons.

This season Jose desperately needed trophies to ease the pressure off. We will be developing players in the future. Kurt Zouma is an example of that.

Keep going back until you get oral or topical prescription(s) that are working for you.

Second would be to review your diet and lifestyle choices, ensuring you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations. This can impact skin quality/ health, sebum production, general inflammation, and of course at this time of year or when wearing sunscreen you need the vitamin D from oily fish.

There is no such thing as a product that does not irritate or clog pores for anyone unfortunately. Look for a physical sunscreen based on zinc oxide which is naturally antimicrobial and soothing/ calming, avoid drying alcohol which further damages the skin barrier.

null,false,SleepingFish,null,null,null,"Who would your suggestion be otherwise? In times of trouble who, excluding Gerrard (if even), can be called upon to drag the team morale up. There's realistically only a few in the squad. My opinions, in no particular order:

* Kolo obviously has the experience in big matches, at big teams, and is likely a strong, upbeat personality in the changing room, but its fairly certain he won't be named captain. 

* Skrtel is one of the senior members of the squad, and 2nd longest serving (after only Gerrard(?)) but he's never really shown much leadership qualities, he's never quite bossed our defence like many might have expected, and I've only ever seen him do one interview and that was this season. Maybe behind the scenes he's a motivator, a caring shoulder able to lift spirits when the team is under performing, but personally I don't see it.

* Can has recently emerged as a contender, cool, calm, collected and will in the future control midfield. Also the examples of him calling Sturridge to celebrate with Balo at Besiktas after PenaltyGate, plus another example in the following game - although what it was has slipped my mind. - In my opinion, it's certainly too early for the captaincy to be bestowed upon him, but mark my words, he will, at some stage hold the German captaincy, (if he doesn't choose Turkey.) and if he stays long enough, then Liverpool captain too.

* Hendo is current vice captain, which in most terms means he's the next step when the current captain is removed, retired or unavailable. Hendo has captained England Under 21's, and is currently showing he is able to take on the Liverpool captaincy. But we don't see or know what affect removing Gerrard completely will have. Saying that, just because he's captained England U21's doesn't mean too much. Andre Wisdom was captain of England U21's for a while, and then Conor Coady took it from him.

* Lucas? I mean, it's possible, is he a leader, a captain, or does he go about his business on and off the field quietly? I don't know.

* Finally, Sakho, he captained France and PSG from a young age, but I don't think he quite has the grasp of English that would be needed to captain Liverpool at the moment.

* **Bonus** Off the field it is clear he is the teams main activity advocate and is basically paid at the moment to keep spirits high, and is unable to step onto a pitch due to lack of injuries. Definately a character within the squad and seems to have a great relationship with the younger members of the squad, particularly the Spanish ones. That man, José Enrique!

He isn't playing like he is worth 18 million is he? Especially if you consider he is 22. He's worth more if this continues.

Yeh it's unexpected, but that's not a good excuse for essentially giving our rights to him away, like honestly, was it really so unlikely that this young player with bags of potential would never (in your words) ever ever ever ever ever ever start playing really well? for a big club like Chelsea, it's either incompetence or the deal was already done to sell him. 

&gt;That's the thing, it's not completely out of our hands. Salah still has to agree terms with ACF, if we were to offer more money and playing time. There is a chance to keep him. It's not impossible.

Even if Salah continues this form and gets 12 goals and 4 assists or whatever, you can't help but think he still won't be a solid starter for us and he clearly wasn't happy with how little time he was getting. Then you have to take into account that Fiorentina are no small club right now, they are getting Champions league in Serie A, Salah is their Star player who will get a significant pay rise if they sign him, he's adored by the fans and the club. He's going to have not only the influence of the club he's at telling him to stay, but his own national team manager has apparently done everything he can to put Salah off Chelsea as well. Yeh it's not completely impossible, nothing is, but i'd say the chances of him coming back are so very small that's its not really worth expecting it.

&gt;The new regulations, which were quietly laid in parliament last week, have been described by social landlords as likely to lead to increased hardship and evictions.

&gt;Currently, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) calculates a claimant’s universal credit monthly. If they earn above a certain threshold in that month, their entitlement is reduced or removed. Under the new rules, the DWP will take into account earnings the claimant has made in the six months previously.

Yes, I do. Hence why I support this bill that removes *both* poppies *and* Easter lilies from government buildings, a supposedly neutral ground.

sympathetic =/= supporting.

Mhm, but I don't support anything that glorify them, which is the crux of this debate. As I've said *dozens* of times on this sub, the IRA did some awful terrible things, but they [the IRA] were inevitable due to the events of the time.

British Army have done awful things in every war they've been in, even WW2. War Crimes are present in every theater of war they have existed in.

No, only because the government protected them for 30+ years and still does. While the government actively charged IRA members with everything they *could* charge them for - murder was not one of McCreeshs charges, and I'm sure they would charge him with it if the evidence was ever there.

&gt; But you just said you were an SDLP supporter.

No, I said one of my preferences was SDLP. Also: the only time I voted was before this Raymond McCreesh controversy came about, or at least before I ever heard about it/before the media covered it.

&gt; But murder is always bad according to you.

Yep. It's not to be glorified.

&gt; Do you really think the every action of the IRA was necessary but nothing the British Army did was?

The IRA forced Britain into paying attention to the NI problem, which they largely ignored before the IRA started bombing economic targets etc. Their main objective was perhaps the wrong priority (united éire), but they aided in creating a fairer society in the end. Our shakey peace of today is better than our tiered citizenship of pre-troubles NI.

The British Army was initially welcomed by the catholic nationalists, because of how bad things got with loyalists. Then the British army started siding with the loyalists, and got heavy handed with the nationalists. So yeah, I guess not everything the British Army did was necessary, they could've been nothing more than riot police here, but alas, trained killers tend to not be good peacekeepers. Shoot to kill wasn't necessary, shooting kids in the back wasn't necessary, torture and internment of innocents, all not necessary.

&gt;  They both did awful things.

Which I've said for literally my entire existence in /r/northernireland.

&gt; Or hey maybe grow the fuck up and realise there's good and bad in both.

Maybe grow the fuck up and realise there are hundreds/thousands of victims of the British Army in this tiny spit of land we call Northern Ireland. Same with the IRA. So, a government building should remain neutral.

&gt; Well now if you're calling for them to be punished surely you should be calling for every single member of the IRA to be tried to?

I've said this literally from the start of my visits to /r/northernireland too. Seriously, go wayyy back in my post history if you want. I've repeatedly stated that every victim on both sides should get a trial, the cost should not be considered, there should be unrestricted access to all files. Rip the bandaid off if you get what I mean, air the dirty laundry. Get it over with once and for all, and then everyone can move on.

Also, the past 3 UCL winners destroyed teams that were using Tiki-taka playing style. Bayern(pre-Pep) destroyed Barcelona and Real destroyed Pep's Bayern. We also knocked out Barca with their Tiki-taka playing style with just 10 men on the pitch. It doesn't work against strong defense. Defense has always been the bread and butter for Jose Mourinho teams. And with tiki-taka, you usually have to play from the back which is quite risky against top teams. You need defenders with buccaneering style of play like David Luiz or a midfielder turned into a CB. Without brilliant goal scoring machine like Messi or really good dribblers it won't be that successful. Btw, why is any form of short quick passing considered Tiki-taka these days? Every time, i see a video depicting few brilliant passes everyone thinks it is Tiki-taka. Counter-attacking football is the best form of playing style against any top team in the world.

Indeed, it has already been suggested that the 24-year-old may this summer take over the famous No.9 shirt at Anfield. Especially as Iago Aspas, who wore it without distinction last season, moved to Sevilla on loan earlier this week.

&gt;Sturridge, though, says he is happy to leave things as they are for now.

&gt;“It’s not important,” he said. “My name is Daniel Sturridge. I’ve got 15 letters in my name, and that number 15 has been good to me. I’ve never really been obsessed with specific shirt numbers.

&gt;“When I was younger I wanted to be No.10, then No.8, but as you grow up, you don’t get to choose, you have to wait your turn.

&gt;“I suppose now I am at the stage where I can select a number, but I don’t think I will take No.9 even if it is offered to me. But you never know.”

&gt;Qinetiq was floated on the London Stock Exchange in February 2006. The company had been valued at between £1.1bn and £1.3bn, with the MoD holding estimated to be worth £616m – £728m, the Carlyle Group's holding £341m – £403m, and staff/management's holding worth £143m – £169m. Controversy was generated by the very large returns for the Carlyle Group and senior managers, with figures of over £20m suggested in the media for Sir John Chisholm.

&gt;Controversy also arose around the fact that retail investors were excluded from the initial public offering (IPO) due to Qinetiq's complexity and that institutional investors would require less complicated marketing and financing. This led to contrasts with the 'Sid' campaign for British Gas plc in 1986, where retail investors were encouraged to buy shares, with discounts and a large advertising campaign. The issue was partially resolved by allowing some brokerage firms to place orders in the IPO as part of a combined order, allowing the firm to purchase as though an institutional investor but on behalf of clients. While this did not result in a public campaign or retail investor discounts, it did allow many investors to purchase shares. The company floated on 10 February 2006, with an IPO of 200p per share, which gave a market value of £1.3bn. On 13 February 2006 (the Monday after the Friday IPO) shares closed at 219.5p, valuing the company at over £1.4bn.

and finally... The icing, the cherry, the whole fucking patisserie on the cake...

&gt;In 2007, the National Audit Office conducted an inquiry into the privatisation to determine whether UK taxpayers got good value for money. The inquiry looked at the following issues:

&gt; * choice of privatisation strategy;

&gt; * management of the process (the split of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency into two, the sale to Carlyle and the flotation);

&gt; * costs incurred and the proceeds achieved; and

&gt; * whether the deal met its objectives.

&gt;In November 2007, the NAO reported that taxpayers could have gained ""tens of millions"" more and was ***critical of the incentive scheme given to Qinetiq managers, the 10 most senior of whom gained £107.5m on an investment of £540,000 in the company's shares. The return of 19,990% was described as ""excessive"" by the NAO.*** The role of Qinetiq's management in negotiating terms with the Carlyle Group while the private equity company was bidding for the business was also criticised by the NAO. ***Carlyle bought a third of the business for £42m, which grew in value to £372m in less than four years.***",null,0,null,1425607754,null,0,false,0,cp5u5me,null,t3_2y0psb,null,t1_cp5u5me,null,t1_cp5m50k,null,null,null,1427604379,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

The large proportion of that debt came from the cost of the part re-nationalising (bailing out) of the banks. Then there is the automatic destabilisation of the budget that occurs in a recession, which is; more people end up unemployed, therefore, there's less taxable income, whilst you also have to  pay (rightly so) these people benefits whilst they look for a new job. 

Yes, I agree that Brown's fiscal policy was unsustainable and that we shouldn't spend so much during growth periods, yet, in a recession; it's important the government spends more to protect the living standards of all citizens, especially, those at the margins.

There is far too much media coverage on the importance of fiscal prudency. Providing your economy grows, your debt obligations decrease, and lets not forget the rather unique case of Japan with the highest GDP to debt ratio in the world... They are able to continue borrowing even with such a high level of debt, because they can indeed pay it back.
