I had a history of quite severe stomach ulcers and went through the NHS who managed to cock up the treatment. First was the wait for an appointment for an endoscopy, then when I got there it was very basic and a bit rough, basically a large Irish woman stuffing a tube down my throat.  After that I was supposed to be given antibiotics for the ulcer and a course of acid reducing drugs to allow the ulcers to heal.  Except they forgot the latter and they never healed properly so it was a complete waste of time.

Bupa was entirely different.  Appointment was scheduled for when I wanted it.  When I arrived, I got a room and the actual doctor came along and told me exactly what was going to happen, gave me the menu and asked if I wanted a paper.  Then they sedated me, did the thing and I woke up - to a nice chicken mayo sarnie and a copy of the Indie.  He then said they had tested for H-Pylori which was positive and would start me on the course of drugs which I was then given.  I was home by 10 and back at work half an hour later.

Starbucks sell coffee in the UK. Fine. But they bought the beans elsewhere (like Ethiopia or something). Then they flew them or shipped them to Europe (let's say France). Maybe they then used a French logistics company to drive them to stores in the UK.

Their cups are made in China, and they probably buy them and import them.

And the company is American. Branding and marketing materials likely come from there.

So ok, they make a profit on a cup of coffee. And then they pay their staff, and the business rates for the building etc - but how on earth does anybody decide exactly how much tax they should pay, or what the British portion of the profit is? I really have no idea.

The good thing about that law is that it is very broadly worded. Basically, if it looks like your arrangement is designed to reduce tax (like purchasing through an Irish company), rather than making business sense (like buying beans from Ethiopia), you can get hit with it.

If an agreement can be made to bring Pep to City a season earlier we should obviously take it though, don't get me wrong on that, but Pep is absolutely the only manager I think that should challenge Pellegrini for his position before his contract is up, sacking a manager after a title and (what is likely going to be) a 2nd place makes the board reek of impatience. 

Of course this was what happened with Mancini, but he had different problems, Pellegrini doesn't have any dressing room problems, the players all seem to love him, so his sacking would be for nothing else than underperforming, which would honestly be way too harsh.

Anyways, like others say Pep would be the absolutely best manager we could find ourselves with, the question is simply if he'd like to go to City. If he has plans on entering the PL then we're actually not a bad choice, the other top teams are unlikely to depart with their managers and it could present an extra challenge to him seeing how we've underperformed in the CL.

null,false,IAmNotAmerican,cnty-expat,I don't belong here,null,"&gt; I'm sorry but the idea that I, in a complex human society cannot harm you with speech acts is just... werid.

I can tell that no matter what I say from this point is you're not going to be convinced either way. You are not going to shift from your bias since you've decided to label any alternative view as an alien concept. However I will respond for the benefit of anyone still reading.

&gt; I can with words of mouth or pen alone turn you into a monster

There is absolutely no way that with words of your mouth or pen **alone** you can turn me into a monster, no matter how highly you think of yourself. You would have to have some kind of leverage, such as reputation gained by a national newspaper.

There's no way that you could say right now as /u/LordMondando ""Listen people of Reddit, /u/IAmNotAmerican is a kiddie-diddler."" and suddenly have the masses of the Reddit just take what you've said on face value and agree with you. Especially if you were to attempt it now in light of the existence of this thread.

Free speech at the lower levels of society works on a mutually assured destruction level. I don't go around tell lies about people because I don't want them to turn on me either socially or physically. They treat me the same way. There are a few wierdos out there who would do it, but by their very nature of being wierdos - their lack of reputation not being as such to sway the masses - they are more of an annoyance. They will find themselves socially ostracised.

&gt; And if I tell your neighbors your a pedophile,

How would I know if you had, unless my neighbours decided to attack me... then you would have an unjustified act of violence against myself - and this is what should be prosecuted.

If my neighbours approach me and ask ""are you a pedophile"" then I can answer ""No, I'm not"". If they tell me /u/LordMondando has told them, then I would warn them that /u/LordMondando is a liar and not to trust what he says... See how free speech works? You slander me, I ""slander"" you, the truth will bear out over time and eventually people will ignore you as you get classified as a liar - probably because you've done the same to them.

&gt; or repeatedly email your boss with forged screen shots of you posting on Nazi forums?

Well that would fall under harassment law, free speech doesn't need to come into it. In actual fact, if you began a campaign of spreading rumours about me with all my neighbours that would also be a trigger for harassment.

&gt; I'm sorry mate, how have you not just had to bite the bullet and concede that speech acts can harm you?

I have suggested a way society could work without slander and libel laws. In fact where I'm from people don't sue you for slander or libel - they beat the shit out of you instead. That's the dark truth of how society actually works, and why police are there to uphold law and order, not necessarily side with the innocent. Ergo why they are sometimes brought in to protect the guilty from the 'innocent'.

When it comes to advertising, the *act* of telling me your product will reduce hair loss does not harm me. The financial act of me buying your product based on a lie harms me... therefore you are not responsible for the advertising (which in actual fact is also regulated by a **non-government** organisation in the UK - proving my point) but you are responsible for the *act* of selling something based on a lie - also covered by tons of consumer law.

I'm not making this up - this is actually how advertising and consumerism works right now... Bro, do you even UK?

However, that said, I'd have no problem with limiting such *non-free* or *for-profit* speech... that is speech which is tied to a business, speech that is generated in order to make a profit.... Which brings us nicely back to the national newspaper example, because I know as soon as you read that you wouldn't be able to resist trying to use it as a counter-example - it's why I offered it up. A newspaper is not offering free-speech, it's offering for-profit speech.

You seem to have plenty of great replies already about the local area so I'll try and help a little with the question in regards to your wife.  I moved to Cambridge from another part of the UK ~6 years ago and am currently working for the NHS.

Any nurse in the UK must be registered with the NMC (Nursing and Midwifery Council) before being able to practice.  As she trained and qualified abroad, she will need to apply for admission onto the register which unfortunately includes taking two exams to prove competence as well as costing a fair chunk.  [Here's the page with the info she needs to register!](http://www.nmc-uk.org/registration/joining-the-register/trained-outside-the-eu--eea/)

[Addenbrooke's Hospital](http://www.cuh.org.uk/corporate-information/about-us) is the main hospital in Cambridge.  It's huge... the campus is like a town within itself.  There are many different specialities - and many [nursing jobs available.](http://jobs.cuh.org.uk/job_list/s1/Nursing_midwifery?_ts=1)

The 'Band 5, 6, 7' that is listed on the jobs page refers to the NHS pay scale. You start on the bottom rung of the band ladder and (generally) go up a step each year.  A registered staff nurse would start at Band 5 (£21,478) and increase each year until the maximum (£27,901).  Band 6 (£25,783-£34,530) would be a Charge Nurse - higher pay but more responsibility and experience required! 

Addenbrookes is a great place, but it's extremely busy and sadly understaffed which puts a lot of pressure on employees.  There are other smaller hospitals locally (private and NHS) that are probably a bit more laid back if that's more her thing.

null,false,notbeforelong,null,null,null,"I know I'm late to the ""party"" but what the heck, I just got over he disappointment. 

I was more disappointed by the team than the loss. It's crazy how nervous our team looked and how daft Pellegrini is with his tactics. 

Our back four and midfield were in shambles and were cut open time and time again. Some people have said its the high line we play and I agree. Our players do not fit the system and Pellegrini has to change it. He doesn't have an open cheque book like Hughes or Mancini. He has to work with the players currently in the team. If the players can't adapt to pellegrini's formation then it's high time he took a second look. 

Our formation on Sunday was a 4-4-2 with the two widest midfielders playing on their ""weaker sides"" meaning they will tend to drift in more often. Liverpool were playing a wide 3-4-3 somewhat and had their midfielders out wide and two widest forwards occupying the wings as well. I feel if Navas and Milner/Kolarov were occupying our wings we would have done a lot better. An extra man in midfield would have helped too. 

I've said this before and I'll say it again. Under Pellegrini, our players don't look like they're playing with any fire in their bellies. Most of them are comfortable knowing that they have places in the squad. Milner surpassed the rest of the team in terms of performance because the other players' ""comfortable"" performances were outshone by Milner, plus he was fighting for a place in the squad.

I think this loss was down to our team mentality and tactics this match. Hopefully we can pick up the slack against Leicester and Burnley and solve our shit before barca. 

If we win against barca then all this will be forgotten but there were signs of this last year and this year they haven't been resolved. 

On a side note, why doesn't Pellegrini try something like why Mancini did with NDJ (playing between midfield and defense), Barry and Yaya.

&gt; Anything one buys from oneself should be treated as profit, and not a legitimate business expense.
&gt; 
&gt; If they want to deduct the cost of coffee beans as a business expense, they can buy them on the open market, from a 3rd party independent supplier.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't see why this is so hard.

So what you're banning is vertical integration in any and all businesses.

JCB - a major British manufacturing firm for instance, would have to close down it's Cab Systems and Powertrain divisions, because the Heavy Products division for instance would be banned from internally buying cabs or engines from those separate divisions of JCB (and they *are* separate - Power Systems and Drive Trains sell engines and drivetrains to all sorts of 3rd party OEMs).

Or Hotel Chocolat would be banned from buying the cocoa it grows on it's own ethically run Caribbean plantations, because you know, internal buying is bad - they have to go down to the slave-wage plantation down the road which constitutes the ""open market"".

Likewise in your mechanic example, let's say your company had the workshop business, and then a separate sales desk where customers could buy their own oil from your customer-sales business. In banning internal sales, the workshop side of your business would be barred from buying from yourself - you'd have to go down to another supplier and buy in oil *separately* rather than doing what is effectively a stock transfer (and shuffling wooden dollars).

If you wanted to set up a subsidiary that you buy consumables from at a marked up price, then yeah you could absolutely do that - of course assuming they were both in the UK, then you'll just get hit for the tax on the profit the subsidiary makes.

If you don't see a minor issue with banning any and all vertical integration then you haven't thought this through in depth.",null,0,null,1425374671,null,0,1425377498,0,cp2s95w,null,t3_2xoegm,null,t1_cp2s95w,null,t1_cp2oy1g,null,null,null,1427552159,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

What we should be doing is having the government substantially invest in the north to kick start their local economy. This has already been done to some extent with varying degrees of success, but the main thing is to pool resources in a relatively concentrated area (the Manchester-Leeds metro) and Cardiff-Bristol-Bath in the west as the economy will grow from creating a virtuous cycle ie: attracting skilled people who innovate, bring in higher tax receipts (more spending) that create businesses which then brings in even more skilled people. The reason the area is [comparatively poorer](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/09/revealed-wealth-gap-oecd-report) is due to bad government policy (Thatcher years) as they shut down entire industries overnight under without retraining the displaced workers. Remember, the economy can expand as long as we have an excess of human capital (which we do) - so London's loss is not necessarily the north's gain. They can both simultaneously expand.

For example, in my home town in Wales, the local council built a high tech research centre, offering low taxes and multiple incentives. As a result, hundreds of well paid people moved here and thousands of new jobs have also been indirectly created. This was only one project (they have 6 more in the pipeline, including a tidal lagoon) but it had a remarkable effect on my town in just 5 years.

I was about to say that clearly there's no problem with JCB Heavy Products buying a powertrain from JCB Powertrains, and you're just being silly, because JCB is taxed the same on the profits if they're earned by one division as they are if they're earned by another. Then I realised that this becomes a problem if JCB have one factory in the UK and another in France.

But you know what else I realised? I don't give a fuck. Tax them.

It's not the government's job to ensure you make a profit, and it's not the government's job to prop up the economy.

It's the government's job to ensure tax is collected fairly.

Fairness and equality are the founding principles of government, and they are usurped when rich people are allowed to offshore their tax obligations. 

I'm pretty sure JCB will find a way to deal with it, and if they don't then good riddance to them. 

Hotel Chocolat can quite legitimately grow cocoa on their organic plantations, and they can encourage other companies to buy it and make candy bars out of it. That's called marketing and it's part of entrepreneurism.

It's pretty blurry. There are some bits which are the personal property of the Queen. Even under a republican regime she would retain them. You can't just go snatching people's property from them! No one has made a habit of that sort of behaviour since the Bolsheviks shot the Tsar and his family.

The Crown Estates are grey. Whether they would be entirely nationalised, or whether there would be some split - the government taking the major palaces and estate, the Windsor family retaining a few residential properties such as Clarence House or whatnot. Who knows?

And that's the thing - no one *knows* - our constitutional law dictates a Monarchy. In order to get to a Republic you need to tear up the all the constitutional law and start over, so basically *everything* is on the table. There is no guidance in law as to what would happen, because you'd be *tearing up* the relevant law and replacing it entirely - back to and including Magna Carta!

Since popular support for the Monarchy is reasonably high at the moment, people positing the question are generally hypothesising what *they* would like to see. If we actually came to a point where public dis-satisfaction had grown to such a point we decided to abolish the Monarchy, we'd be in a very different Britain, and probably have a very different government in place so it's difficult to gauge how far the political and public mood would cause reclamation to go.",null,0,null,1425378610,null,0,false,0,cp2t1c4,null,t3_2xoahi,null,t1_cp2t1c4,null,t1_cp2scw1,null,null,null,1427552524,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

We guess it's expanding based on redshift which can be caused in a few different ways, there is more mass than scientists account for in the galaxies boom we shall invent dark matter, the red shift is stronger than the big bang predicts boom we shall invent dark energy to fix that flaw.

There is really not a lot of proof for it and as more things come up to disprove it such as the CMB cold spot which is also against the big bang  theory more things are conveniently invented to keep it alive.

I don't think you really understand how business works outside of small one-man band shops.

What you're proposing is to effectively tax turnover, not profit. Which is fucking stupid.

Let's say the government considers every part of a heavy excavator to be taxable, then that means they're going to stuff 20% on the price of the engine, 20% on the price of the drivetrain, 20% on the value of the cab at the point where Heavy Products buys them internally from the other divisions.

JCB would be paying that *before* they've sold the machine. And they'll have to stuff 20% VAT on the final product as well.

Any machine built in Britain will suddenly become 20+% more expensive, which means it will be totally uncompetitive against machines from America or Europe.

JCB will either go bust, or - more likely - they will find ""a way to deal with it"" - which is to up sticks and move it's entire manufacturing base to America and India (where it already has sites).

Likewise, Caterpillar will close it's Desford plant and move it out to the continent.

Toyota will close it's Derby plant and move to the continent.

And so will Terex, Aston Martin, Jaguar-Land Rover, Rolls Royce (cars), Rolls Royce (turbines), Nissan, Vauxhall, etc.

You're looking at emptying the country of any major manufacturing and making millions of people redundant - because *absolutely every major employer* has some level of vertical integration.

And then it's not even manufacturing - you're talking about the price at which Microsoft licenses Windows and Office internally to their Microsoft UK sites. Software, services - even the service industry has vertical integration for service support. If marketing want new computers they may have to shuffle wooden dollars out of their budget into IT's budget for IT to go and get their new hardware. You're proposing to make those wooden dollars taxable!

&gt; **Hotel Chocolat can quite legitimately grow cocoa on their organic plantations, and they can encourage other companies to buy it and make candy bars out of it. That's called marketing and it's part of entrepreneurism.**

But you would ban them from using their own cocoa in their own chocolate? They would have to sell their own cocoa out of the company and buy in cocoa for the chocolate business? That's retarded.

&gt; **It's not the government's job to ensure you make a profit,**

No, but if you want to treat turnover as profit and tax it, then you are making it *impossible* to make a profit.

&gt; **and it's not the government's job to prop up the economy.**

Well, actually, what else does the government exist for if not to look out for the welfare of the population? That sometimes involves regulating markets (such as utilities) to ensure monopolies and duopolies do not act against the public interest.

Sometimes it's ensuring that banks do not fold, and cost 5 million people their pensions, or guaranteeing savings to a point (£75k at the moment). Sometimes it involves extending a loan to ensure a company doesn't fold and lay off 100k employees who are all going to start defaulting on their mortgages or claiming JSA and Housing benefits.

**Cut the rhetoric - what is your actual proposal?**

At the end of the day, how do you *actually propose* that the government tax Amazon?

You can't just say ""tax them!"". I mean, how do you propose to *actually do it*?
They make no ""profit"" in the UK, because all business is done in Luxembourg. So are you going to tax them on sales, charge them £1 on every transaction, tax their turnover? On what?

Utter bullshit, observational evidence =/= blind faith

&gt;  there is no way we as humans at this stage in our development can do more than take guesses and we can't see or travel far enough to take good ones.

Again, with no understand of what the observational evidence is or the many different methods etc we use to understand the evolution of the Universe, how can you make a statement like that?

&gt; We guess it's expanding based on redshift which can be caused in a few different ways, there is more mass than scientists account for in the galaxies boom we shall invent dark matter, the red shift is stronger than the big bang predicts boom we shall invent dark energy to fix that flaw.

Again, you're taking a GCSE understanding of the science and assuming that that's all scientists work on. Pop-science is great for basic understanding of the broad concepts, but you're assuming it's valid to use it to understand the details which is clearly useless.

&gt;There is really not a lot of proof for it and as more things come up to disprove it such as the CMB cold spot which is also against the big bang theory more things are conveniently invented to keep it alive.

There's loads of proof, and the ""CMB cold spot"" doesn't disprove anything, it just shows that (unsurprisingly) our models aren't perfect yet and is an interesting area of study. Nothing is ""conveniently invented"", the model is improved, which is standard science practice.

&gt;I'm really saying we will never know it's all someones faith, it may be right it may be ridiculously wrong I don't believe humans will last long enough to find out.

No. Faith is believing something without evidence, science is seeing what the evidence suggests is true. They're polar opposites.

&gt; I'm personally inclined to go with the Big Bang Theory until there is something better but I think it asks a hell of a lot to believe in the magical start and the early universe expanding faster than physics actually allows for, which scientists just don't talk about much.

There's no ""magical start"", we don't actually understand *what* the beginning was. Our models don't actually work until a tiny fraction of a second after, before that is still largely speculation. Again, you're assuming scientists work on your pop-sci knowledge and assuming that there's been no simplification. The early universe didn't expand faster than physics allows for, because the expansion of the Universe isn't the same thing as movement, again you have a poor understanding of the detailed concepts and are trying to argue without actually knowing what you're talking about.

tl;dr: go away, get an A-level in physics, then go do a degree in astrophysics, or at least physics, actually read some papers on the subject rather than articles on Wikipedia or whatever, and *then* come back.

You mean you don't like testable models? What an odd statement. Dark matter is a model which has proven itself above others. Dark energy is simply a label.

Whether or not you expect a cold spot depends on your cosmology, there are other big bang cosmologies other than the standard model. A universe without a big bang doesn't explain the uniformity of the CMB or other measurements.

null,false,forgottoflush,eng-Bristol,County of Bristol,null,"Workers who live in London have suffered a worse wage squeeze than those in any other UK region since the crash, even as the capital’s economy seems to have rebounded more strongly than the rest of the country.
While Londoners still enjoy much higher salaries than the UK average, official data analysed by the Financial Times suggest the pay gap has narrowed since the financial crisis, soothing some of the concerns that London is running away from the rest of the country.

Annual pay rose just 2.5 per cent in cash terms between April 2008 and April 2014 for the median worker who lives in London, compared with 5.9 per cent for the median UK worker and 9.9 per cent for the median worker in the North East.

These trends have reduced the pay disparities between the richest and poorest regions, although they are still large. Economists see the weaker wage growth as evidence that London has a flexible workforce that has accepted lower real wages in order to win jobs or hold on to them.

The FT analysed data from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, which is based on a 1 per cent sample of employee jobs taken from HM Revenue &amp; Customs’ PAYE records. The FT also examined wage data from the Labour Force Survey and found the same pattern.

Londoners’ wages have been particularly weak since 2012, coinciding with a period of very rapid employment growth in the capital.

Tony Travers, a professor at the London School of Economics, said London’s pattern of weak wage growth and strong job creation looked like a more extreme version of the trends that have characterised the UK labour market as a whole since the crisis.

After accounting for inflation, average UK wages have plunged about 8 per cent — and have only just started to turn the corner — while the employment rate is flirting with a record high.

“If the story of the last five or six years has been one of flexibility in the economy, accommodating radical changes because of the recession, then you would expect that to show up in London most,” Prof Travers said. “London does have the biggest private sector economy of any region in the country, so it’s likely to be the least unionised, the most flexible.”

London is also a relatively young city, with a median age of 34 compared with the UK average of almost 40. Young workers have had sharper real wage falls than older ones. The Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank calculates that median pay for those aged 22-29 was still 9 per cent lower in 2014 than in 2008, while median pay for those aged 60 and over had already recovered its pre-crisis level.

London pay growth has been slightly stronger when workers are analysed by their place of work, rather than where they live. On this basis, median annual pay rose 3.7 per cent compared with the UK average of 5.9 per cent. This suggests commuters into London have not been as squeezed as workers who live in the capital.

Paul Bivand, associate director of statistics at the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion think-tank, said there had been strong growth in low-paid jobs in London such as food preparation, hospitality and cleaning, as well as big increases in well-paid jobs such as managers and senior officials. He said the average earnings of higher-paid groups appeared to be slipping, though, because lower-paid people were moving into those roles.

“Even high-end jobs haven’t been increasing in pay because they are expanding through less experienced or lower-paid people coming in,” he said.

null,false,Hemmers,null,null,null,"&gt; Doesn't Parliament already have the ability to depose the Monarch (or at least demand her abdication) and appoint a new one (so not necessarily the heir)?

I don't know. Certainly they can apply pressure for a monarch to abdicate (and of course a Monarch could name a successor who was not the direct heir). Not sure whether they have the power to appoint the new Monarch however, especially if that person is arbitrarily selected or elected (i.e. entirely outside the line of succession - not just skipping Charles to get to William or something).

You'd be effectively abolishing the current Royals and installing new Royals. So no less constitutionally significant than abolishing altogether.

&gt; In that case, we could just vote in a president, and give them the title of Monarch for constitutional purposes - just like how the Prime Minister is always First Lord of the Treasury.

No, the Monarch chooses to appoint the PM as 1st Lord. They don't *have* to - they just always do. The monarch can do that - it only affects the UK.
The problem with the monarchy is it extends beyond our shores into other sovereign nations, so having the UK Gov making a substantial change to the Monarchy (that isn't simply abolishing it) is deeply problematic.

So there are two things:

1. Deposing the Monarch and installing a President within the Royal constitutional framework would create a constitutional crisis equivalent to abolishing the Monarchy entirely - and it would be a crisis you would have to repeat every election when you depose the latest ""Monarch"" in favour of the next one. Pragmatically you'd just abolish the Monarchy and install a President, and go through the pain (once!) of dealing with the Crown Estates, Royal Collection and other related properties.

2. The Commonwealth. The Monarch is King/Queen of many Commonwealth nations. Canada, NZ and Aus all have Prime Ministers, just like the UK. The Queen is their head of state (even if it's ceremonial and they have autonomy).

If we abolish the Monarchy in Britain and elect a President, it would be up to other countries whether they continue to recognise the Queen as their official (albeit ceremonial) Head of State, or elect their own Presidents as well. That's fine - we're only affecting ourselves, although it would most likely trigger Republican changes in many Commonwealth nations.

What we *cannot* do however, is to install the British President as Monarch - because that would require the assent of the Commonwealth - our elected President would become the Head of State of those various other countries!

Can you imagine Canada or New Zealand's reaction to being told their new Head of State is President Blair because the British people have said so?",null,0,null,1425380511,null,0,1425383257,0,cp2tenq,null,t3_2xoahi,null,t1_cp2tenq,null,t1_cp2t632,null,null,null,1427552697,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

If I wanted to I could go on Google and find dozens of examples of the big bang theory being changed to accommodate and fix new flaws with it, I really don't have a problem with this until people start inventing made up things there is no evidence for, their creation was solely to make the big bang model work, they could exist possibly but shouldn't we discover that first before using them to fix our maths that doesn't make the theory wrong but perhaps it does stop us from looking in the right places for other solutions.

Yes when you look only at income tax, the one tax we have that is truly progressive, the rich pay a lot. But that's because they earn such huge wages in the first place. The quote from the bottom of your article points this out:

&gt; Today’s figures show that the share of post-tax income of the top one per cent rose from 8.3 per cent to 9.4 per cent between 2012/13 and 2014/15 after the Tories cut the top rate of tax. Over the same period, the bottom 90 per cent have seen their share of post-tax income actually fall, from 71.3 per cent to 70.8 per cent. The Tories have raised taxes on working people while giving millionaires a huge tax cut.

Of course the actual super-rich don't pay income tax at all, they aren't earning a wage so aren't counted as ""earners"", instead they're collecting profits and paying capital gains tax, if they aren't managing to avoid or evade tax entirely.",null,0,null,1425380820,null,0,false,0,cp2tgsn,null,t3_2xoegm,null,t1_cp2tgsn,null,t1_cp2t2vs,null,null,null,1427552725,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

I agree with you that it may seem silly to market electronics with life expectancy. White goods are certainly the priority.

It may seem pointless but knowing whether a laptop will last 3 years or 5 years can be important. Consider if you're a business and looking to bulk buy 100 for the next 5 years? Is this information important to you then? If you want a phone for the next 3 years, I'm betting some of the cheaper ones won't even last 2 years but how would you know for sure?. Information is power and we lose nothing by having it available to us.

All manufacturers know how long their devices will last for, within a decent margin of error. It's a fundamental part of the engineering process.

As you say, the Greens - whilst I like some of their policies and their approach to internal democratic governance, they are stymied by radicals. We need a party that is more logical and evidence based, that speaks to the future of humanity rather than the past.

To be honest even the name ""Green party"" is not great; we need more than just a focus on the environment - that should be fundamental to any forward thinking party, yes, but when people hear 'green' there's a tendency to taint it with green-at-all-costs, and I think - especially the older generation - equates this with somehow green at the expense of the economy.

Paradox 1.) is that to have absolutely free speech with no limitations would actually result in less speech. The problem is the line between what counts as speech and what counts as an action. Under the absolutist approach, you eventually have to concede that this distinction, while crucial, is near impossible. In the absence of a clear distinction between speech and action, the result would be that anything goes, and, if this is the social environment, people (maybe not everyone but at least some) would likely be too afraid to exercise their rights.

Paradox 2.) is that some restrictions on speech actually enable more speech and in ways that are currently deemed appropriate. Hate speech is commonly and misleadingly associated with what is merely 'offensive,' which in turn is commonly taken to imply that it is a sort of 'thought policing' i.e. equated with an inability to speak to certain beliefs. Hate speech is about regulating the boundaries between certain kinds of speech which are more likely than not, in a given context, result in obviously undesirable actions taking place. 

The reality is that what hate speech protects against are very standard crimes related to public order and assault. The aim is prevent a defendant invoking their right to freedom of expression in such a categorical fashion that it winds up trumping the State's interest in maintaining order and upholding the rights of citizens not to be harassed, threatened or assaulted. The aim is to allow for constructive deliberation over controversial issues with the availability of a sanction for the possibility of things getting out of hand. 

In light of the difficulties in setting hard and fast rules definition across all manner of speech/action in all sorts of contexts, the only sensible [theoretical guide](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/zenger/freespeech.htm) is that free speech must be a balancing exercise, and not one of thickly drawn black lines or absolutes. The presumption in any case of regulating ""speech"" is always strongly in the favour of the freedom (i.e. of the speech not being regulated; there has to be a very strong case for it to be restricted).

The biggest problem is that too many ideas for “improving” the North have revolved around “improving the North as a place for people based in London to get unglamorous stuff done cheaply where they don't have to look at it”. While a bunch of back-office civil service jobs have been moved out to regional centres to patch up employment there, that actually makes those towns *more* dependent on central government hand-outs for funding and doesn't really build a local economy. Move some actual government departments, there's no good reason for them all to be clustered around Whitehall and Victoria Street. 

Moving BBC production to Salford Quays has created an actual economic centre there, value is added and success attracts more businesses. So, more of that kind of thing.

The north has historically been the powerhouse of the British economy and there is no reason why it can't be. There have been so many innovators, entrepreneurs and great thinkers from the North (and Scotland) and there still are.

The difference is that due to the way cards have fallen in recent decades, London has become the hub for a a number of the worlds leading industries, and has become a magnet for the worlds talent.

What people tend to forget is that a huge number of British Londoners are first/second generation and have moved there from the North, and a great many of them tend to be extremely successful. You can see this by looking at the people at the top of almost every industry. 

In terms of physical location, yes sure, there may be a north/south divide, but in terms of personal success, I think the data is much less divided. 
 
Industrial Britain came to a crashing end under Wilson, with then the last bit finished off under Thatcher - coupled with the Big Bang in global finance happening in London, there was a clear divergence in fortune, and there would never be a clean transition.

I can't think of anything that could have immediately replaced the pits etc. 

We are in a different world now, with the internet opening up to a global market, and globalisation meaning that certain industries will perpetually shift around the world on a cost basis.

The UKs main benefit is our intellectual input, and this come from people, not locations. 

Manchester has had some 20 odd Nobel prize winners, so it seems like a fantastic place to make a canary wharf of the north. Slash business rates for tech businesses and watch them pile in and transform the city. 

Places like Liverpool or the North East could benefit from similar deregulation in industries like engineering too.

Like Sway, [I don't have the answers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEhGhJw9TBg), but I think it is mad to write off the north in any way whatsoever.

I also think the North will always struggle so long as it keeps on voting Labour. The Tories, or UKIP are probably not the answer either, so maybe a new Northern centre right party with sensible views on the economy is needed before we see big progress.

I think Giddeons plans to deregulate the north is broadly a huge positive.

1. Howard is starting every game because Martinez considers him the best goalkeeper at the club, he may well be out of form but he needs to get back to top form where he is light years better than Robles, whether playing though it or having a break is best to get back to form is debatable, but Martinez clearly thinks playing through it is best for Tim


2. Browning hasn't played presumably because he isn't ready, Martinez clearly has nothing against giving people their chance, Stones/Barkley/Garbutt so it must simply be a case of Browning isn't quite there yet


3. Barkley is played out on the wing because there isn't always a space for him in the team, in my opinion Naimsith has a much bigger impact on the game at the moment so I would much rather have him in his preferred position, which leave Barkley out on the wing or on the bench 


4. With regards to possession vs counter attack, it's more of a case of confidence/no confidence, it's clear to see that we are playing without confidence which we need for possession football to work, people making runs wanting the ball, people not scared to play the key passes etc. it worked absolutely fine last year so it's not the system (people say that other managers have cottoned on to Martinez's system, but anyone who thinks that every manager in the premiership didn't know we would play possession after 5 games last season, if not before, is deluded imo)

There is nothing new in this report.

The only recent evidence that they present is comparing unemployment rates and wages with immigration per county, and does not take into account many important factors such as the number of zero hour contracts, the fact that people work between counties, and illegal immigration.

How long should the battery be able to hold a certain percentage of it's total charge for (i.e. in 5 years time it'll hold 80% of rated capacity), how long should the HDD be good for, heat pipe life span when it comes to the cooling system.  That sort of thing.

**Southampton:**

Centre-back Toby Alderweireld could return to the Saints side after missing the last seven games with a hamstring injury.

Their only other injuries are long-term casualties Jay Rodriguez and Emmanuel Mayuka, although Graziano Pelle is under pressure after failing to find the net since the sides last played in the FA Cup fourth round in January.


**Crystal Palace:**

Only in the assumption that it is simply a standard fluctuation. It's a 3-4 sigma deviation from LambdaCDM, which gives it a probability of randomly forming somewhere between 1 in 400 to 1 in 16000. However that's only the simplest models, there are secondary effects on the CMB.

As I pointed out this is LambdaCDM not the big bang, there are many non-standard cosmologies that still have a hot big bang. This criticism of LamdbaCDM isn't a criticism of the big bang. You claim dark matter is an issue and yet many static cosmologies required it to some extent. Dark matter is not an issue specific to the big bang.

&gt;I still believe a lot of it has to be taken as faith

It's a testable model, it doesn't require any faith. What it requires is likelyhood tests, KS tests, statistics applied to observations. There are dozens of observational tests and standard cosmology does extremely well. LambdaCDM isn't perfect but suggesting we should retreat to a static model is trading a Mondeo for a Horse. Static cosmology is not backed by observation pure and simple.

Liverpool's been in long term decline since the end of the slave triangle.  The rise of air travel and containerisation of shipping has just made that worse.

The North in general had an economy primarily based on manufacturing, farming, coal mining and fishing.  The textile industry that was based around Manchester has gone to India, China, Bangladesh at the low end,  Turkey in the mid-end, whilst France and Italy have managed to retain the high end.

Manufacturing with a few exceptions such as aerospace and  vehicles has gone to China and even Airbus and Boeing are opening factories in China.

Coal mining is 99% finished.  Fishing needs only a small percentage of the people that it used to and as a result of over fishing in previous years and pollution, the number of fish in the sea is dwindling.  Meaning that EU quotas for the legal catch are dropping.  Also Thatcher let British fishermen sell their quota allocations to other fishermen in particular the Spanish.  Meaning that some of our quota can't be fished by British fishermen.

Attempts to rebalance the economy of the North with service jobs hasn't been that successful.  At one time one million Brits had a job working in a call center, largely outside of the South East.  But of course many of those jobs have drifted to India and Eastern Europe.

The financial sector in the UK is dominated by London.  Alex Salmond used to say that Scotland could go it's own way thanks to the strength of Bank of Scotland, RBS, Scottish Widows and a number of Scottish investment funds.  He used to use the example of Iceland as a small country batting above it's weight thanks to financial services.  Well unfortunately RBS et al ended up bankrupt and required hundreds of billions of pounds of subsidies.  

To be the top in fields like finance, law, advertising, CEO etc. even construction you have to be based in London.  There's a continual brain drain from the rest of the UK to London.

New Towns strike me as the best solution (but then I've always had a Keynesian Leaning), but no one I've seen has put forward real world plans for how these would be accomplished.  Another thing that worries me is now as Europe goes further down the shitter, more people will want to move to it's great cities, London is obviously one of those, and given the numbers we've seen, it obviously has great appeal.

Companies claiming back the VAT on stuff they buy from other companies is not new - companies don't ultimately pay VAT, because they claim it back. But since strolls wants to kill off the sort of piss-taking that Starbucks have engaged in (as we all do), he seems to be suggesting that perhaps VAT on business purchases shouldn't be reclaimable. That still wouldn't get rid of people off-shoring because even if you couldn't reclaim VAT, Starbucks would be paying *Swiss* VAT/sales tax, so UK Gov still doesn't benefit.

VAT isn't the answer to the shenanigans Amazon and Starbucks engage in. It's an answer to individuals evading or avoiding income tax, but that's about it.

He doesn't seem to know what it is he's actually trying to achieve (beyond ""moar taxes"" for ""rich people"").

null,false,apple_kicks,null,null,null,"Yes if the right investment is made to create jobs and a new industry there. Both Tories and Labour have failed to do this or encourage it strongly enough.

In the past textile, pottery, steel, mining etc where huge industries which workers had employment and local businesses like shops, construction, handy men etc were able to live off those work forces pay and changing demands. Those were new big industries when they started and in high demand, but world has changed and areas should of had investment to change with it. 

Since changing world and the factory mine shut downs  there wasn't a really big replacement and local businesses shrunk due to pay cheques becoming benefits for the next generation. While living standards wasn't perfect before, the drop in prospects could have depressed the area since more money left public funds than went into it with employment.

It still needs a new big industries to thrive. Coal was energy but mines too expensive to re open and also like nuclear and fracking is controversial. Renewable has it controversies, but the research and development, construction, maintenance, IT side could see changes to develop and jobs in different areas. Nuclear is still an option in this too, with world conflicts being around oil and gas countries having your own supply even if it's small is needed. 

Lots of companies big and small need data storage and IT server/databases off site. A lot are relying more on digital technology and people with the knowledge to develop the new and upgrade the old. They are looking for cheap locations but also want easier physical access to it when it goes wrong or needs changing. Not really sure on competition for this, but building the infrastructure and government investment for this could help. It's good industry for the graduates and experience people in their 30s+, the areas rent currently are lot better and attractive for people that age wanting to get onto property ladder and start a career. Universities could modernise into IT, programming,  computer science, engineering, maintenance. Local and new businesses can now cater to new people and the younger generation having more prospects. With high speed rail all the big business in the south could easily travel up or managers travel down for meetings and business deals on its data infrastructure. The north could hold the data, which is then connected to the south where it's used or transported to the world. 

TL;DR either public or private investment in the area to replace past missing industries which use to fuel the local economy. It's very risky and expensive likely why no one has tried to the full extent.

Maybe these cases should go through regional crime squad or SOCA, conspiracy to commit child sexual offences are I believe an organized crime. These girls are being funnelled into the prostitution business The money from that will fund drug deals which hasn't really been addressed yet.

This is a character from Nottingham who was doing a similar thing in  the nineties, he was part of a firm that got young girls, quite a few in the care system (but not all of them) on the pipe, then on the game in flats in London, they supplied a huge amount of workers to the flats in the West End. The money they made from that, they funded large drug importations. One girl got caught bringing 12 keys from Jamaica, she faced 12 years (1 for each key).

Don't believe me ?  Paul Holmes was head of the Vice Squad that was responsible for North Of the Thames (based in Charring Cross) Drop him a line and ask him about Nottingham supplying girls in the early nineties

&gt;  The evidence on labour market impacts suggests these are mainly quite
modest.... The evidence to date suggests little effect on employment and
unemployment of UK-born workers, but that wages for the low paid may
be lowered as a result of migration, although again this effect is modest.

economy grows overall due to immigration, this is mainly as a result of the
increase in population. The effect of immigration on income per head – a
better measure of economic contribution – is often far smaller or zero,

suggests this may still be positive.

How is that relevant to today exactly? Is your argument really so weak? Back then, the IRA was fighting Britain ostensibly in the name of Irish people, with massive financial support from Irish and American people. Now today I can live here and experience no issues, if anything it is a positive immigrant story that you seem to want to turn in to a bad one.

&gt;I believe my attitude does help the situation as I am telling the simple truth.

If it's a simple truth, you must have simple proof that anyone who opposes immigration is a xenophobe?

&gt;And now that you are allowed in without such reservations it's odd that you then defend xenophobia...

Where did I do that? Quote please, or retract it. Why does it bother you so much to see an immigrant say that perhaps immigrants need to respect the country they are living in?

In fact, I am massive immigration rights supporter, seeing as I am an immigrant here. However I don't understand your bizarre one way attitude, where British people have to accept whatever comes in, and the immigrants don't have to accept any of British culture in return.

null,false,abc619,null,null,null,"&gt;Serious question, why should complex policy, some of which ideally should be driven by years of expertise be driven by democratic fiat.

&gt;I mean its looking a lot like a populist wish list

This is surely what modern politics is all about. You pander to specific subsets of people's populist views, they agree with those views and so vote you in. The difference is that politicians only do this for show, the reality behind the scenes is they do what they want and show just enough agreement with populist views (or worse, manipulate those views via the media and weasel worded speeches) to ensure getting voted in next time.

Modern politics is entirely about pandering to the masses, and manufacturing the consensus that agrees with their own agenda.

&gt;why should complex policy, some of which ideally should be driven by years of expertise be driven by democratic fiat. 

This is a key point for me: politicians are **not** experts in the areas they are responsible for. Ministers often move from such disparate fields as transport to foreign policy to health - the same people, in these completely different arenas. They are **not** experts in the areas they run, merely experts in managing public opinion with some element of 'I think this is what we should do'.

We NEED experts running the areas they are experts in, yet that is the opposite of what we have now!

To be ultimately cynical, crowdsourcing policies is a bad idea because peoples opinion can be manipulated, yet that is already happening now - except we only get to vote on the man who says what his opinion is and trust him at that, every four years.

Well I'll give you a little story, during a long spell of unemployment I spent a lot o time looking for work. So I discovered a lot of places were sourcing their workers from an agency, based in Poland. You could only get a foot in the door via the job agency based in Warsaw/online but all application forms in Polish and they'd only take on Polish speakers (even now, browsing job sites, they can legitimately advertise for 'Polish speaking supervisors/operatives' etc.

And working in low skilled job wih EU migrant workers- it's astounding to see how much recruitment is just done informally- they just go up to the boss and say they have a friend/relative back home who would like to come to Britain to work, can he have a job please. So the businesses stop sourcing local labour, stop advertising...why would they need to do so when the job market is casualised to this extent.

I'm not interested in JCB owning 3 different factories in the UK.

If JCB is a wholly British company then they don't need factory A to sell engines to factory B. If the two factories are owned by the same company, then Factory A can just give the engines to factory B, it doesn't affect the company's cumulative profits.

They forget, however, that they were also paying 6% on their mortgages at the same time, and are paying 1.5% now.

My view is that a lot of young people have come of financial age in a near-zero interest rate environment, and regard that as the norm. I've spoken to several of my friends who have recently bought property, and when I asked them about 5%+ interest rates, they just looked vaguely confused - ""But our interest rate is 2%.""

EDIT: Current government spending is just shy of 700B ([source](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/08/uk-benefit-welfare-spending) and yes that includes pensions). If you want it cheaper, set it to £10,000 a year at a total cost of £641B which would save money for the state.
* Gradually cut oil subsidies and pump all that money into nanotechnology, particularly solar nanotech and set subsidies for sustainable energy programs including fusion.
* With basic income people are more mobile in their employment and can afford to become entrepreneurs. Encourage this. Set programs to support people who set up their own businesses like we used to do in the 80s. This would massively boost the economy and generate new forms of work where people are able to take time to do what drives their passion, rather than community service for benefits (as the conservatives want).

Plus as the TMT sector gains a greater dominance over the market, it's possible we might see more 'satellite hubs' popping up; with technology you don't necessarily have to be right next door. But obviously you do still need to be accessible as well, so there is that tension.

null,false,TheSquareMileVampire,null,null,null,"In the original version of the film Alfie, released in 1966, you see Michael Caine ambling through the back streets of King’s Cross. The setting is all urban desolation: a London that is not swinging. In 1987, 31 people died in a blaze at the rickety train station nearby. Wooden escalators, creaking their way over flammable grease and litter, allowed the fire to spread with hideous alacrity. A decade after that, Tony Blair told an interviewer of the shame he felt when he drove his children through King’s Cross, a place still synonymous in 1997 with homelessness and prostitution.


It is now a feat of persuasion to convince a Londoner born in that year that this part of town was world famously squalid. St Pancras station gleams inside and out, its international terminal bustling with Eurostar passengers bound for Paris. Alfie’s walking route is a sleek public space lined with modern apartments and modish restaurants. Google, the Guardian newspaper and Central Saint Martins College have displaced the slums. According to Argent, the company redeveloping the area, half of its epic project is still to come. King’s Cross, like Canary Wharf before it, has become a symbol of London’s emergence as perhaps the — not just a — world city.
But it is also a symbol of London’s estrangement from the rest of Britain. From King’s Cross or St Pancras, you can catch a train to forlorn corners of the north and the Midlands that have failed to pick themselves up from deindustrialisation and not through any lack of effort. London, by galling contrast, can turn even its most Hogarthian corners into desirable places to live and work. Between 2010 and 2013, there were more cranes at work in the capital than in the rest of Britain put together.


The economic numbers, and not just the skyline, suggest a disunited kingdom. London’s output by gross value added per capita was 175 per cent of the British average in 2012. The property market of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland put together is worth about the same as the 10 priciest London boroughs combined. The worst global financial crisis since the second world war was not enough to stop London growing by 12.5 per cent between 2007 and 2011, more than twice the UK average. The rest of the country cannot keep up with King’s Cross, never mind richer districts such as Mayfair and Marylebone, which feel more like Geneva and Abu Dhabi than Terra Britannica.


There is so much demand for London that developers can afford to pick and choose who they allow into their new patch. There are no chain restaurants around Granary Square at the north end of the King’s Cross project. Argent preferred to create “texture” by giving independent businesses a foothold. Tony Travers, a professor at the London School of Economics, points out that few areas of the country can afford to discriminate like this.


And this is just the material dimension of the national disunity. Culturally, too, London unmoored from its host country long ago. It is not just by far the most diverse city in Britain but possibly the most diverse in the world and, though historians are hazy about this, plausibly the most diverse cosmopolis in history. More than a third of its population is foreign-born. The UK average is 13 per cent. White Britons are a minority in the capital, where there are more than 300 languages spoken and 50 non-indigenous groups with a population of more than 50,000 each.


London is globalisation incarnate. Its neighbourhoods, its financial sector, its restaurants, even its football clubs, have been remade by outsiders. Yet it sits in a country that sometimes seems to be turning away from global forces and the upheaval they bring. The UK Independence party, that make-the-world-go-away movement, is the electoral sensation of the day. It picks up votes across England on its anti-immigration platform, and even won the European Parliament election in May. In London, however, its performance is much less impressive. The capital tends towards Labour, though it is more liberal than strictly leftwing, which is why the cosmopolitan Conservative Boris Johnson has won two mayoral elections.


The government is trying to narrow the gap between London and the rest of Britain. But then governments always do. In the postwar decades, the heavy industries that kept northern towns going were subsidised or nationalised. In the 1980s, Michael Heseltine, a Gaullist among Tories, used his position as environment secretary to establish “development corporations” to revive Liverpool and the northeast of England. In the next decade, New Labour tried “regional development agencies”, a variation on that theme. Now George Osborne, the Conservative chancellor, hopes to “rebalance” Britain with a “northern powerhouse” by devolving funds and powers to places such as Manchester. The city is excited but expectations have been raised before.
When politicians talk of rebalancing, they really mean balancing. It is not as if the natural order of things in Britain has ever been a roughly equal spread of wealth and power across the regions. London’s preponderance is ingrained historically. It has been many times larger than the next largest city for centuries. All that has changed is the identity of the second city, with the likes of Lincoln, Norwich, Bristol and Birmingham vying for runner-up status over the past 500 years or so.



With the smart bets against other cities achieving parity, Britain should prepare for political disruption as its capital becomes a world of its own, with distinct interests and demands. This open trading city already chafes against restrictions on immigration imposed at a national level. It has more to lose from a new round of taxes on expensive properties than anywhere else in the UK. Its residents contribute disproportionately to the national exchequer, effectively subsidising other regions.


Talk of London losing its patience with all this and becoming a city-state is fanciful, but greater devolution of powers to its weak (by international standards) mayoral office seems inevitable. At the moment, Mr Johnson only has meaningful control over transport, housing and policing. National policy makers might also have to devise ways of making an exception of the capital, for example by creating a London-only work visa for migrants.


But there are two disunities at work here, not just one. If London is growing apart from Britain, different bits of London are also growing apart from each other. Economic and social patterns vary widely across the city. In King’s Cross, life expectancy is 79. In Knightsbridge, just eight stops away on the Piccadilly line, it is 91. It is as low as 75 in Lewisham, in the southeast of the city.

Ninety-seven per cent of residents in Camden borough have access to the internet. That figure is only 82 per cent in Barking and Dagenham, on the eastern fringe of the capital. Some of the poorest boroughs in the UK are in London, such as Tower Hamlets and Hackney. This was true in the mid-1990s too, so 20 years of spectacular growth have made the city richer but no more equal. And even within those boroughs lurk striking inequalities, as hipsters peer through their £200 Oliver Peoples frames at migrants eking out a living in the informal economy.


Inequality has spurred something of a reaction against modern, globalised London, and it comes as much from the liberal left as Ukip nativists. There is nostalgia for the city as it was in the 1970s: grotty but affordable. Notting Hill was rough around the edges back then. Hampstead, now a bijou village for the very rich, was home to the academic middle-class. The east end was still Cockney. Buying a house was not the Goliath task it is for young Londoners today. Some see ethical question marks over the foreign money now sloshing into the city, from Russian oligarchs, the Middle East and elsewhere.


The grievances are sometimes more aesthetic than moral: for every Londoner savouring the view of the rapidly populating skyline from Hampstead Heath or Greenwich Park, there is another cursing the proliferation of soulless glass and steel, and the new apartment blocks that jar with local architectural styles.
However, it is tricky to push this line of argument very far without nostalgia curdling into bad history and the romanticisation of squalor. The dilapidation of the Docklands was not charming, at least for people who lived there. The neglect that allowed wooden escalators to remain operational in a major transport hub as late as 1987 was not a sign of “character” either.


If London was cheaper in the past, it was because of decline and depopulation. The city’s headcount had fallen to 6.7m by the 1980s. The fact that it recently exceeded its all-time peak of 8.6m is a mark of success, even if it cloaks some eye-watering disparities of wealth. People choose to come to London and have children here.


Inequality is hard-wired into big cities: they lure people desperate for opportunity and house those who have already made it. If anything, London has been resourceful in harnessing its riches for the wider good. Under Ken Livingstone, Mr Johnson’s predecessor, so-called Section 106 agreements obliged developers to build affordable housing, environmental facilities and the like in return for planning permission. It is redistribution by other means.
And growth has brought infrastructure. London’s transport network is among the most extensive in the world, and keeps reaching into new domains such as Crossrail, the high-speed underground line that is Europe’s biggest construction project.

And yet the twin reactions against London — from a country left behind and from romantics inside the city walls — cannot be discounted. No single thing can kill London’s primacy as the hub of globalisation but the gradual build-up of bad strategic decisions (or non-decisions) can erode it over time. A foreign worker not allowed into Britain’s capital can take his talents to New York or Singapore. If Heathrow airport is not permitted to expand, the likes of Amsterdam and Frankfurt are well placed to become Europe’s aviation centre. Heavier taxes and regulations can discourage globe-trotting investors from committing their spare cash here.


London stirred from its postwar slump, with its regimented skyline and fraying neighbourhoods, by opening up to the world. Whether it will remain so open — or be allowed to by political forces elsewhere in the land — is one of the central questions of the general election in May, and one that liberals in the old sense must hope is answered in the affirmative.

 &gt;     telling them the earth is only 2000 years old

&gt;You find that in American fundamentalist schools, not in Britain

&gt;     denying large portions of history that they don't agree with

GBI simply ensures that people can afford to shelter, clothe and feed themselves first - and if people can have that basic sense of self respect it can start the ball rolling on wider social changes. More to the point, people would still have to work hard and aim to get better jobs if they had any aspirations at all-something a good starting point such as gbi encourages them to do.

You will always have to deal with in individuals who have no interest or even ability to take part in working, but they weren't very likely to bring hmrc revenue in the first place. Those that gain a better sense of their value to society by having a basic income that won't vanish at any given moment could however start to contribute more.

null,false,Leetenghui,null,null,null,"Hmm the thread has gone all over the place so... I'm going to take a stab with housing benefit.

Housing benefit itself creates a price floor, back in the 1990s we lived in shitty flats which we paid shitty rent for housing benefit created a price floor so all shitty flats were worth at least X. Except housing benefit itself is a symptom. In that we have laws force people to live in set places and buildings or dwellings. For instance I am not free to go build myself a shanty town. 

The fact I am not free to build myself a corrugated iron shanty means I have to make £X amount of money to be able to afford to live in the accepted designated areas. The UK is strange in that it is one of the few developed countries without shanties. I see them in every country I go to. The US, Canada, Hong Kong, Tokyo, S Korea, Taiwan etc.

Imagine if it were I have absolutely no money or I work a really poorly paid job of £1/h. I would go live in a shanty or a tent. Yet the government doesn't let me do this. Therefore internally in my head I make a calculation I need £x to be able to live in government approved housing. 

It makes no sense for me to take that £1/h job or £5 or even £6.50 job when there is a floor set by seemingly un-related laws which mean those jobs are not feasible for me to take as I would have nothing to pay the rent. 

This happens all over the place. In terms of running businesses. Which sets barriers to entry and price floors as government business rates have to be considered.



In terms of this thread or so I've gathered (I've not been following it too closely) they want to cut housing benefit extrapolated to zero. Yet they still want to keep the land control laws tight therefore giving people no options and or trapping them in a situation where they are subject to the law of rent whereby they have no excess in which to better their situation say save money to study or buy assets to run a business.",null,0,null,1425389813,null,0,false,0,cp2vt5b,null,t3_2xrm68,null,t1_cp2vt5b,null,t1_cp2upns,null,null,null,1427553817,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

The article

In the original version of the film Alfie, released in 1966, you see Michael Caine ambling through the back streets of King’s Cross. The setting is all urban desolation: a London that is not swinging. In 1987, 31 people died in a blaze at the rickety train station nearby. Wooden escalators, creaking their way over flammable grease and litter, allowed the fire to spread with hideous alacrity. A decade after that, Tony Blair told an interviewer of the shame he felt when he drove his children through King’s Cross, a place still synonymous in 1997 with homelessness and prostitution.
It is now a feat of persuasion to convince a Londoner born in that year that this part of town was world famously squalid. St Pancras station gleams inside and out, its international terminal bustling with Eurostar passengers bound for Paris. Alfie’s walking route is a sleek public space lined with modern apartments and modish restaurants. Google, the Guardian newspaper and Central Saint Martins College have displaced the slums. According to Argent, the company redeveloping the area, half of its epic project is still to come. King’s Cross, like Canary Wharf before it, has become a symbol of London’s emergence as perhaps the — not just a — world city. But it is also a symbol of London’s estrangement from the rest of Britain. From King’s Cross or St Pancras, you can catch a train to forlorn corners of the north and the Midlands that have failed to pick themselves up from deindustrialisation and not through any lack of effort. London, by galling contrast, can turn even its most Hogarthian corners into desirable places to live and work. Between 2010 and 2013, there were more cranes at work in the capital than in the rest of Britain put together.
The economic numbers, and not just the skyline, suggest a disunited kingdom. London’s output by gross value added per capita was 175 per cent of the British average in 2012. The property market of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland put together is worth about the same as the 10 priciest London boroughs combined. The worst global financial crisis since the second world war was not enough to stop London growing by 12.5 per cent between 2007 and 2011, more than twice the UK average. The rest of the country cannot keep up with King’s Cross, never mind richer districts such as Mayfair and Marylebone, which feel more like Geneva and Abu Dhabi than Terra Britannica.
There is so much demand for London that developers can afford to pick and choose who they allow into their new patch. There are no chain restaurants around Granary Square at the north end of the King’s Cross project. Argent preferred to create “texture” by giving independent businesses a foothold. Tony Travers, a professor at the London School of Economics, points out that few areas of the country can afford to discriminate like this.
And this is just the material dimension of the national disunity. Culturally, too, London unmoored from its host country long ago. It is not just by far the most diverse city in Britain but possibly the most diverse in the world and, though historians are hazy about this, plausibly the most diverse cosmopolis in history. More than a third of its population is foreign-born. The UK average is 13 per cent. White Britons are a minority in the capital, where there are more than 300 languages spoken and 50 non-indigenous groups with a population of more than 50,000 each.
London is globalisation incarnate. Its neighbourhoods, its financial sector, its restaurants, even its football clubs, have been remade by outsiders. Yet it sits in a country that sometimes seems to be turning away from global forces and the upheaval they bring. The UK Independence party, that make-the-world-go-away movement, is the electoral sensation of the day. It picks up votes across England on its anti-immigration platform, and even won the European Parliament election in May. In London, however, its performance is much less impressive. The capital tends towards Labour, though it is more liberal than strictly leftwing, which is why the cosmopolitan Conservative Boris Johnson has won two mayoral elections.
The government is trying to narrow the gap between London and the rest of Britain. But then governments always do. In the postwar decades, the heavy industries that kept northern towns going were subsidised or nationalised. In the 1980s, Michael Heseltine, a Gaullist among Tories, used his position as environment secretary to establish “development corporations” to revive Liverpool and the northeast of England. In the next decade, New Labour tried “regional development agencies”, a variation on that theme. Now George Osborne, the Conservative chancellor, hopes to “rebalance” Britain with a “northern powerhouse” by devolving funds and powers to places such as Manchester. The city is excited but expectations have been raised before. When politicians talk of rebalancing, they really mean balancing. It is not as if the natural order of things in Britain has ever been a roughly equal spread of wealth and power across the regions. London’s preponderance is ingrained historically. It has been many times larger than the next largest city for centuries. All that has changed is the identity of the second city, with the likes of Lincoln, Norwich, Bristol and Birmingham vying for runner-up status over the past 500 years or so.
With the smart bets against other cities achieving parity, Britain should prepare for political disruption as its capital becomes a world of its own, with distinct interests and demands. This open trading city already chafes against restrictions on immigration imposed at a national level. It has more to lose from a new round of taxes on expensive properties than anywhere else in the UK. Its residents contribute disproportionately to the national exchequer, effectively subsidising other regions.
Talk of London losing its patience with all this and becoming a city-state is fanciful, but greater devolution of powers to its weak (by international standards) mayoral office seems inevitable. At the moment, Mr Johnson only has meaningful control over transport, housing and policing. National policy makers might also have to devise ways of making an exception of the capital, for example by creating a London-only work visa for migrants.
But there are two disunities at work here, not just one. If London is growing apart from Britain, different bits of London are also growing apart from each other. Economic and social patterns vary widely across the city. In King’s Cross, life expectancy is 79. In Knightsbridge, just eight stops away on the Piccadilly line, it is 91. It is as low as 75 in Lewisham, in the southeast of the city.
Ninety-seven per cent of residents in Camden borough have access to the internet. That figure is only 82 per cent in Barking and Dagenham, on the eastern fringe of the capital. Some of the poorest boroughs in the UK are in London, such as Tower Hamlets and Hackney. This was true in the mid-1990s too, so 20 years of spectacular growth have made the city richer but no more equal. And even within those boroughs lurk striking inequalities, as hipsters peer through their £200 Oliver Peoples frames at migrants eking out a living in the informal economy.
Inequality has spurred something of a reaction against modern, globalised London, and it comes as much from the liberal left as Ukip nativists. There is nostalgia for the city as it was in the 1970s: grotty but affordable. Notting Hill was rough around the edges back then. Hampstead, now a bijou village for the very rich, was home to the academic middle-class. The east end was still Cockney. Buying a house was not the Goliath task it is for young Londoners today. Some see ethical question marks over the foreign money now sloshing into the city, from Russian oligarchs, the Middle East and elsewhere.
The grievances are sometimes more aesthetic than moral: for every Londoner savouring the view of the rapidly populating skyline from Hampstead Heath or Greenwich Park, there is another cursing the proliferation of soulless glass and steel, and the new apartment blocks that jar with local architectural styles. However, it is tricky to push this line of argument very far without nostalgia curdling into bad history and the romanticisation of squalor. The dilapidation of the Docklands was not charming, at least for people who lived there. The neglect that allowed wooden escalators to remain operational in a major transport hub as late as 1987 was not a sign of “character” either.
If London was cheaper in the past, it was because of decline and depopulation. The city’s headcount had fallen to 6.7m by the 1980s. The fact that it recently exceeded its all-time peak of 8.6m is a mark of success, even if it cloaks some eye-watering disparities of wealth. People choose to come to London and have children here.
Inequality is hard-wired into big cities: they lure people desperate for opportunity and house those who have already made it. If anything, London has been resourceful in harnessing its riches for the wider good. Under Ken Livingstone, Mr Johnson’s predecessor, so-called Section 106 agreements obliged developers to build affordable housing, environmental facilities and the like in return for planning permission. It is redistribution by other means. And growth has brought infrastructure. London’s transport network is among the most extensive in the world, and keeps reaching into new domains such as Crossrail, the high-speed underground line that is Europe’s biggest construction project. London is a city of gaudy mega-wealth and severe poverty, but it is also a city of free museums and world-beating public parks.",null,0,null,1425389977,null,0,1425413087,0,cp2vvad,null,t3_2xrzh0,null,t1_cp2vvad,null,t3_2xrzh0,null,null,null,1427553916,null,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18,null

London stirred from its postwar slump, with its regimented skyline and fraying neighbourhoods, by opening up to the world. Whether it will remain so open — or be allowed to by political forces elsewhere in the land — is one of the central questions of the general election in May, and one that liberals in the old sense must hope is answered in the affirmative.

It's not though. JCB in the UK source engines from their Indian plant, as well as from their UK plant.

At no point did you explain how - if JCB followed in Starbuck's footsteps and decided to offshore profits by charging themselves lots for Indian-origin engines - your solution of ""Tax them"" would actually work.

Lets look at *what you actually said*:

&gt; **Anything one buys from oneself should be treated as profit, and not a legitimate business expense.**
&gt;
&gt;**If they want to deduct the cost of coffee beans as a business expense, they can buy them on the open market, from a 3rd party independent supplier.**
&gt;
&gt;**I don't see why this is so hard.**

So you firstly said that the government should somehow tax turnover and internal stock transfers. You didn't explain how that would work, but that's what you said.

What are you going to tax? How are you going to stop them actually off-shoring those profits? What are you going to tax?

Apparently it's dead easy but you never actually explained how?


And as for rudeness, you're the rude and incredibly short-sighted one. When you said:

&gt; **But you know what else I realised? I don't give a fuck. Tax them.**

You weren't just addressing the owners and shareholders. You were saying ""I don't give a fuck"" about *millions* of British workers who are employees of multinationals (or subdivisions of multinationals) with some level of vertical integration, who's job your ""tax them"" policy would endanger.

And that is why I pray you will never be in a position to make policy. Because you don't understand the things you're commenting on, and - in your own words - boast not to give a fuck about the people those policies would affect! You've managed to convince yourself that you've gouged some rich people for more tax, so that's all okay!

&gt; **Why should Starbucks be treated any differently than me or the local mechanic?**

They're not. That's the entire point. Starbuck's UK is treated *exactly* the same as you. If they make no profit, they pay no tax - exactly the same as you. But remarkably enough, Starbucks Switzerland is not within the jurisdiction of HMRC! HMRC cannot tax Starbucks UK based on the profits of Starbucks Switzerland. It is outside their purview.

What people seem to be arguing (in the name of fairness!) is that subsidiaries of multinationals should be treated *differently* to solely British companies.

Perhaps by physical assault you mean a battery. There are separate crimes for varying types of physical harm which have little to do with free speech. But the point about the paradoxes is more important at any rate. 

I never said it was a threat of physical violence, you raised that point for some reason. I said it was a threat to public order and/or it can *lead* to violence hence common the categorisation of hate speech as *incitement* to violence (threats, harassment etc.). That's the technical legal rationale, for what it's worth.
_____________________________________________________________________________

Yes of course, denying the Holocaust is obviously not *in itself* a threat of physical violence. But looking at it in those terms is too superficial. What hate speech is about, and how Holocaust denial has come to be treated as a matter of hate speech, are two different things. You're equating an example with the principle and thereby somewhat conflating the two. 

What then is Holocaust denial in contemporary Europe? Is it merely speech i.e. the expression of a set belief (however erroneous we might think) or is it likely to go beyond speech in ways that might reasonably be deemed to be damaging to the public order or sects of the public (children learning about history, relations with racial minorities, etc.)? 

It's also important to consider other factors outside of the technical legal sphere of how such a society would look. Take the US for example, which is considered to have more 'open' free speech rules, and nothing technically equivalent to 'hate speech' as we do here (although there are public order/incitement to violence laws which are very similar, and practically identical *legally*). A big difference with the US is that law enforcement there can carry guns, therefore this type of speech, when it goes too far can be regulated (i.e. shut down) more effectively in practice with the result that it is not necessary to regulate it the same way *in law*. 

The other important thing to note is that the fact we are having this discussion points to a recognition by us both that there are certain ideas that societies will find repugnant and therefore attempt to restrict from spreading, whether that be through the law, or otherwise. Having an absolutely open legal framework that allows for all sorts of ideas or speech/action to circulate freely in the public domain would not remove this tendency for people to reject (perhaps violently) certain ideas, speech or actions. 

The difference is that it would be *even harder* to have an idea of what you could or couldn't say. (see Paradox 1; though not that it is necessarily easi*er* wholesale under the current framework, we can say with more certainty that it's not a good idea to deny the Holocaust in Europe)

Prices are high because we have had a credit boom. People buy houses with money they borrow, Rents are higher as we're at the tail end of that credit boom and landlords are now trying to price in profit from the rent rather than the asset price increase but people pay rent with money they earn and wages have been flat compared to property prices. So for a long time prices outpaced wages but people could buy a house with an easy to get mortgage, rent it out and then expect the price to increase and this would be their ""profit"". The problem is that this only works if rents stay low, why? because if rents go up people need to be earning more and this should mean that interest rates go up, causing borrowing costs to go up. The labour government essential broke this mechanism and left the hard working people of this country behind. - The most obvious way they did this was to not count house price increases when measuring inflation, of course they left in rent.

We have a national housing problem, we don't have a national homelessness problem. The problem is that people who are renting cannot afford to buy the kind of place they're renting because they were born a decade or two, too late, and their landlord was able to buy a property at a decent value and slowly we priced out people who buy property to live in it in favor of those who buy property to speculate.

My point there was kind of that it would be harder to do that to STV, because it's much more resonant - the number of votes = the number of seats. People get that. People like the idea of it being ""fair and rational"". It'd be easier to defend as a proponent of it, and it would have a much larger natural and established base of support.

There is a reason why the Coalition forced it to be AV, and not options or STV as Liberal activists (and plenty of others) were actually arguing and campaigning for.

some suggestions i would make: first, make the layout a little bit cleaner, it will go a long way for you to make the grid lines uniform in size, the cells uniform in size, bordering your cells, etc...people care about aesthetics. 

second: i don't mind you use our form (measured in PPG) and multiplying it by our remaining fixtures, but that doesn't really tell us much if you don't do it for chelsea, city, spurs and saints but have them all in the same list. so in a nutshell, be consistent and use a larger data set (more teams)

third: as snewo12 posted above so eloquently posted above, these stats don't really tell us much. if you were to do this again, it might be more powerful to extrapolate historical results from rodgers last few years and that will give you a better idea of his body of work.

Under the [Accessories and Abettors Act 1861](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/94/section/8) it is an offence to ""aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of an indictable* offence"" and an offender who does so will be treated by a court in the same way as the principal offender.

Case law from 1959 [National Coal Board v Gamble](http://swarb.co.uk/national-coal-board-v-gamble-qbd-1958/) it was said ""proof of intention to aid as well of knowledge of the circumstances"" is needed to convict an accessory. Essentially you need to show a *knowledge* of what is happening and an *intention* to help the offender do the main offence.

A further case from 1950 Johnson v Youden summarised that the *minimum* state of mind required of an accessory to an offence is that they must at least know the essential matters that constitute the offence to be convicted of aiding and abetting the offence.

Be aware however that some offences have specific different requirements. *An indictable offence is one which can be tried in a Crown Court, the alternative is a summary offence which is heard in Magistrates Court (lessor offences).

null,false,wanson,lfc68,,null,"It should be our strongest XI in every game from here on out. After this weekend, it's one game a week until the end of the season.

What is our strongest XI though? 

Up front: Sturridge should be in the side. He's our best striker and won't get back to his best without games. That means dropping one of Lallana, Coutinho or Sterling. Out of those three it's hard to make a case to drop anyone so it may be a case of rotating one of these three in and out of the side depending on fitness. Gerrard's return will add some extra competition here.

In midfield: Allen and Henderson are solid, so until Lucas is available, there's no choice to be made here. If either one gets injured Emre Can move in there and do a solid job, but for now he's better in defense.

In defense: Sakho, Skrtel and Can. Lovren has done well since coming back into the side but we have been much better with this back three. Can carries the ball out of defense and acts like a third midfield player most of the time. And Sakho's passing from the back is brilliant, they start a lot of attacking moves.

On the wings: Moreno at LWB - he's really come into his own there. RWB is the only position that isn't nailed down. Markovic does a good job there and since Ibe is injured, it would seem that it's his position for now. Lallana or Sterling could play there but they are much more effective in the top three.

Goal: Mignolet - he's a different player after being dropped. There's no alternative anyway.

So, This should be our lineup until the end of the season:

              Mignolet
          Can Skrtel Sakho
    Markovic            Moreno

&gt;Teachers, councillors and social workers in England and Wales who fail to protect children could face up to five years in jail under new proposals.

&gt;The new measures, being unveiled by the prime minister, would see the crime of ""wilful neglect"" extended to cover children's social care and education.

&gt;There would also be unlimited fines for individuals and organisations shown to have let children down. 

&gt;And police will now prioritise sexual exploitation as a ""national threat"".

&gt;This means such abuse will be treated in a similar way to serious and organised crime, with police forces, chief constables and police and crime commissioners having a duty to collaborate in order to protect children. 

&gt;The government's proposals - also to include a national helpline being set up to enable professionals to report bad practice - are a response to child abuse scandals including those in Rotherham and Oxfordshire.

While that may be true to some extent, immigration also drives up *demand* for services because those of us who immigrate also needs places to live, and needs to buy food, and a whole lot of other things. If the immigration is deeply skewed towards filling specific occupations, then yes, you should expect increased competition in those occupations. But if so, the same immigrants will drive demand up for occupations they are under-contributing to.

This substantially moderates any effect the increased size of the workforce creates.

null,false,Jo3Fr3sh,newcr-1,Non arte sed marte,null,"1. Howard has lost games/points for us when he has either gotten a red card, CP last year, or just given up some really bad goals. Joel was actually looking good and his form was improving. **Martinez tends to play his favorites.**  Players that are untouchable, except for injury, are Jagielka, Osman, Howard, Baines, and Barry. Naismith is more of a role player -- I would equate him to a much more likable Sean Avery (Former NHL Hockey Player). This is the core of the team and they play all the time for a REASON (see #5)  

2. Browning came in for the front end of the derby and looked really good. I thought he would feature more due to team rotation, but Martinez hasn't really rotated the team players that much. When a starter misses a game its usually an older player who starts, Hibbo over Garbutt/Browining, Oviedo over Garbutt (until recently). 

3. Playing Barkley on the wing has nothing to do with playing Naismith as a false 9. When Naismith is on his game he is very good at one touch passing through the seams of the defense and harrying them when the ball is lost. In my mind Barkley should be playing more like a box-to-box midfielder like Paul Pogba, he has the skills and the size for it. 

4. The style of play is atrocious. Possession without purpose. We're not Barca. We don't have a Messi. Everton is no where near the size of a club as Barcelona. Martinez needs to give up this silly dream and coach to the players he has. When we pass the ball sideways from defender to defender switching the sides from left to right or right to left I cringe. The players up field are static. I wish Martinez would watch American Football more and learn. Usually plays last no more than a few seconds. The QB has around 3 seconds to get rid of the ball or else he is gonna get flattened. Sometimes it's less sometimes more depending on the athleticism of the QB and how good the OL is. While the QB drops back the WRs and TEs run routes to get open; button hooks, curls, fades. Our team plays with no urgency off the ball and it shows. It allows the opposing team to set up defensively. Possession is good for calming down the tempo of the game. Otherwise no more than a few seconds in the backfield, either pass-pass-pass going forward or bomb it long. Our team right now is just standing still ball watching most of the time. This needs to change. I would also say the players need their roles defined better too. 

5.  ***You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.*** Ball movement has nothing to do with confidence on the ball for our team, it's more off the ball where we've lost confidence. The reason why Howard, Barry, Baines, and Jags play is on account of their Football intelligence to play at the level Martinez wants them to. Barcelona is a very sophisticated football side with players who have skills and an understanding of the game that is far above average (I know Suarez is the Mike Tyson of football due to his lack of impulse control but still.) Barkley and Lukaku have ridiculous skill levels, but how good is their football intelligence? Do they know how to take teams apart or are they just really gifted footballers?   I don't think the younger players understand the system as well and therefor Martinez is (1) reluctant to feature them (2) why we have gotten poor results this season. With Lukaku, Martinez is forced to play him as he cost over 20 million pounds for the club. I think this is why Lukaku was the one who spoke up saying they want to play in a more direct way to the press. 

6. Barry is the QB of the team. His passing controls the tempo of the game. He's lazy cause he's 35 and can't run like he used to which is why he is flanked by McCarthy and/or Besic to cover him defensively when he gets up field and has to track back. He is our deep lying mid-field playmaker who may be replaced by Gibson, if Gibson can remain healthy. This is also the reason why Barry never gets subbed off the pitch. 

I believe we're having these problems because the team isn't really playing the way Martinez want's them to, in addition to other teams making it more difficult for us by playing much deeper. This results in our back four playing it back and forth as we search for an outlet pass to a crowded midfield. Again, our team starts playing according to the system, we see results but can't score, the other team counters (by playing defensively at the beginning of the game) bottles us up, our players lose their concentration and begin to get frustrated due to the lack of results and fatigue, team play disintegrates as players start to play more individually relying on their skill level, play becomes static as players begin to ball watch, we concede a goal. This is why Martinez talks about losing confidence at the end of games. 

We start off really well but then fall apart by the 90th minute. *Martinez needs to focus the team on playing strong as a team at the END of games for us to start winning again*. We know all the teams in the PL are going to play us tough at the beginning by conceding possession, then wait for our players to tire out lose confidence, and play for the win at the end. Muhammad Ali called this rope-a-dope. Take the punishment early, tire out the opponent by absorbing their blows, then fight hard at the end of the match. If we can't put the other team away early we're gonna have to figure out a way to put them away late. Usually by the 90th minute we've run out of ideas and have just been reacting to the opposition, already out but still standing. We've seen this time and time again how we start to scramble at then end down by a goal or two.

Related anecdote:

I live in a similarly built-up area - a 1980s housing estate of one-up one-down starter homes and postage-stamp gardens. My new neighbour started burning rubbish, mainly wood, under a large laurel bush at the end of the garden (literally under it, to the extent that it's not going to survive if he keeps doing it). My girlfriend and I didn't mind too much as we find the smell of woodsmoke relatively pleasant.

Until we hear a massive boom, and glance out of the window to see a fireball 15ft high coming out of the top of the bush. Turns out he wasn't just burning wood and paper, he was burning plastic and old aerosol cans too, one of which went off pop.

Another neighbour had had enough, and called the fire brigade, who came and threw a bucket or two of water over it. They banged on his door but he cowardly refused to come out and talk. They said he was burning plastic, which is illegal.",null,0,null,1425395711,null,0,false,0,cp2ybyd,null,t3_2xsh0h,null,t1_cp2ybyd,null,t1_cp2y1en,null,null,null,1427555065,null,14,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,14,null
null,false,Calchitcho,null,null,null,"I think there's probably a fair split.  On the one hand you have people who just don't like foreigners, on the other you have people who live in areas that have been profoundly affected by immigration.  In the area that I grew up in (Little Venice/Maida Vale, which is in the Westminster North constituency), most of those immigrants have been wealthy and not much of a nuisance because the area has gentrified considerably since the 80s.  But in other places immigration has led to hordes of chronically poor, undereducated people who don't speak English enclosing in on white, working class communities.  

A lot of the problem of immigration stems from the kind of immigrants you deal with.  In Miliband's case, he's grown up in the upper middle-class left wing crowd.  The foreigners he deals with will be well-educated, probably from wealthy backgrounds in their native countries, working in think tanks or politics or unions or academia.   In Cameron's case, he works with wealthy foreign businessmen and donors, who have also had a privileged education (often in the UK) and as such are attuned to the customs of our society.  

On the other hand, the immigrants people in many poorer areas of the country are very different culturally.  ",null,0,null,1425395718,null,0,false,0,cp2yc37,null,t3_2xrvio,null,t1_cp2yc37,null,t1_cp2wu4l,null,null,null,1427555067,null,25,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,25,null

There is a lot more to it than just being there leaning on a gate counting heads, you will have to work with security, the volunteer medics, the filth and festival management, not to mention the muso's. 

And you have to watch your own arse and the others around you, there are some very potentialy dangerous situations. And it is hard work.

Ultimately it will have to change, because technology will oust people from their jobs faster than the current system can care for. I think we need to work with the current system rather than against it.

For example, basic income has the potential to be a huge money saver for business. Say we keep the current £700B on welfare and spend it unconditionally on £11,000 per person (64.1M people in the UK). Note that this cost is fixed to the population of the country, unlike current welfare costs which rise as unemployment does.

With my capitalist hat on I could say that someone earning £20,000 a year can now be paid £9,000 instead, with BI topping up their wage. If it seems unfair that people would be doing the same job they were doing for £11,000 less, realise that this is already true, but is masked as a bulk sum. In reality, that £11k is spent on rent, food and bills anyway, so the real wage of someone earning £20k IS only £9k (assuming their base costs are £11k per annum).

So now business can immediately cut wage costs dramatically for the same value. Yet, we aren't spending a penny more (we already spend this £700B on welfare anyway). Imagine what a boon this would be to British industry, and that's not taking into account the increased opportunity for entrepreneurship.

Now the cynical side. This would also change the economy dramatically. Suddenly people have the option to start their own business than work for a cold calling company, or McDonalds. What happens? I can't say. I suspect that people would still perform these jobs, but on a part time basis, as BI only covers basic needs such as food and rent and people want luxuries.

on another note, very optimistic outlook. i like it. lets start with a win against burnley tomorrow and keep looking at it 1 match at a time! so cliche, but every match is a cup final. i think our next two matches should see us rotate the squad. the next game, after blackburn, is against swansea (i think like 9 days later)...if we rest some key players against blackburn, that would effectively give some players 12 days rest. i said it in another thread, hendo, sterling, moreno and can might all deserve a break at least against blackburn, but maybe against both burnley and blackburn. those 4 players have been recently vital to our success and 2 weeks to recover, recharge and recycle their mindset could do us wonders for the final run in. i only feel confident enough doing this because lovren (can replacement) has been playing better in this system and is growing in stature, stevie (hendo replacement) is back fit and cannot be disregarded as the world class player he will always remain (he also has effectively had a month to recharge and focus on his fitness), markovich (sterling replacement) has scored a couple of good goals for us and really shows drive and promise in that attacking position...he is going to be a phenomenal player come the start of next season and its crazy to think we have so many young guns of his quality fighting for spots there (sterling, coutinho, ibe, even throw in ojo and lallana), and finally i believe giving a rest to moreno could be critical to the end of the season for us...i don't know who we have in the way of left back replacements, but if we have a quality full back in the academy or use lallana there as a stop gap...trust me i respect both burnley and blackburn very much, but trust me i respect the fact that some of our players would probably do well with an additional week or even few days of rest. burnley might not be one that Brendan risks any of his best players for, but he might want to consider sitting those 4 against blackburn. certainly, for both games, i think hendo has to sit because i want his injury to fully heal. cheers and thanks for the post, OP",null,0,null,1425396175,null,0,false,0,cp2ykia,null,t3_2xrpju,null,t1_cp2ykia,null,t3_2xrpju,null,null,null,1427555176,null,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0,null

I check regularly to see if there are reports of a mule, or if a coin has changed value significantly due to public interest.

The issue is who you might sell them to. There will always be someone who wants them - collectors finishing a year or specific theme. But when coins are first made the pool of people interested in them is wider because of whatever event that is being commemorated.

The Big Ben £100 coins were much more special and timeless in comparison. They were snapped up fast and people are still talking about them, so reselling them for a profit now is easier.

The Churchill coin will be sold by the mint for months, and only then will you have a chance at making a profit. But will Churchill be a topic of interest for many people?

Two 21 year olds earning a reasonably low wage of 20-25k each would mean 40-50k joint income before tax. After tax that's 36-40k. Mortgages are offered on 200k houses with a 10k deposit for £950 a month over 20 years.

So thats £11,400 for mortgage per annum. Leaving between 25-29k a year after tax and mortgage. Bills are around £100-150 a month, which leaves 23-27k a year.

Food is £30-40 a week per person, so around £70 a week, which means 19-24k left over.

Travel expenses for 2 people would depend, but a train season ticket is around £1k, car average is around £1500 a year. So that leaves 17-22k a year left over.

Lets say every month you spend £200, which is quite a bit even if you took a holiday or two, each on other expenses and entertainment. 12-17k left over which could all be saved or used for early mortgage payments.

There is likely several possible reasons for this though. Some people will say those in larger immigrant communities have seen its not as bad as UKIP et al. portray. UKIP et al. will say of course they're least popular in major immigrant areas, because immigrants aren't going to vote for UKIP. 

Another important reason is the way constituencies have been drawn, though that isn't the fault of either UKIP or immigrants. Here's the [foreign born population by Parliamentary constituency](http://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/data-and-resources/charts/foreign-born-population-parliamentary-constituency-2011-census).

The data the OP study examines is far too basic to get a true understanding of how immigration affects wages and employment. Just compare their methodology yourself. The research I linked has developed a formula that takes into account many different factors and comes to a proper scientific conclusion. the OP research has simply taken some figures about immigration by county and average wage and employment levels and plotted them on a graph. There is no way you can argue that the OP is anywhere near as accurate a study as the one I linked.  
The two papers do not reach the same conclusion. The OP article says that there has been no significant effect on wages or employment as a result of immigration, whereas the more detailed study concludes that there is a significant effect on wags and employment of low wage workers:

&gt;Although the overall wage effect of immigration may therefore be close to zero, the effects of immigration should be differently felt along the wage distribution, possibly depressing wages of workers who are in segments of the labour market where the density of immigrants is higher than that of native workers.

&gt;Our estimated wage effects along the wage distribution are strikingly in line with the location of immigrants: while  Immigration depresses wages below the 20th percentile

&gt;The regression results show a sizeable negative impact of immigration on the lower wage quantiles.

Plenty of people are or have been liberal, religious, scientists or illiberal, irreligious, dogmatists or any combination of the three. See, for example, Nietzsche and Marx, both mentioned in the article, who while very different philosophically were both illiberal, atheistic and not scientists - indeed were both suspicious of the science of their time. Or Newton, who was a deeply religious scientist.

&gt;As an organised movement, atheism ... always goes with an alternative belief-system – typically, a set of ideas that serves to show the modern west is the high point of human development. In Europe from the late 19th century until the second world war, this was a version of evolutionary theory that marked out western peoples as being the most highly evolved.

Again, it's hard to see what problem you have with this. Atheism as an organised movement these days, whether it's the BHA or the Brights, implicitly or explicitly claim that they - and by extension, the society they occupy - are the pinnacle of human achievement.

&gt;DAE Atheism is a racist, negative, and unscientific belief system?

No, and nor does the author.

On one hand, for certain goods we want to buy the latest and greatest; I don't expect my phone to last for more than a few years, or my laptop, just because those types of electronics change and improve so much year by year. On the other hand, some products don't improve that much over time—does anybody think washing machines or ovens have improved much over the last decade?

I've been thinking about this recently. I wanted to buy an electric hand mixer, the cheapest one Argos sells is about £5, now I'm sure that functions and works but I wouldn't want to buy it because I'm convinced it wouldn't last long. But then I wonder how much do I need to spend on one that will last? Even the branded products (the likes of Russel and Hobbs, Kenwood) look 'cheap', and I've found reviews stating that cutting corners is making them wear out prematurely. These branded ones are under £25; then again it's a hand mixer, how complex can they be?

My mother has a hand mixer that's older than me (23) and it's still going! I'm not sure how much that will have cost compared to today, but if it's expensive, is it worth it? For such products, I don't see the need to 'upgrade'. I'd love to think I could buy a hand mixer and never need to buy one ever again. More than just the cost of replacing it, I hate the expendability of some modern goods, I don't think of household electronics as being disposable; I don't want to feel like I'm wasting materials by having to replace crap electronics.

If I buy a £10 mixer that lasts... 5 years? Is that good value? Or is it better to spend £50 on a mixer that outlives me?

Here's my simple suggestion: disassociate the two things. Being a supporter is not the same as being involved in the criminal aspect of the supporting. I concern myself with ONLY what happens on the pitch (or try my best to) and those few small things that directly involve this (i.e. trades, injuries, etc.) I don't care what player is sleeping with whom, what fan said what awful thing, scandals, match fixing, or whatever else. I find it easy to do this because my appreciation is for the game, not for the culture. I have the advantage of distance, and  I do a lot of reading about the surrounding events as far as books and whatnot, but I have no interest in being involved in the culture. The more you appreciate the sport itself, the less the supporting seems to matter. 

Also, this other person has their own opinion, and they are condemning something you enjoy and love. you need to realize that it's their own opinion. They may actually respect you more if you are able to disagree with them but not argue. Nobody likes a ""yes"" man. So rather than just agree, maybe agree to disagree. Don't you think that maybe there are plenty of aspects of your love that they don't understand? If they have such staunch views, I imagine they've never even given it any consideration that football is an amazing game that unites the world every four years. Sure, some people take it a bit too far, but they are not the majority. 

Here, you want a little fact that further proves this point? This is something from the book Soccernomics (summarized): [On investigating whether there are more suicides in a country when their national team gets knocked out of the world Cup] 'People tend to experience losses like these together, so those who would typically isolate themselves and deal with heartache by themselves find that they're in a community that suffers the loss as a group instead. The result, then, is that those people endure the loss and form stronger bonds because of it, rather than suffer individually.'

Football/soccer is a unifying event for both club supporters and the people of a nation. Focusing on the bad that a small group does is simply isolating something that someone does not agree with and generalizing the entire idea. It's closed-minded, and lacks consideration of the sport as a whole, instead focusing on what that person needs in order to make their point. 

I hope you're able to enjoy the sport for what it is. After all, it is just a game, but it's been one of the most satisfying things in my life besides riding motorcycles for me (another thing which people like to generalize and hate on.... oh, and they love to tell you stories of people who died doing it and make up bs stats to support their point as well... that's a fun discussion). Some people just enjoy tearing down the things that others love because they don't understand it or they lack something of equal passion  or they just don't want to look beyond their own emotions about it. Find your own position and discuss it. Tell them why you love it rather than trying to debate their negatives. You'll never win an argument with a deaf person, so abandon that idea. I've hugged people I don't know in pubs before after a huge win. I've bought beers and had them bought for me. It's an amazing thing that 11 kids on a patch of grass can bring that to so many others. what a fucking unbelievable things that is. If all else fails, remind them that Justin Bieber is a person, and people willingly give him money. There are worse things to support in this world.

&gt;""The economists also specifically whether lower-skilled workers...""

Specifically what?

As for the study, don't immigrants self-select the areas they choose to work in? If an area has weak employment prospects, do they not steer-clear of it. With no anchor in that community, they have little attraction to the area. 

Likewise if an area has high employment prospects would wages rise and unemployment fall regardless of if immigration was an issue?

The study hasn't discovered a causal link between immigration and employment/wages prospects.

My observation and thought is that immigrants are typically self-selected industrious types from their home country. The 'lazy and feckless' Polish won't leave Poland, but the ones with a strong work-ethic will. On the one hand stronger workers are good for the economy overall. On the other-hand, any discussion of workers undercutting each other draws suggestions of 'racing to the bottom'.",null,0,null,1425398941,null,0,1425399217,0,cp302b0,null,t3_2xrvio,null,t1_cp302b0,null,t3_2xrvio,null,null,null,1427555919,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

'What is the cause for extremism?' - I think it is: poverty, fear, lack of education, hunger, horrible experiences.

'Where is religion in the last answer?' - I think religion is not a cause of extremism but ONE possible tool to steer the people that suffer under poverty, fear, lack of education, hunger, horrible experiences.

That's not to say these things don't happen, because obviously they do, and god knows I know a fair amount of women that have been mistreated (and there was always at least one girl in year 9 that had an ""older"" boyfriend, apparently the man round the corner from my childhood home was a paedo) ...but this story today feels really out of the ordinary.

*edit to add* I live in Seattle now, and the part of the city I live in seems to have FAR more of a grooming/roaming paedophile problem.

The people who wrote the tax laws in the first place, I suppose.

&gt; I mean offshoring has been going for decades and is well known to the HMRC. I honestly don't see how you can claim using a trust fund in the Caymans is some cunning and unforeseeable exploit in the system.

It may be well known, but it's not necessarily desirable. The ability to move cash or profits offshore - thereby avoiding certain taxes levied by the government of the country in which you reside - primarily exists because of the lack of international cooperation on the matter. Tax loopholes like this are not unforeseeable - and neither did I claim that they are - but they are nevertheless undesirable, from the point of the view of this government - and most others as well.

&gt; You're also wrong about ""any sensible person"" seeing the difference. The article is evidence that most people see tax avoidance as just as immoral as tax evasion, although I've argued here that the former is the government's fault for leaving legal loopholes while the latter is criminal.

That's a different question entirely. It may well be that many people deem legal tax avoidance to be equally immoral as illegal tax evasion, but the fact remains that they are plainly different by their very nature. One may label tax avoidance as ""immoral"" if they wish, but the difference between it and tax evasion must be acknowledged in terms of the reasons they exist, the legal ramifications of exploiting them, and the ability of the government to eradicate them.

12/13 Rodgers inherited the likes of Andy Carroll, Charlie Adam, Jay Spearing, Stewart Downing and had to sell to buy (FSG didn't give him a lot of money to work with back then), those that he couldn't sell he had to try fit them into his kind of system. This was always a ""transitional"" season.

13/14 Suarez was banned for the start of the season, but with some scrappy wins we built the foundation for the best season we've seen in the premier league era.

14/15 We lost Suarez, Sturridge was injured, and Brendan had to bring five new signings into the first team. We were disjointed but eventually he found a way to make it work. Some would argue he should have experimented sooner, but with our hectic schedule he was probably reluctant to change too much at once which I can understand.

15/16 If we hang on to our key players in the summer and find a back-up for Sturridge (Ings?), who knows what could happen. We should bring in enough money from Aspas, Borini, Balotelli(?), Luis Alberto, and Glenn Johnson (big wages off the books) to buy one or two quality players where we need a little extra strength. A quality midfielder to compete with Allen since Gerrard's retiring, and a quality goalkeeper should be all we need.

2. Also important is routine. When I go into the supermarket (Lidl, btw, forget anywhere not Lidl/Aldi) I have about £2 variance, and the rest is the same stuff. 8 wraps, 8 cans of tuna, 4 chicken breast fillets, 4 cods, any additional thing, bread, milk. The times where I've gone shopping with my family in places like Tesco or Asda and seen people chuck every other item into the basket now baffle me.

3. Don't bother trying to work on a daily budget, it simply doesn't work (at least on £4). Instead, know how much you can spend in a week and keep within that - the things you'll need out of the blue are normally above £4. You can try but I wouldn't bother.

4. Buying something big/routine? Remember to use Quidco or some other cashback scheme. Every little helps.

Most forecasts for global peak oil were in the 2005-2030 range, and in 2005 conventional production peaked out, so we're well on track for peak in the next decade or so.

null,false,agentdcf,flair8,,null,"I think your more important point was ""But the competition has been good for us, and we might not have the Harry Kane that we do were it not for this season’s Europa League."" This is why Europa is absolutely *vital* for us: we need those extra fixtures to help us develop players, to hone our game plans, and to allow second-choice players runs in competitive matches. Yes, it's true, it does present problems of rotation and it challenges our depth. But, if we have any aspirations of making the Champions League, we need to be able to stand the rigors of multiple competitions. 

Plus, I love to watch my club play, and I want them to play as many matches as possible.

I'd also like to take this opportunity to ask about your thoughts on the squad moving forward. I thought Seb and Raj were right on when they noted on their pod yesterday that ""we really didn't learn anything new"" from the match at Wembley. We already knew that we have a strong starting XI with a promising young spine in Kane, Eriksen, Bentaleb, Mason, and Dier, along with a few important veterans like Lloris and Vertonghen. We also knew that Chelsea is better and far more experienced than we are, and they showed this in a very ""professional"" game where they executed their plan quite well and took advantage of a few fortunate bounces.

One take-away I have from this match and the season overall to this point is that there aren't too many really glaring holes in our lineup, so much as a broad need for improvement and depth across the board. If we're going to achieve more in the next few years, for example, then guys like Eriksen and Kane will need to continue to develop, elevate their games, and learn consistency. There are certainly many players who can and will continue to improve, including the spine I mentioned, as well as Lamela (who still has a ways to go but has a very high ceiling if he can reach it). If this is the case, though, it makes for an intriguing summer since there don't seem to be massive gaps crying out to be filled. 

Some of the things that I'd really like to see is another deeper midfield player to either rotate with Mason, to push Mason to the second XI and so shield him from injury and fatigue, or to allow him to play in more attacking situations. I think we also need another striker, since neither Soldado nor Adebayor appear to be useful options. And, we need someone to solidify a spot as a rotation option for Eriksen. If this is Dembele, I'm alright with that, although I've never been a massive fan of his. One final thing to consider is whether it would be better to go out and find like-for-like alternatives for players, or to deliberately seek players with slightly different skill sets to give us more flexibility in how we come at our opponents.

So, what do you think? Without putting you on the spot to name specific players, what areas would you like to see addressed? Feel free to answer wherever you'd most prefer, if that's on a later Fighting Cock episode, on your blog, whatever.

My principle complaint would be that he uses simple arithmetic to compare the TV deals.  It just doesn't work that way.

Add in a pile more medium sized brands and you have a very valuable product.  In comparison, Scottish footballing brands are smaller; they have a much lower profile, and thus less commercial appeal.

Tax relief on mortgage interest is being able to buy a property, rent it out. Then any amount of money that comes from the rent but you pay to the bank that is interest on the mortgage you don't count as income so you don't have to pay tax on it. So if you buy a place, rent it out but 70% goes to the bank on a interest only mortgage you only have to worry about counting the 30% as income.

Which is all fine and dandy, until people start buying a flat for the maximum amount they can borrow on an interest only mortgage then rent it out covering the cost of the mortgage and some costs expecting the price of the property increase as their future profit/income. Now the person who is buying to let it out is competing with someone who is buying to live in it. The problem is the BTL ""investor"" has a tax advantage.

The tax relief on credit is actually to blame for a slew of problems. Boots, Topman and RAC employees maybe be able to tell you.

- NATO would be severely weakened, therefore increasing the fear for our Eastern European allies who are already scared of Russia.

- Scrapping Trident would be very costly to do, where as renewing Trident is more cost effective as the cost is spread out over 17 years.

- The alternatives are less desirable, will take time to develop, research and to perfect, which in an ever changing world, is illogical.

At this stage, the crisis would be priced in, and you would be crystallising a loss. Plenty of people did this in the midst of the 2008 crash and severely damaged their wealth.

The question is; can you time the markets? Can you see in advance that it'll all go to pot?

If the answer is yes, you can, then everybody could. And if that was the case, everybody would sell out in advance. And if that was the case, the crash would be priced in. D'oh! We're back at step one.

Therefore, let's assume that nobody can predict in advance (unless you happen to know a good psychic). You could take one of two well-used approaches:

* Never sell. Just keep trucking, being glad you're buying more at a cheaper price. This is the most straightforward method and least likely to result in regret.
* Operate a value-based portfolio. Sell shares when they look ""expensive"", and buying when they look ""cheap"" (using some metric like PE10, or relative yield to risk-free investments).

&gt; The ability to move cash or profits offshore - thereby avoiding certain taxes levied by the government of the country in which you reside - primarily exists because of the lack of international cooperation on the matter.

With which countries do we need to cooperate in order to prevent rich people salting money away in Jersey or the Isle of Man?

Regarding tax avoidance I think we're quite close in our views. It's legal but immoral. The morality of the country is protected by the government's ability to legislate. So if immoral things are happening then it's up to the government to deal with them.

&gt; Last night, my friend was walking down Broadstreet after getting off a bus and the following happened:

&gt; 3 Asian men in a white AMG Merc (registration redacted), started shouting out 'bitch', she ignored and walked past a hotel, they pulled in front of the hotel and tried to get her to come to their car.

&gt; She obviously refused and the kept trying to convince her ""please, just two steps closer, your safe, I'm not going to grab you"".

&gt; During this, the male talking had a glass of yellow liquid in his hand.

&gt; I went and meet her shortly after, found the car and reported them to the police (hence licence plate above).

&gt; The police took this very seriously, agreed to the possibility of this being an acid attack was very real.

&gt; The group were stopped, searched and warned. They now have antisocial markers on them and the car.

&gt; CCTV showed they had been circling the area for sometime and after me taking their plate - they did follow us and were found only a few streets from where I live.

&gt; If a further incident happens they will be arrested and if the car is involved it will be seized.

Apologies for some of the choppy language used - it was a hurried account - but I don't doubt its validity and have seen a photo of the car in question sent by the girl this happened to.

The worlds most prosperous nations are largely a result of welcoming immigrants, but there is a key difference in the UK when it comes to immigration. We are a tiny Island with very little room (considering how strict green belt laws are). 

So essentially Housing + Immigration = Problem. 

We cannot house extra people migrating to the UK, without it resulting in the current populace being priced out of the market or facing high rents. 

Net migration into the UK increased by more than 38% to 243,000 in 2013-14, its expected to be higher for the next period. 118,760 homes were built, and that's along with the chronic under supply from the previous years to make it worse. 243,000 is equivalent to a substantially sized town, all needing housing.

The result is large areas of the country are unaffordable to even rent, let alone the old British dream of owning a home (that will now just remain a dream for far too many of us now). 

Now that is not an immigration issue in entirety, but its a major issue all the same. We either stop people coming here, or we start building huge amounts of housing, which in turn means we need to relax building laws on green sites.

So we shut the gates, or start building on England's beloved greenery. ",null,0,null,1425407630,null,0,1425407971,0,cp35iye,null,t3_2xrvio,null,t1_cp35iye,null,t1_cp2t7ko,null,null,null,1427558468,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

First thing to know is that it was costing them a bomb to keep it updated and on going, because it had such old buildings (some were in use, some weren't) there was always stuff breaking. Also the lead was getting nicked last year.
There was also problems with the accommodation blocks, included a big ladybug infestation for some poor student of a particular room I won't go into detail about. Hehe.

The last thing to know is that there is a big rumour, or more than likely truth - Is that whoever runs UWE wants it all to be based at Frenchay, a sort of university city if you like.

It was the money that meant St Matthias closed, it was the easiest campus to warden (The Hollies, which is now the easiest was second) due to on site support (because it was a campus as well there were CSO's &amp; security, whereas Hollies had none of that)
It's sad to see it go, I really wanted to get up on top of one of the roofs on the old building, there's a ladder that had a supposed anti climbing cage around it that I was able to climb up and over it when there was that closing party. But the hatch to get outside was locked, damn it.
I also happen to have a few things from St Matts, one was a big ass poster of all these articles and other stuff that I won in the auction. I also have a thermometer and some door signage. Hehe.

City: Played them well both times, should have won at the Etihad if it wasn't for a missed penalty call and 2 missed red cards by the ref. 

Arsenal: Played horrible at the Emirates, played very well at home and blew the lead in the final minutes.

ManU: Would have had a draw if it wasn't for a saved penalty. 

Liverpool: Got lucky with Jagielka's best shot of his life to draw at Anfield, and played lifeless at home, but luckily so did Liverpool.

Southampton: Played horrible all around for 90 minutes and absolutely deserved to get demolished.

Donna Noble: She had the trifecta: interesting personality, great chemistry with the doctor, and a hell of a story arc. Her story is my favorite of all the companions. At first, when I saw that the shrieking biatch from Runaway Bride was returning, I was terrified. But by the miming scene in Partners in Crime, I was sold. The easy friendship between her and the Doctor was a relief; I feel that she was actually a benefit to the Doctor. The lack of the romantic subplot was also pulled off perfectly, without the story or friendship feeling empty. 

Rose: She was my first and will always be dear to my heart. The feeling between her and the Doctor was palpable; it felt real. She too helped the Doctor grow. As pat as it was, I'm glad that she got her meta-Ten. 

Rory: he was more Amy's companion than the Doctor's but I love him for it. Here we have a person embodying true love and loyalty and yet his character didn't feel like a characterization. I also like that he called the Doctor on some of his shit, and was often the voice of reason, without devolving into pettiness. 

Amy: I liked the start and end of her story but the middle is a bit muddled (to put it mildly). She is flawed but at least her flaws seem to make sense; they are coherent. With her too the relationship between her and the Doctor feels natural, though I am not sure that she was necessarily good for him. (She provided companionship which is a definite good but I don't think she really challenged him.)

Martha: I liked who she was. But she was a doomed companion. They never truly bonded. I respect her for knowing when to call it quits. 

Clara: I should preface this with ""she is the first companion I have despised."" I liked her as dalek-girl and as nanny-in-Victorian times. She intrigued me as she did the Doctor. I was pretty ambivalent towards her for the rest of series 7 though her story began to irritate me: she simply became too important. Especially didn't like that bit where she tells the Doctor which TARDIS to pick. Series 8 they decide to make her a person rather than a deus ex machina. Why they decided to make her into a manipulative, hypocritical, emotionally unstable bully is beyond me. I feel that she is a toxic influence on the Doctor. She gives me emotional whiplash; I can't imagine how that feels to someone who cares about her. I really hope she mellows out in Series 9. I don't think I can take much more of this.

&gt;It's a tough question because the stuff they are trying to do tends to be huge but then the private sector delivers massive projects on time and on budget all the time so it must be possible.

I've seen several very large private sector IT projects fail hard, though admittedly not as big as this one. Maybe it was just too ambitious? Are you aware of any private sector projects as big as this? 

&gt;The big problem, and I'm not sure this will be a popular view, is politicians, the media and the public.

I'm sure that doesn't help. As in many other areas, the need to be seen to be doing something can be very counter-productive. 

&gt;With that in mind I have come to the conclusion that it is just too big to be centrally managed, because to do so would require an iron fist for which there is no political will. And on that basis I think the CCG system is a good one.

The [Euro Health
Consumer Index](http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/EHCI_2014/EHCI_2014_report.pdf) seems to agree with you. Sweden pays about as much as the UK for healthcare (around 9% GDP) and delivers almost the best outcomes in Europe, and it's a decentralised system. It will be interesting to see how Greater Manchester does now that it has control over its health and social care budget.

&gt;As for wider issues about any large public project I think there should be less focus on screwing the private company down to the lowest possible price and more on deliverability and value.

That makes sense, but there are always allegations of corruption when someone other than the lowest bidder gets the work, even though the bid price may have no relationship to what's actually paid. 

&gt;I think that they should have tightly defined scopes which as far as possible should be completely free from meddling as the project continues. 

That requires an element of Big Design Up Front - how do you ensure that the project is still relevant when it's complete? Or do you break it down into small incremental deliverables?

If you actually remember what we're arguing about, rather than spewing your weird agenda, you would see you are wrong. I said many Muslims do indeed partake in killing people (""chopping off their heads"") because of their religion.

You said it was ""a few thousand"" out of 1.5 billion.

I'm saying 13 countries (all Muslim) will kill people for apostasy and/or blasphemy.

With little/no opposition to these laws, you can assume most of the population agree. 

Our society **is** morally superior to theocratic countries'. There is no death penalty, there is trial by jury and no penalty for believing or not believing in religion. That is an undeniable truth. To think otherwise is preposterous.

null,false,HistoryLessonforBitc,,Card-carrying Labour supporter,null,"&gt; Well if you think about it the only other parties which wished to leave the European Union and focus on immigration which had any popularity previously were racist parties, now that UKIP is gaining some decent momentum, UKIP is the closest thing to representation that those who are racist want.

That doesn't necessarily follow unless Ukip policies are in some way specifically attractive to outright racists. There are plenty of non-racist (and non-immigration related) reasons to object to the EU and there are parties that are actually explicitly racist (e.g. the BNP). The only logical explanation, and the only one that actually makes any sense, is that racist people *intrinsically like Ukip policy because it gels with their views*.

Of course, there is also the thing that a lot of Ukip supporters, frankly, seem utterly deluded as to what the party actually stands for - some of them seem convinced that it will start nationalising things if it gains power, so it's entirely possible that the aforementioned racists may be projecting their desire to kick out all the darkies onto it as well. But in that case, all that means is that Ukip has done such a terrible job of articulating what it actually stands for - its core principles - that it is essentially a blank slate for anyone with a grievance against the established parties.

&gt; UKIP does do stuff to get rid of those kind of people as well, they don't currently have the funding of the bigger parties and when a member says something particularly outrageous they are promptly investigated and more than often kicked from the party ever since popularity was gained.

You don't need funding to tell someone to piss off out of your party because you don't tolerate racism. That's a frankly pisspoor excuse, if not an actual non sequitur.

And we are still, funding or no funding, left with the ultimate conclusion that racists are drawn to Ukip because the policies they have expressed are concordant with racist beliefs.

&gt; I think UKIP needs more time to grow, it has some good grounds for somebody like me to support but it needs to get better candidates, members and such.

It needs principles. I can tell you pretty much where most of the parties stand in a sentence or two, the core beliefs that make up their thought and inform their policy, but Ukip's policy is so haphazard and incoherent that I have trouble forming such an impression of them. Just to head this off - that does not mean that Ukip are somehow ""radical"" or ""breaking out of the left-right system"", it means that *they have no actual principles anchoring them*, which is a very troubling thing for a political party as it points to the only thing beneath their policy being naked populism and the chasing of easy votes.",null,0,null,1425408656,null,0,false,0,cp367de,null,t3_2xrbpc,null,t1_cp367de,null,t1_cp34v74,null,null,null,1427558784,null,10,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,10,null

No, unemployment is lower than the rest of the country, and more importantly, I simply can't do my job anywhere else in the country. It doesn't exist. 

&gt;Public parks - Simply doesn't compare to, let's say the Brecon Beacons, the Scottish Highlands, The Pennines...so you have parks...wow. So let's discount that, too.

Good luck finding a job in the Brecon Beacons, beautiful as they clearly are. I live opposite a huge Royal Park, with deer wandering around. I also live 20 mins from the centre of London. Hard to beat.

&gt;Higher wages - To cover the inflated cost of living. So let's discount that, too.

I'd never get a wage like mine outside of London

&gt;More culture - This is just ignorance. It doesn't take more than a few seconds on Google to discover the vast amount of Cultural heritage and events in the rest of the country.

Of course there is culture outside of London. I prefer to live closer to the biggest concentration of it though.

&gt;Great Food - You're talking to someone who lives in the city with the most Michelin starred restaurants outside of London

Yep, say no more. More and better restaurants in London, obviously.

&gt;Your list isn't looking that hot, anymore. Let's continue...
&gt;People from all over the world - Granted the ethnic diversity is less obvious in the rest of the country, but as the current trend appears to be a push to get rid of that wonderfully diverse ethnic mix, I'm suspicious of you using it as a positive.

Diversity is increasing all the time in London. It's more often those outside of London who are suspicious of immigrants, voting for UKIP etc. We happen to like it!

Very well: the government of the day, then :)

&gt; With which countries do we need to cooperate in order to prevent rich people salting money away in Jersey or the Isle of Man?

Jersey and the Isle of Man are crown dependencies; they are self-governing and so decide their own tax laws. Of course, their relationship with the UK is a lot closer than that of other countries, but the UK government has no constitutional influence of their tax laws.

&gt; Regarding tax avoidance I think we're quite close in our views. It's legal but immoral. The morality of the country is protected by the government's ability to legislate. So if immoral things are happening then it's up to the government to deal with them. So they may not deal with forms of tax avoidance deemed beneficial (like ISAs or charitable status) but they really should deal with offshore trusts and non-doms.

I largely agree with this, although I wouldn't personally go so far as to say that legal tax avoidance is ""immoral"".",null,0,null,1425409293,null,0,false,0,cp36mme,null,t3_2xoegm,null,t1_cp36mme,null,t1_cp34c8z,null,null,null,1427559050,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

You wouldn't need it. You could be on a lower wage and retain or increase your quality of life. If you were to keep the same wage, you would be exponentially better off anywhere that wasn't London. You're being ripped off because of where you live. Hey, your choice.

&gt; I prefer to live closer to the biggest concentration of it though.

Second point which equates to the convenience of everything is a small radius...so is that laziness? If someone outside of London, or unemployed was to expound the virtues of wanting everything within a mile or two of their home, you'd soon call them lazy.

&gt; More and better restaurants in London, obviously.

Third point suggesting the laziness of convenience. There are more Michelin starred restaurants outside of London than inside. They're just further apart.

Nearly everybody does it already. Stock parts usually have MTBF statistics, and parts manufactured in house are usually tested. There are statistical techniques for taking the MTBF for all the parts and calculating the MTBF for the product.  Manufacturers have to do this to ensure they won't make a loss on warranty repairs or get a bad reputation from consumer groups. Warranty repairs are analysed and the results fed back into the statistics.

As you mention, the environment is a factor, so the MTBF will be valid for a given environmental range. So there may be types of damage that aren't covered in the warranty.

Doesn't look like Villareal are going to make the CL, so I can believe he'd be open to offers. Not overly confident about our interest or ability to sign him over other potential suitors, but I hope there's substance to this because he's exactly the kind of player we'd need. 

There's every chance we'll have only Sturridge and Origi out of our current striking contingent next season, so we'd be adding at least one forward to that, and Vietto is one of those players who'd be ideal in that he can both play alongside Sturridge and in place of him, and because of his pace, control and finishing, he'd fit in no matter what system or formation we play. A great option - definitely better than Ings, who's a decent player but not exactly one I see starting games unless others are missing - and one who's at least somewhat realistic if we get CL football again.

UK DVB-T (Freeview) transmits between roughly 600 MHz and just over 800 MHz depending on your location. Each channel (or rather group of channels - a multiplex) operate by transmitting in small 'chunks' from 600 MHz upwards. One mux might transmit within 600-608 MHz, the next within 609-617 MHz, and so on.

Some areas will transmit muxes in the mid-800 MHz range; the very top end of the spectrum allocation for Freeview. Freeview boxes have a habit (or design feature) of being overly-sensitive to bands beyond their target frequency. If the box thinks it is receiving a too strong a signal, even from a peripheral band outside of its target range, it will shut down.

In some cases, Freeview boxes will pick up the very loud local 4G cell and disable the the mux of stations on the top (mid-800 MHz) channel.

The solution, as has been the plan for years is to install a (free) attenuator on your aerial jack. It's very similar to your DSL filter on your phone line. If you're one of the few homes that is way too close to a 4G cell, you'll get a free FreeSat setup.",null,0,null,1425410265,null,0,1425410457,0,cp379f8,null,t3_2xt1ix,null,t1_cp379f8,null,t3_2xt1ix,null,null,null,1427559346,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

You need what most people would call ""normal tea"" or ""builders' tea"" (Common brands include PG Tips, Tetley, Yorkshire, Twinings, Typhoo etc.) - usually called ""English breakfast"" if you're not in the UK. 

You put the teabag in the hot water for a couple of minutes, remove it, and add milk to taste. Put sugar in if you must, but I will be silently judging you from across the Atlantic.

You may also wish to source a McVities Digestive to dunk in your tea for the full experience.

When you can snatch the ~~pebble~~ teabag from my hand, you will be ready to leave.

Once you get the hang of normal tea, you can start experimenting with alternative flavours, if you want to. But you have to remember that ""English breakfast"" or ""tea"", as it is properly called, is the one true tea and all others are merely pretenders to the throne. 

Options include:

Assam - one of the main ingredients in normal tea

Keemun or Yunnan - slightly nutty

Ceylon - slightly citrusy

Chai - kind of spicy

Darjeeling - light, I think technically oolong

Earl Grey - lemony and bergamotty 

Lady Grey - Even more citrussy Earl Grey

Lapsang Souchong - smokey (delicious)


You may also wish to branch out in you choice of biscuit, if your ducking technique is solid. I recommend Hobnobs, Rich Teas and Chocolate Digestives as a good bridge from the conventional digestive to more niche biscuits. Whatever you do, do not dunk a Jaffa Cake as they are (a) not a biscuit, I don't care what HMRC say, and (b) disgusting when wet.

Train tickets, for example. Getting a train from, say, Hainault to Central London every day is going to cost you about £3,000 a year a person. That's just how much these things cost these days.

Food, likewise, isn't going to cost £30 per person unless you're eating on a shoestring budget in an area where prices are cheap (e.g., not where jobs are). Food prices have inflated substantially over the last seven years. You're going to need to bump those estimates up too.

Income is tricky too, because student loan payments will decay your payslip too. Even on 25k you should be expecting to pay ~£150 a month per person at least.

A 10k deposit on a 200k house - a 5% mortgage - is probably going to get you unfavourable terms, at least from most lenders. You really need to be doubling that deposit, as well as saving for legal fees and the like. You'll have to find another grand or so if a sale falls through or you're gazundered.

null,false,ZekkPacus,eng-essex,Essex,null,"Basically there are two ways to do it.

The government guarantees a 95% LTV mortgage, so all you need is a 5% deposit, but you won't see the best interest rates there and it can end up costing you several thousand pounds over the life of a loan - using one high street bank as an example, Santander will charge you 4.9% vs as low as 1.99% on a more traditional 80% LTV, which will cost you an extra ~£200/month on a £150,000 mortgage.

The other way is that the government loans you 20% - you bring your 5% deposit, they loan you 20%, you get a 75% LTV. That gets you access to the best rates BUT the equity loan is only interest free for the first five years - after that you're repaying interest, which starts at 1.75% but rises at RPI + 1% every year. That can quickly become a hell of a lot of money - the sums are beyond me at the moment, but suffice to say over the length of a 25 year mortgage it's a lot of money. You have to pay it back at the end of your mortgage or when you sell up, and in addition it gives the Help to Buy agent certain rights - you can't extend or alter the property without their permission, and they have to agree any sale price when you do move. 

Basically both schemes are just good for getting people who really can't afford it onto the housing ladder. The housing market needs to be allowed to crash, but any government that does that will be wiped out for a generation so they're not going to do it.

One of the reasons that students go to Glasgow is doubtless to experience the local culture and history of another country - that is indeed one of the reasons to go to university at all, so I'm not sure why you think they would want the university divorced from its own history and given placeless, multinational, multiethnic names.

By the same token, the city shouldn't rename the streets even though many of them are named after slavers, colonists, and otherwise repellant dead white men. Like it or not that's the history of the place and it should not be reinvented in some naming revolution just to appease the wishes of tiny cohort of ""campaigners"" - campaigners who suppose that women and ethnic minorities are so incredibly fragile that they must be sheltered from the harsh reality of history.

Atlético, Arsenal, Manchester United in the 90s.

&gt;The frequent failure of well funded clubs over the decades suggests otherwise.

Chelsea were already in a decent position unlike almost every other **extremely** well-funded club, and a lot of these clubs fail these days due to not enough demand to play in their league/city or an owner's lack of patience. Nothing to do with how well the club is run in terms of the football, managerial prowess or transfer policy, there were tonnes of over-priced players and failures at Chelsea in the mid 2000s but that didn't matter unlike the huge risks most clubs have to consider when buying players over 30m. Abramovich was the first to do it so he had an advantage with this also, players have a wide choice of small clubs to go to now that will pay them 100k+ a week so there's more competition for the top players.

null,false,Zanza_N,,UKIP | It's all about Nuttall,null,"&gt;That doesn't necessarily follow unless Ukip policies are in some way specifically attractive to outright racists. There are plenty of non-racist (and non-immigration related) reasons to object to the EU and there are parties that are actually explicitly racist (e.g. the BNP). The only logical explanation, and the only one that actually makes any sense, is that racist people *intrinsically like Ukip policy because it gels with their views*.

Well....no it does work like that. UKIP aren't being racist but they have put out a line to reduce and control immigration, for example a BNP supporter has to think logically that BNP won't get in, so they switch to UKIP since it's the closest thing to what they want.

&gt;Of course, there is also the thing that a lot of Ukip supporters, frankly, seem utterly deluded as to what the party actually stands for - some of them seem convinced that it will start nationalising things if it gains power, so it's entirely possible that the aforementioned racists may be projecting their desire to kick out all the darkies onto it as well. But in that case, all that means is that Ukip has done such a terrible job of articulating what it actually stands for - its core principles - that it is essentially a blank slate for anyone with a grievance against the established parties.

I think what UKIP stands for is abundantly clear, other members might not see that but that's their fault rather than UKIP. 

Their policies section of their site has a fair few policies to help give a very good impression of what UKIP stands for. The main policy for UKIP is obviously that they wish to leave the EU and a vote for them is a pressure vote into making the main parties give a referendum and take a more anti-EU approach.

&gt;You don't need funding to tell someone to piss off out of your party because you don't tolerate racism. That's a frankly pisspoor excuse, if not an actual non sequitur.

Not quite, more funding is going to mean you can reach further to find candidates, it means you can have better methods to find who is a bad fit for the party, currently they appear to have pretty terrible standards due to how fast they've tried to grow and some of the candidates chosen to fight for some seats.

&gt;And we are still, funding or no funding, left with the ultimate conclusion that racists are drawn to Ukip because the policies they have expressed are concordant with racist beliefs.

That's as I already said, their policies will attract racists even though they aren't racist.

&gt;It needs principles. I can tell you pretty much where most of the parties stand in a sentence or two, the core beliefs that make up their thought and inform their policy, but Ukip's policy is so haphazard and incoherent that I have trouble forming such an impression of them. Just to head this off - that does not mean that Ukip are somehow ""radical"" or ""breaking out of the left-right system"", it means that *they have no actual principles anchoring them*, which is a very troubling thing for a political party as it points to the only thing beneath their policy being naked populism and the chasing of easy votes.

&gt;You are basing your whole argument on one game and the commentary of one analyst. 

No, this has been his entire Spurs career. He has rarely ever put himself on the right positions. 

&gt;Ade hasn't done shit for the past 3 years. Last year he had a run of 10 games where he played well then went back to his usual lazy play style. 

How very selective of you.  Those 10 games you cite are 10 games more than Soldado has performed in a Spurs shirt. Ade was our best player last season.  Your just being a hater. 

&gt; Ade gets called for being offsides at least 3 times a match because he is too lazy to get back. 

That's not true.  He tries to jump the line, but it's an effort to get into scoring position.   All the good strikers do it.  Kane gets called offside as well.   Calling that laziness speaks to your blind hatred of the man. 

&gt;All Ade has done in the past month is post on social media about how great his life is. 

So what?  Why the hell would you care about what anyone posts on social media.  Is that why you love Soldado? I'm guessing you're a Holtby fan as well. 


&gt;While Soldado has created great link up play and movement. You picked his worse game of the season as an example. 

You're delusional.  This game is emblematic of his entire 2 seasons.   He's been called out for this in the past as well many times.  He hasn't offered anything on the pitch his entire Spurs career.  His movement is awful.  He puts himself in the wrong positions.  His linkup play is a fantasy you've made up. 

&gt;Ade is a cancer to the club while Soldado actually acts like he wants to contribute.

You think he's a cancer.  His teammates voted him Co captain. Sure, he had poor form early in the season.  He had fucking MALARIA!!!! 

""acts like"" is irrelevant.  Results matter.   I don't care how nice you think Soldado is.   His play has been total shit and that's all that matters.

There are some decent bars and pubs down at the Shore too if you're staying near or fancy starting early in the day. As for cocktails, I couldn't tell you much beyond a lager shandy.

If you're dressing up the stag and want a better chance of getting in places then anywhere from Lothian Road through the Pubic triangle and down into the Grassmarket/Cowgate should see you right.

* The Chanter
* The Hanging Bat
* Western Bar/Burke &amp; Hare (stripclubs which open early afternoon)

As for ""culturally English"", culture is much more fluid than we tend to think. Most of those traditions you grew up with?

We tend to extrapolate from what we saw growing up, and assume our parents grew up with the same traditions.

No no, I didn't think you were. Sorry if it seemed like I was implying that or the wording read that way.

I really never had, but then again lots of people had heard of Savile while many others hadn't.

My own ""This isn't something we should talk about"" experience with Islam: I notice/noticed a distinct lack of women in public events or grouping of Muslims in the media. In general, that was. In fact I can often be heard, when there's a Muslim group on TV asking: ""Where are the women?"" 


I raised that on here following the deaths of 3 Muslim men up north during the riots, if you recall. Granted it was a fraught time, but there were no women anywhere: none in gathered crowds, none speaking to the media, none out of the street. Finally there were a few in the crowd at the mass service for the dead. Even one of the victims was described as being a father, with no mention of his partner at all. I don't recall the wording, but it was significant that she wasn't even hinted at.

That thread, which I tried to stress was wondering about the mentality that appears to restrict women in any degree, pondering if the women were 'choosing' that life etc. and not anywhere near right-wing driven, was generally downvoted and got one response from someone who said ""It's nothing to do with us, it's their culture"" which seemed to be missing the point entirely.",null,0,null,1425415486,null,0,false,0,cp3ao9c,null,t3_2xnw1n,null,t1_cp3ao9c,null,t1_cp2aaky,null,null,null,1427560938,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

He didn't say they had similar play styles, just similar physical attributes. This is the only time Dessaily is mentioned. He spends the rest of the article talking about his style not once comparing him to Desailly, yet people ignored that and called it a piece of garbage because he compares physical similarities between the two in one line.

What struck me, I suppose, was what hard work even the ""glory"" days were for most people. The North was about iron and coal and working till you bled in some cotton factory or mineshaft. It was a proud culture, to be sure, but only because in reality most people had so little and were exploited constantly essentially for the purposes of pulling material wealth out of the ground, or refining it into higher standard goods for export, not for the locals. It was a system based on utility - the utility of the infrastructure (ports and railways), the exploitation of the local populace for increasing demand, and the sheer amount of natural resources in the ground that technology kept inventing new ways to scrape up and feed into the machine that built the great Northern cities. It was not a romantic system, it was not a system that tolerated softness or stupidity, it was a system almost singleminded in its practicality and it prized common sense, and these traits sort of ingrained themselves into Northern culture.

So to answer your question - New Labour tried to pretend it was supporting the North with pretty new town centres, but all it ever really did was pump extra money from South to North. Industry must be based on something, in the Old North it was ready access to raw materials through the ports and the unashamed exploitation of the landscape. Government investment only works when it has something to kick start, something that was already there that people weren't making full utility of. Otherwise you end up simply wasting money supporting a declining, ageing, enfeebled client economy. The UK already have a client economy of sorts in Northern Ireland, part of the dividends of peace to stop them killing each other was to stuff Northern Ireland full of sinecures and cheap public sector jobs, 1 1/2 million people kept in relative prosperity purely for fear of the brutality of the Troubles returning. You don't want that and neither does the rest of the country.

The North needs something London cannot provide, that people will pay for. In today's economy that needn't be just steel, coal and [terrible food](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2009/oct/09/parmo-regional-snack-foods).

You cannot have multi-culturalism, because if their culture says rape of kafir girls is acceptable and we override it with our laws then they don't have their culture anymore.  Unless we start ignoring our culture for theirs, in fact I'd go as far to say that this is exactly what happened, in order to make the experiment work it *was* ignored. In some of the reports for example it literally says that the fear was it would cause friction in those communities.

We've basically been tolerating child rape for ideological reasons.

It's important because our laws are effectively a statement of culture. We as Britons have codified what we feel is acceptable and just behavior in them. We cannot compromise on this even slightly, not for a single scrap of paper or an entire religious text.

My point exactly, it takes more than just money. It takes a strong foundation which as you've just stated Chelsea already had, and it takes commitment from the owner.

I got a huge advance on wages from work to put towards the deposit - couldn't have done it otherwise - and my mortgage is about 30% more than my rent was.

There's a few Weatherspoons around if your wallet needs a break from the nice pubs, of them I'd suggest the Standing Order on George St. 

Not so much for clubs but I'm sure someone more into clubs can suggest a couple. 

If you're doing the token strip club thing, I'm aware of a few on Lothian Road and there's the ""pubic triangle"" which I think is about where Bread St meets Lauriston St.  I've never been into any but I don't get the impression that these are top-class establishments. 

Although Edinburgh is popular for stag dos and 7 isn't large as these things go, some places might not welcome a group males arriving all at once. If you do find it an issue, I expect the more obviously corporate looking establishments on the usual stag trails will be more accommodating, I'm thinking the likes of Frankenstein's and Espionage, both in the George IV Bridge area. That's also near the Grassmarket area, which personally I avoid but the stag dos often end up there, probably in no small part due to there being a number with late licences (3am, usually 1am elsewhere) in the area. 

btw there's also laserquest an easy walk from the centre, and paintball, karting etc further out. 

Also it's obligatory to walk up Arthur's Seat - moreso than the castle, which is quite expensive and IMHO not that great.  If the weather's clear both will give you some photos to support any pretence of a civilized sightseeing tour.

There's a certain attitude that rising house prices are 'good' and when the inevitable consequences happen all those sitting in their £300k house they paid £10k for go 'well if the youngsters wouldn't spend it all on booze.. not our fault..'

Supply doesn't seem to be a problem - there are loads of houses for sale around here.  I know a few that have been on sale for 2 years.  The problem is that houses aren't subject to market forces.. with most products if nobody is buying you drop the price until they do start buying.  With houses you just sit on it until 'the market recovers'.

Building more houses - as they're doing around here - solves nothing.  Nobody can afford them anyway.. all that'll happen is most of them will sit empty.

The degree is split into lots of different modules. You have a different tutor for each module. The quality of the materials, tutors and assignment differs quite massively between modules. Some are great whereas some can be a bit rubbish. Mostly though the tutors are pretty good and will happily e-mail you back quickly (some people phone but I've never done that). 

The computing modules can sometimes be a little contradictory as well. One will have one opinion whereas another module will will have another. This could be specific to computing though as it can be a subjective subject.

Exams are just like exams at school. You go to a venue, usually a hotel, and sit in silence. If the module has been running a few years then the questions are usually quite clear.

I started doing the degree to get a job as a programmer. I managed to do that a couple of years ago so I've just been working to finish it off to get the qualification which means some of the early enthusiasm has worn off.

null,false,skwinter,lfc68,,null,"Part of the reason that our system has been so effective though is the pressing from Lallana and Coutinho (or whoever's in those positions) but more importantly their ability to find space between the lines. Having those players in those positions gives us outlets from our defence and midfield into our attack, and Gerrard just does not move enough to make that work. In their most recent match against city Arsenal actually played a bank of 4 in midfield, a 4-1-4-1 with Coquelin as the holding role and I forget who in the middle (Ramsey and Wilshere?) and they completely eliminated the space that City typically operate in. While it's not the same as the way we play it would certainly cause more problems than anything United or West Brom would use. As for the magic of the final, while I tend to agree it's still not certain: see Gerrard's lacklustre performance against Everton a few weeks ago as an example. Not the same as a cup final, but that lethargic a performance I would never have expected to come from him against Everton.

As for using our width, yes we do have players keeping wide, but it's not for the purpose of putting in crosses, it's for opening space in the middle. In order to capitalize on this those attacking mids need to be mobile to exploit the spaces created, which Gerrard can do off and on, but still not the way Lallana, Coutinho or Sterling can. Stevie can play a vital role in dismantling any attempts by the opposition to park the bus, but his range of passing is less utilized in that position and he doesn't break up the play at all well. He's a great tackler, but that doesn't make him good at breaking up play. I'm less concerned about us being open defensively as much as I think it'll be too easy for Arsenal to maintain possession and we'll have difficulty transitioning into attack. Never mind the fact that absorbing pressure constantly is never a great way to go for a cup final. I don't see any formation against Arsenal where putting Stevie in the starting 11 isn't just trying to fit him in, rather than putting out our best 11.",null,0,null,1425417908,null,0,false,0,cp3c962,null,t3_2xrsby,null,t1_cp3c962,null,t1_cp3bgmu,null,null,null,1427561676,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

Because British Islam can't have it both ways.

That there's a duty to stand up to extremism and to fully recognize the horrors being carried out, not just in the name of, but because of religion.

No, I'm not saying that I blame every Muslim, but I do think that religious people have responsibilities. That it's *not* enough to stay silent.

Yeah, this is what I am doing currently, and I would not recommend it. Basically you get even less contact than at the OU (no tutors) and are on your own. I get a subject guide in the post, some past papers to download and then 9 months later an exam. Unless you are crazy disciplined and like figuring out problems 100% on your own I would not recommend.

Would be really interested to hear what contact you get and how much time you can spend talking to / emailing / getting feedback from the tutor and what that is like, if you don't mind asking.

I could be wrong, but I remember the team being really well balanced and extremely fluid. We had a lot of great players in their prime that year and it often felt like Ancelotti was just happy to let them do their thing and not micro-manage.

As for our competitors, it was us vs United for almost the entire season. No one else was ever really in the race. Between the two of us, it came down to the last day. Drogba and Rooney were also neck and neck for the golden boot that season. I remember this because on the last day, we won a penalty for our first or second goal and Drogba wanted to take the pen to add to his goal tally, but Lampard was the designated taker and wouldn't let him.

But Chelsea's financial backing was to a far larger degree than either of those. There is no evidence of Henry Norris investing any money towards Arsenal to carry out transfers and improve the squad, it is only reported that he bribed the league to get Arsenal promoted. This does not put Arsenal at a financial advantage compared to other teams in the division, unlike Chelsea who massively did under Abramovich. The appointment of H Chapman was what changed Arsenal and led The Gunners to dominate football in the 1930s and this was after Norris left. Chapman made Arsenal successful, not Norris. The second-world war put any of Arsenal's financial advantage (if there was any) to a halt anyway.

I don't know enough about Gibson to make a judgement. 

&gt;it takes more than just money.

Of-course, but money is without doubt the most important factor with Chelsea. Arsenal appointed Chapman, Graham and Wenger without much financial advantages and their footballing brains and skill brought success to the club - finance wasn't drastically needed. Ferguson transformed United after a few years and then had huge amounts of money to invest and keep United at the very top and consistently win titles when Mourinho couldn't (or at least didn't look like winning a title for two years between 06-08 despite absolutely millions being invested.) Avram Grant managed to get Chelsea to the Champions League Final which Mourinho couldn't accomplish, and Ancelotti was very good for a season then drastically underperformed (which is a running pattern with City/Chelsea in the last 5 years). Scolari was a horrible appointment, Villas-Boas was a poor choice, Di Matteo won the UCL and FA Cup. Managers have been very inconsistent at Chelsea and this is another aspect of 'running the club', the small loyalty has definitely harmed Chelsea IMO. Let's remember Chelsea still only sit on 4 titles, which seemed highly unlikely in 2006. Chelsea are run well, and Mourinho plays a big part in this, but Abramovich's investment is so much more prominent and important than your examples.

League/City/Owner patience is nothing to do with the football side of things anyway.

The thing I found last time I was looking for work (which I concede was ten years ago) was that the general ""how to find a job""-advice available to jobseekers was complete crap. 

""Send as many CVs to as many people as possible"" is rubbish. ""Physically visit as many companies as you can"" is not much better. There are a lot of extra details you have to consider, and if you don't consider every damn one of them you're wasting your time. 

In brief, I'd suggest something like this:

  - Decide what sort of job it is you're looking for.
  - Write a functional (**not** a pure chronological) CV based around this. 
    - A functional CV spends most of the first page focusing on your skills and achievements; the description of your life so far is relegated to the bare minimum. Skills and achievements come first, followed by work experience, followed by education. 
  - Get a list of companies in your area who might be hiring someone with who has your skills. (The easiest way to do this is to make a list of appropriate industries then get a list of all companies in that industry in your area. Such lists are easy to get hold of online - they're often sold for marketing purposes - or your local library can probably help).
  - For each possibly interesting company, identify the person who would be in charge of your department by name. This can take a fair bit of work, particularly as many companies these days have strict policies to refuse to give out names, but that's where things like LinkedIn come in handy.
  - Approach that person directly - either with an email or (gasp!) a letter. The text must NOT be copy/pasted; it must be written specifically for the company you're approaching. Doesn't need to be War and Peace; a single paragraph where you say ""I note you're doing X and Y; I have particular experience in this as you can see from my attached CV"". Tailor the CV if necessary.
  - Keep a record of every company you've approached, along with a copy of the email and CV you sent them. Make sure you bring two copies to any interview.
  - For Heaven's sake, do NOT approach HR directly unless you're looking to work in HR! Their job is to minimise the risk of being sued by an employee, and the easiest way to do that is not to employ someone in the first place. 


There's a reason you do it this way around. 

At any given point in time, many managers are thinking to themselves ""I could just do with getting someone else on board to do this..."".  Quite often, they'll be mulling this over for months before they discuss it with HR - if they ever do. And until such time as they discuss it with HR, all HR will do is bin any CVs that come in.

A similar technique should be used on recruitment websites - identify and snipe interesting opportunities, don't go in with a machine-gun approach.

You'll know when you're doing it right because you'll start to see radically different results to your initial approaches - you won't get a job straight away but you'll get far more polite replies and informal sniffing-around type phone conversations than you ever did with a scattergun approach.

Don't be afraid to alter the technique if it's not working for you. It's completely bonkers to keep using the same technique day in day out when you've established that it doesn't work.",null,0,null,1425418621,null,0,false,0,cp3cq7s,null,t3_2xry4r,null,t1_cp3cq7s,null,t1_cp2x7am,null,null,null,1427561898,null,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

Mané, who I admittedly doubted earlier in the season, has saved us on numerous occasions, today no different. We have a long time before Chelsea and I think Koeman needs to shake something up. Maybe starting Long and Pellè together, as Long's workrate might help create more chances in a two striker system. Durijic looked shakey at times and against weaker defences I can see how he has been successful in the past. The Premier League is a whole other beast, however, and I hope he can be successful.

null,false,reductios,null,null,null,"&gt;The worst case of this I saw was the analysis one university team did where they analysed the cost and benefits of immigrants to the exchequer and reported that EU immigrants provided a £4bn surplus. They completely ignored the £117bn loss they found from non-EU immigrants in the press release and buried it deep inside the report.

I know the paper you are talking about and your criticism of it isn't fair. The figure you have quoted is a very misleading number, although you need a little understanding of economics to understand why.

The government was running a deficit and so if you looked at the total cost to the exchequer of native British exchequers, you would also come up with a huge number. However neither of these would be all that meaningful except if you compare the average cost of a native to an immigrant, which is what they did in the conclusions of the report. 

Even a well-run economy will run a deficit over the long run which means that if you just look at the net figures gives the impression that almost everyone is a drain on the exchequer. However, in reality, everyone is contributing to increasing economic output which allows the government to run a deficit.

We were pale in our last meeting away against Burnley. They created more chances and had more shots, including one in the wood work by Ings. Luckily we got away with 3 points. Much has happened since our last meeting, our lads are working more as a team and the confidence level is high. The players believe in the new formation and many in our squad has evolved into great and solid players. The squad rotation is even working well.

&gt;Farage is all about his ""People's Army"", his supporters, but is quick to disclaim their actions when they appear to hold unpleasant beliefs. He can't have it both ways.

Can't he? There's an argument I could get behind somewhere in this, but you're not making it- Farage doesn't have any more control over the actions of fringe elements of his party than, say, Clegg does over the LDs. I think it's illustrative of the sort of person UKIP tend to attract, but there have clearly been great strides taken to *try* and modernise the party of late.

If a business can save a lot of money relocating outside of London and still have the same international access the attraction of the place will diminish. 

Why do you think computers would have that effect?

If anything computers and global communication are what has created London as it currently stands. The evidence so far seems to be that that technology actually drives people into clusters. Remove people in the same job from geographical constraints, and they don't spread apart, they move together - businesses come to find talent, skilled people come to find jobs, opportunities for learning, and ways to spend their money, and capital moves to find both, which forms a self-reinforcing cycle. The same has happened for finance and for IT, both driven by developments in communications technology.

Generally the first exam results you are giving will only be provisional. Results can change after you are told them, they are usually just the raw initial results to give you an idea of where you are. At the end of the year an exam board will meet to review results and this is when mitigating circumstances will be taken in to consideration. 

Generally students may not realise this as schools try to ensure results do not change after the provisional results are released, and they are only changed as a result of the exam board meeting.

So the advice you were given probably isn't as unhelpful as you think it is, if you've been told to put in for it then do. Remember it benefits the school/course for the students to do well, and if putting in for MC can change you from a fail to a pass it is definitely worth it.

have you seen UKIP and the nonesense they spew all the time, crying they are being discriminated against by the media and lefties and how being a white male man in this country is a death sentence or do the muslims have a monopoly on victimhood?  
  
You said British Islam and European Islam! care to explain the difference between the two. am aware of wahaabis, salafis, ahmeddiyya, Shia's, Hanafis etc but not them.

what? not to be treated like a criminal or terrorist at **home** when a war is going on aboard in country they have never visited or speaks a language they dont understand or people they have never met. I had no idea you couldn't have the benefit of the doubt like other communities get.
 
&gt;If they think that an attack or insult against any Muslim is an affront to every good Muslim, then they should also accept that problems being caused by Islam are, to an extent, the responsibility of every Muslim

So which is it? Are they a tool for 'mass genocide and like to cause human extinction' or 'no real threat'?

They can't be both, and you can't simply flip-flop between the two as it suits your political narrative.

NB. I'm not discussing the morality, merits or efficacy of  the MAD policy, just the utterly bizarre concept that our nuclear subs are capable of being both 'no threat to Russia' and 'capable of mass genocide'.

The problem is though, that it's the sharp decline in income and investment in the 80's that made most of the rest of the country shit, while London experienced a boom that it's still riding.

It's true that London is the new powerhouse of the nation. It's true that London is a global centre of trade and banking. It's true that it naturally does and should attract investment.

But it's also true that London has a duty of care to the rest of the country. It's high time the wealth was shared. 

Sure, places like Manchester, Cardiff, Liverpool, Newcastle, Birmingham have had a good share of the pot, but it's still an insulting pittance when you look at what London attracts. 

We need proper investment in the tertiary Towns...Norwich, Canterbury, Doncaster, Middlesbrough.....someone with the purse strings needs to sit down, write out a list of places that they think are so shit nobody should live there and make them better.

While the money may not be amazing, it will be a regular wage with good holiday and it still allows you to utilise your skills, and there's still room for progression. When headteachers ask you about adding value to the school (in terms of what you'll bring other than just your lessons), music is easily the best thing for that - there's tons of opportunities to share your knowledge through music groups and ensembles and shows etc. I don't know if you'd enjoy running them but some people certainly do.

And I think it's incredibly inspiring to have someone who's been out and plied their trade in the real world teach you, rather than someone who came straight out of teaching training aged 23.  

Peripatetic is similar, although it depends on which instrument you teach to be honest. Guitar you probably won't have a problem getting students (there's always huge waiting lists), and you may well be able to earn a very respectable amount (private fees can often be £40/hour+). But for most instruments I think a lot of them rely jointly on their partner's income, or on being session musicians too. 

I'd advise the former personally. Being a teacher has its pros and cons and ultimately it's down to you whether you think you can do it. But it's certainly a path Id go down if I were you.

I think the sterling amount of Chelsea's financial backing is largely immaterial to this discussion. Football inflation is clearly a thing, and was before Abramovich bought Chelsea. Globalisation of the game in the 80s and 90s is to thank for that. Even the tiny clubs today spend amounts that the richest back in the day would find ridiculous, even with regular inflation taken into account.

That said comparing Norris to Abramovich can only be taken so far. Transfers were much less a part of the game back in the 1910s clearly, but that doesn't mean his financial clout didn't make a difference. Arsenal were nearly broke when he bought them, he cleared his debts, presumably contributed a lot to business side of things (either directly or through deals) and moved them into a shiny new stadium, all of which results in more dosh in Arsenal coffers, which means better players, better wages, and as Soccernomics does a good job illustrating the link, more success. 

Of course another effect of Norris' investment is the hiring of Chapman. In this regard I would strongly draw parallel to Chelsea and Abramovich. Chelsea won nothing under Ranieri despite Roman's millions, and our performance in between Mourinho eras (Ancelotti aside) has been mediocre at best. I would say the exact same thing, that in both occasions, 2004 and 2014, It is Mourinho's arrival that takes Chelsea to the next level. In his first spell Mourinho took Chelsea to one of the best clubs in Europe, a status we have long since lost since his departure, and now he seems to be doing it again. I suspect that with a long spell now at the club we're going to be seeing a much more consistent level of performance from Chelsea.

On the other hand I think your statement that Jose failed to bring consistent success to Chelsea is crazy. He went one full season without winning the title, and even then he won the FA Cup, even Ferguson went seasons (more than one in a row even) without winning the title or anything. To draw conclusions from that is incredibly speculative. The fact that Avram Grant almost took Chelsea back to the title and Champions League (with Mourinho's team) shows that he could easily have come back that season had he stayed. One could equally speculate that they could have gone further and won both had he stayed. It's ridiculous and speculative, but no more so than your own comment.

Ancelotti I would say the same, his ""underperformance"" was coming second in the league, very harsh criticism, especially when you look at the downward trend we took with the managers after him. I'd dare say that the difference in success between Jose/Carlo and all the other terrible managers we've had has been one of Roman's biggest learning points, and is probably why he went back to Jose once he realised how important it really is to have a top manager. I agree switching manager so frequently harmed the team, but if nothing else it seems to have taught Roman the value of picking a good one and sticking with him.

At the end of the day my point still stands, your comment that Chelsea's success is solely due to the sugar daddy is very simplistic. Many clubs recently and through history have spent like crazy only to have very sparing success, Chelsea in the non Jose/Carlo years included. Clearly money has a big impact, and again most of the game's elite clubs stand as proof of that, but equally important to Chelsea or anyone else's success is talent. Chelsea could easily be a money splashing flop like so many other clubs, but they have a great manager, and they have immensely talented people behind the scenes who (lately at least) having been pulling off some extraordinary business and investing very well in infrastructure. 

If you doubt me then go ask QPR, Cardiff, Hull, Monaco, Real Madrid in the 2000s, Inter Milan, Blackburn in the 90s after their one title win, Leeds United, Malaga, Hearts, how their ""buying success"" strategy is working out for them.

He also says Aguero likes to play deeper than the highest striker which I don't agree with either, one of the main changes Pellegrini made was making Dzeko/Aguero as 9/10 respectively into both players (or Negredo who usually started last season as he settled into his formation) sitting on the shoulders of the defenders and Pellegrini has I think got the best form out of Aguero in this role

I also don't really agree that Aguero and Dzeko are a good partnership, neither play together particularly well, the only good strike partner we've had for Aguero was Negredo - even Aguero and Tevez didn't really work.

Dzeko is good but for a player of his size and stature he isn't much of a target man, he doesn't throw his weight around enough and really get at defenders whereas hopefully Bony will and that's the thinking behind signing him so Aguero gets a bit more space to shit people up.

So I think in summary Michael Cox should go back to his little diagrams.

edit: sorry I just re-read it. I don't really agree about Fernandinho not being good in that role either! And De Jong being underrated is complete rubbish, he was massively overrated just because he'd occassionly maim some French jobber, it was Gareth Barry we should've never gotten rid of. If we'd kept him, we could play him behind Yaya and Fernandinho in the big games and we'd be loads more solid, he'd probably still be alright there now because he wouldn't have to run!

I was doing a feasibility study of moving to London and saw the price of a 12 month mainline season ticket from Bethnal Green to Liverpool Street.  For a journey that takes less than ten minutes, they were looking for over £900 and an Oyster travel card isn't a whole world cheaper either.

A friend of mine lives in Watford and takes the train into Euston for work - she reckons it's about £25-30 a week.

In 2009/2010 my standard weekly shop in a large inner-city Tesco Metro (i.e. fewer discounts and artificially jacked prices) would set me back roughly £35 a week, up to £40 if I splurged and bought stuff I didn't need.

Like-for-like items bought in a 2015 out-of-town Tesco Extra?  Usually £50-60.  Food prices have definitely inflated, no doubt about it.

&gt; A 10k deposit on a 200k house - a 5% mortgage - is probably going to get you unfavourable terms, at least from most lenders.

""Police turned up in full riot gear, I originally tried to diffuse the situation by politely reasoning with officers. One was particularly flirty with me and spoke to me about his job etc.

Things eventually got quite heated as they were provoking the crowd by shoving us and making dogs bark at us. We couldn't leave as we were trapped in a compound.

They eventually began trying to chase us, I was helping a couple of 14 year old girls jump the fence when an officer smashed my arm with his baton.

I fell to the floor in pain and then he prised my legs open with his left hand and repeatedly beat me in the vagina with his baton as I screamed. I was hit at least 6 times while he screamed ""I'm going to see to it you get punished, you filthy whore!""

After he handcuffed me, he forced me to stand despite me being in too much pain to stand. I realised it was the same officer that had been very flirty with me.
I begged for medical attention as I could see blood seeping through my trousers and the pain was intense, but he told me I wasn't allowed any help at all and he informed other officers to deny me any medical attention. He did not have his number on display an refused to give me his name when I asked.
He continued to force me to stand by holding my handcuffs up, despite me almost crying in agony asking to just let me sit down as my legs were too weak from the beating.

After I arrived at custody, I was refused medical help for 4-5 hours and when the doctor eventually saw me, she was shocked and horrified at my injuries and confirmed this was definitely a sexually motivated injury. She told the officers I needed to be sped to hospital to be investigated for internal bleeding.

When seen at a&amp;e, the doctor said there was no internal bleeding but I did have a severally bruised urethra and multiple intimate injuries.

i do agree, part of our recent success has been based on the pressing of lallana and couto, but if stevie were to come in, he would really play more of a second striker/second cf role. stevie will press and harry, and he can definitely put in a tackle. i would point to gerrard's performance vs tottenham as evidence that he can get a job done. there is evidence that stevie can adn cannot play in this system. with a month of fitness conditioning and rest, i would be remiss in saying that i have a hard time believing stevie wont' be able to give an equally effective effort once a week/bi-weekly. 

onto your width comment, yeah we don't cross, but that's the point i was trying to make. our width opens up the middle of the pitch and provides outlets for our back 3 and 2 shuttlers.

anyways i don't know that we'll ever really see eye to eye on this, but stevie is definitely one of the squads best XI still. on form, no way, but in general for sure. it will be interesting to see how this month away from the squad has impacted him...he should be VERY well rested and will surely give everything to the cause. now that we're at 1 match a week, stevie will not fatigue at all and i can see him playing week in and week out. BR isn't afraid to bench stevie, he benched him for his last opportunity ever to play against real madrid, which leads me to believe that BR still rates stevie's contributions highly.

They aren't illiterate dumbfucks, they're disillusioned university graduates who are looking for something to stand for, a cause to fight for. What does modern Britain stand for? Getting on with life without offending people? Hardly something a firebrand graduate is going to get behind. 

There's also the issue that a lot of the primary and secondary education that some people are getting amounts more to brainwashing than anything else. Saudi Arabia has perfected the art of funding extreme religious education across the world, which is why so many young Muslims now have such a fundamentalist interpretation of the religion. The problem could get worse with each generation, not better. The 1st generation immigrants know first hand why the UK is a better place to live than their former home, and they are usually mature and comfortable enough in their religious identity not to be interested in the new, more extreme teachings.

This country needs to stand up for its values more, it needs to be unafraid to say that we are one of the safest countries in the world, one of the best places to live in the world, and that is because of our western way of life and rule of law. The UK is objectively better than every single Islamist country in the world, and it seems a lot of highly educated people have forgotten that. We need to be shutting out foreign funding from religious zealots. 

There's a propaganda war going on, and we aren't even defending ourselves.

null,false,rembrant1,null,null,null,"Okay, lets take a step back because I think we are both misunderstanding each other. Right now our argument is basically who is more worthless, Soldado or Ade. I agree that we need to get rid of them both as soon as possible. Our disagreement is that you think Ade works harder off the ball then Soldado. I strongly disagree and if you look at distance traveled per game, it would not support your theory that Ade moves a lot without the ball. Now I know that doesn't tell us anyting about the quality of the movement, but is shows that Soldado working harder off the ball. 
I dont have a blind hatred for Ade, I use to love him and was ecstatic when he signed on Loan for Spurs. But over the years, I grew tired of waking up on game day, praying ""I hope Ade decides to show up and play today"". Ade is a far more superior talent than Soldado and they are not even comparable when both are on form. I dont know if I have even watch a Valencia match while soldado was there, so I am not a big fan of his. But because of his actions on and off the Pitch he has lead me, and many other spurs fans, to believe that he actually is striving to get better. Where Ade lashes out at fans when he is frustrated. Ade also undermined AVB when he was here and that started my dislike for him. But my last point, why I brought up the Social Media earlier is because two weeks ago Ade posted on instagram about how great his life is right now. A Spurs fan commented ""Sitting on your ass making millions, life must be great"" (Something along those lines) and Ade personally replied to the post saying ""I know life couldn't be better"". It was the only post he replied too. So that adds a bit more fuel to the fire and which makes be believe he is content sitting on the bench until we can find him a club that will pay him similar money.

Disagree, honestly. When he rushes off the line it's calculated as part of early pressing, and often leads to a successful tackle or interception. The wing back sometimes has to sprint back to provide cover, but that's what they are there for. The movement is part of the tactical system and he's doing it perfectly in my opinion. There have been a couple of mistakes, such as not tracking Dzeko's run on Sunday, but in general I think he's been amazing.

I do believe it's a cultural problem. Why do we even have one person going in this day an age who can be so isolated in his own community that he thinks sex with 13 year old girls is OK, and then have a judge go along with it? They're just carrying on business as usual as if if it were a microcosm of the countries of their ancestors. The worse thing is that some of them are 2nd or 3rd generation, so clearly they're not integrating at all. 

We've gone in blindly assuming that those who choose to come to this country will somehow magically start abiding by our values the second they set foot on our soil, without enforcing or teaching those values in anyway shape or form. They've then gone on to pass on those same values to their children to the point where it is now entrenched. Without a real crackdown we won't shift it, and it is going to be a hellish exercise requiring a huge amount of manpower and resources and for what?

&gt;I don't think you can claim people as being automatically 'self righteous' just because they have a belief in something. 

Not what I claimed.  But many many SJWs *are* self-righteous.  Practically by definition, they're a group who wish to impose their morality on others.  But they see that as a virtue!  They think it's their duty to tell other people what is or isn't morally acceptable and to shame those of us who don't live up to their vaulted standards.  

&gt;I mean are you not yourself, self righteous over your disdain for social progressives?

Perhaps.  However, to give myself credit, I think I'm much more aware of the problems inherent to self-righteous certainty and I *try* to be a practicing fallibilist (in which I am fallible).

&gt;Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that you're a fedora wearing neck beard. 

You see - I actually do object to this insult.  Why?  Because it's an attempt to cast those you disagree with as unattractive loners, whereas 'Social Justice Warrior' is at least an attempt to mock the beliefs as opposed to the appearance of the people involved.  I suspect you think me a hypocrite, but I think calls of 'Fedora wearing neckbeard' etc. are little more than bullying.

null,false,lokkenmor,Scotland,Suzuki V-Strom DL650 K7,null,"TL;DR - Based on the video, I don't want to see any of your content anywhere. Unless you go and start your own sub called /r/cuntishriding. Your attitude towards other road users and your selfish, thrill seeking riding has no place on public roads. If you want to kill yourself you go right ahead and do it and do it on a closed circuit without putting everybody else at risk. Oh, and the blurring of the speedo or not (coward), there's more than enough evidence in that video for the police to charge you with dangerous driving. The speed you're doing may be a contributory factor but it's not required to secure a prosecution.

Wall of text/breakdown of the video below.

---

You didn't do a good enough job of blurring your speedo for the first thirty seconds so I'm going to take this opportunity to call you out on your cuntish riding.

In the first thirty second of the video, right after you say, ""Oh, look a thirty zone"" you overtake those and accelerate to SIXTY ONE miles per hour. And I know this, because that's the bit you didn't blur out. There's a prime example of you being a cunt.

Next thirty seconds, after bitching at the car for not indicating you overtake him, coming (what looks like) dangerously close to him, on the exit of a roundabout with (what looks like) a restricted view of what's ahead of you. First, you giving someone attitude because they didn't indicate, that's pretty aggressive from someone who rides like a fucking arse. And then there's you dashing about like Billy fucking Whizz not thinking you're doing anything wrong and that shit won't happen to you. Strike two on the cunt-o-meter for you.

Next forty seconds, you whinging about a lorry ahead of you speeding. And you're right, lorries not being able to break in good time will wreck some fucking lives. **And so will a bike**. If you ride a like a cunt - and from the first minute forty of the video I have evidence enough to presume that you do - and you can't stop in time because you're going to fast and you hit a pedestrian you will seriously injure or kill htem just as readily as you will seriously injure or kill yourself. I refer you to the [BBC News article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-31715284) of the hit and run. That rider was driving like a cunt, just like you seem to be in your video.

&gt; ""I might mentally scar someone by splattering myself on their bonnet. But that massive lorry bastard... is really gonna ruin somebodies day"".

Yeah, and the mental scars that some has to live with for the rest of their life because your shitty riding left you a bloody streak on the front of your car is less pain and suffering than having to live without a loved one if the lorry takes them out. Bit hey, if it ruins my fun the IDGAF. #yolo... Cunt.

I'll give you, you're not a complete tube. You stayed clear of that bus well enough. Obviously not that big a fan of making yourself into a collection of guts on the road then. Self-preservation's still ticking along in you.

2:55 to 3:00 | You come off that roundabout and **accelerate** past that white SUV as you're coming up to a pedestrian crossing. Thank you for making my point about your reckless driving could lead to an accident with a pedestrian for me. And I assume you at least know that road somewhat since your chat tells me you've been down it a couple of times before.

3:05 to 3:10 | ""Some dickhead looking dickhead needs to cross"". I know, fuck him for needing to cross the road and not just running out in front of all the traffic. And fuck him for getting in the way of your speeding around the town like an arse and having fun. Just another example of your cuntish attitude.

4:15 to 4:25 | Not looking ahead and thinking about that bus ahead of you, as evidenced by your ""Ehhh, uhhhhhhh"" noise. And then weaving from overtaking to undertaking while still travelling faster than all the other traffic around you. Like a complete tool.

4:55 to 5:00 | Overtaking in the face on oncoming traffic, ignoring the right turn only marking on the road. All after coming off you ""Oh, the video was sped up"". Bollocks. You're a fucking coward. You ride like a cunt, but you're too much of scared wee laddie to deal with the consequences of getting caught. You're pathetic.

5:15 to 5:30 | ""Most considerate people when they see a motorcycle in their rear-view just get the fuck out the way because... they're going slower than most motorcycles are"". No, most people get out of the way of a fucking dickhead, because they don't want to be involved in whatever fucking dickheadery tends to transpire around said fucking dickhead. Usually because of said dickheads fucking dickheaded actions.

+5s | ""Or at least slower than me"". There's the fucking crux of it.

6:10 to 6:25 | While you're trying to impart some halfway decent knowledge about slippery road conditions, you fucking skite past numerous cars over- and undertaking and then you fucking squeeze yourself in between that dark coloured beamer and that white Nissan ?Micra? with L-plates. Unbelievable. While it's raining, while you talking about slippery road conditions, but have you modified your riding to those conditions that you profess are so troublesome. By all and actual fuck you have.

7:10 to 7:15 | Aye, that rain bringing out all that shit on the road. Nice to see you've toned down your *completely reasonable use of the accelerator* &lt;/s&gt; to account for that.

7:25 to 7:30 | More of that I'm just gonna drive in between these cars while going faster than then because ""I NEED TO KEEP MY VISOR CLEAR, HURR DURR"". Wait, what? ""Lane discipline""? What?

7:58 to 8:12 | That silver car. That is you. That is what your riding looks like to me, and everyone else you fucking sped on by in that video. You've just traded four wheel for two. And you have the fucking audacity to call him a cunt like you're somehow better than he is. You're a fucking joke.

8:15 | ""Fuck this"" as you slip between the coach and the car. That's pretty much your entirely attitude to riding, and other road users, isn't it?

8:24 | ""And fuck this"". You're just making my point for me.

9:00 | ""You wanna race"". Are you for fucking real? Just when I thought you couldn't *be* any more of a cunt you manage to step it up a gear. Not content with being a cunt by yourself, you need a fucking friend to be a cunt along with you so that you can multiply each other cuntitude.

null,false,Glitter-Herpes,eng-lancashire,Wigan - Land of the Pies,null,"Not at all. Different places have different ways. Different schools will have their own procedures to apply for Safeguarding reasons. Safeguarding is taken 100% seriously and it matters. If a school's advert states ""No CV. Application form only"" and you send them a CV, you might as well have Facebook messaged a teacher going ""Can I have a job at your school?"" Their particular application form is designed with Safeguarding in mind. It matters that you adhere to their strict rule(s) on how to apply.   

Think of it as submitting a manuscript to a publishing house: if they say the font size has to be 12 make sure it's 12. It'll be binned and not even read if it's not.  

As for the first part to your question: on education sites like TES they are advertised like that, though knowledge of curricula is a given and measured by the application and interview.    

If a teaching job literally just asked for a CV then your CV would have to be about 10 pages long. Each job comes with a specification on qualities, knowledge and experience. Each one is labelled ""Essential"" or ""Preferable"" or similar wording. In the application you fill out, you have to reference each ""Essential"" (and ""Preferable"" for an even better application) and write about it.  

Oh, and a little bit of interesting information: if an ""Essential"" person specification is ""Really good sense of humour"" and ""Patience"" then the school is most likely a shit-hole full of incredibly challenging kids. It's weird to specifically specify those things because it's a given anyway. It's weird how you can partially judge a school based on the person spec.
