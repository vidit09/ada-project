They could have had nice TVs and Sky and mobiles from a time they had more money. With Sky and mobiles you're locked in to a contract so if you lose your job, tough shit you still have to pay it. The TV shows and news channels don't do a good job of showing you the millions of people who live in poverty and can't scrape by on the pittance they receive. My mum brought me and my sister up alone all her life and she was fucking poor, we didn't have a nice TV or anything. We had Sky because my mum found the odd job cleaning caravans for £1 per caravan or bar work in the evenings but without government assistance we wouldn't have even afforded dinner. I remember when we moved house through the council we had stone floors for 2 years because my mum has to scrimp and save to buy carpet... The govt didn't help because my mum made the choice to move quicker so me and my sister didn't have to share a room...

I was on job seekers allowance for a year, the £57 a week I got was fucking shit. I couldn't afford a mobile, food and rent, travel, interview clothes, a computer or Internet to find a job. I had to turn up to an interview for a job I really wanted in a stained shirt once because I couldn't afford the fucking launderette and the shitty washing machine my landlord provided had broke. When I got evicted for missing rent because the council fucked up my payments, who did the court side with? My landlord because they agreed I should have saved or prepared ahead! How was I meant to be doing that when I had no fucking money. That left me with a CCJ which means I now can't get a credit card and I'm struggling again on minimum wage. When I was on JSA the jobcentre had the audacity to suggest I work 2 weeks unpaid at Poundland. Being on some benefits is akin to slavery and it is insulting and for you to suggest most people are 'living it up'. 

Don't forget that more benefits actually go UNCLAIMED than what is lost by benefit fraud. Don't forget that tax fraud and evasion is something like 20x higher in value than what is paid out in welfare.

There's a requirement that the job must be advertised in a particular way and for sponsors to demonstrate that there are no suitable settled workers to fill the post (this is totally reasonable, I have no problem with this). However the sponsorship can only be done by those companies who are in [the list of approved sponsors](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-licensed-sponsors-workers), massively reducing the no. of companies that a non-EU skilled worker can apply to. And also there's this cap now.

Same goes for those foreign non-EU students who graduate with masters or phds from top unis, even Oxbridge, Imperial, UCL, etc. However, they're exempted from the labour market test so in the short 4 months period at the end of their study, they can try to look for jobs (PhDs get another extra year though). 

The current UK immigration system is passively hostile towards non-EU skilled workers, where the message to *keep out* is not written anywhere but can be read by anyone. I predict the number of foreign non-EU students -- who pay a shitload of cash to study here and basically subsidises British students -- to continue dropping as they head to alternative countries e.g. Canada, australia, that are more welcoming towards them. This might lead to an increase in tuition fees as universities struggle to make up for that loss.

And let's not even talk about migration for non-EU spouse of British citizens. It's generally easier for them to both leave the country and settle elsewhere.",null,0,null,1431770546,null,0,1431787588,0,crawkw4,null,t3_3658m5,null,t1_crawkw4,null,t1_cravx29,null,null,null,1433094239,null,32,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,32,null

null,false,davegod,uk,United Kingdom,null,"I recall an interesting case study - I'm a bit vague on the details as I read it probably 15 years or so ago - about Honda (IIRC) in UK car manufacturing around the late 1980s or so. I'm fairly sure it was Honda but may be getting my wires crossed with another study about their partnership with Rover, which has a number of lessons on very similar theme. Anyway -

They had this car plant, I think they'd inherited it through an acquisition, which was doing terribly. This was not at all unusual, UK car manufacturing was renown at that time for having *terrible* productivity per worker and this was consistent across all car manufacturers. It was generally accepted that the UK manufacturing workforce had poor productivity and this was clearly evidenced from results. 

So the Honda bosses sent their man in to have a look at this dog of a plant and this was seen to surely be the precursor for de-investment and shutting the plant, as were the intentions of other foreign manufacturers in UK. What he found was a badly out of date factory in terms of capital investment and management practice. Honda invested massively and brought in their own managers, turning the plant into one of the most efficient in the world. 

Unfortunately when British managers read ""In Britain we produce about a quarter less for every hour we work than countries like America or Germany"", the typical thinking is they need to push workers harder and invest less.

The tories never actually managed a surplus as high as labour in modern times.

I don't think cutting the deficit is a bad idea, but I think it should be done by responsible investment, not cuts, and increased taxation to reap the rewards of the reinvestment and allow for more. If the deficit is reduced by making more money instead of cutting then it is more sustainable, cut cut cut just leads to breaking point where spending has to go back up and the income is even lower.

If government considered return on investment instead of just seeing the immediate cost it would work, it is just a shame that no government will plan ahead any longer than the next general election.

&gt; Maybe it seems mercenary, but surely the idea is to win elections. The problem with Labour chasing all those SNP and PC seats is that they will lose seats in England and in all likelihood won't even get the seats they were chasing anyway.

Winning elections is your bottom line huh? Commit whatever ideological double-standards or sacrifice however many convictions but as long as Labour wriggles its way into office that's all that matters? Clearly we're at an impasse here on whether Labour believes in anything other than acquiring power...  By 'PC' I assume you mean 'Politically Correct'. What are you trying to say here? Openly confronting austerity and instead going for a more economically sound plan of stimulus spending is politically correct? For someone chastising others for 'ideological pigeonholing' this is a laughable statement to make. What lost Labour seats in England was indulging the Tory economic line that 'Labour's profligate spending is the root cause of all our troubles' rather than confronting it and showing it to be the farce of an argument is actually is! 

&gt; Talking about austerity is completely irrelevant. By 2020 it won't be an issue. You can't choose a leader for the 2020 election based on the 2015 election campaign. 

How can it be irrelevant if the Tories are committed to making greater cuts in this Parliament than they did in the last Parliament?

&gt; Do people in Labour's northern heartland sit around waiting for the pits to re-open and the return of Scargill and Kinnock? Do they fuck, so stop treating them as if any shift away from a hard left position will result in haemorrhaging votes to UKIP.

Neither do they enjoy choosing between 'austerity' and 'austerity-lite'.

Just another point to add to that;

While many countries will lock down roads and have a huge motorcade roll through for VIPs (especially heads of state), in the UK (especially London) the police tend to have 1 or 2 cars with motorcycle outriders blocking traffic. The idea is a small, discrete, but constantly rolling convoy using is far less obvious than a big bugger off motorcade.
Like another user said, one minute things are normal, next minute VIP rolls by, minute after it's normal again.

The interesting thing is they rarely use sirens, preferring to use whistles. Apparently the idea is whistles are equally notable within a small range, outside of that range no one will take notice.

Just watching City grasp the victory from the jaws of defeat, I sat there, mouth wide open, blown away at what an incredible piece of history I had just watched.

I didn't know the first thing about the takeover.  I honestly didn't really know who Manchester City was.  But in that moment, I instantly connected to City, and Aguero immediately became my favorite player.  I don't even have jerseys of players from my favorite baseball team, but I bought an Aguero jersey!  Even if they never won another title, I wanted to cheer for this team.

null,false,Huwbacca,null,null,null,"It must be very dependent on schools then. I went to school in what is probably, the closest UK school to France so we had quite regular exposure to the language. I had full secondary education in French, German and Latin up to GCSE yet the knowledge I have retained in those is fairly slim. My german runs out around ""Meine hamster in meine schlaftsack ist gestorben"" and how to order a beer. I will say that I really do value my latin education and wish I made more of that, but this is because I'm a bit of an etymology nerd..

I think the most important thing is that children, from 4 or 5, start making tracks towards bilingualism, irrelevant of the language chosen, and that sets you up incredibly well for learning languages later in life.

You might have heard about 'critical periods' when it comes to learning and language acquisition? (Apologies if you know this stuff, I'm approaching as if you don't!) But between 4-12 or so, the brain has a window were learning is especially effective compared to later life. Once you enter your teens, your brain starts this process of neuronal pruning which is where unused neuronal connections effectively die off because because they're not being used. In terms of intellect, this has no real impact, but in terms of auditory perception (my research field) it has quite the impact. You know how sometimes you might have someone from a foreign country teach you a word, and the sounds you produce are identical to theirs... yet they keep saying it's wrong? This is likely a result of pruning, the connections that would have allowed you to perceive those differences are no longer present. Neural plasticity is amazing  and it is likely possible to rebuild those connections, but it takes a lot longer.

Now if from a young age, the quantity of phonemes you learn during this critical period is a lot larger than just one language, then not only do you have twice the pool of vocabulary that might relate to this new language, but you have a greater range of phonemes that you can produce and perceive. I'm really lucky that I got to experience learning german, and later Dutch, in terms of my current welsh learning because phonemes like *Ll*, *Ng* (as in  ngastell Nedd) and *ch* are basically non-existent in English, French or Latin (I still struggle hugely with Ll).

I'm not saying what you said is wrong! This is just why I believe that no one language is better than the other to learn when at school!",null,0,null,1431774476,null,0,false,0,craxd5e,null,t3_3622i5,null,t1_craxd5e,null,t1_craw9nt,null,null,null,1433094610,null,4,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,4,null

This usually makes a tax increase to fund such services a much more easier pill to swallow.

Those 3m Apprenticeships sound great right? Up until you sign upto one, work for an employer at £2/h for the duration of the apprenticeship, only at the end for the company to end your employment.

It's just cheap labour. No real job opportunities.

For those of us who don't want to be on JSA and earn some money there just aren't many options. I've been out of further education for a year now, something I was reluctant to do given the current job climate. I couldn't afford to go to uni, I'm not well off enough to afford it and not hard done by enough to get support from the government. I currently work part-time in a kitchen earning minimum wage, on a good month I might scrape £400. I need to move onto full time work and start building a career but the jobs just aren't there, or employers are hesitant to take on new people. And the majority of young people out there aren't even lucky enough to be in my position. So I'm stuck.

And the good ol' experience paradox. To get a job they'll ask for a minimum of 2-3 years experience, problem is since I'm a newcomer to the job world, I don't have that experience, so I'm turned down. This is then a vicious cycle, I can't get a job without experience, but no chance of getting experience without a job.

ANPR records a particular numberplate's movements; if they looked at ANPR and saw your vehicle in London and then thirty minutes later it hit a camera in Blackpool, then that would be a substantive lead for locating this vehicle - one of those two is displaying a false numberplate.

Checking PNC would have been a serious longshot, but it would reveal if a vehicle displaying your numberplate was involved in some sort of interaction with the police - for example, if it was stopped and the occupants arrested; if it was seized and recovered for whatever reason (no insurance, parked dangerously, causing an obstruction, etc); if it was involved in a pursuit, etc.  So it could potentially have generated another lead, although the chances were slim.",null,0,null,1431775689,null,0,1431777792,0,craxmz2,null,t3_35zj7w,null,t1_craxmz2,null,t1_cravfn2,null,null,null,1433094737,null,1,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,1,null

&gt;__Go__ ([simplified Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters): 围棋; [traditional Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters): 圍棋; [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin): *wéiqí*, [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language): 囲碁 *igo*,  literal meaning: ""encircling game"", [Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language): 바둑 *baduk* ) is a [board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_game) involving two players that originated in [ancient China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Imperial_China) more than 2,500 years ago. It was considered one of the [four essential arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_arts) of a cultured Chinese scholar in antiquity. Its earliest written reference dates back to the [Confucian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius) [Analects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analects) [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*].

&gt;There is significant [strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_game) involved in the game, and the number of possible games is vast (10^761 compared, for example, to the 10^120 possible in [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess)),  despite its relatively simple rules.

&gt;The two players alternately place black and white [playing pieces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_piece_(board_game\)), called ""[stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game\)#stones)"", on the vacant intersections (""points"") of a [board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game\)#boards) with a 19x19 [grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_graph) of lines. Beginners often play on smaller 9×9 and 13×13 boards,  and [archaeological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological) evidence shows that game was played in earlier centuries on a board with a 17×17 grid. By the time the game had spread to [Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea) and [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan) in about the 5th and 7th [centuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centuries) [CE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era) respectively, however, boards with a 19×19 grid had become standard. 

&gt;The objective of the game—as the translation of its name implies—is to have surrounded a larger total area of the board with one's stones than the opponent by the end of the game,  although this result typically involves many more intricacies than simply using surrounding areas directly.

&gt;Once placed on the board, stones may not be moved, but stones may be removed from the board if captured—this is done by surrounding an opposing stone or group of stones by occupying all [orthogonally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality)-adjacent points.  The two players place stones alternately until they reach a point at which neither player wishes to make another move; the game has no set ending conditions beyond this. When a game concludes, the territory is counted along with captured stones and [komi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komidashi) (points added to the score of the player with the white stones as compensation for playing second) to determine the winner.  Games may also be won by resignation.

&gt;As of mid-2008, there were well over 40 million Go players worldwide, the overwhelming majority of them living in [East Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia).  As of May 2012 [update], the [International Go Federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Go_Federation) has a total of 74 member countries and four Association Members covering multiple countries.

null,false,Spiracle,null,null,null,"This is why arguing for electoral reform because it's 'fair' is pointless.  No electoral system is entirely fair, they all have their quirks and outliers.

The most dangerous thing about FPTP, as this article demonstrates, is not because it's 'unfair', it's because the shape of the government is determined more or less by chance.  It's random.  The tiny inputs and decisions of a couple of thousand people, little local events like whether a good canvasser was ill for week before the election, problems with printing leaflets, that sort of thing, are amplified into a majority that fixes the political, social and international outcomes for five years.  

What happened last week compared with 2010?  The Conservatives increased their vote share from 36.1% to 36.9% and the percentage gap between them and Labour actually decreased from 7.1% to 6.5%. Despite that the balls coming out of the FPTP lottery machine this time round dictated that we suddenly have majority government even though, as the opinion polls were saying, virtually nothing has changed. Re-draw the constituency boundaries only very slightly and the same people with the same opinions voting the same way would result in a different government.  Tiny variations in the weather on polling day also have a similarly disproportionate effect on the outcome.

There's a reason that nobody predicted the outcome of the election before the exit poll:  it's because it was literally unpredictable.  There's a branch of mathematics that deals with where tiny input variations make a system lurch between wildly variable stable outcomes: it's called 'Chaos Theory'.

OK, NATO at any rate.

We call it an RFI. (request for information).

We actually do it more than they do. (and the US does it a lot more whilst being a good bit more dickish about it).

Different tricks and reasons though. 

We send a lot more flight's out cos Russias hardware is mobile and they change all the time. 

We're after positions and signatures, they send their flights out to measure air response times, signatures and just generally say hello..

(there's bluff and counter bluff all over the shop ~ we don't send up escorts as soon as we see them any more than they light up acquisition radar's as soon as they see us)

It's a charade mostly cos if shit got hostile we know full well the russians wouldn't need big fat target's like a TU and we wouldn't respond with typhoons..

There is two leagues which each have two divisions in them. League 1 has the Barclays sponsorship and the two seem to follow a standard league promotion relegation set up.

What I can't find out is what teams get put in each division or even why they are put there. This doesn't get us promotion it just means that we are the best team in our division.

I like to pretend I'm the 22 year old crank that isn't as arsed about football anymore, but this is a worse feeling than the end of last season. Nearly. This lad has been at Liverpool since he was 8, the bloke everyone in school wanted to be growing up. I remember walking into the barbers with mates and asking for a 'Steven Gerrard haircut'. Asking the arl bird if I could have the new pair of predators every christmas so I'd look like Stevie every saturday playing on the pitches down the road from the Bluebell in Longy. I remember getting invited to the academy at Kirkby, and he was one of the first to meet everyone. He also turned up to a team day with a bag full of Yorkie chocolate bars. We weren't supposed to win anything in 2005 and he popped up with that goal, my favourite ever goal. The amount of times we spent on the back field trying to recreate that was incredible, and I think testament to how many lives he inadvertently touched. When things were shite as an angsty teenager in the rump of Merseyside, at least you had Saturday's and Stevie. I've had so many good days travelling with the Reds, and 95% of them were down to that man. 

Not entirely sure what those incoherent ramblings are supposed to indicate, but I guess I'm trying to say he's more than the footballer. To everyone that grew up wanting to be him, a more perfect example could not have been set. Thanks for the memories you created, and allowed everyone else to create Stevie. All the best lad.

I understand and can even see there seems to be some correlation between govt spending and GDP growth (as shown by this image from the nyt blog you linked http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/01/06/opinion/010615krugman2/010615krugman2-tmagArticle.png)


But I don't understand WHY this would be the case. For govt spending, for public goods like infrastructure (laying out fiber optics schooling etc), the return on those investments won't be seen for at least a couple of years. So clearly that's not the growth we're referring to when we talk about these graphs, which to me is the number 1 argument against cutting back programs in the name of austerity since they have a good ROI.


The implication of the fact that govt spending IMMEDIATELY garners results ( within a year or two) to me seems to imply that no matter what the money is spent on will lead to favourable results simply because money is being ""pumped into the economy."" 


I find this troubling because to me it makes no sense. That would mean the govt can pay people to dance in the woods and that would improve GDP. Maybe that's true, but if it is then WHY is it true, and how would that be any different than handing out tax breaks to say the lower 50%?

You might be able to catch a friendly at WHL during pre-season (since it'd be good to go there as a fan) and could go to the club shop then, but unfortunately the ground is in a pretty shit area which is quite hard to get to so unless you *really* want to I'd say going to the ground just for a shirt is probably not worth the trip.

If you go to Oxford Street or Tottenham Court Road you'll find sports shops like Sports Direct or JD Sports which will almost certainly sell Spurs shirts (and Oxford Street is famous for it's shopping).

Other than that you can do all the standard tourist stuff (I've put the nearest train station in brackets): London Eye off the South Bank (Waterloo), London Zoo in Regent's Park  (Regent's Park), Tower of London (Tower Hill), Buckingham Palace (Victoria or St James' Park) and St Paul's Cathedral (St Paul's or London Blackfriars) are all cool. Also if you're into history at all you should check out London's museums; British Museum (Holborn) and Natural History (South Kensington) are my favourites. We stole a bunch of awesome stuff from the colonies which you probably wont get a chance to see in America, so it's worth doing.

If you want to go off the beaten track and see some stuff tourists probably don't know about:

* [The Eagle Pub](http://www.theeaglefarringdon.co.uk/) near Hatton Garden (famous for selling diamonds) is one of the best places to eat in London for my money. Doesn't take bookings and gets rammed, so try not to go at peak hours but it's not ridiculously expensive and is great.
* [Brixton Village and Market](http://brixtonmarket.net/brixton-village/) are also great for grabbing something to eat. A lot of the places there are BYOB as well and you get live bands too.
* [Camden Market](http://www.camdenmarket.com/) is a cool place to just wander round and if you stay into the evening there are some nice places to grab a drink there, with Koko (nightclub) just round the corner too.
* [Bar Italia](http://www.baritaliasoho.co.uk/) in Soho is great for coffee and people watching. It's more or less in the West End, so you can walk there from Trafalgar Square.

That's probably way too much for a short visit; I grew up here and I've still only just started to feel like I know the place! Just wander round though; it's a great way to learn the streets and as long as you don't go too far from the centre you wont end up in any unsavoury areas (depending on where you're staying).",null,0,null,1431779295,null,0,false,0,crayjw2,null,t3_363imz,null,t1_crayjw2,null,t1_craxsb0,null,null,null,1433095167,null,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3,null

The trouble is, news is not a recitation of facts. It necessarily includes interpretation.

It's unrealistic to expect any news outlet to be purely objective. To me, saying the bbc (or any other news outlet) is unbiased is tantamount to saying that you personally like it. 

But then with every other news outlet, you exercise a choice and don't consume it, and therefore do not pay for it directly or indirectly.

For me the problem isn't whether I like or don't like the content of the bbc, it's that the choice is (all but) taken away from me.

China has nothing to gain - their economic sucess depends upon deeper integration into global markets, why would they throw decades of progress away by nuking a trading partner that poses no threat to their territorial integrity? Pakistan and India do not possess the technical capacity or the motives to target the UK.

The most likely scenario is the use of a nuclear weapon by a non-state actor, which still renders our nuclear weapons pointless - we can't nuke a sovereign state just because a handful of terrorists are hiding out there. 

Our nuclear weapons exist to defend us against a problem that doesn't exist and is extremely unlikely to exist.

He then went on to say that the keeper of my local team was arrogant because he threw the ball really far after saving a penalty. WTF?!

Hell, he's probably stalking my reddit right now so I should just say you're a top bloke, but seriously, he just threw the fucking ball that far because there was a player free on halfway and the entire opposition team bar a defender or two was around the penalty box. Doing a short throw would have been suicidal. Fucksake.

What's tough is going to the UK as a US fan and trying to justify how you ""chose"" a team, especially when that team happens to be good. That's when it becomes necessary to tell people yo've been a fan since before the takeover. I feel bad about it, because it isn't actually true in my case — I started following in 2008-09, the year of the takeover, but I was 12 so I wasn't even aware of this — but it really is necessary if you expect people to respect you as a fan.

No, I don't believe that is necessary. I believe that the convictions the Labour party should hold itself to should be positive ones, not negative ones. So for example, do we want to fight for (positive) the have-nots? Yes, of course. Do we want to stick it to (negative) big business? Personally, I think not necessarily. Yes, if they are dodging tax, exploiting workers, the environment etc, or whatever, but not just because they are a big business.

I don't think we have to have any double-standards, because I don't think they would contradict. 

&gt;By 'PC' I assume you mean 'Politically Correct'

No, Plaid Cymru. The Party of Wales.

&gt;What lost Labour seats in England was indulging the Tory economic line that 'Labour's profligate spending is the root cause of all our troubles' rather than confronting it and showing it to be the farce of an argument is actually is!

I agree that is probably the biggest error in the campaign.

&gt;How can it be irrelevant if the Tories are committed to making greater cuts in this Parliament than they did in the last Parliament?

Because by whatever horrific means possible, they will slash spending to whatever woeful level required to cancel the deficit by 2020. The next election will not be fought on austerity.

&gt;Neither do they enjoy choosing between 'austerity' and 'austerity-lite'.

I think you might have misunderstood me. I don't agree with austerity or 'austerity-lite'. I think we could have stimulated the economy out of recession much quicker than the Coalition's austerity measures did. I don't believe the deficit has to be reduced by spending cuts, I think it can be reduced by growing the economy. My point was that I don't think the Labour heartland are so ideologically fixed that any perceived move to a more inclusive set of policies would result in them voting for someone else.

null,false,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"&gt;But I don't understand WHY this would be the case. For govt spending, for public goods like infrastructure (laying out fiber optics schooling etc), the return on those investments won't be seen for at least a couple of years. So clearly that's not the growth we're referring to when we talk about these graphs, which to me is the number 1 argument against cutting back programs in the name of austerity since they have a good ROI.

&gt;The implication of the fact that govt spending IMMEDIATELY garners results ( within a year or two) to me seems to imply that no matter what the money is spent on will lead to favourable results simply because money is being ""pumped into the economy."" 

You've pretty much hit the nail on the head. Dumping debt monies into the economy grows GDP. GDP doesn't take into account the total size of debt, only the immediate cost of obligations. I can take out a trillion pounds of debt, spend it all today and get a trillion of GDP growth minus the cost of financing that debt. However the cost of financing that debt is now going to weigh down future growth. Debt is borrowing tomorrow's output and using that money today - hopefully to produce a greater output than the cost of borrowing (else why would you bother?). The net result is that you can grow your economy more quickly than without borrowing at all. Imagine if you had to save up every penny to buy a house instead of being able to get a mortgage.

&gt;I find this troubling because to me it makes no sense. That would mean the govt can pay people to dance in the woods and that would improve GDP. 

Referring to my previous paragraph, the money has to be used productively. Otherwise you're just taking on debt with no return - see Greece's situation with high wages, generous pensions and extremely lax tax collection. You end up with large obligations and no way to repay that money. People will be more reluctant to lend to you and the cost of borrowing will spiral, compounding your problem.

&gt;Maybe that's true, but if it is then WHY is it true, and how would that be any different than handing out tax breaks to say the lower 50%?

[Marginal Propensity to Consume](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_propensity_to_consume) is a very basic answer but with economics there are always other factors. People are going to consume food, water and shelter regardless of all other factors, ergo, giving people enough to live creates a stable foundation of consumption on which to grow an economy. This is why America's economy soared under Clinton. He got money into the hands of the poor majority and the economy boomed. It wasn't until the market shifted gears to a debt-driven consumer economy that we started having problems.

&gt; POOR Nick Clegg. The former leader of the Liberal Democrats is a decent, courageous man. He went into coalition with the Conservatives in 2010 with the noble intention of stabilising Britain’s economy. Yet on May 7th his party was pulverised at the polls. Though he kept his own seat, 49 out of 57 Lib Dem MPs lost theirs. They were overpowered even in traditional heartlands like Scotland and the south-west, by the Scottish National Party (SNP) and their own erstwhile Conservative allies. Three Lib Dem cabinet ministers lost their seats, and Mr Clegg immediately resigned as leader. “They are back to where they were in 1970,” says John Curtice, a political scientist at Strathclyde University.

&gt; What went wrong? Lib Dems could point to five years of restraining the Conservatives on a range of issues—from helping to sink a “snoopers’ charter” to preventing the scrapping of the Human Rights Act (both of which might now be pushed through by the Tories). Yet, for some core Lib Dem voters, the mere act of joining the Tories in coalition was treachery. Others were alienated by the compromises that followed. Mr Clegg paid dearly for breaking his promise not to raise university tuition fees. All proof, says Mr Curtice, that “you cannot win an election if people do not trust you”. (The same was true last week for Labour, he suspects.)

&gt; For floating voters, the party failed to enunciate a clear message. And by entering government with the Tories in 2010 it had already lost its place as a protest party—a position now occupied by UKIP, the SNP and the Greens. The Tories had lost voters at by-elections but many of them returned last week, spooked by the possibility of a Labour government backed by the SNP. Few Lib Dem deserters came back.    Now the party is picking up the pieces and trying to rediscover what it stands for. Some have suggested it go back to its roots as the party of Gladstone and Lloyd George and change its name back to the Liberal Party. Others, such as David Steel, a grandee, say the party needs to regain its left-of-centre edge. The best person to do that as leader would be Tim Farron, who retained his seat in the Lake District and did not vote for the tuition-fees rise. The other main contender is Norman Lamb, an older, Cleggish type. Optimists point out that thousands of people have joined the party since its electoral wipeout. But the Lib Dems were knocked out of contention in many Parliamentary constituencies (see article). They also lost many of their local councillors, who make good footsoldiers.

&gt; Another explanation for the Lib Dems’ terrible performance is that they are no longer necessary. In a tearful farewell speech, Mr Clegg lamented the demise of liberalism and the “fear and grievance” evident in the rise of Scottish and English nationalisms. He vowed that he would not allow “decent liberal values” to die.

&gt; But they have not. The Tories ate up Lib Dem votes partly because they have swallowed much of the party’s ideology. The Conservative embrace of causes like gay marriage means liberals do not have to vote Liberal Democrat these days. Indeed, although the Tories still have plenty of illiberal edges, David Cameron, the prime minister, has called himself a liberal conservative. Tony Blair had absorbed much liberalism into the Labour Party. Even the SNP, though illiberal in its nationalism, is pro-gay marriage and pro-immigration.

&gt; It is true that a significant minority is anti-liberal. UKIP secured 12% of the vote (though only one seat) by kicking back against the globalised, multi-ethnic society that Britain has become. Yet overall, Mr Clegg lost not because liberalism is under threat but because it has become mainstream. Indeed, the metropolitan assumption that liberalism conquers everything is part of what UKIP so dislikes. That will be small consolation for Mr Clegg as he watches the triumphant Mr Cameron trying to balance those competing forces. But it is hopeful for Britain.",null,0,null,1431782353,null,0,false,0,crazi8l,null,t3_365v69,null,t1_crazi8l,null,t3_365v69,null,null,null,1433095618,null,3,false,LibDem,t5_2qwov,3,null

There are some very odd and interesting trends in the tech industry, software is evolving all the time - particularly enterprise software.

In the particular area I work right now there huge demand for skill and there is literally no UK based people with the skillset required (we will hire from anywhere in the UK - we operate globally).

Instead we are having to pay expensive hotel and cost expenses to bring in out of country senior resources with the technical skills to fulfil immediate and urgent projects - yet we can't get long term visas for them to stay!

Ironically we do take on juniors to train - but it will take years for that junior to acquire the senior skill-set.

After a very tense first game, I succumbed and sent the tower crashing down. Facing up to my forfeit, I headed to the drinks cabinet. All of a sudden, a chorus of ""DOUBLE OR QUITS"" rang from my friends. 

I looked at the victor, and he looked at me. We exchanged a knowing nod and agreed. 

Clearly, the stakes were far higher this time round. People gathered round and gave their undivided attention. My girlfriend was looking terrified, as she had to sleep next to me that night (she didn't know I could handle it at the time). 

We decided to walk to the 'arena' this time to our own theme song. I went with the timeless Def Leppard track 'Pour Some Sugar On Me', whilst my opponent went with... Actually I've forgotten. Never mind. 

So the Hartbeat theme song was stuck on, and we began. The crowd, realising the stakes, had shut up during our turns, only to let out an ""OOOHHH"", or a ""WOOAAHH"" as we pulled the wooden blocks from their places. After I made my turns, I looked over to my worried girlfriend, who was clearly relieved that I had completed my turn. Neither of us could really set each other up, and the crucial side pieces were taking too much weight to remove. 

After about 20 turns however, I had him. I knew his weaknesses, namely that he only had one usable hand, but also that he was a bit pissed already. I knew he'd lose now, he knew he'd lose now, but he went ahead, taking his defeat with valour and courage. He took the fatal turn and not only the tower collapsed, but also his plans of leaving relatively early and not being hungover at work the next day. I was happy, my girlfriend was happier, and the crowd were grateful that it was over. 

In the end, he went for a mixture of shots. Three gin, two whisky, and one homemade sloe gin. He stepped up to the kitchen counter, took his shirt off, and eyed up the shot glasses. 

""I NEED A FUCKING THEME SONG FOR THIS!"" He shouted. 

""GIVE ME TAYLOR FUCKING SWIFT!"" 

We hastily got the song up on YouTube, and he began. He decided on the three gin shots first, followed by the two whisky, and the sloe gin. He did not look happy, but in his defence, he did them all. Without purging, either. Still proud of him to this day. 

Anyway, that's what that song reminds me of. Brings a smile to my face to this day. ",null,0,null,1431785527,null,0,false,0,crb0on5,null,t3_364qfq,null,t1_crb0on5,null,t1_craykzh,null,null,null,1433096243,null,3,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,3,null

How can it be our responsibility as a wealthy western democracy to have nuclear weapons when most wealthy western democracies don't have nuclear weapons? Why do we need them when Japan, Germany and every other EU country other than France gets by fine without them?

Why should we meet the NATO 2% of GDP on defense spending recommendation when most NATO countries don't bother? You are wrong to imply we have to meet it, there is no penalty to not meeting this target, we are going to go below it under Tory spending plans anyway.

Do you really think it's a serious argument that we have spend £100bn on weapons of mass destruction to protect thousands of jobs? There are countless of other ways that money could be spent that would both provide jobs and a useful public service, we could put it into the NHS, invest in renewables or home insulation or other infrastructure projects.

the UK nations, and the highest percentage of public sector employees working in local government. This is symptomatic to a local council system that has to cover a very low population density with regards to public services, and a large amount of people in public employment for land regulation, forestry and agricultural commission. Public employment also covers the NHS and state schools (IE, most schools).

Furthermore, the rural, welsh speaking 'economic backwaters' of which you speak are precisely the ones with less than average public employment. Powys, Gwynedd, Conwy are such places, and the ones with above average public sector employment are the urban centres in the south: Cardiff, Bridgend, Swansea. [It'd be nice if people looked up statistics.](http://www.assembly.wales/Research%20Documents/Public%20Sector%20Employment%20-%20Research%20paper-07052013-245987/rn13-008-English.pdf)
You can just as much find a company in wales that needs welsh speakers as you can ones that need 'foreign' language speakers. On the world's stage, it's not much, but you need a much more competent level of teaching and education than to a GCSE level french or other language for it to contribute to your employment capabilities- such as a degree level or A level skill.",null,0,null,1431785885,null,0,false,0,crb0ttl,null,t3_3622i5,null,t1_crb0ttl,null,t1_craz223,null,null,null,1433096310,null,2,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,2,null

null,false,strolls,null,null,null,"Savile is a poor example of your claim.

He was investigated by 3 or 4 different police forces at various periods of his life - but the charges didn't stick because of sufficient evidence, and because none of the investigating officers knew about the previous enquiries, because they predated the police national computer.

Savile was very adept at befriending and manipulating idiots with authority, and at avoiding those who suspected him. He only operated in places where the boss thought he was this amicable rich eccentric, and the nurses who recognised his creepiness reported that he'd leave the ward as soon as they arrived on shift.

You really should read some of the reports on Savile - I think [this PDF one](http://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/research-reports/yewtree-report-giving-victims-voice-jimmy-savile.pdf) would be a good place to start.

The way Savile got away with it is scary precisely because he appears not to have needed anyone to cover up for him.

No-one who's saying now ""I knew what he was like"" or ""it was an open secret"" ever made a formal complaint about Savile's behaviour or activities. I don't mean to blame them for that, because he was a slippery cunt, but it's way more complicated and nuanced than you imply.

Savile groped women in public - he groped a girl on live TV, whilst facing the camera and telling the nation about next week's show, and he put his hands up another woman's skirt whilst sitting next to her on the train. I daresay she was too shocked to make a fuss - such reactions are quite common.

From all the accounts I've read, Savile was the sort of bloke who would look you in the eye when he was committing sexual assault, carry on talking to you, and leave you thinking ""he's not, is he? he can't be!""",null,0,null,1431786175,null,0,1431789384,0,crb0y6f,null,t3_362mqw,null,t1_crb0y6f,null,t1_cramdyy,null,null,null,1433096367,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,LordHighBrewer,cnty-uk,Canadian/British,null,"I would argue that current events in the last few years have overtaken this viewpoint. Specifically in the case of Russia, Iran, China and North Korea. Russia's invasion of the Ukraine has raised the spectre of state-on-state warfare in Europe, and as their stockpile of 5,000 nuclear weapons increasingly modernises in line with the rest of their armed forces, the nations of eastern Europe are increasingly uneasy and isolated. Iran's nuclear program is still being negotiated, and they will probably gain a significant nuclear power program and lessened sanctions in exchange for cancellation of their nuclear weapons program. This will reduce the lead time necessary to produce a nuclear weapon further, and will probably lead to demands of other middle eastern countries for similar programs. 

This is a particularly dangerous situation, as these nations may also make a similar quick leap from power to weapons, potentially leading to a nuclear armed race, and in combination with their unstable, dictatorial nature and the rise of ISIL, we may well face an aggressive, expansionist, nuclear-armed Islamic dictatorships in the middle east. 

China's aggressive action in the South China sea is underscored by the knowledge that their possession of nuclear weapons renders outright confrontation unlikely, even as the US pivots towards the pacific. They will no doubt continue their island grabbing campaign, safe in the knowledge that with nuclear weapons trained on Taiwan and Japan, the US will find it difficult to launch military action against them, but Britain's concerns lie with India, against whom they share a border and a history of conflict. With active and high-level defence relations between our two countres, and some 50% of Britain's trade due to be moving through the india ocean by 2030, we have significant interest in supporting India over china, while seeking the diffusion of a possible Mexican stand-off between indian, Pakistan and China.

Finally, North Korea's nuclear weapon program continues apace, with the recent launching of medium ranged ballistic missiles, and the possible more recent launching of submarine based systems. Future developments are likely to be based upon the creation of a true SSBN/ICBM program, capable of targeting the US and her Allies, and as Britain attained a high profile in the Korean war, with our stand at Gloster hill and the Imjin, coupled with our support of the US, we would also be a likely target.

We must therefore reassess our strategic and defence capabilities realistically in the light of these developments. Your outlining of deterrence as depending upon a threat is only partially correct, as you neglect to mention that deterrence rests upon force, and the threat of force. Accordingly our enemies, but for the moment Russia, will judge the UK and NATO on this basis. Their previous invasion of Georgia and the Ukraine, coupled with their recent flights against the edge of UK airspace and the threatening of Nuclear attack against Denmark mark Russia as a state willing to utilise military force and nuclear blackmail in the pursuit of their geo-political objectives. This threat must be placed against our own situation. The extensive curtailing of our armed forces, Infighting in the EU on both internal and external policy and the poor way that NATO nations have committed to re-armament following the Wales Summit makes further aggressive action by Russia more, not less likely. At the moment, an article five violation against the Baltic states would most likely be greeted with submission-and a great fait accompli for Russia, with us accepting the loss of these nations right to national self-determination in favour of saying much but doing little, our inability to react underscored by Russian conventional and nuclear stength. This will shake NATO to its core, and provoke further attack.

These conclusions will also likely be arrived at by powers in the middle east and North Korea. We are in short faced by a number of unstable, expansionist, repressive nuclear armed or nuclear-developing states. Further disarmenent, especially of our nuclear weapons, on the basis that we face no creditable or suitable threats, is a naïve, uninformed point of view that is almost five years out of date, and would leave us in hock to a number of aggressive nuclear armed states who bear historical grievances against us and do not have our wider or more limited interests at heart.

The best means of combating this will depend upon action across a spectrum of capabilities-political, economic and yes, military, to provide the hard muscle crucial behind diplomatic soft power. What is critical is the rearmament of the UK, and that will include a creditable nuclear weapons program, for the medium to long term. In the Short term the renewal of trident should be coupled with military and political support to the Baltic states to deter further attack, for the medium term a carrot and stick approach in the middle east to deter a nuclear arm race, as well as long terms planning surrounding the India, China and Pakistan and our relations with these countries.

&gt;

&gt;__The Shambles__ (official name __Shambles__) is an old street in [York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York), [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England), with overhanging [timber-framed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timber_framing) buildings, some dating back as far as the fourteenth century. It was once known as __The Great Flesh Shambles__, probably from the [Anglo-Saxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_language) *Fleshammels* (literally 'flesh-shelves'), the word for the shelves that butchers used to display their meat. As recently as 1872 there were twenty-five butchers' shops in the street but now there are none.

&gt;Among the buildings of the Shambles is a shrine to [Saint Margaret Clitherow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Margaret_Clitherow), who was married to a butcher who owned and lived in a shop there at No. 10 Shambles, her home is now a cufflinks shop, Cuffs &amp; Co, and features the priest hole fireplace that ultimately led to her death.

&gt;Although the butchers have now vanished, a number of the shops on the street still have meat-hooks hanging outside and, below them, shelves on which meat would have been displayed. The shops currently include a mixture of eateries and souvenir sellers, but there is also a bookshop and a bakery.

It will almost never produce a majority government. Now sometimes coalitions can be stable (like in the last parliament) but in other countries with PR, like Israel, it takes a very long time after each election to produce a government, which is not ideal.

Also, in a PR system, small parties have a disproportionate amount of power; they are the king makers in any potential coalition situation. So whilst UKIP and the Greens are underrepresented at the moment, with PR they would have far more control over the country than their voting percentage would suggest. This causes the politics of the major parties to shift in order to appeal to the small, extreme parties, causing an overall shift away from the centre, which is again the situation in Israel now.

Germany and Japan don't have them for obvious historic reasons. But Germany is a member of NATO, and I can for see the lack of weapons from Japan to be an issue if the future as it comes into conflict with China. The lack of a deterrent there makes an armed conflict more likely.

2. Because it is our responsibility. I know there's no punishment and other countries have reneged on their commitment but that doesn't mean we should.

3. No, I wouldn't maintain trident on the basis of the economic argument alone. This was just to counter the point the money spent is regarded as going down the toilet. Its not, a good portion of it is going to British workers and then back into the economy. It's maintaining a British industry that I consider vital to maintain Britain's future.

Think about it, if we had PR, how would the government get anything done? More people would vote Green and UKIP, since tactical voting does nothing any more, so parliament would be a lot more evenly spread. Three or four parties would need to agree on something to even gain a majority in a vote, since no single party has the mandate to *do* anything.

I'm very wary of invoking Godwin's Law, but given I've studied it Weimar Germany is the most obvious example for me to draw from. After WWI Germany wanted to appease the allies by making the most democratic system possible to replace the Kaiser. The PR system lead to weak governments in Germany for *decades*, and was a contributing factor to the rise of the Nazi Party, since Hitler could scapegoat the country's numerous problems on ineffective politicians.

The counter argument is that PR is fair. Which it is; and FPTP is most certainly not fair.

Seriously does absolutely nobody even understand the original purpose of the HoL? It is flabbergasting.    

The HoL exists to ""sanity check"" the laws a government passes. That's why they're full of experts: In business, law, education, religion, and government. They're actually extremely effective in that role, not because they bounce a lot of laws (they don't) but because they will send it back down to the lower house for fixes.    

This type of criticism all started when there was a move to get rid of hereditary peers. People just started claiming that the HoL was an outdated useless organisation (likely because the HoL isn't in the media, it isn't exciting or interesting, it is slow and steady). They were right to get rid of hereditary peers as they don't even serve the upper house's purpose particularly well.    

What you're proposing: PR HoL entirely misses why the HoL even exists. The Lords exist to be experts in a lot of areas and to bring that expertise to the floor when it comes to laws and to rebound a crazy government in the commons. If the Lords was PR and FPTP in the commons, you could end up with e.g. Tories in both and there would be no constraining them, no limit on their power.    

If anything the Lords needs less ex politicians and more experts. The HoLs should be technocrats.

You have to understand what has happened in Scotland as to why this reasoning not only isn't effective anymore, it is damaging to the party.

Labour have used such reasoning to get elected in Scotland for decades, it's been appeals to the past for a long time. The SNP have now come along and have made appeals, agree with them or not, to the future. 

When you compare the two it just makes Labour look pathetic, especially as New Labour policies were never very popular in Scotland. It's like they are asking us to ignore what happened in the last 20 years because they did something good 50 years ago. 

Why would anyone vote for them when there are others that are making a reasonably strong and positive argument for what can be done tomorrow?

Simply, Labour using its past as a reason to vote for them no longer has any effect on the Scottish electorate and it in fact damages the party to do so.",null,0,null,1431789706,null,0,false,0,crb2hzy,null,t3_365woh,null,t1_crb2hzy,null,t1_crb1j4w,null,null,null,1433097098,null,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13,null

You haven't seen much Bony, have you? His movement and link-up play are brilliant and he works much harder than Benteke.

Just because Bony's highlights tend to include a lot of headers and screamers, don't let that fool you - he had everything. Benteke is very good at a couple things but mediocre at many others, and his movement, intelligence and ability to bring players into the game - all things Bony excelled at at Swansea - aren't up to the standards we need.

1) The £20bn in interest was on the entire National Debt going back to 1692 but far more was accumulated from 1979-1997 than in:

a) The preceding 300 years

b) The following 11 years

2) In 1992 National Debt was 26.7% of GDP, in 1997 it was 41.8% of GDP and in 2008 it was 38.93%.

3) The current chancellor pledged to match Labour's spending plans at the time, not only did he not criticise them for over-spending, but he pledged to increase spending year on year.

http://conservativehome.blogs.com/torydiary/2007/09/tories-will-mat.html

&gt;""I can confirm for the first time that a Conservative Government will adopt [the Government's] spending totals. Total government spending will rise by 2 per cent a year in real terms, from £615 billion next year to £674 billion in the year 2010-11. Like Labour, we will review the final year’s total in a spending review in 2009.  The result of adopting these spending totals is that under a Conservative Government there will be real increases in spending on public services, year after year.""

He had a pretty shocking game a couple years ago when we were knocked out of the FA Cup by minnows Oldham, but I think he's a better player now, bit more mature even though he's only 24.

Probably on a level with Ilori, behind Sakho, Skrtel and Lovren. If I had my way, he or Ilori would be the 4th centre-half next season, the other being loaned out for a season or two until Skrtel leaves.

null,false,KyotoWolf,null,null,null,"I agree with the article somewhat. We've certainly seen the triumph of liberalism within the last century and the co-option of some liberal values by both main parties. It's not incorrect to place the fall of the old Liberal Party in the 1920s to the triumph of liberal policies - the victory of free trade before 1931, the victory of nonconformity, the victory of social liberalism - leaving the Liberals without firm ideological battlegrounds to square off on in opposition. With the defection of the Whigs, Liberal Unionists, and National Liberals to the Conservative Party and of the Hobsonite Liberals to the Labour Party both were infused with liberal values, and in a way you can say that the values of the Liberal Party lived on in mainstream politics despite the overshadowing of the party itself. With the recommendations of Beveridge being co-opted by Labour as well as the ideals espoused under the welfare and taxation reforms under Asquith's ministry, and of the work of Conservatives like Keith Joseph to re-ignite economic liberalism in what they'd eventually formulate into 'Thatcherism'. There are definite strands of liberalism throughout both main parties.

Despite the victory of social liberalism, and a limited form of economic liberalism (neoliberalism) however I disagree with the thrust of the argument in The Economist. While Labour and the Conservatives have co-opted many liberal values they both remain statist parties, and neither mainstream Labour or Conservatives put much stock in civil liberties (though you could argue Gladstonian Liberalism didn't either). 

The LibDems distinguish themselves on this point, they are often (but not always) united by liberty. No other mainstream party views liberty as instinctually vital to Britain as the LibDems do, but civil liberties are not enough to build an electorally successful party.

null,false,toomanyairmiles,,Labour Member,null,"In 1996, around four hours after registering at uni in Edinburgh, I found myself listening to Alex Salmond speak. All of the main parties had been invited to student hustings to encourage party registration but only Salmond turned up.

Already being a Labour member (grandson of trade unionists, I had a lifetime membership three months after conception) I was campaigning for the devolution referendum a year later. What I found was quite shocking. The branches barely met, had no policy ideas, and mainly operated as a poorly attended social club. 

On the doorstep allegations of 'red tory' were common and you would really struggle to disagree with them - the elite of Scotland were all Labour voters and had no interest dealing with the extraordinary poverty on the sink estates surrounding the major cities or the complexities of life in remote communities.

By 1999 Dewar had returned from Westminster to lead the Scottish Assembly. He was a popular figure, but many in the party struggled with the fact that he had left Scotland for career, like so many other young people, and was only now returning for a coronation. Just like Murphy, Cook, Brown, Darling, the list is endless.

Listening to a friend who had gone to Scotland for the independence campaign describe the state of the party in Scotland it was clear to me nothing had changed. The leadership could best be described as the 'z' team, many in the party supported independence, the branches remained social clubs, and the members were disengaged from a campaign that had nothing to offer *for* Scotland but 'their figures are wrong', 'don't do something you'll regret'.

Alex Salmond wanted the referendum date, Cameron wanted straight Yes or No, Labour wanted DevoMax. Salmond and Cameron did a deal and placed Labour in a trap, and we walked straight into it without a second thought. 

Neither Unionist party could present a positive vision for Scotland via a new Scotland Act so Darling waged an entirely negative campaign fighting for the status quo with vague promises of a new settlement after 2015. Communities were divided, friends and families stopped speaking to each other - a deep anger bubbled to the surface. Quite obviously the 'victory' was pyrrhic - literally bonfire of the vanities.

Parachuting in Murphy at the last minute with nothing new to offer was just more of the same garbage that Scottish voters had been hearing for the last half century and I'm not at all surprised it didn't work.

If Labour wants its voice heard in Scotland again it needs to be a voice *from* Scotland speaking to England fighting for Scottish issues and not the other way around. We need a strong Scottish Labour party that believes in the union and can say in a single sentence why the union is worthwhile. The exact same thing is true in Wales.

null,false,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,null,"&gt; Substational rises in min wage

£8 an hour isn't substantial at all when you factor in inflation, in fact it would still be below the living wage. The Tories have said they want to see the minimum wage increase to £8 an hour by 2020 too, which just highlights how similar the two parties are. The Greens wanted to see it rise to £10, that would have been a substantial raise.

&gt; Rental controls

Their ""rent controls"" would only have prevented landlords from putting up rents for the life of the tenancy, they were far less radical than they sounded. They cost the Labour a lot in terms of ""economic credibility"" while actually offering very little to renters, the story of their whole campaign really. The best way to control rents is to build more social housing (again as the Greens proposed).

Yeah it is a great shame we aren't getting that one actually, though arguably it's not a left or right thing to do just a reform to make our government more democratic.

Again it's a shame that didn't go ahead, but Labour introduced privatisation to the NHS and they didn't seem to have the appetite to reverse anything they had previously done themselves - only the Greens were offering to undo NHS privatisations.

&gt; Complete commitment to the EU

Is neither a left nor right issue, some on the left don't like the EU either, the Greens were critical of it's undemocratic nature and actually sided with UKIP on wanting a referendum (though I doubt we'll be campaigning to leave).

&gt; Increasing large corp tax

I thought it was the opposite, that they had ruled out corporation tax increases (not even to take the tax rate back to where they had left it in 2010).

&gt; Increasing high earner income tax

Another one that would have been good actually, I wonder if the Tories will cut it again now or leave it as it is.

&gt; Overhaul of hmrc

Is needed, but all parties including the Tories are pledging to crack down on tax avoidance now, not sure any of them can be trusted to deliver at this point.

&gt; Reestablishment of state education

You mean no new free schools? Yeah that would have made sense, again it's not moving the country in a left-wing direction just keeping it where it is.

&gt; I suspect what you're about to see with the labour party will be a return to the Tory-lite days.

I suspect so too, but it won't help them win back Green or SNP voters.",null,0,null,1431791362,null,0,false,0,crb3aym,null,t3_365ida,null,t1_crb3aym,null,t1_crazws4,null,null,null,1433097477,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Kane got just about marked out.  Eriksen continued his spell of being unimpressive. 

But I think we played decently in the second half. 

Strongest players, for me, were Hugo, Rose, Lamela, and Vertonghen.  Hugo was a beast, coming off his line quickly to pick everything up. Rose was his usual self, shut down plays down his side, and scored a beautiful fucking goal. Lamela was also a mixed bag, but I think he was one of the more creative players. Unforunately, his passes under pressure were unreliable. Vertonghen was also solid in the box, he covered for Rose well when Danny got forward and made a number of good headers and blocks. 

There were a couple plays in the second half that showed out CMs doing better. At one point, Rose went forward, immediately, Vertonghen shifted over and Bentaleb covered the CB spot. It was seamless. Then Mason tracked a runner back and we shut down their attack. It was a sign of things getting better. Hopefully we can do that more consistently.

You have to think whether you are more interested in a principled vote or a vote which makes a better outcome. It's all very well to say the system is broken but what can you do about it? Certainly a whole lot less now the Tories have a majority. 

There's little point trying to tell of conservative voters for voting that way, they voted one way and got what they wanted. Green voters in marginal seats on the other hand are really going to have to answer to the people who are far less well treated by policies made by a Tory majority government.

Honestly we played well throughout we were just a bit non existent in the middle at times. Thought Ross looked dangerous when he was on but my god where's his shooting ability gone? Can't even get it on target anymore. That's almost definitely out of contention for Europa through fair play I'd imagine so hopefully we can put this season behind us and finish in 5-6th next year again where we belong. 

I think I'm in the minority here but i think we should definitely keep McGeady unless we get a really good offer from Celtic or something. I've always said he's a confidence player and that if you give him faith hell play well. Everyone goes on about his consistency but Mirallas is the most inconsistent player in the squad but obviously Kev is a better overall player. Just hope McGeady can show his real brilliance with us if not however I wish him the best of luck. 

Galloway had a really good debut in my opinion. To be just thrown into a game with one of the more physical sides in the league isn't easy but he coped really well. I think he's a really good defender but doesn't seem that much of an attacking threat compared to Garbutt and Baines. Can't wait to see how he develops and if Martinez wants to convert him to a centre back then I'm sure he'll be on the same path as Stones with his playing from the back.

Of course then there's Rom. How in the name of God has he gotten 20 goals this year? We're not exactly the best club for a lone striker to work with but that just shows his true quality. I think he'll definitely not have a worse season than this and that's saying something. I'd say a realistic target next year would be 20-25 again but bearing in mind he has less games to do it in. He also has more goals in all competitions than Costa which is amazing. 

All in all today the young players really showed their potential in my opinion and if we can improve in the summer where we need, I'm not gonna say where because I think everyone on this sub knows my opinion on who needs replacing, I think we can become a real champions league threat once again and go back to where we belong.

We start the season, get all our hopes up, maybe we even make a few decent signings in the transfer window. And then the season begins. We win a few, we loose a few, but the reality is that for us a fantastic amazing best we can possibly hope for season is the UEFA cup...a cup that the last time we were part of it we got all the way to the semi-finals and then played the kids as the club give it zero value what so ever. A more realistic good season for us is mid-table nothingness. And right now, the most likely outcome is a bit of a relegation battle, but never being really in trouble... there is always someone just a tiny bit more shit than us.

It is absolutely boring and pointless. I am sick of it and I have been sick of it for many years. I do love the club, and when I go to Villa Park I get as passionate as anyone else, but the reality is that when I get home and think about it... whats the point? We have zero hope, its all very predictable and very pointless. I really am sick to death of Premier League football. We can and will never compete for  the league title, and even a top 4 spot is probably a once in every 50 years thing for a club like us.

I genuinely want to get relegated. I want to be playing the Blues, I want to be going away to new places were the results are more predictable. I do not believe that we will bounce right back, but that does not bother me... I want a change, I want relation. Yet another year of Premiership football to look forward to... and if you really think about it, what are we looking forward to? At best a few signings and mid table? As a club, our excitement comes from the odd cup run here and there, we could still have that in the Championship.

I want a change. I desperately want a change. I was so hopefull that this year would be the year, but nope, another year of Permiership football to look forward to. I realise I am in a massive minority thinking it, but really, I genuinely believe I would personally enjoy going to Villa Park and away days more in the Championship. Not to mention actually playing more games on a Saturday / Wednesday and god forbid my wallet would thank me.... hey ho, lets all celebrate staying up so we can do it all again for another pointless year.

There are productive workers' (designers, producers) and non-productive workers' (managers, lawyers, accountants, administrators, etc.) salaries, and there are also fixed and marginal costs of production, but, even after all of these are met, there is a surplus which the owners and their appointees decide how to distribute, and a large proportion of this will be distributed to entirely passive investors (shareholders) who bring nothing to the party except their capital.  So all your elements above (the idea, the understanding, the organisation, the management, the legal expertise and the accountancy) are already covered.  Under socialism, it is the workers who democratically determine how this surplus is allocated, and it is likely that they will do so differently.  

Another point - it's clear from a great deal of research which has been carried out over the decades (often by big capitalist corporations) that autogestion (self-management) is equally as productive as traditional forms of management, as well as saving many of the costs of external management and security for distribution to productive workers.

I remember Alan Hansen as captain when I first started watching Liverpool, I've seen a few captains come and go since then, and I've seen a few Liverpool greats leave the club (Hansen, Whelan, Rush, Barnes, Fowler, Hyppia and Carra to name a few), but Gerrard is something different. He's a few months older than me, and I've watched his entire career as he lived out the dreams I had as a kid that I could never have fulfilled. He was the best English player of his generation, and at his peak he was one of the best three or four players in the world. I'd certainly rate him as the most complete player in the history of the game. 

  It's time for him to go, but that doesn't mean it's not a sad day, even though it was inevitably going to happen at some point. He is genuinely a legend. Suarez is the best player I've seen for Liverpool, but he's not a legend in my eyes, just a happy memory. Gerrard *was* Liverpool. He dragged us kicking and screaming to trophies, and at times he carried the team to such an extent that he could have been the only player on the pitch. Never have I seen a player who scored such spectacular goals so consistently. There was a time when Gerrard receiving the ball anywhere within 40 yards of the opposing goal was viewed as a legitimate goal scoring chance. 

  The club will go on. We'll win more trophies, we'll keeping competing with the best. But we'll never see a player like him again. There was never a player like him before. That's what it means for me. As a club, we're losing a player who is getting old and needs to move on (although he's still had some great games over the last couple of years).

Do they work? Yes. Do they receive benefits? Yes. Would they receive benefits if they did not work? No. Ergo they receive benefits for working and their labour is not free. It is not contentious or partisan of me to outline the basic outline of the Government's policy. 

You're really misunderstanding my point. My framing is the intent and ultimate outcome of the policy. Your framing is point scoring - point scoring that does little to actually combat the relative merits of the policy. That's my original point, you're politiking for Question Time claps and cheap pops, you're not actually engaging with any substance. If you'd have engaged on why the Work Programme is flawed we wouldn't be having an issue, but instead you went to the echo-chamber, posting for upvotes and applause rather than making a substantial point. You decided to go with the echo-chamber rather than trying to persuade people of the merits of your cause.

We're pretty much arguing for the sake of arguing now though, on a pretty pointless 'issue'.

Off the top of my head: Counterfeit anime DVDs, Counterfeit Ball-Jointed Dolls, Counterfeit anime merchandise, including plushes, figurines &amp; statues. And pretty much anything else you can get for a few pence from ebay and sell for legitimate prices.

Plus there are countless rumours of rigged YuGiOh and Pokemon tournaments, that see his group of friends consistently come top of.

Not to mention he destroyed Dama-con, which was at that point NI's only real anime-focused con. The then head of Dama set up a NI-Only manga publication company, Zenpop. Which instead of jumping onboard of, he boycotted.
Then when Dama all but went tits-up, he then hosted his own wee convention thing called Re:Con (apparently in business with Tokyopop), selling only his stocks of anime, manga and merchandise. Declaring it the only one of it's type in NI!

Fun story: One of the few years of Re:Con, he somehow managed to get a rep from Nintendo to show up and run a wee competition for some random Nintendo junk. He had the stupidity to hook up a pirated version of Smash Bros Brawl (which wasn't released here yet) to the projector! Needless to say there hasn't been a Nintendo rep since.

Also, now this is admittedly second-hand info; but back in the day when he ran a Warhammer club, there were rumours of theft. Apparently there was 'fund' that everyone paid into to then collectively buy new terrain tables and stuff, which was mysteriously and significantly smaller than what it should have been. Someone cried shenanigans, nothing could be proven, so everyone just went their separate ways.
 
And relating it all back to my original point, I wouldn't simply because he marks up prices on banged-up old games and consoles.

In the US you are practically required to have a degree to do any tech job but in the UK it's only seen as a slight bonus. You need experience far more than a degree in the UK.

If you're a new CS graduate, the best (and possibly only) route is to start as either a junior software developer or as IT helpdesk then work your way up.

You're not going to get into a £60k+ job straight from uni.

Typical routes would be:

- Junior Software (web) Developer -&gt; Software Developer -&gt; Lead Developer/other team lead -&gt; Software Architect etc
- IT helpdesk -&gt; Junior SysAdmin -&gt; general SysAdmin -&gt; (Linux|Windows|Virt|other speciality) Sysadmin/DB Admin -&gt; Senior SysAdmin -&gt; Senior Systems Engineer

Shockingly naive understanding of how politics in England works, it isn't just all or nothing, you need to have a mandate to act as well as the right policies. It's all very well saying no austerity and then standing at the periphery, but you'll never ever get anything positive done.

There was a 50billion difference between the budgets of the two major parties. That sum can make an unbelievable difference to so many people's lives and yet you're unwilling to enable that change because ""they're all the same"".

Thats why the people abstaining on full marriage equality are for civil unions, allowing gay people the right to couple and form unions that are equivalent to marriage, to adopt and raise kids, to donate blood, be free from 'conscience clause' backed discrimination, and live harassment free lives.

Some people have the view that marriage is for the purpose of birthing children. Something that gay people can't by definition do. And people can have this view for non-bigoted reasons. Some have this view for bigoted reasons too, no doubt about it, but at the end of the day you can't force people or religions to think a certian way.

The way the 'abstainers' are getting attacked you'd think they'd come out with an Iris Robinson quote or something. It's quite appalling.

The party position, now voted in, is that full marriage should be available as an option to same sex couples. They can get it done at the registry office or at any church that recognises same sex unions as a marriage. If a church doesn't recognise same sex unions as marriage, they will not be forced to perform those ceremonies. Hopefully this will be enough to bring the 'abstainers' on board, as well as make SSM provision less threatening to our more conservitive citizens.

Even that, I suspect, will not be enough for the faux-liberals and the SJWs. The irony is that Alliance get attacked by the DUP et al for aparently wanting everyone to think the same, and then get attacked whenever members have differing views on individual issues even when they do agree with the broader position, or when a compromise position is allowed.",null,0,null,1431795358,null,0,false,0,crb5ao1,null,t3_35zyhu,null,t1_crb5ao1,null,t1_crayhza,null,null,null,1433098416,null,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1,null

Does your school have an account for the MyMaths website? That's a pretty useful resource, full of videos explaining all the different topics. It's definitely worth finding out about.

Which exam board are you on? I assume OCR, since you've mentioned that. Try doing a past paper, marking it, and then focus on teaching yourself the areas where you lost the most marks.

You could probably also find a few guides online, and maybe there's people on reddit who are willing to help explain things to you. As far as I know, you should get an equation sheet with most of the more difficult equations for trigonometry, but I'm with Edexcel, and that could be different for other exam boards.

Also! Seeing as you're running out of time, one way to try and maximise the work you do is to really focus on the bits that will help you most. If you think something is impossible, and you'll never get it, it might be best not to waste your time on it; instead, learn about the things that you find quite difficult, but could be able to do with a bit of effort. (You should also pay attention to things that are likely to be worth a lot of marks though.)

Finally, it could be worth seeing about getting a predictive paper. I assume your exam is split into a calculator and non calculator section? Some organisations create predictive papers based on the topics that come up in whichever is released first - ie, if there's a calculator paper on Monday, they look at it, analyse the topics which come up, compare it to all the topics that are on the course, and then decide which topics are likely to come up on the non calculator paper on Thursday. That might be something you should look into, either online, or asking teachers, etc.

Playing in the Championship won't change anything. We'll play the same football, with less exciting players, but just get better results. Supporting a club is about going through the ups *and* downs. Playing in the championship would mean losing Benteke, Delph, Grealish, Cleverley. All our exciting players. Maybe even Tim.

You think we'll get investment as a championship team? There would be no television deal, no new ownership. Attendances would probably go down, and running Villa Park isn't free. This year especially is bad to have gone down. The massive new TV deal is happening this summer, premier league clubs will be getting funds from that. 

Tim has led us to 7 wins in 14 matches... 22 points in 14, which spread over a season is going to put us at about 55-62 points. That puts us at about 8th - 5th place (based on this season). Obviously it won't be that simple, but Tim Sherwood has led us onto the form of Tottenham of last year (6th place). To say we are going to be drab and dreary is unfair. Benteke has hit form, Grealish is playing consistently, Delph, Westwood and Cleverley are forming a nice trio in midfield. We have Gil and Sinclair who can add additional flair. Bring back Clark to fitness, plus spend some money to solidify the back line, and suddenly we have a completely solid team. 

TL;DR: I disagree.

Regarding food, I met a friend today living in Reading and they said they spend around £300 / month for the 3 of them (2 adults, 1 kid) so for my calculations I think it is safer to budget more. I prefer the safer approach :)

How much do you pay for the house? How can you pay more for nursery than for the house? That sounds scary. People told me I should budget around £1000 for house... I can't imagine paying similar just for nursery! Is there anything public for kids below age of 2? I was told today that kids below 3 can get couple hours a  day for free and after the age of 3 the childcare is for free? I might be mixing childcare and nursery here, I'm not really sure. If so, can you clarify a bit on this topic? My kid is 1,5 years old.

Costs to include - how much for each of them or overall? Maybe you could help me with the below? I'd appreciate that a lot.

* Electricity, gas, water, council tax - no idea
* Phones x2 - no idea
* Rent - £1000
* Internet - no idea
* car insurance - no idea
* tv / satellite licence - no idea (they're not the same?)
* food - £300

Regarding drivers licence, national insurance number - my company will help me to obtain all of that. I don't have to bother about that.

And what, really, is the differnece betwen top 5/6 and finishing just a place or two above the relegation zone? It is all the same, it is all mid-table nothingness.  We finished in that spot, we quality for the UEFA cup, and then we played the kids as the club were not interested in being there. Therefore, what the hell is the difference in being 5/6 or in the bottom few? Rather than taking that position and building on it, we went backwards.

Thats subjective. It will change how I personally see the game, it will be a change, it will be different, it will be exciting... it wont be the same old playing for mid-table nothingness. Thats what I want. I want excitement.

They don't want to just block one illegal torrent site, or 10, or 100, they want free reign to do whatever they want online (and offline) to anyone, guilty or not.

1) Lots of things could be used for illegal activity, piracy was around before thepiratebay. They block it because it's easy, and most people are stupidly happy to give up access to a free internet.

2) Your freedom of choice. Even though it harms hundreds of lives and costs the NHS thousands, but it's profitable for the government so it's okay. My point is it does more damage than one torrent site but there's no limit on how much you can buy and consume.

3) Everything is a choice between right and wrong. There will always be a way to get copies of copyright material, there always was. Blocking thepiratebay actually had a negative effect, it got so much publicity after news reported it, there are at least 20 proxies set up making it more accessible than ever. Something like netflix, amazon prime or even youtube has (imho) a much more positive effect. Most people are more than happy to pay a fair price for a fair service, I believe that's the best way to combat piracy.

On your numpties point, as an IT contractor contracting in in London for the state, I have worked with:

1) An Indian ""automation tester"" who couldn't speak English and did no automation at all. He spent much of his time telling me how his God was in a mountain.

2) A Nigerian ""automation tester"" who couldn't do any automation at all and who thought that his grandfather was 130 years old. He was literally innumerate. He brought his father (I can't remember how old he thought his father was: 90 I think; he himself was about 30) to the UK from Nigeria for cancer treatment.

3) A Ghanaian ""business analyst"" who did nothing at all.

I have nothing against these individuals per se, but it is absurd that we are letting them into our country with the effect (indeed the intention) of depressing our workers' wages. The only reason to admit them not contrary to the facts is a principled objection to the hereditary privilege that British workers have in access to the British labour market, which is what motivates most of the left-wing love of immigration.

null,false,Baggzio,newcr-1,You Signed Lambert We Signed No One At All!!,null,"Howard - GO. There's no point in us keeping a player who's playing bad at his age as he's only going to decline and leave a sour taste on everyone when he eventually does leave like Distin is. 

Hibbo - GO. He's just not good enough really and he's been kept around on sentiment. I'd hope he'd just retire because it'd be unfair to force him out. 

Distin- GO. He's basically already gone. 

Oviedo - GO. Honestly he's not going to take over Baines and it seems that leg break could've really done him for the rest of his career potentially. If he could stay fit and maybe play more as a winger I'd keep him but as a left back I'd prefer a youngster be Baines understudy and get a few million for Oviedo. 

Gibbo-  GO (unless he can somehow keep his fitness) I think we all know that Gibbo is class but he's made of glass. (That rhymed) Anyway I'd love to keep him but if it meant getting a few bob for him then I'd probably let him leave. He's already fulfilled what we've paid for him so I'd let him go but not that I want him to leave it's just it'd be best for all parties in my opinion. 

McGeady- STAY. I've always wanted McGeady to come good because I know what he's capable of and I do believe while he's never going to be the best he's a really good option to have behind Kev. Also we wouldn't get our money's worth selling him now anyway so it'd be a bit of a pointless sale as we'd probably not replace him. 

Barry- GO (if he would be played every game next season) I really think he'd be a good squad player but unfortunately Martinez seems to think that he's able to start every game. We'd definitely get a good MLS offer for him if we put him out there and I think that'd be best. 

Barkley- STAY (unless massive offer comes in) I think Ross will eventually become one of the best players in England but it just hasn't happened for him this season. I think a bit of a break and refocusing will help he become the player we all know he can be. That being said if someone wants to come in and offer stupid money for him then I honestly couldn't refuse as he is replaceable. 

Pienaar- GO. He's just too old and past it to be a good player for us anymore. I think it'd be best if he freed up the space for a new player to come in. 

Naismith- GO. It's not that he's been bad but we probably would get good enough money for him and he hasn't exactly been in great form the second half of the season. A bottom half PL team would definitely take him for good money and we wouldn't really be devastated by the loss. 

Kone- GO. He just hasn't been anywhere near good enough to play for us and should leave. A new or lower PL team might take the chance on him so we might recoup some of the money wasted on him. 

Lennon- STAY (for the right price) To be fair he's an outsider for our player of the season which shows how poor we've been as he joined mid way through. Definitely would keep him on and get a good 3 years out of him but not for stupid money. 

Joel- GO (unless he's made #1) I'm taking a different view to this as I'd like him to go if he's still behind Howard as it's unfair because he's too good to be a backup. Would get into a lot of PL sides and Spanish sides so unless he's made #1 I'd like him to leave to further his career as he deserves to be first choice somewhere I just hope it'll be with us.

I ended up cancelling it because I was getting too many things that I wasn't using or duplicates. For example, sometimes it seems as though they put the less popular colours of things in to get rid of them which was annoying when it was a brilliant product but in bright orange or something. You also fill in a survey so that they can kind of tailor your boxes but I found I was getting duplicates because of this - I think I ended up with about 5 different mascaras  from boxes in the last few months before I quit.

How about pride? Excitement? Finishing 5th means we were the 5th best team in England. It means we played well, beat teams, competed with the top teams. We can be proud that we were able to consistently perform at the highest level.

&gt; Rather than taking that position and building on it, we went backwards.

So we should take another **leap** backwards? Yeah, we made mistakes. O'Neill should not have been let go, big names should not have been sold. But that doesn't mean we should just give up, say we're not good, and settle for an easier opponent. We have the ability to compete with the best. Especially now, we have solid managerial staff, awesome youth talent, and the potential to win a major trophy. How is that not good enough for you? 

&gt; it wont be the same old playing for mid-table nothingness.

*Maybe* not. Have you seen Wigan? Relegated. Reading? 19th. Fulham? 17th. Cardiff? 11th. Lower table struggles. Mid-table obscurity. If we go down, we lose our squad. We will likely be playing for a mid-table finish... just against worse opposition.

I don't think you realize what a lack of investment does to a club. That doesn't just mean it's hard to get promoted again. Like I said before, we would lose our squad. Anybody who is slightly good, or paid more than 20/25 thousand a week will be sold. Not just that, but our academy (which is an awesome academy) would not get funding. Obviously nothing is a guarantee, but it is likely we would lose a lot of what makes Villa the Villa we know today.

&gt; Next season will be the same and you are kidding yourself if you think anything else.

No. I'm fine with a tough season (and I'm not saying we'll be a top team next season), but Sherwood has improved our playing style, players have confidence, and we made it to the FA Cup final. With the changes we've made this season, I would call it successful.

The No side in Scotland start from a stronger position than the No side in Canada - you guys won by 10%, whereas your equivalent in Canada won by less than 1%. And yet independence is moving further and further away from Quebec - the generation that voted Yes in the '90's is still in favour, but they are in their 50's and younger generations are firmly no. The No people in Scotland should take heart that the 16 year olds all voted No - they want the right to work anywhere in the UK without feeling they are going abroad.

Also, the oil thing creates a huge problem for the yes people.

Canadian politics again, but Alberta, which is the Texas of Canada had a big shock election just days after our own general election. They kicked out the incumbent Conservatives due to the oil price crash. Basically all incumbents are in trouble in places that rely mainly on oil when the price crashes.

&gt; I expect that the grandchildren have different funds as I know that some of the grandchildren have done much worse (a younger child has more money than some of the older)

Because the younger one can afford to leave assets in a more risky position.

DIY investing is cheaper, but if your grandmother doesn't know much about the funds, its likely she just wants someone else to deal with it. No offence, and what you want to do is great, but people always get a greater peace of mind when dealing directly with a professional - even if they may be financially worse off.  

I'm in a similar predicament - and I was once tempted to do the same. I just decided it wasn't worth the hassle and the burdening risk on myself. I'm in a very good position to give financial advice, but I just did not want to directly interfere with my grandparents investments. It starts to get messy, and it feels a little rude to intrude. It would also make them feel a little guilty for making a wrong decision. I'm just going to wait for them to ask, rather than offer my services.

There are all sorts of potential issues here, to name just a few that come to mind:

You are using wifi, are you near the router? who else is using the router, and for what?

The quality of the wiring between the master socket and the router - this is your responsibility. Poorly wired extensions and bad filters can have a massive impact. Try doing a speedtest from a wired connection with the router plugged into the master socket.

The distance from the exchange to the mastersocket. Look at SamKnows.com to find this out.

How many other people in the area are using the network, in this case Sky's equipment. Only they will know the answer to this, and they're unlikely to tell you.

You don't give us any indication of what sort of package you are even on. Remember even if it is advertised as fibre its usually only ever fibre to the cabinet and then the ancient copper wire to your house, apart from some very new properties in London.

If you can eliminate the issues above and still get poor speeds then it's worth reporting the issue to Sky (they will run through the above before they bother to go forward anyway). They should be able to see any issues on the line or on their parts of the network. They may need to then contact Openreach (formerly BT) to send an engineer out to address any issues between Sky's equipment in the exchange / cabinet and your house, *if* this is the issue.

The problem is, next week was meant to be our relaxing game, a game in which we dont need to try (still dont really). A game we could go out, loose and the fans wouldnt be too bothered, rest some weary legs and get ready for the FA cup. 
But like ive said, after that performance the players need to play well next week just to keep their heads up, we cant go to wembley on back to back loses. 
The players should be celebrating right now, their spirits should be high because we have just secured safety, but any player celebrating would need a major wake up call. I imagine they all left today with their heads hung in shame, sherwood doesn't seem like the type of manager to let a result like that go.

He isn't going to turn and scamper in behind so there's really no reason not to just have at least one player crawling up his ass at all times. 

The solution of course is to test the back line more with runs in behind. I still think Kane potentially operates best as a second striker playing a bit off quicker players. I think if we sign a forward to supplement Kane it should be someone in the mold of Hueng Min Son. Obviously we won't be signing him, but he's someone who can play anywhere across the front three and has good pace.

null,false,Asian_Emperor,,History is bollocks,null,"Are you a year 10 doing Maths GCSE a year early then? There must be a reason as to why that's so (you must be better at Maths than you allow yourself). I think that the first thing you should do, instead of worrying about your situation, is that **you are a year 10 taking GCSE Maths a year early**. Even if you do not do well in this exam, you have the opportunity to redo it next year with the rest of your year, you have the exam experience so it should lighten the pressure and you will ace it next year if you lose out this year. But I guess you really want to smash this exam :p.  
  
If you haven't already, start your revision sooner rather than later since very minute will help (but obviously do not overload). A lot of what you need to learn is method based mathematics, only requiring one or two steps to solve and whilst these are quite hard to understand at first, you will crack it and commit it to memory once you know how to do it, just like riding a bike! If you can't understand how to do the basics then a **last resort** would be to only learn how to solve them (e.g. memorising the method and using it to solve the question rather than understanding the method and applying).  
  
I think that the best method to is to mill through past papers and focus on the questions that you do not understand, highlight the relevant content of the questions and try and understand what you need to do to find the answer, in GCSE they heavily hint at the solution in the question so read carefully! A tactic that I used to use was to flick through papers and find questions I didn't understand, work out what the question was asking via highlighting words of significance, remembering the method (or looking up what I think the method would be) and writing it down on some paper, working out the answer and then checking the mark scheme to see if I had the correct solution. If I didn't, I would work out the method to answer the question, move on to another question in the paper then coming back and reattempt to solve the first question. This helped me a lot and was incredibly efficient!  
  
Mymaths is also a very effective website to helping you understand those topics since they walk you through the method step by step and you can apply this to a worksheet that you can do on the website.  
  
Also use resources in school and ask your teachers, start attending the lunchtime and breaktime help sessions, your teachers are there for a reason!
  
I think getting to learn the topics and the main methods/areas that span the topics is the #1 priority but honestly you shouldn't worry about this exam too much since you're taking it a year early and have another opportunity if you fall short on this one, I wish you the best of luck!",null,0,null,1431800584,null,0,false,0,crb7y9k,null,t3_366e5b,null,t1_crb7y9k,null,t3_366e5b,null,null,null,1433099667,null,1,false,GCSE,t5_2u3gk,1,null

What is the problem here? It is far more possible to fake an evil conspiracy and get away with it than it is to actually get away with the conspiracy. If they would be able to get away with the conspiracy, then someone could also have faked it.

The downside of Saville and the rest of Yewtree is not just a loss of faith in our politicians, but of our journalists as well, as they were unable to bring truth to the light despite that being the primary point of their jobs. After decades of Blairism, the Saville revelations, and everything else, the public are as distrustful of the media and news as we are of the political class. 

In short, we distrust the story, the people telling it, and the reasons for doing so as much as we distrust the people who are accused of doing it.

Sadly due to the T&amp;C, you are bound by a contract stating that you do have to pay the remainder of the service if you wish to cancel before the agreed minimum term. However as stated in section K1, providing you give 30 days notice to change residency to another property they will do so as long as it's in the agreed service area.

So, you won't be able to cancel unless you pay the full fee for the remainder of the contract, however you can change the service address to your MIL providing she is covered in her area.

http://store.virginmedia.com/the-legal-stuff/terms-and-conditions-for-fibre-optic-services.html#home

However, feel free to kick up a stink. Personally I would, be polite. As a bargaining tool, my brother recently had his service terminated prematurely by Virgin Media as they're ""no longer covering his area due to wanting to focus more on the mobile aspect of the company and pursuing the advancement of the Virgin Mobile division.""

If they can cancel a sub mid term due to no longer covering the service area, then why can't you? However, you would have agreed to these terms when you signed up. So on a legal front, they may be really nice and you may back them into a situation where they see it's in their best interest to cancel yourself than the money they will gain from you. In the same call, feel free to log the cancelation for the end of the minimum term. 

You mention that golden word of ""cancelation"" and want it processed for the earliest date your contract allows, they may start pulling out some retention tools which would result in a discount.

Good luck, hopefully you'll get a half decent outcome from this :)

Gutted for Stevie, it shouldn't have happened like this but looking back I'm not exactly sure what we should have expected. Aside from half a dozen games (all season) we have been pretty lack luster/flat.

There is no cohesion in the team. We have no 'style'. We aren't a counter attacking team, we are pretty unimaginative when we try to hold onto it - or flat out just give away possession too much, and there frighteningly little signs of synergy or understanding by a majority of our players after almost a full year together.

I'm afraid this season has asked far too many questions than what can be answered in the next couple of months, but something drastic needs to be done. I'm not suggesting what, I will leave that for better and more well informed people to decide.

Thank you Stevie, truly and honestly.

Even the one I pay for I don't read the political sections. I literally couldn't give a shit, even though all of the papers; the telegraph, the times, the express and even red tops all claim not to have a political opinion and they all do. If they're slating anyone and praising anyone in the political sphere they have an opinion more one sided than the other.

I read all the free ones and the one I pay for, for actual journalism, like the issue with migrants stranded on boats or people leaving their lives behind to fight for/against ISIS. I am genuinely interested in the articles, not the paper. Not the write. Don't get me wrong, I'll occasionally pick up papers like the times to read clarksons column because I miss his humour and he conveys it in his writing. Same with the telegraph when they do some of their segments about the engineering and business improvements. Do I agree with any papers political stance or moral stand point who owns them? No. Murdoch isn't a good man, but I wasn't overtly thrilled by the telegraphs journalism covering the German press conference when they sent someone who doesn't speak German. As funny as it was to read it. It wasn't my brew.

As for the longevity of papers? Physical will be dead within 50 years. It's a generational game now. People of my generation are not by the stance of reading a paper in the morning with their breakfast before work or on a Sunday morning with a brew. We're the digital age. So even the paid for services need to up their game and drop their prices. Yes journalism can be expensive. But some of the monthly costs are absurd for what you get. Why would I pay for something that I can literally get for free? If all I'm reading is the actual news and not hyperbole bullshit then the BBC *was*     providing that.

The Coalition stopped doing austerity halfway through their term. They called it plan B and the current economic condition is because of that. If the Tories go back to austerity and the economy flatlines, then I guess that would be it for them. Not many people voted for them and their key advantage is the perception of economic competence.

The Tories despite their success have huge issues to deal with in this parliament. They have a slimmer majority than Major did in '92 and all of his problems. In fact it's even worse. The eurosceptic wing already don't trust Cameron on the EU and he couldn't control even with the Lib Dems backing him. Now he's meant to see negotiation, EU reform and a referendum. It's a once in a lifetime referendum. They aren't going to let him screw them over. If they end up fighting like the Tories in the '90s or Labour in mid '00s, passing laws about English votes and Boundary changes won't save them.

So, on the basis that foxes are a pest and as a nation we require the continual removal of foxes from our countryside, is fox hunting with dogs *more* cruel than any other practicable method of killing foxes? The answer to this is ""not necessarily"". Shooting foxes can wound them leaving them to bleed out over days, snaring them can result in a painful death via dehydration over a week or so, while killing with dogs can result in dogs tearing out their throats.

[Redefining 'unemployed' to mean 'obtaining JSA'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-32444799) by the tories.

And [here](http://www.scriptonitedaily.com/2013/08/06/1-million-jobless-left-out-of-uk-govt-unemployment-figures/) is a comprehensive article on exactly how the conservatives re-tweak the unemployment figures to make themselves look good. Such as 'workfare' and Zero-hour contracts


[18 leaving age](http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/parents/education_after_16/)  2013-15

[Students are no longer eligible for benefits](http://www.nus.org.uk/en/advice/money-and-funding/can-i-claim-government-benefits-as-a-student/) as of 2013

Though I haven't found specifics, it's a guaranteed guess the tuition fee boost forced a LOT of people straight into university in 2011/2012, which keeps them out of the unemployment right up until 2015, and Zero-hour contracts allow thousands of people to be 'employed' while never actually getting to work or getting paid.

I know from personal experience when these things happened. My sisters were the first to be hit with 'gotta stay in education until 18' and I discovered first hand that students aren't eligible for benefits when I took a gap year in 2013-2014. And since 2011 my town's dominoes and spartacus stores have had permanent 'hiring' signs in their windows, they just throw out a zero-hour to anyone who asks because they never have to actually give out a shift. Dozens of people 'employed', none actually working.

You have a younger incarnation of himself being the mature one and when Ten heard ""sand shoes"" you could see the annoyance on his face.  He wanted to be young and vibrant and electric but he also needed to start acting his age.  Sure, he had a suit and a trenchcoat, serious business, just like his previous incarnations but then that one quirky bit (aside from his hair) were his sneakers.  The sneakers kept him from feeling like an old man.  Plus, the sneakers were an attempt to try and seperate himself from Nine who was basically a no nonsense war vet with PTSD.  Ten was still a war vet with PTSD but like most going through a mid-life crisis, he went and put on some youthful shoes.  Maybe even a first step at getting back to a normal life.

Perhaps they aren't supposed to be comparable, but for volume of international news the New York Times vastly outstrips anything British, including the BBC. It's a shame the NYT website isn't fully free any more. For depth you can also do better than the daily papers - try magazines such as the Economist and Spectator.

It's just that the reward is Europa rather than premier league, because we already have the premier league. Whether or not we take it super seriously, it is an accomplishment.  To have qualified means we had an awesome season.

You keep avoiding my points though. Every week I watched nervously as the team I love competed in tough, well fought matches. Sure, we lost some matches badly, but the development in the team made it all worth it. Tim's battle to keep us in the premier league had me excited every week. Every benteke goal had me in a mixture of giggles and tears. Clev's sudden rise to the occasion, scoring three in three had me cheering in the middle of work. I nearly cried when Clark went down injured. 

I suffered heartbreak and joy in such a roller coaster ride, and the longer the heartbreak, the sweeter the joy. I love the villa. Every game was intense, every game was entertaining.
If you are telling me you were not entertained by Villa **at all** this season, I think you're supporting the wrong club.

Where we finish doesn't make all the difference. Like I said, being upper mid-table is different from being 17th because it means more of the moments of happiness in victory.

I agree offensively he has a lot of improvement to make. He passed well but they were always 10 or 15 yard, ""simple passes"" which shows he doesn't risk losing the ball but it also meant that we couldn't break quickly or spread the defense out with a quality ball over the top.  About 2 months ago when Gibson came on for him (i think it was a Europa have), at first I didn't like the decision, but you could immediately see the attacking improvement with Gibson's long balls.  

Tbf besic was originally a CB who also played DM. So he is not playing in his most natural role.

Even at the very start, a business owner relies on other people's skill - especially at the start in fact since by definition the first time you do it you have no idea how.

The propaganda around this issue has been very effective. People dramatically over-estimate the percentage of benefits money that is spent on fraudulent claims. I've never seen any figure which suggests that it is more than 1% of expenditure, and it dwindles into insignificance next to tax avoidance and other forms of fraud generally. Meanwhile, people think benefits fraud accounts for up to a quarter of benefits expenditure, according to at least one poll. Whilst I don't think benefits fraud is ethical, it's at such a low level that, whilst the DWP should still absolutely pursue fraudulent claimants, it should really be mostly looked at as an operating inefficiency, especially from the policy-making side of things. It's also worth considering the extent to which benefits fraud is motivated by inadequacies in the benefits system. The new, highly punitive sanctions regime put into place by the last government is inevitably going to lead to more people falsifying (for example) job search records in order to avoid sanctions. I think the underlying assumption a lot of people seem to have is that if someone is sanctioned enough they'll be forced to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, but in many areas the number of jobs and the population simply do not add up, and someone who has no job or means of income cannot simply travel to another area or relocate.

I agree that rodgers is responsible for motivating and getting the best out of them in training and in games. There have been some posts fairly recently that suggest the transfer committee has more say than rodgers in who we bring in despite rodgers having the final say... I think rodgers is doing the best he can with a squad that is probably overdue for an overhaul. 

I respect that your opinion is different. I think rodgers deserves one more summer and one more season before he gets the sack. Personally I think if we could get klopp we need to grab him, but if not now (this summer) then i think rodgers is the man.

Threatening letters and home visits are made to scare people. They misrepresent the law and overstate the BBC's agents (Capita) rights. You don't have to speak to them or let them into your home. You don't have to tell them your name, confirm your address or let them inspect your equipment. Just don't speak to them.

They have a history of distorting information that is given, breaking their own policies and guidelines, writing lies onto their recording forms and misleading courts to obtain warrants or secure convictions for non-payment of the TVL. It is best to never speak to them, at all, ever.

Unless they show up accompanied by a police officer and a search warrant with your name and address on it. Which they won't. In which case video record the whole process for your own protection.

However in your case, as you have a TVL and do watch live broadcast TV you might enjoy writing to them and being Mr Angry.

You can pretty much bullshit anything in English literature as long as you know the themes and can back it up with quotes. My English teacher says that if you can back something up with 3 levels of analysis/thoughts with a far reaching opinionated thought then that would hit top band. Here is something I just bullshitted:


Of Mice and Men is structured in a cyclical structure, with “two men emerged from the path and came into the opening by the green pool” - pg4, first time we meet Lennie and George and “The deep green pool of the Salinas River was still” - end of the novel, pg 98.

The cyclical structure represents the reality that the stories of discrimination seen against characters is present across all of 1930s America, suggesting that the discriminated against characters are a microcosm for them throughout all of America.

The Cyclic structure also symbolises that mankind's actions are insignificant compare to nature, and whatever happens to mankind contrasts to the constant peace of nature.

I think the Cyclic structure could also represent the repetative predatory nature of 1930s America, and how those who are vulnerable in any way do not fit into mankind's narrative. It being placed alongside the natural setting of the pond represents the 'survival of the fittest' theory in nature, whereby organisms are constantly killed off until a superior organism evolves - the weak organisms being those who are weak in society.",null,0,null,1431809071,null,0,1431809683,0,crbc0br,null,t3_366nuh,null,t1_crbc0br,null,t3_366nuh,null,null,null,1433101650,null,2,false,GCSE,t5_2u3gk,2,null

What this effectively meant was a return to what was called 'Coercion', which effectively meant measures like the suspension of Habeas Corpus in Ireland that were the antithesis of liberalism. Gladstone and many of his ministers were very reluctant to introduce the Coercive Acts to stem the tide of land agitation in Ireland, but were ultimately forced to as violence in the Ireland intensified - ultimately the coercive acts did little to stem this violence however. Ultimately Gladstone's government was overthrown in 1885 in a vote of no confidence by Irish and Conservative parties, who had agreed to ally to stop the renewal of the Acts.

Coercive Acts in Ireland weren't a new concept and had been introduced many times before, but Gladstone's introduction and attempted renewal during his Second Ministry came at a time when the Conservatives had all but abandoned them as a means of governing Ireland. It's ironic really that the Conservatives emerged as the champions of liberty against the arch-liberal W.E. Gladstone, and that Gladstone's Irish policy is all but ignored in the glorification of Gladstonian liberalism.

I've said this before on reddit but the guys on horses in red jackets and a pack of hounds were responsible for probably less than 1% of foxes hunted and killed by dogs but they are the ones that got the publicity.

Probably 99% of foxes that were hunted and killed by dogs were killed by a single (and very rarely a pair) of lurchers. Lurchers are very fast but they have thin skin and not even close to being a fighting dog. When they catch a fox they have to pin or dispatch it within seconds or the fox will just kill it and escape so there is no tearing apart or slow death involved and on the rare occasions there is it isn't the fox that gets hurt or dies.

To me the issue is whether or not foxes need controlling rather than if a gun or a dog is the best solution. Having shot and used dogs I feel a single well trained dog is less cruel. 

I do think the pack of hounds with a bunch of people on horseback should stay banned as it isn't an efficient method of control but I favour changing the law to allow people to use a single lurcher.",null,0,null,1431811715,null,0,false,0,crbd7mh,null,t3_366jwr,null,t1_crbd7mh,null,t1_crbbu5s,null,null,null,1433102217,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

Even if we give him that as a pass (which is entirely bullshit to do), please explain:

- His horrible substitutions.  They are almost always wrong.
- Tactics are poor.  3 at the back against 2 pacy winger types?  Sounds like a great plan.  At that's just this one game.  He does things like this all the time.
- In-game management.  Again, very poor here.  He's not good at changing tactics mid-game, even if does decide to actually try it (which often he doesn't).
- Inability to recognize when something isn't working.  Like splitting the CB's wide and slotting Gerrard behind them.  Or our entire first half of the season before he finally tried something different.
- Man management is all over the place.  Some seem to like him, others don't.  That's not entirely unusual as it happens that way everywhere, but his alienation of players he doesn't really like is completely unhelpful.

I'm just pointing out that during the referendum all of Labour's core voting groups - the working class, Catholics, public sector workers and even trade unionists - all turned out to vote yes while Labour was the primary force of no. As such they became disillusioned with the Labour party.

Labour failed to make a convincing case for why the worst off in Scotland should vote No and as such when the referendum was over they found their working class voters had mass-converted to the SNP ideology. They are paying the price for that mistake.

&gt;Why was Labour supporting the union seen as a betrayal of their voter base or 'joining the Tories

When people say Labour betrayed their voters they are assuming tat independence is naturally the best option for working Scots and since Labour was against independence they are against working Scots. Which I agree is a ridiculous assumption at best.

But the reason them standing with the Tories is jarring is because Labour have for years stoked a indescribably virulent anti-Tory circlejerk in Scotland to secure their position.Everyone against Labour was a tartan Tory. Vote for anyone else and you are helping the Tories. The Tories eat babies and Margaret thatcher bathes in the blood of miners etc. The Scottish tabloids all joined in.

This backfired spectacularly when the SNP co-opted their narrative with incredible success and made ""no more Tories"" their main argument for independence. Labour was forced to stand up and say that the Tories were actually not so bad after all. And even went further to defend Tory policies and ride around arm in arm with the politicians they vilified for decades. And immediately after the referendum they adopted the same old anti-Tory tone again attacking policies they had just defended. It exposed the extreme superficiality of Scottish Labour and solidified the viewpoint that the Tories and Labour and Lib Dems are all the same anyway.

**Tl;dr** Labour are paying the price for their own mistakes because the SNP is shrewd enough to use their own narratives against them.",null,0,null,1431811993,null,0,1431812686,0,crbdc4b,null,t3_365woh,null,t1_crbdc4b,null,t1_crbcd15,null,null,null,1433102275,null,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17,null

* Clyne and Bertrand managed to actually get up and putting crosses in like no-ones business, always up there linking play, it was awesome. Especially as Villa can have some pacey counter players on the wings (how they beat us last season at home), managed them all perfectly.  
* We rarely looked threatened, and their goal wasn't the defenders' fault, Benteke reached about 15ft high for that header. Seriously hope we can keep Alderweireld. Wonder if Fonte starts to slow down how he'll do with Yoshida... or Van Dijk?  
* Prowse can sometimes go missing in matches, but he's young and he always provides a good pass and link up play, let's hope this season was a bit of a blip because of his injury and he'll continue his development to the player we all know and hope he can be.
* Mané seems to decide on a game by game basis. Some games he's fine, fights and doesn't just go down, some games he's trying to Tom Daley the shit out of the grass.  
* Always looks so happy, and great to see the striker score any day, great finish on the volley after getting that yard on the defender.
* Davis wasn't quite the holding midfielder we thought he might be after seeing the formation, he palyed more of a Schneiderlin engine/transitional role and it did him a world of good.
* Wanyama is always a beast.
* He made a couple of decent enough saves and also took a couple of crosses, one hoofed ball forward that could have been dangerous he claimed like a boss.
* I actually think Djuricic might be worth the money in his buy-out clause if it is the rumoured £12m. It's very hard to say, but Koeman wanted him because of his performances in Holland, at when he's been on he has often been our brightest start. I think we could do far worse than him and that he could well be a great creative midfielder given a good run - exactly what we need.

Plenty more if you think about PR in general and not a specific system

How does every country with PR and coalition governments get anything done?

&gt; More people would vote Green and UKIP, since tactical voting does nothing any more, so parliament would be a lot more evenly spread.

That's an assumption based on the current system presumably. We might vote differently if we had PR.

Do I think he can consistently have us being a ""top 4 team""? I don't think there's any manager in the world who consistently finish in the top 4 when it requires overhauling teams with more resources and pulling power. Klopp and Rafa, I believe, would have us finishing 5th more often than not, working with the same relative weaknesses Rodgers is in comparison with the teams above us. 

Winning something? Again, I absolutely don't think there's a manager out there capable of winning the league with us as it stands. Rodgers massively overachieved last season and even that wasn't good enough in the end. We've danced around the league a couple of times over the years, but I think there's been massive elements of luck involved each time, and we've still been pipped because there's too many teams that are superior to us for them all to let us in. Klopp nor Rafa would win us the league. It would take a miracle more than good management. Cups? I could see Rafa performing better than Rodgers but I still think there's a large enough element of luck that we could easily win some under Rodgers, I still think Rodgers has scope and the ability to learn there.

Ultimately, I'm willing to give Rodgers time because I think the pattern of overachieving followed by sobering seasons is the same that will occur with any manager. If Rodgers isn't able to lift us out of 5th again then he should be gone.

We are playing a little bit better than we were 10 games ago, but nothing like last season. Why should we give pellegrini another year when he's shown us so many bad signs?

Ah now, no need to be even more of a massive cunt than you already have been.

&gt;For some people it's fun to watch

Doesn't make it a good thing for society. People like to steal, but that's a pretty pathetic reason to endorse theft. 

&gt;For some people its a ""sport"" to gamble on

Arguably a bad thing for society, and we have no shortage of sports to gamble on. Dog fighting adds nothing here.

&gt;For some people it's a way of earning money through venue costs, drinks income, or other cover charges

Not specific enough to dog fighting to warrant association with it. You could say this about literally anything. 

&gt;For some owners it gives a sense of pride that their dog is the best dog and may bring income depending on the organisation of the fight.

You're scraping the barrel here. More so than you were before.

All in all a very poor attempt at defending the argument that dog fighting can be a good thing for a modern society to entertain. As I said, there are no genuinely positive implications for dog fighting, other than a pretty feeble argument regarding a non-existent betting market. For somebody so bright, you don't seem to be able to compose a convincing argument very well.

I do agree that Labour would have collapsed though. They have been slowly declining for some time for the exact same reasons. The SNP's argument was slowly winning over the Labour post-industrial heartlands. The referendum was just a catalyst that caused this to happen infinitely faster. It caused an unprecedented mass political engagement which allowed the SNP to propogate it's ideas to the masses far more effectively than it could have through conventional politics.

The core problem is that Labour provides no ideological opposition whatsoever. They just provide blanket opposition to the tiniest things the SNP does while trying to steal their policies and running away from SNP attack points. Trident is the classic example. Scotland has completely gone over to the SNP position on this because Labour will not defend nuclear weapons at all and allows the SNP to relentlessly assault it with no opposition.

But I am not really comfortable with signing KDB, and playing him on the wing. He doesn't have required pace, nor he is that better technically than our current players (again, from what I have seen, I might be wrong). His stats are incredible this season, but those aren't everything. In our team, he will often play against the teams that are a lot more defensive minded, and will restrict the space avaliable, so I don't think that its guaranteed that he'll have that many assists and goals in PL.

Now Bale. He is a world class already, he has the qualities that we lack in our team (pace, directness, strength). Proven in PL, after a bad season in Madrid he will be 10 times more motivated to show his class if he joins this summer. There are many factors that influence his performance at Real, I still rate him very highly.

So yeah, KDB is fine as Nasri replacement, young and better attitude, but I'd not pick him over Bale if we're looking for a wide player. I don't want Silva to play on the wing, nor do I want KDB to rotate with him in the middle.

- Labour wanted to increase taxes on the top end, I don't see why those who are wealthy enough to weather the storm shouldn't feel the brunt of austerity. Perhaps you disagree?
- Labour wanted to institute a mansion tax on the most high valued properties, again targeting the more well off to pay for austerity.
- The Conservatives meanwhile already cut the top rate of tax &amp; are planning to give further savings to the wealthy by cutting inheritance tax. This all the while implementing massive crushing cuts to the government budget, primarily in welfare spending *that has already had to bear the brunt of the cuts in the last parliament*. They also increased VAT, an incredibly regressive taxation system that should be abolished not increased. 

You paint this picture that all pensioners are vulnerable frail people. What about the pensioners that have massive pension pots but still get the state pension? Do you think that the pension should be increased but means tested instead? This would help those that actually need the pension to live more comfortably. It's evidently clear the current system is unsustainable, pension spending has increased from 5% of the government budget in the 50s to 10% by the 70s and 20% that it is today. Then you have health care spending that has increased to a similar level (just under 20% currently). 

Perhaps pensioners should have some respect for working age people that have had their benefits cut year on year while pensioner benefits have been increasing above inflation. Their generation could afford to buy houses &amp; live comfortably on minimum wage while this is no longer possible. Their generation had free education while now it's deemed too expensive. Now almost 40% of the government budget is used on things I, as a young person, barely even use (namely healthcare &amp; pensions). How the heck is this fair? They tell me we can't afford to fund university education but then increase healthcare &amp; pension funding year on year.

Stridex is pretty drying, that will not be helping your hydration goals. Conversely it may not be working as well as you hope: after oil cleansing you should remove all the oil, I don't see how that is possible with a cotton pad. The full OCM involves a clean flannel, steaming and hot water.

With sunscreen ensure you are applying *and reapplying* the recommended amount (at least half a teaspoon for face and neck, more if your decollete is exposed).

Lastly review your diet and lifestyle choices, ensure you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations. When using sunscreen (and from October to April when UVB in sunlight is weak) oily fish is particularly important for the bioavailable vitamin D and long chain omega-3s. Experts advocate up to four servings a week.

2) Did the shop know that these were bridesmaid dresses for that wedding?
3) Did the shop ever (even after the wedding) try to deliver the dresses (even if they had to be taken back for re-alteration, or it was the day before the wedding and you'd already bought replacements)?

If the answers are yes-yes-no, you need to write a letter before claim to the shop. Be firm but polite, and state the dates on which you ordered the dresses, remind them that you'd informed them of the wedding date (maybe tell them which assistant you spoke to), and tell them that they failed to deliver the dresses on time in breach of contract, and as a result you're claiming a refund. Warn them that if they don't refund you within 14 days you will issue proceedings.

If they don't refund you, go to moneyclaimonline.gov.uk, and follow the steps. It's cheap and easy, and you've got a straightforward claim.

&gt;__The Proms__, more formally known as __The BBC Proms__, or __The Henry Wood Promenade Concerts presented by the BBC__, is an eight-week summer season of daily orchestral classical music concerts and other events held annually, predominantly in the [Royal Albert Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Albert_Hall) in London. Founded in 1895, each season currently consists of more than 70 concerts in the Albert Hall, a series of [chamber concerts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_music) at [Cadogan Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadogan_Hall), additional Proms in the Park events across the United Kingdom on the last night, and associated educational and children's events. In 2009 the total number of concerts reached 100 for the first time. In the context of classical music festivals, [Jiří Bělohlávek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji%C5%99%C3%AD_B%C4%9Blohl%C3%A1vek) has described the Proms as ""the world's largest and most democratic musical festival"".

Licensed work for hire music pools weren't really around back then as a whole and it was much cheaper to keep people on staff to compose for tv shows. Doctor Who's earliest composers included Rob Grainer and Delia Derbyshire.

Also, ""Generic"" space music wasn't really a thing back then either. While science fiction did have a surge of movies in the 40s and 50s, these movies didn't feature a lot of music by any stretch of the imagination, and not many of them used electronic music by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, the advent of melody-less spacy electronic music was actually a huge musical movement based off aleatoric music that was far from the norm or even widely known about, much less mainstream. Other science fiction shows of the time such as star trek used orchestras at the time. 

As a result, its far from fair to call the music in early doctor who generic in the sense that it wasn't a normal idea to use electronic music in scifi or fair to call it generic in that electronic, spacy music wasn't really something that was well known enough to be called generic.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"There's a lot of problems with these *""what if""* threads;

* I will concede, as I'm sure most people will, that the election suffered from a ""presumed"" outcome of a hung parliament due to the (obviously) inaccurate polling that was going on in the run up. This meant a lot of voters may have been voting for what they thought was the ""tactical"" choice based on polling data.

* Having said that though, these ""what if"" analysis articles tend to skirt around one important thing... 2984 Green voters **didn't** vote labour. It isn't clear if they ever would have... even if the had the Tories would still have only been shy of a majority by 1 seat... and they'd have scope for about 8 lost seats with DUP seats, and another 8 from a presumed lib-dem coalition. The bottom line is that labour fell well short of touching the tories who clearly seized a decisive victory, even if it was by narrow margins... **you shouldn't walk away from this article thinking if just 3000 people had voted differently, we'd have a different government... because we probably wouldn't**. If 2 million people had voted different (I'm looking at you Scotland) *then* the outcome *might* have been different.

* You can potentially extend similar logic to ""what if""  x^(small number) of UKIP voters had voted Tory in certain key marginals. 

* Lets not forget the elephant in the room, what if there hadn't been huge 30% swings to the SNP in Scotland... what if labour hadn't alienated its key middleground, what if labour had a more personable leader?

It all becomes redundant, because the bottom line is those things didn't happen. The only real message we can take away from this is something that people already should have known - **1) take the polls with a pinch of salt because they aren't always right and 2) vote for who you want to win, because tactical voting can have unpredictable (and undesired) results**.

News printed on paper isn't clickable. (Duh!)

Shortened/punny/sensationalist headlines might be a problem, but the root of it is to do with the format itself, not with anything to do with British newspapers. 

You run a website that offers news for free. So do dozens of competitors. You need advertising revenue (or an owner willing to tolerate a loss). You then need to figure out a way to get readers to read your content, which will preferably be accompanied by the greatest number (or most noticeable) of ads. Hence clickbait. 

This isn't a problem with printed newspapers because they aren't (usually) free. You've already paid (or someone has) by the time you've seen any advert of any significant size. Hence puns/sensationalist headlines. Which isn't the same thing as clickbait, which refers to something baiting you into clicking on a story or clicking onto the next page of a story - which is an online phenomenon.

If we want to put some of that down to the contract issues, that might be fair, but we also have to put some of it down to how much he carried the team in the early months of the season. Because before Coutinho and Can/Sakho and the 3 at the back started picking our results and performances up, we had several months where Raheem was the only consistently good performer in the team. 

And considering he's played only about half his starts in his preferred positions (second-striker, AM or wide forward as opposed to central forward or wing-back) it's entirely expected for him to fall below his best - he's already picking up the slack in the places the team (or the personnel the manager selects) can't do the job. The dropping off in form has been partially down to his being worn out by the responsibility and the team's inability to cover it. 

Yeah, it wouldn't be a disaster if we had to sell him - but it's hardly an ideal situation. He, whether people want to admit it or not, has been one of our best performers this season and however you feel about him, it does us no good to rewrite history. The kid's on his way to being a fucking star, and it's bad enough to lose players once they're world class, it's another to lose our best players when they're just on their way there.

Klopp lost an important player every season for years (Sahin, Kagawa, Gotze, Lewandowski), that's far more than Rodgers has had to deal with. So I really don't see how you can use that as an excuse, it's going to happen to us and most clubs very regularly unless we can be contending for titles within the next 2 seasons which we wont be. Even if we get Klopp in we'll still have big players leaving..

&gt;We're talking about calling a man a failure before he's gotten a real shot at succeeding.

He has still been given longer than most managers at top clubs get given, 3 seasons is a pretty long time. When you spend £240m as a manager in 3 seasons you expect to not be embarrassed in Europe over 3 campaigns and to be in at least 1 cup final. Yes he had to rebuild, but he still had some amazing players at the club when he came in and only had to replace a few. 

&gt;If we hadn't come so close to taking the trophy last season on the back of FSG essentially telling fans ""steady"" when they took over, this wouldn't even be a conversation

My point is basically that he's not as good as he thinks he is and, after this season, I have some doubts about whether he will ever fulfill his potential. He can't shoot, his passing around the box is pretty bad and he's far too fond of doing step overs rather than moving the ball around to create a chance. 

I'm not sitting here saying I want him sold, but like I said before I don't think he sees us as his long term plan. I don't think the money from his sale would be smartly reinvested but in an ideal world if you asked me if I'd rather have 50m quid in the bank to spend on a boss striker and CM, or if I'd rather have this current version of Sterling, well I think I'd say that the funds would be more useful at this moment in time.

News Corp was smug as fuck especially after Jeremy Hunt was set to oversee their takeover of BskyB.

All of that changed with the Milly Dowler story. In hindsight it turned out that the allegation wasn't true. Yet this false story did more to shut down NOTW and wipe the smug smiles off Coulson and Brook than any of the honest reporting that happened before it. Nothing Hugh Grant or the other victims did had more impact than this story. Police officers in the pocket of Murdoch resigned, News Corp employees either discovered they had a soul and quit or quit to save their careers, Brooks and Coulson got arrested and News Copr admitted they were wrong.

null,false,sosr,,Labour Member,null,"Is the issue of benefits being claimed by EU migrants more perceived than real? 

Firstly, the current EU laws allow migrants to stay and claim for 3 months only, then if they don't find a job they can be sent home. If people are going to work and contribute in taxes then is it common ground that they should stay? A blanket ban on all benefits for 2 years will make it very difficult for some migrants. Surely if you can get by for 2 years you are unlikely to need them at all. This I think will require a major change to the foundation Treaties of the EU. I'd say what we need to do is to properly apply the existing rules.

Secondly, EU migrants only account for 2.5% of working age benefit claimants. That includes in work benefits like Housing Benefit and Working Tax Credits. I'm sure if you asked people what they thought the figure was they'd think it was much higher. A bit like when you ask people to guess the proportion of non-whites in Bradford or Birmingham, but inversely.

Thirdly, there are quite a lot of UK nationals claiming benefits abroad. When you look at the numbers for UK nationals claiming unemployment benefits against EU nationals claiming JSA, there is only a small 'surplus' if you like of EU nationals claiming. Interestingly there are only 1040 Romanians and 520 Bulgarians. There are 14,880 Poles, but then there are 11,222 Brits claiming in Ireland. Figures are from here: http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/19/-sp-thousands-britons-claim-benefits-eu

null,false,uhyeahreally,null,null,null,"&gt;off topic but to address your point. for my own peace of mind and as an exercise in efficiency, i like to not treat the various religions or their adherents too differently. it denies them a favourite tactic, where they retreat from reality, avoid evidence and feign superiority, by comforting themselves that, at least they're not as mad or bad as those 'other' religions. using doublespeak, is just another favourite tactic of last resort.
it would be a waste of attention to grant nuance to, and a waste of energy to take seriously, what is all essentially, delusional, normally inherited, belief in the supernatural. sure, behind those beliefs, are people of all bents whose reasoning at least deserves to be heard. in this case, a catholic moaning about historical persecution is pretty laughable.

Even starting from a perspective that all religions are mad, it doesn't make sense to regard them all as the same, any more than you would classify all mental disorders as one thing.

You attack the Catholic church, but it is only *because* Christianity changed that to have tolerance for your (now-prevailing) views became the norm.

As an atheist you have to have faith that, if different beliefs are tolerated, that people will reason their way out of religion eventually because atheism stands on its own merits- that is the point of it. To start bashing Christians because they are now the less powerful one is to defeat the whole point of opposing forced beliefs and suggests that we *need* to for some reason, thus discrediting ourselves on a social basis. If we show no appreciation for their virtues from our perspective, why should they for ours from theirs?

Demanding ""total victory"" when a more comfortable compromise could be found always comes with a cost. There is plenty of time for atheism to prevail. Religions should be the ones in a hurry, what with having to get everything sorted before the apocalypse or whatever...

For example Robots of Sherwood, I felt the episode was good, right up until the bit about the golden arrow, it didn't even make sense (at least in my mind) how firing the arrow on the _side_ of the ship would give it the boost it needed, if instead the arrow went inside the engine exhaust or something it might have been more plausible, but instead it just seemed like the arrow just ""magically"" boosted it.

For Kill the Moon, again the episode was _mostly_ good. (I hated that annoying kid) I liked seeing the tension between the characters at the end, but again, the episode pulled the ""magic"" card and said that the moon was an egg shell for a space dragon, which in my mind meant lots of plot holes with previous moon based episodes.

null,false,Helpopotamus,lfc87,,null,"From my point of view, personally. It hasn't been individual losses which have made me lose faith in Rodgers, it's a culmination of the entire season.

I accepted the poor start because we'd lost Suarez and had lots of new players to bed in. I started to get fed up in December however after 3 months of literally trying the same formation and tactics over and over again, with his unwillingness to drop under-performers like Gerrard/Lovren despite them being glaring holes in our team at the time.

To his credit, he turned it around and did what had needed to be done months before and changed our approach to work with what we had. 

We had a good period, but we became predictable again and Rodgers failed to adapt again. He stubbornly kept at it and we got royally exposed by United and Arsenal knowing how to set up against us because of Rodgers lack of versatility. Those 2 matches were crucial to our season and we'd had warning signs in the games before that we were beginning to be figured out.

People keep harping on about ""being where we should in fifth"". That line is bullshit. It ignores how the league unfolded. United, Arsenal and City have all had extremely poor area's of their season and with just a good year, we could have easily snuck into the top four. We are so fucking close despite how shit we've been for 70% of the season. We should and could have snuck it.

Cup competitions. We made it to two semi's, decent enough on paper again. 

I have no qualms with the capital one cup. We lost to the best team in England and made them work for it.

I have huge issues with the champions league. Quite frankly his tactics and team selections were diabolical and embarrassing. We had waited years to be back and we embarrassed ourselves.

The FA cup also annoyed me. We had a dream run, only having two premier league teams right? Palace and Villa. Not exactly top-tier premier league teams either. That Villa game was an utter shambles. Rodgers well and truly shit the bed tactically, changing our formation every 10 minutes and making awful subs. Great opportunity for a good cup choked.

Now we have this Palace game. Gerrard's last game at Anfield and that's the display? Steven Gerrard to me is literally a super-hero in real life. I had rough teen years and football was one of the only positive outlets for me back then. I look back on those times and I remember the shit, but I also remember Gerrard making it irrelevant. He'll never know that, but I am so thankful to that man, and I know I'm not the only one. To watch that send off hurt, and capped off a growing skepticism of Brendan Rodgers.

He's has lost out tactically, to Pulis, Sherwood, Harry Redknapp, Pardew twice and Neil Warnock this season. It's not good enough for our squad, and even under striker issues that we have had, it's not enough to justify it. 

I think Rodgers has made us a better team, but I don't think he can take us further at this stage in his career. With our growth under him expectations have risen, and just because he made them rise, doesn't mean he shouldn't be accountable when those new targets aren't met. 

The target is top four, it was achievable this season. We failed it in a very shit manner.

We failed to win a cup competition or make a go of Europe despite more good opportunities.

My little brother is a lucky charm so far, he's been to two games this season now (City and this) and we've won both, i'll make sure he's there when we win the FA cup next year.

While the team played very well, one thing I picked out as a negative (aside from our finishing, dear god that was abysmal) is that Ledley seems to have lost his ability to make a tackle. He was constantly needing Dann or Kelly to mop up for him after getting beaten far too easily, he seems to have lost the edge he had before Jedi came back from the Asian cup.

Lee is looking quite good. He gave the ball away a few times but his work rate seems great and he's got some ability as well, I think we can include him in the category of players that can pass the ball further than 5 feet (ie him, punch and cham). He's not very strong but seems to have pace, albeit not as much as he used to have pre-injuries with Bolton.

Our defense was great today, although passing the ball across the back for periods of the game justifiably made me terrified every time it happened.

Bolasie as a lone striker is not a thing and never will be, I don't care if it got him a hattrick against Sunderland.

Chamakh was pretty amazing today, you can definitely tell he's got quality about him. 

Mac was a machine in the middle as per, he's really making things happen around him.

I have hugely fond memories of Glenjo. During our dark times he was one of the few bright spots.

null,false,reddit_crunch,cnty-uk,Urffling,null,"&gt; Even starting from a perspective that all religions are mad, it doesn't make sense to regard them all as the same, any more than you would classify all mental disorders as one thing.

hold on a second...you would prefer i take great care to isolate the foolishness of one religion from another, but at the same time are happy to equate religion and mental illness as the same? religions are obviously not all the same, give me buddhism over islam any day of the week. but their root cause is all the same, a fear of the unknown and a failure to engage with evidence and reality.

&gt; it is only because Christianity changed that to have tolerance for your (now-prevailing) views became the norm.

you seem to have some sort of stockholm syndrome. i won't thank christianity for the fact that one can now live without christianity. christianity has had to be dragged kicking and screaming by scientific learning, to a point where it can now be considered the non-threatening, pocket of ever-embarrassed, ever-receding, ignorance.

&gt;As an atheist you have to have faith that, if different beliefs are tolerated, that people will reason their way out of religion eventually because atheism stands on its own merits- that is the point of it.

atheism does not demand any faith of anyone. that is not the point of atheism. atheism exists as a reaction to theism and the threat it has for too long now, posed to human progress. our historical ignorance of the universe understandably allowed supernatural belief to dominate much of our history, that religion didn't immediately pack up when long held and numerous truth claims were debunked one after another, is just sad evidence that it needs active refutation in any arena where it poses influence on the public. bad ideas once they gain enough momentum, don't necessarily die. i'm sorry to have to go all godwins law on you, but for example, if the idea of nazism was left unchallenged, most people would be living in a much bleaker world.

&gt; If we show no appreciation for their virtues from our perspective, why should they for ours from theirs?

any virtues found in religion continue to exist without it. the idea of being kind to one's neighbour, long existed before christianity, it is no excuse that other foolish reality claims be treated with kid gloves.

i think you have a confused notion of atheism and it seems to be founded mostly on the presumption that human religion and other human delusion will magically fade away without intervention, that might happen occasionally but it certainly isn't the norm.

been watchin this lad since he joined the academy and one of the stupidest things you keep saying is hes all pace. he actually has decent technique, a very good touch and a high football IQ.
not his fault he is normally the fastest guy on the pitch. he has played well for us at CF, but for some reason rodgers has abandoned the idea and shoved him somewhere else. he'd actually get us some goals and open the play by just running him off the shoulder of Cbs, but rodgers would rather throw out 300 pound lambert.


okay, the contract situation has obviously impacted him on the pitch recently. most notably his touch. i dont think all the negativity and probably all the racist abuse he is getting is an aid to him.

we always relied on him to carry us this season and basically played him into the ground. in fact, we overplayed him so much we had to give him a break in the middle of the season.

one of the biggest problems is that him and most of the team arent enjoying their football anymore. do yourself a favour and go watch some videos of him in the academy and the last season. whole team has been shit recently, not just sterling.

null,false,ShockinglySynonymous,lfc68,,null,"Interesting post. I agree with you on some points and disagree on others. 

I agree with your view that Henderson is good but not great. However I feel like you are overlooking a range of factors which need to be considered. For example, Henderson is still quite young and is rapidly improving. This season has been a particularly good season for him, so it is important to note that he is getting better. I think that he has the ability to be a great player, he is incredibly technically gifted which is often overlooked by his hard workrate. I remember watching a video on the LFC youtube channel with Henderson, Suarez and Coates (i think) doing different challenges, and Henderson's technique when striking the ball was amazing. 

You also say that he works best as a box to box in a 4-4-2. I don't think this is accurate. He works well as one of two DM's in a pivot, as his workrate can allow for him to be used with a more creative midfielder. 

My last point is a general one about expectations of the types of players we can attract to the club. You say he is not a CL quality player, but when was the last time we bought a proven CL quality player to Anfield? Our best recent signings (Sturridge and Coutinho) have been young players at big clubs with lots of talent, but had fallen out of favour/ wasn't getting regular playing time. These are the types of players we can attract. We aren't going to be able to attract the hot young superstars such as Depay and Dybala because there are a host of more attractive clubs willing to pay more for them. As a result we need to look a bit further afield and try and get young diamonds in the rough. 

I think Henderson has the potential to be a great player for us if he keeps on improving. Obviously we would love players such as Pjanic or Hamsik, but I don't think that's realistic.

But if Martinez isn't for a new keeper, what can we do but hope he finds form next season, and that if he doesn't, Joel will step up like he did when he had a run of games. Verdict - Stay.

Hibbo - This is a no brainer - he stays until he scores an absolute belter. Verdict - Stay.

Distin - See ya, but I loved the best French international to never have been capped! New youth blooded into the squad in place of the Milkman would be better at this stage. Sad to see him go but... Verdict - Leave

Oviedo - With Garbutt potentiallly leaving, I'd love him to stay. I think his cover at LM is also a key quality to factor when thinking of why Bryan should stay a Toffee. I think he'll come good. Verdict - Stay (please!)

Gibbo- He's been so great when healthy...the if is too huge and the pay off isn't so great with players like McCarthy, Besic and potential youth waiting in the wings. Free up some wages if anyone would buy him...but I'd be sad for Gibbo to bounce. Verdict - Leave.

McGeady- I too want Aiden to prove his worth and make the extraordinary (like that goal vs Leicester) to be a more regular thing with more play time. I think we'll need him with Pienaar, Lennon and Atsu potentially shipping off - and for the price, who else could we afford? Realistically - Verdict - Stay.

Barry- He's still more than capable on his day, and it'd be a mistake to let GazBaz leave. Verdict - Stay.

Barkley- He's Everton through and through, and I don't want one bad season to discourage us from believing in the lad. No brainer - Stay.

Pienaar- I love you Peanuts, but your mystery injuries and lengthy spells on the physio's table mean you're occupying wages and roster space, so I think it's time for you to go. Verdict - Leave. :(

Naismith- The work rate and determination to pester the opposition, plus a knack for being in the right place to slot away goals makes him an essential squad player. You'd all miss him if he left. Verdict - stay.

Kone- I wish him all the best, and while he's not had the healthy season/preseason to get firing on all cylinders, I can't see us seriously contending for a top 4 spot with Kone as our alternative to Lukaku. I'd rather Austin, Ings, even Borini. Sorry Kone, but Verdict - Leave.

Lennon- If Levy doesn't fuck us, then I'd love to have Lennon permanently. He's been a positive contribution since coming over. Verdict - Stay.

Joel- Stay lad and fight for the #1 spot. I wouldn't mind if he usurped Howard. Verdict - Stay and play.

Baines - Can't even imagine him leaving. He'd be a hard void to fill, and offers so much attack prowess on that left flank. Stay forever!

Jags - Our captain deserves to stay as long as he likes. I've thought he's been fantastic this season, and has contributed to the goals as well. Essential to keep him fit and in the starting XI

Stones - The future of the spine of our club. If he leaves it'd be very hard to replace him. Stay

You take a look at any of the best squads to have graced the PL and the world in recent years and you'll find that they had a bedrock of hard working, talented but not world class players who kept the shit together when their more flukey talents (like...Sterling, Coutinho, Ibe, Sturridge, etc) aren't performing. 

Jordan Henderson has been our most consistent player. He's been, for most of the season, forced to play as a protective CM. When he's allowed to get forward he's as dangerous as Coutinho or Lallana. Just look at his work today. 

Jordan Henderson is exactly the type of player who should be a captain. He is a driving force. He is consistent. If every player we had was like Jordan Henderson we'd be in fourth this year because we'd have guys who could get through poorer patches through pure work ethic. 

I one hundred percent reject the notion that Jordan Henderson doesn't deserve to be playing at the pinnacle of the sport. He may never be in Ballon d'Or contention but not every member of our first 11 players need to be.

He is one of the most efficient, talented CMs in the Prem like now. He has been our best passer this season by far. He's also managed to score a number of goals.

I'm so tired of this sort of shit. You really don't know anything about sport or the history of winning clubs if you think a player like Henderson isn't a 100% necessity for us.
