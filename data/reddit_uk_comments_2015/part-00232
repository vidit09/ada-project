Yeah I've been around for a while. Whilst there were a few that were saying we'd be ok without Suarez, I think they were just trying to cushion the blow, or masking it, I dunno. But whatever, we are a much, much poorer team without him. I think any team would be to be honest except the two Spanish teams perhaps.

White people also suffered but less so. 

Let's take the model minority. You are aware British Indians produce a lot of the UK's doctors right? Were you aware that British Indians are 3 times more likely to be reported for bad communication despite speaking in the same accents as white people? In one case Indians from Newcastle who spoke with a Geordie accent were told to ""tone down the foreign accent"". 

You are three times more likely to suffer a case of bullying if you are British Indian if you work for the NHS than if you are white. 

And this is the MODEL minority. The group everyone goes to, to point out how much Muslims suck at it. 

If it's this bad for the Model student then imagine how bad it is for the guys people have a bunch of stereotypes about? 

The fact was that a lot of Muslims were horrified about this, yet we ignore those voices. 

It's like that Anjem Choudhary nonsense. He's an Idiot. But putting him on a newspaper sells newspapers. It's more profitable to ignore the voices of common sense. 

It's like whenever they showed Iraq, they always showed the guy burning an America Flag screaming in dumbass Arabic. 

Not this amazing bloke (http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/976x549/p02q74x0.jpg) 

We can do more to stop this if we actually tried to build ties rather than simply assume everyone is complicit. Like seriously? People tell me all Asians knew about this when I had to point out that I never received the memo... 

It isn't a conspiracy of silence. It's the fact that for ages little was done by the police to respond to the complaints of Asians. 

An example? 

My aunt and my cousin were tortured openly by her husband. For 15 years. We asked repeatedly to intervene. 

In the end it took 15 years of asking for the UK's police to step in. And they only did so after my mother agreed to explain the thing. Why? There were so few Hindus in the Police service (since Hindus tend to be much richer and prefer Middle and Upper Middle Class careers and policing is just too much effort...) that they were unwilling to intervene because they simply didn't understand what was going on. 

When they did respond they threatened to take away the kids from both of them. Not to actually arrest the abuser. My parents took care of my cousins until it was sorted out. 

People have spoken up mate, it's just that during the 90s and 80's there was a lot of bullshit like this that made Asians a bit wary about going to the police mainly because no one would ever listen. 

And yes the problem here with pointing our ""racism"" is that people simply don't think it exists or have a very distinct idea of racism and anything not that is not racist. 

I literally think cops who had problems with racism suddenly had consequences for their racism and so didn't do their job because they feared being racist when they should have done their job.

If someone grows up completely apathetic to politics then they are more likely to remain apathetic in adulthood than someone who has ""switched on"" earlier. If lowering the voting age persuades more young people to take an interest in politics and that has a trickle down effect as they grow up, that can only be a good thing.

You say ""I have yet to see among my age group anyone whose political view varied in a meaningful way from those of their parents"". That's probably true, I live in a middle-class artsy suburb and Labour and the Greens got practically all the votes in our internal elections. But what makes you think this is suddenly going to change when they're a couple of years older? Of course your upbringing has a huge impact on your beliefs, that's not exactly breaking news. Of course somebody whose parents are teachers are more likely to vote Labour than somebody whose parents work in the City - but that's just how humans work, I don't see how stopping young people from voting is going to change that. My views aren't magically going to transform when I finish full-time education, the effect of my upbringing isn't going to vanish overnight when I turn 18. 

It's also not as if the existing electorate is super-informed about these issues either. Let's not pretend that everyone voting on this issue over the age of 18 is going to be fully informed about the advantages and disadvantages of the European Union and isn't going to be at all swayed by the propaganda coming from both sides. Let's not forget that voting is optional and the 16 year olds that actually bother to turn up at the polling booth are going to be more likely to be informed about the issue than the average 16 year old.",null,0,null,1434665962,null,0,1434666244,0,csb8ct0,null,t3_3aau1p,null,t1_csb8ct0,null,t1_csb4m9s,null,null,null,1437177609,null,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

I got a 2:1 in Aerospace Engineering MEng from Manchester University in 2008 and was recruited into an engineering contractor company. I ended up being contracted to work on projects for my current employer and saw a golden opportunity to join a bigger company with more career opportunities.

I joined the company in 2010 on the graduate scheme, which is an 18 month structured programme where graduate trainees work in various areas of the company for 3 months at a time. It gives them an opportunity to try out the different types of roles and find something that they want to develop into a career. It's a really good programme and we obviously receive a lot of applications each year. We accept graduates with all sorts of degrees, not just engineering.

I'm not going to stick my head in the sand and claim that if the government were to lower the voting age to 16 years old, a sizable amount of the 16-17 age bracket wouldn't begin to become politically involved. What I am saying, is that we don't have the maturity necessary to merit a say in our governance. For all intents and purposes, the age of adulthood is 18 years old, anyone younger than that is legally a child. I believe there is a reason for that, that the limit was not placed arbitrarily. and that as such, by our lack of the independence and fully mentally developed state that adulthood brings, we shouldn't have the vote.

Essentially, I believe that it isn't because we want something that it should be given to us. Most teenagers want a myriad of things,  including the right to not have to go to school, the right to drink, smoke weed, smoke cigarettes, drive - but, fortunately, we're not allowed to because at the end of the day, we remain children. When we become adults, and society allows us to collect the privileges and responsibilities of adulthood, then, and only then, will we collect our polling rights.

This remains my opinion, I'm not seeking to convert anyone. If a majority of adults were comfortable with us getting the vote, than I wouldn't oppose myself to it (if it happened while I was still a teenager).

I like him as a player.  Jury is still out on why his form dipped in the final 12-18 months at Villa Park.  I don't think it's down to a lack of ability, but some think he is yet another example of a footballer who was playing for a contract and put his feet up as soon as he got it. Personally I choose to believe he is simply bereaved of confidence. He was being played out of position in a team who were, quite frankly, shit and then being slaughtered by fans who were annoyed that he wasn't scoring many goals.  

Derby are going to win more games than Villa next season, they will also create more chances than we ever did. If Andi actually gets used as a striker and hits the ground running then it wouldn't surprise me if he scored 20+ goals in the Championship.

but knoplyanaka or yarmo would help us immensely right now, and would help to develop players in the future. 

for me again agents are blood hungry, and good on them because that's their business, but at some point the business needs to be put in a better light, bc right now they loook like arseholes. 

lastly for me, if i had to go through and put togther a depth chart with signings, outbounds and potential signings, my depth chart would look like this. 

#1. gks - migs, bogdan, vigoroux (ward should go out on loan) 
#2. lbs - moreno, digne (been thrown around)/flanno
#3. cbs - skrtel, lovren, sahko, toure, ilori, gomez (should go out on loan), lloyd jones (should go out on loan) 
#4. rbs - wisdom, manquillo, clyne, flanno 
#5 midfielders- hendo, milner, can, allen, lucas, lallana, coutinho, kovacic, teixiera, rossiter (loan?), brannagan (loan?), chiravella (loan?), ibe, marko, jordan williams (loan?), ojo (loan?), kent (loan?) 
#6 strikers - origi, studge, ings, benteke (only guy we've really been linked with) and sinclair. 

we would need to trim the fat some, vigoroux would be a reserve, allen/lucas are likely to leave if we sign kovacic, but this represents a deep squad to me with a lot of talent.

I was in the same boat as you last year: it's hard to leave a steady job but looking back now I would say experience and contacts are the number one thing to be wary of before doing so. I couldn't have maintained myself if I didn't know people in other places who'd vouch for my skills to their employers so I could be brought onto new projects, but in the first month of freelancing I was back in the place I worked at all month on a day-rate (since there was no-one else there who did my job that could take over the workload)  and I'd not turned down any other work so I did eveningsat home as well for various other companies, so at the end of the month I'd earned about four times my monthly earnings from full time.

null,false,joltuk,null,null,null,"I find articles like this pretty disgusting actually. Some journalists have taken a tragic tale of a young person dying of something very rare, and then manipulated it to channel blame onto the people who treated her in order to make a good story. It feeds in to the nice trend in the internet using public now where people have unrealistic expectations of their doctors and no respect for their training or experience.

I just want to address two things:

First, if you turn up at your doctors with a headache that is 99.99% of the time a simple headache and 0.01% of the time a rare life-threatening brain tumour, they'll almost certainly treat you for the common headache and reassure you. In an ideal world you might want to give all of these people a brain scan, but if that scan is costing say, £100 (it's probably more), then it's costing you a million quid to catch each and every one of these. The NHS simply can't afford that. That's before you start looking at how harmful it is to test people unnecessarily, which wouldn't be ethical.

Secondly, it's really fucking cringey that the ""I caught my GP googling"" thing still comes up in these threads. People really should know better. Of course they use Google, it's basically the front page of the internet. If your doctor *isn't* using the internet to check his information is correct and up to date then they should be struck off. The skill comes in knowing what to search for and how to interpret the information they receive.

The British public have a really messed up perspective on healthcare where they've got ridiculously unrealistic expectations that they expect to have unlimited access to because they pay taxes (or not).

1. An adult can go wherever he wants, whenever he wants, within the confines of the law. An adolescent does not share that privilege. Why? Because that is considered unsafe, we are to young to make critical life decisions. We are not fully psychologically developed. If I can't go out on a Tuesday night, if that is my parents' decision, in what way am I meriting of the right to vote. I obviously don't have the maturity necessary for the same freedom of movement as an adult, and as such, I shouldn't share all of his rights. That's just my belief.

2. Maybe so. But I would argue that adults not being interested in the affairs of their governance is pure laziness, and not a lack of maturity. To me they are two separate issues. Adults have the right to not care, but they are independent, can marry, have jobs, live alone legally, pay taxes on their living income. Many adults may not give a darn about their right to vote, but they have the prerequisites for making an informed decision, and if they so desire, an uninformed one. Teenagers don't, for good reason, and unless, we, as a society, collectively decide that teenagers could handle all of those other rights and responsibilities, than we should not have the right to vote

I think there are some major strides to be done in terms of reducing adolescent illiteracy regarding the way we are governed, and politics as a whole.

There is a startling lack of awareness among my age group about all of this- I know these people, they are not incapable of understanding, just unmotivated and uninterested. 

I think this could be complimented by making available to students a shortened version of each bill ( about 10-15 pages as a general recommendation) with a page explaining why it should be made into law (presented by the government) and a page explaining why it shouldn't be (presented jointly by the opposition). I feel that if this was made a constituent part of this new ""civic education"" class, it would definitely lead to a generation of more politically aware, democratically involved citizens, and that can only stand to improve our society.

If you want to get into any VIP based job, first thing to remember is that most of the people you will deal with aren't really celebrities, its companies providing incentives for their employees/potential clients. Reading gossip magazines is useful to keep track of who the new 'celebrities' are since they change a lot. People can be rude, but most are normal people and don't cause problems. If they cause problems, don't let it slide just because of who they are.

**My qualifications:**

* 2:1 Masters in Chemistry (combined 5 year MChem course) from Edinburgh uni, with a year abroad in Singapore
* 4 A-levels, all @ A-grade: Chemistry, Maths, Philosophy, General Studies (lel)
* 11 GCSES: 4 A*, 7 A

I've had a couple of jobs before but nothing serious or long-term - mainly bar work and stuff at the Edinburgh fringe festival. I just signed on for the dole while I'm figuring out wtf to do.

My main issue is that I have absolutely NO idea - I'm fairly certain I don't want to go into the chemical industry (AstraZeneca, GSK etc) because I don't think I'd enjoy it. I've been looking at PhDs as well - some I think would interest me a bit, but I know if I'm gonna be pouring the next 3.5 years of my life into something, I'd better make sure I fucking enjoy it!

I can't really find anything I'm passionate about - my uni friends are learning programming together and starting to make a game, but I can't find the drive to start. I just want a good career that I'll enjoy doing, that doesn't require me to do 50+ hour work weeks. That's one of the main things I'm worried about - becoming too comfortable (due to pay, benefits, prestige etc) in a job I don't enjoy which ends up consuming most of my life. 

I've applied for a graduate scheme at the Royal Society of Chemistry in Cambridge, which would include publishing (something I think I would be awesome at), marketing and other things I'm not too sure about. Other than that I'm a bit late, because most of the jobs advertised to graduating students have already been taken by people who made their mind up earlier. 

I apologise for my vagueness but I'm happy to give more details about myself etc if someone feels like they want to give me some advice. Cheers!

Here's your problem. Our economy is ENTIRELY DEBT BASED. (Just in case your not aware, 97% of money in the UK economy is created by private banks as debt. The BoE has published this. Our economy is debt based and requires private debt to expand otherwise we enter a tailspin. Housing and stock markets are where most credit goes, hence a detachment from the real world). From 1971 onward, the point we moved to a pure fiat currency, the nation’s fiscal condition began to deteriorate with a negative inflection in 2000 and an even more severe downturn in 2008, which is the year that really represents the economic event horizon. That was the year the legs simply gave out and there is no coming back from that event. Not under the same 

The monetary system enacted in 1913 (and all fiat monetary systems), issuing currency backed by interest bearing indenture, was fatally flawed due to **a requirement for its very survival to create an ever-increasing stock of money**, without also providing the means for perfect investment, **resulting in a system where debt ultimately consumes all profits and labour over time**.

The whole system IS DEBT. Therefore unless you destroy the system and Cammy would get JFK'd for it (WWII was to maintain this debt based system). You can't fix a debt problem with more debt.

Those proles were led from the front by junior officers who had also gone to Eton, officers who were those ""toffs"" sons. The mortality rate for junior officers was significantly higher than for enlisted men, it would be when you're the one carrying the revolver and always the first over the top.

&gt; Although the great majority of casualties in WW1 were from the working class, the social and political elite were hit disproportionately hard by WW1. Their sons provided the junior officers whose job it was to lead the way over the top and expose themselves to the greatest danger as an example to their men.
&gt; Some 12% of the British army's ordinary soldiers were killed during the war, compared with 17% of its officers. Eton alone lost more than 1,000 former pupils - 20% of those who served. UK wartime Prime Minister Herbert Asquith lost a son, while future Prime Minister Andrew Bonar Law lost two. Anthony Eden lost two brothers, another brother of his was terribly wounded, and an uncle was captured.

Hence they're not investors. They're buying a reward and maybe making a donation if the reward is intangible. If what they are buying is worth it to them, then there's no reason why this should be a problem.

&gt; Having to convince a lender that you have a market is not a negative. The lenders confidence is a validity check that you have a sustainable long term business.

Lenders can't be expected to understand your market, and these days are generally uninterested in it. Approach them with something new or unusual and the answer will usually be 'no'. This acts as an unnecessary drag on enterprise.

The issue about risk is a good one but the pledgers are not investing, they are buying rewards. Their risk might be higher than most other forms of online shopping but they have just as many rights.

* Graduated with a 2:2 in Classical History in 2010 from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. Not my best idea as I really regret doing this degree, because your only real option directly linked to this subject is teaching/academia or museum-type work. 


* Got 5 A Levels (not sure if General Studies counts!). In retrospect this was a bad idea, as my workload was enormous and I really gave little to no thought about my exam choices or my plans for when I left. 

Quick job timeline: 

**October 2011-January 2012**: I got a temp contract, dealing with general customer service enquiries in a call centre. My main role was dealing with direct debits and billing, including promoting direct debit payments to existing customers. This was a lretty stressful role for me at least, if anything because it was very target-driven and there were targets for everything from the time spent in the queue to how quickly you moved between calls. 

**April 2013** I gained a job in my current workplace, working retail for a homewares store. I initially started out in the back office, primarily dealing in reports and auditing, as well as cash management (checking the safe, preparing bundles of notes for banking, getting tills counted and prepped for the next day and so on). I also at this time did some work managing the front end, such as assisting cashiers in processing transactions, giving authorizations to our sole under 18 cashier for age-restricted items and so on. 

**July 2014-current** I moved to customer services permanently at this point, primarily due to a store reshuffle as well as the resignations of several staff members, leaving the tills tight on cashiers. Initially I only processed payments, and then my supervisor introduced me to the full CSD, including giving me refund authorisations. This allowed me to then become a permanent customer service desk advisor. 

Really the key thing to my job isn't exams or anything, but a good friendly manner, good knowledge of the store and its products. The CSD is harder than the general till role because you're the one who gets the enquiries, the telephone calls, the angry ranting customers (please see /r/talesfromretail for examples), the managers pressuring you because effectively you're the one in charge there.

Two years later and a shedload of doctors visits later and eventually after I made it very clear that I wasn't just going to be sent on my way, in part helped by the fact that I'd done a LOT of reading into my symptoms and was therefore able to give specific, evidenced reasons as to why I queried the original diagnosis, did I get sent to a specialist and I was finally correctly diagnosed as having PCOS, a common condition which CAUSES hormonal issues.

Very well paid for what I do. I got lucky applying for the role on a whim and them wanting someone who was inexperienced to mold. Kinda thought the whole thing was a scam as the advert (which had dumbed down duties) did not match the salary.

Regardless of that however, the deposit is and always is your property held in trust by a government agency.  I have a similar problem I have to address when I move back to the UK.  I was in a rush to leave and had no time to argue with the greedy Jewish landlord over scuff marks on the wall (nothing else wrong with the place) only to find out he didn't keep the $650 deposit in a government protection scheme.  It has been years since I lived there now and when I get back, I will be making a claim against him for the amount + any other costs incurred which I can recall and document from that time + interest I would have accrued had that money been in my savings account instead of his.  

Landlords in the UK are predatory creatures and you should always have things in writing.  If they don't want to give you something in writing which says it is written with reference to the Landlords and Tenants Act, they are trying to rip you off.

(1) Jorge has a wide breadth of talent/number of players on his roster.

(2) Agents have a ridiculous level of influence on transfer dealings.

(3) Cost-wise, the deal is not really that much of a hindrance on Chelsea (especially in today's market, 7 mil + wages for a year or two is nothing). However for Falcao, this deal is pretty damn important (another shot in a big club, stable income etc). 

So it seems, this deal could be interpreted as Chelsea taking a little sacrifice, in order to do Falcao (and thus Mendes) a BIG favour. A favour that can be expected to be returned by Mendes in the future (him sweet-talking one of his upcoming world talents to choose Chelsea over another big club).

Then seen his shirt burned, realised what Liverpool meant to him and withdrew them and signed new contracts rewarding his 'loyalty'. No doubt that overall he was loyal, but he said at the time that he 'wanted to win the premier league' and didn't think Liverpool could do that - turns out he was right. He also said something like he doesn't want to be saying at 32 that 'next year will be our year' and that it would be a 'miracle' for him to win a title. - he was nearly wrong.

Despite these transfer requests, Gerrard turned it around with the supporters and an LFC hero. The only people that remember it is MUFC fans who have a song about it.

Saying that, Gerrard was welcomed back into the arms of the supporters much easier and more willingly due to him being from Liverpool, than Sterling would be.

All I'm saying is, if Sterling did hand in a transfer request, but still ended up staying, he could salvage his relationship with the fans, with the correct media responses (unfortunately he doesn't have that agent) and with on field performances.

You're saying the NHS is underfunded, so lets fund it more. We can increase taxes or reallocate taxes (from where is another huge debate) to meet this. We could perhaps tie funding to projected usage based on five year averages?

Adding any sort of fee that can significantly help funding is going to be too much for some people and discourage the poorest out there to go to the doctors when they need to.

Now, I agree with that.

&gt;You're saying the NHS is underfunded, so lets fund it more. We can increase taxes or reallocate taxes (from where is another huge debate) to meet this. We could perhaps tie funding to projected usage based on five year averages?
Adding any sort of fee that can significantly help funding is going to be too much for some people and discourage the poorest out there to go to the doctors when they need to. It won't make a difference to some people, so why not just whack it into a slight tax increase for those above a certain income?

Increasing tax is fine to an extent, but I fear that it would just be papering in the cracks with the way the NHS is funded at the moment. 

&gt;I know people living pay-check to pay-check and an extra £40 in one month is a big bloody deal to them. It's exactly those type of people I am concerned for.

Assuming the HOK and Deloitte have a similar gross-profit-to-revenue ratio, that means that 5% of the 5 billion they'll collectively receive won't be seen again in the UK. 

Companies generally spend [*15-30%*](http://www.ucsdhcjobs.org/wages-salaries.php) of their revenue on salaries. This doesn't include subcontracted labour. Using AECOM as an example again, they claim to employ [*Nearly 100000 worldwide*](http://www.aecom.com/News/Fact+Sheet) but only [*5000 in Europe, split across 80 offices*](http://www.aecom.com/Where+We+Are/Europe). A generous guess would be that AECOM employs 1000 people from the UK, 1% of their global workforce. Again, extrapolating to the other two companies, we can say that around 22% of 5bn will go to paying the salaries of employees outside the UK.

He even managed to turn Ozil into shite. While Mourinho improved Fabregas and played him in a position voyeur said he couldn't play in.

Why not? I'd agree people need to be close to the speed they quote when they know where you live, but is there any real point in changing the overall advert? The limitations are largely problems that no provider can overcome.

Shouldn't the focus be on differences *between* providers? 

&gt; Yeah, 1% &gt;_&lt;

For FTTC? I'm not surprised at all. The dropoff curve is *steep*.

So what's the alternative? If they swap the offer from ""up to 76M"" to ""up to 30M"" so that it covers the 10% (picking arbitrary numbers here), do you expect they'll still provide a 76M link to me right next to the cabinet, or cap everyone at 30?

How do you drive your car? Are you an aggressive driver? Do you speed often? Enjoy pushing it a bit?

The reason for the questions is simple enough. The primary difference between a 125 and a big bike is margin of error.

The extra power of a 600 means that things develop very much, much more quickly. Little mistakes are amplified.

If you think you are the kind of person who would ride aggressively / quickly then learn on a 125.

I learned on a 125 (for different reasons) and find big bikes much easier to ride, but if I had started on a 600 I can think of several specific instances where I would have crashed, no doubt.

Its a bit different for me though as I learned to drive a motorcycle before a car, so everything was new.

If you are sensible and can trust yourself not to take risks, the DAS would be the best way to go in my opinion. Saves the hassle of buying and selling a 125 and you will have a more capable motorcycle.

If you know that you are a risk taker then I'd say 125. You will still have fun, but this way you can make your mistakes with a bigger safety margin.

Good Luck :)

Perhaps it wasn't a coup at all. Perhaps the whole ""I will resign"" thing was just a publicity stunt. Never mind getting nearly 4M votes (which is what? 1/4 of the population of London?), Niggle reckoned that having the party ""begging"" him to come back was a guaranteed popularity boost, given the flagging support over the last few months.

However many senior figures in the party disagree or are not told, hence the upset in the few days after the election. Smiling Pint Man becomes not so smiley and decides to throw his weight around, resulting in the sacking of a few bods. Evans herself may not like the fact that these guys are sacked and that Carswell is somehow pushed to the side. So in an interview she admits that the power hungry Farage can be a bit controversial.

Of course, this position angers the already highly strung Farage (Highly strung? Yes, he should be....) and he sacks her. It's a sign of such excellent taste and diplomacy that she hears about it from the BBC and not from Niggle himself (which IMHO is pretty fucking cowardly - if you're going to give someone bad news then at least do it yourself) and actually supports the statements made by O'Flynn a few weeks ago.

I don't think Evans, ""Tower of strength"" that she is was actually pushing for the leadership, but it is of course entirely possible that someone who was essentially offered a job in May only to be told ""actually we've changed our minds, the current encumbent has been asked to stay on"" might be a tad disappointed. And besides, it's not like she's said anything we don't already know: Niggle Farrige is actually quite a divisive figure. Even Marmite don't want to know, f'r crying out loud.

To me this just shows that Farage now believes the hype, has become rather paranoid and is barely suitable to lead a minority party, let alone front a hugely important campaign that could well decide the success or failure of the UK over the coming years.",null,0,null,1434696587,null,0,false,0,csbms79,null,t3_3abm7h,null,t1_csbms79,null,t1_csb9h26,null,null,null,1437186753,null,8,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,8,null

My issue is that my GPA is somewhat difficult to calculate because I did a study away program at another Canadian university for one semester during the summer but that is not calculated into my university's GPA.

Essentially, I have just under a 2:1 with just my main university's transcript alone (that takes into account all four years). However, I did very well during my semester away so when those grades are calculated into my overall GPA I most likely have a 2:1. If a grad school only looks at my last 2 years of school, or weighs those last two years more heavily than the first two, I definitely have a 2:1. It's all very confusing. I guess I won't know how it all works until I apply. Any input you have would be great, however. 

Since you're in the final months of the ID MSc, can I ask you how it is? Does the program focus more on developmental theory or is there a fair amount of practical NGO managerial application taught as well?

Remember it's never going to be cheap since a place like that needs to be hardened against terrorist attack, with subterranean bunkers, communications centers etc. And ultimately we'd just end up with another generic shinny-silver looking boring chamber like the EU, Holyrood, Bundestag etc. 

My opinion is the Palace of Westminster is both historically important enough to splash the cash on, and the established seat of government. It should continue to function in that capacity, regardless of the cost. There is a great deal of ignorance and misunderstanding going on in this thread. For example people are calling for the government to move facilities off site. Except they already did... in 1975 to the Norman Shaw Buildings and again in 2000 to Portcullis House.

It would be a terrible crime to let a place like that fall into ruin or be demolished simply because its become a symbol of some perceived petty injustice in the last few years. This was the place that Catholic conspirators tried to bring down the government to effect a revolution. It's also the place that Winston Churchill told the commons that *We Shall Fight Them On the Beaches*. You lot should try to see past some of your petty grievances against London and a modern political elite and see what the building represents. 

**Tl;dr** The Palace of Westminster is a Grade 1 listed building that is the seat of government. Repair is inevitably going to be expensive because a) the palace is old b) Previous works extensively used asbestos c) because it needs hardened facilities to withstand everything from an opportunistic IRA mortar bomb to a nation-state cyber-attack.

I spent a lot of time trying to find a pair of headphones that weren't too bulky and didn't cost a months rent and ended up with a pair of Sennheiser Momentum 1.0 on ears for £100. They are a little bit bass heavy for my liking, but handle the dynamics very well (Chopin Ballade No.1 and the 1812 have both been good test pieces for me). For home use I have a pair of Beyerdynamic DT990's which are now quite old, but still sound fantastic. Being that they are an open design I can't use them out and about or in the office.

My impression of active noise cancelling is that you are asking the drivers to do more - they have to reproduce the music, and also produce an inverse of whatever noise is around you. This means a lot more work, and less dynamic range available for your music. Now I'm not an audio engineer, so I could well be wrong, this is just observation and guesswork.

Another part of the problem is the nature of how most people listen to music today. The formats that are used just don't have the dynamic range that's needed for classical music, especially an extremely dynamic piece (The Planets springs to mind here).",null,0,null,1434700322,null,0,false,0,csbns4m,null,t3_3aad3l,null,t1_csbns4m,null,t1_csbc20v,null,null,null,1437187233,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

I went to Uni to study journalism, graduated with a 2:1 and pretty much fell into SEO as my first 'proper' job eight years ago. I had no idea at the time how big the digital marketing industry was and it's grown massively since. In the eight years I have been here, we've gone from about 15 staff in a pokey office in Leeds, through to about 150 staff in three offices. 

I'd always had an interest in digital and the web, but never saw digital marketing as a career path when I was younger - I was more interested in just creating content. In truth, I've been quite lucky that 'content marketing' as a concept is really growing and it has allowed me to forge a good career. Trying to figure out what makes Google tick, and being at the sharp end of internet developments, can be really interesting - even if talking about it at dinner parties is a sure-fire way to clear a room.

In practice you hand over a chunk of your pay packet each week to an organisation that invests it, they might make profit they might loose it as well, they take a slice off the fund for managing it whether they make or loose, then they take a slice for any profit.  These guys are part of the 1%.

The ability to continue to make money by investing in the stock market is assured because of all the extra money being invested by others in the stock market.  It is a bit of an emperors new clothes, if we stopped pumping money into it, the market stops growing everyone would realise that the market wasn't worth as much as they thought and we get a crash. 

Assuming by the time you get to retirement this market has performed as projected (this is open to debate as past projection have not been met) then you can buy insurance against living with the big pile of cash to get a guaranteed income each year, however with advances in medicine, you are going to live a lot longer so you are not going to get the same sort of deal that someone would get today.

Life insurance is insurance against dying so should logically be called death insurance, an annuity is insurance against living and so should be called life insurance.  We spend the first part of our life insuring against dying and the second part insuring against living.

Worked in a ceramic tile warehouse, collecting orders.

Factory worker, making abrasives

Managed a adult shop

Mobile phone sales exec

Eismann, selling and delivering frozen foods at the door

Site manager-homeless hostel

Care worker (team leader) Childrens care home.

Care worker, different childrens home

Left to attend university (studied psychology and sociology)

Present time, unemployed. Hoping to start work as a trainee bus/coach driver soon...just waiting on the DVLA to get their act together.

FWIW this isn't just a UKIP issue, I think anyone who votes for single issue parties (Justice for Men and Boys was a good one in my area) is astoundingly myopic.  A single issue is never the root cause of anything, and parties shouldn't treat people like idiots in their campaigns and pretend they've got the magic bullet.  What would these single issue parties do if they actually got into power and had to run a country?  Look at the state of the UKIP ""leadership"" in the last few weeks; can you imagine that bunch of clowns making decisions that *actually matter*?

In the UK we banned farrowing crates pre 2001 where as in the EU they are still used. Farrowing crates dramatically decrease the cost of production and UK farmers are just unable to compete.

[Refugees make up 0.23% of the UK population](http://www.unhcr.org.uk/about-us/the-uk-and-asylum.html). I can see your points about them probably suffering from poor mental health but I can't see how that is a good enough reason not to offer support. Pakistan has 1.6 million refugees, I bet very few of them get any health care and mental health counselling. As far as integrating in to communities, I can also see how that would cause problems, but yet again somewhere like [Turkey would suffer from this more.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/20/amnesty-report-desperate-plight-syrian-refugees-turkey) I'm sure lots of them are depressed, but I bet a lot of them have reasons to pull themselves through and survive, people can go through terrible things and still be worthwhile contributors to society. I could give examples but it seems silly as it would just be individuals who I have heard of.

I would like to suggest that you draw a distinction between illegal immigrants and refugees, [they are not the same thing despite being closely linked and there are common misconceptions about this in the media frequently](http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2013/09/uk-media-needs-stop-referring-refugees-illegal-immigrants). 

If you use the estimate of [618,000 illegal immigrants](https://fullfact.org/immigration/how_man_illegal_immigrants_uk-32868) in the UK compared to the total population of 64.1 million that means they make up about [0.7-1.4% of the UK population](http://immigration.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=005235#UK). 

Having worked in bars in London I met people overstaying on student visas, working illegally when supposedly a student. The ONS estimates that [35% of non-EU students hold jobs in the UK illegally and research by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) indicates that 60% of illegal immigrants surveyed were people who had overstayed regular visas with half of them actually having higher education despite only 1/4 working in skilled labour] (http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/apr/20/more-action-illegal-immigration-ippr-report) which kind of disputes your point about it meaning a huge influx of unskilled labour. I would suggest this indicates that language and or the fact they can't find legal work pushes them in to unskilled labour rather than them wanting to do it. I guess some illegal immigrants cluster and don't integrate, but that probably reflects their clandestine nature, having to rely on connections and support networks so they don't get caught. The ones I personally knew were all just working in the service industry so they were very well integrated with the people they served.

Having said all of that, and it not being related to the video that started this thread, I can't quite accept that when thousands of people die on boats escaping terrible terrible things that we, as a nation, don't really care. We don't need to take all of them, I'm sure many of them aren't aiming for anywhere in particular except away from where they are. I remember reading this article a few weeks ago about [the survivors of the big boat sinking](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/22/migrant-boat-disaster-mediterranean-survivors-stories) and I can't find it now but there was another one that really pulled my heart strings about a commercial boat where the captain saw all these people in the sea and was told by his superiors to leave them drowning, he disobeyed his orders and saved them. I just can't even imagine seeing that, seeing men, women and children drowning and being told to leave them. It makes me want to cry!

null,false,jimmyloo78,null,null,null,"I understand that a large portion of adult Britons have little to no interest in the way they are governed. That a sizable proportion of those getting involved, do so on the basis of lies and deceptions. That many people will vote following only one ""critical"" issue without considering the ramifications of their vote, or the myriad of other policies that the new government would seek to implement. I may be young but I've seen enough of the world, enough of people, to realize that wisdom is not a side-effect of the aging process. Although, when I reread my post, I understand how you may have come to that conclusion. 

As I have stated in other posts, I don't believe that teenagers possess the mental faculties, as an age bracket (some individuals might, some might not), to merit the right to vote. Teenagers still live with their parents, a majority of them go to school everyday, they are not allowed to drink, or smoke, or drive. They aren't allowed to serve overseas, they don't hold full time jobs, or have children, or get married. We are a group of people who are still profoundly rooted in childhood, and as such, the law imposes a great number of reasonable constraints, to regulate and control our behaviour. We remain profoundly puerile, and that to me, is undeniable fact.

When I hear an argument similar to mine own, there are always people to mention the Scottish referendum. How teenagers became extremely politically involved, and proved their ability to shape policy through their collective will. I understand what people mean by that, but as I previously stated ""You don't give Mcdonalds to six year olds everyday, and you shouldn't give the vote to us."". I believe that as children, what we want isn't always what should be done, because we don't have the maturity to come to our own independent decisions. I firmly believe that the right to vote doesn't differ in any meaningful way from the other rights of adulthood, voting is nothing if not a complex issue, and that lowering it to please a younger demographic, is nothing if not populist nonsense.

I'm 21 now, and my year group were 15/16 at the last general election in 2010. I would only have been 15 on polling day, but I was still passionately in favour of 16 and 17 year olds having the right to vote. 

After the general election we watched powerlessly as cuts were made to higher education, tuition fees were tripled in response, and the education maintenance allowance was scrapped entirely rather than reformed. Michael Gove made sweeping changes to the school system and national curriculum that were opposed by teachers, head teachers, education specialists and university admission officials at almost every turn, including scrapping AS levels.

Politicians make decisions based on the demographics of people who vote. Older people get a lot of concessions and perks when policies are made because their turnout is much higher than other age groups, which makes their support instrumental in getting elected. By contrast, politicians make decisions about the lives of young people with impunity. You can't vote for their opponents, so why should they give a shit about you?

And believe me, there's no magic switch that turns you into a responsible, mature and politically aware adult on your 18th birthday. I went away to university as an 18 year old kid, surrounded by hundreds of other 18 year old kids. We were living without parents for the first time, but were we independent, fully mentally developed, mature and responsible citizens of society? Were we fuck! We were adolescents; young, excited by our sudden freedom, and often completely out of our depth.

Adulthood isn't simply ""aging up"" out of childhood by virtue of an older and more mature brain. It's a learning process that never really stops. 18 **IS** an arbitrary line in the sand, put there simply because society needs a cut-off point.

http://careers.stackoverflow.com/company/mediaburst?c=6IeSMWEsBkUAPzCo 

Right now, we're looking for a new Developer to join the team, preferably with a few years under their belt, knowledge of C#, JS and the .NET framework and someone who doesn't mind working in Manchester all week (bonus points for Linux or Perl knowledge and SMS industry experience but we're mainly after someone who can pick up our tech stack and help us write better apps).  We're pretty flexible on more or less everything and it's a proper laid back atmosphere.

From what I understand, grade wise, you should be all right. Many students from North America in Edi (and this course specifically), so that should be cool too.

With regards to the course, generally speaking, it is good. The department has some organizational issues but other than that, it is a very prestigious University and the professors are very experienced in terms of research and employment in the ID sector. 
The direction the course will take depends very much on the electives you choose. The two core courses are 'Politics and Theories of ID' and 'Interpreting Development: Institutions and Practises', so one is very theoretical and the other a bit more practical. After that it's up to you to focus on a region (Africa, South Asia, etc) and to an extent a discipline. ie more economic focus, political, or socio-anthropological. There is also an opportunity to take a work-based dissertation where you take up a 2 month placement in an NGO type organisation. I'm currently doing research in India for my placement which is quite cool.

I must warn you that there is quite a bit of theory involved in some modules, and overall there is a  somewhat critical (dare I say cynical) approach to ID from a lot of professors, so be prepared for that. My background is political science/ international relations, so I was exposed to that sort of narrative, but it comes as a surprise to some people.

My job is to work alongside our clients in building full global campaigns to promote their brand, we take their requests and then working with our creative teams build all parts of the campaign including packaging design. 

I spend most my time briefing creatives to create various touch points for the brand I work on, this includes both digital and physical marketing mediums then presenting such materials to my client for their approval. 

My team is the global central team so we have to work with all our end markets which includes around 70+ countries. This means if they have any materials that they wish to present to client they have to seek approval from our team first, this means we constantly have to analyse design layouts against our brand image and code to make sure were selling the right message.

It's a very enjoyable and challenging job, my days are never the same although I have projects spanning months they are always evolving and changing especially when we meet with the legal team to understand what we can and can't do in each market. 

I left University with 2:2 back in 2012 with a degree in Music Promotion, only a few parts of my degree are relevant in my job and the only requirement degree wise for this job was that I had one. I currently work in London but live outside and earn a very competitive salary.

Which given what UKIP stand for is a dangerous strategy; one could also claim that that's ignorant (ignorant of the potential consequences of having a paddy at the polling booth and voting for a party you don't believe in).  Also probably ignorant that in your ""rebellion"" you're actually just voting for another member of the London banking set in Farage. 

&gt;They may have even just thrown their vote away in the face of the broken voting system

There are better ways of doing that; leaving me to wonder if this isn't also an ignorant option.  If you want to throw your vote away, fine, don't potentially saddle the rest of us with having to deal with the craptastic party you chose to waste your vote on.

But anyway, I don't really believe that most of UKIPs votes came from rebel or protest voters, just like I don't think most of the Green's support comes from protest votes.  I think most people vote for the party they'd like to see in power. 

&gt; You can talk all you want about the party, and their personal failings, but that's not who was being besmirched; the ones who voted for them were. 

I mean, one kind of follows on from the other here.  If a party is full of ignorant, bullish, bigoted people, and I vote for them because I like them, what does that make me?  You could of course argue that about a lot of Westminster, but UKIP wear it like they're out and proud of it. 

I get that people don't like being called ignorant (directly or indirectly) I don't either; but things are often true whether we like them or not.  I think UKIP basically treated its potential voter base as if they were ignorant by campaigning the way they did on the single issue that they chose (admittedly the issue is basically their *raison d'etre* so it wasn't much of choice by the time the election came around).

  Reading is great for increasing vocabulary and understanding of the written word, painting, learning instruments and other arts are traditional means of creativity,  talent and culturally appreciated, they've been around for thousands of years. Gaming is new, especially these multiplayer over Internet ones. It separates people,  instead of kids playing together they sit in rooms on their own talking through a computer. Often shouting and swearing at people they don't even know,  taking rages where they get so angry they smash controllers or get up and start punching things, even themselves I've seen. And you compare this to traditional pass times and say it's a weird dichotomy? It's not weird. The contrast is obvious.



 So much of the youth don't appreciate anything not on a screen,  driving through beautiful scenery and can't draw their eyes from phone/tablet,  lush day at a fair budding artists playing guitar and keyboard and singing ""This is shit, I'm going back to go on PS4."" Visiting family for yearly get together,  kids barely look up to engage. Young lad I work would rather wait in line for a self service checkout than go and be served straight away by a cashier who's free. I'm having a bit of a rant here but seriously,  young people are losing traditional social decorum so quickly it worries me.

&gt;The prime minister will say there are Muslims who buy into aspects of the critique of the west but who don’t go so far as to advocate violence. By accepting some of these prejudices and telling fellow Muslims to accept aspects of this world view, the extremist Islamic narrative is given weight, he will say.

&gt;“This paves the way for young people to turn simmering prejudice into murderous intent. To go from listening to firebrand preachers online to boarding a plane to Istanbul and travelling onward to join the jihadis.”

&gt;As a result, Cameron intends to warn that “a troubled boy who is angry at the world or a girl looking for an identity, for something to believe in and there’s something that is quietly condoned online or perhaps even in parts of your local community then it’s less of a leap to go from a British teenager to an Isil [Isis] fighter or an Isil wife than it would be for someone who hasn’t been exposed to these things.”

I grew up at a time when being served cheap white sliced bread and margarine with every meal except Sunday roast was normal. We ate enormous amounts of shitty low quality carbs, and nutritional knowledge was limited to ""meat and two veg.""  

Maybe it's portion control - we ate bread to fill us up because it was cheap and food portion servings were small. Nowadays you just give the kid a second helping.  Is that worse than shitty processed bread?

I ended up dropping out of university in my second year because of some financial fuckupery. Managed to get a basic office admin job for a year almost immediately, because a friend I'd made in the D&amp;D club worked there and let me know there was a job opening coming up soon. When that ran out - because I'd been too efficient at reorganising the office filing system and effectively cut my own role out - I ended up drifting unemployed for a year.

Moved to London, got a shit office admin job for a year via job hunting websites, then found a better office admin job via a friend. Still in that job now, aged 27. None of these jobs related at all to my half-a-degree in Law with Human Rights. I do everything from printing &amp; binding documents, to website support and updates, to general tech support, to billing clients and keeping the company finances up to date, to drafting press releases and presentations, to booking venues and flights for international client meetings, to the morning coffee run. It's not high-flying glamour, but it pays the bills.

What's been important for me is having a life outside work. If you have a job you love, great. But not everyone will - I'd even say that most people won't. So find a job that doesn't make you miserable, and use the money from that to live a life you enjoy.

If the book had been sold for £5 (lower than the normal discount for new hardback books on Amazon to potentially account for the production costs, but fairly arbitrary) then they would need to sell 200,000 copies to make £1M. With ~11m Tory voters in the last election that would mean less than 2% of the Tory voters would need to buy the book, and that's ignoring the number of Thatcher-loving Republicans in the US who would be a good source of purchasers

Whilst a lot of books don't sell in large enough numbers to make a million, this one feels like it probably would have easily made that much. It's a bit of an old list, but if you look at the following article from 2012 it shows that 200,000 books would not even put it anywhere close to being in the top 100 UK sellers

Alternatively for a ""better"" source of figures, this link shows the Christmas week book selling figures from 2014, and if a Thatcher book couldn't outsell a book from Boris (Churchill Factor, Boris Johnson 32,625) then I would be a little surprised :)

&gt;Daily Rate Rental Credit

If we fail to repair or supply your service on time, you can claim Daily Rate Rental Credit which will be calculated as follows: Quarterly line rental x 4 divided by 365 = the daily rental.

The daily rental will be multiplied by the number of days we are late in installing or repairing your service. This also applies to chargeable calling features. These tables show you from which day the call allowance or Daily Rate Rental Credit will begin. 

If we fail to keep an appointment we have made with you, you can claim a one-off fixed rate payment of £10.

If we're unable to provide or restore service on your telephone line before the date that Daily Rate Rental Credit becomes payable (as stated in the table above), you may be able to claim actual financial loss for any additional period that you continue to be without service. You can claim up to a maximum of £1,000 per residential line. You can claim actual financial loss in addition to Daily Rate Rental Credit. All claims must be submitted in writing.

You must make your claim within four months of us putting things right. For actual financial loss, you must make your claim in writing. You can contact BT and request a claim form and if you're eligible to claim BT will arrange for a claim form to be sent to you.

Nonsense. You clearly have a very distorted view of what doctors do and they way they're trained. The vast majority of medical education is based on clinical experience and practical exams, and even the parts that do include large amounts of memorisation require a solid understanding to make sense if any of it. Medical schools and postgraduate training programmes put more weight into OSCE's (Google it) than written exams, meaning there tends to be more emphasis of history taking, examination skills, communication training, and practical procedures than traditional 'rote learning' as you think. Before you try criticising a whole profession, at least educate your ignorant self.

I also felt that at the hustings, she was saying things I hadn't heard before. Not necessarily on policy (it's pretty tough to start trying to set policy when you're not leader yet) but when she talked about having been on benefits herself and the frustration and anger of it, that was something I hadn't heard from a politician before.

The media is always ragging on about how expensive it is, which coincidentally allows more talk of privatisation. But if we adopted a more privatised system it would end up costing us more- which is seen in Germany where they have a part privatised model and spend more money per person on their healthcare. 

To illustrate, stats of what the **government spends** in each country on healthcare per capita: 

Germany - $3339

France- $3130

USA - $4437

UK- $2919 

Our system is really good, and a lot of countries attempt to emulate us. I'm a little dismayed by how the UK government and media generally treat the NHS as it is a really good deal for this country.

Disclaimer: This is my personal view:

First off, your point about privatisation. The NHS will not be privatised by any Government, there is no chance that will happen so don't fear an American-style system. The NHS budget for 2013/14 was around £112bn or so, and only 6.1% of that was spent on care provided by for-profit providers in the independent sector. Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) are the decision makers for how clinical services are commissioned locally (there are 211 of them, so they are fairly locally-focussed). If they genuinely believe that a private provider can offer a clinical service better than an NHS provider, for the same price then let them make that decision. But in all honesty, the privatisation rhetoric is just scaremongering (and that's my personal view - as someone who has always voted Labour). Private providers will never go anywhere near large acute contracts, A&amp;E services or emergency care, as there is nothing for them to gain there so it's all been blown out of proportion.

Re. the financial situation - it's true the finances are tough, but Simon Stevens the Chief Executive of NHS England is very experienced and his Five Year Forward View, does put forward a sustainable future for the NHS and thankfully it is largely supported across the political spectrum. 

Ultimately, it is going to be an interesting and probably tough few years for the NHS, but I have no doubt that it will remain - as it has always been since Nye Bevan introduced it in 1948 - free at the point of service, funded from general taxation and based on clinical need, not ability to pay.

TL;DR - the NHS will be fine. It will face a squeeze but this country needs it too much for anything else. Also privatisation rhetoric is scaremongering and not accurate.",null,0,null,1434708542,null,0,false,0,csbpp74,null,t3_3aarrh,null,t1_csbpp74,null,t1_csbp611,null,null,null,1437188235,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

A fair point. My response is they shouldn't apply to either as they're currently written, because they're written in a way that is open to manipulation and bias of prevailing popular opinions. Treatment of Muslims since 9/11 in the UK has been disgraceful, but that's a separate issue.

So they should like some sports star but not some guy who produces content they like and consume. I wouldn't know most sports people if I bumped right into them. 

Some people really like certain authors or artists and some people would have no idea who they are.

&gt; Gaming is new, especially these multiplayer over Internet ones. It separates people, instead of kids playing together they sit in rooms on their own talking through a computer. Often shouting and swearing at people they don't even know, taking rages where they get so angry they smash controllers or get up and start punching things, even themselves I've seen. And you compare this to traditional pass times and say it's a weird dichotomy? It's not weird. The contrast is obvious.

It depends on the game I suppose and the value judgements people make about hobbies and entertainment because they aren't used to things. There are some accepted pastimes that if you think about them critically are really quite odd.

There are studies showing that games build visual acuity, hand eye coordination, problem solving and strategic thinking. Regarding multiplayer games in particular provided it's not every man for himself they teach team working and leadership and management skills. Ignoring all of that though why does a hobby or entertainment need to be productive at all.

Young lad I work would rather wait in line for a self service checkout than go and be served straight away by a cashier who's free.

All of these examples are again based on value judgements as to what you think other people should find acceptable and enjoyable.

&gt; So much of the youth don't appreciate anything not on a screen, driving through beautiful scenery and can't draw their eyes from phone/tablet

Lots of people just don't like looking at a view, climbing a mountain or hiking somewhere just to experience a certain scene. Even if you like that sort of thing you can only stare at something for so long.

I can definitely see why that would be irritating to people who don't like that sort of thing.

If you treat ISIS like a massive deal you lend credence to their idea that they are fighting a war and they might win. 

Currently the only narratives we have are ""they're all evil and want to destroy the west"" and ""we will destroy the evil west"". I also think this is a nastier version of the same thing driving people to disengage with politics and the rise of more fringe groups elsewhere recently. Politicians need to realise that the way they currently do business helps the nut jobs and alienates the populous.

They paid 25p a mile so all that over a quid, I politely pointed out it was a 14 mile round journey instead of 10 and she shrilled like a banshee ""you trying to tell me how to do my job? I can stop your claim right now""

I sat there dumbstruck, and luckily another adviser came over and told her I was correct, and no apology or anything.

Oh and ""coincidentally"" there was like a hatchway where you went to when you claimed expenses, and this always had a sign on saying ""closed away for lunch"" and when I asked when it would open I was told 2pm

So I was waiting 45 minutes to claim all of £3.50 petrol money, 2pm came and went, 230pm came and went, and we had to leave at 245pm to get back to pick the exes daughter up from school and still no sign of the hatch being open

What aspect of work at (presumably) the Department of Education would involve the Official Secrets Act?

What do you think about this?
&gt;Though free schools were sold as the apotheosis of parental choice, only a few have been opened and run by community groups. Most of them are run instead by ‘approved sponsors’, a group of companies and chains that have been given permission to run free schools and academies. It is impossible to find out how the companies were selected and approved; it is also difficult to find out who is applying to be on the list. Laura McInerney, an education journalist and former teacher, submitted several freedom of information requests to the Department for Education, asking civil servants to release all the applications to form free schools they had received, along with the letters advising applicants of the DfE’s decisions. The DfE rejected her requests. McInerney complained to the Information Commissioner’s Office, which ruled in her favour. The DfE appealed to a First Tier Tribunal, describing her claim as ‘vexatious’ and arguing that the expense of meeting her request would be too high, and that disclosure would jeopardise commercial sensitivities. McInerney lost the appeal. ‘When it comes to schools the government need to remember they’re asking people to hand over their children for six hours each day and a chunk of their wages to pay for it,’ she told me. ‘Why should anyone do that and not at least expect to know who is using that money and time, and how they are using it?’

They're cramped together. Usually they get territorial and start fighting, pecking at each other and until recently many chickens died from these fights. Now farmers have found a solution: [they simply cut the beaks off young chicks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wy_i6NFG-Y). That way they *try* to peck each other but can't do any damage. But because of the selective breeding of chickens they grow to an incredible size at an unnatural rate. They often develop arthritis in their legs because they can't hold up the weight, and a common occurrence in these barns is that the chickens' legs simply buckle under their weight and they can no longer move. They eventually die of starvation.

Everything that Steve Kelley writes he prefaces with ""I"". Now is this really the appropriate response of a person writing on behalf of a company? No, any person responding on behalf of any organisation will use the form ""At FSG, we believe.."" ""FSG's policy regarding.. is.."". Maybe a higher up would provide response on a more personal level but for an Assistant to be claiming to speak for FSG is definitely a red flag.

  It does depend on the game, I quite like racing games for example but a lot I see them playing are simply trying to kill each other, these and movies etc are serving to desensitise the young generation to extreme violence. There are befits, those you have mentioned plus better reaction time and improved quick critical thinking but on the flip side there us also an association of reduced empathy like. This has nothing to do with the main discussion though, become a little sidetracked from the issue.




Yes, value judgements about being out and about,  being physically active. I'm not condemning gaming etc. My point is that it's replacing actually doing stuff. Even just being on ones's feet and walking round is a lot more beneficial to fitness than sat in a chair.

How many times in recent years have we seen World Class players leave because they are not in the starting XI? Quite a few. So although no-one knows how Mourinho labels his players, I would hope there is no pecking order, but as there obviously is, hopefully this means next season, bar Costa being 1st, 2nd/3rd doesn't exist, and they are merely back up strikers, unless Falcao manages to regain his form of old, in which case we have a delightful problem.",null,0,null,1434712578,null,0,false,0,csbqo7t,null,t3_3adzwn,null,t1_csbqo7t,null,t1_csbq9gw,null,null,null,1437188630,null,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2,null

Now I'm not 100% for that policy either but I absolutely do not think it's the end of the world, nor is it one of their priority areas.
2. Xenotransplantation - I don't really understand why you think this is such a huge issue. It doesn't even exist yet. Yes, I agree that it's potentially a bad idea to completely ban any research into it but to claim that ""lots of people would die from this one"" is just silly given that it hasn't actually been put into practice yet so it's not saving any lives and we don't even know if it's able to save lives. As I've said, I don't think that research into that should be banned but I do completely understand why the Green Party is uncomfortable about it and alternatives that do not involve animals (e.g. growing artificial human organs using stem cells which could overcome lots of the practical issues with xenotransplantation) should be encouraged. 
3. Anti-GMO: This is a really difficult area but I'm going to have to agree with the Green Party here. *In theory* I think genetic modification is a brilliant thing and has a huge potential for improving people's lives. The problem is that at the moment, they literally are just being used as a profit-making device for MNCs. Biotech firms have proven that they're unable to deal with GM crops properly and the patenting laws that exist at the moment are giving these companies a ridiculous amount of power. If we had regulators that actually had influence over the private sector and biotech industries that put the needs of people over profit then I would be an enthusiastic supporter of GM but at the moment, it's just a device for profit and exploitation. Rather than allowing these corporations to wield a ridiculous amount of power and leverage over poor farmers who are vulnerable because of environmental problems we caused, we should be helping them actually deal with these environmental problems rather than leaving them to the mercy of these firms.
4. Are you sure that's their policy? It doesn't say anything about academic journals, just journals. To me, this looks like a poorly worded policy in their manifesto rather than a genuine attempt to ""censor"" scientific journals.
5. Anybody who supports nuclear energy is not truly left-wing. Supporting nuclear energy is a good environmental policy, but the Green Party isn't a purely environmental party - it's a left-wing party. I 100% understand why you support nuclear energy and why a lot of young lefties support nuclear energy because I was also a passionate supporter until fairly recently. The problem with the debate around nuclear energy is that both sides always discuss defunct arguments and completely ignore the actual issues.

Environmentally, nuclear energy is pretty much as good as renewable energy. Both of them have issues, both of them are also much better than the other alternatives. It's *not* the environmental issues that are the problem. The real issue is that an awful lot of modern environmentalists seem to be getting tunnel vision and forgetting that they're environmentalists for humanitarian reasons, so social factors are as important as environmental factors. And socially, renewables have a major, major advantage over nuclear energy - decentralisation. Nuclear energy is an extremely convenient fuel source for large energy corporations because it's pretty much the most centralised energy source imaginable. It requires huge, expensive contracts that supply them with a steady stream of income over the course of decades and crucially, it allows them to keep all of the power. As far as energy companies are concerned, nuclear energy allows them to keep the status quo. If you're in the political centre or the political right and you're concerned about the environment from a very pragmatic point of view then nuclear energy is a very good option. It allows you to deal fairly well with the environmental issue of carbon pollution whilst maintaining inequality and supporting large industry. In comparison, renewable energy is fundamentally decentralised. Particularly with solar energy but also potentially with wind, there is a genuine potential for community ownership. This has been behind the hugely successful uptake of solar energy in Germany - local communities have been pooling money together and constructing local solar farms to provide them with their own energy. This means that they are investing in their own infrastructure, to generate power funded by the people for the people, rather than for energy companies to pay dividends to their shareholders. This has hugely brought down the cost of solar energy, to the point where energy from PV systems in Germany at the lower end is directly comparable with the cost of nuclear energy in the UK. And whilst the cost of nuclear energy has stagnated and locks governments into expensive contracts for decades, the cost of renewable energy, particularly solar energy, is plummeting. This here is the real advantage of renewable energy: it represents a transfer of power (electrical power and control) from corporations to ordinary people. Power is at the heart of everything we do these days so supporting renewable energy is probably the most powerful socialist thing you can do in the 21st Century. Supporting nuclear energy is also going to solve the environmental problem, sure, but it's also supporting the right-wing structures that we're trying to get rid of. If you don't have a problem with power remaining in the hands of energy corporations and don't see the huge advantage of energy decentralisation then whilst you may be an environmentalist, politically you're not really the target of the Green Party. 

**tl;dr:** Environmentally, nuclear energy is roughly as good as renewable energy. That isn't the problem. Economically, it costs around the same at the moment in the best case scenario and slightly less in the worst case scenario, but the cost of nuclear energy is static and the cost of renewable energy is plummeting. Socially, renewable energy represents decentralisation and a transfer of power from utility corporations to ordinary people which is one of the core values of a left-wing party like the Green Party. If you're just looking for the most politically convenient and easiest ways to rapidly decarbonise our energy infrastructure then sure, support nuclear energy.

No we're not. We're discussing medical specialities *outside* of surgery. Can I just point you in the direction of what you said previously;

&gt;Seriously, if you knew how bad the anatomy knowledge of most doctors **outside surgical specialities** is, you probably wouldn't ever go under the knife. 

There we have it - specialities *outside of surgery*. And to think you were the one to insult my literacy skills! Surgeons have a remarkable knowledge of anatomy, to say anything otherwise is ridiculous. Other specialties have less need to know the anatomy, so focus less so on it.

&gt;Actually, resits for stuff like PSA are set by the individual schools and can be structured pretty much any way they like - including resits after graduation for F1. It's pretty variable.

It's interesting you bring up the PSA, as this is the one and only exam that has absolutely nothing to do with medical schools themselves and doesn't stop you graduating from med school or qualifying as a doctor if you fail it. It's also only 2 years old and very much in its infancy, so things are likely to change year on year. Any of the 25+ exams that are sat in medical school usually have a limit of sitting them twice. I think you know this because you deliberately chose the anomaly as your example.

What, you don't like **him** as a person or you don't like his writing? Because as a person, Moffat seems like a genuinely nice person.



&gt;Written far worse than RTD

Well, that may be your opinion but I don't know if anyone could successfully argue that Moffat was a *far worse* writer than RTD.



&gt;Plot holes are laughable 

I think the amount of plot holes in the Moffat Era are vastly overstated. There have only *really* been a few cases were I've noticed an actual plot hole that I couldn't explain, or Moffat himself hasn't explained. Moreover, he doesn't write every story, so it's not like every plot hole you find is directly his fault.



&gt;Convoluted plots 

To be honest, I don't find them that convoluted, especially after a second watching. They *are* much deeper, in a way, than RTD's era but I wouldn't say they are impossible to follow.



&gt;Amy is far more loved than she should be

Well, yes, I would agree. I don't especially like Amy all that much but that's because I see her faults more prominently than her positive traits. And that's okay, I don't really mind, people can have different opinions. But you can't hate Moffat for writing a flawed character. Flawed characters are the best characters, they are the interesting characters, the real characters. No-one in real life is perfect so no-one in drama needs to be either. I appreciate the character of Amy, but I don't necessarily like her. 
I would say that Series 7A focuses too much on Amy and Rory's relationship but that's my opinion, I know some people who really liked it.



&gt;Clara is the worse companion in New Who

This is the most tiring comment I see these days, perhaps because I really like Clara. Sure, in Series 7B she didn't really develop much, but that's because she was a plot device and not a character. The story wasn't focusing on her character but rather on how she was the Impossible Girl. 
And again, you're hating a character that is flawed. In Series 8, she does develop as character, no amount of opinion can really argue that she doesn't, to be honest. She becomes much more confident in herself, and much less trusting of the Doctor. She also becomes much more capable *because* of the Doctor. 
When she destroys the TARDIS keys, that's her character. You can see how the mixture of travelling through time and space, and heartfelt love can change a person.

Rogers, Balo, Sterling, even Mignolet at times have really taken some shots here in this sub, for example.

Liverpool is a young team transitioning away from Gerrard and Suarez. When the team moves from a superstar like Suarez and legend like Gerrard to a bunch of young players, the fans should realize that it's going to take a couple of years for those young players to finish developing and gel as a team. 

Coutinho, Ibe, Can, Moreno, Balo, Markovic, Sturridge, even Henderson... all very young players. If the team was full of aging stars and performing poorly, that would be cause for lack of patience and criticizing ownership, but the team is full of very young, promising players. The fans should have been prepared and SHOULD be prepared (with Ings and Origi being very young as well) to maybe spend another year getting those players to develop before the team is successful. But, given that patience, particularly from the coaches and ownership, but also from the fans, I think they will be. I think this team has the talent already, without additional moves, to be a top 4 team, but probably needs one more year to figure out which of those players will live up to their potential and let them gel together as a team.",null,0,null,1434715516,null,0,false,0,csbrip5,null,t3_3adsrn,null,t1_csbrip5,null,t3_3adsrn,null,null,null,1437189347,null,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5,null

For Viewing at a minimum do the following, Send a letter, keep copy for yourself Stating:

•Landlord must ask (and receive) the tenant’s permission before entering the premises (you can even say this has be in writing)

you are actually under no legal obligation to allow any viewings, you will be fighting for every £ of deposit if you go this route and won't get a reference of course...

I've had to deal with similar items. These are legal rights, never mind the contract. But do check contract as if it says otherwise then for sure get Shelter on the phone or/and Citizens advice.

That's absurd. 

Religion is interpreted differently by different people, non-violent muslims are not extremists and share very little with violent extremists. It seems people are oblivious to the fact most of the people IS are killing are Muslims.

This is where the problem lies, a generalisation through pure ignorance that all Muslims are somehow agreeing with most of what extremists think just because they believe in the same god.


&gt;Should Christians take responsibility for Brevik? If religion was a motivating factor, then to some extent - yes! I think they should. (But was Christianity a factor for him? I'm not sure.)

The Good
No commuting - fuck spending two hours a day going to and from work
Get more work done due to less distractions and lack of travelling
I can work from bed, with my cat
You miss out on office gossip

The Bad
Lack of built in exercise - walking / cycling to work
Sometimes communication is tricky, things get lost, items get dropped, conferencing isn't as good as face to face
You don't have as much ambient information about what the organisation is doing outside of your realm
You miss out on office gossip
Creativity can be a bit harder as you don't always have people to bounce ideas against

Motivation for me is the same, I really care about what I do and ultimately, like any job, if you don't perform you're out. Perhaps I work even harder because the work isn't always so obvious. 

And yeah, meetings are either skype, we use a lot of email, we use glip (https://glip.com/), and we use smartsheet. We have people in every continent so sometimes they hours can be varied and long too. 

I think it ultimately comes down to what type of person you are. I'm relatively anti-social and can more than survive on my own for a day, others crave the interaction.

If they were an experienced property company I'd be amazed if they were worried about one little planning objection letter. I've almost never seen them have any affect on proposals at all.

Interesting fact: There are very few grounds upon which you can legally object to planning. You can say all you want in a letter but the planning officer won't/can't use it against an application unless it meets one of the few narrow criteria. So ultimately the objection letters 95% of people write in my experience are meaningless.

You can't do this unless the contract is being ended unfairly/illegally - there's no idication that's the case here.

&gt;, don't allow any viewings unless your tenancy agreements states you must do so

It does. They all do.

&gt;Remember you don't have to leave unless a bailiff turns up and throws you out.

Have you never rented? 99% of contracts have the option for either the tenant or the landlord to end the contract at any time after 6 months, with 2 months notice, which is exactly what happened here.

If you agree to a shitty contract, you're bound by it, and shouldn't get salty when the lanlord acts in string accordance with the contract.

But that's not my point at all. My point - as far as that particular element of what he's saying goes - is that what he is saying is couched in such general terms, and seems based on such general suppositions that it's almost literally meaningless.  
  

Lots of things are quietly condoned in local communities and might lead to some teenager going off the rails. This is because teenagers go off the rails all the time. They get drunk, they screw around, take drugs, get into fights, make bad decisions. And while I don't think teenagers going off to join a band of murderous nutters is a great idea (it's right up there with ""what happens if I try and use my T-shirt as a parachute from this 30' high wall?""), I don't think a handful of high-profile cases means we need to be unduly concerned.  

So it's not that I think he's saying that all Muslim kids are at danger, or that all teenagers are at risk from Isis. What he's saying is a small number of kids are screwing up their lives and this isn't good. And this is fine - I agree as it happens - but I hardly think the PM needs to get involved every time some teenagers balls things up. He's got a country to run; hasn't he got anything better to do with his time than get personally involved in some trumped-up scare-story? He's going to be awfully busy if he does that every time the papers make a big fuss over nothing. And no, it's not nothing to those kids and their parents, but there are about 64 million people in the UK - compared to that it's a storm in a tiny little thimble hidden somewhere in the recesses of the world's 22nd largest demographic teacup.",null,0,null,1434717155,null,0,false,0,csbs2ix,null,t3_3adt8f,null,t1_csbs2ix,null,t1_csbqorc,null,null,null,1437545718,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

null,false,Benjen_Victorious,null,null,null,"Moffat's era I think was great during Series 5, but things truly fall apart for me from Series 6 onwards. If you want to get technical about it, I think that the cracks really start showing during the Big Bang 2 part finale of Series 5. The first part is brillant, but the second half becomes so needlessly complex that it just leaves a new viewer scratching their head. Fans of Moffat I've encountered often try and sell the idea that you need to watch his series 3 or 4 times in order to pick up on all of the ""subtle nuances"" they claim are present in the writing, but in my opinion, if a writer can't clearly sell an idea to the audience on the first try, then there's something wrong. 

The end of Series 5 was really when it became clear that Moffat was sort of enamored with these vast storylines which I think he believes makes him look a lot more clever than he really is. The whole River reveal in A Good Man Goes to War was something I think the majority of us saw coming from a mile away, and the same can be said of the Missy reveal in Series 8. I also take issue with how long it takes Moffat to tell a story. His storylines seem to span 2 or 3 series at this point, and it almost always begins to feel like he has no real idea of how he wants to end a storyline until he very nearly paints himself into a corner and ends up resetting everything to go forward. Again, Moffat fans say ""Moffat plays a long game!"" to try and defend this behavior, when in actuality it's still pretty poor writing on his part to extend storylines as long as he does. It's unfair to the viewer. The most egregious example I can think of for this was Missy - bringing her in and not explaining *anything* about her backstory in the time since we last saw her was extremely poorly written stuff. 

Moffat is also terrible - and I mean godawful - at writing believeable human beings. It says a lot that Amy Pond is his best crafted character. At least we know Amy's personality, and some of her backstory. Amy's only downfall comes from her totally unbelieveable reaction to her infant child being kidnapped after Lets Kill Hitler and beyond. It's just not how a real mother would react. River *was* a good character during Series 4, but she was destroyed in Series 6 when her every whim and desire became centered around the Doctor. And Clara is the most one-dimensional companion the revived show has ever seen. We literally know next to nothing about her, and her personality changes from episode to episode depending on what the situation calls for.

null,false,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"Hi Paddy. I work in the IT industry, as I'm sure many people on this forum do.

These speed differentials are literally how the products are able to be offered at such low prices. To understand this means understanding how much bandwidth costs inside ISP's core networks and how they portion that out.

These days the average uplink in a core network will be at least 1Gbit/s. In previous years there were more esoteric systems but for the sake of sanity, and maths, let's stick with 1Gbit/s, or 1000Mbit/s.

Companies like BT (+Plusnet), Sky, Talktalk and so on, all portion out that 1Gbit/s connection depending on their margins. For instance Sky allocate roughly ~350kbit/s for each customer and might charge £7.50. They can fit 3000 users on a 1Gbit connection without overcontending it. Over the course of a month that is roughly 100GB of data transfer (1mbit/month = ~324GB). 

Now if I wanted to offer something cheaper than Sky, I might offer 175kbit/s for each customer, a 50GB total for £4. I can fit 6000 users on a 1Gbit connection. The issue with these smaller allotments is that I'm cramming more people on to that connection at peak times - when most people are using it. By paying more for a service you get a bigger slice of that pie and fewer people share that connection. It means that at peak times 6000 people are trying to use their small slice at once versus 3000 people using their slightly bigger slice at once.

People who are paying £3.50 a month on Plusnet cannot have a reasonable expectation of getting full transfer speeds at peak times. Compared to someone paying £35 a month, who could reasonably expect to get full transfer speeds at peak times.

This is simply a business model issue and there is no way around it without increasing prices.

And that's all that *anyone* has.  All religious views are just interpretations.  None being intrinsically more valid than any other.

Oh, I think religious ideology is potentially far more dangerous than guns.

Having said that - I think it's moving things a bit off topic to talk about whether religion itself is inherently dangerous or not and I don't really think it's what Cameron was trying to get at.  I think his point was more that members of religious communities have some responsibility to prevent extremism. 

Look, imagine I voluntarily joined a philosophy club in which the members are encouraged to see each-other as part of a brotherhood.

She's encountered as a puzzle, the Impossible Girl, and the Doctor treats her that way through Series 7, trying to solve the mystery. And then at the end of S7, in Name of the Doctor, it's revealed that the mystery wasn't the point, that Clara was exactly that- an ordinary girl, made extraordinary by circumstance and her own caring character. I can't help but read it as Moffat criticising himself for some of his overblown moments. 

Clara…  What is she?
She’s a girl.
Yes, but what kind of girl specifically.
She’s a perfectly ordinary girl. Very pretty. Very clever. More scared than she lets on.
And that’s it, is it?
Why? Is that not enough? 

(I think it's fair to read a lot of Moffat's run as a direct response to RTD- and the Name of the Doctor as Clara's own stare into the Vortex, mirroring Rose becoming Bad Wolf- but Doctor Who has always thrived off riffing off its own past. And Season 6 was a mess, I can't defend it against that.)

Besides, I'm not sure that ""sassy"" companions are unique to Moffat's run. Rose is chatty and confident, Donna is the ultimate in sass, Jack Harkness flirts and backtalks,  If there's one companion who isn't, it's Martha, who is much more assured- or Adam, who was so boring and kicked out so quickly! It seems like you *have* to be ""sassy"" to fit in on the Tardis. If anything, it's a consequence of the format- early evenings on the Beeb, quickfire dialogue, light entertainment in an adventure format. RTD acknowledges Whedon as a direct influence, and Whedon's known for that style of dialogue and character. Better to look at other elements- there's one list here (despite the rather aggressive title) http://stuffertystuffstuff.tumblr.com/post/99230154135/how-to-tell-moffats-women-apart-for-dumbies

But there are lots of others that look at the difference between companions. I could never imagine Clara trying to clumsily seduce the Doctor the night before her wedding, whereas for Amy- who at that point hasn't found the stability of her later seasons- this is perfectly in character. It's not justified in the show- the Doctor visibly tries to keep her off- and I'd take it as a sign of a strong character that not every action they make is a positive one.",null,0,null,1434717492,null,0,false,0,csbs725,null,t3_3ae20r,null,t1_csbs725,null,t3_3ae20r,null,null,null,1437189612,null,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5,null

Players don't change teams because they are too good for their team, they change teams for money or ambition.  If the team they are playing for is good enough to consistently compete in the top league of their country then they are good enough to field any player in the league that chooses to play for them.

I can easily imagine Coutinho playing for a lower level PL side and if he chose to sign for them then he wouldn't be too good for them.  Just because one club is viewed as ""bigger"" than another it doesn't make the other club unplayable.  For example, if Pogba left Juventus for Man City or Barcelona that doesn't mean he is too good for Juventus.  Another example would be Adam Lallana, just because he left Southampton for Liverpool doesn't mean he was too good for Southampton.

If a club can't financially compete with other clubs it doesn't make them crap or a terrible club.  It is ridiculous that people think players at clubs not in the champions league are all too good for their club.

Yes you can, if you can change the barrel of the lock without damaging the door then there is no reason why you cannot change the locks - if this is not the case please point me to something that indicates so. In fact there has previously been discussion around whether or not restricting a tenants right to change the barrel of the locks is an unreasonable restriction under the guidance on unfair terms in tenancy agreements, but I have fallen out of the loop on up to date changes.

&gt; It does. They all do.

I've been over hundreds of tenancy agreements - no they don't.

&gt; Have you never rented? 99% of contracts have the option for either the tenant or the landlord to end the contract at any time after 6 months, with 2 months notice, which is exactly what happened here.

Yes I've rented. I've also been a letting agent and now I work in a local authority in the housing department dealing with situations like this! (although I don't regularly recommend the bit about sitting around in your pants, at work) I won't be pedantic but all the advice I gave is perfectly legal and OP has the right to do it if the conditions are met.

OP has signed a contract and I did advise he checked it and if the advice I gave was going to get him into trouble - to not do it. I am sure you will be aware that many agents and landlord include terms in their contracts which upon review would be wholly unenforceable, but rely on the tenant believing they are. You're also being wilfully ignorant if you're not going to accept that the landlord/agent is taking advantage of the terrible consumer protections and tenants rights in the UK,* if* they are indeed kicking him out for objecting to planning permissions.

*""You'll Never Walk Alone""* refers to the community of Liverpool, it's fans, history and the city in general, it doesn't mean that you can't criticise footballers and managers who have been mediocre, or a club ownership that has shut many fans out with its ticket prices.

It's all well and good saying that the ""coaches and ownership"" are patient, but the fans have been waiting for years through several administrations, which either let the club stagnate, nearly destroyed it financially or had some of the worst, most embarrassing results in Liverpool's history, with nothing to show for it apart from one year where they could have won something but didn't.

I'm not even a Liverpool fan but it annoys me whenever people tell Liverpool fans to ""Be patient"", they've been supporting the club long before Rodgers and FSG got there, and they'll be supporting it long after they are gone.",null,0,null,1434718350,null,0,false,0,csbsj06,null,t3_3adsrn,null,t1_csbsj06,null,t1_csbrip5,null,null,null,1437189884,null,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4,null

To a certain extent, I don't even think that matters. If the contract has a 2 month notice period on the break clause, then who cares why they are ending the contract? It's in line with the contract you signed and agreed to.

Every time I start renting, I always renegotiate so that the break clause can't be invoked unless the tenant, me, does something against the terms set out elsewhere in the contract, i.e. damaging things, disturbing neigbours etc. If you agree to a contract, it's on you to read and abide by it, and to be happy with the restrictions on the other party.",null,1,null,1434718655,null,0,false,0,csbsnj0,null,t3_3adzaa,null,t1_csbsnj0,null,t1_csbsf4e,null,null,null,1437189967,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

Since when was it standard practice to have landlords ""randomly"" bring folks around to look at the property? Most landlords, not being cunts, have the common decency to ask the tenant if it would be okay and give notice. Most tenants, not being cunts, have the common decency to understand where the landlord is coming from, that it's not a big deal, and to give permission.

But most crucially, most landlords have the brains to have clauses in the tenancy agreement that give them the right to show people around the property during the notice period - and tenants who consistently refuse this (as well as the right of the property owner to access his property with 24 hours notice) without good reason are in contravention of the agreement and the law and have no rights where the house is concerned.

* Secondly, of course the PM should be taking Isis seriously because he is the leader of the country and should be evaluating threats to the UK, and taking part in world events, but excluding the entirety of Exeter suddenly upping sticks and moving to Syria all at once I'm not sure he needs to get personally involved in the nitty-gritty of each particular case of someone leaving the UK to join Isis;
* Thirdly, although 600 UK citizens going to join Isis is some cause for concern ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant) - it's an approximation) is of only slightly more cause for concern than the [500 pedestrian deaths](http://www.roadsafetywales.co.uk/statistics/) that occurred on UK roads in 2013. The numbers are comparable as a percentage of the UK population - about 0.0009%;

2.  There isn't a pool of 5,000 GPs sitting on their hands waiting for the right job to come along.  It takes at least 10 years to train a GP when you include medical school.  People finishing medical school don't want to do it (see 1).  Being a GP in Canada (where you can make $300 per hour) or Australia/NZ (considerably better working conditions and a copayment system) means that many people who do want to be a GP will strongly consider emigrating.  Or, you'll just locum, and choose not to work at the weekend.  Prices for weekend cover will increase and become unaffordable.

3.  Ten million pounds averaged across the number of potential patients in England works out as about 16 pence per patient.  How much does it cost you to take your hamster to the vet?

4.  Forcing doctors to work at the weekend will mean they aren't working at some other point during the week, so no net increase in the number of appointments.

5.  Single-handed or rural surgeries will be forced to close if they are forced to cover at weekends.

6.  The whole thing smacks of political expediency rather than pragmatism.  Great for employers (no more sick days for the plebs to see their doctor during *my* time, thanks!) and will look good for the Tories, but the likely reality is the minimum increase in the level of cover required for it to count as a ""delivery"".

*****
In 2007 we put money down on a 4-man flat rental in Stirling. I was neurotic about getting a place for 4th year, so put money down on a new flat in February for a June movein. Flat 4a; sweet! 

Late (*fucking*) May we get a call saying that:

a. We need to find a 5th person for our 5 man flat, or the deal's off. What?

b. We need to provide about £500 each as a guarantor thing, in *addition* to the deposit. *What?*

We never found a 5th person but they let us move into a 5-man flat just the 4 of us (having stressed to hell), and we mustered another £500 each somehow. The only downside was that the flat's weren't ready, and we could move in in July. **What!?** 

So we all managed to find short-term accommodation for the month (Stirling uni rent out their halls over the summer and are cheap as chips, folks), but apparently all of these students - Chinese folk with nowhere else to go - were showing up at the estate agents on June 1st, eager to move in. A nice woman at the place - Slater Hogg, Stirling - said it was *horrible*. 

It was all managed by a woman who went on to make B-Spoke lettings (http://www.bspokeproperty.com/), and I reckon was sabotaging Slater Hogg's name as she wasn't around to take the blame. 

The punchline to the whole thing: our Flat 4a, the 4-man flat that never was, was taken by 4 1st year girls who'd swanned into Slater Hogg in mid-May, and been given our flat. Fuck the 4 boys, they'll be fine, eh? Fuck Slater Hogg and B-Spoke lettings. Fuck 'em.

Within the last year I've seen more and more posts and shares by friends on social media about men in white vans stealing dogs, going door to door pretending they're selling fish but actually scouting for dogs, marking houses with paint/chalk/sticks to show that there's dogs there etc...

And these posts are always the usual breathlessly angry and accusatory but equally vague and second-hand accounts. And as far as I can tell no one specifically has actually had their dog stolen, but it's always 'dogs have been taken from this area...'. Yet nothing has really hit the local press about it. 

A friend had 'suspicious markings' outside her house last night and posted it all over FB today full of speculation and warnings to others, and obviously she's sure she's seen the same white van parked at the end of the road for a few days now, so 1+1= gypsies are gonna steal her dogs. Although a more rational friend pointed out that the markings on the road look like they're related to water mains work/surveys.

So is this actually a thing now, are people having their dogs stolen on a national scale by what I assume are organised gangs? Is there a market for dogs to be resold, or is it for fighting? Or maybe meat? Anyone got any more info about it?

Or is this nothing more than the usual hoax bullshit that goes round FB, just like ""This shopkeeper refused to serve a man in army uniform, share if you support our troops"" or whatever.

Ultimately, I can see your point of view but both sides of this culture war engage in pushing their agenda.

It doesn't help that you immediately discredit the Orange Order by calling it a ""weird religious brotherhood."" In fact, it hurts your argument a little to describe them like that, after all, pretty much all religions can be described as weird if it doesn't agree with your understanding of the world. What this museum/event is doing, is allowing people to learn about this ""weird religious brotherhood"" so that at least you can understand where the weirdness came from. Knowledge leads to understanding, after all.

I don't think it is a bad idea for anyone to learn about the history of the orange order, or any part of the history of this island for the record. It might help everybody on all three sides of the divide (nationalist, loyalist and those who don't care) understand the others point of view better.

The Empty Child/Doctor Dances, great. Eccleston pulls off a great performance and over all is a great addition to the series with the whole ""Just this once, everybody lives.

Girl in the fireplace, also great. Not much to say but it's a very good stand alone episode. 

Blink. His episodes just get better and better, no wonder everyone thought it was a good idea to get him as show runner. 

Library two parter I also really like. I don't like it as much as his previous episodes but is still very good with a great introduction to River Song. 


Now series 5. It starts pretty well, Matt Smith is a good doctor. Eleventh hour is an excellent opener, just a bit of an overuse of the ‘I am the doctor’ theme which happens so much in the matt smith series’. Angel two parter however overcomplicated the weeping angels. They worked SO well in Blink as just these hunting statues. Not this army type thing with a future church and addition of the ‘looking into their eyes turns you into one’. I felt he completely ruined it by showing one move. That blows away so much of what the weeping angels are about. It was also a poor introduction for River Song in my opinion. I’m not sure why moffat didn’t make it that the doctor hasn’t seen her since the library two parter. He could’ve really put in some great character moments, but he just makes it that he already knows her. Not to mention River just turns into another doctor obsessed female in Moffat’ era. 

I’m brushing through episodes here, don’t want to cover all of them. Vincent and the doctor and the lodger are great episodes in my opinion and do add to the series. 

The finale however gets overblown with ‘rebooting the universe’. Everything just gets quite silly IMO and I feel like Moffat lost a grip on everything he was building to. I hate how River seems to just remember him then Amy does, then Rory and what’s even better, is when the doctor lands the Tardis IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEDDING! With everyone sitting around the ship, but they just don’t blink an eye and question a blue box appearing before their eyes. Background Moffat people are so unrealistic. 

Anyway, I’ll talk more about the next few series in more parts but for now, this is the first part. ",null,1,null,1434721182,null,0,false,0,csbtrib,null,t3_3ae20r,null,t1_csbtrib,null,t3_3ae20r,null,null,null,1437190414,null,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1,null

Their vote would give them less than a 0.0000001% say in the final decision (and they wouldn't have a huge turnout, either).

This leads them to seeking like minded people within the community, often at a mosque in the same way that pensioners may go to U3A, women to the WI, Christians to church etc etc... it's about wanting a social connection for the most part I think.

While certain sections of society would scoff at me and say that multiculturalism has failed, I would tentatively suggest that it has failed not because of an unwillingness to adopt ""our"" culture, but because of unwillingness on our part to accept that ""our"" culture has failed to modernise.

Since moving to East Anglia I can't help but notice both the conservatism and the Conservative support. In my local during the last week of election campaigning there was much muttering of multiculties ruining everything and immigrants taking over the UK. I took a look around the pub: 100% white, probably anglo-saxons. Nothing but British accents. Middle England is very much this sort of demographic, and it's no wonder that immigrants and the recent descendants of immigrants (even 3rd / 4th generation) feel isolated whan they are not even viewed as British by many. When young British men and women feel that they are not even accepted as being British then they are bound to go looking for acceptance elsewhere.

For them religion is a convenient outlet for that frustration. In many ways we're lucky that folks of Afro-Caribbean descent were predominantly Christian - during the 70s and 80s they had plenty of cause for unhappiness arising from the attitudes of middle-England. In more than 40 years the overall attitude of white Brits hasn't changed, but then that's what conservatism (small c) is all about of course.

So maybe I have pinpointed that lacking quality after all. A lack of progressiveness? A lack of modernity or willingness to modernise? I think modernisation suits some better than others, and for people with conservative views they are happy to cherry-pick the modernisations that suit them best. At heart people (not just the people of Britain) fear change, which is perhaps understandable but a continual source of frustration for so, so many.

With an extreme example like IS, don't forget that these are young, impressionable and disillusioned people that have very few outlets for their own frustrations. For them it's possible that IS offers one, in the same way that, I dunno, joyriding, binge-drinking, drugs etc may provide a similar outlet for other disillusioned kids.

It's only going to get worse as well: young people generally have difficulty fitting into society for a number of reasons: lack of jobs, boredom, poor education, poor parenting, the list goes on. I think it's fair to say that up until the age of about 30 (arbitrary) people make some questionable, even bad decisions. Admittedly very few decide to hop on a plane to Syria to play Call of Duty: Jihadi Fuckfest, but many of those who do I'm sure eventually realise that they have done a pretty fucking dreadful thing. Some are persuaded that it is indeed a holy thing that they do, those that are not will most likely be killed their own colleagues. Any that survive and attempt to return home will not be met with sympathy: most likely the exact opposite, rightly or wrongly.

Turning into quite the essay. Whoops.

This can easily be dismissed as leftist liberalist woolly thinking. I fully accept that. Getting an idiotic tattoo is not the same as beheading people in Iraq. But they are both still bad decisions. A soft hearted liberal would say that young people need better options when making a choice, a fervent conservative rightist would say fuck 'em, you make the wrong choice, you pay for it.

I’d like to think there can be some middle ground, but the truth be told there will never be a one-size-fits-all solution. However until the general population of the UK can recognise that their own attitudes and mentalities should come under scrutiny, it’s unfair to expect other minority groups, be they ethnic, religious, sexual, etc to fully conform with the expectations of the rest. Unfortunately in the blame culture and the frothing of a horrendously biased media this is unlikely to happen for another generation at least. Maybe not for a lifetime.

Seeing as I’ve got the day off I’m in the process of trying to get my hands on some more (free) music. 

In order to do this I tried to update to a newer version of [Frostwire](http://www.frostwire.com/ ) but for some reason it deleted the old version entirely and made me start completely from scratch. 

Sneakily, they seem to be trying to send out loads of bloatware alongside it (such as the [Ask toolbar](http://www.howtogeek.com/138516/the-shameful-saga-of-uninstalling-the-terrible-ask-toolbar/)) buy, luckily, I’m a paranoid git that actually reads the screeds of terms and conditions on these things.

At the moment I’ve developed a thing for the [music of Simply Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CceulSzxO8Q) but am still reluctant to admit this publically ‘cause Mick Hucknall’s an indescribably irritating human being (and indorsing him makes me feel all dirty).

I mean The Guardian article mentions 'roid rage' but that wasn't observed in the controlled study and HIV infection is due to poor needle hygiene which would be greatly improved if the drugs weren't illegal.

Similarly conflating the risks when someone is also using other drugs is a bit unfair and wouldn't be done with any other substance - we don't try to ban alcohol because people that use alcohol and also take heroin suffer bad health.

This health timebomb is entirely avoidable and is simply due to the nation's infantile drug laws. We should legalise all drugs.

Whilst the encampment remains we will continue to monitor the site with the police.

&gt;Goldman's appointment may prove to be controversial given criticism of its role advising the Treasury on the nationalisation of Northern Rock in 2008, and its securities division's interest in buying Granite, a £13bn mortgage portfolio put up for sale by the Chancellor earlier this year.

So advised on nationalisation while helping its security division buy Granite?

&gt;Underlining the web of relationships managed by investment banks, the Wall Street giant worked with Bradford &amp; Bingley on its attempts to stave off collapse in 2008, and attempted to broker a rescue deal led by TPG - one of the firms that Goldman is now partnering with in an effort to buy the Granite assets.

is now partnered with a company to but assets it already advised on?

&gt;To add a further layer of complexity, Goldman will be advising UKFI on the sale of its shareholding in RBS, while also competing against RBS as a rival bidder in the Granite auction.

Ok my head hurts now....

and the Gideon says this:

&gt;I was not responsible for the bailout of RBS or the price paid then for shares bought by the taxpayer: but I am responsible for getting the best deal now for the taxpayer and doing whatever I can to support the British economy.

really? best fucking price? 

&gt;""There is no doubt that starting to sell the Government’s stake in RBS is the right thing to do on both counts.""

no its not, really... keep hold of the shares and collect the Dividends, wait till price goes up then sell the fuckers without announcing to the entire world, which only results in the share price plummeting as they get shorted..

Enacted means the act has passed through Parliament and gained Royal Assent, but acts can (and usually do) contain specific provisions about when their provisions come into force.

&gt; (effective from commencement date 26 March 2015)

Only applies to the clauses related to deposits which did come in to force on the day the act passed.

&gt; acts, if they don't have a commencement date, are valid from midnight on the day that Queeny signs off.

But this act does have specific [commencement provisions](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/20/section/115/enacted).  Only a small part of it came into force immediately. s33 requires a commencement order.

From your own first link:
""Section 21 and Retaliatory Evictions (effective from day to be appointed by order) [1st July 2015: Sections 37 - 39 | 1st October 2015: Sections 33 - 41]""

So section 33 won't be effective until October (and it would appear to start with will only apply to tenancies starting after that date).

I tried to avoid mentioning specifics but if you honestly don't see the relevance then here are a couple of examples:

First off the top of my head is the Byzantine iconoclasty: all sorts of thigns happened tio bring this about: the great schism and one group deciding that imagery of god and christ was heretical, leading to a hell of a lot of stuff being destroyed. Other people were outraged by this and there followed many murders and much wailing and gnashing of teeth.

Second a little more recent: Fascist Italy, Fascist Spain and a little-known political group in Germany called National Socialists: all three used book burnings as a warring cry, and such symbolism is still used (along with various logos, phrases and ideaologies) by certain far right groups today. Oh yeah, there were also many murders and much wailing and gnashing of teeth.

Modern day of course looks at ISIS / ISIL and suchlike. They are already burning books, destroying ancient structures and effigies, and there are a few other things going on as well, you know, as well as casual fridays there happens to be the odd beheading. Not to mention many murders and much... well, you get the picture.

The relevance, for me at least, is this: Using that sort of destructive behaviour is synonymous with murders, wailing and gnashing of teeth, and extreism generally. Book burning is often the catalyst or call to arms for much worse things. Not saying that if you go tearing up a Quran you're going to commit atrocities but surely you admit that whatever your motives for doing something destructive other people will link this (however incorrectly) to extremism? Basically if you go ripping up a Quran in public your actions would result in a lot of unhappy people, some of whom will reprt you to the authorities for committing a hate crime, and maybe even provoking one or two others to a violent act towards you. Without getting all Da Vinci Code on yo' ass, I would remind you that a symbolic gesture is never just that: a symbolic gesture.

&gt;Burning a book doesn't hurt anyone

Xbox games are going to cost you 40$ only if you buy them from gamestop they milk these parents of kids who have xbox or ps4. Even cdkeys.com has sweet digital sales for consoles. And even xbox gold membership goes on sale http://www.cdkeys.com/xbox-live/memberships/12-month-xbox-live-gold-membership-xbox-360

And with the gold membership you get 2 free games every month on your xbox one and 2 on your xbox 360 now add that to your backwards compatibility thats 4 games for your xbox one for 5$ a month. I am not saying it has better deals than PC. I will eventually build a PC during the console's late years because thats what I usually do or when they announce the next Elders scroll game.

&gt;__AT&amp;T Stadium__, formerly known as __Cowboys Stadium__, is a city-owned 85,000-seat capacity  stadium with a retractable roof in [Arlington, Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas), United States. It serves as the home of the [Dallas Cowboys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys) (one of the most valuable sports clubs in the world with a value of $2.3 billion ) of the [National Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League) (NFL). It replaced the partially covered [Texas Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Stadium), which opened in 1971 and served as the Cowboys' home through the 2008 season. It was completed on May 27, 2009. The facility can also be used for a variety of other activities outside of its main purpose (professional football) such as concerts, basketball games, college football and high school football contests, soccer matches, and [motocross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motocross) races.

Given that book burnings have been commonplace over the years an irrational person who witnesses such an act may either take offence at his / her religion being insulted or liken the person doing the burning to the Nazis. Or worse, both.

I'm all for freedom of speech, and it is a sad indication of the times that it's virtually impossible to express yourself freely and without fear of upsetting someone or causing violence. But to me book burnings are not about freedom of speech. To me they represent some of humankind's darker periods, and should be vehemently discouraged. My opinion.

Being a landlord shouldn't be like running a business. It's offering a service, on which I think there's quite a serious onus on the provider to serve their customers well. It's not just that you're providing a roof for your tenants, it's that a major aspect of their total quality of life derives directly from the work you do for them. It's a heavy responsbility to carry, and it's one that, absolutely, should be taken seriously, and as an intrinsic part of the role. I've done my time in big businesses, doing customer service. There's something deeply fucked up about a scenario where a supermarket cares more about a regular customer or an IT company cares more about a positive customer service experience than a landlord cares about a family he provides a home for.

another scenario i could plausibly see if that we spend 15m on clyne, 18m on kovacic and use the remaining 7 towards buying another striker. if we sell borini, lambert, balo, enrique, coates, and possibly lucas for somewhere between 20-35m, we'd have more than enough money to buy another striker and buy those players. 

those are the two scenarios i would like to see personally, and i'd like to see them tied up quickly.

Rabiot would be amazing for us. He's not a destroyer or a DM; he's a very traditional CM but with a great eye for getting forward. The kid has scored some really quality goals for PSG this season. 

I do wonder if that would make our midfield. I think a Rabiot/Bentaleb pairing would be interesting. My only issue is that they may be too similar. Both are solid defensively: I think that Rabiot has had better tutelage, playing alongside and subbing for Thiago Motta (imo, one of the best CDMs even in his older age) but Bentaleb seems to have the better head for it. Rabiot is defenitely a better offensive option. He makes good runs and has a decent shot from outside the box. Sometimes he copies Bentaleb &amp; Mason's ""Thirty Feet Over The Bar"" shots, but not as often. That'll change with age.

But I worry that, without a out-and-out DM, that we'll still have positional and back-line issues. The only way I'd like to see a Rabiot/Bentaleb midfield is if Poch can turn Bentaleb into more of a Capoue/Schneiderlin player. 

There is something to be concerned with his mother, however. The kid always works hard on the pitch and you can tell he's anxious to play. But I fear that his mother is too absurd to be dealt with.

And just as a PSA - I can't see Cabaye doing well for us. The guy is as injury prone as Kyle Walker. He's also been in bad form when he's played, though (understandably) this may be because he's often injured and isn't used to getting first team minutes. But even then, Laurent Blanc is much more likely to bring on Rabiot than Cabaye. 

If we were going to spend 10million, I'd much rather spend it on Rabiot than Cabaye. Again, always a risk. But the kid is tall, decently strong, good with the ball at his feet, good passer, good shot, reads the game pretty well. And he's only 20. 

There is something to be said for the similarity between Adrien's play and Dembele's style. He' isn't, of course, on the same dribbling level as the Belgian maestro, but speed-wise, they're similar, Rabiot being a little bit quicker at full stride.

The step that is mathematically incorrect is going from 2^a^a / 8^a trying to cancel the ""to the a"" on the top and bottom to 2^a / 8.

Firstly, there's no way you can cancel indices like that because the value of the indice depends on the number it is above. If you cancel 3 from the top and bottom for example, you are reducing both the numerator and the denominator by a factor of three and therefore it is mathematically correct. Here, you are changing the top and bottom by different margins since you do not know 2
^a and 8 is the same.

Therefore the only way you can cancel indices is if the number it is describing is the same. So you can cancel 2a^a / 8a^a to just 2/8 since the a is describing the a on both the top and the bottom.

There is clearly some sort of internal issue but at which level is not clear - but there's something.  There are certainly elements in the media that will declare fire at the first smell of smoke, not that that doesn't apply to other non-UKIP stories, but there are some media elements that are somewhat obsessed with finding a UKIPian smoke trail.  Then of course there are some political elements that would love to whip up a public sense of divide, even if it doesn't quite exist.

But the short-term reaction to the story is often worse than the actuality once it all dies down and the details come out.

If you do an emergency first aid course one of the fist things they teach you is to not enter a scenario if your being there is going to make the situation worse or if you're putting yourself in unwarranted danger.  You don't run into a car crash site when the cars are still piling up.  You don't rush to help someone who's been electrocuted  to keep their heart beating - you switch off the electricity.  You don't run into a burning building if it means the firefighters are now going to be looking for two people not one.

The principle carries.

Often it is better, certainly from a Kipper perspective, to stand back and assess the situation.  Charging in with supposition and drawing premature battle lines fuel a media-frenzy, and actually conflates a proper understanding or reporting of the story.   A focus on the frenzy not the facts.

I think it's absolutely clear why the media would suddenly go to Godfrey Bloom, and know with precognitive certainty the narrative he will provide.   Yet yesterday, without even knowing the source, people were unknowingly adding to the spin.  It now transpires that the line coming out of UKIP is that the source was an unofficial line briefing against Suzanne Evans.  Maybe more will come of it, but if nothing does then the premature speculation will be what people will remember and it will become a self-fulfilling prophesy.

Can will assume the CDM role we need cover in and Milner and Henderson will be able to boss the midfield with sheer stamina.

I'd expect us to sign more players as well, perhaps another attacker and the right purchase there could be important. Most of all, I think BR is good at player development and that will be evident next season. Tl;dr Top four challengers.
